This book has shown me the wonderful world of Emacs and its many modes. For very fast editing of text files and search/replace operations, vi is still the best. But for anything else, Emacs is a real time saver. I work a lot with the Fortran and LaTeX modes (with the AUCTeX package) and they both have saved me countless keystrokes, particularly with LaTeX.  I find it convenient to keep this book nearby for reference as Emacs' has far too many commands to keep in one's head. It is *certainly* a very good introductory and reference book to Emacs. I will not write Lisp code in my life and the information given here is sufficient for me. Another user has mentioned that rtin and Lynx are better, but most often, you have install another dozen packages before you can use them (atleast if you *don't* use a Linux machine). Gnus works well enough for my occasional newsreading.  I highly recommend this book for the 95% that are not too interested in heavy customization or esoteric uses. I most certainly will buy an extra copy to keep as a reference.	2001-02-14

Linda Goodman seems to characterize most sun signs well. Every sign has a man, woman and child profile. For example, leo man, leo woman and leo child. The descriptions are fun to read. It helps me understand certain behavior from other people (which is sometimes irritating to say the least) The major criticism is that Linda seems to have a preconceived notion about certain things. For instance, on her web site, it is said &quot;Presidents should be never from a mutable sign.&quot; And then she goes on to say why Lyndon Johnson and Kennedy were not suitable for the president's post. I for one, believe that hard work will yield the results, not the sun sign you were born under and who is Linda to decide who is a fit or misfit? We all saw how a fire sign (Linda is fond of saying she is a &quot;double&quot; aries fire sign) president did ! (Bill Clinton) Just keep in mind that a sun sign (or a moon sign or star sign) cannot pigeonhole people. The fact is people are JUST TOO UNIQUE. They ARE CAPABLE of doing whatever they SET THEIR MINDS ON.	2001-02-03

Of the several FE programming texts in the market, I found this book to be the most simple and easy to understand. The authors have a clear writing style that makes the book very easy to understand. The programs are in Fortran, but that is not a great obstacle. The book &quot;Finite elements in plasticity: Theory and practice&quot; by the same authors shows how nonlinear programs should be coded.

It has got so many negative votes (3/26) that I decided to update the info. Here goes..<br />First and foremost, this book is not something you should start learning from. I started learning it in May and became fully comfortable using it for a lot of things by mid-october. So if you plan to write a thesis using it, don't jump in. Consider the following things before starting using it:<br />a) Does your thesis/dissertation have a lot of formulas and mathematics? This is where Word is weak, but be sure to investigate alternatives like Scientific Word. b) Are you willing to put in a lot of effort learning the package? The rewards are well worth it, but it is also probable that you will be frustrated a lot.<br />This book proved an invaluable reference for me once I knew the basics. But I can honestly say that I *did not* learn from it. My major source of learning was the internet (for basic info) and the comp.text.tex newsgroup where beginners' questions are answered very promptly by experts. <br />By the way, I did finish writing my thesis using LaTeX and it looks beautiful.	2000-12-28

It has a clear way of making us thinking of putting the more important things first in our life. In particular, I remember the example of putting the big rocks in the jar first and packing the rest of the material (sand, smaller rocks) around them. It was a nice analogy. <br />As for the cons, I think this book in particular has a lot of material that really doesnot have to be the way it is given. For example, &quot;Win-Win&quot;, &quot;Synergistic thinking&quot;, &quot;Circle of influence&quot;, &quot;Shared vision&quot; etc etc etc., I like such phrases because they help me remember the points mentioned, but the book is so full of them I got a little put off. I mean, a phrase like this on every second page! <br />Overall, a recommended buy for everyone. From students to CEO s.	2000-11-17

Given the amount of praise Amazon's customers have given it, I expected it to help me resolve my indecision. (I have three major fields to choose from) Nope, it does not. It's a good book, but it doesnot come anywhere close to &quot;The Pathfinder&quot; (which in my opinion, is the BEST). Barbara and Paul Tieger's &quot;Do what you are&quot; is second. My view is that once you can target what you want, getting it is a lot easy. You will not then need any special techniques or tricks because your heart will show the way. Get &quot;The Pathfinder&quot; first and do all the exercises there. Maybe you won't need this one then.	2000-10-11

I purchased this book at the book store. The nice thing is that it comes  with SuSe 6.3 CD. However, my reason for purchasing it was different. I  already had a SuSE linux retail box and wanted to install it on my old  pentium laptop (133 Mhz; MS-Office unbearably slow). I expected the book to  cover laptop installation in detail. It does not. My laptop has a swappable  floppy+cd-rom combination. (not hot-swappable)The BIOS is also incapable of  booting from CD-ROM.  The book doesnot even mention this case. I finally  formatted the disk with the Windows95 setup disk, installed DOS drivers for  the CDROM and used the setup.exe on the CD that came with my SuSE box.  Apart from this, all the other sections appear to be good. My advice is  this: Get the SuSE installation manual from someone or download the docs  from the net. Particularly for a book devoted entirely to installing linux,  I could not accept the lack of information.	2000-09-06

Both books on mechanics of materials by Den Hartog are remarkable. All the  questions have answers, the writing is clear and to the point. In this  book, he gives the method of Myosotis to calculate the deflections of  beams. Although such material is outdated, it does illustrate an elegant  way of solving beam deflection problems. Today, many problems are being  solved by brute-force computer methods. (Just make an FE mesh!!) Read this  book even though it will not teach you anything new, if only like a novel.	2000-08-25

I am in the process of writing a master's thesis and purchased this book  to see if it can help me overcome the (initial) inertia. The best advice I  got from the book was &quot;Write first&quot;. Of course, that's what  everybody has told me for a long time, but Bolker's advice on realistic  expectations (atleast in the beginning) and not being perfectionistic are  good ways to get started. It would have been useful if she had included  information for science and engineering students (like me), but the content  is good as it is. It would be a good idea to revise the book with more  information on word processing and other computer related information. I  finished this book very quickly and as I mentioned, I keep reminding to  myself &quot;Write first&quot; whenever I get struck on something.	2000-08-11

It will tell you how you end up wasting time and what to do  about it in a positive way. I would like to mention a couple of ideas that  I found in this book: a) No matter how silly, do something related to work  with a high pay-off. b) Effectiveness (doing the important things) should  be preferred over efficiency (Doing something of not much importance very  well)<br />I read this book every week and have got an additional copy to  carry in my bag always to get these excellent ideas entrenched in my head.	2000-05-27

This book, along with a design  handbook is a must have for any mechanical engineer. Also as another  reviewer mentioned, it comes in real handy when checking FE analyses.  Because most of the text gives formulas, checking your mesh becomes very  easy. But this is not a &quot;one-stop&quot; design book.

I bought this book a couple of months ago, planning to write my thesis using it. In the beginning, I could not comprehend what was going on. After a while, I started understanding it, but the number of times I needed to refer to the book even to do something simple exasperated me in no time.  While it's true that the quality of the output is superlative to word  processing packages, I wonder if it's worth the time you need to put into  it.

MS Word began to look more and more attractive to me and I managed to get  an automatic table of contents using the styles options in it.

I got this book wishing to understand myself so I don't waste time in a wrong career. Having taken the Keirsey online test, I scored to be an INTJ.  However, I wasnot sure if it was correct. This book gives a lot of examples  and more importantly, points out how different people of the same type in  different careers still show their preferences. This was a very big  enlightenment for me because all the web sites that I checked had very  little practical info on the use of type to select a career. As with all  standard disclaimers, type is only one of many things which influence our  choice of career. But reading this book has certainly made me more aware of  what I exactly want. I know now that I am an INXJ although the book  discusses only INTJ and INFJ not one on the wall. I am now sure as to which  careers would be more suitable to me. One less worry at night!	2000-04-13

It would help if you have a previous background in solid  mechanics, but even that has been explained in a simple fashion. The  exercises at the end are what attracted me most.

As a devout hindu, I feel compelled to say Deepak is making a business of both hinduism and christianity and understands neither. Christianity and other religions in hinduism's point of view follow the &quot;karma yoga&quot; path. That is, trust God more than yourself and everything will  be fine. However hinduism doesnot suggest that it is the only way. If we  were rational, we should realize that paths put down by religion didnot  come from GOD, they came from PEOPLE. After all, what is the guarantee that  Manu's teachings or even Christ's teachings are what we know from the  books. They represent opinions of people, not GOD's be he one or a dozen.  The only way to understand religion is as we do with science. DO what  religion asks you to do and if doesnot work, discard it with an open mind,  regardless of who proposed it. But the key word is doing. And I wonder if  Deepak has done that. Religion is a notoriously difficult subject to  practise, but the end goal is worth it. Somewhat obligated to answer the  previous reviewer on hinduism, it's true that hindus worship cows as gods,  it is because it teaches us to see god in everything on this planet. The  idea is simple. You are God not because no one else is, but you are God  because everyone is God's manifestation. If he is the supreme father, we  carry his genes, don't we? God is only one, I accept, but like the sun, he  could be reflected in many things.	2000-03-12

The basics of the language are covered well, but you should have your textbook  handy. There are a few mistakes (not mistakes really, but the author didnot  want to bring in all the complexities). As a college text, I was looking  for some more math based examples, but there aren't too many. The ones he  does give don't use adequate formatting of the results.

Engineering mechanics is a hands-on course. It won't help you any good to read the textbook for 10 hours at a stretch if you don't attempt to understand the problem and solve it yourself. The best thing about this  subject is that once you get the basics, you can pretty much read it on  your own and understand everything. There are only three laws (thanks to  Newton) and everything else is deduction. This book has lots of problems  and they are very practical too. You can see most of the problems around  you, like the one on a safety mechanism for a construction worker and there  are many such problems. I am not in any way affiliated or related to the  publishers or the authors. In summary, a great book for a TOUGH subject.

In India, we use the metric system exclusively and the initial hurdle was often getting the right answers in US customary units. Inspite of the US's adamancy in  sticking to fps units, metric has its own advantages. You need not use W/g  where mass is involved and secondly, no confusion over the units for the  acceleration due to gravity. The part on dynamics is very good and  detailed. It must be however be noted that the branch of mechanics is very  old and you could find any number of books that will explain the concepts  equally well. Some of the problems are also really good. I had friends who  used to feel smug after solving all problems in the chapter and finding  that the results match with the authors'. And in a course like mechanics,  that is a REAL confidence booster.	1999-11-21

I had a look at this book in the library and spent nearly 3 hours fully immersed. As an ardent vi user, I was really happy at the coverage given to  ed and vi. This is not to say that other utilities are not covered. In fact  they are covered in so much detail that I am afraid I will never use them.  This book is not for beginners though. A little expectation is necessary to  make the most of it. If you have ever wondered why running a .cshrc script  with csh doesnot work (use the source command) or why your terminal goes  into a hang with Emacs (you may have pressed &lt;Ctrl+s&gt; inadvertently),  you will benefit greatly from this book. The book is true to its name. You  won't go work with a power chain saw after using a kitchen knife, will you?  Everytime I see it in the library, I am tempted to buy it on Amazon, and I  know I will, someday, the day I decide I am going to try out all thos  **POWER** commands. Till then......(sigh!!!)	1999-11-01

I consider myself lucky to get started on 'C' with this book. I tend to get demotivated by any book over 600 pages. It's my opinion that a good  author gives the gist of the subject in a few pages, not 10,000; and that  what Stephen Kochan does. Kochan explains beautifully the main concept of  'C': functions. I have never been disappointed by Kochan's books. These are  the early versions of Oreilly books.	1999-10-29

I routinely  handle my data files in fortran rather than go all the way writing 'C'  code. Reading/writing arrays with a single statement, good math functions,  universal availability etc make fortran a very good scientific tool. (more  like an advanced calculator). I will rather write a small fortran program  than calculate something in my head. Some scientific packages use fortran  as their base language, so a knowledge of fortran is not going to be  wasted. And so math/science books use fortran, so you will definitely  benefit if you can understand the language. You could probably translate  one of those into C/C++ and make some easy money.	1999-10-27

Yes, I tried closing it using File menu and everything worked normally. As far as suggestions to the user interface are concerned,  I would suggest the following: 1) Please remove the red color titles etc.,  They are annoying and very hard to read. Atleast provide an option for  changing it. 2) If possible, instead of cramming all the information on one  screen, split it between a couple of screens with a next button or  something similar. 3) A couple of tutorials would be helpful for learning  to use the software.

This one is superb for its plot and the way it is developed around an ancient poem about ten indians. The most classic line in the  poem(&amp;story) would probably be &quot;A red herring got him&quot;.  However, Christie's stories donot have a very good character introduction.  They are somewhat dumped on us in the first few pages. Professor Moriarty  would object to that.	1999-09-27

If you are looking for an instant &quot;look it up&quot; algorithm, you will find it here. No elaborate theory, but what is given in the book will work quite well for most folks. In contrast to what another reader has  said, I like the idea of being able to use either zero-based or one-based  arrays. It is somewhat difficult to code when you have to start your arrays  at zero. I think it is an irritating feature in an otherwise excellent  language. I am waiting for a C++ or better still, a java version with lots  of applets!	1999-09-01

Now I am a foreign student who wants to learn to play the piano/keyboard, because of interest in Western music. All the songs in the book are totally unfamiliar  to me. I know I am in the minority, but I will certainly appreciate it if  the publishers include a audio cassette/CD which has the songs in it. Like  those programming books which have the source on the CD-ROM. My keyboard  has some songs in-built but I don't know how &quot;Silent night...&quot;  should sound, so I am stuck at the very first song. Otherwise the approach  in the book is good.	1999-08-28

But for the software, the author forgot basic windows UI conventions. The programs donot clean up after themselves. For instance, you run the fourbar, sixbar and engine  programs. You won't be able to run any other program after that. (I have a  32 Meg machine and the programs themselves consume only about 5Mb so I  would expect their memory use to be small) This looks like a windows port  of a program that is basically DOS based. Some windows conventions are  totally ignored. For example, who would create a button with red text and  which looks like a grayed out button? Looks like it was written in VB4.  Imagine what a great interface could have been provided. No, the program is  designed for a 17 or 21&quot; monitor and you donot have the standard  windows close or open buttons at the top. And the manual CTRL+ALT+DELETE  approach to closing the program... Forget it. Download one of the best  mechanism software on ASME's site. Accepted that one is DOS based, but  atleast it doesnot gobble your memory... Go for Sandor and Erdman's books  for mechanism synthesis.	1999-03-19
