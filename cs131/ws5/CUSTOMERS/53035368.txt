The first was the previous Planetary volume. In this one, aside from crafting a tale of espinoge and intrigue that reads like the X-files meet the X-men, Ellis continues to reinturrpet pop culture archetypes. Here he brings in analogues to John Constantine, James Bond, Marilyn Monroe, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and even Morpheus from the Matrix. Even more than that he explores and developes these ideas and uses them to create a strange and compelling universe.<BR>   If I have one complaint, it's that Ellis doesn't get into the psyches and background of the characters as much as I'd like to see. We do get into the territory by the end of the book, though,	2004-05-25

The basic idea of Ender's Game could have easily gone wrong. It could have turned into juvenilistic wish full-filment fantasy or yet another innocent child has horrible things done to him story.<BR> But Card escapes all that by making Ender a figure that is heroic in the classical sense (i.e. unconstrainable by normal society), yet tragic in a very modern sense. He is a far from helpless child and it is his very genius that causes his tragedy.<BR>Yeah, he saves the world in the end, but it is a morally ambiguous victory at best.<BR> The style is simplistic, but that is fitting for Ender's viewpoint and the militeristic background. It grows more complex alongside Ender.	2003-09-12

The story is about the stuggle of Ulric Von Bek against the Nazi's. Elric plays a significant part here, but this is only partially his story. The story moves slower than most of Moorcock's works. While some people find this a fault, to me it adds more versimultitude than his previous books. Ulric and Elric are interesting in their similarities and differences. Ulric while sharing Elric's albinoism and brooding nature, is still the production of a more civilized era. If you are looking for a simple retread of the previous Elric books, don't look here, but if you want a novel that takes the Multiverse and expands on it you will enjoy this.	2003-04-19

He is also an excelent plotter. However this is one of his minor works. There is much to enjoy here. It has a lot of action and Zelazny is willing to play with language, narration, and even font to good effect. The major weakness to this is in the characters. Fred Cassidy is an interesting character albeit a typical one for Zelazny. The other characters, however, are weak and a poorly realized. If you want to read this book by all means do, but I would suggest instead you read &quot;This Immortal&quot; or &quot;Lord of Light&quot;.	2003-03-20

Lovecraft is one of those writers you either love or hate. Some of it is just personal preference. For example, Lovecraft's prose is a baroque and complex. It is generally evocative but at times clumsy, but always suited to the story. If you prefer a more Hemingwayesque style then look elsewhere. If you don't like weird and scary works don't bother. However if you lack these prejudices then you might be interest. Lovecraft does have his faults though, his racism sometimes enters into the story as in \\"He\\". Also his fiction can range from the truely [bad] such as \\"Herbert West-Re-animator\\" to the astoundingly good such as \\"The Colour out of Space\\" and \\"Shadow over Innsmouth.\\" It is foolish to present his fiction as flawless. However, it is even more foolish to ignore it.	2003-03-15

They all involve an unnamed protagonist who has no record of his existence. The first one, \\"The Eve of Rumoko\\" is an entertaining suspense story which introduces us to the hero and gives us a thrilling plot without sacrficing style or depth of character. The second, \\"Kjawlll'kje'k'koothai'lll'kjr'k,\\" is by far the weakest of the stories a not very intriguing mystery not really comparable to the other two. However \\"Home is the Hangman,\\" the third story is excellent despite it's B-moviesh plot (killer robot from outer space).

The labrynthine library is a symbol of the world, filled with knowledge but nearly uncomprehendable in whole.

It has witches, ghost, creepy castle, brooding atmosphere, and plenty of blood.

The story itself<BR>is compelling, but the writing is also great. This isn't a dumb-downed John Grisham-type popular novel, nor an overly pretentious John Updike &quot;literary&quot; story. The voice of Scout is perfect and it is very rare to see a child portrayed rightly. Unlike other books, the children are neither adults in small bodies nor treated as human larvae unable to understand the world. The things that Scout doesn't understand are the things about this world that don't make sense: racism and injustice. This is one of the handful of books that are close to perfection.	2001-11-26

Using a mythical bus trip from Hell to Heaven, he shows what humans have to sacrifice on the way to Heaven. While, some say Lewis is a bit cold in this book, I disagree. Lewis merely shows that even the best virtuals can be twisted into vices. Like men who kill innocents in the name of God, or the stalker who terroizes the one he &quot;loves&quot;.

Of course, they all have to do with dragons, but several fall in the Hero goes to slay Dragon formula. The Orson Scott Card does not seem to fit in the traditional dragon formula and is the outstanding story. The Anne MaCaffrey is good but overwritten at points. I expected more from the Zelazny. It was very good, but Zelazny has done such mind-blowing work that this seems to be a bit trite. The Friesner is hillarious and the best of the funny stories in this book.

He is a torturer but no more a sadist than anyone else. He has many contradicting elements, but so do real people. The writing is baroque, sonoral, and wise. There are many quotes from the Series that are absolutely breath-taking. The plot doesn't seem to be there at first, but it is plotted like a Gene Wolfe novel where simple clues are all over the place.

Like Dune it tells a mythic story in a distant and almost alien future. Unlike Dune, these books are written in a fluid, baroque, and harmonic prose. Also the characters aren't just vague archetypes but real humans. Wolfe's skill in characterization is equal to Tolstoy or Dickens or Peake or Dostoevsky (ok, maybe not equal to Dostoevsky, but close). Severian is one of the greatest (and probably the most contraditory) characters in Literature. There are allusions to myths and the Bible. Several subversions of narration are used. Plenty of deeply philosophical ponderings and metaphorical incidents. Plus a couple of really cool action scenes.	2001-01-17

He rufeses to believe in all the wonderful things that are around him. He also doesn't believe in the people. He is bitter and spiteful, yet Donaldson does not over do this. The book also wrestles with interesting themes: nature of reality, cruelity of the world, man's cruelity to others, etc. The themes could have been delved into more deeply but this isn't Philip K. Dick.  The major problem with this book is that the world and events around Covenant I've already seen in other fantasies. The feel of &quot;the Land&quot; is a bit too Tolkienesque and so are the events in the story (Lord Foul/Sauron, Sauron/Lord Foul). Maybe, I shouldn't have read this after finishing Jeffery Ford's &quot;Memorandum&quot;, which breaks away from the traditional fantasy world.	2000-12-17
US	53035368	REVSP6DS17BRW	0380793326	678851862	The Physiognomy	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Weird and Wonderful	After I had finished reading this novel, I ran across it again, of all places, in a supermarket. Why on earth was it there? It is not a national bestseller and is weird, non-conventional, and literate. It is the type of book, like the Gormenghast Trilogy, that is absolutely wonderful but not likely to become a favorite of the masses (at least not right away).  Most of the complaints about the book is that Ford didn't write it the way someone else would. One of the reviewers here said as much because he/she thought it was stupid that Ford had Cley loose his ability to read the Physiognomy, simply because it was not what he/she would happen. Also, in his review column in Asimov's, Norman Spinrad complains about Cley going through a moral epiphany and becomes a &quot;conventional&quot; hero. While, I think that the turn around was to sudden and wish that Cley's acid wit did not dissapear and this kept me from giving it five stars, I think they are minor flaws. Plus, Cley's wit does not dissapear completely and is somewhat more prominent in Memoranda than the later part of the book.	2000-12-03

He is however primarily a adventure writer.  &quot;Abercrombie Station&quot; and &quot;Cholwell's Chickens&quot; are both about the  adventures of Jean Parlier. The former (weaker of the two) tells how she  becomes rich, the latter how she finds her long lost and quite strange  family.  &quot;Chateau D'If&quot; the title story of the collection and  name of an imaginary business that sells adventure. Vance does good job  reworking an old trope in this one making it one of the strongest stories  in the collection.  My personal favorite is &quot;The Gift of Gab&quot;  which turns the table on business of fishing. The greatest strength of this  story is Vance's ability to create a sentient alien race with no form of  communication and the consequences of its contact with humanity.  The final  story is &quot;Rumfuddle&quot;, which is part exploration of what would  happen if worm holes became as common as microchips. It is also a study of  the nature of evil. The way these two apparently unrelated ideas are  related makes an interesting and unusual story.	2000-07-04

This book made me snicker at times, but I didn't really laugh. I think it is in Vonnegut's delivery, the scenes are not visual enough. This, ironicaly,  works well with the tragic elements though. The only other problem is there  is no sense of closer because of the fragmented style, but this same style  works very well when you are in the middle of the book. If you like this,  I'd think you'd also like Canticle for Leibowits by Walter Miller. It is   somewhat more optimistic, but just as poignant.	2000-06-26

The only thing  that links them is the planet Mars and the themes that run through out  Bradbury's entire body of work.

Hear we have probably one of the most effecting horror novels ever written. What makes Bradbury so powerful a writer. It's not just the simple, yet lyrical, prose, but how every word  seems to pulse with the theme of his stories. Bradbury is a master  fanticist, who, like Gene Wolfe or Harlan Ellison, has written an large  amount of stories in various genres (SF, Horror, even mainstream) yet alway  maintaining the same style and texture. Any one who loves good writting  should at least read this, The Martian Chronicles, and Fahrenheit 451.	2000-06-21

As I said before, I found myself  more fascinated with the Ringworld itself than with any of the characters,  it is fully envision with depth and imagination.

He desires to be home with the people he loves but  the person he love's most, Fuchsia his sister, is dead and he loathes the  mind numbing ritual and arbitary laws of Gormenghast. As he travels out he  finds oppression everywhere, a police force that holds terror in the  population of the unnamed land he visits, a thug who tortures and oppresses  a refuge woman. Titus makes and looses friends, enemies, and lovers. His  sanity is questioned (Peake was falling pray to hereditary insanity when he  wrote this). After much pain and grief, he finally comes to terms with  himself and his heritage and finds independence. This is the story of  Titus's growth to manhood.

Instead I'd like to mention despite everything that happens this  is merely Act 1 of the play. It set's up the world in which Titus is born  the events that will shape his soul even while he is an infant. It gives us  something that no other book (play, movie, etc) does.

I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been  borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is  somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical  transmutation). This  book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to  understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect  Star Wars style entertaiment.	1999-01-05

Much has come true. I mean how many people think &quot;Titanic&quot; actually qualifies as entertainment. He described a  society were simplistic plots dominated. He also described a presidential  race won because of one canidates charisma not because of wether or not his  plans would work. Most of all Grandmaster Bradbury gives us hope. I  sincerely believe that TV and movies will become obsolete to holograms and  VR. Holograms and VR will become obsolete to somatic input devices.  Nevertheless books will always be read. Why? I'm sixteen and proof that  love of literature hasn't been completely lost on my generation. These are  a few of the reasons this is one of my favorite books.	1998-12-30

It hits you in the heart. This book is definetly one of the greatest works of all time. The prose is beautiful. It has a definite sense of wonder. It explores the depths of the  human soul.	1998-12-30

It has also more action. It also has magic in it the other books lacked it. Lawhead's style has always been heavy on sword and light on sorcery. Which is quite refreshing. Also  his heros always use sword (Merlin was a prophet and miracle-worker) and  his villians sorcery. This book has his characters battling the undead  (which alot of his books has). Only that it is three men against a legion  of undead.	1998-12-28

I don't mind him being a Christian since I am one  too. This book takes us from his youth to his elder years. The great thing  about the trilogy is that Merlin stays young forever. So he really is  immortal (okay, you can kill him but aside from that)&gt;	1998-12-28

My second choice would be Earthsea. In this book Le Guin has created a vivid world that is easy the second best world in all fantasy.  Tolkien is the Archmage. She is the second in command.	1998-12-28

Having fallen in love with Lawhead's Dragon King Trilogy, I bought all four books in the series (Taliesin, Merlin, Arthur, and Pendragon. Grail was not yet out). This book has one major flaw, the strange placement of  the legends of Atlantis in with Arthurian and Celtic myths. The other books  in the series wisely ignore much of this.	1998-12-28

(Landover)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Better than Glory Road	I actually thought this book is better than Robert Heinlein's Glory Road, which had a similar premise. While the Heinlein book had it's virtues, frankly it let down. This book does not. Brooks has created a detailed  world. There is many elements to the story. I loved the concept of dragons  originally being menaced by humans. Then turning bad in their hatred.	1998-12-28

It has some of the best action scenes I've ever read. It is very humorous. Most of all the three protagonists (Oscar, Star, and Rufo) are all intresting and very likable.  Problem is the plot ends in the third quarter and the book looses track of  it self.	1998-12-27

He believed it just not to the extreme taken in the book. What he was trying to say was simply: Patriotism is good, self-sacrifice is good, actually punishing  criminals is good. I would like to add that I would rather live in this  world then the politically correct one the liberals (far left liberals, not  the average inteligent person who considers himself liberal)would create	1998-12-27
