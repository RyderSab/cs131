The book is not a radical environmental one where humans must go back to tribal living, but a very thought out and even carrying book.  It belongs on the shelf of humanistic and transpersonal students as well as integral philosophers.  The only bad thing about the book is that it is so unknown.	2004-12-06

It consists of over 60 essays as well as a DVD with interviews.  The book is partially directed at Ken Wilber's concept of integral medicine.  Wilber is not a medical authority but an integral philosopher with many novel and important views.  He considers integral medicine as a perspective that includes the patient's subjective world space (one's meaning, values, and world view), the patient's social relationships (shared meaning, values and aspirations) as well as the patient's physical condition (the focus of most Western medicine).  Those of us who work in the field (mine clinical trials) will appreciate this expanded view.  Ironically, each of the essayists to a large degree focus on only one of these three areas of existence.  But then this is not a bad thing for each of these authors has something to contribute.  It would probably be best to view Wilber's contribution, the Foreward, as a theoretical attempt to expand the concept of medicine.  There are other contributors who are transpersonal and humanistic psychologists and provide a theoretical orientation adding much visionary value to this book.  There are also a number of practicing clinicians who anchor the book with suggestions grounded in evidence based medicine. These include Michael Samuels, Dean Ornish, Rachel Remen, Deepak Chopra, and Larry Dosey, all both experienced clinicians and visionaries.  Other outstanding researchers' essays included in this book are by Candace Pert, Jon Kabat-Zinn, David Levin, and Stephanie Simonton-Atchley.  This book offers the researcher, the clinician, and the patient much material to take and from it, synthesize their own view in the crucible of life.<br /><br />Daryl S Paulson Ph.

This book describes Ken Wilber's philosophy and his books to date in very clear terms.  He has done Wilber an incredible favor in not straying from Wilber's path and carefully summarizing each of his books.  Reynolds is a very clear writer who may have something to say beyond an interpreter for Wilber.  It would be nice in the future to hear Reynolds view of the world.    The only negative of the book is the cheap paper it is printed on--newspaper grade.  This book should have been printed in hardcover or at least a durable paper.	2004-11-28

Wilber has provided the most comprehensive transpersonal and now integral philosophic theory ever presented.  The transpersonal and integral movements are very much in his debt.  Yet as C.G. Jung said, the brighter the light the darker the shadow and this applies to Wilber.  While his theories are grand, his and his criticisms of others bold even insulting, he has world renouned thin skin.  That is, he can not tolerate criticism.  Natually then this book has not agreed well with him.  But as critics say to their frustration, Wilber avoids answering criticisms by 1) ignoring them, 2)responding to what has not been criticized, 3)referring them to one of his works that has not been published, 4) referring them to one of his works that does not answer the criticism, 5)claiming the works criticized were from a different Wilber era (eg. Wilber 1,2,3,4,5)and then not address the issue, or 6)claiming critics did not read him correctly.  Getting a straight answer from Wilber, as some have said, is like clasping soap in a bath tub with greasy hands.  Yet in Wilber's defense, some of the works presented in this book clearly do not credit him where credit is due, or find some small item he did not include in his theory and therefore reject his entire theory collection.  Whether you like and appreciate Wilber's work or not, this collection of writings is very informative and does point out that even Wilber's theories have holes.	2004-06-19

He aligns his core thoughts along the thoughts of Ken Wilber.  This how ever is not Wilberian book and has many original insights, not mere theory.  Grof is a gifted psychiatrist with no axe to grind.  He, unlike Wilber who believes his theories hold and explain everyone else's theories, is much more open and unthreatened.  He brings different viewpoints to his writing, without claiming to be the end all or have the last word.  Get this book, you will not be let down.	2004-06-19

She essentially presented integral psychology with this book in that it integrates body, emotions, mind and spirit.  She uses many of the concepts of Ken Wilber's earlier works, but unlike him, she is not merely a theorist.  She has been a psychotherapist for many years, and allows the reader to choose for themselves what is true.  Refreshingly, she does not have an agenda like so many writers, except for one to discover who they are at a deep level in their own way.  This book is probably the best applied book in transpersonal and integral psychology available.  If you have to own only one book, this is that book.	2004-06-19

He presents his theories as well as his personality.  Wilber is one of the most insightful spiritually based theorists, and has developed a very interesting model or rather models.  The only negatives of the series are his laugh which is irritating at best and his constant joking about himself being crazed.  Be much better if he could find his own voice, but then maybe this is the real Wilber.  You decide.  Definitely worth the money.	2004-05-25

While much of the work is similar to Ken Wilber's at least in structure, this book in many ways transcends Wilber's works with some real original thinking.  Not surprisingly, the author is an authority on integral thought without trying to parrot Ken Wilber's view.

One the real Ken Wilber is better known by the reader and two it is packed with timely criticisms concerning the baby boomer generation and postmodernity.  While it is written in novel form, and at a surface level appears to be life 101 with some college kids, at a deeper level, one that is usually neglected, this work is pure gold.  Gold that can be used right now in one's life as they confront the world.  Wilber is probably the most authentic philosopher practicing and pays homage to no one or thing except what he understands to be true.  Not many writers do this with honestly and none with the originality of Wilber.	2004-05-20

The two books in this volumn were written in the 1970s and represent the first two books by Wilber.  It was the launch of these books that transpersonal psychology had a real focus.

Wilber's ability to integrate vast amounts of information in a way that makes sense is incredible.  He is also one of the clearest writers you will ever read. I find that reading Wilber also requires that one read many of the references he cites to really understand where he is coming from. Absolutely a must book.	2003-12-19
