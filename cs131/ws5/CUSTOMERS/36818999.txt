He played on the dynastic New York Yankees teams of the 1920s and 1930s alongside Babe Ruth. He had a .340 lifetime batting average and 493 career home runs. He set a record of 2,130 consecutive games played, a record that stood for decades. And he died of ALS in 1941 at age 38, a disease that now bears his name in the recollections of most Americans. His story, with proper dramatic license, was portrayed in the classic baseball movie, \\"The Pride of the Yankees,\\" with Gary Cooper as Gehrig in what many consider the actor's greatest performance.<br /><br />Ray Robinson, a sports journalist and editor, tells this story in \\"Iron Horse: Lou Gehrig and His Time.\\" It is a book very much in the genre of many other conventional sports biographies. It is a serviceable biography at best, and far from great. In it we learn about one of the greatest stars of major league baseball in the pre-World War II era. If you want a basic introduction to the life and career of Lou Gehrig this book is fine. If you want a well-researched, thoughtful, and sophisticated biography of the Yankee great go elsewhere. This work is very much a \\"once over lightly\\" treatment of a person who deserves better.	2005-10-08

A self¬styled enforcer for the church, his career is deserving of a high-caliber biography. Unfortunately, \\"`Wild Bill' Hickman and the Mormon Frontier\\" is not of high caliber.<br /><br />Bill Hickman grew up in Missouri and in 1838 affiliated with the Mormon church, quickly becoming a member of the Danite vigilante group that terrorized dissidents. Migrating to Utah, Hickman continued his violent lifestyle, where his activities included, among others, guerilla operations in the 1857-1858 Mormon War. Hickman admitted to the murders of several people, suggesting that he had been taking orders from Brigham Young. When his activities became embarrassing to the church, Hickman engaged in a game of power politics, playing Mormon and government officials against each other. He was successful for a time, but his violence eventually made him persona non grata in both camps. In 1872 he published an expose, \\"Brigham's Destroying Angel,\\" which implicated the Mormon leadership in his misdeeds. Hickman finally died in 1883 in obscurity near Lander, Wyoming.<br /><br />Hilton's book has several problems. As one example, there is a disturbing lack of documentation. She declares in the preface that footnotes \\"can be distracting,\\" and that she \\"instead tried to provide enough information within the text to allow the reader to locate the appropriate reference in the bibliography\\" (p. xi). Unfortunately, locating sources is nearly impossible in many cases, especially in instances where it would be most useful.<br /><br />The author also fails to organize the work into a coherent form. For instance, in a chapter entitled \\"The RLDS in Utah,\\" less than a full page is devoted to that subject, and the remainder is concerned with other Hickman activities not related to the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.<br /><br />But these are minor difficulties compared to central questions left perplexingly unexplored. Hilton's inability to deal with the difficult issue of what was fact and what was fancy in \\"Brigham's Destroying Angel,\\" despite a promise to do so in the preface, was disappointing. Was it written out of spite? What basis in fact did it have? Additionally, and it is fundamental to considering the career of Hickman, what was his relationship to Brigham Young? Young was clearly aware of Hickman's lawlessness but still used him to carry out dangerous assignments, until Hickman's reputation became so colored that it significantly hurt the church. Hilton does not know or does not care about Young's role in murders and other felonies apparently committed by Hickman. Did Hickman carry out his activities at the direction of the church? The work is unclear on such crucial questions.<br /><br />\\"`Wild Bill' Hickman and the Mormon Frontier\\" is a mildly interesting book, but a full understanding of this man's career awaits additional work. Hickman remains a subject in need of a good critical biography.ored.

The \\"new Mormon history,\\" as this field was labeled in the 1970s, was at first envisioned as an historiographical trend aimed at freeing the study of the faith from the apologetics of previous eras. For many reasons this approach to Mormon history has failed in recent years and this book exemplifies both the heady freshness of the \\"new Mormon history\\" during its first years and its more recent, disappointing reality.<br /><br />\\"The Millenarian World of Early Mormonism,\\" written by Brigham Young University professor Grant Underwood, is an able explanation of the place of the early Mormon religion of the 1830s and 1840s within the larger Christian apocalyptic movement. Exhaustively researched and tenaciously argued, Underwood's book presents early Mormonism as being more closely related to a larger millenarian perspective than most Latter-day Saints have thought, then or now. By illuminating the parallels between Mormon millennial thought and apocalyptic ideas present in other denominations Underwood demonstrates that Joseph Smith Jr. reflected the society in which he lived and perhaps borrowed from it in creating his unique religious tradition. It was a relatively short step, Underwood confirms, from broader millenarianism to that expressed by the Mormons. Such a conclusion says much about the genius of Joseph Smith as a consolidator and explicator of ideas floating in the religious ether of the early republic, if not as a prophet receiving God's will from on high.<br /><br />A subtle but vital aspect of Underwood's book is his downplaying of the revolutionary tendencies of Mormonism in general and its millennialism in particular. He suggests that Mormon converts of the 1830s had much in common with other members of American society, and were not insurrectionists seeking to remake it. He asserts that they were \\"moderate millenarians whose critique of society focused primarily on its spiritual rather than structural deficiencies\\" (108). This flies in the face of what most other historians have said about the early Latter-day Saints. It also belies what the early Mormons believed about themselves, and cannot be sustained when confronted with the radical nature of early Mormonism.<br /><br />One example among many makes this point. In 1832 Joseph Smith gave his famous prophecy on the American Civil War. Canonized by the Mormon church, it has been long used as a missionary tool to show that Smith was a \\"true prophet,\\" since he predicted that a rebellion would begin in South Carolina, southern states would fight northern ones, slaves would rise up against masters, and a great war would take place. What Mormons do not emphasize about this prediction, and which contradict Underwood's moderate millennial argument, is Smith's belief that this would be the beginning of a general Armageddon in which God would make \\"a full end of all nations\\" and from which would emerge \\"the day of the Lord,\\" the millennial reign of God's small group of righteous Saints (Doctrine and Covenants, section 87). By seeking to submerge the militant nature of early Mormonism Underwood might be helping to make respectable the image of present-day Mormonism, but he does not enhance historical understanding.<br /><br />Underwood's work is firmly in the tradition of the \\"new Mormon history,\\" relying on detailed research in documents and a presentation that never questions the underlying assumptions of the Mormon faith. It does so admirably, and in so doing presents challenges to students seeking to understand the development of early Mormonism.ose critique of society focused primarily on its spiritual rather than structural deficiencies\\" (108).

Frontiersman, fur trader, mountain man, guide, scout, Indian agent, and soldier were all appropriate descriptive terms for Carson. But the authors of this biography would attach the term \\"hero\\" to Carson as well. \\"He was and has remained one of America's most widely known and most deserving heroes,\\" the authors assert (p. xi). Although there is a feeling of encountering a sacred relic, Guild's and Carter's \\"Kit Carson\\" is a fine biography. It is scholarly, well-organized, admirably documented, and certainly the most authoritative biography of Carson to appear by the 1980s.<br /><br />There is also a touch of humor in the wry way in which the authors describe certain incidents. In a description of Carson's sojourn as a mountain man Guild and Carter noted: \\"When the trapper were not hunting meat, feeding their horses cottonwood bark, cleaning their guns, mending saddles or bridles, sharpening knives or axes, building corrals or forts, or doing whatever other tasks they felt desirable or necessary, they did as they pleased\\" (p. 51). The humor of this statement is obvious. Could they have done otherwise? Certainly Guild's and Carter's \\"Kit Carson will find a place as a benchmark in the historiography of the subject for years.<br /><br />The authors take a standard approach toward their subject, organizing the material chronologically. They do not discount the years Kit Carson spent in the mountains learning its lore during the l820s and l830s, but they greatly emphasize the role he played later as guide and scout for John C. Fremont and as an expert on the Indian affairs of the Southwest. They credit Carson with much of the success of Fremont's expeditions during the mid-1840s, a recognition that seems apparent to most observers. They also commend Carson's actions as an advisor and guide for the Army during the Indian war of 1854-1855 and as commander of the difficult campaign against Navaho warriors in 1863-1864. Guild and Carter observe that Carson, although no friend of Indians, respected and in certain ways admired them. Always, they assert, he stood for just and reasonable relations between the two societies.commander of the difficult campaign against Navaho warriors in 1863-1864.

They permit a wealth of information to be depicted on each page and the maps included in them have the ability to communicate not only stark spatial features but also a wide range of other types of historical detail. Francis Paul Prucha's \\"Atlas of American Indian Affairs\\" is a most welcome addition to this aspect of historical study. Long a leading historian of the Indian experience in America, Prucha now captures with great comprehension the spatial dimensions of both the historical and contemporary events of Native Americans.<br /><br />This atlas consists of 109 maps divided into ten individual sections and presented chronologically. Collectively they illustrate quite well the westward movement of the Indian frontier in the nineteenth century and the continued importance of Indian ethnicity in the Twentieth. There are maps relating to tribal lands and culture areas, census information, land cessions, reservations, the Indian experience in different regions of America, the Indian wars, and cultural aspects such as Indian agency locations, Indian schools, and Indian hospitals. Prucha has kept the narrative in this book to a minimum--including only a short preface, introductory statement to each of the ten major sections, and an outstanding explanation of themes in explanatory references at the end of the book. The philosophy that less is more paid off in this book as the individual maps are generally quite easy to understand and pack a wealth of information. For example, I was especially interested to follow chronologically Indian population statistics as compiled in the census from 1890 through 1980, as well as urban Indian populations between 1960 and 1980. The growth and diffusion of American Indians throughout the continental United States during the period since World War II was especially intriguing.<br /><br />For all that such a capable work as this has to recommend it, maps intrinsically have limitations. Only so much information can be displayed both in any given map and in any atlas. The question of what topics to cover, the amount of data to include, and how best to display it for ready interpretation are challenging issues. Overall, Prucha has done a commendable job of this.trinsically have limitations. Only so much information can be displayed both in any given map and in any atlas.

This work presents the Berlin Blockade as a titanic struggle between two blocks of nations with divergent ideologies that nearly plunged the world into another major war.<br /><br />\\"Airbridge to Berlin\\" is designed exclusively as popular history, and does a fine job of offering a valuable reinterpretation of the event. Authors Giangreco and Griffin have succeeded admirably in presenting a graphic depiction of the airlift, this time from a decidedly American perspective. Their narrative concentrates on a description of the events of the airlift itself, the diplomatic story of its resolution, and a brief history of the city since 1949. They assert that no other city has been the center of East/West controversy as has Berlin in the post-World War II period. The blockade and airlift, Giangreco and Griffin suggest, was only one of several crises involving the city, and these confrontations will not abate until the unique situation of a divided Berlin is resolved. The most important contribution of \\"Airbridge to Berlin,\\" however, is the more than 300 black and white photographs that illustrate the volume. Many have never been published before, and they depict well the trials and hopes of the people of Berlin during the blockade. The photographs put an entirely new face on the events of the Berlin Airlift and are alone worth the price of the volume.	2005-10-02

His efforts eventually brought his cashiering for insubordination in 1925. Virtually unknown to later generations, but ultimately more important for Air Force independence, was Mason Patrick, who served as Army Air Service chief of staff through much of the 1920s. \\"Mason Patrick and the Fight for Air Service Independence\\" tells the story of how Patrick worked quietly through the 1920s to prove the worth of air power.<br /><br />This fine book tells the story of Mason Patrick from his birth during the American Civil War to a Confederate surgeon. Patrick became a career army officer after graduating second in his West Point class in 1886, numbering among his classmates John J. Pershing. He rose through the army's ranks and in 1918 Pershing appointed him head of the Army Air Service. With dissention between air officers and the rest of the service running high, in no small part because of Billy Mitchell, Patrick worked to smooth relations, to ensure the continued capability of the Air Service, and to position it to eventually become a separate service. That independence came in 1947, long after Patrick had retired and passed on, but his role in paving the way was central to the move. Indeed, Patrick crafted the Army Air Corps Act of 1926 that established the Army Air Corps as a part of the service equal to the Corp of Engineers or any other critical component.<br /><br />He also pursued the development of strategic bombardment, supported by pursuit operations, that found fruition in World War II. Since this mission did not require close coordination with ground forces, Patrick believed there was no reason it had to be part of the army. This theory became the backbone of the Air Corps' campaign for an independent Department of the Air Force. This very fine book chronicles the place of Mason Patrick in this quest for independence. It is a valuable addition to the literature on the history of the Air Force.place of Mason Patrick in this quest for independence.

The fortieth anniversary of the Berlin Airlift in 1988 was no exception. Ann and John Tusa's \\"The Berlin Airlift\\" was one of many publications about the episode originally appearing as a result of that anniversary. It asserts that the Berlin Blockade represented a titanic struggle between two blocks of nations with divergent ideologies that nearly plunged the world into another major war. More important, however, it concentrates on the intensely human experience of the crisis, describing the problems and successes of the personalities involved. Throughout, in words and pictures, it creates vivid images of the crisis for a largely popular audience.<br /><br />The blockade of Berlin marked the first direct confrontation between the West and the Soviet Union in the post-World War II era. The United States, France, and the United Kingdom responded to the Soviet siege with an ingenious means of maintaining the allied presence in a city cut-off from the rest of Western Europe without provoking combat. American and British fliers operated a complex shuttle service between western Germany and Berlin for some fifteen months between June 1948 and September 1949, hauling more than 2.3 million tons of supplies to the better than two million inhabitants of Berlin. This sustenance allowed the western allies to maintain their presence and influence in the city, if only by their fingernails, while diplomats worked on a settlement.<br /><br />Ann and John Tusas' book presents the events of the Berlin blockade and airlift as an epic struggle between nations. Written from a decidedly British viewpoint--John Tusa is a journalist with the BBC-\\"The Berlin Airlift\\" contains a rousing story of individual heroism and high drama. It reads like a classic western, with good guys (the western allies) and bad guys (the Soviets and communist Germans), and anecdotes about how these two forces clashed. Like any good western, the ending was predictable as the Americans and their allies ultimately defeated the Soviets.<br /><br />\\"The Berlin Airlift\\" will be of more interest to non-specialist readers than to students of Berlin Airlift historiography, although those knowledgeable about many aspects of the crisis will still benefit from the Tusas' descriptions of the British contributions to the airlift. The authors thoroughly researched British records and analyzed that aspect of the story, a particular area that has been slighted in previous studies of the crisis, and they present their findings better and with more verve than any earlier work. The position of the British government in the crisis; the development, organization, and, operation of the British task force flying airlift missions; and the British role in negotiating the lifting of the blockade are well documented in \\"The Berlin Airlift.\\"<br /><br />There are, however, several flaws which make \\"The Berlin Airlift\\" less useful than I would have liked. First, the authors take more than 150 out of a total of 379 pages of text to get to the actual blockade of Berlin. While this prefatory material deals with the Berlin question and general relations between the two power blocks that confronted each other at Berlin in 1948-1949, it seems excessive when measured against the size of the whole book. I would have anticipated a more expeditious handling of earlier foreign relations and a greater emphasis on the airlift itself. Second, no clear picture of the American side of the airlift can be gained from reading the Tusas' book. The organization of the 1st Berlin Airlift Task Force, the agent managing the American effort, receives short shrift; as does the unique operational approach developed to order airlift flow. Almost nothing about Major General William H. Tunner, the American commander who more than anyone understood the possibilities and especially the limitations of airlift and organized the operation for the success it achieved during the winter of 1948-1949, is included in \\"The Berlin Airlift.\\" Brigadier General Joseph Smith, who initially commanded the Airlift Task Force and oversaw the early success of the operation, is not even mentioned. The Tusas offer no discussion of any sophistication about the pattern of operations, the nature of logistics and maintenance, command and control, force structure, and C-54 acquisition from outside of Europe to augment the airlift fleet. From an operational perspective, this books discussion of the American airlift effort is at best superficial. Indeed, the book should have been retitled to indicate that it dealt largely with the British aspects of the airlift.<br /><br />Finally, the scholarly apparatus of this book, while present, proves next to useless. A mere five pages of bibliography, omitting some of the most interesting and useful works on the subject, were used as the basic references for the book. Even worse, the chapter notes are especially confusing because they have no page numbers for any published sources. Since the majority of the references are for published works this shortcoming is particularly troublesome. No one will be able to reconstruct the thought processes of the authors as they review the text, and I must ask, was that the intent in omitting them? To the credit of the Tusas, however, they have mined the Public Records Office in the United Kingdom and have, as their chapter notes demonstrate, offered several new insights relative to British participation in the airlift based upon these records.<br /><br />\\"The Berlin Airlift\\" certainly has its strengths and weaknesses. It will not replace W.

James P. Ronda, well respected for his work on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, presents in this book the first full-length study of Astoria to appear since Washington Irving's \\"Astoria\\" in 1836. The result is a fine work that is more significant than just a story of adventure in the Pacific Northwest or just one more account of a single aspect of the fur trade. It moves with a sweep and a dimension that places the little post on the banks of the Columbia River in the vortex of world events, a pawn in games of international rivalry and chance.<br /><br />Ronda describes carefully the efforts of John Jacob Astor, head of the Pacific Fur Company and several other business enterprises, to establish Astoria as the capital of his far western trading empire during the first decade of the nineteenth century. That effort moved from New York to Washington to St. Petersburg to Montreal to Canton as he manipulated international politics and appealed to personal desires. Astor, motivated by a quest for wealth but fortified by a sense of national prominence, appealed to the expansionist-minded politicians of the United States to gain support for Astoria's creation. He was finally successful and in 1811 the site was settled by representatives of the Pacific Fur Company traveling in two contingents, one overland and the other by sea. For the next three years Astor and his lieutenants battled bureaucracy in several nations, international ambitions on the part of several countries, rival fur trading companies, and the economics of the business to keep Astoria in operation. They failed, and it succumbed during the War of 1812 only to become one of the British North West Company's posts for the next twenty years.<br /><br />But \\"Astoria & Emoire\\" is more than a recitation of the life and death of the American settlement. Although it is little more than a footnote in most history texts, if Ronda had limited his book to the Astoria's history irrespective of other events that affected it I would have questioned the necessity of its publication. Instead, Ronda provides an excellent study in the history of international relations at several levels of governments and between private citizens. Astoria is, essentially, a case study in business and politics in an international setting. Ronda's work, moreover, is a social history. He uses some untapped historical materials to reconstruct life on the trips to and from Astoria as well as activities at the post. In so doing, he presents a very useful portrait of activities in an early fur trading establishment. He describes something of the interrelationships of cultures and allegiances between the Americans, the Indians, the French and British Canadians, the Russians, and the Hawaiians. This social portrait is especially welcome also as a glimpse of the diversity present on the early fur trading frontier.<br /><br />\\"Astoria & Emoire\\" is one of several refreshing books to appear on the development of the American West. It is a commendable work, and because of the skill of its author its 344 pages of narrative make interesting reading. One word of caution, however, this is not just western or frontier history, it is sophisticated analysis of several historical trends focused through the lens of Astoria; present in it also is social history and business history and diplomatic history and probably some other types of history yet unnamed. Those seeking staid fur trade literature with the emphasis on minutiae will be disappointed. Those readers pondering broader vistas, however, will be rewarded by considering Ronda's work.e life and death of the American settlement. Although it is little more than a footnote in most history texts, if Ronda had limited his book to the Astoria's history irrespective of other events that affected it I would have questioned the necessity of its publication. Instead, Ronda provides an excellent study in the history of international relations at several levels of governments and between private citizens. Astoria is, essentially, a case study in business and politics in an international setting. Ronda's work, moreover, is a social history. He uses some untapped historical materials to reconstruct life on the trips to and from Astoria as well as activities at the post. In so doing, he presents a very useful portrait of activities in an early fur trading establishment. He describes something of the interrelationships of cultures and allegiances between the Americans, the Indians, the French and British Canadians, the Russians, and the Hawaiians. This social portrait is especially welcome also as a glimpse of the diversity present on the early fur trading frontier.  <br /> <br />\\"Astoria & Emoire\\" is one of several refreshing books to appear on the development of the American West. It is a commendable work, and because of the skill of its author its 344 pages of narrative make interesting reading.

The fourteen biographies in this collection emphasize the wide diversity of men who served first as combat officers, but also as scientists, writers, explorers, engineers, or administrators depending upon their talents and interests. Each made a unique contribution, which has been ably captured in these biographical sketches.<br /><br />The introductory essay, \\"The Frontier and the American Military Experience,\\" a revision of Robert M. Utley's Harmon Memorial Lecture at the United States Air Force Academy in 1976, remains a challenging analysis of the centrality of the army's experience on the frontier more than a decade later. Following this overview, \\"Soldiers West\\" contains excellent biographical sketches of army officers on the nineteenth century frontier. All of the essays are well-researched and invitingly written, but, three sketches in particular caught my fancy, either because they opened quite different territory from the standard or because they concerned individuals who were appealing in a unique way.<br /><br />The first of these is Jerome O. Steffen's discussion of the career of William Clark. Clark, of course, was a volunteer soldier who is the finest example of the Army's interest in trans-Mississippi West exploration. But, Steffen also contends that Clark should be remembered as a transitional figure between volunteer officers of the cis-Mississippi frontier such as William Henry Harrison and Andrew Jackson, men who were basically politicians, and the career soldiers who became the Army's mainstays in the later West.<br /><br />The second essay concerned George A. Custer. Brian W. Dippie begins by asking why this is the case. In examining the Custer legend Dippie notes that the Battle of Little Bighorn, with its images of heroism in the face of overwhelming odds, brought to Custer the lasting fame that success could never have achieved.<br /><br />Finally, Joseph C. Porter offers an exciting and unique portrait of John G. Bourke. Although Bourke never reached a rank higher than captain, he was an outstanding example of the army officer as ethnologist. Throughout the post-bellum period he served in a variety of capacities in the army, but in every case he turned his attention to studying Indian culture. Porter argues persuasively that they were even more important than his more well-known writings on the Indian wars such as \\"The Apache Campaign\\" (1886).<br /><br />\\"Soldier's West\\" is an important, worthwhile collection that offers something for everyone. Like any work of this type it can be criticized for its choices of individuals for inclusion. I would have very much enjoyed seeing the likes of such figures as John C. Fremont, Stephen Watts Kearney, or Philip St. George Cook, each of whom were prominent in the army's frontier experience. Overall, the book is a satisfying and representative collection of army officers who made an imprint on the frontier that became part of the United States.

Established in 1834 to support the fur trade, the fort had become by the 1850s a key post in the U. S. Army's logistical system and an important center for the orderly movement of settlers on the frontier. The troops at the post were involved in most of the major campaigns fought against the Indians of the northern Great Plains, until the post's inactivation in 1890.<br /><br />Paul L. Hedren, superintendent of the Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site here presents an impressive study of the role of Fort Laramie in the Sioux Indian War of 1876-1877, as the episode that broke the back of the Plains Indians. Using Fort Laramie as the backdrop from which to discuss this important episode in American history, Hedren analyzes in lively fashion the Big Horn, Yellowstone, and Powder River expeditions against the Sioux conducted by Gen. George Crook. There is also comment on Custer's defeat at the Little Bighorn, the gold rush into the Black Hills, and the general discord of the Indians at the various agencies.<br /><br />But \\"Fort Laramie in 1876\\" is more than a recitation of the events of the Sioux Indian War. Many other historians have told that story over the years, and if Hedren had limited his book to the war I would have questioned the necessity of its publication. Instead, Hedren recognizes the army post for what it was, the most important installation on the northern plains and the critical site from which the army's campaign against the Sioux was both orchestrated and supplied. While the author's narrative ranges from Omaha, the headquarters ox the army's Department of the Platte, to the campaigns in Montana and the escape of some of the Sioux into Canada. Hedren's focus is always on Fort Laramie and its contributions to the war in terms of personnel, equipment, commanders, communications, and logistics.<br /><br />Hedren is the first to draw on the large body of material relating to the operation ox the post contained in the National Archives, particularly Record Group 393; the extensive collection of primary materials at the U.S. Army Military History Institute, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and documents at the U.S. Military Academy Library at West Point. The result is impressive. Fort Laramie in 1876 captures the essence of the military outpost at war. It is an excellent companion volume and deserves a place on the shelf of all serious students of the American West and the Indian wars.manders, communications, and logistics.  <br /> <br />Hedren is the first to draw on the large body of material relating to the operation ox the post contained in the National Archives, particularly Record Group 393; the extensive collection of primary materials at the U.S. Army Military History Institute, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and documents at the U.S. Military Academy Library at West Point.

De Witt Douglas Kilgore, an English professor at Indiana University, employs the tools of post-modern analysis to pro-space advocacy from David Lasser in the 1920s and 1930s to Robert Zubrin at the end of the twentieth century. He suggests that advocates of spaceflight have long believed that it is human destiny to become a multi-planetary species, but not just as an end in itself but because of the desire to create a utopian society free from the constraints of cultures on Earth. His term for this is \\"astrofuturism,\\" an extension of the American tradition of technological utopianism that has been so much a part of the political upheavals of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Kilgore asserts that the pro-space utopian impulse was founded in the imperial politics and utopian schemes of the nineteenth century, but envisions outer space as an endless frontier that offers solutions to the economic and political problems that dominate the modern world. Its advocates used the conventions of technological and scientific conquest to express the ideals and contradictions endemic to American culture. Astrofuturists, according to Kilgore, imagined space frontiers that could extend the reach of the human species and heal its historical wounds. Their efforts both replicated dominant social presuppositions and supplied the technologies necessary for the critical utopian projects that emerged in the latter twentieth century.<br /><br />Kilgore's scintillating narrative explores how this has played out in the writings of several pro-space advocates. He begins with David Lasser, an American who worked as an editor on two of Hugo Gernsback's science fiction magazines. Lasser wrote \\"The Conquest of Space\\" in 1930, laying out a leftist agenda for societies in space. He later went on to work as a union organizer but never abandoned his commitment to spaceflight as a way in which the oppressed might achieve an egalitarian society. From there Kilgore explores the work of science fiction authors Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and Ben Bova. He also offers an in-depth exploration of the thinking of Princeton University scientist Gerard O'Neill, who excited numerous counterculture refugees in the 1970s with his vision of colonies in space. Finally, Kilgore extends this search for a perfect society to current explanations of colonies on Mars and other planets.<br /><br />Throughout this book Kilgore is concerned with the envisioning of futures that are inherently better in space than what exists on Earth. The novelists that he discusses always display a strong sense of justice, meritocracy, and, at least in the case of Heinlein, not a little libertarianism. A special theme that he investigates in this study is how the astrofuturists dealt with the racism so prevalent in American society, showing that in the science fiction discussed here it is overcome by a belief in the worth of all persons and an acceptance of others based on their capabilities. As Kilgore demonstrates, all of the astrofuturists, whether science fiction writers or not, always posit an open, boundless future for all humanity in space. It would be a place in which justice ruled and all had enough of every necessity of life. Space exploration would bring that, the astrofuturists believed, helping people to live together in greater harmony than ever before by ending the need to compete for resources. Kilgore maintains that this is a very important aspect of a positive future. He insists that \\"It is through this kind of imaginative work that we develop the tools we need to change the future\\" (p. 238).<br /><br />\\"Astrofuturism\\" is a provocative discussion of how we have looked at a positive future in space. Kilgore notes that those involved in promulgating the astrofuturist ideology have emphasized the synergy between human and machines, social concerns and possibilities. Highly recommended.ilgore explores the work of science fiction authors Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and Ben Bova.

US	36818999	R1SXEOWY48MONI	0941214877	160464812	Salamander: The Story of the Mormon Forgery Murders	Books	5	32	35	N	N	Fascinating Account of one of the Most Bizarre Crimes in Utah History	\\"Salamander: The Story of the Mormon Forgery Murders\\" is a very fine analysis of one of the most bizarre stories in Mormon history. It tells the story of the Salt Lake City bombings on 15 and 16 October 1985 that killed Steven F. Christensen and Kathleen B. Sheets and seriously injured Mark W. Hofmann.<br /><br />One of the scenarios developed during the period immediately following the deaths of Christensen and Sheets on 15 October, associated the bombings with high finance and the crumbling business empire of J. Gary Sheets, husband of Kathleen and former associate of Christensen. Sheets' business, CFS Financial Corporation, was in a well-publicized nose-dive. His investors and creditors were clamoring for repayment and Sheets was considering bankruptcy. Christensen had left CFS a few months earlier unhappy with the direction Sheets had charted for the company. Could Sheets have planted the bombs to collect insurance money on the victims or to keep them from talking about illicit business dealings? Could disgruntled investors have placed the bombs? No one knew.<br /><br />If this were true, it bore no relationship to the Mormon church. The monkey-wrench in this scenario was what appeared to be the attempted murder of Hofmann on the morning of 16 October. He was not associated with CFS in any way, but he had a business relationship with Christensen revolving around the discovery and sale of Mormon historical documents. Christensen had purchased from Hofmann the so-called \\"Salamander Letter\\" of Martin Harris to W.W. Phelps, which had been unveiled in a circus-like meeting of the Mormon History Association in May 1985. After Hofmann's bombing most of the speculation suggested that the murders were linked to that document and the study of Mormon origins.<br /><br />Dated 23 October 1830, this letter narrated a strikingly different story of Book of Mormon origins than most were familiar with from the standard faith story. It suggested that Joseph Smith was intimately involved in folk magic (one aspect of which involved a white salamander who guarded the gold plates) and money-digging, and that the Book of Mormon was simply one more instance of these practices. Moreover, the messenger who delivered the plates to Joseph bore little resemblance to the benevolent being traditionally associated with the story. Instead, he was a crusty and malicious spirit who jealously guarded the treasure. The document seemed to hold the potential to destroy the underpinnings of faith for many naive believers.<br /><br />The \\"Salamander Letter\\" appeared to be a connecting link between the victims in this scenario for the bombings. Christensen had acquired this document from Hofmann; Kathleen Sheets' husband, who seemed to have been the real target of the bomb in this scenario, had been a business associate of Christensen.<br /><br />Most Mormon historians dismissed as absurd charges made by police investigators within a few days after the bombings that Hofmann was the primary suspect in the murders and that he had cold-bloodedly murdered Christensen to cover up illegal business dealings and Sheets to make it look like the killings were CFS-related. His own injuries, they thought, coming a day after the first murders were the result of the accidental detonation of a third bomb intended for yet another victim. Mark Hofmann was the closest thing the Mormon historical community had to a genuine celebrity. As the discoverer of several overwhelmingly important Mormon documents, he was both nationally known and invariably well-liked. It seemed impossible that Hofmann was a forger and con-man par excellence who committed two grisly murders to stave off financial ruin and a public unmasking of his illegal business dealings.<br /><br />As it turned out, the police were right. Authors Sillitoe and Roberts describe how Hofmann had brutally murdered Christensen and Sheets and had injured himself while handling a third bomb in his car. He had committed murder to mask a complex array of white-collar crimes that extended back to his student days in the late 1970s at Utah State University. These crimes demonstrated a pattern of deceit and manipulation that was impressive in its size, scope, and length of time.<br /><br />The immediate causes of the murders, according to the authors, revolved around a complicated collection of documents worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, the McLellin Collection. William McLellin had been one of the original Twelve Apostles of 1835 but had left the church in 1838. Evidence suggests that he collected considerable material on the development of Mormonism. The McLellin Collection was fabled as a treasure trove of important historical materials, many of them damaging to the church's traditional view of history.<br /><br />In 1985 Hofmann claimed to have found the collection and borrowed huge sums--a $185,000 signature loan that Hugh Pinnock, a high-Mormon leader, had arranged in one instance--from several different people, each unknown to the other, for the purpose of acquiring it. In effect he sold the same collection to several different people. Hofmann did not produce the collection for any of his investors and during the fall of 1985 increasing pressure was bore on him to repay his creditors or to produce the collection. He staved them off for a time with some very slick tap-dancing and even secured backing for his bank loan by having Pinnock arrange for a wealthy Mormon to buy the collection from Hofmann and donate it to the church. The money obtained from this sale would not only pay back the $185,000 bank note but also provide Hofmann with a tidy profit.<br /><br />Christensen, who had dealt with Hofmann before, volunteered to serve as a middle man for the movement of the collection from Hofmann to the church. As such he became a key player when Hofmann defaulted on the $185,000 loan and Pinnock asked him to press Hofmann for settlement. Christiansen was persistent and Hofmann was increasingly unable to avoid his probes. The bombing of Christensen would buy him time since his main protagonist would be out the way, Hofmann thought; maybe the church would drop the matter entirely. The bombing of Sheets was a diversion that would make Christensen's murder appear CFS-related.<br /><br />The authors suggest that the 15 October murders did not dissuade the church from completing the transaction for the McLellin collection. In one of the most satisfying sections in the entire book they describe how Hofmann was informed after the Christensen and Sheets murders, which most people at first thought were CFS-related, that the deal was still on track and Christensen would be replaced by Donald Schmidt, the retired LDS Church Archivist. Desperate action was required, so Hofmann built a third bomb. The victim would be another decoy, this time one associated with Mormon document dealings.<br /><br />Brent Ashworth, a successful lawyer and businessman who also bought collectible documents, was the ideal target. He and Hofmann had been meeting most Wednesdays in Salt Lake City for years, 16 October was a Wednesday, and he could easily get him to accept a bomb wrapped in a package similar to the first two. Afterward, Hofmann believed, there would be no pressure to proceed with the McLellin deal. This time, theoretically, all of Hofmann's objectives would have been achieved. But Ashworth did not meet him in Salt Lake City on 16 October and the bomb accidentally detonated. Hofmann was seriously injured and the police investigators at the scene quickly found tell-tale clues implicating him in the bombings.<br /><br />The police pursued the leads discovered at the site of the third bomb to a logical conclusion and built a tremendously convincing circumstantial case against Hofmann. Although it took months, Hofmann was finally charged with the murders and several lesser crimes in February 1986. The evidence presented in the preliminary hearings thoroughly convinced Judge Paul Grant. According to the authors, \\"At the beginning of the preliminary hearing, Grant had thought perhaps Hofmann was innocent. But by the end, he thought him clearly guilty, a pathological liar with no conscience and no remorse\\" (p. 454). A plea bargain resulted, with Hofmann pleading guilty to certain of the charges and promising to answer questions about his operations in return for a commitment not to seek the death penalty.<br /><br />The authors of \\"Salamander\\" perform an admirable service by sketching in most of the details of the bombings, the document dealings, and the character of Mark Hofmann. They describe a man who was outwardedly a believing Latter-day Saint but who was motivated in his crimes by a lust for money and an opportunity to embarrass his church. Always gracefully and with a touch of pathos, the authors narrate the complex events leading up to the murders, the peculiar circumstances of the murder investigations, the discovery of the evidence incriminating Hofmann, and the legal fireworks surrounding the case.<br /><br />A forensic analysis by George J. Throckmorton, the technician who discovered the secret of the Hofmann forgeries, rounds out the volume and conclusively proves the illegitimate origins of 106 documents coming from the dealer, including all of his major finds.ent and Hofmann was increasingly unable to avoid his probes.

In the summer of 2004 esteemed space scientist James A. Van Allen, asked the poignant question, \\"Is human spaceflight obsolete?\\" He added: \\"Does human spaceflight continue to serve a compelling cultural purpose and/or our national interest?...Risk is high, cost is enormous, science is insignificant. Does anyone have a good rationale for sending humans into space?\\" Paul Levinson has an answer, one that should at least prove convincing to those wanting to believe even if it might not convince James Van Allen.<br /><br />Levinson says essentially that while cyberspace made virtual exploration of almost anything possible it has also demonstrated an under-appreciated fact of the human existence, cyberspace is a pale comparison to reality. We continue to seek firsthand human experience to understand and experience the universe. He addresses the full range of rationales for spaceflight, suggesting that the human desire to experience and explore is what makes us fully human. This is a work of advocacy that is poignant and provocative, suggesting that our desire to fly in space is just as much spiritual and eternal as it is practical, political, economic, and military.	2005-08-21

"Rapture" Offers an Answer, Incomplete Though it Might Be	\\"Rapture\\" is a truly interesting book, and worthy of serious consideration. It explores the bio-utopian impulse in modern America, charting the last thirty-some years of research into human biology and how it might apply to a range of issues. These include not only the decoding of the human genome for the improvement of human life, but also the possibilities of life extension for decades and perhaps centuries. Those who advocate life extension see a \\"brave new world,\\" pun intended, in which all are healthy, happy, and wise. They view it as the next stage in human evolution. It is a heady goal, one that has consumed some billionaires and fueled a revolution in bio-technology. Public advocates in the United States range from billionaire William Haseltine to Ray Kurzweil, but include thousands more in a subculture known to few.<br /><br />Advocacy of bio-utopian ideas opens a wide array of ethical considerations, and opposition to it has ensured a rollicking debate between the extreme positions. The bio-luddites, in author Brian Alexander's parlance, question the morality of altering the human body through genetics, chemicals, or technology. They recall images of Nazi eugenics and the selective breeding of humans. Those in favor, of course, emphasize the positive results of intervention in whatever form it might take.<br /><br />My own interest in this subject comes from my study of the past, present, and possible future of spaceflight. For instance, one of the truly fascinating developments associated with interstellar spaceflight is the possibility of a trans-human migration. In fulfilling the spacefaring dream, the intelligent life to leave Earth and colonize the galaxy may not be entirely human in form. Extensive discussions have taken place in recent years on the relationship between artificial computer intelligence, biotechnology, and human evolution. In spite of its obvious relevance to space travel, little of this has been extended to outer space, and it is not in \\"Rapture\\" either, but it offers a fascinating possibility.<br /><br />The rigors of galactic flight that will likely confine humans to the inner solar system might not confine reengineered humans that have a cyborg quality about them. Given the great difficulties of interstellar flight, humans reengineered to withstand long duration space travel, possibly iwth technological enhancements might represent the future of spaceflight. The possibilities are truly amazing and somewhat weird, and as remote today from common experience as were the early images of space travel to the people who first envisioned them. Nonetheless, they are not wholly impossible. Because of current directions in technology, a trans-human galaxy is not beyond the realm of possibility. In one such vision, biological species become so technologically proficient that they cease to exist in purely biological form. The possibilities for trans-human evolution has the potential to radically alter the dominant paradigm of human spaceflight.<br /><br />This interesting popular history of the trans-human movement is an important statement of an evolving debate in modern American society. We see vestiges of it in everything from the controversies over stem cell research to the fight over cloning.

He gained the reputation as an able administrator and a thoughtful advocate for technical expertise applied to the problems of the nation. As a result he served in several key advisory positions in the 1960s and 1970s, especially as head of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Science Advisor to Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.<br /><br />This book describes Stever's career in his various roles. It is a useful recollection of a significant individual. The most interesting part of this memoir deals with Stever's role in furthering science and technology during the cold war era. Always interested in advancing the linkage between science/technology and government, he served on several government and military advisory committees. For example, in 1947, he became a member of the U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. In 1955-1956 Stever took a leave of absence from MIT to serve as Chief Scientist with the Air Force. He also served on advisory committees with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), NASA, NSF, and Congress in the 1950s and 1960s. Stever was also a technical advisor to several private corporations such as Goodyear Tire and United Aircraft, helping them mostly with military issues.<br /><br />Beginning in 1970 Stever served on two key advisory committees for Richard Nixon, the Ad Hoc Science Panel and the Task Force on Science Policy. At the same time Nixon, who was impressed with his capabilities, appointed him to the National Science Board, the policy-making arm of NSF. These positions gave him greater visibility inside the Nixon administration, and opened the way for his appointment as NSF director in February 1972. This appointment was hardly surprising to those interested in the twists of science policy. Journalist Deborah Shapley wrote in \\"Science\\" magazine that Stever was clearly \\"the favorite-son candidate of both the Administration and the science-government advisory system through which he has risen for twenty years.\\" She added that Stever was \\"one of the few good Republican scientist-administrators\\" and that Nixon liked him because he would support administration initiatives.<br /><br />Stever suffered intense pressure in 1973 when Nixon abolished the office of Science Advisor to the President as being without real value and sent the responsibilities to Stever at NSF. This move, according to \\"Space Daily,\\" a publication specializing in these issues in Washington, represented \\"a reversal of the emphasis on science and technology generated 15 years ago.\\" To many, Stever's dual role as head of NSF and Science Advisor to the President represented a conflict of interest. Moreover, Stever was thought--rightly as it turned out--to have little access to Nixon and would be ineffective as an advocate for important scientific and technical programs. Stever now admits that he did not have the ear of the president, but insists he did the best he could.<br /><br />When Nixon resigned in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal in August 1974, Stever remained at the National Science Foundation and continued to help the Ford administration with science policy. As a result, when Ford reestablished the position of Science Advisor to the President in August 1976 he asked Stever to take the position. He served in that capacity until the change in administrations in January 1977. Upon leaving government service, Stever continued to be very active as an advisor on several commissions, panels, andother task forces.<br /><br />This book is an able reflection of a career as a public scientist and policy-maker. It is especially useful for understanding developments in science policy during the 1960s and 1970s. I recommend it as an important first person account of the role of science policy during one of the most tumultuous periods in modern American history.els, and other task forces. <br /> <br />This book is an able reflection of a career as a public scientist and policy-maker.

Although it took decades to complete the series, collectively the more than twenty volumes that appeared in this \\"Macmillan Wars of the United States\\" series reinterpreted American military history for a new generation of readers. K. Jack Bauer's volume deals with the origins, evolution, and immediate aftermath of the war with Mexico in 1846-1848. It is a powerful narrative exploring this relatively forgotten chapter in American history.<br /><br />I first read this book in graduate school in 1980, and I recently reread it to refresh my memory and assess its continuing relevance. Although first published more than thirty years ago, upon rereading I would still recommend it as the most authoritative one-volume history of the war, although there are others that are also capable narratives of the same subject. Those others include John S.D. Eisenhower's \\"So Far from God: The U.S. War with Mexico, 1846-1848\\" (New York: Anchor Books, 1989) and Otis A. Singletary's \\"The Mexican War\\" (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962). But I recommend this book as both a very useful overview and an insightful study of lessons -learned that might be applied to both the Vietnam and Iraq wars.<br /><br />Bauer's work, like much history of the 1970s, especially military history, was informed by the U.S. debacle in Vietnam. Americans had just suffered a defeat at the hands of a dedicated opposition fighting in its own territory. It represented a dramatic failure of the American Empire. Bauer expends considerable energy investigating the similarities, as well as the discontinuities, in these two episodes.<br /><br />First, like the nation's leadership during the Vietnam era, Bauer argues that the leadership of the United States in the 1840s understood virtually nothing about the Mexican civilization and failed to fathom attitudes and reactions to American ideas and attitudes. National leaders did not appreciate that positions accepted as sui generis in the United States did not persuade those on the other side of the Rio Grande. President James K. Polk, he notes, believed that just a little more pressure would force Mexico's Santa Anna to negotiate a mutually agreeable solution to differences.<br /><br />Second, Bauer believes that much of the history of the war with Mexico, like the Vietnam experience, revolves around a failure to deal with legitimate differences through diplomacy. The failure to communicate brought a devastating result for Mexico, and arguably for the United States as well since the acquisition of the American Southwest brought to the fore the question of the extension of slavery into U.S. territories. This led to the American Civil War of 1861-1865 and the Reconstruction period of 1865-1877.<br /><br />Third, Bauer explores the issue of public perceptions of the war. Some marched off believing that they represented the forces of manifest destiny sent from a republican nation to free a people under the domination of an evil dictator who deserved overthrow, Santa Anna. Many embraced the war not as an act of conquest, but as an act of kindness, done out of a sense of duty to help fellow humans in the Southwest. Others viewed it as bald-faced aggression and conquest. Those who did faced the challenge of opposing the policy of war while still seeking to show support for the troops engaged in the military action. It was a difficult balancing act, and over time those in opposition, like those opposing the Vietnam adventure became more strident in their criticisms. These differences did not reach the state of agitation seen in the 1960s over Vietnam only because the war with Mexico lasted only two years.<br /><br />Interestingly, the story Bauer tells here also has salience in relation to the American war in Iraq. The division of the nation's citizenry over this military action, the casting of Saddam Hussein as an evil dictator requiring our overthrow, the long-term negative consequences of the Iraq war, and a host of other issues suggest close parallels. I would hope that policymakers and military officials would restudy the war with Mexico for lessons about current challenges.<br /><br />Finally, and this also relates both to Vietnam and Iraq, Bauer warns of the folly of inadequate planning in undertaking foreign policy objectives. The military missteps, the inability to deal with sustained resistance, the lack of preparation for how to govern conquered provinces all portend both the Vietnam and Iraq experiences. Bauer draws explicit parallels to Vietnam, but since the book was published in 1974 readers are on their own to consider parallels to Iraq.

Hunsaker and the Rise of American Aeronautics	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Excellent Biography of One of the Pioneers of Aeronautics	Jerome C. \\"Jerry\\" Hunsaker was an internationally known teacher and researcher in aerodynamics during the first half of the twentieth century. He made significant contributions to the development of flight systems, fired the enthusiasm of more than a generation of later engineers involved in aviation research, and virtually created the aeronautical engineering program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His career spanned more than six decades of aircraft research and development, where his efforts helped to establish the scientific and mathematical basis for flight. This excellent biography of Hunsaker by William F. Trimble of Auburn University provides a compelling portrait of this pivotal figure in the history of aeronautics.<br /><br />Born on August 26, 1886, in Creston, Iowa, Hunsaker gratuated from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1908, and went on to graduate training at MIT. He earned a doctorate in 1916, and stayed at MIT to create the first American course on aeronautical engineering and to found the internationally famous Department of Aeronautical Engineering. Hunsaker remained at MIT most of the rest of his career, worked closely with the Navy, and trained more an a generation of engineers who carried on his legacy through their engineering accomplishments.<br /><br />This book does a fine job of capturing the career of this important aeronautical engineer.	2005-08-19

An Important Minority Report on the History of the U.S.	No historian of the United States is more provocative than Howard Zinn, whose leftist philosophy permeates his writings and never fails to challenge his readers. \\"The Twentieth Century: A People's History\\" is every bit as ambitious as his other works; it is drawn from the latter part of his \\"A People's History of the United States\\" with additional chapters to bring the chronicle to the end of the century. Like the majority of other works by Zinn, this one is a must read for anyone seeking to ensure the broadest possible perspective on the American past. What is presented here will be disturbing to many and perhaps angering to some, but as always he presents his analysis with a style and verve that is rigorous and often compelling. If you are not up to being challenged read something else that presents a more consensus perspective on the past, such as Stephen Ambrose or David McCullough. But if you are willing to consider that there might be more to the story of the twentieth century than you learned in school and from consensus historians, then ponder the ideas in this book.<br /><br />Zinn believes, and states throughout this work, that the dominant narrative of American history focusing \\"on the Founding Fathers and the Presidents weigh oppressively on the capacity of the ordinary citizen to act. They suggest that in times of crisis we must look to someone to save us: in the Revolutionary crisis, the Founding Fathers; in the slavery crisis, Lincoln; in the Depression, Roosevelt; in the Vietnam-Watergate crisis, Carter. And that between occasional crises everything is all right...The idea of saviors has been built into the entire culture, beyond politics. We have learned to look to stars, leaders, experts in every field, thus surrendering our own strength, demeaning our own ability, obliterating our own selves\\" (pp. 413-14).<br /><br />Zinn abhors this aspect of our culture, and seeks to tell the story of those who bucked it throughout the twentieth century. He argues that the power elite in America have created a system of control in which most people do not even realize they are being controlled. \\"With a country so rich in natural resources, talent, and labor power the system can afford to distribute just enough wealth to just enough people to limit discontent to a troublesome minority\\" (p. 414), he writes. Zinn notes that one percent of the nation owns one third of the wealth, and that the elite dole out just enough to placate the rest, all the while pitting them against each other. He adds, \\"These groups have resented each other and warred against each other with such vehemence and violence as to obscure their common position as sharers of leftovers, in a very wealthy country\\" (p. 414). This book is really about those who battled that system, and he celebrates Eugene Debs, Daniel and Philip Berrigan, Angela Davis, Martin Luther King, Bill Haywood, and thousands of others who challenged the status quo.<br /><br />No question, Zinn views the history of the twentieth century--as well as earlier--in the U.S. as a struggle between the haves and the have nots. The haves, he comments, have been enormously successful in securing their hegemony against far greater numbers in no small part because of \\"all-embracing symbols, physical and verbal: the flag, patriotism, democracy, national interest, national defense, national security\\" (p. 415). Appeals to these themes, he believes, have been effectively used to blunt the criticism of the system that otherwise might bring it tumbling down. Thus, George W. Bush has appealed to flag-waving patriotism to unite a divided country and maintain control rather than deal with the underlying reasons for terrorism, \\"deep grievances against the United States\\" (p. 474).<br /><br />\\"The Twentieth Century: A People's History\\" is a powerful book with ideas revolutionary in character. If you don't want to consider them then don't read it. Zinn certainly makes no apologies for his position. His is a distinctly minority voice in a discussion of the century just past, but an important and eloquent one.

In nine chapters, plus an introduction and conclusion, Washington, D.C., based attorney turned writer has told the powerful and sometimes provocative story of how the Homestead Grays moved to Washington, D.C., and set the stage for the breaking down of the color line in Major League Baseball (MLB). In this important book Brad Snyder moves beyond the singular actions of Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers and Jackie Robinson, which most people are familiar with, to explore the broader implications of race relations in baseball during the 1940s.<br /><br />In telling this story, \\"Beyond the Shadow of the Senators\\" is filled with  heroes and villains. The most significant hero is unquestionably Sam Lacy, a black writer with the \\"Washington Tribune,\\" a weekly oriented toward D.C.'s large African American community, who consistently called for the desegregation of MLB. Also heroic are the great stars of the Negro Leagues, especially Buck Leonard, Satchel Paige, and Josh Gibson, all of whom came to Washington to play before large crowds in the nation's capital. They demonstrated through their exploits the quality of talent in the Negro leagues, especially when juxtaposed against the hapless play of the Washington Senators of the American League. The villains include Clark Griffith, the financially strapped owner of the Senators whose willingness to rent Griffith Stadium to the Grays proved lucrative, and Grays owner Cumberland Posey who shifted his team from the Pittsburgh area to Washington to cater to the large middle-class African American community in Washington. Both Griffith and Posey had every reason to keep the segregated system intact because of the money they made. Moreover, Griffith was a blatant racist who integrated reluctantly and eventually moved the Senators from Washington to Minneapolis-St. Paul because, as he said in 1978, \\"you've got good, hardworking white people here\\" (p. 289).<br /><br />Ranging broadly from social history to baseball and back, Snyder captures the essence of the history of the Senators, the Grays, and wartime Washington's racial situation. It is a story of love and hate at the same time, as well as the quest for dignity of the minority population in a divided city. \\"Beyond the Shadow of the Senators\\" is a powerful book. Enjoy.<br /> <br />Ranging broadly from social history to baseball and back, Snyder captures the essence of the history of the Senators, the Grays, and wartime Washington's racial situation.

US	36818999	RIOU9ZW3SIIX2	0252072200	64386106	Myths America Lives By	Books	5	50	51	N	N	Excellent Discussion of American Myths	In this scintillating study of the development of the American epic, historian of religion Richard T. Hughes focuses on five major myths--and two lesser spin-off conceptions, manifest destiny and American capitalism--that gained currency with the earliest days of the nation and have grown, in some cases morphed, and in all instances still remain powerful statements of national belief.<br /><br />Myths, Hughes reminds us, is not so much a fable or falsehood, as it is a story, a kind of poetry, about events and situations that have great significance both for those involved and those that follow. Myths are, in fact, essential truths for the members of a cultural group who hold them, enact them, or perceive them. They are sometimes expressed in diffuse ideologies, but in literate societies like the United States they are also embedded in historical stories about our past.<br /><br />First, Hughes explores the myth of the United States as a chosen nation. It is no secret that the Puritan immigrants to America from England viewed themselves as God's elect favored above all others. It is less well known that a sense of \\"chosen-ness\\" motivated others who came to America and this sense of exceptionalism has found expression throughout the nation's history. The United States is a new \\"land of Canaan,\\" to use a religious conception, but this sense need not be solely expressed in religious tones. While Hughes focuses on religious conceptions, he notes that America as a land of opportunity where all may achieve their proper rewards through diligence and hard work is a part of this belief as well.<br /><br />Central to this sense of \\"chosen-ness\\" is the idea of a national covenant in which the inhabitants live justly and are rewarded as a result. At it's best, this myth calls on Americans to shoulder responsibilities that reflect what Hughes calls our national creed: \\"We hold these Truths  to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\\" Sometimes, perhaps even many times, in our national history, the American civilization has reflected this creed well and in so doing earned the respect and admiration of the world. At other times, and perhaps increasingly as time has passed, Americans have absolutized the myth of the chosen nation and used it to justify the wealth, privilege, and power of the nation as appropriate despite the disparities with other cultures.<br /><br />The second myth that Hughes discusses is America as Nature's Nation. The result of Enlightenment thinking in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, this myth suggests that the natural order of things is for all humans to be free and have liberty to do as they wish. At its most idealistic this myth affirms the American creed better than any other concept held by inhabitants of the United States. Absolutized, in Hughes' parlance, it \\"might suggest that whatever foreign policies America might put in place are by definition just and right, regardless of their impact on marginalized people, and that the rectitude of those policies should be self-evident to all the people of the world\\" (p. 193).<br /><br />Third, Hughes explores the myth of America as a Christian nation. He affirms that it was the avowed intention of the founders to create a fully secular government without Christian overtones. He expends considerable effort to demonstrate this position, yet over time the myth has become almost de rigueur. This is not an entirely bad development, Hughes believes, for at its best it calls Americans to adhere to Judeo-Christian virtues. At its worst, it could allow Americans to view any policy the nation implemented as somehow righteous and just, fully reflective of Christian teachings.<br /><br />Fourth, the author considers the myth of a millennial nation. This sense of creating a perfect society, anticipating the return of Christ in glory, has been present in American society from the very first. It also suggests that it is incumbent on those a part of this nation to further justice, equality, and liberty both inside and outside the confines of the United States. In many instances this is a positive set of attributes, as Hughes notes, but it might also be used to justify efforts \\"to export and impose its cultural and economics values throughout the world, regardless of the impact those policies might have on poor and dispossessed people in other parts of the world\\" (p. 193).<br /><br />Finally, the author comments on the myth of the innocent nation. Completely without justification, the United States has come to believe that whatever it does is just and righteous, and that it is locked in a desperate struggle with evil. This may be seen in virtually all periods of American history but it is especially present in the great struggles of the twentieth century. World Wars I and II especially led Americans to believe they were fighting for the survival of all that was good against forces of evil. But it also may be seen in the cold war against the Soviet Union, and in the aftermath of 9/11 in the global war on terrorism. This is an unfortunate development, according to the author. He notes, \\"the world does not, in fact, divide as neatly between good and evil as the myth of America as the Innocent Nation might suggest. Just how difficult it is for Americans to realize this truth became apparent in the days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as Americans once again divided the world into rigid categories of good and evil, with America standing clearly and unambiguously on the side of the right...\\" (p. 186).<br /><br />There is much to praise and little to criticize in this important book. It is highly recommended as a statement of American values, conceived at the birth of the nation and extending to the present. The work also presents critiques of these myths from a variety of perspectives. It offers a useful analysis of how Americans view the world and why they tend to see it as they do.f Christ in glory, has been present in American society from the very first.

First published in 1983, it is now available in this 2002 edition with a new preface. I first read \\"The Winged Gospel\\" soon after its publication and found it a path-breaking, provocative study that emphasized beliefs about the airplane held by the machine's early advocates. I recently reread it and was impressed once again by its insight and the reasonableness of its thesis.<br /><br />Stanford University historian Joseph J. Corn saw \\"air mindedness\\" in the first part of the twentieth century as something akin to a secular religion. It had articles of faith, creeds, acolytes, ceremonies, and sacred relics and spaces. The ability to fly represented the opportunity to transcend the earthly realm and reach a \\"higher plain,\\" something that many viewed as both romantic and religious experiences. Like all religions, secular or not, Corn concluded that airplane advocates based their ideas more on faith than on evidence.<br /><br />At a fundamental level \\"The Winged Gospel\\" explores the affect of imagination on the development of American aviation, but it is much more. Almost immediately after the Wright brothers first flew at Kitty Hawk in 1903, Americans came to view the airplane as what Corn has characterized as a romance that espoused beliefs anticipating the social effects of aviation upon the lives of ordinary people. For example, as Corn demonstrates, early advocates of the airplane predicted that virtually all of society's ills--war, poverty, pestilence, inequality, and ignorance--could be eradicated through the employment of that technology. This \\"air mindedness\\" served as a way to improve human life while encouraging the general development of aviation in the United States. Films, books, articles, and radio broadcasts celebrated the exploits of pilots as reformers and individual heroes aligned against bureaucracy, militarism, and private greed. Aviation advocates painted a vision of the future in which millions of people would fly through the air and be liberated by the experience.<br /><br />Accordingly, the airplane during the first decade of the twentieth century began to be touted as the great promise for the nation. Its advocates emphasized the wonders of a machine that allowed men to fly like birds. Some advocates said it would make war impossible, because of its ability to strike at the interior of an enemy nation and destroy its manufacturing capability. Others predicted the linking of the world together in a great net of nearly instantaneous transportation routes. A few even argued that airplanes could improve people's health and refine their aesthetic sensibilities.<br /><br />Collectively, this \\"winged gospel\\" changed the world, even if it did not deliver all of the promises its early advocates hoped. Corn ends his study in 1950, but it would have been interesting to trace the vestiges of the romance of aviation to the present. It is still present at some level, no doubt, but for most Americans direct experience with airplanes is limited to commercial air transportation and those are decidedly un-romantic and non-religious experiences.<br /><br />This is a powerful book and should be read by anyone interested in the history of aviation.

It is a good, serviceable biography; but it is far from great. In it, we learn about one of the earliest stars of major league baseball. Christy Mathewson had been born in 1880, attended Bucknell University and gained fame there as both a football and baseball player. He signed with the New York Giants and played sixteen seasons with them; arguably the most dominant pitcher in major league baseball during his time in the Majors. While with the Giants, Mathewson won 20 games thirteen times and 30 games four times. During that same period, he won at least 20 games twelve consecutive years (1903-1914). A power pitcher, Mathewson had the most wins in Giant franchise history (372), and had more than 2,500 strikeouts. Perhaps his most dominant performance came in the 1905 World Series when he pitched a record three shutouts in six days against the Philadelphia Athletics, leading the Giants to the championship.<br /><br />Robinson does a credible job telling the story of Mathewson's remarkable career. He expends considerable effort narrating the dramatic events of his various pitching performances. He also delves into the story of Mathewson's close relationship with his Giants manager, the legendary John McGraw, who is credited with working effectively with a sensitive and talented player to make him more dominant than he might have been otherwise. Robinson also explores the role Mathewson plays in helping to remake the image of major league baseball from one of rowdy hooliganism into one of the \\"national pastime.\\" Mathewson served as a model of clean living when the sport was known for its hard-living, hard-drinking players. He became a role model for young boys, and MLB exploited his lifestyle to remake its image. He enthusiastically aided this process, and even wrote a series of boy's books advocating a moral, strenuous lifestyle.<br /><br />Of course, Mathewson served as the perfect example of \\"clean living\\" for MLB because of his dominance on the mound. Accordingly, in 1936 he joined four other MLB legends--Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Ty Cobb, and Walter Johnson, none of whom exemplified \\"clean living\\"--as the first class of baseball players to be inducted into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. It was a posthumous induction because Mathewson had died in 1925, at age 45, of tuberculosis.<br /><br />Ray Robinson has written a solid, readable biography of Matty.

Is is the third volume in a trilogy entitled, \\"A History of Modern Planetary Physics.\\" While there is considerably more in \\"Fruitful Encounters: The Origins of the Solar System and of the Moon from Chamberlin to Apollo\\" than the science accruing from Project Apollo, that was my major interest in reading the book. In \\"Fruitful Encounters\\" Stephen G. Brush of the University of Maryland spends considerable effort discussing the scientific return from Apollo during the 1960s and 1970s. Placing the history of lunar science into a broad continuum from the eighteenth to the twentieth century he explores the evolution of scientific thinking about the origins of the solar system and the evolution of its bodies. As historian Ronald E. Doel commented, \\"one of Brush's pursuits over the years has been to employ the history of nineteenth and twentieth century physical science to assess the adequacy of Kuhnian, Popperian, Lakatosian theories of science to evaluate the production of scientific knowledge, and Brush turns to these issues again here. He is particularly effective in pointing to historical example that refute Lakatos's claims that scientists never falsify a theory before the emergence of a better theoretical alternative\\" (Ronald E. Doel, \\"Theories and Origins of Planetary Physics,\\" Isis 90 (September 1999): 563-68).<br /><br />Brush's arguments focus on the longterm development of theory and its interaction with scientific inquiry. As such, it is a model of how such issues as lunar science accomplished with Apollo missions might be incorporated into larger history of science.<br /><br />This is an outstanding work for anyone seeking to understand the evolution of scientific understanding about the Solar System, and the place of the Moon landing program in the larger research setting. Highly recommended.	2005-05-26

Johnson of the University of North Dakota's Space Studies Department, skillfully interweaves technical details and fascinating personalities to describe the rise of systems management in the U.S. and Europe. It is a very important work that uses Apollo as its key example. Only through the application of sophisticated management concepts were such a complex activity as the Apollo Moon landings accomplished.<br /><br />Reviewers received Johnson's work warmly and it has been accepted as an exceptionally important study of how Apollo technology succeeded. As Erik Rau of Drexel University commented: \\"[Systems management (SM)] forced new temporal and financial discipline on contractors and engineers, imposed practices that undermined functional organization and loyalties, and subjected to scrutiny all institutions and firms involved in the project. Schedule and cost slippages on large government-sponsored projects may have continued, but Johnson asserts that SM minimized their rate. In fact, Johnson persuasively argues that without the bureaucracy of SM, success on several large aerospace projects would have been unlikely\\" (\\"Enterprise & Society\\" 3 (2003): 372-74).<br /><br />While Johnson argued that systems management allowed the accomplishment of large-scale technological endeavors such as Apollo, it did not do so on the cheap. Costs rise as the engineering team manage for schedule and reliability, since they are interrelated and must be managed as a group. This held true for the Apollo program. The schedule, dictated by the president, was firm. Since humans were involved in the flights, and since the president had directed that the lunar landing be conducted safely, the program managers placed a heavy emphasis on reliability.<br /><br />Accordingly, Apollo used redundant systems extensively so that failures would be both predictable and minor in result. The significance of both of these factors forced the third factor, cost, much higher than might have been the case with a more leisurely lunar program such as had been conceptualized in the latter 1950s. As it was, Johnson concludes, this was the price paid for success under Kennedy's lunar landing mandate. Of course, understanding the management of complex structures for the successful completion of multifarious complex tasks was an important outgrowth of the Apollo effort.<br /><br />This is a critically important book in the historiography of Project Apollo and human spaceflight. It is must reading for anyone interested in the evolution of spacefaring in the last fifty years. I recommend it highly as a worthy study of the history of the systems management that allowed the success the Apollo program.uch higher than might have been the case with a more leisurely lunar program such as had been conceptualized in the latter 1950s.

After doing so I have a much greater appreciation for Richard Wade's work than before, and I recommend \\"The Urban Frontier\\" as a seminal analysis of the rise of the west.<br /><br />Using a wealth of material ranging from the census to city records Wade constructs a portrait of Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Lexington, Louisville, and St. Louis between 1790 and 1830. As might be expected his focus is on the development of civic institutions, on the establishment of commerce, and on the political, economic, and social structure of these towns. Not surprisingly, Wade finds that these western cities evolved quickly to mirror their eastern counterparts. As he wrote: \\"The urban origin of Western towndwellers was significant, for it meant that the new cities would be built in the image of older ones. There was little need to experiment, because tried ways and methods were well known and seemed appropriate. Indeed, the newcomers, their lives disrupted by movement, were anxious to recreate as much as possible of the familiat landscape they had left. Hence, it is not surprising that Western towns bore a physical likeness to Eastern ones. Even social institutions were shaped by the same impulse. Whatever provided continuity was cherished\\" (p. 321).<br /><br />This is a powerful conclusion, one that directly challenged the famous \\"Frontier Thesis\\" of historian Frederick Jackson Turner first enunciated in 1893. Turner's ideas about the American experience being fundamentally shaped by its frontier origins has exerted a powerful force on the historiography of the United States, in no small measure because of its commanding statement of American exceptionalism. Turner took as his cue an observation in the 1890 U.S. census that the American frontier had for the first time closed. He noted, \\"Up to our own day American history has been in a large degree the history of the colonization of the Great West. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward explain American development.\\" He insisted that the frontier made Americans American, gave the nation its democratic character, and ensured the virtues of self-reliance, community, and the promise of justice. He noted that cheap or even free land provided a \\"safety valve\\" that protected the nation against uprisings of the poverty-stricken and malcontented. The frontier also produced a people with \\"coarseness and strength...acuteness and inquisitiveness, that practical and inventive turn of mind...[full of] restless and nervous energy...that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom.\\" It gave the people of the United States, in essence, virtually every positive quality they have ever possessed. (See Frederick Jackson Turner, \\"The Frontier in American History\\" (New York:  Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1920), which includes the seminal 1893 essay, \\"The Significance of the Frontier in American History\\").<br /><br />\\"The Urban Frontier\\" of Richard Wade demonstrates that this reading of American development is flawed. If Americans recreated in the early western urban experience the look and feel of eastern cities then the \\"Frontier Thesis\\" was suspect and another model for explaining why Americans were different from others had to be found.

It is sometimes exciting, sometimes unnerving, and sometimes infuriating but always provocative. Forsberg uses the tools of the \\"new historicism\\" and the deconstruction of texts to analyze the origins of Mormonism, especially a posited relationship to Freemasonry in the early national period. I think most historians will find Forsberg's effort to reinterpret this important episode in Mormon and U.S. history intrigung but somewhat unsuccessful.<br /><br />Forsberg advances the exceptionally bold and maverick thesis that Joseph Smith Jr. patterned this new religion after radical American Freemasonry. While he focuses initially on the Book of Mormon--for which he claims numerous parallels to Masonic conceptions, ceremonies, and conventions--Forsberg extends his incessantly restated thesis to most of the founding prophet's ideas. Forsberg presses his belief in Smith's indebtedness to Western esotericism and occultism--especially concerning Freemasonry--beyond all reasonable possibilities. Even so, \\"Equal Rites\\" helps to explain some of Mormonism's early attraction, for Smith's efforts hit at the center of humanity's desire to know something that is ultimately unknowable from secular rationality.<br /><br />Forsberg's key contribution may be in forcing a re-situation of early Mormonism in the historical context of American politics and culture, ethnic and gender relations, and religion. Equal Rites ranges broadly to place Joseph Smith and the rise of a new religious tradition squarely within a fresh context. Forsberg is concerned with Mormon origins, especially the elements that came together to make the Latter-day Saint movement such a powerful and compelling force in the 1830s and 1840s. He, in essence, dares anyone to ignore his challenging reinterpretation of the influence of Masonry on the origins and development of Smith's esoteric religion. Certainly, this work leaves many previously asked questions unanswered and raises a host of new ones. This should make his ideas the target of exceptional investigation, if only to refute them. In addition, Forsberg's witty prose make this an entertaining book to read, something usually not the case with Mormon historical works which as a genre emphasize the mundane and trivial.<br /><br />Forsberg's case is overstated and subject to considerable criticism. His thesis is circumstantial at best, wishful thinking some of the time, and a downright concoction at worst. There are quite a lot of qualifiers in this book, words such as \\"may,\\" \\"perhaps,\\" and \\"arguably\\" lacing the connections between a Masonic idea and a Mormon one. These suggest the tenuous nature of the relationships that Forsberg tries to draw between Mormonism and Masonry. While there are undoubtedly some legitimate relationships, as in the incorporation of Masonic ideas and ceremonies into the temple endowment developed in Nauvoo, those connections are not the ones that Forsberg seeks to draw. He insists on the close intertwining of Mormon/Masonic concepts and ceremonies from the very beginning of Smith's religious journey. I am intrigued but certainly not persuaded by his argument.<br /><br />Let me offer but one of many examples of Forsberg's overreaching that I could discuss. Concerning Joseph Smith's \\"First Vision,\\" an experience everyone recognizes as seminal to the origins and development of Mormonism, Forsberg tries to draw parallels between Smith's account of his experience and Masonic initiation ceremonies. He writes: \\"Smith recalls coming to his senses [after wrestling with forces of darkness] sometime later, flat on his back and staring upward toward heaven. One may compare this to the initiation of the Master Mason: blindfolded and not permitted to speak, the initiate must lie flat on his back and await the moment of release when the Grand Master takes him by the hand,lifts him up in an embrace known as the five points of fellowship, and, removing the blindfold, whispers the great mystery (the Grand Omnific Word) in his ear...\\" (pp. 57-58). Is this an interesting set of commonalties between the Masonic ceremony and Smith's account of the \\"First Vision?\\" Yes. Does it require a conclusion that one was the source of the other? No. But Forsberg would have us believe that this is the case. This is the type of argument made repeatedly in Equal Rites. I am unpersuaded.<br /><br />Even with these reservations there is much of interest in \\"Equal Rites.\\" Ultimately it makes a circumstantial case for accepting Masonry as critical to the formation of Mormonism. It should stimulate a lot of historical inquiry. I welcome the book's publication on that basis.the hand, lifts him up in an embrace known as the five points of fellowship, and, removing the blindfold, whispers the great mystery (the Grand Omnific Word) in his ear...\\" (pp. 57-58).

In the mix Gemini is often forgotten. David Harland's book helps to rescue the program from its obscurity. While it was initially conceived before Apollo got underway in 1961, after the commitment to the Moon landing Gemini morphed into a program to develop the skills necessary to reach the Moon. NASA closed most of the gap by experimenting and training on the ground, but some issues required experience in space. Three major areas immediately arose where this was the case. The first was the ability in space to locate, maneuver toward, and rendezvous and dock with another spacecraft. The second was closely related, the ability of astronauts to work outside a spacecraft. The third involved the collection of more sophisticated physiological data about the human response to extended spaceflight.<br /><br />To gain experience in these areas before Apollo could be readied for flight, NASA devised Project Gemini. Hatched in the fall of 1961 by engineers at Robert Gilruth's Space Task Group in cooperation with McDonnell Aircraft Corp. technicians, builders of the Mercury spacecraft, Gemini started as a larger Mercury Mark II capsule but soon became a totally different proposition. It could accommodate two astronauts for extended flights of more than two weeks. It pioneered the use of fuel cells instead of batteries to power the ship, and incorporated a series of modifications to hardware. Its designers also toyed with the possibility of using a paraglider being developed at Langley Research Center for \\"dry\\" landings instead of a \\"splashdown\\" in water and recovery by the Navy. The whole system was to be powered by the newly developed Titan II launch vehicle, another modified ballistic missile developed for the Air Force. A central reason for this program was to perfect techniques for rendezvous and docking, so NASA appropriated from the military some Agena rocket upper stages and fitted them with docking adapters.<br /><br />Problems with the Gemini program abounded from the start. The Titan II had longitudinal oscillations, called the pogo effect because it resembled the behavior of a child on a pogo stick. Overcoming this problem required engineering imagination and long hours of overtime to stabilize fuel flow and maintain vehicle control. The fuel cells leaked and had to be redesigned, and the Agena reconfiguration also suffered costly delays. NASA engineers never did get the paraglider to work properly, and eventually they dropped it from the program in favor of a parachute system like the one used for Mercury. All these difficulties shot an estimated $350 million program to over $1 billion. The overruns were successfully justified by the space agency, however, as necessities to meet the Apollo landing commitment.<br /><br />By the end of 1963 most of the difficulties with Gemini had been resolved and the program was ready for flight. Following two unoccupied orbital test flights, the first operational mission took place on March 23, 1965. Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom commanded the mission, with John W. Young, a naval aviator chosen as an astronaut in 1962, accompanying him. The next mission, flown in June 1965, stayed aloft for four days, and astronaut Edward H. White II performed the first American extravehicular activity (EVA), or spacewalk. Eight more missions followed through November 1966. Despite problems great and small encountered on virtually all of them, the program achieved its goals. Additionally, as a technological learning program, Gemini had been a success, with 52 different experiments performed on the 10 missions. The bank of data acquired from Gemini helped bridge the gap between Mercury and what would be required to complete Apollo within the time constraints directed by the president.<br /><br />This story is well-told in Harland's account. It is not an official history of the program, but concentrates on the story of the planning for and the execution of the 10 human Gemini missions.

Why not the other way around? The answer, for historian Michael Adas of Rutgers University, rests with the development of western science and technology, and the manner in which these systems of knowledge were understood and used. Indeed, Adas is most concerned with how Europeans employed these understandings to relate to the non-Europeans they encountered. Dividing the book in three parts--before the industrial revolution, the age of industrialization, and the twentieth century--Adas brilliantly analyzes the change over time of how Europeans related to these other cultures. Always, as he finds by unpacking explorers' and other observers' accounts, Europeans expressed superiority for the others they found. Sometimes they claimed moral and social superiority but at other times, and increasingly as time progressed, they asserted scientific and technical preeminence. As European industrialization took hold, the question of superiority moved almost exclusively from a moral basis to a material one, based on the creation of the more complex machines that emerged beginning in the seventeenth century.<br /><br />Adas spends the majority of this challenging book building a complex and highly significant story of colonial justifications. He uses a broad range of sources from philosophers and thinkers such as Voltaire to explorers to such proponents of British imperialism as Rudyard Kipling to show the evolution of the colonial ideal. What emerges is a portrait, embraced by the Europeans, of Europe as clearly preeminent in the world and having the responsibility to civilize and christianize the \\"backward\\" peoples of the Earth. For Europeans, as Adas shows, the rise of science and technology, as well as the ideas of the Enlightenment, signified the defeat of superstition, paganism, and irrationality. They had the duty, Europeans believed, to accept what came to be called the \\"white man's burden\\" to bring the blessings of western culture to those elsewhere. It would require centuries of \\"tutoring,\\" a period in which colonizers would rule those other cultures and bring the fundamental changes they valued. Colonial rule, Adas points out, was not just for the extraction of natural resources and for the brutal exploitation of those colonized--although that did take place--but also for the \\"civilizing\\" of \\"barbarians.\\" The author notes that the United States, soon after its creation took essentially the same approach toward dealing with Native Americans and other inhabitants of North America, and later in its wars of conquest in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Of course, this book was written well before the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but similar justifications have been voiced by American officials as the reason for overthrowing Saddam Hussein.<br /><br />If all of this sounds like a massive rationalization of colonial rule and its ever present oppression, it was. Few, at least as Adas tells the story, recognized it at the time, but one must ask if there were not minority reports on the legitimacy of what was taking place? Famed University of Chicago historian William H. McNeill, questioned this in his review of \\"Machines as the Measure of Men.\\" He writes, \\"Adas may be quite correct in the conclusions he offers, but the evidence he uses is intrinsically imperfect. Quotations from European writers of the 19th century who deplored technology and declared it was destroying true civilization are easy to find; a collection of passages could also readily be used to prove the exact opposite of what Adas tells us. Who might be right?\\" (Quoted from \\"Quarterly Review of Biology\\" 65 (June 1990): 211.)<br /><br />Notwithstanding this question, Adas has provided readers with a powerful analysis of the justifications for colonialism that reigned for more than five centuries. While the arguments changed over time, as Adas pointsout, the change was more in degree than in structure. Always the preeminence of European culture was preserved. First, Europeans defined themselves in relation to other cultures principally by religion. This changed with the Enlightenment, when moral philosophy began to reign. Add to this scientific and technological virtuosity and the supremacy of European institutions was assured. The broad thrust of this argument is persuasive, and indeed modern science and technology remains a significant measure of cultural worth to the present. Adas's work is recommended as a powerful statement of European attitudes toward other civilizations and the justifications use to buttress colonialism.re in degree than in structure.

Andrew Chaikin's account of the Apollo program focuses almost exclusively on the astronauts and their efforts to reach the Moon. He interviewed virtually all of them and undertook in depth historical research at NASA and other locations. The story that he tells is one of the best recounting of the master narrative that has emerged since the ending of the Apollo program in 1972.<br /><br />At the center of this story are the astronauts themselves. The role of the astronauts has remained central to the Apollo story to the present time in one of the truly great examples of mythmaking in modern American history, in no small part due to the exemplification of their image offered by Chaikin in this book. All astronauts are viewed as virtuous and heroic, cool under pressure, and technologically dexterous. They are brilliant and attractive; impressive in every setting. They are able, bold, learned, and brave. They ooze Americanism and patriotism of the highest caliber from every pore. Could any of them ever go wrong? Of course not! They remain sought after like only a few other celebrities. Their unwritten code of honor remains enormously attractive and Chaikin's unpacking of the astronaut culture in exceptionally powerful.<br /><br />But it is Duke University history professor Alex Roland who captured the importance of this book best: it is a retelling of a specific myth and in that retelling it performs a specific purpose. It is not so much history, in Roland's conception, as it is a restatement of \\"tribal rituals, meant to comfort the old and indoctrinate the young\\" (Alex Roland, \\"How We Won the Moon,\\" New York Times Book Review, July 17, 1994, pp. 1, 25). The epic nature of the undertaking illuminates every chapter of this elegant work.<br /><br />Indeed, throughout this book one finds that Chaikin struggles to maintain an epic aura of Apollo in his recitation of the voyages of discovery. They turned into a dead end rather than a new beginning and no amount of heroic prose can overcome that ironic plot twist. From the heroism of the astronauts to the epic landing, through the heroic rescue of Apollo 13, to the last anti-climatic flights of Apollos 15, 16, and 17, the mythic proportion of Apollo shines through.<br /><br />Of course, I don't want to suggest that Apollo as a mythic event is a bad thing. Myth is not so much a falsehood--as many people seem to believe--as it is a story, a kind of poetry, about events and situations that have great significance both for those involved and those that follow. Myths are, in fact, essential truths for the members of a cultural group who hold them, enact them, or perceive them. They are sometimes expressed in diffuse ideologies, but in literate societies like the United States they are fundamentally embedded in historical narratives such as \\"A Man in the Moon.\\" As students of space history are now beginning to recognize, those who recollect the history of spaceflight also hold versions of these myths, and they in turn relate them to a range of experiences helping to explain our place in the world.<br /><br />\\"A Man on the Moon\\" is a highly successful statement of the mythological nature of Project Apollo. It may be constructively read in that context. I heartily recommend it for its detail and its insight, as well as its mythological dimension.maintain an epic aura of Apollo in his recitation of the voyages of discovery.

This question consumes this fascinating book by Kerwin Lee Klein, a member of the history faculty at the University of California.<br /><br />Klein uses the \\"Frontier Thesis\\" of Frederick Jackson Turner, first enunciated in 1893, to explore this dynamic throughout the twentieth century. Turner's \\"Frontier Thesis\\" is the most influential essay ever read at an American Historical Association's annual conference. It exerted a dominant force on the historiography of the United States, in no small measure because of its powerful statement of American exceptionalism. Turner insisted that the frontier made Americans American, gave the nation its democratic character, and ensured the virtues of self-reliance, community, egalitarianism, and the promise of justice. He noted that cheap or even free land provided a \\"safety valve\\" that protected the nation against uprisings of the poverty-stricken and malcontented. The frontier also produced a people with \\"coarseness and strength...acuteness and inquisitiveness, that practical and inventive turn of mind...[full of] restless and nervous energy...that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom.\\" It gave the people of the United States, in essence, virtually every positive quality they have ever possessed (pp. 13-22).<br /><br />Klein finds that Turner was an inveterate artist, despite his academic training and scholarly bent, who always swayed toward the poetic to the sacrifice of precision and clarity. Hence, a debate has raged since over the meaning of many of his ideas. What, after all, was the frontier: place, region, boundary, state of mind, etc? It varied from person to person and circumstance to circumstance. Indeed, Turner himself used the term in many different ways. Turner, as Klein points out, also expressed an enormously comic disposition--in the Shakespearian sense of a happy ending--concerning the development of the United States. Turner's narrative of America involved ordinary men, and they were all white men, challenging the wilderness to build a new civilization and in the process transforming the landscape and themselves into something better. Missing from Turner's narrative of America's march of democracy and egalitarianism, however, were the displaced civilizations swept away by the United States, the ethnic and other minority groups that inhabited the land, and the less happy elements of the master narrative that Turner and his adherents fashioned.<br /><br />Those missing elements from Turner's happy narrative was added by anthropologists beginning in the 1930s. Such scholars as Ruth Benedict and Edward Spicer used ethnographic methods to recover the story of the Native Americans and bring it to the center of the study of the U.S.'s westward movement. This effort, inspired by the scientific method and seeking to establish a precise, rigorous body of knowledge, resulted in a more \\"tragic\\" accounting of the frontier experience.<br /><br />These strains in the narrative--comic versus tragic--as well as in the approach--artistic versus scientific--have informed the manner in which historians, social scientists, and others have interpreted the frontier experience ever since. The zenith of the scientific approach probably came, according to Klein, with the 1959 publication of Merle Curti's \\"The Making of an American Community,\\" a valuable study of frontier mobility that nonetheless reads like computer instructions. As Klein writes, \\"Along the road from Turner to Curti, historical understanding metamorphosed from poetics to engineering\\" (pp. 122-23). The \\"new western history\\" that emerged in the 1980s accepted the more tragic elements of the narrative, without the trappings of scientific analysis, and it has remained dominant to the present.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed, and benefited from, Klein's brilliant discussion of postmodernism and its influence on recent historiographical trends in frontier studies. Its emphasis on narrative and \\"emplotment\\" offers insights into how historians have reinvigorated the field and suggests new avenues for exploration in the future. In the end, as Klein notes, \\"stories are what we live in\\" (p. 5), and the narrative constructs of historians embody the essence of what Americans want to believe about themselves. In such a context, since historians by definition tell stories it offers little to mimic the scientific method. Finally, Klein's call for \\"new varieties of historical imagination\\" is well taken.<br /><br />Klein's ambitious book takes readers through the development of western studies in the twentieth century and analyzes the complex evolution of an important genre of historical analysis. Klein's ambition may overstretch on occasion, but this book is a stimulating and rewarding reading experience. Not since the publication of Peter Novick's \\"That Noble Dream: The `Objectivity Question' and the American Historical Profession\\" (1988) has anyone attempted such a sweeping intellectual history of the discipline.

M.G. Lord seeks to unpack the history of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a contract facility of NASA, from its origins in the 1930s as a rocket development installation under contract to the U.S. Army to its current status as planetary science center par excellence. In attempting this analysis Lord presents a scintillating narrative of JPL's evolution that is part memoir/part history and always challenging and thoughtful. She uses the experience of her father, who worked as an engineer on the Mars Mariner 69 mission, as an entree point into the engineering culture of JPL. From there she delves deeply into the origins and evolution of the center from its creation by Frank Malina and his self-styled \\"suicide squad\\" who fired rocket engines in the Arroyo Secco near the present-day Rose Bowl during the latter 1930s. Using the tools of post-modern analysis and deconstruction, but without reliance on the jargon that makes so much of that work inaccessible, Lord successfully furthers understanding of two major themes in the history of spaceflight that have been largely misunderstood to the present. This first is the place of JPL in the history of rocketry and why it is less well-known than the accomplishments of other actors, especially Wernher von Braun and his German rocket team, in the public consciousness. Second, Lord explores the gendered aspects of rocketry and spaceflight and observes the very gradual entrance of women into the profession.<br /><br />The first theme that Lord illuminates is the systematic and selective writing of the history of spaceflight. For some fifty years Wernher von Braun and his German rocketeers who built the V-2 and then came to America at the end of World War II have been popularly interpreted as far-sighted visionaries with an integrated space exploration plan that would foster a future of great discovery in the \\"final frontier.\\" The historiography of spaceflight has lionized these individuals and maximized the team's role in the development of American rocketry and space exploration even as it minimized the wartime cooperation of von Braun and his \\"rocket team\\" with the Nazi regime in Germany. Both were conscious distortions of the historical record. Even today, few Americans realize that von Braun had been a member of the Nazi party and an officer in the SS and that the V-2 was constructed using forced labor from concentration camps. The result has been both a whitewashing of the less savory aspects of the careers of the German rocketeers and an overemphasis on their influence in American rocketry. Lord juxtaposes that master narrative of spaceflight history with a more accurate portrayal that shows that the United States developed a very capable rocket technology in such places as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and elsewhere. Led by Frank Malina, JPL developed jet-assisted take-off (JATO) rockets during the war and the WAC Corporal immediately thereafter. They even spun off a major corporation, Aerojet, that remains an important rocket engine company to the present.<br /><br />Lord asks, appropriately, why have Malina and the JPL rocketeers been largely forgotten while von Braun and the Germans received overwhelmingly positive publicity? \\"With accomplishments like these,\\" she writes, \\"you'd expect to find him [Malina] enshrined in history, alongside Goddard, the quirky collector of rocketry patents who did not work well with others, or von Braun, the oily ex-Nazi who very much did\\" (p. 66). The reason, Lord finds, is because Malina had ties to leftist organizations in the 1930s, although he always denied being a communist. Accordingly, his pedigree was not one of unabashed anti-communism and in the Red Scare era during the 1940s and 1950s it would not do for the keepers of this new and remarkably powerful technology of rocketry to have any propensity in favor of Marxism. Always conscious of the horror of rockets in war, Malina believed that his work in World War II was appropriate only to rid the world of a great evil. After World War II it did not take much hounding for him to leave JPL and accept employment with the United Nations. The U.S. government then ran Malina out of the U.N. as well, and he eventually became an artist in Paris where he died in 1981.<br /><br />For the first time, Lord draws starkly the systematic process whereby for political reasons the U.S. publicized a foreign rocket team, that of Wernher von Braun, while deemphasizing an American one under Malina's direction. As Lord concludes: \\"To a country that viewed international politics as a clash between teams--us and them, right and wrong, good and evil--Communists were them, wrong and evil. What is more, people who had expressed curiosity about communism in the 1930s were not allowed to reconsider. Regardless of the way their sympathies may have evolved, they were inexorably tainted\\" (p. 95). Because of this Malina and the accomplishments of his \\"suicide squad\\" were largely omitted from the history of spaceflight until the 1980s when they began to reemerge.<br /><br />The second theme that Lord investigates is the fascinating subject of gender in rocketry and spaceflight. Of course, aerospace engineering in the United States has been the province of a largely white male population. She describes how she found a pamphlet published at JPL in 1959 entitled \\"About Missiles and Men.\\" The title says much about the perspective of the NASA center in the era, but \\"The book's cover says a lot about sex and rocketry...It shows two missiles darting across the page--one placed so that it appears to rise from a ground technician's groin\\" (pp. 37-38). Lord explores gender throughout this book, using the career of Donna Shirley, who gained fame during the Mars Pathfinder mission of 1997, and who had been battling for greater acceptance of women at JPL since the early 1970s. It has been a slow process and Lord believes that there is much yet to accomplish on that score at both JPL and NASA.<br /><br />Throughout the book are several sustained analyses of gender in spaceflight. One of my favorites is Lord's deconstruction of a rocket launch: \\"One can easily interpret a launch as a symbol of masculine power. It involves a potent object penetrating the heavens. But what, I suspect, gives the experience its psychic resonance is that the imagery is also feminine. During preparations for a launch, the spacecraft is `mated' to the launch vehicle. The harsh, male abstractions of physics are described in the vocabulary of pregnancy and birth, the ultimate female acts of creation. A launch is more than just a knock-your-socks-off explosion. It is a kind of labor, a wrenching struggle to escape one world and move into another. On a deep, archetypal level it is profound--a uniting of the masculine and feminine in the sort of balance that Jungian psychologists believe the psyche seeks\\" (pp. 159, 161). Such insights are gems scattered throughout the book.<br /><br />There is much to recommend in this book, and I commend it to all. This is not a work of scholarship, per se. It is written for a broad market and refrains from references to Michel Foucault and the school of analysis he embodied. It does have, however, page sources at the conclusion to lead those interested to more extensive discussions. While Lord refrains from offering an overarching thesis, as would a work of deep scholarship, \\"Astro Turf\\" is an important discussion of the history of spaceflight from the standpoint of one NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The centennial of the first flight of the Wright brothers in December 2003 was no exception. This book is one product of that commemoration. It is essentially a collection of papers about the history of aerospace engineering education in the United States, each written by a different author or set of authors, especially focused on institutional history of 69 separate institutions created to train engineers in the mechanics of flight.<br /><br />The work is divided into six major parts. The first contains a general overview of the origins of aerospace engineering education. Part II focuses on the founding institutions in the field--MIT, the University of Detroit, the University of Michigan, and New York University. Part III explores the Guggenheim Foundation's efforts to further flight since the 1920s. Part IV, by far the largest section of the book, has individual chapters chronologically arranged about the major institutions of higher learning training aerospace engineers. In this section, there are capsule summaries of such stellar engineering schools as Caltech, Auburn University, and Purdue University, to name only a few. In Part V the authors review the role of the military service academies in training aerospace engineers. And to conclude the volume, Part VI contains succinct accounts of training programs evolved from corporations and other propriety institutions such as Boeing and Northrop.<br /><br />This is a useful work of compilation for bringing together the summaries of these various institutions. There is very little commonality of ingredients from chapter to chapter, and no sense of a single theme or thesis, so anyone using it to build a picture of the discipline will have to be creative in the use of the information. Some articles are referenced, others not. Some contain curricula over time, some do not. None ask overarching historical questions about the development of the aerospace engineering discipline. There is a discernable focus on individuals and heroic research and teaching. There are basic components of any work of non-fiction that are missing, such as an index.<br /><br />In the end \\"Aerospace Engineering Education During the First Century of Flight\\" is very much a history written by and for aerospace engineers. For all its virtues, and there are some, the overview offered here is replete with the linear process of aerospace \\"progress\\" to the very great exclusion of any social or cultural factors that might have influenced the evolution of the discipline. There is little of the obscurity of choices about research and training that might have enriched this story. We await a comprehensive and innovative history of this important subdiscipline in engineering education. There is yet to be written for aerospace engineers such a work as C.R. Day's \\"Education for the Industrial World: The Ecole d'Arts et Mtiers and the Rise of French Industrial Engineering\\" (MIT Press, 1987), which provides an outstanding case study in the evolution of technological consciousness, or even John Hubbel Weiss's \\"The Making of Technological Man: The Social Origins of French Engineering Education\\" (MIT Press, 1982).

The authors have written a fine historical synthesis of the period between the mid-1950s and the aftermath of Sputnik, focusing on the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union to launch the first orbital satellite. This work makes an important contribution in focusing on this first satellite race, and the authors explore the mirror image nature of the two programs, how they played off of each other, and why that was necessary to the manner in which the race unfolded. By keeping the space race front and center they succeed in creating a focus that is compelling and often missed in other studies of the same era.<br /><br />Bille and Lishock are at their best in probing the individuals who were the bearers of the spaceflight dream; many of whom seem to encounter obstacles (social, political, technical) at every turn, and then eventually surmount them to achieve success and plant the seeds for future accomplishment. At some level this represents a romantic narrative of transcendence, but one that is both evocative and powerful. The authors seem to suggest that it was the spaceflight true believers, rather than great nations locked in cold war rivalry or geopolitical machinations or the scientific method on each side, who were engaged in a race. Certainly they expressed frustration by the percerived foot dragging of their respective governments. Yet, Sergei Korolev in the Soviet Union and Wernher von Braun and others in the United States achieved the birth of the space age in this international race.<br /><br />Everyone should realize, of course, that this work is a synthesis. It is not intended as a sophisticated theoretical work--although something taking a post-modern approach to the subject would be quite interesting. It is, instead, a narrative that seeks to create a unified discussion of the rise of the American and Soviet rocket states. That rise, as the authors show, had long antecedents going back to the very earliest years of the twentieth century in both nations and a sophisticated technological base that allowed that longstanding vision to become reality. The authors also do a credible job of explaining the development of the Soviet Sputnik and the American Vanguard and Explorer programs. These represented the major elements of the \\"first space race\\" suggested in the title. While there is little new in this discussion the authors do a good job of bringing together salient elements from a wealth of serious historical writing on the subject in the last decade. This represents the best narrative available synthesizing this story.and a sophisticated technological base that allowed that longstanding vision to become reality.

Bayla Singer begins by noting that for millennia, people of all cultures have dreamed of flying.<br /><br />This book presents the realization of flight as part of a process embedded deep in modern civilization's psyche. At a fundamental level the author demonstrates the powerful human emotions associated with flight. In learning to fly, she argues, humanity may commune with deities--like with sex with gods. To engage in flight is to become like the gods, to transcend the Earthly plain and to reach for heaven. Think of that the next time a flight attendant is tossing you a bag or peanuts on an airliner.<br /><br />This is a rich and powerful history, one that will engage all readers and illuminate new perspectives on the history of flying.	2005-02-03

From the time of Konstantin Tsiolkovskiy through Robert Goddard, Hermann Oberth, and Wernher von Braun all the spaceflight visionaries believed that a space station was a necessary prerequisite to further human exploration of space. They recognized that once humans had achieved Earth-orbit about 250 miles up, the presumed location of any space station, the vast majority of the atmosphere and the gravity well had been conquered and that humans were now about halfway to anywhere else they might want to go. They could use it as a base camp at the bottom of the mountain or the fort in the wilderness, or use any other similar metaphor, to jump off on explorations of the Solar System. It became the centerpiece of an integrated strategy for space exploration, and found its most sophisticated depiction as a way station in the masterful 1968 Stanley Kubrick movie, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\"<br /><br />The first effort in the United States to build a space station was Skylab, launched in 1973 and occupied through 1974, a far cry from the rotating wheel of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" but nonetheless a genuine success story. It represented a preliminary space station and was a relatively small orbital space platform that would allow astronauts for the first time to remain in space for months at a time. It would be, NASA officials hoped, be the precursor of a real space station. This is the story that Shayler tells in this fine narrative history.<br /><br />It used a reconfigured and habitable third stage of the Saturn V rocket as the basic component of the orbital workshop. The 100-ton Skylab 1 workshop was launched into orbit on May 14, 1973, the last use of the giant Saturn V launch vehicle. Shayler is at his best when discussing the dramatic rescue effort that followed, for technical problems developed due to vibrations during lift-off When the meteoroid shield--designed also to shade Skylab's workshop from the Sun's rays--ripped off, taking with it one of the spacecraft's two solar panels, and another piece wrapped around the other panel to keep it from properly deploying. This caused a serious temperature rise inside Skylab that the astronauts had to correct.<br /><br />In an intensive ten-day period, NASA developed procedures and trained the crew to make the workshop habitable. On May 25, 1973, astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Paul J. Weitz, and Joseph P. Kerwin, lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in an Apollo capsule atop a Saturn IB and rendezvoused with the orbital workshop. This crew carried a parasol, tools, and replacement supplies to repair the orbital workshop. After substantial repairs requiring extravehicular activity (EVA), including deployment of a parasol sunshade that cooled the inside temperatures to 75 degrees Fahrenheit, by June 4 the workshop was habitable. During a June 7 EVA the crew also freed the jammed solar array and increased power to the workshop.<br /><br />In orbit the crew conducted solar astronomy and Earth resources experiments, medical studies, and five student experiments. This first crew made 404 orbits and carried out experiments for 392 hours, in the process making three EVAs totaling six hours and 20 minutes. The first group of astronauts returned to Earth on June 22, 1973, and two other Skylab missions followed. The Skylab 3 crew was launched on July 28, 1973, and its mission lasted 59 days. Skylab 4, the last mission on the workshop was launched on November 16, 1973, and remained in orbit for 84 days. At the conclusion of Skylab 4 the orbital workshop was powered down with the intention that it might be visited again.<br /><br />Following the final occupied phase of the Skylab mission, ground controllers performed some engineering tests of certain Skylab systems, positioned Skylab into a stable attitude, and shut down its systems. It was expected that Skylab would remain in orbit eight to ten years, by which time NASA might be able to reactivate it. In the fall of 1977, however, space agency officials determined that Skylab had entered a rapidly decaying orbit--resulting from greater than predicted solar activity--and that it would reenter the Earth's atmosphere within two years. They steered the orbital workshop as best they could so that debris from reentry would fall over oceans and unpopulated areas of the planet. On July 11, 1979, Skylab finally impacted the Earth's surface. The debris dispersion area stretched from the Southeastern Indian Ocean across a sparsely populated section of Western Australia. NASA and the U.S. space program took criticism for this development, ranging from the sale of hardhats as \\"Skylab Survival Kits\\" to serious questions about the propriety of space flight altogether if people were likely to be killed by falling objects. In reality, while NASA took sufficient precautions so that no one was injured, its leaders had learned that the agency could never again allow a situation in which large chunks of orbital debris had a chance of reaching the Earth's surface. It was an inauspicious ending to the first American space station, not one that its originators had envisioned, but it had opened some doors of understanding and had whetted the appetite for a full-fledged space station.<br /><br />David Shayler tells this story well, but without footnotes. If you wish to read the same story, also well told, but with references to official documents see the official NASA history by W. David Compton and Charles D. Benson, \\"Living and Working in Space: A History of Skylab\\" (Washington, DC: NASA Special Publication-4208, 1983).le attitude, and shut down its systems.

Although published in 1989 and long out of print, \\"Apollo: The Race to the Moon\\" stands out as the best popular book on the subject ever to appear. Neither a warmed over account of the astronauts and their adventures on the Moon nor a large-format illustrated history--both of which are in abundance--this book seeks to understand the larger contact of Apollo by focusing on the massive technical and scientific infrastructure that made the trips to the Moon possible. Taking as its central characters not the astronauts but the managers and engineers who ran the program, this book by famed author and political lightning rod Charles Murray and Catherine Bly Cox is based extensively on interviews with the remaining actors of the endeavor. The authors spent considerable time talking to NASA officials, both active and retired, at the Johnson Space Center, the Marshall Space Flight Center, and the Kennedy Space Centers, as well as high level officials in Washington. In this book Murray and Cox reconstruct a non-scholarly account of Apollo that examines operational details of the program that have gone undiscussed in astronaut-centric works.<br /><br />By taking this approach Murray and Cox shift the history of Apollo to its most appropriate place. They recognize that the feat, as impressive as it was and as heroic as the astronauts truly were, was essentially an accomplishment of systems management. It was an endeavor that demonstrated both the technological and economic virtuosity of the United States and established national preeminence over rival nations--the primary goal of the program when first envisioned by the Kennedy administration in 1961. It had been an enormous undertaking, costing $25.4 billion with only the building of the Panama Canal rivaling the Apollo program's size as the largest non-military technological endeavor ever undertaken by the United States and only the Manhattan Project being comparable in a wartime setting.<br /><br />Murray and Cox emphasize that Project Apollo was a triumph of management in meeting the enormously difficult systems engineering and technological integration requirements.

US	36818999	R3UQUYJGE3GYK2	0679415602	289885381	October 1964	Books	5	35	38	N	N	Social History Written for a Broad Audience	I recently reread David Halberstam's \\"October 1964,\\" about the World Series between the New York Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals. As other reviewers of this book on Amazon.com have noted, it is social history of a high order. Halberstam uses the World Series of 1964 as a foil to discuss race relations in the decade, both inside baseball and out, for the Yankees represented an approach to society reflective of a status quo that had much more to do with police brutality against civil rights workers in Selma than the Yankees would care to admit. Meantime, the Cardinals expressed much more of the changing climate in America.<br /><br />As Halberstam points out, it looked as if all the ingredients of a great team were coming together for the Cardinals in the early 1960s. The team had all of the attributes of its successful teams of the past, excellent pitching, great defense, and speed. But there was something more that was critical to the Cardinals success in 1964, as Halberstam emphasizes, how the team bridged the racial divide in the United States to create a cohesive unit. Everyone who visited the Cardinals locker room recognized that something was different from other teams. The African American, White, and Latino players seemed to have an easier relationship than elsewhere. No question, many of the premier players for the Cardinals were African Americans in 1964--Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, Curt Flood, and Bill White--and they certainly helped set the tenor of the clubhouse. But southerners like Ken Boyer and Tim McCarver were also committed to the successful integration of American life and brought that perspective to the team as well. This relative racial harmony was significant for the Cardinals and stood in striking contrast to the problems present with the Yankees and other major league teams.<br /><br />One anecdote about the Cardinals offered in \\"October 1964\\" elucidates this issue. Curt Flood recounted a story in \\"October 1964\\" of going to Cardinals spring training camp in Florida in the latter 1950s and finding himself sent to an African American boarding house in another town, instead of staying in the same hotel where his white teammates were housed. A sensitive and thoughtful man, Flood was both hurt and angered by this situation and when the opportunity presented he said something. When the Cardinals owner, August A. Busch Jr., saw him at the training camp and struck up a conversation Flood let slip that the situation of the black players was not the best. Busch was genuinely surprised that Flood and the other black players were not staying at the main hotel with the \\"rest of the guys\\" and promised to do something about it. He went out and purchased a hotel in St. Petersburg where all the Cardinals could stay together with their families during spring training.<br /><br />In later years, players from other teams recalled visiting that hotel to see members of the Cards and finding cookouts taking place with entire families, black and white, together. The fact that they lived together for several weeks during spring training may have broken down the barriers of prejudice more than any other action the Cardinals could have taken. The team was, without question, more successful in integrating its players than many other major league clubs. This contributed to the success of the team on the field and the attraction of the team off it.<br /><br />Halberstam emphasizes that the match between the Cardinals and Yankees in 1964 had symbolic value far beyond the match-up on the field. The Cardinals were a well-integrated team with excellent African American players. The Yankees had failed to integrate until the mid-1950s and then only modestly so. Indeed, their first African American player was St. Louis native Elston Howard and he only came up to the Yankees in 1955. A superb player, the Yankees ballyhooed Howard's breaking of the color line on the team by saying that he was a true \\"gentleman,\\" and thereby appropriate to wear Yankee pinstripes. One wit observed that this was so much nonsense, after all since when did baseball players have to be \\"gentlemen?\\" The Yanks in 1964 were also a franchise on the verge of collapse, with aging superstars and not much down on the farm to call up to the majors. Their best player, Mickey Mantle, was nearing the end of his Hall of Fame career, and his replacement in the outfield would be Bobby Mercer, a decent journeyman player but not someone who would carry on the tradition of Ruth-DiMaggio-Mantle.<br /><br />The Cardinals victory in the World Series in 1964 symbolized for Halberstam the death of the old manner of baseball, and thereafter every championship team would have African American stars as a critical element to success. It is an excellent discussion of the subject, well-written and thought-provoking.iate to wear Yankee pinstripes.

It covers the period between rocketry's origins more than 1,000 years ago in Asia and the middle part of the twentieth century when the technology proliferated in the West for both peaceful and military purposes. As such, this work will probably become a favored textbook in courses relating to the evolution of the technology.<br /><br />The book, in eighteen chronological chapters, takes the reader through a succession of ideas, experiments, and applications. Gruntman expends more than 100 pages before reaching the twentieth century, something unusual for most surveys with its emphasis on the earliest years of rocketry, and then proceeds to lay the groundwork for later developments by discussing \\"great pioneers\\" who paved way the toward spaceflight. These include the usual suspects--the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovskiy, the German Hermann Oberth, and the American Robert Goddard--but Gruntman also adds the Frenchman Robert Esnault-Pelterie, members of various rocket societies, and others to his list.<br /><br />The \\"first modern rocket,\\" in Gruntman's narrative, was the German V-2 built by Wernher von Braun's rocket team during World War II. It is at this point that events compound, advances in technology proliferate, and moral dilemmas arise. Simply put, many of those working in rocket programs wanted to develop the technology necessary to move beyond Earth, but their technology was used for destructive rather than peaceful purposes. As a classic example, Gruntman points out that Wernher von Braun served Hitler's Germany by developing the first ballistic missile, was a major in the SS, and used the horrific concentration camp labor system of [...] Germany to build V-2s. But he foresaw the potential of human spaceflight while working as little more than an arms merchant who developed brutal weapons of mass destruction. Von Braun never expressed any hesitancy about the morality of using scientific and technical knowledge to kill as many people and destroy as much as possible. In the 1960s, as the United States was involved in a race with the Soviet Union to see who could land a human on the Moon first, humorist Tom Lehrer wrote a song about von Braun's pragmatic approach to serving whoever would let him build rockets regardless of their purpose. \\"Don't say that he's hypocritical, say rather that he's apolitical,\\" Lehrer wrote. \\"`Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? That's not my department,' says Wernher von Braun.\\" Lehrer's biting satire captured well the ambivalence of von Braun's attitude on moral questions associated with the use of rocket technology.<br /><br />Indeed, it was because they could be used as weapons carriers that rocket development received the government largesse necessary to reach space in the 1950s. Spurnik, the first space satellite, was launched on a Soviet ballistic missile, as was the first American satellite, Explorer 1. Moreover, it was because of the cold war that such programs as Apollo, which landed Americans on the Moon in 1969, received any funding whatsoever.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the volume Mike Gruntman takes us on a whirlwind tour of developments worldwide and closes with an assessment of the 1,000+ years of rocketry.<br /><br />There is much to praise in this volume. It provides for the first time a modern, comprehensive overview of the subject. It also offers the best discussions available about some of the key breakthroughs in early twentieth century rocketry. There are also numerous sidebars explaining the technology and discussing the individuals who made it fly.<br /><br />But for all of the book's positive attributes, it is very much a history written for engineers. This is especially true because of the author's concern with the linear process of rocket technology to the very great exclusion of any social or cultural factors that might have influenced the engineers.<br /><br />As only one example, Gruntman expends virtually no effort asking the question--why rocketry for spaceflight?--when other possibilities existed. We know that Robert Goddard explored many possibilities for access to space--shooting a capsule from a large cannon, atomic power, high altitude balloons to the edge of space, etc.--before deciding that rockets were the only practical means. There have been others who question the method of rocketry for reaching space since then, and such concepts as the space elevator are modern reconceptualizations of the problem. Unfortunately, Gruntman expends little effort in exploring alternative possibilities and conveying the richness of the subject by emphasizing the relentless march of progress he views in rocket technology.<br /><br />Even so, this is a massively impressive work that will be of real use to a large community of scholars. It will find use for years to come. I applaud Mike Gruntman for undertaking this effort and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics for publishing it. \\"Blazing the Trail\\" offers an important consideration of the state of knowledge about this subject and will serve as a good starting point for further investigations.clusion of any social or cultural factors that might have influenced the engineers.<br /><br />As only one example, Gruntman expends virtually no effort asking the question--why rocketry for spaceflight?--when other possibilities existed.

Huntington's entire thesis, everyone should recognize that \\"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\\" is an exceptionally important book that deserves wide readership and sustained debate. I find it a thoughtful and provocative thesis that helps explain much that has taken place in international relations in the last fifteen years.<br /><br />Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington presents a powerful thesis to explain what has happened in the world since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war. The thrust of Huntington's argument rejects the notion that the world will inevitably succumb to Western values that seemed so triumphant in the early 1990s. On the contrary, Huntington contends that the West's influence in the world is waning because of growing resistance to its values and the reassertion by non-Westerners of their own cultures. He argues that the world will see in the twenty-first century an increasing threat of violence arising from renewed conflicts among countries and cultures basing their identities on long-held traditions. This argument moves past the notion of ethnicity to examine the growing influence of a handful of major cultures--Western, Orthodox, Latin American, Islamic, Japanese, Chinese, Hindu, and African--in current struggles across the globe. In so doing, Huntington successfully shifts the discussion of the post-cold war world from ideology, ethnicity, politics, and economics to culture--especially to the religious basis of culture. Huntington rightly warns against facile generalizations about the world becoming one, so common in the early 1990s, and points out the resilience of civilizations to foreign secular influences.<br /><br />Huntington asserts that there are nine major civilizations in the post-1990 era. The dominant civilization at present is the \\"West,\\" characterized by the United States, Canada, and the nations of Western Europe. There are also Latin American, African, Islamic, Sinic (Chinese), Hindu, Orthodox (Russia and other Slavic nations), Buddhist, and Japanese civilizations. Each has different traditions, priorities, and institutions. Each also misunderstands the other civilizations of the world. In the post-cold war era, no matter how seemingly desperate confrontations within these civilizations may seem--such as the trials over northern Ireland--they have little potential for escalation beyond the civilization in which they occur. Confrontations among civilizations, however, have a great potential to escalate into large conflagrations, including world wars. The civilizations capable of forming meaningful ties to other civilizations, creating alliances not just for defensive purposes but also as a means of broadening engagement, have the greatest possibility for thriving in this new international arena. The West, Huntington believes, should give up the idea of exporting its values and expand the possibility of its survival through stronger alliances with other civilizations.<br /><br />I believe this is an intriguing idea that requires consideration in my own work on the history of spaceflight. For example, the International Space Station (ISS), being constructed by the United States with 16 other nations, represents the largest and most complex international peacetime activity in history. While the space station has been sold as a means of undertaking pathbreaking scientific research, that may not be the most important reason for supporting it. At a fundamental level, as Huntington points out, the geopolitical system of the post-cold war era requires its continuation and the establishment of other large-scale international programs that enhance engagement with other civilizations.<br /><br />While difficult, it is exceedingly necessary, especially in a post September 11th world. One is reminded of the quote from Wernher von Braun in 1960, \\"we can lick gravity, but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming.\\" Perhaps the hardest part of spaceflight is not the scientific and technological challenges of operating in an exceptionally foreign and hostile environment but in the down-to-Earth environment of rough-and-tumble international and domestic politics. But even so, cooperative space endeavors have been richly rewarding and overwhelmingly useful, from all manner of scientific, technical, social, and political perspectives. This is especially true of the ISS, which has helped stabilize relations with many other nations, and therefore mitigates some of the divisiveness that Huntington perceives in this clash of civilizations. Just as surely as the Apollo program helped the United States ensure its place as a leader of the world in the cold war, the International Space Station serves a critical international role in the post-cold war world.<br /><br />In the clash of civilizations of the twenty-first century, the ISS offers a testbed for civilizational alliances along the lines that Huntington identifies. From the beginning the West adopted the project and brought in a second great civilization in Japan. In 1993 the Orthodox civilization, using Huntington's terminology for Russia and other Slavic peoples, joined the program. Perhaps the difficulty of working with the Russians has been largely the result of these strikingly different civilizations. Brazil and other nations of the Latin American civilization also want to join the program, as does India. China has also made overtures about the desire to become a part of the ISS effort. Despite the very real challenges that would result from incorporating these new partners into the program, their inclusion would advance the cause of creating alliances with other civilizations. This could serve ultimately as a means of closing the gap between nations rather than widening it. At a fundamental level, the International Space Station may serve the larger objectives of American foreign policy better than many other initiatives that offer fewer prospects for success.<br /><br />In the end, Huntington has offered a framework from which to analyze recent historical developments that are applicable across a broad spectrum, including the history of space exploration. I highly recommend this book as a departure point for further study about the post-cold war world.rk is overwhelming.\\" Perhaps the hardest part of spaceflight is not the scientific and technological challenges of operating in an exceptionally foreign and hostile environment but in the down-to-Earth environment of rough-and-tumble international and domestic politics.

From the mythology of ancient Greece through the ages to the present we have sought limitless life. Stories of vampires, for instance, are in part predicated on the quest for eternal life. So is the story of Frankenstein. But Sidney Perkowitz, professor of physics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, demonstrates in this important new book written for a general audience that the quest has taken the form of androids, robots, and cyborgs for millennia. For example, Talos of Greek myth was a bronze automaton created by Hephaestus. More recently, fiction has given us robots, cyborgs, and replicants that all demonstrated this quest for immortality. For the first time modern science has created the possibility that the bionic human might be possible in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />After an introduction that suggests that androids are all around us, Perkowitz divides his study into two parts--\\"Artificial Beings: Meaning and History\\" and \\"How Far Along are We?\\"--and proceeds to discuss the evolution of the quest for eternal life and the possibilities that exist at the present. In the process he argues that humans have always been bionic from the point that they picked up the first stick and used it as a club to the ultimate merging of humans and machines in cyborgian symbiosis. We see this all the time with artificial body parts made for amputees or hip or knee or other replacements. We also see it with pacemakers and diabetic pumps and hearing aids and eyeglasses.<br /><br />Perkowitz believes that this is just the beginning of the merging of human and machines and finds the possibilities for the future truly exciting. He does envision serious moral and ethical concerns that require concentrated and long-term consideration. He does not, however, envision any way of stopping this inexorable movement toward ever-greater symbiosis between living beings and technology.<br /><br />The quest for a bionic person is well underway in laboratories around the world and Perkowitz takes us on a tour of some of the most inventive people and places, ranging from Rodney Brooks and Cynthia Breazeal at MIT to the Honda Corporation lab to the ROBODEX 2003 exposition where the latest ideas on robotics found expression. There is, in Perkowitz's thinking, a critical mass driving humanity toward a new and different level of life and consciousness. Science is exploiting fast developing knowledge of materials, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and molecular biology to move toward the creation of ever more complex machines that look and act like people. At the same time scientists are incorporating into humans more and more technology to enhance the quality and longevity of life.<br /><br />As written on the dust jacket of \\"Digital People\\": \\"In short, we are going beyond what was once the stuff of books and films to create genuine bionic people with fully integrated artificial components--and it will not be long before we reach the ultimate goal of constructing a completely synthetic human-like being.\\" Perkowitz asks, will this step lead to reinterpretations of the meaning of life and debase the human spirit? As text on the dustjacket indicates: \\"Certainly this God-like ability brings us face-to-face with a host of troubling spiritual, ethical, and legal dilemmas.\\"<br /><br />This is a stimulating book, one that educates and provokes and questions all at the same time.

Martin Distinguished Professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Maryland and current curator for aerodynamics at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum established himself as the preeminent interpreter of the history of flight technology in the United States. This book solidifies Anderson's stature with its outstanding analysis of the evolution of the airplane from its origins before the Wright brothers through the design revolution wrought by the advent of jet propulsion.<br /><br />Anderson begins with an introduction that serves as chapter 1. He then offers six additional chapters chronologically exploring the development of aeronautics. These include: (2) aeronautical thought and research before the nineteenth century, (3) work during the nineteenth century but before the Wright brothers, (4) the efforts of the Wrights and their revolutionary Flyer, (5) the era of the strut-and-wire biplane which Anderson characterizes as \\"seat-of-the-pants\\" design, (6) the development of the mature propeller-driven airplane which the author considers the first design revolution, (7) and the second design revolution wrought by jet propulsion.<br /><br />This work is written for the general reader, and Anderson does a fine job of communicating difficult concepts without reliance on jargon and a plethora of equations. There are a few of the latter, but they are kept to a minimum and the author takes pains to explain them clearly. This is also a large format book well illustrated with diagrams and photographs that do much than just decorate the text by serving to illustrate the principles of flight.<br /><br />Anderson also does a good job of demonstrating the state of the art of flight at critical points in the evolution of the airplane. For example, while most people believe that Wilbur and Orville Wright \\"invented\\" the airplane, Anderson shows that the idea of the airplane predated them by centuries and that they inherited a considerable body of knowledge about the principles of flight. This, and their own work, enabled the Wrights to fly the first successful airplane. Others following in their footsteps significantly advanced knowledge about the technology of flight and brought us to the point we are now. Always, Anderson explores the evolution of the major technologies required for flight: aerodynamics, materials and structures, propulsion, guidance and control, and the systems and processes that guide the development of any airplane.<br /><br />While there are no footnotes in the text, there is a bibliography and Anderson often refers to specific publications in his text. Prepared in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of powered flight, this is quite an excellent work and highly recommended..

Is the next phase of human evolution the merging of humans and machines? Or perhaps, are we humans already merged with machines and have we been for centuries? These and other questions are ones that occupy Andy Clark, director of the Cognitive Science Program at Indiana University and author of this thought-provoking book written for an informed but lay audience. Clark makes the case that long before cyborgs became the villains of so many popular films--the \\"Terminator\\" and \\"Matrix\\" series, \\"Blade Runner,\\" and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" come immediately to mind--humans had become inextricably linked to machines in a way that ensured that they could not survive without them. Accordingly, even without electronic implants Homo Sapiens are cyborgs, and have been as far back as the first time one of our ancestors picked up a tree limb and used it as club. Clark argues that the human-technology symbiosis is totally natural and has been for millennia. The speed with which the merging of human and machine is advancing expanded greatly in the twentieth century as such technologies as pacemakers, artificial hips and knees, prosthetics, and other electronic implants have enhanced and sometimes prolonged the lives of millions of people.<br /><br />Andy Clark explores this increasingly close relationship of humans and machines--the \\"cyborg-ization\\" of humanity--in eight chapters. Beginning with the argument that we are already cyborgs dependent for our lifestyle on all manner of technologies, he moves through a succession of possible steps into the future that will find us more and more closely tied to the technologies we have created. Eventually, we will reach a post-human state. Rather than invoking fear that we will become non-human, Clark celebrates this possibility and the wondrous potentialities it offers. He urges caution in this transition, for not all possibilities are desirable, but generally Clark is optimistic. He asks: \\"if it is our basic human nature to annex, exploit, and incorporate nonbiological stuff deep into our mental profiles [and he firmly believes that it is]--then the question is not whether we go that route, but in what ways we actively sculpt and shape it. By seeing ourselves as we truly are, we increase the chances that our future biotechnological unions will be good ones\\" (p. 198).<br /><br />In my own research concerning the past, present, and possible future of spaceflight, I find much in Andy Clark's study that is useful. One of the truly fascinating developments associated with the rise of robotic capabilities is the possibility of post-human migration. In fulfilling the spacefaring dream, the intelligent life to leave Earth and colonize the galaxy may not be entirely human in form. Extensive discussions have taken place in recent years on the relationship between artificial computer intelligence, biotechnology, and human evolution. In spite of its obvious relevance to space travel, little of this has been extended to outer space. The early space pioneer Robert H. Goddard suspected that humans might be obliged to transport genetic material to distant stars rather than go themselves. The rigors of galactic flight that will likely confine humans to the inner solar system might not confine our machines. Given the great difficulties of interstellar flight, these would have to be machines with human-like intelligence or even possibly humans reengineered to withstand long-duration space travel. The possibilities are truly amazing and somewhat weird, and as remote today from common experience as were the early images of space travel to the people who first envisioned them centuries ago. Nonetheless, they are not wholly impossible. Given current directions in technology as envisioned by such authors as Andy Clark, a post-biological galaxy teeming with enhanced human intelligence is not beyond the realm of possibility. In one such vision, biological species become so technologically proficient that they cease to exist in purely biological form. The possibilities for post-human evolution has the potential to radically alter the dominant paradigm of human spaceflight.<br /><br />\\"Natural-Born Cyborgs\\" is a challenging and useful book.

Using the tools of postmodern analysis of texts, and the deconstruction of ideas, institutions, and forms scholars have reshaped our understanding of everything from the mundane to subjects acknowledged by all as critical to our modern society. In this important book Henry Jenkins turns his considerable analytic skills on the role of television fans in adopting and making their own several important series and movies. Jenkins, on the faculty of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, writes both as a scholar and a fan fully immersed in the culture that produces conventions and a wide range of artistic products associated with television.<br /><br />\\"Textual Poachers\\" emphasizes how fans of various television shows and movies have embraced the characters and \\"universe\\" of the shows and made them their own. In most cases they participate in the continuing saga of the characters of the story by fashioning their own narratives based on the series. Be far the most famous of these participatory series is \\"Star Trek,\\" which was the first series to attract this type of fan following, and still the largest of all of them. It has spawned not only multi and varied clubs for those interested in the ideals of the series, but also inspired a range of creative responses in art, literature, costume, engineering, erotica, music, and drama. In so doing, those that are a part of the fan culture of the series emphasize the interplay of the crew \\"family\\" aboard the Star Ship Enterprise, the ideals of the United Federation of Planets, and the challenges of moving beyond the humdrum of existence on Earth to a more exciting and rewarding life within the broader cosmos. The ranges of responses are almost as broad as the number of people involved, and Henry Jackson makes clear that all of those responses are legitimate in the \\"universe\\" of fandom.<br /><br />Jenkins writes at length about the responses of fans to several television programs beyond the famous \\"Star Trek\\" phenomenon. These include \\"Alien Nation\\" (1989-1990), \\"Dr. Who,\\" (1963- ), \\"Magnum, P.I.\\" (1980-1988); \\"The Man from Uncle\\" (1964-1968), \\"Remington Steele\\" (1982-1987), \\"Simon and Simon\\" (1981-1988), \\"Twin Peaks\\" (1990-1991), and others. But the series fans that Jenkins spends the most time analyzing are those attracted to \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" (1987-1990). The romance between Catherine (Linda Hamilton) and Vincent (Ron Perlman) captured the imagination of a larger number of viewers and they used that on-screen relationship as the cultural materials from which they created a vast array of \\"stories, songs, videos, and social interactions.\\" It proved a powerful inspiration for enormously romantic depictions.<br /><br />Henry Jenkins also draws attention to the fact that the vast majority of those a part of this fandom, are white, middle-class women seeking something more than they experience in their everyday lives. They seem drawn to television series with compelling characters interacting in a sophisticated manner. They emphasize relationships and tend to soft-pedal action and adventure in their formulations. At sum they seem to be creating through their efforts a place of refuge, acceptance, and intimacy for themselves and their co-participants. This is captured well in a song, \\"In My Weekend-Only World,\\" written by T.J. Burnside Clapp to express her love of the fan conventions that she attends:<br /><br />\\"In an hour of make-believe<br /><br />In these warm convention halls<br /><br />My mind is free to think<br /><br />And feels so deeply<br /><br />An intimacy never found<br /><br />Inside their silent walls<br /><br />In a year or more<br /><br />Of what they call reality.<br /><br />In my weekend-only world,<br /><br />That they call make-believe,<br /><br />Are those who share<br /><br />The visions that I see.<br /><br />In theirreal-time life<br /><br />That they tell me is real,<br /><br />The things they care about<br /><br />Aren't real to me.\\" (p. 277)<br /><br />Henry Jenkins' study is a superb analysis that will change the perspective all who read it about the fan culture and its place in modern society. It is difficult not to emerge from reading this book without a sense of wonder about the talented individuals who are a part of this fan culture and how they seek to live their lives on their own terms, in the process creating for themselves idealized \\"universes\\" more like those they glimpsed in the television fictions that they embrace.r />The things they care about <br />Aren't real to me.\\" (p. 277) <br /> <br />Henry Jenkins' study is a superb analysis that will change the perspective all who read it about the fan culture and its place in modern society.

Harland, goes far toward capturing the essence of the shuttle's place in that history. It is an important contribution to the historical literature of the Space Shuttle and its uses.<br /><br />In many respects the idea of a reusable Space Shuttle dates at least to the theoretical rocketplane studies of the 1930s by Austrian aerospace designer, Eugen S&auml;nger. By the 1950s it had become an integral part of Wernher von Braun's master plan for space exploration: an orderly set of stages aimed at creating a permanent space station serviced from the Earth by a reusable winged vehicle or shuttle, leading to a colony on the Moon, and finally undertaking a human expedition to Mars. This model gained increased legitimacy in the 1968 feature film, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" in which the stunningly picturesque wheeled space station was reached from Earth by a winged, reusable space shuttle.<br /><br />These were the ideals that motivated NASA engineers in the 1960s, as they pursued the dream of a permanent presence in space, made sustainable by a reusable winged vehicle providing routine access to space at an affordable price. Some NASA officials compared the methods of launching into orbit used on Project Apollo to operating a railroad and then throwing away the locomotive after every trip. A reusable Space Shuttle, they argued, would make the trip much more cost effective. Studies NASA conducted in the mid-1960s found that reusable space technology was within reasonable grasp, more evolutionary than revolutionary, and that a hefty investment of research and development funds could yield a substantial reduction in operations costs. Flying thirty or more times a year, such a system would be an economical alternative to the use of large \\"throw away\\" launchers like the Saturn V. All of the spacefaring nations of the world have eventually accepted that paradigm as the raison d'être of their human space flight efforts in the latter twentieth century.<br /><br />The goal of efficient operations in a heavy-lift booster--especially with the decision for budgetary reasons to terminate the Saturn V booster production line in mid-1968 after the completion of fifteen launch vehicles--prompted NASA's commitment to the Space Shuttle as a continuation vehicle for human space flight. Once it was underway, NASA leaders believed, they could also move forward with a space station, which the Space Shuttle could both place in orbit and support logistically. In addition, and this was in part serendipity from the NASA perspective, because of the Space Shuttle's size and versatility a portion of its payload bay could be used to haul scientific and applications satellites of all types into orbit for all users. The Space Shuttle was to be, essentially, the achievement of one-size-fits-all, in this instance the vehicle providing all orbital services required by users. This type of standardization has long been an important part of American mass production, the Model-T automobile and the F-111 fighter-bomber being examples of how it was supposed to work.<br /><br />Although the development program was risky, between 1972-when President Nixon approved the effort--and 1981--when the first orbital flight took place-a talented group of scientists and engineers worked to create the world's first reusable space vehicle. Since that first flight the various orbiters--Atlantis, Columbia (lost on February 1, 2003 during reentry, Discovery, Endeavour, and Challenger (lost in 1986 during the only Space Shuttle accident ever to take place)-have made more than 100 flights into space. Throughout, the vehicle has been a workhorse of space exploration for projects both international and domestic. The Space Shuttle has launched numerous scientific satellites, including the Magellan spacecraft to Venus, the Galileo probe to Jupiter, and the international Ulysses spacecraft to study the Sun. Each also undertook scientific and technological experiments ranging from the release of experiments into space, through the continued flights of the European Space Agency's \\"Spacelab,\\" to a dramatic three-person EVA in 1992 to retrieve a satellite and bring it back to Earth for repair. The shuttle also has deployed the Gamma Ray Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. It has also demonstrated its usefulness in two complicated servicing missions of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993 and 1997.<br /><br />Between April 1981 and the end of 1997, the Space Shuttle carried approximately 2.3 million pounds of cargo and more than 750 major payloads into orbit, including more than 300 for NASA, more than 140 for the Department of Defense, and more than 100 for commercial interests. Through 1997, astronaut crews have also conducted more than 50 extravehicular activities (EVA) and Shuttle crews are actively preparing for the EVAs necessary to build the International Space Station in orbit beginning in late 1998. Through all of these activities, a good deal of realism about what the Space Shuttle can and cannot do has now emerged.<br /><br />At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Space Shuttle enjoys the same plaudits and suffers from the same criticisms that have been present since not long after the program began. It remains the only vehicle in the world with the dual capability to deliver and return large payloads to and from orbit. The design, now more than two decades old, is in need of replacement. The failure to do so, as seen in the loss of Columbia, represents the single most significant failure of leadership in the history of the space program.<br /><br />David M. Harland's important study of the Space Shuttle fills in many of the details of its myriad uses over its operational life. It provides an overview of the variety of missions and the unique capabilities of this remarkable machine. As such, it is one of the critical building blocks in the furtherance of historical knowledge about the history of the Space Age and the place of NASA and the Space Shuttle in it.

Logsdon's \\"The Decision to Go to the Moon: Project Apollo and the National Interest\\" is THE classic study of the process whereby U.S. President John F. Kennedy reached the decision to support an effort to land Americans on the Moon by the end of the 1960s. First published at the time the Apollo program was in the midst of landing six missions on the Moon in 1970, the book has now been out of print for many years. I certainly wish that it were readily available again, but Dr. Logsdon does not want it to appear again without revision since he understands that many additional documentary sources and perspectives should inform it. I cannot disagree with that assessment, as I point out in the discussion below. As it is, Dr. Logsdon is at work on a new study of the space policy of the Kennedy administration that promises to be a seminal contribution to the subject. I wish him the best with that work and look forward to its appearance.<br /><br />Even though now more than 30 years old, \\"The Decision to Go to the Moon\\" may still be read with great profit, and no serious student of the history of U.S. spaceflight can ignore it. In this work Logsdon argues that Kennedy's decision in favor of Project Apollo stemmed from a series of politically inopportune incidents that included the aborted Bay of Pigs invasion and Yuri Gagarin's historic first flight into space in April 1961. In responding to what seemed to be unending humiliations in the new space frontier, Kennedy sought to formulate an ambitious but realistic response to the Soviet challenge. On May 25, 1961, after extensive consultations with his advisors, Kennedy announced the goal of sending Americans to the Moon before the end of the decade. By synthesizing the disparate threads of the events of 1961 using primary documentation, Logsdon laid the groundwork for understanding a critical event in U.S. space policy, and thus built the foundation for a new interpretive space policy history. The author touts the decision-making to press Project Apollo as the public policy process at its best. It allowed consensus building and consensus maintaining, and finally accomplishment of the goal.<br /><br />Logsdon argues in this important book that Kennedy made a single, rational, pragmatic choice to undertake the U.S. sprint to the Moon as a means of competing with the Soviet Union. It was war by other means, and a way to enhance U.S. international prestige during the height of the Cold War. The president and his advisors, therefore, undertook an exceptionally deliberate, reasonable, judicious, and logical process to define the problem, analyze the situation, develop a response, and achieve a consensus for action. The timeline progressed from point to point with no cul-de-sacs and few detours from problem definition to sensible decision. It was all so neat and tidy!<br /><br />This rational choice argument begins with the assertion that JFK's space policy was a relic of the Cold War struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union, and that it revolved around the question of international prestige. In this view, Apollo was a clear result of competition between the world's two superpowers to win the \\"minds of men\\" to a specific economic and political system. In essence, the Apollo program was nothing less than the \\"moral equivalent of war.\\" It sought to weaken the Soviet Union while enhancing the United States.<br /><br />There is much to recommend Logsdon's interpretation and its study as a model of outstanding policy formulation is appropriate. A year after the Apollo decision, Kennedy himself sounded this approach when he noted that he perceived only three ways that the United States could effectively compete with the Soviet Union: militarily, economically, and technologically. He eliminated the first option because no one desired nuclear war. The second option was unattractive because it would take a long time for a clear economic winner to emerge. Apollo was a logical option because the winner would be readily apparent to the entire world within a few years, and since the payoff on the decision came nearly a decade later the United States would have sufficient time to overcome any obstacles that might impede efforts. The main strength of the rational choice model, however, is its emphasis on Kennedy's Apollo decision as a politically pragmatic one that solved a number of significant problems for his administration. The American effort to land on the Moon, therefore, served as an enormously effective response to a Cold War crisis with the Soviet Union.<br /><br />At the same time, the most significant problem with this interpretation is its unwavering belief that individuals--and especially groups of individuals, even competing ones--logically assess situations and respond with totally reasonable consensus actions. Since virtually nothing in human existence is done solely on a rational basis this is a very difficult conclusion to accept. Charles E. Lindblom (\\"The Science of `Muddling Through',\\" Public Administration Review 19 (1959): 79-88) wrote 45 years ago that the \\"science of `muddling through'\\" is perhaps as useful an alternative approach to the study of decision-making as any, recognizing that \\"policy is not made once and for all; it is made and re-made endlessly.\\" There may have been more \\"muddling through\\" in the Apollo decision of 1961 than suggested in \\"The Decision to Go to the Moon.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps so, but John Logsdon's book is still a powerful and seminal study of a defining moment in the history of the Space Age.

The answer to the question, of course, is that democracies can and do, but the analysis here suggests that the political requirement to build broad constituencies and to water down proposals to ensure success, as well as to make claims that are beyond reach, ensure that the effort is inefficient and incremental and always shifting rather than focused and accepting of returns that will accrue beyond the next election.

It is an entertaining and interesting analysis of the cause of planetary space exploration written by a brilliant iconoclast in the space science community. Murray's ideas are always fascinating to consider, and his running critique on the role of humans versus robots in space exploration is certainly worth considering. This book is divided into five parts starting with the search for life on Mars, and continuing through \\"Probing Warmer Worlds,\\" Voyager and the Grandest Tour Ever,\\" \\"Lost in Space,\\" \\"Comet Tales,\\" and a reprise on returning to Mars. In each section Murray brings his hard-edged perspective and sometimes biting wit to trace the evolution of planetary exploration between the 1950s and 1980s. I will comment on two very interesting aspects of this book.<br /><br />The first is the section that Murray writes at the beginning of the book on the longstanding human fascination of the possibility of life on Mars that Percival Lowell ignited and that culminated in the Viking landers on Mars in 1976. After years of belief that Mars might harbor life, the Viking landings demonstrated that the prospects for discovering extraterrestrial life had been oversold. Murray explains here that the Viking landers had been ballyhooed as a definite means of ascertaining whether or not life existed on Mars. The public expected to find it, and probably so did many of the scientists, and what would happen when hopes were dashed? Murray argued that \\"the extraordinarily hostile environment revealed by the Mariner flybys made life there so unlikely that public expectations should not be raised.\\" Carl Sagan, who fully expected to find something there, accused Murray of pessimism. Murray asserted that Sagan was far too optimistic. And the two publicly jousted over how to treat the Viking mission. Murray, as well as other politically savvy scientists and public intellectuals, argued that the legacy of failure to detect life, despite billions spent on research since the beginning of the space age and over-optimistic statements that a breakthrough was just around the corner, would spark public disappointment and perhaps an outrage manifested in reduced public funding for the effort (pp. 61, 68-69, 74, 77). Murray seems to have been right, for after the Viking missions the U.S. did not send another probe to Mars until the 1990s.<br /><br />Second, Murray is at his best in charting the bobs and weaves, ebbs and flows of space science politics in relation to the human spaceflight agenda of NASA. Without question, NASA's emphasis has been on human spaceflight--it consumes approximately half of the NASA budget every year--and the planetary exploration agenda must always be cognizant of this overarching priority. As the Space Shuttle came on line in the early 1980s, the planetary exploration program constantly fell sway to the shuttle's priorities. The NASA budget reflected the importance of the shuttle program, and the need to launch everything on the shuttle prompted the reconfiguration of planetary probes for that requirement. Murray makes numerous comments on this subject. He wrote that his planetary missions were constantly challenged by the shuttle, as NASA's dollars were poured into a development program which lagged behind schedule and over budget. He refers to the shuttle as NASA's \\"sacred cow\\" which always has to be fed despite any other worthwhile projects that went begging. This was especially true during the early 1980s when the shuttle was first starting to fly and the Reagan administration was intent on cutting government expenditures. In essence, Murray concludes, the shuttle priority ensured that the United States would have no mission to Halley's Comet when it reached Earth in 1986. Moreover, while itproved and enormously significant mission, what became the Galileo probe to Jupiter was constantly reconfigured for shuttle launch, each time increasing costs and compromising the quality of the science.<br /><br />Murray ends his book with a reconsideration of Mars exploration, but this time with other nations. Writing in 1989, just as the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, he foresaw some of the cooperative efforts that became the norm for spaceflight in the 1990s and later.<br /><br />This is an important book, and one that is very useful for any who wishing to understand the nature of planetary exploration since the dawn of the space age. Too bad that it is out of print. Fortunately, there are several second hand copies available at reasonable prices. Buy them and read Murray's analysis. It is well worth the time and energy.e it proved and enormously significant mission, what became the Galileo probe to Jupiter was constantly reconfigured for shuttle launch, each time increasing costs and compromising the quality of the science. <br /> <br />Murray ends his book with a reconsideration of Mars exploration, but this time with other nations.

Webb of NASA (New Series in NASA History)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	An Outstanding Administrative Biography of a NASA Legend	This is an excellent biography of James E. Webb (1906-1992), NASA administrator between 1961 and 1968, the critical period in which Project Apollo was underway. During his tenure NASA developed the modern techniques necessary to coordinate and direct the most unique and complex technological enterprise in human history, the sending of human beings to the Moon and bringing them safely back to the Earth.<br />Political scientist W. Henry Lambright focuses here on the biography of a stellar public administrator. He finds that Webb, a North Carolinian with a thick southern accent that charmed all and helped to hide a steel trap mind, was well-prepared for guiding NASA during this critical era because of his place as a Federal government insider well-versed in the bobs and weaves, ins and outs of New Deal Washington and the highest echelons of the Democratic Party.<br />Coming to Washington in 1932, Webb served as secretary to Representative Edward W. Pou of the 4th North Carolina District and Chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee until 1934. He then went to work in the law office of O. Max Gardner, attorney and former Governor of South Carolina, in Washington, D.C., between 1934 and 1936. He then moved to the private sector, eventually rising to vice president of the Sperry Gyroscope Company, before entering the U.S. Marine Corps in 1944. After World War II, Webb returned to Washington and served as Executive Assistant to Max Gardner, by then Under Secretary of the Treasury, before being named as Director of the Bureau of the Budget in the Executive Office of the President, a position he held until 1949. President Harry S Truman then asked Webb to serve as Under Secretary of State. When the Truman administration ended early in 1953, Webb left Washington for a position in the Kerr-McGee Oil Corp. in Oklahoma.<br />James Webb returned to Washington on February 14, 1961, when he accepted the position of administrator of NASA. Webb's long experience in Washington paid handsomely during his years at NASA, where he lobbied for federal support for the space program and dealt with competing interests on Capitol Hill and in the White House. His career changed fundamentally after May 25, 1961, when President John F. Kennedy announced that the United States would commit itself to landing an American on the Moon before the end of the decade. For seven years after Kennedy's 1961 lunar landing announcement, through October 1968, James Webb politicked, coaxed, cajoled, and maneuvered for NASA in Washington. The longtime Washington insider proved a master at bureaucratic politics. In the end, through a variety of methods Administrator Webb built a seamless web of political liaisons that brought continued support for and resources to accomplish the Apollo Moon landing on the schedule Kennedy had announced. He left NASA in October 1968, just as Apollo was nearing a successful completion.<br />All of this is detailed in Lambright's excellent book. Once reading it, everyone will understand the book's title, \\"Powering Apollo,\\" which Webb did with brilliant political leadership.<br />Lambright deals extensively with the most difficult challenge faced by Webb, the Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967 that killed astronauts Gus Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee. As shock gripped the nation during the days that followed, Webb told the media, \\"We've always known that something like this was going to happen sooner or later....who would have thought that the first tragedy would be on the ground?\\"<br />Webb took the brunt of public criticism for the accident, and went before various congressional committees and took a personal grilling every time. His answers were sometimes evasive and always defensive. The New York Times said that under Webb NASA stood for \\"Never a Straight Answer.\\" While the ordeal was personally taxing, whether by happenstance or design Webb deflected much of the backlash over the fire from both NASA as an agency and from theadministration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. While he was personally tarred with the disaster, the space agency's image and popular support were largely undamaged. Webb himself never recovered from the stigma of the fire, Lambright notes, and when he left NASA in October 1968, even as Apollo was nearing a successful completion, few mourned his departure.<br />In all, this is an outstanding administrative biography of Jim Webb, still by far NASA's most significant administrator, although some-Daniel S. Goldin and James M. Fletcher (when his two appointments are counted together)-have served longer. \\"Powering Apollo\\" is must reading for anyone seeking to understand the Apollo program.e administration of President Lyndon B.

As the chief historian of NASA at the time I saw the anniversary looming before us like a freight train bearing down on a deer crossing. I knew it would consume the history function, but I also wanted to use the anniversary to gain support for substantive history projects. This was one of several publications that were completed using resources made available because of the anniversary, and I am quite pleased with the result. The book was originally published through the Government Printing Office as NASA Special Publication-4223 in 1999, and received the Pendleton Prize for best documentary work from the Society for History in the Federal Government. We later negotiated its reprinting in paperback from the University Press of Florida.<br />Glen E. Swanson, then the historian at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, included in this work fourteen interviews that sweep the broad expanse of the history of Apollo. It includes some of the most well-known people in the history of spaceflight, such as Wernher von Braun and Moon-walkers Charlie Duke and Harrison Schmidt, as well as some folks who have escaped the spotlight, such as Geneva Barnes who helped the Apollo 11 crew on their worldwide goodwill tour after their mission. It also includes some unsung, but nonetheless significant figures. My favorite example is Robert Gilruth, director of the Manned Spacecraft Center (renamed the Johnson Space Center in 1973) and without question the godfather to the astronauts. All of the interviews published here, by both well-known and lesser-known figures are excellently edited and made available in a very accessible text.<br />Glen Swanson had literally hundreds of interviews from which to choose, for NASA has been sponsoring oral histories of its personnel for decades. \\"Life\\" magazine writer Robert Sherrod, who had intended to write a book on Apollo, moreover, conducted some of those included. He never completed the book, but he donated all of his research material to the NASA History Office and it is a treasure trove useful to anyone interested in Apollo. His copies of documents and oral histories have a prized place in the NASA collection. And anyone may use them at any time. In addition, the Johnson Space Center has sponsored an oral history program for many years and has a wealth of materials from which Swanson drew the best. Other collections of oral histories also reside at Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, where it went when I left NASA in 2002. These collections made it possible for this book to be published. There is also grist for similar oral history treatments of other NASA programs contained in these rich collections. For anyone who might have an interest in the NASA oral history program I wrote the following article on the subject that you may want to review, \\"`We can lick gravity, but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming': NASA, Oral History, and the Contemporary Past,\\" Oral History Review 30 (Summer/Fall 2003): 111-28.<br />Swanson provided a biographical sketch before each interview included in this book, with details about its origins, dates, interviewers, and where one might consult the original document. I tried to provide some historical context on the Apollo program in an introduction. We then compiled an annotated bibliography on the program to aid in further reading. Always, we sought to bring to life the history of what was arguably humanity's great voyage of discovery.<br />I believe Swanson succeeded admirably in his task. I also believe that anyone interested in the history of spaceflight or in oral history as a methodology will find this an engaging and helpful book.lo, moreover, conducted some of those included.

US	36818999	R1ADGCJFPUJI5R	0226354792	640841047	The Political Culture of the American Whigs	Books	5	23	24	N	N	Great Book on the Origins of the &quot;Positive Liberal State&quot;	In this book, originally published in 1979, Danial Walker Howe seeks to understand the ideological origins and development of American Whigs, a political party that emerged in the 1830s but collapsed in the first part of the 1850s. Led by such enigmatic politicians as Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, the Whigs captured two presidential elections--in 1840 and 1848--and a host of state governments. This excellent book takes a largely biographical approach toward analyzing the key aspects of the Whigs.<br />In the process, Howe overturns the long-held perspective that the Whigs were aristocratic, rational, paternalistic, and economically stolid. Those were characterizations, he argues, that their political rivals, the Jacksonian Democrats, assigned to the Whigs. He suggests that the Whigs should be viewed, instead, as a party trying to deal evenhandedly with myriad practical political problems. They believed in moderation, self-restraint, and a \\"rational persuasion\\" that helped create a balanced political order, economic growth, and social harmony. They also seemed to share an underlying conviction that the Jacksonians demonstrated little common sense in dealing with the most divisive issues of the antebellum era: economic concerns, race relations, class tensions, and sectional rivalries.<br />Historian Daniel Walker Howe has eloquently called the Whig Party the champions of \\"the positive liberal state,\\" which is arguably his most significant contribution to the reinterpretation of the Whigs. Howe wrote that \\"This ideal implied the belief that the state should actively seek `to promote the general welfare, raise the level of opportunity for all men, and aid all individuals to develop their full potentialities.' The Democrats, by contrast, believed in a `negative liberal state,' which left men free to pursue their own definition of happiness. A great advantage of this distinction between the parties is that it implies a connection between the economic and moral aspects of Whiggery. In both cases, the Whigs believed in asserting active control. They wanted `improvements,' both economic and moral, and they did not believe in leaving others alone\\" (p. 20). Perhaps the most persistent aspect of the Whig world view was the party's resoluteness in using political power for the furtherance of those ideals that it believed were valuable.<br />As Howe shows, the Whigs throughout their existence were optimistic about the prospect for the United States' economic progress, consolidation, and stabilization. As a group they adopted as an economic goal the creation of a mixed economy that made room for industry, trade, business, and agriculture; included entrepreneurs both large and small; and where bourgeoisie and proletariat and any other group could achieve justice and opportunity. They saw the need for government to foster the creation of both a climate and an infrastructure that would further that mixed economy. The establishment of a government bank with the power to regulate the money supply and the building of harbors, roads, and making other internal improvements were only two specific efforts to foster national economic growth and stability.<br />While some of the Whig economic programs were beneficial to only certain groups--such as a tariff directed at protecting American industry--other efforts advanced the fortunes of diverse groups. Through these efforts, the Whigs sought to bring order to the U.S. economy and to free it from dependency on the mercantilism of Europe. The Whig economic ideal was thus more inclusive than that held by the Jacksonian Democrats with their emphasis on agriculture, hard currency, and small business.<br />More than thinking on economics, Howe argues that the Whigs became a strong political party that could run closely with the Democrats in national elections only after they articulated their vision of American society and culture. Whereas, they were ever optimistic about the nation's economic prospects andcould devise legislation to help further it, they were always wary of the problems inherent in achieving social and moral balance. Inextricably tied to their conception of society was a sense that there was a commonality of interests between all Americans whether yeoman farmer or planter or factory worker or industrialist or professional. Pulling together to enlarge national wealth would, they argued, eventually help everyone. Equality of opportunity was thus a persistent theme in their rhetoric, as they urged the electorate to exhibit greater thrift, industry, productivity, and self-dependence.<br />The Whigs believed that inequity could be overcome only with greater moral rectitude and social responsibility. At the same time, the social structure of young America was viciously stirred by the Whig emphases on moral reform. In election after election, as well as in the workaday environment of the Congress and the state house, seemingly disparate issues ranging from banking to Indian removal were couched by the Whigs in the context of social reform.<br />This is a superb study of the American Whig party between the 1830s and 1850s. It helps to recast the structure of the political debate of the time while bringing to the fore the ideological origins and social context of this unique political party.could devise legislation to help further it, they were always wary of the problems inherent in achieving social and moral balance.

Bilstein, now retired from the University of Houston-Clear Lake. \\"Flight in America\\" is one of those exceptionally powerful syntheses that lays out a broad master narrative of the subject. Originally published in 1984, this work has now been through three editions, each refining and expanding the work to incorporate new understandings and broader perspectives. Indeed, \\"Flight in America\\" is THE place to start in any serious investigation of the development of air and space in the United States. Along with two other broad interpretive works-\\"Enterprise of Flight: The American Aviation and Aerospace Industry\\" (Smithsonian, 2001) and \\"Testing Aircraft, Exploring Space: An Illustrated History of NACA and NASA\\" (Johns Hopkins, 2003)-\\"Flight in America\\" offers a comprehensive narrative of the subject.<br />In this volume Bilstein progresses chronologically from the time of the Wright brothers, barnstorming, and early military aviation to the rise of aviation as a business, the advent of airlines, and the technological progress of the airplane. He then spend considerable effort discussing the role of the airplane in World War II before moving into post-war developments with jet airliners, global military reach made possible with aircraft, and the  beginning and development of the space age. In every sense, he offers a satisfying survey of aerospace issues that is useful both to students and scholars alike.<br />At a fundamental level, \\"Flight in America\\" represents an attempt to help coalesce a \\"New Aerospace History.\\" Like the \\"New Western History\\" or the \\"New Social History\\" that has been so important in the last twenty years, this approach represents a significant transformation that has largely been, although not exclusively, taking place in the field. Specifically, the \\"New Aerospace History\\" is committed to relating the subject to the larger issues of society, politics, and culture, taking a more sophisticated view of the technology than historians previously held. In the past, many writers on aerospace history held a fascination with the machinery, which has been largely anthropomorphized and often seen as \\"magical.\\"<br />The \\"New Aerospace History\\" embodied in this work moves beyond a fetish for the artifact to emphasize the broader role of the air- and spacecraft, and more importantly the whole technological system including not just the vehicle but also the other components that make up the aerospace climate, as an integral part of the human experience. This is not to be understood as lacking an interest in the artifact, or being artifactless. Rather it is an affirmation that one moves through reason and study to a larger understanding. It suggests that many unanswered questions are present in helping the development of modern flight, and that inquisitive individuals seek to know that which they do not understand. This assumption arises within historians and is based on their understanding of humans, for technological systems are constructions of the human mind or minds.<br />This work emphasizes, therefore, research in aerospace topics that are no longer limited to the vehicle-centered, internalist, style of history that had gone before. \\"Flight in America\\" offers all of us an opportunity to immerse ourselves in this truly challenging new approach to the field.

I can count on two hands the number of truly pathbreaking works of history published since 1980. \\"Rivers of Empire\\" is one of them, and must reading for anyone who seeks to understand the history of this critical region of the United States.<br />Donald Worster, Hall Distinguished Professor of American History at the University of Kansas, has been producing outstanding history of the American West and environmentalism for more than a quarter century. When the so-called \\"New Western History\\" was avant-garde in historian circles in the early 1980s he was dubbed one of the \\"Gang of Four\\" who transformed the field of study--the others being Patricia Nelson Limerick, William Cronen, and Richard White. Worster's work, as well as that of the other three historians, was indeed pathbreaking, and \\"Rivers of Empire: Water, Aridity, and the Growth of the American West\\" is by far his most influential publication. It demonstrates well why Worster was one of the \\"Gang of Four.\\"<br />In \\"Rivers of Empire\\" Worster argues that the core reality of the American West is its aridity. To make it suitable for large-scale human habitation required the complete transformation of the region; Americans harnessed the rivers and brought water there, irrigating the land and creating great cities. As Worster writes, \\"The ecological and social transformation of the Great Valley is one of the most spectacular, and more revealing episodes of the American West\\" (p. 11). The organization and structure of every institution associated with the West reflected the need to control the environment. It brought profound changes to both the region and the people who lived there. This is the story that he tells in this superb book.<br />Ironically, the supposed individualistic and democratic westerners willingly conspired with the government to create a hydraulic civilization under the suzerainty of the federal government. In order to flourish in the arid West Americans had to build an agricultural system that was dependent upon large-scale government-managed waterworks--productive (for irrigation) and protective (for flood control). This not only made the West habitable, it brought urbanization and wealth there as well. Ancient Egypt first engaged in this type of civilization, and became a dominant power in the process. But always, there were winners and losers in this situation and those left out harped on the inequities of the system. In the American West the \\"Sagebrush Revolution\\" of the latter twentieth century pitted the presumably individualist West against the organization and power of the federal government. Ironically, the very organization and power that had created the modern American West was under attack from those who had so benefited from it.<br />Worster notes that the dominant myth of the West needs to be replaced with a more realistic understanding. He asserts that it is best understood as a story \\"of people encountering difficult environments, of driving to overcome them through technological means, of creating the necessary social organization to do so, of leading on and on to indigenous bureaucracy and corporatism\\" (p. 11). He is so right.<br />This is a wonderful book. Don't miss it!as dependent upon large-scale government-managed waterworks--productive (for irrigation) and protective (for flood control).

I recently reread it to see if it still offered a useful overview of the subject. It does, despite the publication of David J. Weber's excellent \\"The Spanish Frontier in North America\\" (Yale University Press, 1992), which covers the same period and location and should be read in conjunction with Bannon's work. The Spanish borderlands was first denoted by Herbert Eugene Bolton, the great early twentieth century historian of the Spanish experience in North America, as the region originally settled by Spain but later incorporated into the United States. Bannon was one of his last students and the inheritor of his scholarly mantle.<br />\\"The Spanish Borderlands Frontier\\" presents a balanced and thorough history of Spanish exploration and settlement from Ponce de Leon's landing in 1513 to the end of Spain's North American empire in 1821. It is a magisterial textbook that presents an authoritative account of the Spanish colonial period in North America. It focuses largely on the political, economic, and religious activities of the borderlands, and always explores the relationship of the European conquerors to the Native American population. It takes a largely geographical approach, moving from region to region analyzing the development of the borderlands over time.<br />Father Bannon's work is still quite excellent and I applaud the University of New Mexico Press's decision to keep it in print more than thirty years after its original publication.

It is a revision of Hallion's &quot;On the Frontier: Flight Research at Dryden, 1946-1981&quot; (NASA SP-4303, 1984) with additional chapters and revisions to earlier material that bring the story up to date. It traces aerospace research and development activities at the site from the first establishment of the High Speed Flight Test Facility in 1946 through the recent X-38 and other projects. In addition to the updated 1984 text, there are three additional chapters written by Michael H. Gorn, many additional photographs, and a treasure trove of appendices that document flight programs, accidents, and budgets.<br />NASA began early in its history to publish a series of center histories that focused on the evolution of institutions and projects at its ten field centers. The 1984 edition of this work not only accomplished this task, but also contained an excellent account of the many exciting programs that had been conducted there, from Chuck Yeager's breaking of the sound barrier in 1947 with the X-1 through Scott Crossfield's Mach 2 flights with the D-558 through lifting body research and the famous X-15 program of 1958-1969. This book records the &quot;right stuff&quot; without the hyperbole of Tom Wolfe, in the process evoking even more awe for the men and women who advanced the frontiers of flight in the high desert of California.<br />Accordingly, as the NASA Chief Historian between 1990 and 2002 when the opportunity to update this text and publish it for a broader audience came I strongly encouraged it. While the book was not yet in print when I left NASA to assume new responsibilities at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, I could not be more pleased with the final product. The result is a very impressive book that I would commend to all who have an interest in flight research.

This book explores the rise of the film industry, concentrating on the experience in Hollywood, and offering an analysis of the changes in the industry wrought by technology (sound pictures, color, cinemascope), business (the studio system, contract players, star power, vertical integration), and culture (the meaning of films, the experience of the viewer).<br /><br />Author Thomas Cripps does an excellent job demonstrating the rise of the Hollywood oligopoly, and the alternatives that arose to that system but could never quite break its control. He expends considerable effort discussing various genres that arose before World War II, especially westerns and gangster films.<br /><br />The high point of Hollywood, at least according to many in the industry, was its effort in World War II to make films that were both entertaining and helpful to the war effort. Cripps discusses this activity from the Anglophillic \\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\\" (1939) through \\"Casablanca\\" (1942) to John Ford's semi-documentaries such as \\"They Were Expendable\\" (1945), as well as a host of other works. He also spends considerable effort unpacking the relationship of Hollywood to the Office of War Information (OWI) and finds that the Hollywood moguls, who had spent their careers answering to their moneyed overlords in New York, had little trouble answering to OWI communicators in Washington.<br /><br />Cripps concludes the book with a discussion of the collapse of the studio system after World War II. He explains that this took place because of several key issues. First, the suburbanization of America meant that moviegoers abandoned their downtown theaters and the current metroplexes did not emerge until much later. Second, the sudden rise in family development, sparking the advent of the baby boom, meant that these new families sought entertainment that was more private than the public gathering of the theater. Third, television arose and this gave these new families entertainment that they could partake of together in their homes. Finally, government antitrust action broke apart the vertical integration that had dominated the movie industry in the prewar era.<br /><br />Cripps also discusses the experience of the moviegoer in the theater throughout the first half of the twentieth century. He finds that the shared experience of sitting with others in a darkened theater partaking of exotic adventures, romances, historical and futuristic times, and the like provided a unique experience unavailable anywhere else. This experience profoundly affected how people embraced the movies as a central part of modern culture. Also overlaying the entire book is the issue of film censorship. The industry both self-regulated itself and had overseers who regulated it to create film that reinforced specific cultural and national values while discouraging mindsets and actions that went against the status quo.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book and one that I would recommend for those seeking to understanding this critical institution in twentieth century America.of the theater.

Historians of flight tend to concentrate on invention, research and development, test and evaluation, and the details of military or civil operations. Accordingly, there are good histories of the development of certain aircraft, such as the F-4, and good histories of its use as an instrument of air power in the American military. There is a failure, however, to explore and understand what really took place on the shop floor of McDonnell Aircraft Corporation as it built the F-4 fighter.<br />Roger Bilstein, retired from the University of Houston-Clear Lake, pulls back the curtain on this process in &quot;The Enterprise of Flight&quot; and offers an outstanding overview of a whole industry. He traces its rise from the first companies that designed and built canvas and wooden biplanes in the first part of the twentieth century to the behemoths that dominate the industry at the beginning of the twenty-first century. All the household corporate names in the community are discussed--Boeing, North American, Consolidated, McDonnell, Douglas, Martin, Curtis, Wright--as well as the tycoons that made this industry arise in the United States.<br />Bilstein also traces the many entrances and exits, mergers and corporate takeovers that have changed the landscape of the industry since the Wrights first flew on the beach at Kitty Hawk in December 1903.<br />Taking center stage in this synthesis, which is by far the best overview available on the subject, are the twin events of World War II and the Cold War. Both energized the industry as nothing has before or since. The United States military realized early on that while air power did not assure victory, its absence could assure defeat. Accordingly, government investment in the technology of flight has been both significant and persistent. Bilstein does an excellent job telling this story with grace and insight.<br />This paperback is a reprint of Bilstein's &quot;The American Aerospace Industry: From Workshop to Global Enterprise,&quot; published by Twayne Publishers in 1996, but now out of print. This reprint edition, as well as the 1996 version, are outstanding and may be read profitably both by scholars and those with a general interest.s paperback is a reprint of Bilstein's &quot;The American Aerospace Industry: From Workshop to Global Enterprise,&quot; published by Twayne Publishers in 1996, but now out of print.

I recently reread \\"The Mormon Experience\\" because I realized that 25 years had now passed since it first appeared and I wanted to see how well it has faired over the years. Let me report that it has indeed stood the test of time very well. Taking a roughly chronological approach, with individual topical chapters, authors Arrington and Bitton, both lifelong members of the Latter-day Saint Church, produced a masterpiece. Their task was straightforward, but most difficult, to produce a readable one-volume history of the church that was honest, legitimate, and responsive to the needs of both believing churchmembers and nonmembers.<br /><br />This book appeared during a time of encouragement and inescapable excitement about Mormon history. Leonard J. Arrington, then LDS Church Historian, was modernizing the LDS archives and sponsoring varied and far-reaching research of which this book was a notable contribution. There was a fleeting esprit de corps within the community of scholars working in the field, and much of significance resulted from far-reaching historical efforts. Indeed, Davis Bitton, one of Arrington's associates in the LDS Historical Department and co-author of this book, designated the decade between 1972 and 1982 a golden age, \\"a brief period of excitement and optimism--that someone has likened to Camelot\\" (Davis Bitton, \\"Ten Years in Camelot: A Personal Memoir,\\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 16 (Autumn 1983): 9-20, quote from p. 9).<br /><br />We did not realize it at the time, but \\"The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints\\" was very nearly the last official attempt to record the history of the Mormon Church in an honest and unblemished manner. In 1981 Mormon Apostle Boyd K. Packer threw down a gauntlet to historians of the Church that they should exclusively show \\"the hand of the Lord in every hour and every moment of the Church from its beginning till now\\" (Boyd K. Packer, \\"'The Mantle is Far, Far Greater than the Intellect',\\" Brigham Young University Studies 21 Summer 1981): 261-78, quote from p. 262). With such a perspective, church-mandated interpretations of the Mormon past are not easily overcome. Soon Arrington was quietly replaced as official LDS Church Historian and he and most of his associates in the Church Historical Department were transferred to Brigham Young University.<br /><br />What Arrington and Bitton produced here was exceptional. In 16 chapters divided into three parts-\\"The Early Church,\\" \\"The Kingdom in the West,\\" and \\"The Modern Church\\"-they range broadly over the history of the movement from its origins by Joseph Smith to its growing pains after World War II as it became a world religion. They based their work on the explosion of historical research that took place in the 1960s and 1970s, offering reinterpretations of early Mormonism, the middle period of frontier Utah with its characteristic plural marriage patterns, and the twentieth century church.<br /><br />\\"The Mormon Experience\\" deals candidly with difficult aspects of the church's creation mythology. This includes such issues as the discovery of multiple accounts of the \\"First Vision\\" that seemingly contradict each other. Arrington and Bitton summarize the problems and reconciliation of the various accounts in a way that would be acceptable to most Mormons: \\"If the later version was different, this was not a result of inventing an experience out of whole cloth, as an unscrupulous person might readily have done, but rather of reexamining an earlier experience and seeing it in a different light\\" (p. 8). It deals equally successfully with Joseph Smith's militarism and Mormon plural marriage in the Great Basin. In the modern era Arrington and Bitton explore the exceptionally important issue of priesthood for Blacks, which was offered by the Mormon leadership for the first time only in 1978. In every case, the authors successfully tread the tightrope between divergent positions on these issues and offer interpretations legitimate both to believers and those outside the church.<br /><br />This was no small accomplishment and both authors should be commended for their honesty and forthrightness. \\"The Mormon Experience\\" is as classic work.

I recently reread the book and although it is now more than fifty years old it remains the critical work of history on the subject. Dale Morgan should have been proud to produce such an ageless classic. \\"Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West\\" remains essential reading on the subject.<br />This book captures the critical elements of Smith's career. He went to the Rockies in 1822 to become a fur trapper and trader and over the next decade his efforts in that commercial activity lead to explorations that opened the region to U.S. expansion. Smith's explorations of the Rockies and Far West in the 1820s rank as some of the most significant expeditions of the nineteenth century. His skill as a frontiersman, as well as his undeniable ambition to develop a preeminent position for his company in the fur trade, combined with these expeditions to establish Smith as a heroic figure in the American West. In addition, his stoical persona and religious countenance became a role model for his fellow traders.<br />Well told in this important book is Smith's 1824 expedition that effectively discovered South Pass, in present-day Wyoming, opening a much easier route for trappers to cross the Rockies into the Great Basin without using the Missouri River. It also meant that settlers using wagons could take an easier route along the Platte and Sweetwater Rivers, then over the mountains using South Pass, and on to Oregon or California. It made possible the great overland migrations along the Oregon Trail beginning in the 1840s.<br />Most important, Morgan tells the story of Jedediah Smith's 1826-1827 expedition that traveled overland from the Great Basin to California and back. Undertaken to locate new trapping grounds, the expedition explored in a bull boat the Great Salt Lake and moved southward onto the Colorado Plateau. Pioneering along the Colorado River, Smith journeyed to the Mohave Desert and visited San Gabriel, California, there making contact with Spanish officials. He explored northward through the San Joaquin Valley and then turned eastward across the Sierra Mountains, the first people recorded to have crossed eastward, via the American River. By the time of Smith's return to the trappers' rendezvous the next summer, he had acquired more geographical knowledge about the Far West than any other American.<br />Smith's last great expedition took place in 1827-1828 when he retraced his route to southern California. There he renewed contacts with officials of New Spain. He then moved northward along the American west coast, travelling by ship from San Gabriel to San Francisco, and eventually reached Fort Vancouver, the Hudson's Bay Company outpost in the Oregon territory under the command of Dr. John McLoughlin. In the summer of 1828 he returned  to the Great Basin trappers' rendezvous. Once again, Smith's efforts led to the rapid expansion of geographical knowledge about the American West, but he also ascertained and gave to U.S. authorities much about the strength of Spanish and British claims on the region.<br />In summary, Dale Morgan notes that Jedediah Smith must be credited with being the first to find and recognize the natural gateway to the Oregon country through South Pass; the first overland traveler to reach California; the first white man of record to cross the Sierra Nevada; and the first to travel overland from California to the Columbia.  Unlike most other explorers of the nineteenth century, Smith's expeditions were not underwritten by the federal government but were the byproduct of efforts to further his company's fur trading business.<br />This book provides an excellent discussion of these critical explorations, as well as an interesting window into the larger fur trade of the Rocky Mountains and the colorful cast of characters that engaged in it, such as Jim Bridger, \\"Broken Hand\\" Fitzpatrick, and Hugh Glass. It also tells of the demise of Smith, who decided in 1830 to retire from fur trade and enter the Santa Fe trade. The next spring he left Independence, Missouri, with a wagon train bound for Santa Fe, but on May 27, 1831, he was killed by Comanche Indians while searching for water for the wagon train on the Santa Fe trail. He was only 32 at the time.<br />This is still an essential work for anyone who seeks to understand the exploration of the Trans-Mississippi West. Jedediah Smith ranks second only to Lewis and Clark as an explorer of this region and Dale L. Morgan's biography stands up remarkably well to the changing perspectives on the history of this subject in the fifty-plus years since its first publication.

It provides an exhaustive exploration of the first peoples of America from Stone Age hunter/gatherer tribes to the highly organized civilizations of later eras. Underhill emphasizes the origins, backgrounds, and customs of the various North American First Peoples and explores their commonalties and divergences. The book is a fine work of history, sociology, and anthropology.<br />In fourteen chapters, Underhill discusses the migration of peoples from Siberia over the Bering Strait to the American Northwest. She then moves on to the development of agriculture, the rise of the so-called \\"civilized\\" tribes of the Southeast, and the encounters with Europeans in the Southeast. Underhill then moves to the Northeast, treating the development of Algonquin culture and the Iroquois Confederacy. Then she explores the history and culture of the Calumet of the Great Lakes and the Upper Mississippi. This is followed with a discussion of the horse culture of the Great Plains and the agricultural civilizations of the Southwest.<br />The latter portion of the book deals with the Navaho and Apache, whom Underhill characterizes as the late arrivals to America. She then investigates the Native Americans of the Great Basin, California, and the Potlatch culture of the Pacific Northwest. The last chapter deals with the relationship of the United States government to native peoples. This is a rather troublingly positive assessment of the government's activities on the American Indians' behalf, when the beneficial aspects of the relationship might be considered a definite minority of all that has transpired between the Native and Anglo populations.<br />&quot;Red Man's America&quot; is still a very good book despite how dated it is, and may be read profitably as an overview of the subject. Indeed, despite the large number of books on the history of Native Americans, this remains one of the best on the subject.overview of the subject.

Lawrence Foster, professor of history at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is well-known as one of the outstanding scholars working in the \\"New Mormon History.\\" Specializing in the interpretation of the socio-cultural and religious contexts of gender relationships in the early nineteenth century, Foster's earlier book--Religion and Sexuality (Oxford University Press, 1981)--was a trailblazing work dealing with the Shakers, the Mormons, and the Oneida perfectionists. This newer study brings together Foster's already published essays on this subject, although they are much revised from the originals, and offers a thoughtful and in many cases provocative investigation into alternative lifestyles among early American communal groups.<br /><br />Foster goes beyond his earlier research in this work by looking at the marriage and family patterns of those three groups and how they might illuminate present concerns over gender and family relationships in society. He suggests that the unrest in the early nineteenth century prompted an intense examination of virtually every social institution of the nation. A central part of that examination revolved around marriage and family life, especially as earlier means of enforcing sexual behavior broke down in response to the pressures wrought by industrialization, western conquest and expansion, and intellectual ferment. In religion the emphasis on millennialism and Christ's advent prompted the development of especially radical groups. The Shaker practice of celibacy was an outgrowth of preparation for the coming millennium. Mormonism's plural marriage system had roots in the same concerns, but was propelled more by the quest for knowledge about humanity's state after death. The Oneida \\"complex marriage\\" system also aimed toward perfection of humanity in preparation for its encounter with deity.<br /><br />After an introduction Foster included three chapters each on the Shakers and the Oneida community, each raising interesting questions and posing challenging interpretations. It is the four chapters on the Mormons, however, that made the most significant contribution of the book and offers the most insights about present concerns of patriarchy and gender relationships. Partly this is because Mormonism is a highly successful religious sect in the latter twentieth century and partly because Foster carries the story up to the recent stand of the Mormon church opposing the Equal Rights Amendment. He finds in all of Mormon history, moreover, a greater acceptance of patriarchy and second class position for women than in the other communal groups. with the exception of allowing more than one wife for much of its nineteenth century history, Mormonism's gender relationships were more in concert with larger American society than either the Shakers or the Oneida community. One intriguing question ( but giving a plausible answer would entail imaginative and probably counter factual investigation: did Mormonism's acceptance of patriarchy have anything to do with its great success vis-&agrave;-vis the other communal groups?<br /><br />\\"Women, Family, and Utopia\\" is a delightful and useful book, which adds appreciably to our understanding of these early communal groups. It is especially valuable in offering assistance in interpreting family and gender relationships. It will be fascinating to those interested in the early development of communal religions and is a worthwhile companion and sometimes counterpoint to other works reinterpreting the history of American sacred life in the nineteenth century.sing challenging interpretations.

It was, perhaps, the American Iliad. One estimate is that a book on the Civil War has appeared for every day that has passed since Lee surrendered to Grant. That is an awesome production. Jerry D. Thompson's monograph, Desert Tiger is one of that number, and it will find a place among a small group of Civil War aficionados.<br />The central character of this book is James \\"Paddy\\" Graydon, a 21 year old Irish immigrant who came to the United States in 1853. Once in the U.S. he joined the Army and served in the Southwestern frontier. In 1858 Graydon left the Army to become proprietor of the United States a bar/hotel/whore house near Fort Buchanan, known as one the toughest \\"watering holes\\" in the region. Graydon gained fame as a man who could hold his own against anyone.<br />In addition to personal daring, which he demonstrated repeatedly, Graydon mastered the difficult skills of \\"westering,\\" gaining fame as a scout, hunter, and Indian fighter. When the Civil War erupted in 1861 Graydon entered military service and commanded a company of volunteers in the Arizona/New Mexico region. Thompson asserts that Graydon quickly became the \\"eyes and ears\\" of Federal forces in New Mexico His success in command resulted from impressment of civilians into his unit and questionable (even for that time and place) disciplinary actions that led to rampant desertion and even more impressments to keep his command at full strength.<br />The author also describes two of Graydon's less than heroic military exploits. The first took place on the night before the battle of Valverde in February 1862. On that occasion Graydon placed boxes of lit howitzer shells on the backs of two pack mule and sent them into the Confederate lines with the intent of blowing up some rebels and creating a little havoc. But the animals got scared and ran back toward the Union camp where the shells exploded killing only the mules. The \\"mule raid\\" was a source of amusement for Federal troops--none of whom appear to have been animal rights activists--thereafter.<br />More suspicious was the murder of a party of Mescalero Apaches by Graydon and his men in October 1862 in what was called the \\"Gallinas Massacre.\\" The massacre led directly Graydon's murder on November 5, 1862, because of a disagreement with a union surgeon named John Whitlock over the nature of the engagement. In an exchange of gunfire between the two, Graydon was mortally wounded and some of his company then killed Whitlock.<br />This small study tells what there is to know about \\"Paddy\\" Graydon.

Almost every belligerent nation of World War II organized massive scientific efforts to develop weapons that they believed would alter the course of the conflict. The Germans, among other projects, built and launched several thousand V-2 rockets against London and other European cities. The Japanese worked on an ill-conceived and unrealizable &quot;death ray.&quot; Only the American effort to build the atomic bomb, however, fulfilled the promise of a truly revolutionary weapon that had the potential of changing the war's outcome. The history of the Manhattan Project--as well as both the significance and terror of the nuclear weapons that emerged from the effort--has been exhaustively documented since 1945.<br /><br />While most knowledgeable readers are aware that there were also efforts to develop nuclear weapons by other nations, notably in Germany, the making of the atom bomb has largely been told as an American story with the far-ranging efforts of the Manhattan Project taking center stage. But atomic science was an international endeavor and even the Manhattan Project was more of an allied effort than most have traditionally understood. As a result, Ferenc Morton's Szasz's &quot;British Scientists and the Manhattan Project&quot; serves as a useful corrective to many earlier accounts that have all but buried any knowledge of the British role in the project.<br />Beginning in December 1943 the British government sent to the remote New Mexico site of Los Alamos, where J. Robert Oppenheimer was presiding over a cadre of physicists and other scientists and technicians to design an atomic weapon, a small group that eventually numbered about 30 scientists to assist with the project. They worked long hours side-by-side with the Americans, witnessed the explosion at the Trinity site, and viewed the success with the same horror and amazement as their U.S. colleagues. Most of their names are unknown to all but a few specialists in the history of high energy physics, and the one that is not--Klaus Fuchs--is remembered only as an atomic spy for the Soviet Union. This short book does much to rescue the group from obscurity, as well as to set the record straight on Fuchs. It is an important addition to the literature of Los Alamos and the Manhattan Project.one that is not--Klaus Fuchs--is remembered only as an atomic spy for the Soviet Union.

Susan Curtis argues that the Social Gospel provided a necessary linkage between the Protestant-Victorian construct of society of the nineteenth century and the more secular consumer culture that emerged following World War I. Most Social Gospel reformers of the 1890s shared middle-class origins and a concern for the underside of America civilization. They have been portrayed, usually accurately, as a generation of Christian reformers who gave up their middle-class comforts to enter a world of squalor and hopelessness to help others. They ministered in ways that were fundamental to an urban underclass.<br />Curtis confesses in her preface that she was skeptical of the &quot;do-gooder&quot; image of those involved in the Social Gospel movement. Not surprisingly, therefore, she found good reason for skepticism. &quot;For these American Protestants, responsible for acts of courage and kindness in the name of social justice,&quot; she wrote, &quot;were also men and women bedeviled by private anxieties that impelled them into the arena of reform&quot; (p. xi).<br />Carrying farther the well-established theories of status anxiety developed for progressive reformers of the same era by George D. Mowry and Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., Curtis argued that they not only honestly wanted to accomplish good in the world but also desired to find meaning in a world undergoing rapid and sustained change in response to forces collectively identified as modernity. According to Curtis a range of motivations propelled the Social Gospelers and their activities; some overt and others subconscious, some lofty and others more base.<br />The Social Gospel, Curtis suggested, emerged in response to the dislocations of the industrial revolution in the late nineteenth century, including large-scale immigration and rapid and sustained urbanization. In its early expression the Social Gospel brought to the fore a sustained critique of industrial capitalist society and helped to displace the traditional American Christian concern for afterlife and eternity with an emphasis on the welfare of humanity in the here and now.<br />For Social Gospelers the Kingdom of God was very much of this world and not the next. It was something of a utopian vision that represented a spiritual condition where righteousness and justness are partners with goodwill and charity. The result would be what Washington Gladden, one of the reformers profiled here, defined as &quot;social salvation.&quot; To accomplish it Social Gospel advocates organized cooperative ventures, undertook political activism, and engaged in a variety of reform efforts with specific goals. The heart of Curtis' interesting and convincing thesis is that some of the elements of the Social Gospel's ideology, as well as its members' desires, sought a place not in opposition to industrialism and modern society but in concert with it. Bound up in a dramatic cultural transformation as the older Protestant- informed Victorian order gave way to a modern, secular American society after World War I, the Social Gospel moved more in parallel rather than in apposition with these trends. By the 1920s, Curtis concluded, the adherents to the Social Gospel's ideas and actions made it easier for Protestant Americans to embrace a secular culture in which Protestantism was not prominently featured. They contributed to an American culture that validated abundance, consumption, and self-realization. Social Gospelers, reformers though they were, created not a critique of modern capitalism, but rather a consuming faith in the material abundance it promised (p. 278).<br />The Social Gospelers, therefore, not only accomplished positive social ends on a broad front but also established an intellectual rationalization for modernity that allowed contentment with the world. Curtis demonstrates this thesis through a series of biographical portraits of fifteen Americans involved in a variety of Social Gospel activities. In subtle ways these individuals came to embrace modernity and the secular social system that emerged in the 1920s.<br />There is much to praise and little to criticize in \\"A Consuming Faith.\\" Susan Curtis argues her case well, and offers a convincing thesis explaining certain aspects of the paradigm shift that took place in American society between the 1890s and the 1920s.

US	36818999	R3HNW3FLYVDTEU	0671757466	620845244	A Proud American: A Proud American	Books	4	5	8	N	N	Good, but not a Great Autobiography	The story recounted here makes Horatio Alger look like an also-ran. At first Joe Foss was not unlike most other teenage boys on South Dakota farms during the Depression of the 1930s. He worked to help his family make ends meet and longed for escape to something more exciting. Also like many of his contemporaries he was enthralled by airplanes, but at that point his life took a different turn from that of most other rural South Dakotans. He was able to attend the state university--through which he is quick to point out he worked his way--and followed his dream of aviation by beginning flying lessons in 1937 and going through the Civilian Pilot Training Program run by the Civil Aeronautics Authority as a war preparedness measure in the late 1930s.<br />As soon as he graduated from the University of South Dakota, Vermillion, in 1940, Foss joined the U.S. Marine Corps and entered pilot training. In the fall of 1942, fresh from pilot training and service as an instructor, he arrived in the Pacific Theater and was assigned to a Marine aviation unit at Guadalcanal. When Foss reported for duty, Guadalcanal was one of the hottest combat zones in the world, with daily attacks by the Japanese on the American foothold on the island. During six weeks of combat, Foss flew several dozen sorties and recorded 23 air victories. He received the Medal of Honor for his actions and became a public hero in the eyes of an America that was desperate for heroes. Foss' later World War II career never equaled that early success and fame, but that was in part, he says, because the Marine Corps was hesitant to have a genuine war hero get back into real combat where his death might hamper morale.<br />Foss' war record set him in good stead after the hostilities. He was able to start a small aviation business in South Dakota, and his hero status served as a springboard for his election to the state House of Representatives in the latter 1940s. From there he ran for governor and eventually served two terms in the mid-1950s. Afterward Foss was appointed commissioner of the infant American Football League, serving between 1959 and 1966 and helping to build an organization that could challenge and eventually function on an equal basis with the much older NFL. He was also an avid outdoorsman and found a way to make hunting and fishing pay by hosting ABC-TV's &quot;American Sportsman&quot; between 1962 and 1965 and later hosting his own syndicated series. All this time he was a senior officer of the South Dakota Air National Guard. He remained active in civic, benevolent, and business affairs until his death.<br />This book ballyhoos Foss' successes and slides over his faults and failures. That is not particularly unusual in autobiographical writing. The occasional honest and straightforward memoir will appear, such as that of Ulysses S. Grant, but they are more rare than not. This book is the rule rather than the exception. It is also not bald-faced apology, like Richard Nixon's memoir, but it tends to self-aggrandizement. Readers are supposed to be mesmerized by all the wonderful things that Foss has done and all the celebrities, powerful politicians, and high-profile businessmen he has known. At one moment he describes his charity work and at another his hobnobbing with movie stars. While a little of this namedropping is impressive, there is too much of it here. It is clear that Foss had a strong sense of ego.<br />From an analytical perspective there is a subtext of conservative Americanism that runs through this autobiography like the jet stream, and it tells historians much about the man and the era. Without question Foss had a strong sense of national pride as well as political and social conservatism. His commentary on why he fought in World War II is telling in this regard. &quot;The Japanese were our enemies, and they had some ideas I didn't like,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They wanted to do away with our great country, and I liked America. And that's when Ifinally realized, for real, that if I didn't do my part in the war, I wouldn't have a farm to go back to&quot; (pp. 80-81). Foss' linkage of his participation in World War II to the preservation of the nation reminds me of a conservative nationalist position that the defense of the American homeland must begin on the far shores of the Atlantic and Pacific.<br />Foss' defense of conservative Republican politicians is also significant. He praises such demagogues as Joseph McCarthy, saying that he &quot;was a dedicated American who was willing to put his life on the line in actual combat, and I was there to witness it&quot; (p. 177). He also describes his relations with Richard Nixon as exceptionally friendly, even to the extent of pushing Nixon to continue his political career after his 1960 defeat for the presidency (pp. 158-59). Foss also champions the cause of the National Rifle Association and claims unqualified gun ownership--which, to his credit, he always describes as a responsibility not to be taken lightly--as a fundamental right of every American citizen.<br />The pervasiveness of American conservative values expressed in A Proud American will probably be troubling to some in our post-modern, multi-cultural society. The book does, however, provide important insights into sectors of twentieth century American society, business, and politics. As such it will be a useful primary source document for future historians.finally realized, for real, that if I didn't do my part in the war, I wouldn't have a farm to go back to&quot; (pp. 80-81).

US	36818999	R11X6GMJR4D4TP	0226259552	213298761	The Power of Culture: Critical Essays in American History	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A Pot Pourri of Cultural Studies at its Best	This is an important collection of essays on culture in the history of America. It bears all of the strengths and weaknesses of an anthology, repetition and disjointedness as well as insight and sometimes brilliant analysis. The nine original essays in this volume run the gamut from analysis of early American murder narratives through middlebrow culture to representations of technology at the 1964 New York World's Fair and Richard Serra's \\"Tilted Arc\\" as public art. In each the authors seek to explore the culture of Americans and how it relates to larger public and private issues.<br />The study of American history has been in crisis for some years, as older constructs have succumbed to the onslaught of deconstruction and other methodologies for exploring the past. Perhaps cultural analysis-a combination of sociology and anthropology applied to historical episodes-would help historians out of this cul-de-sac. As the editors comment: \\"At a time of deep intellectual disarray, 'culture' offers a provisional, nominalist version of coherence: whatever the fragmentation of knowledge, however centrifugal the spinning of the scholarly wheel, 'culture'--which (even etymologically) conveys a sense of safe nurture, warm growth, budding or ever--present wholeness--will shelter us\\" (p. 1).<br />I found two of the essays in this volume especially interesting. The first was Karen Halttunen's \\"Early American Murder Narratives: The Birth of Horror,\\" chapter 3 in the volume. She argues that the dominant narrative of murder was dramatically transformed in the latter half of the eighteenth century from a salvation story of the condemned murderer into a secular account of the horror of the murder itself. In other words, earlier accounts emphasized a jeremiad of redemption in which the murderer might make amends and achieve foregiveness through the forfeiture of life. The innocent slain played a critical role here not for the gruesome nature of their murders, but for providing the act for which the murderer needed salvation. It was very much, according to Halttunen, a morality play in which the condemned prisoner received justice and atonement. Evil is punished and those suffering are redeemed. Because of the Enlightenment and its secularization of culture this began to change. Instead of emphasizing the redemption of the murderer, the accounts after the end of the eighteenth century began to move away from questions of good and evil to discuss the nature of horror without the explicit value judgments associated with characterizing good and evil and religious terms.<br />The other essay that I found especially interesting was Michael L. Smith's \\"Making Time: Representations of Technology at the 1964 World's Fair,\\" chapter 8 in the volume. The 1964 New York World's Fair was, in the words of Robert Moses, \\"an Olympics of Progress\\" and \\"an endless parade of the wonders of mankind\\" (p. 223). Smith argues that historians have long commented on the failure of depictions of the past and the future in such extravaganzas to reflect reality. \\"In so doing,\\" Smith writes, \\"many of us have overlooked not only the particular dynamics by which these fairs (and corporations, and governments) codify and represent cultural values, but also the tactics with which the `audience' receives or reappropriates what they see\\" (p. 224). Smith suggests that the depiction of the future in the 1964 World's Fair strove \\"to be comforting, to evoke of sense of change only in the most cosmetic and unthreatening forms\\" (p. 226). In this context social strife disappeared, any other problems-economic or political or religious or cultural-also homogenized into a gentle positivistic structure in which all participated. Smith added, \\"the future it depicted, like its versions of the past, was an exercise in nostalgia. Its corporate exhibits applied images of technology as a way of dressing belief systems of the past in the trappings of future wonders\\" (p. 226). The inevitable march of \\"progress,\\" as Smith notes, solidifies and supports the dominant vision of the United States. The World's Fair, in essence, omits more than it portrays and in so doing offers a powerful commentary on the nature of American society in the 1960s.<br />\\"The Power of Culture\\" is an impressive book in many ways. The Halttunen and Smith essays represent what I consider the best of the book, but all of the essays may be read with profit. I certainly recommend this work as an example of cultural studies at the end of the twentieth century.ogress,\\" as Smith notes, solidifies and supports the dominant vision of the United States.

They were one of the best teams in the American League during the latter 1940s and 1950s, winning a World Series in 1948 and a pennant in 1954, but the last pennant race that they really participated in was in 1959. That is, until the 1990s when the team took several division titles and two pennants, 1995 and 1997, but lost in the World Series.<br />Author Terry Pluto contends that the demise of the Indians on the field can be traced to the April 1960 trade of slugger Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn. It wasn't a particularly good trade; Colavito was a ball-crushing slugger and a fan favorite but Kuenn was a batting champion who specialized in flares to the gap. For more than thirty years thereafter the Indians were pretty awful. The team did poorly on the field, which prompted fans to stay away from the games, which put the team into the red, which prompted the team's ownership to sell or trade its best players and to forego investment in its farm system, which led to even poorer performance on the field, and the continuation of a downward spiral.<br />There are an enormous number of bumbling incidents in the history of this baseball team, all detailed in excruciating detail by Pluto. Take the example of Rick Manning's contract. Before the beginning of the 1978 season the team sent him a contract offer 25 percent less than he was paid in 1977, despite the restriction in the MLB Collective Bargaining Agreement against cutting a player's salary more than 20 percent. It was a mistake, pure and simple, but emblematic of the team's slipshod management. Rather than allow him to become a free agent, the Indians resigned Manning to a five year, $2.5 million contract instead of $75,000 for a one year contract. It was stupid. So was letting Jim Bibby get away in 1978 by failing to pay him a $10,000 merit bonus he had earned during the 1977 season for making 30 starts. This incident became legendary and some of the players even wrote a little ditty about it:<br />\\"Pack up all my gear and dough<br />Here I go<br />Ho, ho, ho<br />Bye, bye, Bibby.<br />No one here understands me,<br />Look at the late check they tried to hand me...<br />Bye, bye, Bibby\\" (p. 196).<br />Then there was the June 1974 ten-cent beer night in which drunken fans rioted, went after members of both teams playing that night, and forced a forfeit. That was a disaster, but at least no one was seriously injured. What a screwy attempt at a promotion! What did the team's leadership think would happen? It ranks as one of the all time worst episodes in the history of Major League Baseball. Then there was the team's one foray into the free agent market. The Indians signed Wayne Garland to a ten year, $2.3 million contract in 1977 and Garland injured his arm in his first spring raining game. He never recovered. Then there were ridiculous trades: notably a 1965 trade to reacquire Rocky Colavito, but they had to give up both Tommie Agee (who went on to star with the New York Mets during their championship season in 1969) and Tommy John (who won 286 games after departing Cleveland).<br />The real curse of the Indians has nothing to do with Rocky Colavito. It has everything to do with incompetent management. Terry Pluto indicts Gabe Paul for most of the mismanagement. He served as general manager and/or owner of the Indians for more than 20 of the 30+ years that the Indians were horrendous. His supporting casts of buffoons includes general managers Frank Lane-known to all by his nickname of Trader because he loved to make deals to move players and almost all of them were Indian losses-and Phil Seghi. Perhaps the epitome of ineptitude was when the dignitary scheduled to throw out the first pitch at an Indians game couldn't make it and was replaced by Bozo the clown. The irony is striking.<br />Terry Pluto ends hisbook with a review of movement of the Indians from doormats to dominators of the American League. That really began when Dave and Dick Jacobs bought the team and infused it both with new leadership, who knew what they were doing, and the cash necessary to succeed.<br />\\"The Curse of Rocky Colavito\\" is an interesting and informative book.

Do they set the moral positions of their congregations or reflect their congregation's biases? Those are questions of significance, and David B. Chesebrough has spent his career seeking to understand them within the context of the greatest divisive period in American history, the fight over slavery that eventually led to civil war.<br />In this short and easily read volume Chesebrough seeks to explore the role of southern ministers who went against the grain of southern society and politics first to contest slavery and later to stand with the Union in opposition to secession and Civil War. Using a series of interesting case studies, Chesebrough suggests that the role of ministers in the sectional conflict was more complex than has been documented elsewhere. In spite of ostracism, coercion, and sometimes lynching, a few southern clergy stood up for antislavery principles throughout the period. After the creation of the Confederacy a small but vocal group of ministers opposed secession and war. Many of them met violence and death, justified by those inflicting it because of a &quot;traitorous&quot; stance toward the new government of Jefferson Davis.<br />Chesebrough tries to draw broader conclusions of the role of dissenters in southern society in the last chapter, using Arnold Toynbee's &quot;creative minority&quot; conception to characterize antislavery southern clergy. Toynbee argued that in any civilization only a small minority understands the current challenges and conceives new answers that offer a way out of present crises. If that &quot;creative minority&quot; is stifled or ignored the civilization will ultimately fail. While one may quibble with Toynbee's assertions, Chesebrough finds in them a striking saliency when considering southern antislavery clergy.<br />This is all very well, and Chesebrough has provided a service by documenting this dissent. Several large questions, however, await further consideration. Are there instances where this &quot;creative minority&quot; of southern antislavery clergy fundamentally affected the course of the sectional conflict? If so why, if not why not? Also, what role did the clergy play in mediating the divisiveness of the age? In a society as fractured as antebellum America would not the clergy naturally be called upon to ensure justice for all Americans, heal wounds, and find middle ground? Rather than crystallizing the extreme positions concerning slavery, perhaps the truly &quot;creative&quot; clergy in the South were those seeking both racial justice and political compromise.tion.

US	36818999	R1BWOGEZ05CHSR	1585440426	869746777	Pecos Bill: A Military Biography of William R. Shafter	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Revisionist History at Its Best	The image of William R. Shafter in American military history is one of a fat, incompetent buffoon who presided over one of the most disorganized escapades in our history, the American Expeditionary Force to Cuba in 1898. According to popular conception, what success that campaign did attain should be credited to Teddy Roosevelt or other commanders, not to Shafter. In this dandy military biography, Paul H. Carlson, a historian specializing in the development of Texas, has set out to correct these misconceptions and rescue Shafter from ill consideration and obscurity. The result is a fine addition to the literature of military biography and the Army during the latter nineteenth century.<br />Shafter, like so many Army officers during the Gilded Age, served well with volunteer units, most of them from his home state of Michigan, in the Civil War. With the Army of the Potomac at Ball's Bluff and the Peninsular Campaign, Shafter distinguished himself as a capable and effective junior officer. Later, with another regiment, Shafter served in the western theater, participating in the Tennessee campaigns. It was during this period that Shafter took command of his own regiment, a black infantry unit, earning a great deal of experience that served him later in the frontier army. By the end of the Civil War, Shafter had been promoted to brevet brigadier general of volunteers. In 1895 he would receive rather after the fact the Medal of Honor for gallantry at the battle of Fair Oaks Station on May 31, 1862.<br />When Shafter mustered out of service at the end of the war, he returned to Michigan but quickly found that he did not fit into civilian life any longer. In 1867 he applied for and received a commission in the regular Army and was sent to Texas as a lieutenant colonel of the 41st Infantry, a black regiment. Once again, he served with distinction.<br />Among his activities on the Texas frontier was the systematic exploration of the southern plains of the state. He was also involved in several Indian campaigns throughout the West, the most significant was probably the restoration efforts at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, following the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. In 1894, Shafter commanded troops that maintained order in Los Angeles during the American Railway Union strike. Once again, in every instance, Shafter's superior officers considered him a capable, efficient, and results-oriented officer.<br />It made sense, therefore, that he would have been offered command of the American Expeditionary Force to Cuba during the Spanish-American War of 1898. Although by then a senior officer with a tremendous weight problem, Shafter was, with men like Sheridan gone from the Army, a reasonable choice. He had a broad base of experience, had been effective at every command, was a senior officer in the Army, and was a Civil War hero with a Medal of Honor to his credit. Even so, Carlson comments that the decision to give Shafter the command was largely political. Secretary of War Russell A. Alger, for instance, was a fellow Michigan native and looked kindly on Shafter, and Shatter had several other highly-placed friends supporting his appointment. Moreover, probably the best candidate, commanding general of the Army Nelson A. Miles, had political ambitions that opposed those of the Republicans and President McKinley was too astute a politician to give him the vehicle to make himself a war hero.<br />Shafter became the choice, then, and was promoted to major general of volunteers. According to Carlson, he did not do badly. Although he had his troubles, Carlson argues persuasively that most were related to Shafter's inexperience in organizing, equipping, and maneuvering large bodies of men. He had experience previously commanding nothing larger than the shrunken divisions of the frontier Army. Carlson presents a clear assessment of Shafter's strengths and weaknesses: \\"He failed to bring order at Tampa, the jumping off point for the expedition, neglectedto draw clear lines of responsibility for staff officers and troop commanders, and too often overlooked important details. Indeed, his leadership may not have been decisive to the success of the expedition. Nonetheless, despite his shortcomings he moved an army of some 16,000 men a distance of 1,200 miles by water, landed on an enemy shore in open boats, in ten days drove the enemy back to his last line of entrenchments in front of Santiago de Cuba, and in fifteen days more compelled surrender of the city, the district, and an army of 24,000 men\\" (p 185). This is not the accomplishments, according to the author, of a buffoon.<br />Carlson's portrait of William R. Shafter, therefore, is a refreshing revisionist analysis of an important nineteenth century military figure. Perhaps at times the author is too persistent in trying to rescue Shafter from his reputation as an incompetent, but the arguments he makes are compelling. Even so, Carlson, does not paper over flaws in his character. Shafter was obstinate, profane, a womanizer, a sometimes drunk, and single-mindedly hard-boiled. He was also, Carlson admits, energetic, ambitious, self-reliant, and hard-working. When one finishes this book, there is a sense that Shafter was a flawed but capable figure. \\"Pecos Bill\\" is a fine book, well worth the reading.cted to draw clear lines of responsibility for staff officers and troop commanders, and too often overlooked important details.

For residents of the western part of the United States aviation was an especially significant engine of change, owing to the unique combination of open spaces, relatively small numbers of population, distances between urban areas, and, a pioneering spirit.<br />\\"Winqs Over Idaho\\" is a useful large-format illustrated history chronicling the growth of aviation in one Rocky Mountain state. The author describes in 16 chapters of referenced narrative and 184 photographs the aviation story of Idaho. Beginning with lighter-than-air activities with kites and balloons in the nineteenth century, Arthur A. Hart moves quickly into early air meets in Lewiston and Boise. He expends much effort dealing with barnstorming and daredevils but then moves on to the much more significant air mail activities of the 1920s and 1930s, the first time airplanes undertook practical activities.<br />From there, Hart delineates the development of a wide variety of aviation activities in Idaho. For example, he describes the maturation of a unique cadre of flyers in Idaho during the 1920s, the Mountain pilots--also called bush pilots in other parts of the world--who knew the terrain well and provided aircraft for hire for a variety of business, government, and sporting activities. In many instances inheritors of the legacy of these earlier skilled flyers still provide the only quick linkage to isolated areas in the region. His discussion of the growth of airline service is a welcome addition while still leaving room for additional work. Hart's description of airborne firefighting was useful for its detail about Idaho, while his narrative on coyote hunting from the air was both illuminating and slightly disturbing. His commentary on women aviators and the development of a state infrastructure for aviation are most worthwhile.<br />Arthur Hart finds, quite rightly, that World War II was the truly significant transforming force for aviation in Idaho, just as it was for the rest of the nation. The establishment of civilian pilot training programs at many locations by the Civil Aviation Authority, the creation of military airfields, and the expansion of knowledge about and access to aircraft (to say nothing of the technological developments that made aviation relatively safe and reliable) all combined to fundamentally alter public acceptance and use of airplanes in their daily lives. Hart's chapters on this period are especially valuable in beginning to understand this revolution.<br />Hart has done a creditable job of providing a general description of aviation in the state. While there is much positive that can be said for the book, \\"Winqs Over Idaho\\" lacks any analysis and interpretive structure. Hart understands this, and writes in his foreword that his book is only a beginning of inquiry into the subject. He hopes that &quot;others will take up the needed and fascinating task of researching in depth the history of aviation in every Idaho town and region&quot; (p. 6). Aviation in the American West very badly needs the in-depth study Hart recommends.r II was the truly significant transforming force for aviation in Idaho, just as it was for the rest of the nation.

He saw himself as an intellectual in the mold of Frederick Law Olmstead, whose travel accounts in the South and West have become classics of that type of literature. Stillman wrote about his travels in Texas for \\"The Crayon,\\" a New York magazine devoted to landscape art. The first appeared in the June 1855 issue and ran through April 1856. A total of 11 letters were published by Stillman in \\"The Crayon.\\" Divided into two series--the series were delineated by the year in which they appeared--the first contain seven letters and the second had four. It is these letters which editor Ron Tyler has assembled, edited, and made available here for the first time in book form.<br />During his six-month stay in Texas, J.D.B. Stillman commented in his letters on geography; the mixing of Spanish colonial, Mexican, southern, German, and black cultures; the settlement of west Texas and the conflicts with Indians, and the social and cultural aspects of life on the frontier. Stillman was especially interested in the German immigrant settlements along the Gulf Coast and spent considerable time there. He shared many of these people's values, especially their aversion to slavery, and enjoyed their company. He also used his medical training to gain an invitation from the Army to see the more untamed sections of West Texas. Practicing medicine as he went, Stillman visited Fort Clark; Camp Lancaster, from which two letters in the second series originate; and other places in the far west along the San Antonio- El Paso road. Finally, in the fall of 1855 Stillman returned to California, and settled in Sacramento.<br />This first book-length compilation of Stillman's writings about Texas will be a useful primary resource for those interested in the early history of state. While the letters have been available in \\"The Crayon,\\" this book makes them more readily accessible, something which The Arthur H. Clark Company has been doing for primary sources related to the American West for decades.

Tompkins, then a young associate professor of communication at Wayne State University, carried out field research in organizational communication at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama. Invited to the center by Walter Wiesman, who then managed an internal communication program for Wernher von Braun at MSFC, Tompkins was asked to review the internal communication program at the center and make recommendations for improvements, as well as conduct original research into aspects of the program. Von Braun gave Tompkins a broad mandate to explore the communication program and to interview people throughout MSFC.<br /><br />This book reflects on Tompkins' work at MSFC during the latter 1960s--he went back to the center in the summer of 1986--and analyzed the internal communication structure in NASA and MSFC at the time of the Challenger accident in 1986. He then compares and contrasts the communications practices present during those two periods and found a subtle but persistent derogation of the system in the 1970s and early 1980s. Tompkins appreciates the intricacy of the internal communications structure of complex organizations in modern America, and his most useful contribution to present-day leaders of the U.S. space program is in his description of the processes at play and how they lead to perceptions, attitudes, and actions.<br />For example, Tompkins describes the management tool known as the &quot;Monday Notes,&quot; used at MSFC in the 1960s. Beginning in the early 1960s Wernher von Braun required these notes from his key staff as a means of enhancing communication among managers. The notes had specific parameters: they could be only one page long, had to be written in paragraph style, and were expected to be totally candid in describing each week's progress and problems. Von Braun read each note and wrote marginal comments congratulating people on their successes, asking questions, making suggestions, or in some instances chiding people for lapses. Afterwards, von Braun's secretary duplicated the entire package of Monday Notes and marginalia, and sent a set to each of those who submitted them.<br />The Monday notes accomplished several positive things, according to Tompkins. They allowed for bottom to top communication for important issues free from interference by middle-level managers. Since the center director made comments on the notes and sent them back, they also provided valuable feedback from top to bottom. Packages of all the notes were also distributed to all contributors, thereby providing a useful horizontal communication structure. Various managers debated issues from their perspectives in the notes, allowing for a healthy competition in which everyone expressed their views before the center director. Finally, since managers submitting Monday notes to the MSFC director needed information from their subordinates, it forced a focusing at least once a week by all organizations at MSFC on the progress made and the challenges remaining in the accomplishment of particular missions. The communications system that grew as a result of the notes was particularly useful in identifying problems, developing solutions, and keeping everyone informed.<br />Tompkins juxtaposes the success of the Monday notes in the von Braun era to what he views as the decline of the internal communication structure at MSFC after the completion of Project Apollo. When a later center director stopped making comments on the notes, for instance, they ceased to be useful for top to bottom communication. Most managers came to think of them as just one more report to file, and the time taken in doing so was time wasted in the accomplishment of the mission. Immediately, the quality of the notes declined, and they ceased to provide useful information to the leadership.<br />Although he also used other examples, for Tompkins the decline of the Monday notes was symptomatic of the overalldeterioration of the MSFC communication system in the 1970s and 1980s. The destruction of Challenger in 1986 and the criticisms about internal communications at MSFC made in the Presidential Commission's accident investigation under the leadership of William Rogers solidified Tompkins' position on the center's weakened communication structure. Tompkins suggests that MSFC personnel knew about the probability of catastrophic O-ring failure but that the &quot;organizational neuroses&quot; present prohibited the word going to senior decision-makers. He writes that &quot;to know about a technical problem that can cause the loss of human life, and then fail to act upon that problem, is also a failure of communication and morality&quot; (p. 150). Most of the rest of the book is an explication of how communication at Marshall had degenerated to the point that an accident like Challenger could happen.<br />The book offers some important insights into communication systems for complex technical organizations. In that sense, Tompkins has provided a valuable primer on setting up and managing the free flow not only of information but of ideas that increase efficiency and productivity. It should be read by all space program managers for that purpose.<br />Clearly, there is much to be learned from the Challenger accident about the nature of complex technological organizations and equipment and procedures and communication. The full history of the event has yet to be published, but Organizational Communication Imperatives is a useful effort to help understand the accident and the issues surrounding it as well as much else. It is only one of several studies that will appear in coming years that analyze this episode from a variety of perspectives and draw lessons that--while perhaps flawed in some sense--are nonetheless useful for future decision-makers.deterioration of the MSFC communication system in the 1970s and 1980s.

Well, yes, I Guess So	There are few more significant areas of historical study for twentieth century America than the development of aviation. For residents of the Midwestern part of the United States aviation was an especially significant engine of change, owing to the unique combination of open spaces, relatively small numbers of population, distances between urban areas, and, a pioneering spirit.<br />\\"Borne on the South Wind\\" is a useful large-format illustrated history chronicling the growth of aviation in one Great Plains state. The authors describe in eight chapters of narrative and more than 250 photographs the aviation story of Kansas. Beginning with lighter-than-air activities with kites and balloons in the nineteenth century, Frank Joseph Rowe and Craig Miner move quickly into a discussion of the oddities of early aviation, called here &quot;watchimacallits&quot; because they were clearly weird contraptions constructed by inventors, some of whom were both brilliant and mad. They expend some effort dealing with air meets, barnstorming, and daredevils but then move on to the much more significant air mail activities of the 1920s and 1930s, the first time airplanes were widely acknowledged as having much practical application.<br />There is, appropriately enough, both a geographical and chronological center to Borne on the South Wind. In the first category, Wichita occupies center stage in this narrative. The city has for decades billed itself as the &quot;Air Capitol of the World,&quot; and while that is certainly an overstatement, it is one of the significant centers of aviation in the U.S. Accordingly, Rowe and Miner describe in great detail the rise of the general aviation industry there, led by such entrepreneurs as Walter and Olive Ann Beech, Clyde Cessna, and William P. Lear. The three companies those business leaders founded and operated in Wichita, accounted for the lion's share of whatever claims the city and the state had to leadership in aviation and account for the bulk of the discussion in this book.<br />The chronological emphasis is on the World War II era, for once again, that it where the bulk of the importance lay. The major aircraft manufacturers in the state--essentially Beechcraft, Cessna, and Lear in Wichita--received millions of dollars in defense contracts to produce military versions of their civil planes and to design and build both new models and components for other aircraft. Because of the knowledge base, skilled work force, infrastructure already in place in the city at the outbreak of World War II, other manufacturing firms soon set up shop in Wichita and any number of other craft were manufactured there as a result. Boeing, North American Aviation, and a host of smaller firms did business in the region during the war. Indeed, as a chart from the Aircraft Industries Association of America concluded about 34,500 aircraft were built in Kansas during the war, 11.5 percent of the U.S. total. Clearly, this marked the high water mark of Kansas contribution to U.S. aviation in the twentieth century.<br />The story of Kansas aviation since World War II has been one of trying to hang on to at least a portion of an ever shrinking manufacturing market. There were some notable successes, the business-class jets of Lear and Cessna became enormously successful beginning in the 1960s and have been a mainstay of manufacturing ever since. The state also became a haven for innovative general aviation entrepreneurs. For example, James Bede designed and marketed a kit for a tiny personal aircraft, either prop or jet powered. Additionally, Randy Schlitter formed a company to manufacture and sell sport and ultralight aircraft kits in Hays, Kansas. But the overall business trend for Kansas aeronautical firms has been downward. Rowe and Miner analyze this slide quite well, for instance, most of the firms that boomed in World War II either closed down altogether or greatly restricted their operations after 1945.<br />Aviation in general and especially in the American West very badly needs in-depth, sustained, question-oriented study. The rise of the air lines linking western cities deserves the same type of treatment that historians have given the railroad and other modes of transportation in the West in the nineteenth century. The development of military airfields in the West requires the same kind of analysis that has been the bread and butter of historians of the military frontier. \\"Borne on the South Wind\\" is one building block that can help in the process of understanding aviation in the larger West. As such it is a useful contribution.general and especially in the American West very badly needs in-depth, sustained, question-oriented study.

George B. Kirsch, professor of history at Manhattan College, offers a fascinating glimpse into the development of both baseball and cricket as important team sports in the mid-nineteenth century.<br />Kirsch describes baseball's movement from amateur to professional status after the Civil War, as well as providing an analysis of why the sport was so popular and how it eventually eclipsed cricket as a sport. In the process, he offers considerable insight into the nature of these two sports, who played them, the demographics of supporters, geographical strongholds such as Brooklyn (no wonder the Dodgers were one of the most beloved of professional baseball clubs and the most missed when they moved to Los Angeles), and the nature of clubs.<br />Kirsch concentrates on the well-organized amateur clubs, finding that they were more than groups of loosely-organized men who played the games. They were voluntary associations with organization and structure and dedicated to specific ideals. They held meetings beyond practices and games, and for many the club became the center of social life. They were dedicated to physical fitness and sold their sports to the greater society on that basis, but were also involved in other activities. Kirsch also documents that most of the members of the various clubs in the early era were at least in the middle classes with sufficient time and money to contribute to the sport. It was not until it was commercialized that baseball became the sport of the masses, and cricket never did so.<br />Baseball also cut across racial lines, there were black clubs, but these were also largely made up of members who were somewhat better off financially than average members of the race. The author also documents, and it is no surprise, that the cricket clubs had a much higher proportion of foreign born members, especially Englishmen, than did the baseball clubs. Indeed, Kirsch makes the argument that cricket's demise was tied to feelings of nationalism. Although he does not hold to the theory that cricket died out immediately after the Civil War, it was a decided backwater that did not have the enthusiasm surrounding it that baseball enjoyed. Cricket was popular among eastern elites until World War I when, Kirsch writes, &quot;Country clubs adopted new British sports such as tennis and golf, which became more popular then cricket because of their greater appeal to participants and spectators&quot; (p. 264).<br />One of the most interesting aspects of \\"The Creation of American Team Sports\\" the transition of baseball from an amateur, participatory sport to one that was professional and oriented toward spectators. The commercialization of baseball was caught up in the urbanization of America that took place in the Gilded Age. It was, perhaps, a logical outgrowth of the rising economic status of American workers, the increased amount of leisure time, and the rampant nationalism that celebrated the sport as the epitome of all that was virtuous in the nation. It was also a team sport, representative of the whole of the nation, with a decidedly individualistic aspect, in recognition of each person's uniqueness. Kirsch fully explains the many fits and starts of baseball's commercialization, highlighting difficulties with gambling, drunkenness, and other vices.<br />In all, Kirsch has produced a fine book that will be permanently useful to scholars, analyzing in one volume the personalities and core themes of the development of American baseball and its rivalry with cricket.

Cubbins was a B-24 pilot in World War II. Serving with the 420th Bombardment Group--called the Cottontails because of the distinctive white tails on the unit's aircraft--under the Fifteenth Air Force in Italy, Cubbins was involved in the bombing raids throughout the Balkans in 1944. This recollection adds significantly to our understanding of the details and especially the horrors of aerial bombardment. The author's descriptions of his missions, particularly the operations aga1nst the fiercely defended Ploesti oil installations, are especially graphic. They capture the peril and apprehension, as well as the excitement and heroism, of bombing missions over central Europe.<br />While the bombing activities are well chronicled in \\"The War of the Cottontails,\\" I found the latter half of the book the most interesting. There Cubbins describes with great' emotive power his experiences as an Axis prisoner of war in Bucharest, Romania. On July 3, 1944, Cubbins flew his B-24 nicknamed \\"Swashbuckler\\" on a raid to Giurgia, Romania. His aircraft was shot down and a Romanian peasant captured him almost as his parachute touched the ground. Sent to a POW camp in Bucharest, established at a hastily reconfigured school in the city, Cubbins spent a little less than two months in the camp. During that time Cubbins and his fellow POWs endured repeated bombing raids on the city and plotted unsuccessfully for an escape. When Romania capitulated in late August 1944 changing to the Allied side in the face of onrushing Soviet armies, Cubbins and his fellow POWs were released. They were turned loose in Bucharest to enjoy the hospitality of the city, and the result was a predictable bedlam.<br />Because of this senior Allied officers rounded up the ex-prisoners and arranged for their removal to Italy. They moved their troops to the Popesti Airdrome, a few miles from the city. By the evening of August 29, 1944, Cubbins writes, over 1,000 ex-POWs were at the airfield. The American senior officer, Lieutenant Colonel James A. Gunn III, and Prince Constantin Cantacuzene of the Romanian Air Force flew in his ME-109, which had been repainted with American flags, to Italy. Gunn arranged for B-17s to travel to Popesti to pick up Cubbins and the other ex-prisoners. By the first part of September 1944 these prisoners had been returned to American bases in Italy. Cubbins, and presumably most of the rest of his fellow POWs, were then sent back to the United States.<br />This book is one of the better memoirs in the chronicle of POW life in World War II. Well-written and insightful \\"The War of the Cottontails\\" is an unusually detailed and vivid account of one officer' s experiences in World War II. Cubbins has produced a fine book that will be permanently useful to academics and, more important, interesting to non-specialists.. The American senior officer, Lieutenant Colonel James A.

U.S. Manned Space From Mercury To the Shuttle	Books	4	6	8	N	N	A Pretty Good Astronaut Autobiography	This is the autobiography of one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts, selected in April 1959 to fly in space. Deke Slayton served as a NASA astronaut during Projects Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), and while he was originally scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 7 mission he was relieved of this assignment due to a mild, occasional, irregular heart palpitation discovered in August 1959. His only space flight took place in July 1975 as a crewmember aboard the ASTP mission.<br />Instead of flying, Slayton became the titular head of the astronauts, officially being named Coordinator of Astronaut Activities in September 1962, and was responsible for the operation of the astronaut office. In November 1963, he resigned his commission as an Air Force Major to assume the role of Director of Flight Crew Operations. For a decade he oversaw the activities of the astronauts, most importantly making crew assignments and managing the full range of astronaut activities. Slayton personally chose all of the crews, determining among other things that Neil Armstrong would be the first person to walk on the Moon in July 1969.<br />As one might expect, Slayton wielded enormous power at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston (renamed the Johnson Space Center in 1973) in his role as director of the astronaut office. He effectively kept a collection of egotistical-for good reason-hot-shot pilots under control and maximized their role in the NASA of the 1960s. His place in helping to ensure the success of Project Apollo cannot be underestimated. This book is the recollection of Slayton during his NASA career. It contains a lot of standard information that most space history buffs are aware of, as well as some new stories. As always in such books as this, Slayton seeks to get behind the techno-nerd facade of NASA and emphasize its human side. Accordingly, we see astronauts in social settings and in embarrassing situations, as well as in their hardworking day jobs. A high point of the book is the discussion his early experiences as a farm boy from Wisconsin who flew bombers in World War II, went to college on the GI Bill, and became a member of one of the most celebrated teams in modern American history, the Mercury Seven.<br />Michael Cassutt, an outstanding writer with a string of other superb books, ensures that this is an excellent memoir. Especially so, since Cassutt saw it through publication after the death of Slayton on June 13, 1993, in League City, Texas, from a brain tumor. This is not the best of the astronaut autobiographies, that distinction belongs to Michael Collins' \\"Carrying the Fire,\\" but it is a pretty good one.hardworking day jobs.

What results is a moderately interesting, marginally useful little book that will give readers something of the flavor of what it was like to deal with wounded and diseased soldiers in what many historians claim to be the &quot;first modern war.&quot;<br />Straubing has strung together the memoirs of ten doctors, nurses, and medics who served in the war. All were previously published between 1863 and 1911, are readily available in any good university library, and are superior to the extracts published here. Some of the recollections were written by such literary luminaries as Louisa May Alcott, Walt Whitman, and Frederick Law Olmstead and have an elegance not present in most other writings about the war. Others were prepared by physicians who were probably more comfortable with a scalpel than a pen and have a clinical tone about them. The compiler provides a brief, mildly interesting introduction to the subject, short chapter introductions to set the tone for the excerpt, a slim bibliography, and an index.<br />From my perspective, there are three fundamental reasons for republishing primary source materials as done by Straubing: the sources are generally unavailable to potential users because of age or inaccessibility; they present a new and different perspective on the past; or they can be used to teach the historical method to neophytes. If this collection has a use, it is the last of these, and I can see \\"In Hospital and Camp\\" becoming a source for high school and some undergraduate term papers.	2004-05-23

After nearly ninety years it remains the leading builder of transport aircraft in the United States and one of the two most significant in the world. Eugene Rodgers' &quot;Flying High&quot; is a fact-filled, interestingly written, and sometimes insightful popular history of the company started by William Boeing in 1916. Capitalizing on the assistance of normally reticent corporate executives, Rodgers has written an adequate--but nothing more--history of the aerospace giant.<br />Rodgers concentrates on Boeing's post-World War II airliner business. As such he tells stories of the design and building of jet transports from the 707 to the recent 777. Much of this is well-known, but he turns phrases well and tells illuminating anecdotes. There is only a little new information from corporate elites who provided him information.<br />As a result, this is far from the final word on Boeing. One looks hard to find systematic analysis of the role of the company in the larger aerospace industry. And almost nothing is said about Boeing's space operations and its systems integration efforts such as the TIE contract with NASA during Project Apollo.<br />I hope someone will write an honest, insightful history of this enormously significant aerospace corporation. Such an effort would require active support from Boeing leadership, something that does not seem likely in the near term. Would that it were otherwise.	2004-05-22

After World War II the high speed frontier became a special province of the NACA, and the transonic flight research conducted at the agency's test facility in the central desert of southern California achieved legendary status. When the NACA was transformed into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), emphasis on the problems of high speed continued unabated. Without question, one of the most dramatic, popular, and successful activities on this score was the X-15 flight research program.<br />&quot;At the Edge of Space&quot; describes the conduct of this program from the first flight on June 8, 1959, until the 199th and final flight on October 28, 1968. Initiated under the NACA regime--although all of the flights were made following the creation of NASA--the X-15 program was a joint venture with the military to test both the capacities of rocket-powered aircraft at hypersonic speeds (five or more times the speed of sound) and at extremely high altitudes. Milton O. Thompson describes well the major phases of the program: the testing of engine capability, altitude and speed confines, and human abilities to operate under such extreme conditions. The X-15 program yielded not only this information but also engineering and materials information integral to later spaceflight missions.<br /><br />The author, who spent his career at NASA's Dryden Flight Test Facility in the California desert, was one of the dozen research pilots who worked on the project during its nearly decade-long operation. Because of this background and the emphasis here toward autobiography, sans scholarly paraphernalia, readers learn quite a lot about the inner-workings of a flight research program and the human aspects of the pilots who labored on it. Some of those involved have become well-known figures in aerospace research and development circles, among them Scott Crossfield, Joe Engle, and the author. Moreover, pilot Neil Armstong, who also wrote a foreword for this volume, has become legendary because of his command of the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission.<br />Thompson is especially strong in describing the human dimension of the X-15 effort, enlivening the narrative with both heroic and humorous anecdotes. Readers, for instance, get to go bar-hopping with some of the X-15 pilots and learn something about their concerns in flying an experimental aircraft. These vignettes are both entertaining and illuminating, and while &quot;At the Edge of Space&quot; has some of the elan and persona made so popular by Tom Wolfe in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1979) there is more sense here that research pilots were only one part of a very large and complex team of individuals working on the X-15 project.<br />Thompson also does a very good job of treating exceptionally technical issues in a manner understandable to non-specialists. In this way, he is able to explain what exactly was at stake in the project. Much of the technical specifications he leaves to an exceptionally useful appendix containing the details of flight-by-flight activities. The result is the publication of the a wholly adequate general history of the X-15 program from inception through last flight. It is a different publication than a professional historian would have written, and Thompson admits as much in a note at the conclusion of the book, but it represents a fine first-person account of the overall effort.<br />I hope someone will take up his challenge to present a fully- documented historical account that places the X-15 program in the larger context of the history of technology and the development of aerospace systems. As it is, &quot;At the Edge of Space&quot; will stand as benchmarkto begin analysis of this important research program.begin analysis of this important research program.	2004-05-22

Such striking population growth in such a compressed period brought radical dislocations in local politics, economics, society, and religion. &quot;Frontier Faiths&quot; analyzes the transformation of Los Angeles' religious life during that period--although some aspects of the political, economic, and social atmosphere are also illuminated. Michael E Engh, S.J., in the faculty at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, has produced a useful monograph on the evolving interrelationships of the denominations in the area. It adds significantly to the understanding of the manner in which culturally diverse groups cooperated--and competed--when thrown together after dislocations brought on by military conquest and political annexation.<br />Engh's central themes revolve around how the religious community contributed to the creation of a unique urban culture. He notes that before the Treaty of Guadelupe Hidalgo Mexico recognized only Roman Catholicism as a legitimate religion. Suddenly, with annexation support of state religion was abolished and replaced with religious toleration. Over time, largely because of migration to the city, Protestantism became the dominant religion. He traces this evolution in detail. Additionally, with strong sections on the Jewish and Chinese contributions to this development, Engh concludes with a discussion of the fall of Catholic culture and the rise of religious and ethnic diversity in Los Angeles.<br />&quot;Frontier Faiths&quot; is a useful case study in comparative American religion and how it helped to shape American society one area. It is one of several refreshing books to appear recently on the development of American religion. It should be of use to specialists interested in the development of American religion and culture during the nineteenth century.	2004-05-22

A generation embraced Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis, regardless of its sweeping and not always appropriate generalities, as an explanation for American uniqueness. &quot;Historians of the American Frontier,&quot; therefore, is an important attempt to come to grips with the people who made the frontier the most significant field of historical study in the first decades of the twentieth century and of those who have carried on the torch.<br />John R. Wunder, Director of the Great Plains Center at the University of Nebraska, presents an impressive set of essays on the lives and works of 57 frontier historians. Each chapter, written by a different specialist, includes a brief biography and a complete summary and analysis of publications. Wunder used four criteria to select the people included in this collection: they (1) had to be dead, (2) had to be recognized as leaders in frontier studies, (3) had to produce broadly-defined frontier history, and (4) did not have to be either academically-oriented or even historians in any strict sense.<br />Any collected work's quality is uneven and this book is no exception. Some of the essays are more successful than others. I found particularly rewarding Robert P. Swierenga's entry on James C. Malin. There are, however, two built-in difficulties with collections of this type. First, although &quot;Historians of the American Frontier&quot; is an important attempt to assess frontier historians and their literature, it views the subject from the perspective of individuals only. There remains, unfortunately, no synthesis of the overall field of study. Each historians' work stands essentially alone.<br />Second, historians are unevenly represented. Angie Debo, LeRoy Hafen, Reuben Gold Thwaites, Dale L. Morgan, and even Francis Parkman are not found here while less worthy entries abound. The editor anticipated this criticism by suggesting that no historians were &quot;left out by design or accident&quot; (xii) and that a second bio-bibliographical volume would resolve the omissions but that has yet to be published.<br />In spite of these criticisms, Wunder has produced a fine book that will be permanently useful to scholars, making readily available in a single volume the personalities and core themes of American frontier historiography. An important addition to the scholarship of the American frontier, it will be a standard reference for years.ng that no historians were &quot;left out by design or accident&quot; (xii) and that a second bio-bibliographical volume would resolve the omissions but that has yet to be published. <br />In spite of these criticisms, Wunder has produced a fine book that will be permanently useful to scholars, making readily available in a single volume the personalities and core themes of American frontier historiography.

US	36818999	R82690ECHWVH8	0874211476	513386039	The Mormon Presence in Canada	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Collected Work, with all its Strengths and Weaknesses	Increasingly in recent years historians of Mormonism have turned their attention to the question of the church's history outside the United States, certainly a positive development as those plowing the field begin to move beyond the hidebound story of Joseph Smith and the founding and first generation experiences of the Mormon movement to consider other aspects of the religion's history. This exploration of Mormonism in Canada was precipitated by the centennial of the settlement of Mormons in Alberta in 1887 and a symposium that was organized to review the subject. It is from this conference that the articles published in this collection were derived.<br />While a subject of significance, until the recent centennial most historians did not investigate this subject extensively or with any real seriousness. \\"The Mormon Presence in Canada\\" is a gleaning of some of the best short research on the subject, placing emphases on the topic and serving as a partial corrective of past neglect. As a result, it is a most welcome collection of articles. Taken altogether and arranged roughly chronologically, the 17 chapters, each written by a different specialist, represent a particular aspect of Mormon history, culture, and social development in Canada during the period since the 1830s.<br />Some narrow and others broadly interpretive, the articles in this book are far more interdisciplinary than most works of this type, another positive trend as several social sciences and arts interchange perspectives, methodologies, and interpretive models to explain various aspects of the subject.<br />Any collected work's quality is uneven and this book is no exception. Some of the essays are more challenging than others; I found particularly rewarding and convincing Armand L. Mauss, &quot;Mormons as Ethnics: Variable Historical and International Implications of an Appealing Concept,&quot; in which he argued that Mormons should not be considered a distinctive ethnic group. While Mauss takes only a little exception to the framework of Mormon ethnicity to explain the historical development of the religion, used so convincingly by Thomas S. O'Dea, The Mormons (1957) and Jan Shipps, Mormonism: The Story of a New Religious Tradition (1985), he found that the cultural differences that set Mormonism apart from the rest of society have largely withered away in the twentieth century and the religion can no longer sustain the ethnicity claim. He commented, &quot;during the past century there has been an obvious convergence between Mormons and their host societies in North America, so that Mormons are required to reach ever more deeply into the bag of cultural peculiarities to find traits that will help them mark their subcultural boundaries, and thus their very identity as a special people&quot; (p. 348).<br />Also especially challenging was Dean R. Louder's &quot;Canadian Mormon Identity and the French Fact,&quot; which explores a genuine ethnic issue in Canada as it relates to the Mormon experience: the French/Anglo makeup of the nation. Using sociological tools and a perspective sharpened by personal as well as scholarly experience, Louder criticizes the Mormon church for its lack of missionary activity among French Canadians, for its neglect of French-speaking Mormons in Canada, and for its overarching emphasis on American, and therefore Anglo, aspects of its religious culture. This flies in the face of a resurgence of ethnicity officially sanctioned in Canada. &quot;Thus,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the official church and, by extension, its membership deny the cultural specificity of Canada and the existence of an international church within that country&quot; (p. 322).<br />Although each of the articles stands on its own and is a useful contribution, some themes and events are unevenly represented. There are no fewer than four contributions relating to Mormon polygamy, and five on the settlement of Charles Ora Card and the Mormons at Cardston and other parts ofsouthern Alberta beginning in the 1880s. Important topics to be sure, but some other areas go begging as a result. Only Richard E. Bennett's essay on Mormon activities in eastern Canada during the early part of the church's history, for instance, deals with that important subject. Only Dean Louder's contribution already mentioned considers the multi-ethnic nature of the country and its implications for Mormonism. I was disappointed to find only modest information, even though some was presented, on the political and economic activities of the Mormons in Canada.<br />There was also no systematic discussion of the evolution of the Mormon church's official policy toward Canada, something which would have been a useful study for present-day policy makers in the Mormon hierarchy. Finally, one of my pet peeves, there is absolutely no mention of the history of the Reorganized Church or of any other of Mormonism's factions in Canada. While a much less important part of the overall history of Mormonism, the Reorganized Church and probably the Strangite experience in Canada deserve some discussion in a book such as this and could have provided a useful counterpoint for analyzing church member backgrounds, relations with larger society, organizational structures, and the like.<br />These criticisms aside, this collection of essays is a good beginning in exploring the Mormon experience in Canada.of southern Alberta beginning in the 1880s.

US	36818999	R2GT2AG4DBWOJX	0830683860	753401750	The C-130 Hercules: Tactical Airlift Missions, 1956-1975	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Servicable History, at Best	There are few more significant types of military airlift planes in terms of number manufactured, diversity of mission, and familiarity to the aviation enthusiast than the C-130 &quot;Hercules.&quot; In this book Sam McGowan, a former C-130 mechanic and loadmaster, has attempted the history of this airplane's operations in the United States Air Force. His efforts reveal a wealth of firsthand knowledge about the airplane and its employment.<br />McGowan begins his book with a brief discussion of tactical airlift--the air movement of troops and cargo over intra-theater distances and often in a combat environment--prior to the procurement of the C-130. Thereafter he begins an involved recitation of the aircraft's use in the Tactical Air Command (TAC) and the two theater major air commands, the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF).<br />When discussing the C-130 in the late 1950s, McGowan devotes a few pages to the Lebanon crisis, to the Taiwan Straits emergency, and to operations in the Arctic. For the early 1960s he includes discussions of the Congo crisis, operations in India and Southwest Asia, and an overview of the several C-130 variants and units that flew them. From this short commentary of less than fifty pages, the author launches into a lengthy discussion of the use of the C-130 in Vietnam between 1964 and 1975. Most of the rest of the book is concerned with C-130 airlift operations during the war. He ends with a section on the 1974-75 transfer of the tactical airlift mission from TAC and the theater air components to the Military Airlift Command (MAC), thus centralizing in a single organization all responsibility and resources for the airlift mission in the Air Force.<br />While there is much positive that can be said for the book, The C-130 Hercules lacks the analysis that makes effective history. McGowan claims his book is designed for the aviation enthusiast rather than the academic historian, but that is no excuse these shortcomings. The Time-Life books on a wide range of historical subjects are beautifully illustrated and packaged to grab and hold the attention of enthusiasts, but many of them are also first rate in terms of research, writing, and insight into the nuances of their subjects. These characteristics of well-prepared historical study are lacking for the most part in McGowan's book. I will deal only with a two of the book's weak points.<br />For example, I question the perspective the reader receives of tactical airlift from McGowan, focusing as he does exclusively on the C-130. The author gives the impression that all USAF tactical airlift in Vietnam, or anywhere else, was provided entirely by C-130s. This creates a misperception about tactical airlift and of the aircraft, crews, and organizations that handled the mission. The author draws extensively upon Ray L. Bowers' superb &quot;Tactical Airlift&quot; (1983) volume in the official history of USAF in Southeast Asia series as a source, but nowhere does he demonstrate Bowers' understanding for the totality of the airlift system.<br />In addition, McGowan creates false impressions with frequent misstatements or incomplete discussions. For example, he has an irritating and unexplained grudge against the Military Airlift Command, the USAF organization that during the Vietnam era was responsible for the strategic airlift mission--airlift over intercontinental distances usually in non-combat environments--and that acquired the tactical airlift mission in 1974-75. Repeatedly, and for no demonstrated reason, McGowan belittles MAC. He grouses that &quot;There was a good deal of friction between MATS MAC's predecessor and TAC troop-carrier crews because MATS was very publicity-conscious and took every opportunity to blow their own horn, while TAC crews rarely got credit for anything&quot; (p. 60). Whether true or not, and I doubt publicity-seeking was any more true of MAC than other USAF major commands, McGowan never misses an opportunity to take a shot at the command. Even when harsh judgments might be appropriate, his other overstatements, biases, and sometimes incorrect assessments of MAC's role in various airlift missions weaken them. It would have been more appropriate if McGowan had remembered that one of the historian's primary goals is to understand actions in the past and to explain them for the present-day reader.<br />Air power history very much needs an in-depth study of military airlift. No use of American military power has more flexibility and application in diverse situations and regions than airlift: it is used almost daily for the execution of United States foreign policy objectives in periods of peace, war, and international tension. The C-130 has been actively involved in these operations since it entered the USAF inventory and it deserves a complete, carefully-drawn explanation of how it has been used as an important tool of national policy. McGowan's work has presented a portion of how the C-130 has been used operationally, but we await a full-fledged study free from the bias and incompleteness that flaws this book. For an author interested in pursuing such a study, the opportunity is still present.misses an opportunity to take a shot at the command.

In this captivating book, based on a set of lectures he gave at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1995, Dyson explores possible futures in science, technology, evolution, and ethics. He argues that science and technology are offering the human race a myriad of exciting prospects, but that there are enormous challenges in harnessing them effectively. For example, he characterizes much of our most celebrated scientific and technological accomplishments as \\"ideologically driven\\" and therefore of lesser long-term value than intended. While they might boost national pride, they are too expensive and benefit too small a community to have significant effect on humanity. Ideologically driven technologies, furthermore, tend to leapfrog the type of rigorous experimentation so valuable in creating spin-off technologies of benefit to all.<br />Dyson is at his best when analyzing the ethical dimension of these technologies and what they portend for the future. Dyson offers this assessment: \\"Many of the technologies that are racing ahead most rapidly, replacing human workers in factories and machines, making stock-holders richer and workers poorer, are indeed tending to accentuate the existing inequalities in the distribution of wealth\\" (pp. 181-82). An object lesson is the proliferation of computer technology and the Internet. According to Dyson, since the poor have access neither to computers nor the Internet, and since jobs are increasingly being advertised on-line, they now no longer have access to many jobs. In this context, Dyson cries out for a commitment to social justice that would help mediate the widening gap between rich and poor. He also suggests that in the United States the commitment to \\"free market capitalism\\" is an ideology that has driven much technological development, playing as it does to the elites who can afford the technologies, to the detriment of humanity as a whole. It is a pointed, well-meaning warning for the future.<br />Dyson also seeks to look into the distant future, offering a fascinating portrait of what he calls the \\"seven ages of man.\\" Here Dyson looks ahead at several levels, from ten years to infinity. First, looking out ten years he sees a time-scale with which are all familiar and one that dominates everyone's planning. In that decade we will see the rise of biotechnology and other breakthroughs just becoming a part of civilization's consciousness. Second, he looks out one hundred years and suggests that we can reasonably extrapolate from what is presently taking place. Here he sees humanity moving outward into space and grappling with numerous environmental issues on Earth. Third, one thousand years in the future humanity will have populate the Solar System and probably our corner of the Milky Way. But neither politics nor technology is predictable. Fourth, at ten thousand years Homo Sapiens will have evolved into a variety of subspecies or perhaps ceased to exist at all. Fifth, at one hundred thousand years we can only speculate on an entirely different civilization than anything imagined today. Sixth, at one million years in the future Dyson asks questions about life and its quality but is totally nonunderstandable to us. Seventh, Dyson explores the nature of infinity and the death of universe.<br />What does the future hold? No one knows for sure but Freeman Dyson offers a compelling set of possibilities in \\"Imagined Worlds.\\" He quotes from Samuel L. Gompers, founder of the American Federation of Labor, that this is what should happen in the future:<br />\\"We want more school houses and less jails,<br />More books and less guns,<br />More Learning and less greed,<br />More justice and less revenge,<br />We want more opportunities to cultivate our better nature\\" (p. 177).<br />Dyson believes this is fully achievable. If we can imagine it, we can accomplish it. This is a most uplifting and challenging read. Enjoy!	2004-05-20

Its emphasis is on communicating a basic understanding of planetary astronomy rather than focusing on scientific details. This makes the book an outstanding introduction to a complex and fascinating subject. The general public rather than astronomers and space scientists are the primary audience for this work, but conceivably specialists in the field could read this book with profit. Jurgen Rahe, NASA's late director of Solar System exploration, sponsored this work as a formal effort to provide general readers with a reliable, well-written overview of planetary astronomy. He succeeded in that objective as author Ron Schorn has published a fine entree to comprehending the breadth of the subject.<br />Of course, planetary astronomy is generally categorized as consisting of the outer planets and inner planets of the Solar System. Schorn begins with a discussion of the nighttime sky and what one may view there. While he discusses the possibilities for origins of the universe, and the galaxies on view every night, his focus is on what planets one might view with the naked eye, relatively simple telescopes, and then more complex instruments. At that point he journeys back in time to the earliest observations by the ancients and how they constructed their understanding of the universe based on astronomical observations. He then quickly moves forward to the twentieth century when understandings of planetary astronomy changed rapidly in response to ground and airborne observatories and especially space probes sent to the various planets of the Solar System.<br />Schorn discusses at some length the many spacecraft that have been sent to the inner planets by the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as European and Japanese consortia, traveling to Mercury, Venus, and particularly Mars. This book explains well the story of such missions as the Mariner series that journeyed to these planets, the two Viking spacecraft that landed on Mars in 1976, and plans for future explorations of the red planet. Some spacecraft have been sent, but far fewer, to the outer planets. Visits to the gas giants of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and the small distant rock known as Pluto have been largely the province of the United States' efforts. NASA, for example, sent Pioneer 10 and 11 on a &quot;windshield&quot; tour of Jupiter and Saturn in the 1970s; following soon thereafter with Voyagers 1 and 2 that flew past the gas giants beginning in the latter 1970s through the 1980s. This activity, Schorn asserts, represents a golden age for Solar System exploration.<br />Schorn is at his best in discussing the decline of planetary astronomy in the early twentieth century--as astronomers led by Edwin Hubble focused their attention on galaxies beyond the Milky Way rather than on the Solar System--and its recovery in the 1960s as NASA reenergized planetary exploration with the first probes to Venus and Mars. This reemphasis on planetary astronomy was actually quite practical. The recently created NASA held a mandate to undertake exploration of the cosmos with both human and robotic spacecraft. Since the technical capability for planetary exploration existed, NASA's scientists focused their attention there. Even more important, according to Schorn, these scientists also emphasized lunar exploration as an adjunct of NASA's Apollo program to humans on the Moon. These efforts revitalized scientific study of the Solar System and yielded an enormous harvest of understanding about our immediate corner of the universe.<br />Easy to read and dased on a wealth of sources, both oral and written, \\"Planetary Astronomy\\" is a wonderful introduction to an enthralling subject.

Anniversaries typically spark the reconsideration of historic events in all kinds of ways, from reinactments to ceremonies to historical publications. The 150th anniversary of the Mormon opening of the British mission in 1987 was no exception. For example, the Mormon History sponsored an annual meeting at Oxford University which focused on the Mormon experience in Great Britain.<br />It is largely from this conference that the articles published in this collection were derived. While a subject of significance, until the sesquicentennial most historians did not investigate this subject very extensively. &quot;Mormonism in Early Victorian Britain,&quot; a gleaning of some of the best short work on the subject, places emphases on the topic and serves as a partial corrective of past neglect. As a result, it is a most welcome publication.<br />Richard L. Jensen, Research Historian of the Joseph Fielding Smith Center for Church History, and Malcolm R. Thorp, a member of the History Department, both at Brigham Young University, have assembled a set of diverse essays on various aspects of the Mormon experience in Great Britain. Taken altogether and arranged roughly chronologically, the 16 chapters, each written by a different specialist, represents a particular aspect of Mormon culture in Britain during the nineteenth century.<br />Some narrow and others broadly interpretive, the articles in this book contain a heavy emphasis on social history. This is probably as it should be, with the current state of historical inquiry emphasizing social science methodology and themes. Essays on the backgrounds and lifestyles of Mormon converts, regional and local studies of Mormon life, and the overall cultural setting in Britain which allowed Mormonism to flourish abound. There is also something included here which has been largely ignored in recent Mormon historical writing: administrative history. One of the potentially productive avenues that can be explored in seeking to understand the place Mormons occupy today, administrative history in this book takes the form of detailed studies of regional conference organization and functioning, church courts and governing, and the unique organization in Britain of Mormon pastors and pastorates.<br />These essays represent an added appreciation of the potential of administrative history and a fine beginning toward greater understanding of the church's development. Finally, there are several essays which deal with Mormon/non-Mormon interrelation- ships and difficulties which serve as additives and in some instances correctives for similar studies in other nations.<br />Any collected work's quality is uneven and this book is no exception. Some of the essays are more challenging than others; I found particularly rewarding Grant Underwood's analysis of &quot;The Religious Milieu of English Mormonism&quot; and Susan L. Fales' demographic portrait of Mormons in Leeds. There are, however, two built-in difficulties with collections of this type. First, although Mormons in Early Victorian Britain is an important attempt to present detailed contributions on aspects of the topic, it views the Mormon experience in Britain only through the lens of selected events, institutions, personalities, or whatever. There are also huge gaps in the story of the British mission that a reader can only guess at from this publication. There remains, unfortunately, no synthesis of the overall field of study. Each essay stands essentially alone.<br />Second, themes and events are unevenly represented. An obvious omission is the complete lack of discussion of the history of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Britain. While a much less important part of the overall history of Mormonism, the Reorganized Church experience deserves some mention in a book such as this and could have provided a useful counterpoint for analyzing church member backgrounds, relations with larger society, organizational structures, and the like. Were the people who joined the Reorganized Church like those that joined the larger Mormon organization? Were there commonalities of background and economic, social, and political status between the two groups. How did the institutional frameworks of the two church's adapt to the surroundings and problems of Victorian Britain? These and a host of other questions could have been asked in essays on this subject. Although several papers relating to the Reorganization's experience in Great Britain were presented at the Oxford conference, none were included in this collection and this omission is a glaring example of a lack of concern among many new Mormon historians about issues and themes outside the mainstream of Mormon historical interests. Not even David J. Whittaker's otherwise excellent bibliographical essay on Mormonism in Victorian Britain mentions any of the literature on the Reorganization's history there, although there are a half-dozen or so useful publications on the subject.<br />These criticisms aside, this collection of essays is a fine beginning in exploring the Mormon experience in Great Britain. It, along with other studies published as a result of interest sparked by the sesquicentennial, have rescued the subject from obscurity. This book will be of interest to scholars and general readers alike as a fine introduction to a complex and fascinating subject.es, and the like.

Alexander, professor of history at Brigham Young University and one of the leaders of what has been called the &quot;New Mormon History&quot; that tries to approach the subject with functional objectivity, has written a good biography of the Mormon Church's fourth president. Alexander asserts that Woodruff was &quot;arguably the third most important figure in all of LDS Church history after Joseph Smith...and Brigham Young&quot; (p. 331). While perhaps an overstatement, there is no question but that Woodruff was a central leader of nineteenth century Mormonism. He was a member of the church's council of twelve apostles between 1835 and 1889. Then he became president and headed the Mormon movement until his death in 1898 at age 91.<br />Alexander presents Woodruff as a true believer in the message of Joseph Smith and the Mormon religion. That meant, for Woodruff, the acceptance of &quot;a world view that unified the temporal and spiritual realms in God's kingdom and in the lives of church members&quot; (p. xiii). That holistic view of the temporal and spiritual found expression in the Mormon theocratic state of early Utah. Ironically, Woodruff began the dismantling of that theocracy in response to the challenges of federal authority. He, for instance, was responsible for the 1890 manifesto ending the performance of plural marriages and he set the course for Utah's statehood in 1896 by working to remove the church from politics.<br />Although there is much to admire in &quot;Things in Heaven and Earth,&quot; there are some imperfections. One of them is occasional demonstrations of pro-Mormon bias and the too-easy acceptance of the court position. For example, Alexander argues that the &quot;intermingling of church and state [in pioneer Utah] would have generated little opposition in a Protestant-dominated community&quot; (p. 176), but there is little reason to accept that conclusion. The quest for empire that early Rocky Mountain Mormonism mandated always ran against the grain of the American mainstream and the nation asserted itself to defend against a perceived threat to liberty. There are numerous examples in American history of other religious groups, in similar instances being handled roughly by the larger community.<br />Even so, &quot;Things in Heaven and Earth&quot; is a fine biography. It is sympathetic without being hagiographic, and Alexander's conclusions are usually well measured. It can be profitably read by anyone interested in the development of Mormonism, new religions of the nineteenth century, and the American West.n against the grain of the American mainstream and the nation asserted itself to defend against a perceived threat to liberty.

Although published in 1989 and long out of print, &quot;Apollo: The Race to the Moon&quot; still stands out as the best popular book on the subject ever to appear.<br /><br /> Neither a warmed over account of the astronauts and their adventures on the Moon nor a large-format illustrated history--both of which are in abundance--this book seeks to understand the larger contact of Apollo by focusing on the massive technical and scientific infrastructure that made the trips to the Moon possible. Taking as its central characters not the astronauts but the managers and engineers who ran the program, this book by famed author and political lightning rod Charles Murray and Catherine Bly Cox is based extensively on interviews with the remaining actors of the endeavor. The authors spent considerable time talking to NASA officials, both active and retired, at the Johnson Space Center, the Marshall Space Flight Center, and the Kennedy Space Centers, as well as high level officials in Washington. In this book Murray and Cox reconstruct a non-scholarly account of Apollo that examines operational details of the program that have gone undiscussed in astronaut-centric works.<br /><br /> By taking this approach Murray and Cox shift the history of Apollo to its most appropriate place. They recognize that the feat, as impressive as it was and as heroic as the astronauts truly were, was essentially an accomplishment of systems management. It was an endeavor that demonstrated both the technological and economic virtuosity of the United States and established national preeminence over rival nations--the primary goal of the program when first envisioned by the Kennedy administration in 1961.<br /><br /> Apollo was an enormous and complex undertaking, as Murray and Cox document with great skill, costing $25.4 billion with only the building of the Panama Canal rivaling the Apollo program's size as the largest non-military technological endeavor ever undertaken by the United States and only the Manhattan Project being comparable in a wartime setting.<br /><br /> Murray and Cox emphasize that Project Apollo was a triumph of management in meeting the enormously difficult systems engineering and technological integration requirements. James E. Webb, the NASA Administrator at the height of the program between 1961 and 1968, always contended that Apollo was much more a management exercise than anything else, and that the technological challenge, while sophisticated and impressive, was also within grasp. More difficult was ensuring that those technological skills were properly managed and used. Webb's contention was confirmed in spades by the success of Apollo. NASA leaders had to acquire and organize unprecedented resources to accomplish the task at hand.<br /><br /> There is a wonderful editorial in the November 1968 issue of &quot;Science&quot; magazine, the publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which speaks to the management system that Murray and Cox bring to life in this book: &quot;In terms of numbers of dollars or of men, NASA has not been our largest national undertaking, but in terms of complexity, rate of growth, and technological sophistication it has been unique....It may turn out that [the space program's] most valuable spin-off of all will be human rather than technological: better knowledge of how to plan, coordinate, and monitor the multitudinous and varied activities of the organizations required to accomplish great social undertakings.&quot;<br /><br /> If you want to understand the Apollo program, you must read and ponder this important book by Charles Murray and Catherine Bly Cox.

There have been several excellent Apollo astronaut memoirs, especially Gene Cernan's &quot;The Last Man on the Moon&quot; and Jim Lovell's &quot;Lost Moon,&quot; which was made into the feature film &quot;Apollo 13.&quot; This one is still the most honest and reflective of them all. It extends a tradition of the aviator as litterateur into the age of space travel.<br />Collins had an illustrious career as an astronaut. Chosen in the third group of astronauts in 1963, he served as backup pilot for Gemini VII, pilot for Gemini X, and command module pilot for Apollo 11. On that last mission he became the loneliest man in the universe when his two crewmates, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, landed on the Moon while he remained in orbit around the Moon in the Command Module. In &quot;Carrying the Fire&quot; Collins writes of his solitude in lunar orbit in July 1969. As he disappeared on the backside of the Moon from Earth, he recalled, \\"I am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life, I am it. If a count were taken, the score would be three billion plus two over on the other side of the moon, and one plus God only knows what on this side. I feel this powerfully-not as fear or loneliness-but as awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation. I like the feeling. Outside my window I can see stars-and that is all. Where I know the moon to be, there is simply a black void, the moon's presence is defined solely by the absence of stars.\\" He compared it to being in a skiff in the middle of the ocean with only the stars above and black water below. It proved a profoundly moving experience for him.<br />Michael Collins left NASA in 1970 and became the first director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, continuing to write eloquently of the possibilities of spaceflight. Among other works he published &quot;Liftoff: The Story of America's Adventure in Space&quot; (1988) and &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; (1990), a powerful exposition on the value of a human mission to Mars.<br />&quot;Carrying the Fire&quot; is the first candid book about life as an astronaut. The author comments on other astronauts, describes the seemingly endless preparations for flights to the Moon, and assesses the results. He also describes what he thinks of as the most important perspective that emerged from his flight, a realization of the fragility of the Earth. He wrote that \\"from space there is no hint of ruggedness to it; smooth as a billiard ball, it seems delicately poised on its circular journey around the Sun, and above all it seems fragile...Is the sea water clean enough to pour over your head, or is there a glaze of oil on its surface?...Is the riverbank a delight or an obscenity? The difference between a blue-and-white planet and a black-and-brown one is delicate indeed.\\"<br />It is a powerful and moving memoir. Read it more than once and lend copies to your friends.

According to author Robery S. Kraemer they certainly were. He points to several key missions as demonstrations of this fact: Pioneers 10 and 11, Vikings 1 and 2, and Voyagers 1 and 2, as well as a host of other projects begun during the decade. This important recollection explores many of the central themes affecting space science during the latter half of the twentieth century. It describes and analyzes the conduct of NASA's planetary science program throughout the 1970s, enhancing our understanding of the NASA missions to all of the planets of the Solar System save Pluto. Not so much a part of the \\"new aerospace history\\" as it is a ringing insider account of the subject, Kraemer's discussion provides the details that only a participant would know about the progress of these important missions.<br />It is a heroic story in Kraemer's telling, one filled with men and women of good character striving to achieve important objectives. They did not always agree with each other, and competed ferociously for their respective positions, but they all respected each other. The result was astonishing and that alone may have given rise to the belief that the planetary missions executed during the 1970s were the \\"golden age\\" of the program.<br />Although the case may be well made for this assessment at present, and Kraemer makes it well, will that be the conclusion of those one hundred years hence? Will probes sent to the planets serve, something like Columbus did with the Americas, as vanguards of sustained exploration and settlement? Or will they prove to be more like Leif Erickson's voyages, stillborn in the public conception of new lands? No one knows at present but books such as this make a subtle case for many additional voyages of discovery.<br />In the 1960s Kraemer worked for Ford Motor Co., serving as chief engineer for its Space Systems Division and as a manager of its Lunar and Planetary Programs. In this capacity he learned firsthand of the challenges inherent in planetary science programs. Charting the delicate course between the requirements of the scientists for their instruments and the rigid confines of technological systems managed by engineers, he worked on some of NASA most significant missions of the decade. Kraemer moved to NASA Headquarters in 1967 to work on Mars exploration planning efforts, and throughout the first third of the decade of the 1970s he was Director of Planetary Programs. During this period he shepherded to launch many of the illustrious planetary missions that have given rise to the belief that the 1970s was the \\"golden age\\" of planetary science.<br />Because of this deep background, Kraemer's insider account of planetary science in the 1970s is a welcome addition to the history of space exploration. It compares well to other books relating experiences in space science. That is the reason that I agreed to write an introduction for this book.

Even so, Norman Mailer had inspired me since I first read &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; while in high school. At first, &quot;Of a Fire on the Moon&quot; did not attract me, however; it was so existentialist, so counterculture, so Jack Kerouac-esque. It wasn't until the 1990s when I began to explore the cultural history of Project Apollo as an icon of America memory that I returned to &quot;Of a Fire on the Moon&quot; and came to appreciate it's insights.<br />As one of the foremost contemporary American writers, Mailer was commissioned to write about the first lunar landing in the 1960s. What appeared in 1970 was this rather confusing account that is written as almost stream of consciousness ruminations on spaceflight. It provides useful insights, most importantly as Mailer with his 1960s countercultural mindset meets its antithesis, a NASA steeped in middle class values and reverence for the American flag and culture.<br />Mailer was forced in &quot;Of a Fire on the Moon,&quot; grudgingly to admit that NASA's approach to task accomplishment--which he sees as the embodiment of the Protestant Work Ethic--and its technological and scientific capability got results with Apollo. He rails at NASA's closed and austere society, one where he says outsiders are distrusted and held at arm's length with a bland and faceless courtesy that betrays nothing.<br />For all of its skepticism, for all of its esotericism, the book captures powerful insights into rocket technology and the people who produced it in Project Apollo, but it is also heavy going to extract them from this dense book.	2004-04-30

Best known for his work during the 1970s as assistant to Leonard J. Arrington, the Latter-day Saints church historian, Bitton has written many books and essays about Mormonism. This book republishes several of his most significant articles--albeit in a revised form--along with several new essays. As an analysis of Mormon social history it is useful. As a means of understanding a little more about the career of a significant Mormon historian in the latter half of the twentieth century and about the development of a discipline, it is an especially welcome work.<br />Davis Bitton's forte for much of his career has been social history--not necessarily the &quot;New Social History&quot; with its emphasis on the underclass and its reliance on statistical methods--and this book reflects those interests. Bitton's 1973 essay, &quot;Early Mormon Lifestyles; or, The Saints as Human Beings,&quot; demonstrates that most early Mormons spent much of their time concerned about the routine affairs of life in frontier America. In that sense, they were not all that different from most other Americans of their era. This essay, which begins the volume because it deals with the earliest period of Mormon history, is a fitting way in which to start any exploration of LDS society. In the remainder of this interesting work Bitton looks in depth at several themes in the lifestyles and society of Mormonism.<br />Bitton then presents an original essay on the defense of polygamy made by Utah Mormons in the nineteenth century, arguing that from the perspective of a century later &quot;the ideas reviewed in this essay seem to come from another age, another planet. They are from the 'lost world' of Brigham Young and the other outspoken Mormon defenders&quot; (p. 45). He continues with a piece about young people on the Utah frontier, explaining that they rebelled against their parents and their society just as other youth did in other times and places. An analysis of the poetry of southern Utah's Charles Lowell Walker follows, along with a study of the attraction of spiritualism among Mormons of the mid-nineteenth century and the legacy of dancing in LDS society.<br />Two biographical articles offer important interpretations of the meaning of Mormonism in the nineteenth century. The first is Bitton's insightful retelling of the story of Brigham Young  Jr., the man who might have succeeded his father as president of the Latter-day Saint church but for his foibles. The problem of being the child of a great person has long been recognized. Theodore Roosevelt Jr., had to land with the troops at Normandy on D-Day because his father had led the charge up San Juan Hill, but he was never the war hero that his father had been. Brigham Young Jr., likewise, never lived up either to his father's or the Mormon people's expectations in spite of genuine skills and successes.<br />The oldest article republished in this book is &quot;The Exclusion of B. H. Roberts from Congress,&quot; originally appearing in the &quot;Utah Historical Quarterly&quot; in 1957. Seemingly a straightforward political study of the effort to deprive Roberts of the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives that he won in election because of his Mormonism, it betrays some of the concerns Bitton has since expressed about the Latter-day Saints as a people separate from the rest of American society.<br />Finally, the showpiece of this volume is the title essay, originally published in 1975. In &quot;The Ritualization of Mormon History&quot; Bitton shows that Mormon memory is constructed through a complex series of reenactments and recitations of the past. In so doing, the church defines itself and its identity in the context of the world about it. The ritualization process simplifies the story of the church into a morality play with strongly drawn &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; elements. It celebrates the heroic Saints who persevere persecution, the elements, and larger society while largely vilifying those outside the fold. Bitton notes that this ritualization serves an important purpose in the church but is quick to point out that, &quot;those who probe more deeply are bound to discover that the men and women of the past were not that flat and, more essentially, that the past was not that simple.&quot; He adds, &quot;historians have a duty to criticize and correct inaccurate, inadequate, or oversimplified versions of the past Part of their social role is to go over the record more thoroughly than the average person can do, subject each others' scholarship to scrutiny and criticism, and produce works of richness and complexity&quot; (p. 183).<br />There is much to praise and little to criticize in &quot;The Ritualization of History and Other Essays.&quot; Davis Bitton argues his case well and offers a set of essays that hang together as social history remarkably well for works written over such a broad period. There are, however, built-in difficulties with any collection of essays of this type. The most important is the choice of what to include and what to exclude from the volume. As a result, themes and events are unevenly represented. There is, for instance, very little on any aspect of Mormonism in the twentieth century despite some pathbreaking personal essays and historiographical discussions that Bitton has written over the years.

The author uses some of the tools of the &quot;new historicism&quot; and the deconstruction of texts to analyze the efforts of several citizens' groups in the Great Basin in the late 1970s and early 1980s to defeat the proposal of the U.S. Air Force to base a new ICBM in the region. The Air Force said the new ICBM, called the MX for a time but later named by Ronald Reagan in 1981 the &quot;peacekeeper&quot; to emphasize its deterrent capability, would ensure the safety of the United States from the Soviet threat. Deploying it in the Great Basin made sense, said the Air Force, because of its vast expanse of under-populated and under-used federal lands. The MX project also offered jobs to the region, something that was attractive to many politicians and business leaders. In spite of this, a coalition of divergent interests--principally ranchers, environmentalists, Western Shoshones, and Mormons--organized to oppose the deployment and persuaded the Reagan administration to site the MX elsewhere.<br />Glass's effort to analyze this important episode in western and U.S. history is only partly successful. His first three chapters describe reasonably well the opposition to the MX in the region. In them he makes good use of interviews with key opponents of the MX and of records from groups organized to battle the Air Force. These are the most useful portions of the book. His last three chapters seek to deconstruct the public discourse and analyze the successful opposition of citizens to government initiatives. Using especially the theories of Jurgen Habermas, Glass finds that there is a way for citizens to affect the debate over public policy.<br />At the same time, however, Glass never makes any serious attempt to present either the Air Force perspective on the effort or the positions of other federal agencies, none of which was monolithic and sometimes stood in opposition one to another. Glass tried to explain away this fact in his introduction by commenting that he was unable to contact any Air Force personnel because &quot;if still in service, [they] had taken up subsequent assignments in other parts of the country&quot; (p. xxii) .This is an unsatisfactory answer, for virtually all of them could have been reached by telephone simply by obtaining their assignment numbers from Headquarters USAF's personnel office. In addition, the author could have benefited substantially from documentary research at the Air Force Historical Research Center in the Air University in Montgomery, Alabama, where official records are maintained. As a result, this is a highly one-sided and far from definitive discussion of the episode.<br />Indeed, the author even seems to offer conclusions that are not sup- ported by the evidence when dealing with the government's attitude about MX basing. One example from p. 102 should suffice for what seems to be a pattern that arises every few pages. In 1980 Undersecretary of the Air Force Antonia Chayes replied to an anti-MX editorial written by University of Utah law professor Edwin B. Firmage in the Salt Lake Tribune with a handwritten note to the paper. Glass uses that note to support something that at least the portions he quoted did not demonstrate. In it Chayes applauded the &quot;positive and stimulating&quot; dialogue the Air Force was engaged in with the citizens of the region. She added, &quot;We are making every effort to consult with the leaders and citizens of the potentially affected areas so as to devise approaches to this vital national undertaking which are compatible with local concerns and values. After all, the Air Force's mission in strategic defense, as in all other areas, is to protect our way of life.&quot; In the next paragraph Glass concludes on the basis of the discussion of Chayes's note that she attempted &quot;to disqualify Firmage as an authoritative source on the real meaning of U .S. strategic policy&quot; and that it &quot;sounded persuasive because it posited a gap between the knowledge available to citizens and that available to the genuine experts.&quot; I do not see how the quoted portions of Chayes's note provide evidence for Glass's conclusion.<br />The full story of the MX basing controversy has yet to be written.

It is a useful work that makes available to historian and buff alike several fascinating letters and diaries written by women involved in the westward movement of the 1840s. The editor, Kenneth L. Holmes and the publisher have undertaken an ambitious project, and, this work, and others in this series, represent a benchmark in this field's historiography.<br />The material presented in this first volume has been arranged by the editor into twelve chapters with entries by fourteen women. These accounts are representative rather than exhaustive. However, there are important documents discussing the experiences of several intelligent and articulate women on the Oregon, California, Santa Fe, and Mormon trails. The editor chose his documents well. They are all primary resources, written at the time of the incidents described or immediately thereafter. More important, Holmes did not reprint commonly used diaries. I was pleasantly surprised that Susan Magoffin's diary of her trip to Santa Fe in 1846 was not included in the collection. It is an outstanding diary but readily available elsewhere. Instead, Holmes scoured the nation's archives and libraries, and solicited copies of documents from individuals, to assemble what should be considered an exemplary collection of manuscripts.<br />Holmes's editorial work is also outstanding. He allows the individual writers to tell their own story without correcting grammar, punctuation, and syntax. He adds, moreover, useful annotations providing additional background information about key personalities and events without overediting, certainly no easy task judging from the number of edited works that suffer from this defect.<br />The editor gives considerable attention to Mormon women during the westward trek to Utah. Holmes includes as a major piece within the collection a diary of Patty Bartlett Sessions, dated June 21, 1847, through September 26, 1847. The original, located in the Historical Department of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has been well used by scholars investigating the Mormon trek to Utah, the role of women in the Church and in western history, and the development of medical treatment, but its publication for a wider audience is most welcome.<br />While \\"Covered Wagon Women\\" is a fine book of lasting historical value, it could have been made better with additional work. For instance, the editor chose to omit both a bibliography and an index, opting for the issuance of a cumulative bibliography and index in the tenth volume of the series. This decision will, of course, make the volume less usable by researchers in the interim. Additionally, Holmes is inconsistent in his editorial work. He is at his best in his treatment of the diary of Patty Sessions. First, it has an excellent introduction that draws heavily upon the research of such leaders in the study of Mormon women on the frontier as Leonard J. Arrington and Maureen Ursenbach Beecher. Second, it includes a useful dramatis personae, briefly describing characters mentioned in the diary. Finally, Holmes attaches a solid bibliography pointing the direction for further study. In contrast, Holmes's editing of other diaries and letters possesses nothing approaching the depth of scholarship he demonstrates in his work on Sessions. Most other entries contain only a cursory introduction, and none has either a description of characters or bibliography. It would have been commendable had Holmes been able to bring to the other accounts in this volume the fine editorial work he displays in his work on the Sessions diary.<br />In spite of these shortcomings, Kenneth Holmes has compiled a well-balanced, enjoyable book that should be of interest to all readers concerned withthe study of women, the frontier movement, the overland trail, and Mormonism. This type of documentary history, although until recent years considered somewhat esoteric, should be encouraged, for it can open entirely new avenues of investigation when handled by skilled historians.the study of women, the frontier movement, the overland trail, and Mormonism.

What a Bizarre Story	This is a horror story worthy of anything Stephen King could write. Tragically, it is not fiction. Jeffrey D. Lundgren and his followers in Kirtland, Ohio, former members of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, renamed in 2001 the Community of Christ, killed in cold blood the Avery family on April 17, 1989, and buried their bodies in the floor of a barn. They then went into West Virginia \\"to see God.\\" Not until a rainy morning the next January did the police, acting on a tip from one of the group's disenchanted members, learn about the murders. A search for Lundgren's group took place and within a short time they had all either been captured or turned themselves in to law enforcement authorities. Lundgren was tried for murder and sentenced to death in Ohio in September 1990; many of his followers were also given lengthy prison sentences.<br />Indeed, \\"Prophet of Death\\" is a unique, interesting, and distressing book.<br />Its story really begins in 1969 with the attendance of Lundgren at Central Missouri State University where he met his wife and accomplice in these crimes. It recites their life together for the next fifteen years: a rocky marriage, religious conservatism in the Reorganized Church, inability to earn a livelihood, and sexual misconduct of the most perverse nature.<br />It then discusses the Lundgrens' move to Kirtland, where they worked as volunteer guides at the Kirtland Temple and built a following of unhappy Reorganized Church members, which eventually became a cult. Finally, it recites the history of the cult that Lundgren headed and the events before and after the Averys' murders. Peter Earley, a journalist, conducted many hours of interviews with people who were involved in the case, and his research is illuminating. I doubt that any other investigator will be able to uncover much more of interest about it. He also tells a good story, and the fifty-six chapters read quickly, even if it is a shocking account.<br />As a narrative of events about the case, this is a useful work. Even if readers are already aware of the primary facts of the Lundgren affair, the book will enlighten much further. Most probably will agree with one person who is quoted in the book as saying that \\"what he was preaching was simply nuts\\" (p. 159).<br />Unfortunately, Earley's work fails to satisfy. While his narrative is fast-paced, it never gets at the central question of why these events took place. There is almost no context for how and why Lundgren twisted theological conceptions into bizarre expressions. While there is mention of the difficulties within the Reorganized Church over women's ordination, there is little appreciation of that as a symptom of larger problems and their significance for the membership.<br />There is also no understanding whatsoever of the church's history and the various factions of Mormonism. He consistently, for example, uses the term \\"Mormon\\" in reference to the Reorganized Church in spite of that term's clear identification with the Latter-day Saint movement based in Utah. He refers to blood atonement, as well, but there is no explanation or even an appreciation of its historical and theological evolution. I should add that blood atonement has never been any part of any aspect of the Reorganization, and Lundgren even improperly used the term to describe his actions when compared to nineteenth-century doctrine. There is definitely a need for an explanation of how and why such a grotesque contortion of church history and theology could take place.<br />\\"Prophet of Death\\" also has numerous errors of fact. Even relatively small facts are incorrectly reported. For instance, the year that the Avery family's bodies were discovered is incorrect on the dust jacket. I recognize that errors creep into books in a variety of ways, but the overbearing weight of them makes me question the author's attention to detail. In addition, many readers will deplore the complete lack of references andthe reliance of the author on interviews, sometimes with unspecified individuals. That is not an uncommon complaint. The fine work of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in \\"All the President's Men\\" could be criticized on similar grounds. Like that earlier work in investigative journalism, it may not have been possible to write Prophet of Death without confidential interviews, but I would like to know the sources. The author also uses pseudonyms for some individuals in the book to protect their privacy. While the reasons for this decision were undoubtedly weighed carefully and probably made perfect sense in our litigant society, I lament this aspect of contemporary nonfiction writing. Earley also did not bother to include an index for this book, an absolute must for any work of nonfiction.d the reliance of the author on interviews, sometimes with unspecified individuals.

US	36818999	R2UMKICOI01ZZB	0226508935	305783320	Modern American Religion, Volume 1: The Irony of It All, 1893-1919	Books	5	3	3	N	N	An Outstanding Study of Modern American Religion	The dust jacket of the original hardcover edition of this book has a photograph of Martin E. Marty, one of the deans of American religious history, grinning like the Chesire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. He has reason to grin, for this book was the impressive first fruits of a projected four-volume chronicle of American religion in the twentieth century. It offers a unique interpretation of the nation's religious history. Marty contends that religion in twentieth century America has been shaped, essentially, by its contact with the modern world and all that this contact implies.<br />In this volume Marty explores the diverse ways in which American religion and religious leaders embraced, rejected, or cautiously accepted what he called &quot;modernity.&quot; Some, the anti-modernists, self-consciously preserved older ways against the onslaught of new ideas such as Darwinism, socialism, and a host of other &quot;isms&quot; which were viewed as contrary to the \\"truth of the gospel.\\" Others, such as the progressives of the early twentieth century, embraced the modern world and sought to make it their own through such vehicles as the social gospel. A few reached an uneasy alliance with modern America, seeking to channel what they considered the best the new society offered into areas they believed would be most advantageous to their followers and the larger religious community. Within this larger framework, Marty narrates a story that begins with the World's Parliament of Religions at the Columbian Exposition of 1893 and ends at the conclusion of World War I, as the nation returned to &quot;normalcy.&quot; The author figuratively follows the participants in the World 's Parliament of Religions in their various spiritual arenas, recording the story of individuals and movements which shaped and directed American religion in the early part of this century.<br />At the heart of his study, as it should be with all historical inquiry, are the people themselves. Marty sees much to appreciate in all of the reactions to modernity by various leaders: the progressivism of &quot;modernists&quot; like William Rainey Harper; the unique mixture of religion and secularity found in the lives and thoughts of Henry Adams, George Santayana, and John Dewey; the transforming spirit of ethnicity in religion among Indian, African American, and other minority groups; and the anti-modern conceptions of such revivalists as Dwight L. Moody and Billy Sunday. Whether they embraced the modern world or not, whether they attempted to pass beyond the modern world to a more basic religious stance unaffected by it or not, Marty perceives each of these individuals and each of the groups as representative of the fascinating kaleidoscope of the nation's religious makeup. Although religious groups are diverse, each offers an essential ingredient to the whole, thereby making our spiritual lives a little richer.<br />Marty argues that a healthy irony marked these decades in American religious history. He notes that however strenuously the individuals or groups may have struggled with modernity--or embraced it--the outcomes of their efforts were often quite different from what had been intended. In spite of the wide chasms between intentions and results, Marty believes that these people and movements decisively shaped the religious and secular world that followed which we too often take for granted.<br />While this is an important first attempt to synthesize the religious history of the period--and indeed the whole twentieth century--it suffers from common errors which infect all historical writing. In a lengthy section on the Latter-day Saints of Utah (pp. 301-305), for example, Marty contends that the Mormon Church accommodated itself to modern America about the I time of Utah's entry into the Union in 1896. Clearly this is an oversimplification, as Thomas G. Alexander's &quot;Mormonism in Transition: A History of the Latter-day Saints, 1890-1930&quot; (University of Illinois Press, 1986) points out. But this and other overstatements, misreading of documents, and oversimplifications are minor irritations.<br />Marty's book is an important work which offers an interesting and challenging, if not always convincing, assessment of American religion during the formative years of this century. Its value, however, may be more in offering a useful technique for understanding the period than for being comprehensive in chronicling the history of religious movements. It is lively and sometimes humorous. It can be read profitably and appreciated by all--as a useful contribution to the study of twentieth century religious development.nois Press, 1986) points out.

US	36818999	R3FJGSNCL9CUM1	1586852620	880598749	Utah, the Right Place (Revised and Updated Edition)	Books	4	3	9	N	N	An Excellent Start, but not the Last Word in Utah History	I have long been wary of any book that uses the term &quot;official&quot; and &quot;history&quot; in its title. It connotes a certain sense of self-adoration and celebration at best and exhibits rather blatant spin-doctoring and perhaps even untruth at worst. If any historian could write an outstanding official history, however, it is Thomas G. Alexander, one of the leading historian of the Great Basin. Because of his skill, he often succeeds here, but the blinders of centennial celebration and religious heritage limit what could have been a magnificent synthesis to what is merely a good one.<br />&quot;Utah, The Right Place&quot; was commissioned by the state government in commemoration of the centennial of statehood. In a fit of largesse, the state legislature appropriated funds for this overview, a four-volume chronological history each written by a different scholar, histories of each Utah county, and several other publications and events. In this new state history, Alexander presents Utah as a crossroads where cultures met, conflicted, assimilated, and ultimately changed forever. Although there is some discussion of aboriginal peoples, the vast majority of the book deals with the cultural interaction between European-Americans and Native Americans, as well as between various groups of European-Americans. Alexander heavily emphasizes the period since 1847, with well over three/fourths of the book dealing with this chronological period.<br />A group that is both overrepresented and handled with a surprisingly positive alacrity is the Mormons. No doubt the members of the Mormon church have fundamentally influenced the development of Utah since 1847, but Alexander's too-easy acceptance of the church's conventional position is troubling. For instance, with the many other issues appropriate for this state history given incomplete treatment or omitted altogether, presumably because of space limitations, why does Alexander devote nearly a chapter to a narrative of Mormon origins and development prior to the 1846 exodus to Utah? And, having chosen to do so, why is the treatment so reflective of the Mormon leadership's beliefs about the church's origins?<br />Alexander, as a believing, practicing Mormon, handles most Mormon issues in this Utah history in a &quot;faithful&quot; manner, in most instances reflecting the church's beliefs about itself. A notable example of Alexander stepping beyond his religious convictions, however, is his use of the lessons of the Mountain Meadows Massacre to chide present-day mid-level Mormon officials about overzealous execution of presumed policies from the church leadership. In 1857, a combined Mormon and Paiute party brutally murdered a wagon train of Arkansans stopped at Mountain Meadows in southern Utah who were on their way to California. At the time, middle-management Mormon John D. Lee misinterpreted comments from Brigham Young and his chief lieutenants about possible war with the United States as a license to carry out this heinous crime, and successfully covered up the church's involvement for a number of years. Twenty years after the fact, Lee was executed for his role in the massacre but no one else was punished; in ritualistic manner he became a Christ-like figure absolving Mormonism of its great crime through his blood sacrifice.<br />Alexander uses this event as a launching pad to deride extremism among the Mormons. Presently, the church has publicly broken with its intellectual community and demanded complete subservience to an increasingly narrow party line. The church's middle-managers have zealously excommunicated some of the best-known Mormon intellectuals, and the question has been repeatedly asked, &quot;Who is responsible for this crackdown?&quot; Are local church officials taking obscure cues from high Mormon leaders or acting under their direct orders? Such intellectuals as Alexander probably hope that it represents incorrect cue-taking from higher officials, and he suggeststhis is improper. It happened in 1857, and the Mountain Meadows Massacre was the result. At one point, he wrote of the massacre, &quot;Such underlings will abuse and murder others if they believe their leaders really want them to do so. Neither James Buchanan nor Brigham Young wanted people to suffer or die needlessly, but...[their underlings] believed that their leaders really did want these things to happen&quot; (p. 133). They acted on that belief. Alexander might well conclude, just as surely as in 1857, that underlings in the present Mormon church have acted to punish intellectuals.<br />There are difficulties in the book, despite its usefulness overall. For instance, Alexander is at best cursory in his discussion concerning the development of air transportation and the aerospace community in Utah. A fair amount of U. S. western history has much to do with transportation, and in the twentieth century the air transport structure has been critical to regional development. Utah leaders were early and persistent advocates of air transportation, yet this area is barely mentioned. Likewise, the rise of large-scale aerospace activities in Utah-Morton Thiokol, Hercules Powder Co., and others-receive superficial treatment. These activities have fundamentally transformed the state's economic, and to some extent the political and social, landscape and cry out for analysis. At the same time, lengthy, but less important, discussions of sports teams in Utah, complete with photographs of sports celebrities, grace several pages.<br />Despite my apprehensions about what is missing in the book, there is much to praise in &quot;Utah, The Right Place.&quot; It is a serviceable state history that emphasizes the themes of the &quot;new social history&quot;-race, ethnicity, class, and gender-and the &quot;new western history&quot; with its emphasis on social and environmental issues. It is sympathetic without being hagiographic, and Alexander's conclusions are usually well-measured.

US	36818999	R2XAQF7GRFMSWJ	0870620355	725168372	Utah Expedition, 1857-1858: A Documentary Account	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Good Collection, but Some Missing Documents	Known variously as \\"Buchanan's Blunder,\\" the \\"Mormon War,\\" and the \\"Contractor's War,\\" the U.S. Army's expedition to Utah during 1857-1858 was a significant event for all involved. The republishing of the documentary history of this important military operation is also significant, for it makes available once again an impressive collection of key documents. Originally issued in 1958, this account--while neither exhaustive nor fully representative of the extensive records available--contains many valuable official records and an impressive sampling of privately held documents.<br />The editors, LeRoy R. Hafen and Ann B. Hafen, both members of the Mormon church and acclaimed as leading authorities of frontier America, arrange the material into eleven chapters touching upon the most critical issues of the expedition. They provide the general orders which authorized the expedition; an account of the mission of Captain Stewart Van Vliet, sent to Utah to scout the territory and acquire necessary provisions for the army; the reports of Colonel Edmund B. Alexander, the senior officer of the advance troops destined for Utah; the diaries of members of the expedition; documents bearing upon Albert Sidney Johnston's movement into winter quarters at Fort Bridger; the reactions of the Mormons and Congress to the expedition; Thomas L. Kane's effort to negotiate a settlement; Governor Alfred Cumming's reports and correspondence concerning the affair; and documents dealing with the Utah Peace Commission.<br />The Hafens have chosen their documents well and have annotated them to provide additional background information. Annotation prevents the over-editing which has caused many documentary collections to suffer. This modest and fair appraisal of the controversial expedition is also still as valid today as it was when first published twenty-seven years ago. Yet although the Hafens have avoided over-editing, there are hazards to under-editing as well. On this point The Utah Expedition could have benefited from additional work. For instance, the editors chose to ignore the immediate causes of friction between the United States government and the people of Utah. The only apparent reasons for this military operation are those described in the letters of federal officials W.F.M. Magraw and W.W. Drummond, which unnecessarily charged the Mormons with open rebellion against the United States. The editors reproduce these without introduction or annotation. As a result, the expedition seems to take place without justification. The editors also make no attempt to document the important political implications of the expedition, such as the intriguing way in which Senator Stephen A. Douglas used the expedition to political advantage. The Buchanan administration's secrecy concerning this expedition also led to unfortunate suppositions from the Mormons, and this misunderstanding and confusion combined to create a volatile situation. Documentary evidence to demonstrate the reasons behind the administration's approach would have been helpful.<br />It is also regrettable that the editors did not extend their research into other collections that could have yielded still more valuable documents. In the National Archives, for example, is a letter dated 26 May 1857 from General-in-Chief Winfield Scott to Secretary of War John B. Floyd in which Scott recommended postponing the campaign until 1858 because of logistics and the hazards of winter in the Rockies. Thus Scott correctly anticipated the army's most serious difficulties during the expedition. The letter of instruction of 29 June 1857 from Scott to Brevet Brigadier General William S. Harney is also an important document which could have benefited this collection, for it describes clearly the mission's problems and suggests tactical movements. Finally, the editors might have included some of the documents in the Indian War Veterans Collection of the Utah State Archives in Salt Lake City. This collection contains dozens of manuscripts which portray the Utah militia's operations during this period. Perhaps the most important of these was Special Order Number 13 issued by the militia's commander on 13 August 1857; it directed a cavalry force of more than three hundred men \\"to go back upon the road [in Echo Canyon, the principal route into Utah] to protect our immigration now en-route to this city.\\"<br />In spite of these criticisms, \\"The Utah Expedition\\" continues to stand as a notable achievement. The elements of the adventure-the expedition's initial activities, the reactions in Congress and in Utah, the Mormon efforts at resistance, Thomas Kane's heroic conciliation mission, Governor Cumming's good intentions, and the final settlement--all find illustration in well-selected journals, letters, government documents, and newspaper accounts.s dozens of manuscripts which portray the Utah militia's operations during this period.

Fawn Brodie's 1945 biography, \\"No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith,\\" Leonard Arrington's 1958 \\"Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints,\\" Robert Flanders's 1965 \\"Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi,\\" Leonard Arrington's and Davis Bitton's 1979 \\"The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints,\\" and D. Michael Quinn's 1987, \\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World View,\\" are all in this category. They have become classics of Mormon studies, creatively reevaluating historical perceptions and affecting in a unique way the studies that followed. \\"The Refiner's Fire\\" may be in the same category.<br />\\"The Refiner's Fire\\" ranges broadly to place Joseph Smith and the rise of a new religious tradition squarely within a fresh context that incorporates many of the elements explored by students of Mormonism for the last four decades into a new historical synthesis. Brooke is concerned with Mormon origins, especially the elements that came together to make the Restoration movement such a powerful and compelling force in the 1830s and 1840s.<br />In a narrative that is much more persuasive than most when approached with an inquiring mind, Brooke argues that Mormon doctrine and cosmology originated neither in Puritan New England nor as a result of the Second Great Awakening that took place largely on the American frontier of the early nineteenth century. Instead, he places the church's ideological roots in Europe in the period of the sixteenth century Reformation, where a core element of religious dissenters questioned traditional Christian concepts and found solace in the hermetic occult.<br />The author contends that the connections between the occult and the sectarian ideal of restoration with Mormonism helped to forge an exceptionally attractive religious movement throughout the Western world. Integral to this was hermeticism, which claims that humanity could regain the lost and pure world of Adam through the development of a special relationship to God based on religious ritual and sacrifice. The belief in the occult, which had been exceptionally powerful in Europe between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, had been manifested especially in non-Catholic religions, magic, witchcraft beliefs, Freemasonry, and a host of everyday activities that were accepted as part of the human experience. They ranged from a belief in the visitation of angels to the far more sinister casting of spells on enemies.<br />Much of this acceptance of the supernatural as an everyday occurrence was lost in the rationality of the \\"Enlightenment\\" of the seventeenth century, and our present secular belief system is largely predicated on those ideas. It did not have to be that way, as this book makes clear. Joseph Smith challenged that rational system in fundamental ways when he contended that God was not \\"knowable\\" through reason, but only through the supernatural. His \\"First Vision\\" was central to that challenge--as was his translation of the Book of Mormon--and his continued reliance on nonrational knowledge thereafter incorporated a fundamental occult tradition into the movement he founded. Brooke brings together an analysis of Mormonism's occult origins in folk magic with its later expression in unique theological ideals.<br />\\"The Refiner's Fire\\" is an important study that will not be comfortable reading for some within the Latter-day Saint tradition. But it should be read, even though its celebration of a radical, supernatural, nonrational, religious tradition of European hermetic purity and danger will be discomforting to those who wish the modern Latter-day Saint church to be a mainstream religious institution. Joseph Smith's assertions more than 170 years ago about angelic visitations, prophetic ministry, Zionic community-building, and a restoration of the gospel in its ancient purity was a unique and powerful message in the emergent United States. \\"The Refiner's Fire\\" helps to explain some of that power, for Smith's efforts hit at the center of humanity's desire to know something that is ultimately unknowable through secular rationality.ionic community-building, and a restoration of the gospel in its ancient purity was a unique and powerful message in the emergent United States. \\"The Refiner's Fire\\" helps to explain some of that power, for Smith's efforts hit at the center of humanity's desire to know something that is ultimately unknowable through secular rationality.	2004-04-11

As a collection of previously published essays on a single theme, this book also contains a wealth of thought about the religious concerns of American society.<br />Long explores the use of signs and other types of imagery as indicators of religious health. He notes this in his introduction: \\"The religion of any people is more than a structure of thought: it is experience, expression, styles, and rhythms. Its first and fundamental expression is not in the level of thought. It gives rise to thought, but a form of thought that embodies the precision and nuances of its source.\\" Accordingly, he defines his subject with broad strokes and seeks to illuminate the whole of American religious experience from his investigations.<br />Of special importance in the essays in Long's concern about understanding and interpreting the religious heritage of African Americans. As an African American in the United States, he confides that the work presented here is largely an attempt to \\"make sense of my life\\" (p. 8). In each essay he seeks to explore the possibilities of thought rooted in the religious experience born of black traditions.<br />One of the most important concepts Long expresses is his belief that Americans of all backgrounds must develop a religious theology of freedom. Such movements have arisen periodically in the nation's history, most notably in the evangelical crusade against slavery in the decades before the American Civil War and the civil rights crusade of the 1950s-1970s. He asserts that opportunities for such a theology of freedom abound, and concludes: \\"The visibility of the black community in American is out challenge and our opportunity to develop a theology of freedom-a freedom for humanity-a new humanity\\" (p. 141).<br />Not all readers will easily grasp Long's complex analysis. He fills this powerful and thought-provoking with jargon and elusive ideas that require careful unpacking. But his thoughtful, compassionate attempt to merge the study of the history of religious thought with the consideration of current issues and symbols makes this a worthy book for serious contemplation.es for such a theology of freedom abound, and concludes: \\"The visibility of the black community in American is out challenge and our opportunity to develop a theology of freedom-a freedom for humanity-a new humanity\\" (p. 141).<br />Not all readers will easily grasp Long's complex analysis.

One could argue that the ability to fly is the critical technology of the twentieth century and airports are a critical piece of the infrastructure of this technology. Anyone who has spent hours cooling their heels in airports--and who hasn't--will attest to their significance.<br />Now Janet Bednarek, one of the permier historians of aviation in America, has written a book on the rise of these institutions from their origins as grass strips to the paved runways and terminals that offered a variety of amenities. In so do, she chronicles the development of airways, air traffic control systems, and the other components of airports from restaurants to rental car agencies.<br />A core part of Bednarek's book is its discussion of how the airports started as private endeavors and evolved into huge government institutions with local, state, and federal involvement. How and why this took place is a critical element in the history of aviation in the United States. At a fundamental level, this resulted from the seizing of the technology of the airplane for government purposes through the air mail, military operations, etc. Additionally, the cost of operating the technology ensured that it could not remain a wholly private endeavor and that public funds had to be invested for the advancement of the air system. Most Americans accepted this as an important investment in the future of the nation and did not question these expenditures.<br />By 1947, Bednarek concludes, the basic system of public/private involvement in the airport infrastructure had been solidified and that is where she ends her study. I hope she will continue it in another book, bringing the history of American airports up to the recent past.	2004-03-03

She describes preparations for the flight, the actual launch, orbital flight with its characteristic weightlessness, and the return to Earth when the shuttle lands like an airplane on a runway.<br />As an example of how she approaches this subject. She writes that at launch plus six minutes: \\"The force pushing us against the backs of our seats steadily increases. We can barely move because we're being held in place by a force of 3 g's--three times the force of gravity we feel on Earth. At first we don't mind it--we've all felt much more than that when we've done acrobatics in our jet training airplanes. But that lasted only a few seconds, and this seems to go on forever. After a couple of minutes of 3 g's, we're uncomfortable, straining to hold our books on our laps and craning our necks against the force to read the instruments. I find myself wisping we'd hurry up and get into orbit.\\" Then she describes how, at about eight minutes after launch, the engines cut off and she is weightless in Earth orbit.<br />This book is a treat for young readers. It captures the excitement and mystery of space exploration as only a veteran astronaut--one who is both reflective and committed to the education of young people--can relate it.

Howard. As such it is court history in every sense of the word. The author seeks to cast a sheen of positiveness throughout, despite some very specific areas that cause difficulty in Mormon history. That said, there are some worthy sections of he book, which is more a collection of essays that a unified historical study.<br />For example, Howard offers a pointed discussion of the church in Kirtland, Ohio, between 1831 and 1838, suggesting that the RLDS interpretation of Kirtland as a prototype of \\"moderate Mormonism\\" and therefore the model for the Reorganization as it emerged in the 1850s and 1860s, is an idealized image. Howard notes, \\"RLDS 'defenders of the faith' have too long portrayed the Kirtland Saints of the 1830s as 'larger than life.' The time has come to relieve ourselves and our ancestors of such an unfair burden. The task is neither more nor less than trying to discern something of Kirtland's truth.\\"  He calls for, but does not himself deliver, a fundamental reinterpretation of the Kirtland experience. Instead, he relates the same basic commentary that has been taught for more than twenty years.<br />For example, much of the information on the development of the scriptural record that Howard includes in the Kirtland chapter is drawn from research more than a generation old. Howard's discussion of the critically important Kirtland Safety Society anti-Bank-ing Company, moreover, is simplistic and apologetic. Consisting of only two paragraphs, this section fails to explain satisfactorily the Kirtland economy and the Mormon desire for a bank, omits details of the effort to charter and run the bank, assigns responsibility for the bank failure solely to the Panic of 1837 with no more than a sentence's worth of discussion, and passes off the negative reaction to the bank with a simple, \\"Because Joseph was instrumental in the venture, he and other church leaders received severe criticism for the bank's demise.\\"<br />Likewise, Roward Howard's discussion of plural marriage in the early history of the Mormon church is less than satisfactory. Assignment of responsibility for the origination of the doctrine, with all of its sexual impropriety overtones, has been hotly contested. Until the early 1980s the Reorganized Church, the second largest of the Mormon factions, officially denied that Joseph Smith Jr. had been the author of plural marriage and asserted that it had been started by Brigham Young and was evidence of apostasy. This began to change in a fundamental way only after the 1983 publication of an article by Richard Howard that viewed plural marriage as something that arose in Nauvoo as an historical accident which grew like topsy near and immediately after the death of Joseph Smith Jr. The author repeats this interpretation here, as misguided as it is because of its conservatism and inability to deal with Joseph Smith's indiscretions that came as early as the 1830s.<br />Overall, this is a worthwhile but flawed collection of essays on several aspects of the history of the early church from its origins in 1830 through the Joseph Smith Jr. era, to the reorganization of the church in the 1850s and the accession of Joseph Smith III in 1860.on to the bank with a simple, \\"Because Joseph was instrumental in the venture, he and other church leaders received severe criticism for the bank's demise.\\"<br />Likewise, Roward Howard's discussion of plural marriage in the early history of the Mormon church is less than satisfactory.

Most people assign that distinction either to the old Washington Senators (3 pennants, 1 world championship in nearly 60 years) or to the St. Louis Browns (1 pennant in more than 50 years), but for my money the Kansas City Athletics were worse. They never finished higher than 6th in the American League, their first year in KC, and finished in the cellar 5 times.<br />This book is the story of that team, but it is really one about exploits off the field well captured in this fascinating new book. The business of baseball is well served in this study, for it shows much about how MLB teams are organized and promoted, and winners are built.<br />Arnold Johnson bought the Athletics from Connie Mack and moved them to Kansas City for the 1955 season. The team then began making so many trades with the New York Yankees, including the famous deal that sent Roger Maris to the Yankees in time to win the MVP award in 1960 and hit *61 homers in 1961. But these famous transactions tell very little about Johnson's success in the trade market. In all, Johnson made sixteen trades with the Yankees in five years, involving sixty-seven players. The author of this book analyzes each of these trades using the Bill James \\"Win Shares\\" system, however, and concludes that Johnson's trade record of 1,572-1,109 was impressive.<br />What Johnson failed to do, John Peterson writes, was to develop a farm system that could produce quality major leaguers. He comments, \\"During this same period [as the trades with the Yankees] the Athletics produced only one player, Lou Klimchock, who became an everyday player in the major leagues....These trades, especially the trades with the Yankees, were blamed for the team's poor record, but the real reason the team failed to improve during the Johnson era was the failure of the Athletics minor league system to produce major league players.\\" (p. 288).<br />After Arnold Johnson's death in 1960 Charles O. Finley purchased the Athletics and quite a lot of the book discusses his hijinks in Kansas City until he finally moved the team to Oakland after the 1967 season. Finley warred with the baseball establishment. He fought with the local sportswriters. He battled the local politicians who refused to give him whatever he wanted. Needless to say, Finley wore out his welcome quickly, and Peterson discusses this aspect of the story in detail.<br />Finley also steamrolled his employees on a regular basis. He was notoriously cheap, engaging in exceptionally public and enormously petty arguments with players over salaries. At the same time, if it was his idea, he could be outrageously paternalistic and generous.<br />But Finley was also full of ideas, and he wanted everyone to hear them and to embrace them and feuded with those who dismissed them. In another strength of this book, Peterson discusses how Finley scrapped the standard issue home white and gray road flannels in favor of colorful uniforms for his players. Clothing them in his favorite colors of Kelly Green and Ft. Knox Gold, the Athletics were the subject of ridicule for years. Only in the 1970s did most of the other major league teams adopt colorful and unusual uniforms. He dressed young women on his ground crew in skimpy costumes. He instituted a mechanical rabbit in Kansas City, complete with a little Athletics uniform, to deliver balls to the umpire during the game. He set up picnic tables beyond the outfield for fans to come and have supper. He placed lights in the dugout so that the fans could see what the team did there. He adopted several ideas from Bill Veeck, including an exploding scoreboard that launched fireworks whenever a Kansas City player hit a homerun. Finley's innovations also included the primetime World Series and the Designated Hitter rule.<br />While in Kansas City Finley invested heavily in the farm system to sign and develop good ballplayers. Acting essentially as his own general manager he signed the stars-especially Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson,Rollie Fingers, Joe Rudi, Bert Campaneris, Rick Monday, and Sal Bando-that carried the Oakland A's to three successive world championships between 1972 and 1974.<br />Peterson also discusses in depth the movement of the Athletics from Kansas City to Oakland. Throughout his ownership of the A's in Kansas City Finley constantly tried to move them elsewhere. Additionally, Finley was always duplicitous about his commitment to Kansas City. Rumors circulated every year that Finley was moving the team, first to Dallas, then to Seattle, then to San Diego, then to \\"who knows where.\\" Finley always publicly denied these rumors, all the while he was negotiating to move the team first to Dallas, then to Seattle, then to San Diego, then to \\"who knows where.\\" By the time of the departure of Finley's A's, few mourned the loss. Missouri Senator Stuart Symington summed up the position of most Missourians about this move, \\"Oakland is the luckiest city since Hiroshima.\\" Peterson has a whole chapter with this title and it gives a blow by blow account of the move.<br />While there is much to praise in this book, there are a few caveats that I must pass on to potential readers. At times the text appears disjointed and incomplete. On a few occasions the author raises what seem to be important issues but fails to explore them satisfactorily. There is also dizzying dichotomy between the on the field exploits of the team and the adventures of the owners, especially Finley.<br />But these are minor criticisms and I recommend this book as a very useful study of the history of the Athletics while they had a cup of coffee in Kansas City enroute from Philadelphia to Oakland.

Michael Quinn, one of the foremost practitioners of the type of work distinguished as the \\"New Mormon History,\\" certainly thinks so. He has assembled in this volume a set of fifteen previously published essays and a short epilogue by B. H. Roberts, all demonstrating most ably the basic trends identified as \\"New Mormon History\\" (to Quinn a broadly descriptive rather than polemical label). He notes that this type of historical analysis seeks to attain a \\"functional objectivity\\" and avoid several \\"deadly sins of traditional Mormon history\\" (viii), among them shying away from critical but controversial topics.<br />\\"New Mormon historians\\" have adopted these as cardinal points against which all historical writing must be measured. The fifteen essays in this volume certainly rise to high there is no question that something important has happened in Mormon historical writing since the 1960s. Indeed, perhaps what has been taking place has been not so much a \\"new\\" approach toward Mormon history as the rapid and sustained professionalization of the field. The distinguishing features of the \\"New Mormon History\\" had been present to some degree long before the 1960s--most assuredly in the work of such early Mormon historians as E. E. Erickson, Joseph A. Geddes, or Nels Anderson--but emphasis on understanding rather than arguing a specific position became dominant during the 1960s. Both the quality and the quantity of the publications taking this approach skyrocketed during the next three decades. This book puts between two covers some of the best of that work.<br />Quinn's introduction briefly sketches these general trends in the text, and endnotes exhaustively reference historiographical trends. While a serviceable preamble to the articles that follow, the introduction could have presented a more substantial and philosophical discussion of the \\"New Mormon History\\" and its role in furthering an understanding of the Mormon past. The essays follow in roughly chronological order, making the book a useful text for classroom use. Taken altogether, the fifteen essays, each written by a different specialist and originally appearing between 1966 and 1983--perhaps the golden age of the New Mormon History--represent a powerful explanation of the larger aspects of Mormon history from its origins.<br />Some narrow and others broadly interpretive, these essays include the first major reassessments of unique topics in the history of the Mormon Church. Many of these pathbreaking studies, however, have since been revised by other historians. With the exception of a couple of instances where the authors have inserted some historiographical discussion into their endnotes, the essays do not comment on specific debates over interpretations. This lack of historiographical context is unfortunate, leaving readers with little understanding of the historians' differing perspectives.<br />Although each of these essays has stood the test of time and can be considered a benchmark study, like most collected works, this book suffers from uneven quality. Some essays are more challenging than others; I found particularly rewarding Thomas G. Alexander's \\"'To Maintain Harmony': Adjusting to External and Internal Harmony,\\" first published in \\"Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought\\" in 1982; Ronald W. Walker's provocative analysis of Mormon militarism, \\"Sheaves, Bucklers, and the State: Mormon Leaders Respond to the Dilemmas of War,\\" which first appeared in \\"Sunstone: that same year; and \\"A Demographic Portrait of the Mormons, 1830-1980\\" by Dean L. May, first published in 1983, which significantly revised early membership numbers and Utah migration figures.<br />In addition, the volume's first essay, Leonard J. Arrington's eloquent plea for serious, professional historical inquiry--\\"The Search for Truth and Meaning in Mormon History\\"--is an important declaration of intellectual independence that present-day historians of Mormonism should embrace just as fully as did thosewho first read it in \\"Dialogue\\" in 1968. His assertion that \\"historians ought to be free to suggest interpretations without placing their faith and loyalty on the line\\" (p. 5) is a central issue in the current restrictive environment. Arrington's conclusion \\"that an intensive study of church history, while it will dispel certain myths or half-myths sometimes perpetuated in Sunday school (and other) classes, builds faith rather than weakens it\\" (p. 6) is especially germane to present debates over the faithfulness of Mormon history that strays from the agreed-upon story. With the current LDS review policy, threat of censorship, and restricted access to the Church Archives, we would do well to listen to such past voices of concern.<br />Any essay collection of this type has built-in difficulties. Although \\"The New Mormon History\\" is an important work encapsulating Mormon history's reinterpretation during the last generation, it views the Mormon experience only through the lens of selected events, institutions, and personalities, leaving huge gaps in the story of Mormonism and representing themes and events unevenly. The Reorganized Church (now Communit of Christ) experience, not even discussed, deserves mention in a book such as this and could have provided a useful counterpoint for analyzing such themes as theological developments, political issues, relations with larger society, and organizational structures. The collection also contains very little discussion of twentieth-century Mormonism. The era is ignored, with the exception of the Alexander and Walker essays, already mentioned, and some spillover of their subjects into the first part of this century in articles by Kenneth L.

His work revolves around nineteenth-century affidavits and interviews about Joseph Smith's early life. D. Philastus Hurlbut, an excommunicated Mormon who in 1833 interviewed Smith's former neighbors in upstate New York, obtained several damaging affidavits which described the Smith family as destitute, lazy, and shiftless, as drunkards and scam artists who dug for buried treasure. These affidavits portrayed Joseph Smith as perpetrating the hoax of Mormonism on an innocent world. Published in 1834 in E. D. Howe's \\"Mormonism Unvailed,\\" this view of the Prophet was accepted as truthful by most non-Mormons until the 1960s.<br />Forty-seven years after the Hurlbut affidavits, in 1880, Frederic G. Mather interviewed nine of Smith's early contemporaries. These by-now elderly people confirmed Hurlbut's basically negative opinions of Joseph Smith. Probably in reaction to Mather's work, in 1881 William H. and E. L. Kelley, Reorganized Church apostles, visited Palmyra and also talked with long-time residents. Their work, published in the \\"Saints' Herald,\\" contradicted the Hurlbut/Mather research on almost every score. They reported that the Smiths, though poor, were hard-working, frugal, and upstanding citizens in the community. In 1888 non-Mormon writer Arthur B. Deming interviewed Joseph Smith's contemporaries in Palmyra one last time before their deaths, and his work verified the Hurlbut/Mather research. Deming's \\"Naked Truths About Mormonism\\" proved almost as significant in fueling anti-Mormon fires as had the Hurlbut affidavits fifty-five years earlier.<br />For the next seventy-five years or so, the polemicists on either side chose whichever set of recollections suited their purposes.<br />Anderson spends much of the book in a sophisticated and legitimate review of investigations of Joseph Smith's reputation made by Richard Lloyd Anderson in a 1970 \\"Brigham Young University Studies\\" article called \\"Joseph Smith's New York Reputation Reappraised.\\" The similarities between the authors' names and the titles of their works are all that the two investigators and their approaches have in common. Rodger Anderson also refutes almost every one of Richard Anderson's arguments, concluding that the article fails because of the \\"misrepresentation of his contents and circumstances surrounding the compilation of the affidavits; failure to consider alternative interpretations for the evidence; and invalid conclusions based on faulty premises\\" (p. 28).<br />Motivated by a desire to defend Joseph Smith, according to Rodger Anderson, Richard Anderson put forth several arguments which were incompatible with the evidence. Richard Anderson suggested that Philastus Hurlbut had written the 1833 affidavits himself. Two of the affidavits were each signed by several Palmyra vicinity residents, and Richard Anderson logically concluded that someone must have written the affidavits and then collected the signatures. In the absence of any countervailing evidence, a reasonable assumption was that Hurlbut had done so. From there, it could be argued with some legitimacy that Hurlbut was a heavy contributor to the individual affidavits as well. Richard Anderson based this accusation in part on the similar words and phrases he found in the various affidavits. As a result, he concluded that Hurlbut unduly influenced those he took affidavits from, and that conclusion has been an accepted part of studies of early Mormonism ever since. Rodger Anderson argues, however, that the affidavits may be similar because each person was asked the same set of questions. Even if Hurlbut did write any or all of the affidavits, Rodger Anderson adds, those being interviewed both signed them and swore before witnesses that they represented their positions.<br />Rodger Anderson concludes that there is no reason not to accept as authentic the affidavits collected by Hurlbut and Deming, or that they were anything other than honest appraisals by people well acquainted with Joseph Smith and his family in upstate New York. While Rodger Anderson does inject some useful skepticism into Richard Anderson's defense of Smith, he makes an either/or assessment with no middle ground. Such a conclusion is just as difficult to accept as is Richard Anderson's. Take, for example, the affidavit Hurlbut took of Willard Chase, from my perspective the most interesting of those first published in 1834. Rodger Anderson says that Richard Anderson distorted the account and then rejected it. While I will not dispute that conclusion, Rodger Anderson's final assessment of Chase's affidavit as a reliable statement has other problems. Chase's affidavit does not mention any firsthand observation of treasure-seeking but shows intense interest in a seerstone Chase said he found while digging a well and then lent to Joseph Smith. He tried to get it back on several occasions, even though he said it was only a \\"curiosity.\\" Why would he be so concerned unless the stone had some special significance attached to it? Indeed, Chase said he wanted the seerstone to use it to see \\"what wonders he could discover by looking in it.\\" Other sources demonstrate that Chase was very much involved in money-digging in the Palmyra area, and he was not being entirely truthful when relating information about the suyoct. His account, while probably generally correct, should not be accepted without careful consideration of all particulars.<br />A significant revelation, at least for me, was Rodger Anderson's conclusion that the Kelleys' 1881 investigation had serious problems as legitimate historical evidence. Unlike Hurlbut and Deming, the two Reorganized Church apostles took no depositions and gave their witnesses no opportunity to read and sign what they wrote. They took notes during their interviews and then later wrote their report. Rodger Anderson went through the published account, as well as the notes from which it was prepared (housed in the Reorganized Church's--now Community of Christ--Library-Archives), and found that the Kelleys apparently had fertile imaginations, for there is only a passing relationship between their notes and the published article.

His conclusion that the Hurlbut/Mather/Deming research generally reflects the opinions of those interviewed without undue influence from those collecting the material seems relatively sound, although I am less sanguine than the author that some of the details of the Smiths' lives related by those interviewed are entirely truthful. Probably most of those interviewed did consider Joseph Smith to be something of a scoundrel and a charlatan, but whether they reached that conclusion before or after the formation of the Church is a significant question quite beyond the parameters of Anderson's study. His handling of the Kelley research was especially effective and must raise additional questions of historical integrity.

Perhaps this study will spark additional research into this subject; such an accomplishment is as worthy an objective as anyone could ask for.dger Anderson adds, those being interviewed both signed them and swore before witnesses that they represented their positions.<br />Rodger Anderson concludes that there is no reason not to accept as authentic the affidavits collected by Hurlbut and Deming, or that they were anything other than honest appraisals by people well acquainted with Joseph Smith and his family in upstate New York. While Rodger Anderson does inject some useful skepticism into Richard Anderson's defense of Smith, he makes an either/or assessment with no middle ground. Such a conclusion is just as difficult to accept as is Richard Anderson's. Take, for example, the affidavit Hurlbut took of Willard Chase, from my perspective the most interesting of those first published in 1834. Rodger Anderson says that Richard Anderson distorted the account and then rejected it. While I will not dispute that conclusion, Rodger Anderson's final assessment of Chase's affidavit as a reliable statement has other problems. Chase's affidavit does not mention any firsthand observation of treasure-seeking but shows intense interest in a seerstone Chase said he found while digging a well and then lent to Joseph Smith. He tried to get it back on several occasions, even though he said it was only a \\"curiosity.\\" Why would he be so concerned unless the stone had some special significance attached to it? Indeed, Chase said he wanted the seerstone to use it to see \\"what wonders he could discover by looking in it.\\" Other sources demonstrate that Chase was very much involved in money-digging in the Palmyra area, and he was not being entirely truthful when relating information about the suyoct. His account, while probably generally correct, should not be accepted without careful consideration of all particulars.<br />A significant revelation, at least for me, was Rodger Anderson's conclusion that the Kelleys' 1881 investigation had serious problems as legitimate historical evidence. Unlike Hurlbut and Deming, the two Reorganized Church apostles took no depositions and gave their witnesses no opportunity to read and sign what they wrote. They took notes during their interviews and then later wrote their report. Rodger Anderson went through the published account, as well as the notes from which it was prepared (housed in the Reorganized Church's--now Community of Christ--Library-Archives), and found that the Kelleys apparently had fertile imaginations, for there is only a passing relationship between their notes and the published article.

Stressing the immediate causes of the accident, McConnell highlighted the pressures to launch, the objections of engineers, and the internal debates on the subject. He argued that NASA leaders caused the disaster by pressing operations officials to launch when they did so that President Ronald Reagan could mention it in that evening's scheduled State of the Union Address. Of course, this was the mission that would have as a crewmember Christa McAullife, the teach in space who had a special lesson from orbit planned for millions of school children.<br />McConnell's accusations made in &quot;A Majot Malfunction&quot; have been condemned by proponents of the Space Shuttle, especially by NASA personnel, but those complaints require more dispassionate, critical, and technically and programmatically informed analysis than has been offered. This book is certainly not the penultimate word on the subject, but it is an important statement of public understanding of the subject not long after the time of the accident.<br />For an analytical, and exceptionally compelling, analysis of the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident readers should review Diane Vaughan, &quot;The Challenger Launch Decision&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 1996). Malcolm McConnell's book is mostly useful as a journalistic account that offers an overview of the accident and the reasons behind it.	2004-01-20

Milton V. Backman Jr.'s, &quot;The Heavens Resound: A History of the Latter-day Saints in Ohio, 1830-1838&quot; was originally conceived as one of the sixteen volumes on Mormon history sponsored by the Latter-day Saint church in commemoration of its sesquicentennial in 1980. Unfortunately, this book is both exhaustive and exhausting. It provides an exceptionally rich base of detailed information about early Kirtland, the Mormon stronghold in Ohio. Backman is a meticulous researcher. No amount of effort was apparently too much to obtain the stray fact; no amount of checking of the documents and the context and the details of the episode was enough. Backman not only surveyed literary sources, but also reviewed census, tax, probate, legal, land ownership, and other government records. In the process he helped to construct a snapshot of Mormonism at Kirtland that had much more depth than ever before. The result is richly detailed if somewhat pedantic coverage of the Mormon church in Ohio between 1830 and 1838.<br />But if Backman's research was voluminous and the facts piled into &quot;The Heavens Resound&quot; immense, they were also too often misleading. He concentrates on the sacred story of the Kirtland years, the religious activities of leading men--and they were all men that Backman emphasized--the revelations of the founding prophet, the doctrines espoused, and the spiritual manifestations taking place in the era. Backman's commitment to telling the sacred story is both honest and obtrusive. He sees the events in Kirtland only through the eyes of faith, explaining the point of view of the institutional church. Too often he acts as Joseph Smith Jr.'s defense attorney, arguing the case on behalf of the founder to revise revelations as he sees fit, to implement policy and doctrine flexibly, to deal harshly with both rivals and upright people holding honest differences of opinion, to create organization structures and make decisions in seemingly incongruous patterns. In that regard, Smith is depicted as being pursued by evil conspirators who brought &quot;vexatious lawsuits&quot; on a persecuted innocent. Backman never gives alternative positions equal time and neither Smith's motives nor his actions are ever challenged, and there is much room to do both when considering his activities.<br />In a few instances Backman ignores facts that contradict the sacred story he is reconstructing for present-day Latter-day Saints. For example, in describing Smith's &quot;Civil War prophecy,&quot; he places it in its &quot;Nullification Crisis&quot; context and then announces its fulfillment in the Civil War three decades later. The implication for Backman, as it has been for so many other believing Latter-day Saints, is that Joseph Smith was a true prophet and that this revelation is firm proof. Backman fails to indicate, however, that the &quot;Civil War prophecy&quot; was given against the backdrop of Mormon millennialism and that its last section states that the predicted war will lead to the overthrow of the United States and the advent of a Zionic theocracy. Viewed in that context, the major point of the prophecy did not come to pass and refutes Backman's suggestions of Smith's prophetic leadership.<br />I wish there were a better book available on the history of Mormonism in Ohio.

Madelon Brunson's &quot;Bonds of Sisterhood&quot; is a useful but not outstanding study of the role of women in the history of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a Mormon spinoff now called the Community of Christ. Although she is highly critical of Reorganization policies affecting women, this book represents a solid effort to document that important subject. Brunson tries, not always successfully, to place the issue of institutional women's organizations into the context of a larger struggle in secular society and to broaden its meaning for the movement.<br />Although the work is hamstrung by its brevity and the abundance of oversimplifications about a complex subject--to say nothing of its lack of such necessary parts of a work of nonfiction as an index--it succeeds in offering some insights about its subject.<br />As one example, Brunson offers an interesting argument about the relationship of women to the reconsideration of scripture and priesthood in the Reorganized Church. She interprets restoration scriptures as being less than equitable toward women because they could not participate in the priesthood. Brunson asks, to what extent did the necessity to find some accommodation for women contribute to a willingness to probe deeply the role of priesthood in the movement, and toward the acceptance of scriptures which sought to allow women to participate more fully? Her answer suggests that women's involvement in this fundamental way was an issue from the very beginnings of the church.<br />As a related issue she analyzes the concern over maintaining separate women's organizations within the church versus trying to incorporate women into the larger institutional structure. Brunson severely criticizes the Reorganization for its hesitancy to allow women greater participation at every level of the church's hierarchical structure, and to point out opportunities for future involvement of women in the life of the church.<br />Her study stops short of considering the Reorganized Church's pivotal 1984 decision to allow the ordination of women, but in other foruma she has questioned the church hierarchy's reliance upon a document carrying the force of revelation to give women the authority she believes they should have enjoyed all along.ps short of considering the Reorganized Church's pivotal 1984 decision to allow the ordination of women, but in other foruma she has questioned the church hierarchy's reliance upon a document carrying the force of revelation to give women the authority she believes they should have enjoyed all along.	2004-01-20

Certainly Joseph J. Trento and Susan B. Trento will tell us in &quot;Prescription for Disaster,&quot; and it won't be pretty for NASA. Not truly an investigation of the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, its authors conducted an in-depth review of the NASA management and research and development system emphasizing the agency's putative &quot;fall from grace&quot; after the Apollo program. They argue that the giants of the 1960s, the people who had successfully managed the lunar program, were gone and had been replaced with government bureaucrats who played the political game and sold the Space Shuttle as an inexpensive program, in the process sowing the seeds of disaster.<br />The Trentos blame the Nixon Administration for politicizing and militarizing the space program. Every NASA administrator since that time, they said, has had to play hard, but against bigger opponents, in both arenas. They argue that the &quot;Challenger&quot; failure was not caused by the O-rings that allowed the explosion of the spacecraft, but by the political system that produced them.<br />To the credit of the authors, this book is well referenced, and most of the material for it came from attributed interviews with key officials, although there is some question about how the materials were used to support the Trentos' thesis. The themes presented in &quot;Prescription for Disaster&quot; require continued scholarly analysis by anyone wishing to understand the Space Shuttle program.<br />Of course, this book is essentially an expose of NASA and the Space Shuttle program, as one would expect in the aftermath of the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident. For a scholarly analysis, and one that is much more effective and compelling, readers should review Diane Vaughan's &quot;The Challenger Launch Decision&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 1996). &quot;Prescription for Disaster&quot; has been far superceded by that book.

Written by Linda King Newell and Valeen Tippetts Avery, this biography of Emma Smith, the wife of Joseph Smith Jr., the Mormon founder, presents a sweeping and dramatic portrait of this remarkable woman.<br />Generally accepted as a pathbreaking book, \\"Mormon Enigma\\" rehabilitated the image of Emma Smith as the obstinate and faith-shirking figure that had long held sway among the Mormons and at the same time debunked the image she enjoyed in Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now the Community of Christ, which she joined in 1860. In that tradition she was \\"holier than thou,\\" a good samaritan who faithfully discharged her responsibilities to ensure that her son, Joseph Smith III, became president of that dissident group. In both instances the result was positive. The book placed Emma Smith into an interpretive framework which taught Mormondom much about its trials and sacrifices, triumphs and tragedies. The work made possible, along with other historical workds, a major reinterpretation of the formative period of Mormonism.<br />This book is must reading for anyone who even pretends to be well-versed in the history of Mormonism.

Carl Sagan was one of the most thoughtful and charismatic scientists of the twentieth century. He is well-known for his work on the PBS series \\"Cosmos,\\" the award-winning show that became the most watched series in public-television history. By more than this, he worked with NASA on numerous projects, including the two Voyager spacecraft that made the \\"Grand Tour\\" of the outer planets in the 1970s and 1980s.<br />He envisioned the ingenius idea of affixing to the Voyager probes a small gold record containing information about this planet, for its potential recovery by an alien species. This book presents a discussion of the conceptionalization and carrying out of the effort to place this gold record on the two Voyager spacecraft sent outside the Solar System. This Voyager Interstellar Record contained digital information on the planet Earth, including photographs, sounds, music, and greetings in more than 40 languages. It was designed to tell an extraterrestrial intelligence who encountered it something about this planet and the life that thrives here, and to give that life form a general idea of where Earth was located in space.<br />This is a wonderful discussion of this effort, and well worth reading. For those who might be interested, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory--manager of the Voyager project--has a web page devoted to the Voyager Interstellar Record located at [...] On it one may find more on the history of the record and the images, sounds, and music that it contains about this, our home planet.	2004-01-14

With the Cold War over in the mid-1990s, and growing commercial use of space by the United States and other countries, many people in the the U.S. military believed that the role of space operations  in the national defense arena needed to be reevaluated. Taking this as their rationale for pursuing this study, the authors outline the shifts in expected military operations in a post-Cold War world, and provide three options for the future military use of space. A \\"minimalist\\" option would have the military rely on partnerships with other government agencies and commercial resources to serve the military. Relying on assets in orbit for military uses operated by other organizations, therefore, would be a central activity in this option. An \\"enhanced\\" option would expand the military's use of space in a variety of areas, and integrate their operational components into the existing military organization of the United States. The third option would establish an \\"aerospace force\\" separate from the other military branches. While they might work jointly with other branches, these autonomous units would also be able to exercise power separately. The book does not provide a recommendation for any of the three options, choosing instead to characterize the strengths and weaknesses of each.	2004-01-14

Hill's \\"Quest for Refuge: The Mormon Flight from American Pluralism\\" (1989) analyzes Mormonism as a movement steeped in disgust for American society and an attempt to build a refuge that would be able to weather a great apocalypse that was soon to come upon the Earth. Those who embraced Mormonism, Hill argued, saw little of worth in American civilization. \\"They wanted a society that would exclude unnecessary choices and would exclude pluralism,\\" he wrote. \\"Above all, they wanted to diminish the secular influences that pluralism engendered\\" (p. 14).<br />The Latter-day Saint movement was founded on a paranoia that the world had gone awry and would subvert or coopt them if it had the chance. The result was an effort to close off the outside world, \\"to revitalize this magical world view [of Medieval society, to] combine it with elements of more traditional Christianity, and [to] establish a theocratic society where the unconverted, the poor, and the socially and religiously alienated could gather and find a refuge from the competing sects and the uncertainties they engendered\\" (p. 17).<br />It is a powerful thesis, masterfully argued and one that should be pondered seriously by all those seeking to understand the early history of Mormonism.<br />I highly recommend this book.

Bushman, was originally conceived as one of the sixteen volumes on Mormon history officially sponsored by the Latter-day Saint church in commemoration of its sesquicentennial in 1980. It is an excellent example of what Mormons would call &quot;faithful history&quot;--an approach that emphasizes the sacred nature of the history of Mormonism--and presents an elegant, eloquent, exacting, and exasperating analysis of the origins of Mormonism through the end of 1830.<br />In this work Bushman deals in an exceptionally faithful manner with the rise of the church, addressing many of the very real thorny historical issues swirling about Mormonism's creation mythology. How convincing his analysis may be is very much a result of whether or not one accepts Joseph Smith as a prophet of God. Bushman does and demonstrates it on virtually every page.<br />For example, Bushman sought to cohere the folk magic tradition of Joseph Smith with his later career as a prophet of God. There seems little doubt now, despite earlier denials, that Joseph Smith engaged in the practice of folk magic and treasure seeking. Bushman seeks to explain away affidavits and other information implicating Joseph Smith in efforts to use folk magic to recover buried treasure--specifically an 1826 account of a court case filed against Joseph Smith for defrauding a Josiah Stowel of money in a treasure hunting scheme--by exploring the larger context of folk magic in early American history and suggesting that Smith originally reflected his times but ultimately transcended them by God's intervention. In the end, Bushman fails to deal satisfactorily with the story of the Book of Mormon's &quot;golden plates&quot; buried in the Earth and presumably recovered by Smith in 1827, asserting rather than demonstrating this story did not originate out of a tradition of folk magic and money digging.<br />Equally significant, Bushman wrestles with the story of the Book of Mormon, specifically its origins and message. He plays off the comments of Disciples of Christ minister Alexander Campbell, who published the first genuine criticism of the book in 1831. In it Campbell commented that the Book of Mormon dealt with &quot;every error and almost every truth discussed in New York for the last ten years.&quot; For this to be possible, of course, the Book of Mormon could not have been a sacred translation of ancient scripture but a modern work written by Joseph Smith. Bushman explicitly takes issue with this position and argues that the republican tendencies that were everywhere present in the early American nation were absent from the Book of Mormon. Indeed he suggests that the scripture was strangely distant from the social and political milieu of the U.S. in 1830. He sees more &quot;Old World&quot; perspectives than early American thought in the book.<br />&quot;Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism&quot; is an interesting and provocative defense of the sacred story. Bushman is an elegant historian with a special skill in defending the faith story. That his arguments are as successful as they are is a measure of his historical versimilitude. While it is an important synthesis, Bushman's book will be acceptable mostly to believing Mormons.qually significant, Bushman wrestles with the story of the Book of Mormon, specifically its origins and message.

There was never a NASA program, clandestine or otherwise, to bring women into the astronaut corps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. We can debate whether or not NASA leaders should have been open to appointing women astronauts, but the reality was that such an expansion of the astronaut corps never even crossed their minds at the time. Additionally, Stephanie Nolen was not the first to \\"track down\\" and interview the women who undertook physical tests identical to those of the Mercury Seven astronauts. Margaret A. Weitekamp's work on the subject predates Nolen's research. It was first presented in a dissertation at Cornell University, and is forthcoming as \\"The Right Stuff: The Wrong Sex: The Lovelace Women in Space Program\\" from Johns Hopkins University Press in 2004. It will be the authoritative work on this subject.<br />In addition, the story of the \\"Mercury 13,\\" as some call these women, is pretty well known in the spaceflight history community. In 1960, Dr. W. Randolph 'Randy' Lovelace II invited Geraldyn 'Jerrie' Cobb to undergo the physical fitness testing regimen that he had helped to develop to select the original U.S. astronauts, the Mercury Seven. Jerrie Cobb became the first American woman to do so, and she proved every bit as successful in the tests as had John Glenn and the other Mercury astronauts. Thereafter, Lovelace and Jerrie Cobb began to recruit more women to take the tests, totally without NASA involvement. Jacqueline Cochran, the famous American aviatrix and an old friend of Lovelace, joined their recruiting effort and volunteered to pay the testing expenses.<br />By the end of the summer of 1961, twenty-five women had undergone the examinations at the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The women came to New Mexico alone or in pairs for four days of tests. All of the women were skilled airplane pilots with commercial ratings. Most of them were recruited through the Ninety-Nines, a women pilot's organization.<br />Of those tested, thirteen women did exceptionally well and became known as the \\"First Lady Astronaut Trainees\\" or \\"Mercury 13.\\" A few then agreed to undertake additional tests, and some believed that the further testing represented the first step allowing them to become astronauts, although there was never any intent of this on the part of NASA officials. Indeed, Mercury project managers were unaware of these tests.<br />When NASA officials learned about Lovelace's attempts for further tests from the Navy, which Lovelace had asked to undertake these tests at Pensacola, they told Navy flight surgeons that this was not a NASA project. The Navy then canceled the tests. Jerrie Cobb and Janey Hart (married to U.S. Senator Philip Hart of Michigan) then began a campaign in Washington, D.C. to have the testing program resumed. On the July 17-18, 1962, Representative Victor Anfuso chaired hearings of a special Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics about this subject. Jerrie Cobb and Janey Hart testified for the women. John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, and George Low testified for NASA that setting up a special program to train women astronauts would hamper the effort to reach the Moon by the end of the decade. This ended the hearing and no women entered the NASA astronaut corps.<br />When Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space in 1963, Clare Booth Luce published an article about the women in \\"Life\\" magazine criticizing NASA for not achieving this first. It included contemporary photos of all thirteen women. Of course, Sally Ride became the first American woman in space in 1983, and in 1995 Eileen Collins became the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle. At Collins' invitation, eight of these women attended her launch.<br />In hindsight, one may criticize NASA leaders for not expanding the astronaut corps to women but there is no documentation whatsoever to suggest that there was even a consideration of doing so at the time. Perhaps John Glenn said it best when he remarked in recent years that the agency was reflective of its times. It is important to note, I think, that the first astronauts selected after the completion of Project Apollo--the class of 1978--did include women and other minorities, and therefore reflected the social changes experienced in the nation as a result of the women's movement.whatsoever to suggest that there was even a consideration of doing so at the time.

Nelson, then the chair of the House Space Science and Applications Subcommittee, was a payload specialist on mission STS-61C. This book relates his training regimen and preparation for the flight as well as the first-person account of the mission. At every level, &quot;Mission&quot; has an &quot;I was there&quot; quality about it, and is entertaining and insightful in that capacity. Most interesting, the last part of the book analyzes the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident and examines U.S. space policy. While costly, Nelson concludes, the risks are worth what will come out of the endeavor. He concludes his final chapter with these comments: &quot;If America ever abandoned her space ventures, then we would die as a nation, becoming second-rate in our own eyes, as well as in the eyes of the world....Our prime reason for commitment can be summed up...space is our next frontier&quot; (p. 296).

When Galileo first broadcast his findings about the solar system in 1610, he sparked a flood of speculation about lunar flight. Johann Kepler, himself a pathbreaking astronomer, posthumously published a novel, &quot;Somnium&quot; (Dream) (1634), that recounted a dream of a supernatural voyage to the Moon in which the visitors encountered serpentine creatures. He also included much scientific information in the book, speculating on the difficulties of overcoming the Earth's gravitational field, the nature of the elliptical paths of planets, the problems of maintaining life in the vacuum of space, and the geographical features of the Moon. It is an interesting and useful and perhaps the first entry in the genre of science fiction.	2004-01-07

Moreover, it is not simply a technical history but covers the decision-making process that lay behind the technological development, making it not just a history of hardware development but also an analysis of technical management and organization. As one reviewer said in &quot;Air University Review&quot; while reviewing the original edition of this book: &quot;This volume is just one of many excellent histories produced by government and contract historians for the NASA History Office....The book is enhanced by many excellent appendixes and charts, and it has a thorough essay on sources and documentation....Author Roger Bilstein...gracefully wends his way through a maze of technical documentation to reveal the important themes of his story; rarely has such a nuts-and-bolts tale been so gracefully told.&quot; I can only add my &quot;amen&quot; to that assessment.	2004-01-07

This is a lively journalistic account of the career of Harrison Storms, president of the Aerospace Division of North American Aviation that built the Apollo capsule. Because of the Apollo 1 fire that killed three astronauts in January 1967, Storms and North American Aviation, Inc., got sucked into a controversy over accountability and responsibility. In the aftermath Storms was removed from responsibility for the project. The most important aspect of this book is its discussion of the Apollo fire and responsibility for it from the perspective of industry. It lays the blame at NASA's feet and argues that Storms and North American were mere scapegoats. It, unfortunately, has no notes and the observations offered in it cannot be verified.

The best known work in this genre is Walter McDougall's Pulitizer Prize-winning volume, &quot;...the Heavens and the Earth.&quot; While McDougall's work was written in the early 1980s (published in 1985), still inside the framework of the Cold War, &quot;Single Stage to Orbit&quot; is able to take a more wholistic approach allowed by the passage of more time. That is also partly because Butrica's subject focuses on a single type of space hardware after its demise. His analysis clearly extends and to some extent revises McDougall's conclusions about the nature of technocracy in modern American society.<br />Butrica does a brilliant job explicating how the American political right gained hold of the ideology of progress in the last two decades of the twentieth century. His goal is to place the history of the Strategic Defense Initiative Office/&quot;single stage to orbit&quot; spaceplane effort in the context of the United States' well-documented political &quot;right turn&quot; of the past two-plus decades. He is very successful in examining the foundation and growth of the &quot;conservative space agenda&quot; and its linkage to various space advocacy groups. He also shows how conservative space advocates were able to manipulate the political system to achieve funding for their technological goal, a &quot;Single Stage to Orbit (SSTO)&quot; reusable launch vehicle.<br />Butrica's book is the only book-length history of SSTO technologies other than memoirs of participants, and hence it addresses an important original topic. What makes the book worthy of serious and sustained attention, however, is its explicit examination of the &quot;politics of space&quot; and its linkage of space politics to a specific set of technologies and management practices. The conservative space agenda he reveals in this book has not yet been the subject of historical analysis, and this is the book's primary contribution to the space history literature.<br />In itself, there is nothing overwhelmingly compelling about the story of SSTO. It was an effort begun in the 1980s, emphasized by Reaganite technological afficianadoes, to create a new space access capability through the development of a new space launcher. SSTO had long been the &quot;holy grail&quot; of spaceflight, the creation of a vehicle that could take off like an airplane, accelerate to hypersonic speeds, reach orbital velocity and enter orbit, and then return from space and land like an airplane on a runway. This is a very complex flight regime and one that has been impossible to achieve up to this time. Most engineers have thought it unachievable, and appropriately so, but it remained an enticing goal.<br />During the Reagan administration, some enthusiasts argued that technological stretch could make possible the &quot;single stage to orbit&quot; goal, and they achieved approval for a succession of SSTO programs. The tensions of the story are those of domestic politics and of engineers associated with industry versus those with government. The story plays out over several design projects from the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) through the DC-X to the X-33 of the 1990s.

It originated during the early 1960s when astronomers realized that once every 176 years both the Earth and all the giant planets of the Solar System gather on one side of the Sun. This geometric line-up made possible close up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto) in a single flight, the \\"Grand Tour.\\" The flyby of each planet would bend the spacecraft's flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. This would occur through a complicated process known as \\"gravity assist,\\" something like a slingshot effect, whereby the flight time to Neptune could be reduced from 30 to 12 years. NASA launched these missions from Cape Canaveral, Florida: Voyager 2 lifting off on August 20, 1977, with Voyager 1 entered space on a faster, shorter trajectory on September 5, 1977. These spacecraft would take a spectacular windshield tour of the outer Solar System gas giant planets.<br />The scientific results of the Voyager mission were astounding, essentially rewriting the textbooks on the Solar System. Over a period of more than a decade the probes explored all the giant outer planets, 48 of their moons, and the unique systems of rings and magnetic fields that those planets possess. The two spacecraft returned to Earth information that revolutionized the science of planetary astronomy, helping to resolve some key questions while raising intriguing new ones about the origin and evolution of the planets in this Solar System. The two Voyagers took well over 100,000 images of the outer planets, rings, and satellites, as well as millions of magnetic, chemical spectra, and radiation measurements. They discovered rings around Jupiter, volcanoes on Io, ice on Europa, shepherding satellites in Saturn's rings, new moons around Uranus and Neptune, and geysers on Triton. The last imaging sequence was Voyager 1's portrait of most of the Solar System, showing Earth and six other planets as sparks in a dark sky lit by a single bright star, the Sun.<br />Perhaps a personal anecdote is in order here. When Voyager reached Jupiter in 1979 I was a starving graduate student working on a Ph.D. in the history of the American West. Like everyone, I saw the images that came back to Earth and was truly impressed. When I filed my income tax form the next year I included a little note, which I'm sure made the clerk at the IRS chuckle, that stated that I wanted all of my tax money paid that year to go to NASA because of what it had accomplished with Voyager. Perhaps it was silly gesture but it points up the impressive nature of the scientific return.<br />This book makes clear that Voyager was an early step in humanity's exploratory journey extending not only to the outer planets but also beyond the Solar System. It is a scintillating portrait of a critical program and a must read for all interested in the history of space exploration.<br />Highly recommended!0 images of the outer planets, rings, and satellites, as well as millions of magnetic, chemical spectra, and radiation measurements.

The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was established in 1915 in response to the rapid advancement in aeronautical technology in Europe and the need in the United States to duplicate and surpass that level of effort. The NACA was transformed into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1958 in the aftermath of the Sputnik crisis, and given a mandate to undertake R&amp;D in space technology in addition to its aeronautics component. As a synthesis this work brings together what is known about the history of these organizations. It does not seek to advance basic knowledge but instead to ensure that what is presently known is captured in a single volume. In successfully doing so, Bilstein's work will become the standard work on the subject.<br />Roger Bilstein is one of the very best historians of air and space technology working today. He also has the ability to prepare exceptionally comprehensive, uniquely useful syntheses. His books--&quot;Flight in America: From the Wrights to the Astronauts&quot; (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1984, and several subsequent editions) and &quot;The American Aerospace Industry: From Workshop to Global Enterprise&quot; (Twayne Publishers, 1996)--are also standard introductory works on their subjects. Both books are the place to start with in any investigation of air and space activities. It is not easy to write satisfactory syntheses and Bilstein has a knack for it, as do no others working in aerospace historians. He demonstrates it well here.<br />\\"Testing Aircraft/Exploring Space\\" is the latest synthesis from Bilstein, and it bears all of the outstanding qualities of his earlier efforts mentioned above. He ranges broadly across his subject, exploring the history of the NACA and NASA since 1915. It is not an institutional history, however, emphasizing the research and development activities of these federal organizations rather the bureaucracy and the minutia of politics.<br />It is a terrific overview of a complex and important subject appearing at the time of the celebration of a century of flight since the Wright brothers.r, emphasizing the research and development activities of these federal organizations rather the bureaucracy and the minutia of politics.<br />It is a terrific overview of a complex and important subject appearing at the time of the celebration of a century of flight since the Wright brothers.	2004-01-06

This is quite an interesting book, and one that all interested in the the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should read. I give it 5 stars not because I believe everything in it, but because I believe its claims should be seriously considered.<br />After the LDS church's exodus from Missouri in the winter of 1838-1839 the always opportunistic John Cook Bennett (1804-1867) saw a chance to get ahead by helping the Mormons who were coming as refugees into Illinois. In 1840 he moved to the Mormon stronghold at Nauvoo and ingratiated himself with Joseph Smith, who was impressed with his persona and powerful connections in the state. Bennett demonstrated his considerable organizational ability and leadership talent on behalf of the Mormons in the fall of 1840 by spearheading the effort to guide the Nauvoo City Charter through the State Legislature. He then helped to organize the Nauvoo Legion and secured for it arms from the state arsenal. After these successes, Joseph Smith was even more impressed with the sophisticated physician/politician/businessman/army officer, and he rewarded him with great power and influence in Nauvoo, something that Bennett apparently craved more than anything else. Smith made Bennett a major general in the Nauvoo Legion and helped him win the election as mayor of the city early in 1841. Soon afterward Stephen A. Douglas appointed him Master in Chancery for Hancock County. No one else in Nauvoo had risen so quickly.<br />But Bennett's fall was just as rapid. He and Smith soon quarreled over a variety of issues. They became rivals on several levels--church business, city issues, political activities, and especially the sexual escapade of Mormon polygamy--and the clashes soon became overburdening. By May 1842 a public break had taken place, both Bennett and Smith charging each other with all types of crimes. There can be no doubt that sexual politics played the key role, as both accused the other of indiscretions. Smith's powerful position as the church's prophet ensured that he won the battle for the allegiance of the citizens of Nauvoo, however, and Bennett fled the town. He then set about to expose Smith in speeches across the state and in letters to Illinois newspapers.<br />Bennett, of course, knew about Joseph Smith's most volatile theological innovation, the concept of plural marriage. Gossip about the practice had swirled about Mormonism since the mid-1830s--an 1835 General Conference had even adopted a resolution explicitly denying the charge--but the practice emerged full-blown in Nauvoo during the early 1840s. By the time of Bennett's disaffection, Smith had married no fewer than eight women and because of his close association with Smith, Bennett knew about some of these liaisons. Bennett brought this most explosive of all issues to public attention in 1842, and this book is a key part of that campaign.<br />Bennett was especially aware of the marriage of Joseph Smith to Louisa Beaman on April 5, 1841, and discusses it in this 1842 book-length expose of the church. Smith wanted desperately to keep plural marriage a secret, however, and took steps to ensure that no one would violate the confidence. If he was not sure of a person's loyalty, and therefore silence, the prophet apparently attempted either to coerce or to destroy credibility. Bennett, whose reputation was not exactly clean on this score anyway, became the target of a smear campaign in Nauvoo. He was charged with everything from rape to attempted murder, and his character has ever after been sullied. While there is certainly some truth to the charges made by Joseph Smith against John Bennett in 1842, some of them were mere fabrications. He became a scapegoat for secret polygamy--seduction, deception, and hypocrisy.<br />Even though some were probably untrue, in this book Bennett countered with his own set of charges against Joseph Smith. Many of his depictions in this book on the evolution of Mormon theocracy, temple endowments, and plural marriage, however, proved to have been pretty much on the mark. Within days of leaving Nauvoo Bennett launched into an expose of Mormonism on the lecture circuit and in newspapers and magazines. His series of four letters to an Illinois newspaper, the \\"Sangamo Journal,\\" became the basis for this book. The core of it is a discussion of plural marriage, or \\"spiritual wifery,\\" and the frank discussions scandalized non-Mormon readers and convinced many that Smith was involved in secret sexual activity with various women.<br />In it Bennett boldly named people who could attest to the truth of his assertions, and he included some documents, including a letter Smith sent to Nancy Rigdon, urging her to put aside her objections and engage in polygamous relations with him. The prophet flatly denied any wrongdoing, however, and most Mormons believed him.<br />It is important after more than a century and a half to reassess Bennett's charges in this book and to ascertain for oneself their legitimacy. For example, corroboration for some of Bennett's expose came from Sarah Pratt, the wife of Mormon apostle Orson Pratt, who is on record as having to rebuff Joseph Smith in 1842 when he asked her to become his \\"spiritual wife\\" while her husband was on a mission to England and Scotland. This incident, of course, presents a very difficult historical problem for any belief that Mormon plural marriage was ordained of God since it violates the dictum of a woman having \\"but one husband.\\"<br />I believe there is more to the Bennett expose than most have been willing to acknowledge in the past. Bennett was an opportunitist and a scoundrel, but I think he also reports truthfully on a lot of what was taking place in Nauvoo in the 1840s. Bennett was castigated as the \\"fiendish\\" originator of weird sexual practices with women rather than Smith, who certainly originated polygamy. Bennett was, in fact, made the scapegoat for activities that the Nauvoo Mormons did not want to acknowledge in Smith or in the Mormon community generally.<br />Read this book with a critical mind, check its charges against other accounts, and decide for yourself.

Ever since she published \\"No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet\\" in 1945, calling into serious question most of the faith claims based on Mormonism's early history, an enormous amount of energy has been expended by Mormon historians, apologists, and critics of all backgrounds and persuasions either to defend or to deny her conclusions. The themes explored by Mormon historians since that time have often responded to Brodie's analysis.<br /><br />When Brodie published \\"No Man Knows My History\\" in 1945, she analyzed Mormonism's founder using the standards of secular scholarship. She interpreted him as a charlatan at first motivated by self-serving desires but gradually coming to believe in his own prophetic mission. She also acknowledged his very real accomplishments in forming an important religious movement in the United States. In many ways it was a seminal study that served as a transition point between what has been inaccurately called the old and the new Mormon history, the \\"old\\" generally viewed as polemical while the \\"new\\" was considered less concerned with questions of religious truth and more interested in understanding why events unfolded as they did. It is a measure of the success of her biography of Smith that it is still considered more than fifty years later the standard work on the subject and the starting point for all analyses of Mormonism. A second edition of this book, published in 1971, revised some of her earlier conclusions, especially her contention that Smith had been a charlatan, and incorporated recent trends from psychohistory to explain him more as a self-deluded imposter.<br /><br />Brodie, perhaps intentionally, dealt a damaging blow to many of the Mormon foundational beliefs when she questioned most of the basic assumptions about Mormon origins in her biography of Joseph Smith. In \\"No Man Knows My History\\" she systematically dealt with five basic issues that have challenged Mormon historians ever since. One of the most important was Joseph Smith's \\"First Vision,\\" for which she emphatically denied that there was any valid evidence until Smith fabricated it in 1838 when he began dictating his history to provide a starting point for his prophetic career that would counter charges that he was involved in treasure seeking. A second was the whole issue of treasure seeking itself and its relationship both to Smith and Mormon origins. Third, Brodie questioned the origins and content of the Book of Mormon, asserting that it was a product of Joseph Smith's vivid imagination and not an actual history of any group of people who came to America. Fourth, she explored in depth the origins of plural marriage and the duplicity Smith registered in originating it to justify what she thought was his licentious nature. Finally, Brodie interpreted Smith as a would-be tyrant seeking to take over some or all of the territory of the United States to create his own theocratic state with himself in charge.<br /><br />She provides an in depth analysis of each of these themes in her biography of Smith, and those perspectives still hold a powerful sway over Mormon historiography. One cannot begin to understand the development of the Mormon religion without grappling with the issues raised by Fawn Brodie.asic issues that have challenged Mormon historians ever since.

Third, Brodie questioned the origins and content of the Book of Mormon, asserting that it was a product of Joseph Smith's vivid imagination and not an actual history of any group of people who came to America. Fourth, she explored in depth the origins of plural marriage and the duplicity Smith registered in originating it to justify what she thought was his licentious nature. Finally, Brodie interpreted Smith as a would-be tyrant seeking to take over some or all of the territory of the United States to create his own theocratic state with himself in charge.    She provides an in depth analysis of each of these themes in her biography of Smith, and those perspectives still hold a powerful sway over Mormon historiography. One cannot begin to understand the development of the Mormon religion without grappling with the issues raised by Fawn Brodie.	2003-12-21

Both authors are fine scholars and bring a wealth of understanding to the subject. In the process they explore the legal history of the often rocky relationships between Mormons and other Americans. They also offer a discussion of internal Mormon legal actions such as ecclesiastical courts and during the pioneer Utah period, adjudication of water rights in the arid territory.<br />But Edwin Brown Firmage and Richard Collin Mangrum fall sway to the Mormon myth of &quot;persecuted innocence.&quot; Indeed, the authors of &quot;Zion in the Courts&quot; fail to move beyond the interpretive framework prearranged to lean in a pro-Latter-day Saint direction. While there may be some room for permutations of interpretation, Latter-day Saint leaders have essentially drawn a line in the sand about what may and may not be considered as an interpretive framework and most historians have accepted it (or perhaps have never even considered going beyond it) because of their religious convictions. Those who have ventured too far, notably D. Michael Quinn and Lavina Fielding Anderson, have been excommunicated from the church.<br />As a result the authors of &quot;Zion in the Courts,&quot; despite the book's other very real qualities, assume without any serious discussion the viability and justification of a Mormon theocracy, i.e., Zion. The authors assert that the zionic goal inevitably led to persecution endured by an innocent church through both legal and extralegal means. They wrote that &quot;The story of the persecution Mormons suffered through the institutions of the legal system, and of their efforts to establish their own legal system--one appropriate to Zion... illustrates democracy's potential to oppress an insular, minority community;...&quot; (p. xiv-xv).<br />The authors apparently believe that theocracy is both possible and desirable, but such a quest for empire mandates by this perspective would always run against the grain of the American mainstream, and legal institutions by definition would oppose it. Far from democracy's &quot;oppression&quot; of a minority, I would suggest, the nation's legal system would assert itself to defend the cherished principles of the Constitution against a perceived threat to liberty from a theocracy bent on taking control. Debate over whether or not liberty was really threatened by Mormon theocracy is moot, but undoubtedly non-Mormons considered the church's secular power a threat to the Constitution. The authors fail to appreciate the inherent tension between democracy and theocracy. They also seem not to appreciate that there might be other equally valid approaches toward Mormonism's zionic quest. For some it represented a spiritual condition where righteousness and justness were partners with goodwill and charity, a position that eschewed the secular, theocratic aspects that always created ill-will between Mormons and other Americans. Unfortunately, the authors of &quot;Zion in the Courts&quot; did not consider criticisms of Mormonism's quest for empire-- criticisms that were coherent, internally consistent, and deserving of serious consideration. They accept at face value the Mormon dialectic. As a result, &quot;Zion in the Courts&quot; represents both the worst and the best of the recent writing on the Mormon past.and desirable, but such a quest for empire mandates by this perspective would always run against the grain of the American mainstream, and legal institutions by definition would oppose it.

The figure of Dwight D. Eisenhower has dominated this recent work, and does so in this important book by Robert A. Divine, and Ike has accordingly emerged as a much more effective leader than thought at the time. Rather than a smiling, do-nothing, golf-playing president, Eisenhower's leadership in handling the Soviet Union in space now increasingly appears far-sighted and rational. To ensure against Soviet aggression, Eisenhower supported the development of ICBM deterrent capabilities and reconnaissance satellites as a means of learning about potentially aggressive actions.<br />Most important, Eisenhower established the right of international overflight with satellites, making possible the free use of reconnaissance spacecraft in future years. From the perspective of the Eisenhower administration, which was committed to development of an orbital reconnaissance capability as a national defense initiative, an international agreement to ban satellites from overflying national borders without the individual nation's permission was unacceptable. Eisenhower was concerned that if the United States was the first nation to orbit a satellite, the Soviet Union could invoke territorial rights in space. Soviet Sputniks 1 and 2, however, overflew international boundaries without provoking a single diplomatic protest.<br />As Divine shows in this book, on October 8, 1957, Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Quarles told the president: &quot;the Russians have...done us a good turn, unintentionally, in establishing the concept of freedom of international space.&quot; Eisenhower immediately grasped this as a means of pressing ahead with the launching of a reconnaissance satellite. The precedent held for Explorer 1 and Vanguard 1, and by the end of 1958 the tenuous principle of &quot;freedom of space&quot; had been established. By allowing the Soviet Union to lead in this area, the Russian space program had established the U.S.-backed precedent for free access.<br />Of course, as Divine demonstrates, Eisenhower displayed a tin ear when asked to listen to the American public in the aftermath of the Sputnik launches in October and November 1957. Eisenhower triefd to reassure U.S. citizens that efforts in space were on track but he was insufficiently successful. He was berated in the media and on the stump for this failure at the time, and there are some appropriate reasons to question his administration's ability to react to public unrest.<br />At the same time, Ike's leadership in the crisis winter of 1957-1958 yielded some of the most sweeping governmental reorganizations and new programs to be undertaken at the federal level since the New Deal. Divine suggests that overall, Ike made several important changes to react to the Sputnik crisis, taking these decisive actions:<br />1. Established a Science Advisor, and the President's Science Advisory Committee,  to coordinate basic research in the Federal government.<br />2. Approved additional space research activities.<br />3. Backed up IGY satellite program with Explorer 1, launched January 31, 1958, \\"to make sure we fire a satellite at an early date.&quot;<br />4. Established the Advanced Research Projects Agency within the Department of Defense.<br />5. Sponsored the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, creating a single Federal organization--NASA--to manage space exploration activities.<br />6. Sponsored the National Defense Education Act of 1958 to stimulate the education, training, and research for science and technology.<br />These efforts have now been effectively analyzed in Robert Divine's, &quot;The Sputnik Challenge.&quot; Most people only remember NASA's creation from this period, but the response was much more sweeping and significant.ed.

Actually, spaceflight seems to be generally popular with Americans, but not a high priority for most. Commitment to it, therefore, is widespread but not deep.<br />This book seeks to understand and explain the relationship of space exploration to the larger popular culture. It is one of several recent works to do so in a serious way in recent years, and clearly the most important of all of them. \\"Space and the American Imagination\\" presents a significant analysis of the interplay between popular culture and public policy. Howard McCurdy concludes that how closely the dominant trends in science fiction literature and film, as well as public perceptions, reinforce actual events in spaceflight fundamentally affects public support for spaceflight.<br />McCurdy notes that during the 1950s and 1960s the relationship between reality and perceptions drew tightly together and created an expectation that allowed the accomplishment of the lunar landings. Since that era, the paths of public perceptions and actual events has diverged. A challenging interpretation that requires skepticism but also continued consideration, McCurdy has demarked an important area of consideration that will keep scholars working for years testing his hypotheses.<br />This is a highly recommended book!	2003-12-21

It received Pulitzer Prize and a host of other well-deserved awards with its analysis of the origins and conduct of the space race. This book explores the Cold War rivalry in race with the preparations for and launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, through the race to the Moon in the 1960s. The author argues that the mandate to complete Apollo on Kennedy's schedule prompted the space program to become identified almost exclusively with high-profile, expensive, human spaceflight projects. This was because Apollo became a race against the Soviet Union for recognition as the world leader in science and technology and by extension in other fields as well.<br />McDougall juxtaposes the American effort of Apollo with the Soviet space program and the dreams of such designers as Sergei P. Korolev to land a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. The author recognizes Apollo as a significant engineering achievement but concludes that it was also enormously costly both in terms of resources and the direction to be taken in state support of science and technology. In the end, NASA had to stress engineering over science, competition over cooperation, civilian over military management, and international prestige over practical applications. Not all agree with McDougall's arguments, but since the publication of &quot;the Heavens and the Earth...&quot; historians have been striving to equal its scintillating analysis, stellar writing, and scope of discussion.	2003-12-20

For nearly four centuries a technologically superior European civilization constantly pressed the native population either to conform to a new hegemony or to withdraw from it, conquering the various first peoples and destroying their population in the process. By the close of the nineteenth century the native population had dwindled, ravaged by war and disease and starvation, to the extent that some began to characterize it as a \\"vanishing race.\\" In 1900 the Native American population in the United States reached a nadir at 237,196, a seven-fold decline from what it had been estimated in 1492.<br />In &quot;American Indian Population Recovery in the Twentieth Century&quot; Nancy Shoemaker of the University of Connecticut, Storrs, analyzes what can only be viewed as a remarkable population recovery for Native Americans in the past century. With a population now approaching two million, Native Americans have political, economic, and social power as never before. This demographic study provides an important portrait of native peoples rising in number, wealth, and influence. The author finds that this population rebound has been quite emotionally empowering for Native Americans, as they take pride in having emerged from centuries of oppression.<br />This is a well down work that provides important insights into the demography of the first peoples of the United States.	2003-12-20

But it is also the story of how a creature of compromise designed by various political entities in Washington each with their own priorities and prerogatives, came to fruition. The story of developing this unique vehicle is ably told in Heppenheimer's book and should be a topic of both considerable significance and public interest in the post-&quot;Columbia&quot; accident era as this nation's political leaders make decisions about how to proceed--or perhaps not to proceed--with human spaceflight in the twenty-first century.<br />Heppenheimer does not argue an overarching thesis in this work; instead he provides a very helpful synthesis of the development of the shuttle. As such, this book should appeal to a general rather than a strictly engineering audience. Specifically, this work is akin to earlier works on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo and as such should become something of a basic reference in the history of American space flight efforts.<br />I should also say something about the nature of the historiography concerning the Space Shuttle, and the place of this book in it. There are no satisfactory general histories of the Space Shuttle program. By far, the best work to appear on the technical history of the Space Shuttle is by Dennis R. Jenkins. But that is a narrowly technical history that pays virtually no attention to the political, economic, and managerial aspects of the development effort. It also does not pretend to be a history in the sense that Jenkins uses primary documents and seeks to draw connections to larger issues. It is also, in essence, another large format illustrated history, but its illustrations are technical drawings.<br />As a result, Heppenheimer's Space Shuttle developmental history fills a major void in the historical literature, just as his book, &quot;The Space Shuttle Decision,&quot; did upon its publication.uot; did upon its publication.	2003-12-20

Burrows brings to the task of writing a comprehensive history of spaceflight a wealth of background and understanding. He added to that in-depth research and lucid writing to place between two covers the most exhaustive and complex history of the subject ever published. At some level, perhaps, he tries to do too much, but overall he succeeds admirably in explaining the political, technical, scientific, economic, and cultural history of humanity's recent adventure in space. It is a long read, and sometimes requires effort on the part of the reader to wade through exceptionally complex scenes, but &quot;The New Ocean&quot; is overall a stunning achievement. The chances are pretty good that readers will be able to answer almost any question they might have about spaceflight by referring to this book. And if they cannot find everything they want on the subject, the exhaustive bibliographical references point to additional material. I recommend this as a starting point for serious exploration of the history of spaceflight worldwide.	2003-12-20

Douglas Brinkley offers a court history of breadth and scope, relying on the rarely accessible Ford Motor Company archives to flesh out stories of the birth of the assembly line, the Model T, union busting in the 1930s, anti-Semitism, and successes with the Mustang, LTD, and Taurus.<br />Throughout &quot;Wheels for the World&quot; Henry Ford is the force that creates and holds a corporate empire together. Brinkley devotes the first two-thirds of the book to him, exploring the paradoxes in his psyche: a self-taught engineer who created a corporate empire, a high minded entrepreneur in the mold of Robert Owen at one time and an anti-union zealot at another, and a man who used his wealth and power to spout ill-informed and sometimes demagogic ideas. Brinkley's final assessment is well-reasoned and enigmatic.	2003-12-20

Here are my reasons for recommending the work.<br />First, there has not been any genuine attempt to write a comprehensive overview of the history of air power since Robin Higham published his book, \\"Air Power: A Concise History\\" in 1972. This work, of course, is an expansion and updating of that earlier book. I believe it fulfills a real need in the historical literature because of its broad perspective, sweeping conclusions, and multinational character. Higham is at his best in synthesizing the interrelationships of air power from nation to nation and conflict to conflict. He is equally at home with American, European, and Asian aspects of the story.<br />Second, I believe that the author has effectively explored the evolution of the doctrine of air power and incorporated the seven major ingredients of air power into his discussion:<br />1. Strategic bombardment of enemy production facilities and marshalling yards (with both land- and sea-based aircraft and missiles). Strategic bombing took on enormous importance because it was the most spectacular mission an air component could accomplish without assistance from ground forces.<br />2. Aerial interdiction, a close relative to strategic bombardment, but not exactly the same, for its purpose is to stop the flow of enemy assets to the battlefield.<br />3. Air superiority, control of the airspace over the battlefield and the classic dogfighting of fighters.<br />4. Air interception, fighter defense of friendly territory.<br />5. Ground attack and close air support, aircraft used in direct support of ground forces for victory in a battle. This is the classic case of infantry calling in air strikes seen in many Hollywood war films. In reality, it is a very important and difficult skill to master, especially in hitting a target while missing the friendly troops nearby. Another component came into this after World War II with the rise of helicopters that have a special place in accomplishing this mission but are owned, at least in the U.S., by the Army rather than the Air Force.<br />6. Airlift, an especially important aspect of air power usually ignored or taken for granted.  It was the measure of victory in certain aspects of World War II (e.g. keeping China in the war through the Hump airlift and in airborne operations), in the Berlin Airlift, in the siege of Khe Sanh, in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and perhaps in the deployment for the Gulf War.<br />7. Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (CI) has been critical to the successful use of air power.  These include such things as reconnaissance, AWACs, DEW Line, navigation, radar, fire control, and the Global Positioning System.<br />Third, the author every effectively explores two themes--continuity and change--to give unity to the book and make the past useful for understanding recent events. Providing a suggestive description of air power in recent conflicts, Higham demonstrates how tactics and strategy sometimes paralleled those employed by air commanders of much earlier eras.<br />Fourth, the author's most interesting chapter is his last one, in which he offers some lessons for those involved in air power strategy and doctrine today. That suggestive chapter will find use in a variety of settings.<br />This is a must read book, and I would go further to add that it should be re-read, annotated, and referred to repeatedly.II with the rise of helicopters that have a special place in accomplishing this mission but are owned, at least in the U.S., by the Army rather than the Air Force.<br />6.

Tom Stafford is one of America's most significant astronauts, although he is less well known than some of the others. While Stafford's four spaceflights--Gemini VI, Gemini IX, Apollo 10, and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP)--made critical contributions to the development of American space capability in the pioneering era of the 1960s and 1970s, his efforts since the 1970s as the unofficial ambassador to the Soviet Union for space and his key roles in defining space policy in the United States have been even more critical to the evolution of human space flight. One senior NASA official has said, and I agree with the assessment, that Stafford's efforts have shaped every important policy issue affecting human spaceflight for the last quarter century. In these arenas of Stafford's career this book makes important contributions to understanding. Stafford, furthermore, has a credible and exceptionally capable space writer to assist him in putting this book together. Michael Cassutt is the author of many other books, including one with Deke Slayton. Both Stafford and Cassutt deserve credit for presenting a complex person and complex era clearly and concisely.<br />This book may also become a benchmark in the historiography of human spaceflight because of its insights into the American/Soviet relationship in space. There have been since the 1950s no two spaceflight programs that have been more closely tied than those of the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia, sometimes as rivals and at other instances as cooperative efforts. Stafford has played a key role in both the rivalry and the cooperation. This autobiography discusses the push and pull of these two programs and demonstrates that even as competition reigned in the 1970s a thawing was taking place that led eventually to the cooperative construction of the International Space Station (ISS) at the end of the twentieth century. Because of Stafford's close association with Soviet leaders and cosmonauts beginning in 1971, as well as during the ASTP program, in the early 1990s he was privy to many of the negotiations and served as a means of back channel communication between Russian and U.S. leaders that led to bringing Russia into the ISS program. That story cannot be adequately told without Stafford's account of what took place in the negotiations.<br />This book provides a valuable first-person account of significant aspects of human spaceflight since the 1970s. It has appeal not only to specialists as a record of a principal actor in the arena, but also to spaceflight enthusiasts who want intimate accounts by astronauts.ntieth century.

This set of &quot;National Laboratories&quot; had become so powerful by 1961 that President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his farewell address warned the American people not only about the &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; but also of the &quot;danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.&quot; These laboratories have been under the nominal authority of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and later the Department of Energy (DoE). They included several entities associated with the Manhattan Project of World War II--Argonne, Berkeley, Brookhaven, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge--as well as later additions, such as the Lawrence Livermore installation. Together, these facilities undertook extensive strategic weapons research and development during a forty-year cold war.<br />This collection of laboratories, manufacturing plants, test sites, and think tanks possess complex origins and evolution and have attracted sustained historical inquiry. &quot;The National Labs&quot; is a fine addition to this extensive and sophisticated literature. It works best as a synthesis of previous arguments about the role of these weapons labs in recent American history and as a vehicle for understanding the relationship between American science and the modern federal establishment.<br />Author Peter J. Westwick coins a new term, &quot;systemicity,&quot; as a unifying theme in this study, in the process emphasizing his contention that these facilities may only be understood as a diverse collection unified by a common goal and head but with significant centrifugal tendencies. For Westwick &quot;systemicity&quot; involves a changing set of alliances and rivalries central to the evolution of these weapons labs, negotiations abounding among those representing the various facilities and divergent priorities. These labs jockeyed for position and specialized or diversified in various areas to ensure primacy within the system. Their competition ensured the honing of skills perhaps not possible otherwise.<br />No doubt, &quot;systemicity&quot; as Westwick defines it has long been present, although one could question the value of advocating new jargon for what may be viewed as an obvious set of interactions.

Douglas Hurt makes the case that Boone's youngest son, Nathan, deserves a place there as well. Born in Kentucky in 1781, Nathan Boone learned the skills of the hunter and woodsman from his father and developed both an affinity and an aptitude for the environment very early. He continued his father's wanderlust by moving westward to Missouri as a young man and remaining on the outposts of the United States throughout his life. In so doing, he earned a livelihood as a hunter, trapper, guide, surveyor, and military officer.<br />The central feature of Nathan Boone's life, and the core of this biography, was his military service. During the War of 1812 he led a company of rangers on campaigns in the Old Northwest. In 1832, at the age of 51, he organized his own company of Missouri Rangers for the Black Hawk War. This time, at the end of the conflict Nathan Boone transferred to the regular army's dragoons at Fort Leavenworth. He remained on active duty from 1833 until forced to take a final leave of absence in 1848. He maintained his commission, even if not on active duty, until 1853 when health finally prompted his resignation. Serving under Stephen Watts Kearny on the Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma frontier suited Boone just fine. He also acquitted himself well as a captain in the dragoons and was called upon to lead several expeditions during his active service to patrol the region. He did not, however, accompany Kearny's Army of the West in its invasion of New Mexico and California in 1846, remaining behind on garrison duty in Oklahoma.<br />This is a straightforward and competent biography. Capably researched and written, it rescues from nearly complete obscurity a figure of moderate significance in the American West in the mid-nineteenth century. Proceeding chronologically, it also excels at describing the role of the army on the frontier in those periods when war was not taking place. As such it is a welcome addition to the historical literature. It is also a worthwhile addition to the &quot;Missouri Biography Series&quot; in which it appears.xcels at describing the role of the army on the frontier in those periods when war was not taking place.

The author and publisher should be commended for making this revision available in an inexpensive paperback edition.<br />In this work Steven Riess, on the faculty of Northwestern University, explores the history of baseball--truly the national pastime in this era--as it became in the first part of the twentieth century the preeminent sporting activity in the United States. He notes that there are many myths about this sport that have informed our perspective on the rise of the sport, and seeks to explore how these arose and explodes or revises many of them.<br />Beginning with an excellent historiographical essay on the study of baseball history, much updated since the 1983 edition, Riess places the sport's history in the larger context of cultural studies in the United States and charts a course for its study as a significant factor during the Progressive era. He then moves on to explore the unique relationship between baseball and the fan, and the sport's relationship to deeply felt societal needs within the United States.<br />Thereafter Riess considers the relationships between professional baseball and urban politicos and the larger communities that they were a part of. This discussion revolves around several of the key questions that arose in the Progressive era. These include the siting and construction of baseball parks and the role of the public/private partnership in bringing them to fruition; the propriety of playing baseball games on Sundays and the repeal of \\"Blue Laws\\"; and the manner in which the game was promoted to the public by both the owners and the leaders of the larger community.<br />In each case, Riess focuses on examples drawn from Atlanta, New York, and Chicago. Certainly New York and Chicago are the two most significant major league cities of the era, although it would have been interesting to have seen more examples from places like Boston, St. Louis, and Philadelphia, each of which had two teams. Atlanta has an important place in this study because of its central role in minor league baseball with the legendary \\"Crackers.\\" Again, additional experiences drawn from other stellar minor league cities of the Progressive era, such as those in the Pacific Coast League, would have broadened the study.<br />These are minor objections to be sure; this study is one of the most important ever to appear in sports history. It is a must read for anyone who seeks to understand the history of baseball and its relationship to larger American society. As such, it has taken an enormous stride beyond the usual historical treatments of baseball with their emphasis on exploits on the field and heroes of the diamond to ask and seek to answer fundamental questions about America culture and its development in the twentieth century.e era, although it would have been interesting to have seen more examples from places like Boston, St. Louis, and Philadelphia, each of which had two teams.

It begins with a discussion of the origins of the goal of winged spaceflight in the 1920s, extends through the Dyna Soar, lifting body, and X-plane research until the decision to proceed with the Space Shuttle in 1972. It then goes into great detail about the shuttle's design and development effort in the 1970s and then discusses in some detail the first 100 missions of the program since 1981. In every case Jenkins offers an excellent technical analysis of all aspects of the vehicle. This book is the place to start in any effort to understand the history of the Space Shuttle. When the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) started investigating the shuttle accident of February 1, 2003, its members read this book as background to their important work. Jenkins soon became a staff member supporting the CAIB and his expertise showed in the final report.	2003-12-17

Not only were the practical details of daily life transformed by the application of scientific discoveries, but our very sense of self, how our minds work, how our world came to be, how it works and our proper role in it, our ultimate origins, and our ultimate fate were all influenced by scientific thinking as never before in human history. And both good and ill has resulted from this new relationship. It has brought both cures for deadly diseases and weapons of mass destruction. The awesome and awful nature of science and technology in the century just past is the subject of this once- over-lightly book.<br />While no field of study is handled in a completely satisfying manner, this book is adequate as a broad overview. Unfortunately, and this is largely because the subject is so large and complex, Piel cannot supply more than a cursory overview of any individual topic. Many subjects deserving of attention are given short shrift, including spaceflight.	2003-11-19

A silvery disk hanging in the night sky, it conjures up images of romance and magic. It has been counted upon to foreshadow important events, both of good and ill, and its phases for eons served humanity as its most accurate measure of time. With the invention of the telescope at the turn of the seventeenth century-coinciding with the rise of the scientific revolution-the Moon took on new meaning as a tangible place with mountains and valleys and craters that could be named and geological features and events that could be studied.<br />Geologist Scott L. Montgomery has produced a richly detailed analysis of how the Moon has been visualized in Western culture through the ages, revealing the faces it has presented to philosophers, writers, artists, and scientists for nearly three millennia. To do this, he has drawn on a wide array of sources that illustrate the changing concept of nature and the significance of heavenly bodies from classical antiquity to the dawn of modern science.<br />Montgomery especially focuses on the seventeenth century, when the Moon was first mapped and its features named. He explores in depth the literary works of Francis Godwin's &quot;Man in the Moone&quot; and Cyrano de Bergerac's &quot;L'autre monde.&quot; But he also carries the story to the present, showing how humanity has over time elevated the Moon to a sublime level.<br />As Montgomery concluded, humans have always assigned a close approximation of the Earth to lunar ideas. When we ultimately colonize the Moon the irony is that we will be setting up shop on a world steeped in a deep human tradition of imagination and history. This is a superb work that explains far more effectively than other works on the subject, the lure of the Moon for humanity.	2003-11-19

That fact makes it significant. The fact that the mission was an unqualified success-when a success for NASA was truly critical in the aftermath of two successive failures with Mars probes in 1999-makes it rare. The fact that it was conducted by the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory over the protests of the mighty Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA's traditional solar system exploration center, makes it politically sensitive. The fact that the NEAR team performed the mission on the cheap, spending less than $150 million, makes it unprecedented for deep space probes. The fact that it returned thousands of images, spectra, and other measurements about the large near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros makes it scientifically relevant.<br />After a long gestation period, NEAR began its voyage to Eros on 17 February 1996, the first mission flown under NASA's new Discovery program, a series of low-cost planetary science projects. NEAR finally moved into orbit around Eros on 14 February 2000, roughly a year later than intended.<br />Throughout 2000, NEAR explored Eros offering spectacular pictures and a rich harvest of spectroscopy data. At the conclusion of the mission, on 12 February 2001, the mission team landed it on the surface of Eros. Although the NEAR spacecraft was not designed to survive landing, its instruments remained operational until 1 March 2001.<br />In &quot;Asteroid Rendezvous&quot; several of the scientists and engineers who conducted the NEAR mission describe it in their own words from initial concept studies through development, launch, and cruise operations. The book is liberally illustrated throughout with both stunning images from the mission and explanatory diagrams.<br />&quot;Asteroid Rendezvous&quot; is long on description and celebration and short on analysis and critical examination. Even so, it is a very interesting book, and a fine start in documenting the history of this important mission.

Glen Leonard is a fine historian who has been working on this subject for more than twenty years. This should have been his magnum opus, instead it adds virtually nothing to understanding about the subject and in many areas is a significant step backward.<br />The fundamental problem is summarized in Glen Leonard's book title, &quot;Nauvoo: A Place of Peace, A People of Promise.&quot; Nauvoo may have been a beautiful place, as Joseph Smith Jr. thought, but it was never a place of peace. Political, economic, religious, cultural, and social divisions both within and without the church constantly swirled between 1839 and 1846. Some who have spent significant time in Nauvoo, including myself, would conclude that they still exist and rumble just below the surface of a seemingly quiet little town. In addition, there is abundant reason to question the \\"people of promise\\" aspect of Glen Leonard's title. Were they a \\"people\\" in a unified sense of the term? What promise did they hold?<br />What the title suggests is that this overview of the history of Nauvoo is a thoroughly faithful construct that seeks to show God working among the Mormons in every aspect of their lives. In essence, it represents a return to an overtly mythic history not seen since the time of Andrew Jensen and B. H. Roberts. Leonard asserts repeatedly that Nauvoo represented the first major explication of Joseph Smith's vision of the world. Nauvoo represented, and this is what he emphasizes to the exclusion of anything that might be contradictory, the first instance of Mormonism as a new religious tradition substantively different from what has gone before. It was in Nauvoo that Joseph Smith Jr. taught, admittedly to a small group sworn to secrecy, his most unique religious conceptions. In so doing, Leonard suggests, it was at Nauvoo that Joseph Smith Jr. fulfilled his religious mission. With such a perspective, mythic interpretations of the Mormon experience in western Illinois represent the only possibility for this book.<br />The reason for Leonard's myopic concern with Mormon theology is that the Latter-day Saints do not so much have a theology as they have a history. Confusing theology with history, therefore, requires that believing church members accept a specified set of affirmations that are grounded in the \\"pure\\" thoughts and actions of past individuals, especially those of Joseph Smith Jr. Without acceptance of these truths, Mormonism could and probably should fall of its own weight. The perception of truth or falsity about the religion, therefore, rests on what historians say about those who have gone before. Glen Leonard, therefore, is fulfilling the Mormon equivalent of St. Thomas Aquinas by systematizing the Nauvoo \\"truths\\" for the faithful.<br />Unfortunately, this expounding of his thesis leaves the reader wanting, or alternatively frustrated and angry, that the effort is not more sophisticated. In the end there is a wealth of detail in this lengthy book on the history of Nauvoo. It is not the historiographical triumph that I had hoped. Glen Leonard seems to attribute virtually all positive developments in both Nauvoo's history and the evolution of the church to inspired leadership by Joseph Smith Jr. or Brigham Young and to the righteousness of the rank and file. Any negative developments, and there were many, Leonard too often blames on \\"apostates\\" and anti-Mormons with sinister intentions. In that context, he accepts virtually without question, the Mormon myth of persecuted innocence. Leonard's Nauvoo is far too black and white for any historian to accept, and I would hope that the non-historians interested in the subject would be more discerning as well. Leonard also steps away from the role of the historian as analyzer to moralize on the tragic results of sin and rebellion against Joseph Smith Jr.'s authority. Inevery instance, this work is a morality play and not a history.every instance, this work is a morality play and not a history.	2003-08-10

In the last few years memoirs have appeared by astronauts Gene Cernan, John Glenn, Gordon Cooper, Wally Schirra, Alan Bean, Deke Slayton, Alan Shepard, Gene Cernan, Jim Lovell, Apollo flight directors Gene Kranz and Chris Kraft, Marshall Space Flight Center engineer Homer Hickam, Jr., and Lunar Module designer Tom Kelly. This is another memoir from the heroic era of human space flight, but one from a unique vantagepoint. Guenter Wendt was the legendary \\"pad leader\\" for all of the human space launches from the first Mercury mission in 1961 through the last Apollo flights.<br />German born, with a rich accent that remains to the present, as a McDonnell and later North American Rockwell employee Guenter Wendt held responsibility for capsule test, checkout, and launch operations at America's spaceport at Cape Canaveral, Florida. In that capacity he crossed paths with every astronaut and many of NASA's senior officials in a career that ended with his retirement in 1989. This memoir, co-written with Russell Still, is filled with dozens of such stories about those interactions-some classic, many never revealed before, a few embarrassing, even more humorous-about the astronauts, technicians, engineers and other officials Wendt interacted with for three decades.<br />Wendt describes in this book a relentless pursuit of excellence, safety, and security both for his team and the mission under his care. Astronauts respectfully called him \\"Pad Fuhrer,\\" a term not always used with affection. Wendt's emphasis on successfully completing the mission, ensuring the safety of the astronauts, and creatively sidestepping bureaucracy earned the admiration of many. His determined approach to the work, and the way in which he took personal responsibility for what happened on his launch pad became legendary along Florida' Space Coast. Many astronauts recall how Wendt strapped them into their capsules, shook their hands, offered words of support, and closed the hatch, the last person seen before their trip into space. In those moments, they were thankful for his abrasive attention to detail and his forceful leadership on the launch pad.<br />Wendt's memoir is replete with good-natured stories, and some that are not so good-natured, many of which are the stuff of legend. It should come as no surprise to anyone that many astronauts had a wild, devil-may-care side to their personalities.

This is an important issue in the current world, as modern strategists echo the arguments of Billy Mitchell and others about the primacy of the airplane.

This work is, therefore, essentially a biography written with multiple voices and from differing perspectives by the journalists who watched Lincoln's public life. It contains all of the virtues and vices of the reportorial profession. At times the reprinted articles are eloquent and insightful, at others they present gross inaccuracies and exaggerations. All come together to offer a complex portrait of arguably the most significant president of the American republic. Overall, they offer a fascinating representation of Abraham Lincoln and his times.<br />Editor Herbert Mitgang makes clear that the individual articles reprinted in this collection should never be considered objective accounts of Lincoln's activities. Instead, the newspapers of that era were overtly partisan. Even a relatively small city like Lincoln's Springfield, Illinois, had two newspapers, one ardently supportive of Lincoln and the Republicans, the other rabidly hostile. And both reported the same events in strikingly different ways. Readers see repeatedly in this collection the differing reportage of events in Lincoln's life. For instance, accounts of the Lincoln-Douglas debates are sensationalized toward one side or the other depending on the political allegiance of the newspaper reporting them. Mitgang appropriately notes that these reports \\"presented history in the rough\\" (p. xxiv).<br />While this collection ranges across the life of Abraham Lincoln, well over two-thirds of the work is devoted to his presidential career and the Union's victory in the Civil War against the Confederacy. Almost every major military action is discussed in some detail, but more importantly the role of Lincoln in reshaping the nation with the abolition of slavery receives considered attention. The struggles to maintain a ruling coalition and to manage both the radicals of Lincoln's own party and the peace Democrats enter the discussion.

Anderson Jr., explores one of the most critical areas of flight, the evolution of aerodynamics. And the result is a significant work that goes far toward capturing the essence of this field. It will find a place in both aeronautical engineering and history of aeronautics classes, but the greatest importance of &quot;A History of Aerodynamics&quot; will probably be its use as an essential reference by scholars without the technical depth of Anderson working in the history of flight.<br />Anderson divides his subject into four key areas and attacks them chronologically. The first period, requiring nearly 100 pages in this publication, begins with antiquity and ends with the work of the Wright brothers at the beginning of the twentieth century. The second era he characterizes as one dominated by the strut-and-wire biplane of the 1900s through the 1920s. A third definable era came with the mature propeller-driven airplane that emerged in the 1930s and predominated until the 1950s. Then, a fourth era arose in which the jet aircraft has dominated. Anderson would be quick to point out that the last two eras have existed side-by-side since the coming of the jet, but that each of them present different aerodynamics challenges requiring different solutions and, hence, they deserve separate treatment.<br />Three major themes run through &quot;A History of Aerodynamics&quot; from Aristotle to the present. First, the author emphasizes the development of the discipline of aerodynamics-the change over time in the understanding of the physical nature of aerodynamic flows over solid bodies and the discovery and systemization of basic governing equations-much of which emerged independently from a variety of sources and without immediate practical application. For instance, Anderson concludes that with Newtonian physics as a foundation, numerous scientists and mathematicians ranging from Leonhard Euler to Pierre-Simon Laplace working largely individually constructed a framework for aerodynamics that included fundamental understanding of Euler's equations for an inviscid flow and the Navier-Stokes equations for a viscous flow. That effort, however, took place independently of a desire to build flying machines, and indeed many of those working on them scoffed at the idea of human powered flight.<br />Second, it took a group of practical inventors to apply these theoretical aerodynamics principles and build the first practical flying machines in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These individuals, few of whom held academic posts, began the practice of applied aerodynamics. The classic example is Wilbur and Orville Wright who had no advanced degrees and no outside funders, either public or private. The research of these people went directly into the design of airplanes. As Anderson concludes, \\"It is remarkable that the flying machine was developed and advanced well into the beginning of the twentieth century without direct recourse to the state of the art of theoretical aerodynamics that existed in academic circles\\" (pp. 448-49).<br />Finally, Anderson traces the linkage between the aerodynamic theory being developed in the academy and its application to the design of aircraft. Whereas the linkage had been tenuous at best until the second decade of the twentieth century, it has grown increasingly interrelated and complex since. Making airplanes more efficient, safe, and effective has become the raison d'être for aerodynamics research at least since the 1930s. The basic research of Otto Prandtl in Germany and Theodore von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n-himself a Prandtl student-at Caltech exemplify this transformation, as it found its way almost immediately into practical designs.<br />There is much to praise in this volume. It provides for the first time a comprehensive overview of the subject. It also offers the best discussions available about some of the key breakthroughs in the twentiethcentury made by leading aerodynamicists such as Richard Whitcomb, John Stack, and Fred Weick. But for all its virtues, the overview offered here is a history written for engineers. Replete with formulae and technical detail, certainly to be expected in such a history, the author concerns himself with the linear process of aerodynamic understanding to the very great exclusion of any social or cultural factors that might have influenced the engineers.<br />For instance, the author concludes that the era of the modern propeller-driven aircraft was dominated by the requirement to reduce drag, and therefore enhance performance, so a \\"streamlining craze\\" emerged among aerodynamicists that fundamentally altered the direction of the airplane development. Despite many intriguing areas that might have been explored-for example, the story of the adoption of retractable landing gear explored by Walter Vincenti in a 1994 Technology &amp; Culture article-here the progression of streamlining follows a linear pattern, with the text too often emphasizing what comes across as farsighted, preordained solutions to aerodynamics problems that led inexorably to the clean, efficient designs of the 1940s. There is little of the obscurity of choices, blind allies of research, or trial and error that might have enriched this story.<br />Even so, this is a massively impressive work that will be of real use to a large community. It will find use for years to come.e by leading aerodynamicists such as Richard Whitcomb, John Stack, and Fred Weick.

That was in no small measure because of the work of Josiah Gilbert Holland (1819-1881), whose &quot;Life of Abraham Lincoln&quot; was the first full-scale post-assassination biography of Lincoln and a pathmarker that fundamentally shaped the contours of Lincolnia. Published less than a year after Lincoln?s death, Holland told the now well-worn stories of young Lincoln earning his first silver dollar as a rail-splitter, about his repayment for a ruined book, about the millhorse?s kick to his head, about his wrestling match with Jack Armstrong, and about the fabled Lincoln sense of humor and wit. Always, Holland wrote in an accessible, homey manner about Lincoln the man and the patriot, about Lincoln the husband and father, and about Lincoln the moral leader of a nation at war.<br />For example, Holland asserted repeatedly in this biography that Lincoln had been an opponent of slavery his entire life and had always planned for emancipation. A debatable contention at best, but one that certainly hearkened back to the moral vision expressed in the Declaration of Independence penned nearly a century earlier. The assertion certainly fixed the image of the man as a champion of the highest ideals of the republic. Also debatable, and certainly it was roundly attacked at the time by several of Lincoln?s associates, was Holland?s assertion that Lincoln was the very model of a Christian leader. Such longtime associates as William Herndon condemned Holland?s declaration of Lincoln?s religious ideals as bogus.<br />Holland based his biography on relatively extensive interviews with those who knew Lincoln and on the written materials then readily available. Accordingly, there is a depth of coverage not present in many of the other early Lincoln biographies. At the same time, Holland was essentially Lincoln?s Parson Weems, making a myth of the fallen leader second to only that accorded George Washington. As Allen C. Guelzo notes in an excellent introduction to the volume, Holland engaged in oversentimentality, drawing overt morals from the life and career of Lincoln. Holland?s Lincoln, as Guelzo states, ?was unapologetically the champion of ?strength and moderation? and the opposition, whether from John Charles Fr?mont or Clement Vallandigham, was ?irresponsible? or ?treasonable?? (pp. viii-ix). Because of these weaknesses, most modern Lincoln scholars have dismissed Holland?s biography without serious consideration.<br />As a study in the process of myth-making, however, this book is important. Its availability in this reprint edition may provide grist for future studies. As such it is a welcome addition to historical literature.myth of the fallen leader second to only that accorded George Washington. As Allen C.

Born in 1801 before the development of photography, Young lived well into the period when photography had become common in America and died only in 1877. During his life, Young posed for numerous photographers and artists and more than 100 visual representations of him exist. The authors contend that there may well be additional images of Young as yet undiscovered, but that this book includes all known images, and contains as accurate information as possible in dating the image and ascertaining its history.<br />Essentially a reference work, this collection of images is a valuable tool for historians of the Mormons. Together with a useful introduction, essays on various visual techniques, individual images, and aspects of the history of Mormonism and the Great Basin, this work will be useful for many years to scholars, museum professionals, and collectors.	2003-05-31

The victorious Allies divided Germany and Berlin into four zones in 1945, one each for France, Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. As Soviet-American relations deteriorated during 1946 and 1947, the jointly occupied Berlin, located deep inside the Soviet zone, began to be the focus of confrontation between the two ideologies. When the Soviets blockaded the land routes to Berlin from the West in 1948 the Allies responded with a massive airlift that both relieved a surrounded and starving city and avoided direct conflict with the Red Army. It represented a truly decisive use of what I like to call \\"constructive air power.\\"<br />Roger G. Miller's \\"To Save a City\\" seeks to tell the story of this airlift, both its geopolitical and operational elements, in a spare volume that represents an important up-to-date contribution to the subject. A civilian historian with the U.S. Air Force History and Museums Program, Miller draws on official Air Force files, recently declassified documents from the National Archives, Soviet documents released since the end of the Cold War, and interviews with airlift veterans to reconstruct the story of this important Cold War confrontation. The result is a compelling story well told. While other historians have laid out the major parameters of this subject before, this work is a worthy synthesis of those earlier studies and offers a depth of effort not previously offered.<br />Miller begins by discussing the political crisis that led to the airlift. He quickly moves on to the hasty organization of the operation to resupply the city by a small number of antiquated cargo airplanes. This soon evolved into an intricate bridge of modern transports that flowed in and out of Berlin through narrow air corridors on a precise schedule regardless of weather or other conditions. In the slang of the present, this 24/7/365 operation delivered everything from food and medicine to coal and equipment to a besieged Berlin. It allowed airlift forces to hone to a fine edge their doctrine and operational procedures.<br />Miller observes that the Berlin Airlift served to codify the flexibility of airlift as an instrument of national will. If one believes that the military exists as tools to help further the national defense and diplomatic objectives of the nation they serve then the more flexible the tool the more useful it becomes. Fighters and bombers are precise tools useful in only a limited number of circumstances, essentially that involving combat. Military airlift can be used in every conceivable scenario across the spectrum of international relations. A unique national resource, the Berlin Airlift demonstrated its significance.<br />Roger Miller notes that American allies around the world regarded the airlift as a triumph of will, and it solidified the western position in the early Cold War era. The size and extent of the airlift, the requirement for close coordination, and the resourcefulness of allied leadership also impressed the Soviet Union. The airlift affected Air Force doctrine as well; demonstrating that virtually any amount of cargo could be moved anywhere in the world with little concern for geography or weather. It provided valuable experience in operational techniques, air traffic control, and in aircraft maintenance and reconditioning. Finally, as already stated, the Berlin Airlift proved for the first time what has been confirmed many times since: airlift is a more flexible tool for executing national policy than either fighter or bomber aircraft.w air corridors on a precise schedule regardless of weather or other conditions.

The Mormon founder began the practice in the 1830s and established it as a central part of the Mormon religion in the 1840s. It defined the religion's distinctiveness until the beginning of the twentieth century. Accordingly, and appropriately, it has received considerable historical attention. Kathryn Daynes' &quot;More Wives than One&quot; offers an in-depth look at the long-term interaction between belief and the practice of polygamy among the Mormons in the central Utah town of Manti.<br />Following the obligatory, and rather unsatisfactory, opening chapter on the origins of Mormon plural marriage in Kirtland, Ohio, and Nauvoo, Illinois, Daynes begins a sustained analysis of polygamy in Manti. She shows that plural marriage followed no monolithic pattern there, but that each approach had its own rights and responsibilities. Using biographical and demographic data she also demonstrates the factors shaping the practice, analyses the ingredients of plural marriage, and explores how it evolved over time. She discusses how Mormon marriage practices solidified a patriarchal model of society, one that diverged sharply from the &quot;companionate&quot; model of marriage and egalitarian social ideas then taking hold in mainstream America. This divergence prompted resistance from elsewhere in the United States, eventually forcing ending of the practice by the church. This is a well down work that provides important insights into the Mormon's &quot;peculiar institution.&quot;	2003-05-30

The answer: we don't, not if the history is &quot;The Road to Appomattox.&quot; There are, of course, ample reasons to explore again that last year of the war. Perhaps there are new sources to be mined. Perhaps there are new questions to be pondered in considering that strange, sad conflict in 1864-1865. Perhaps there are new insights that might be gleaned from the reconsideration of the wartime experience. The best history written today combines each of these elements to alter perspective and advance understanding.<br />Unfortunately, &quot;The Road to Appomattox&quot; accomplishes none of these critical tasks. It claims to be a &quot;vivid description&quot; of the last year of the war from the point that Ulysses S. Grant took command of all Union forces in the spring of 1864 until the capitulation of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House in April 1865. That may be the book's one positive attribute, for there are certainly no new insights and perspectives offered. But even as an elegant literary exercise I would recommend over this book Bruce Catton's Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;A Stillness at Appomattox&quot; (Doubleday, 1953); Allan Nevins' last book in his eight volume series, &quot;The War for the Union: The Organized War to Victory, 1864-1865&quot; (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1971); and the last volume of Shelby Foote's trilogy, &quot;The Civil War: A Narrative&quot; (Random House, 1974). All of these cover the same subject, and do so with elegance and powerful insight.	2003-05-30

Robert Bruce Flanders' 1965 classic study of Nauvoo, incomplete as it is because of its intentional disregard of social and religious issues, opened an avenue of discussion that most others have been unwilling to follow since that time. Flanders said that he wrote of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, not as a religious leader but as a &quot;man of affairs--planner, promoter, architect, entrepreneur, executive, politician, filibusterer--matters of which he was sometimes less sure than he was those of the spirit.&quot; He also wrote of Mormon Nauvoo as a western boom town and not as a religious &quot;city on a hill.&quot; There is little of the reverence in Flanders' study that most other Mormon scholars have displayed in handling the subject; the sacred history approach has created a romanticized and superficial image of Nauvoo and the events that took place there.<br />As interpreted by Flanders, Nauvoo is largely a story of tragedy, both personally for Joseph Smith and collectively for the Mormons. For Flanders, the lofty visions that had led to the founding of the Latter Day Saint church descended into a secular quagmire of economics and politics because of internal flaws and external pressures on the banks of the Mississippi. Ultimately, the city failed and the church fractured.	2003-05-26

It too often reduces the actual complexity of events, avoids matters that challenge or contradict Mormon myth, views the Mormons as good and their opponents as evil, and all too often ignores the cultural context of the early church. It deals with the Mormon experience in a defensive manner while fostering the myth of Mormon innocence and religious persecution. Roberts emphasizes the persecution of the Mormons for religious reasons, but fails to explore systematically the causes of conflict that led to the assassinations of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, and his brother, Hyrum Smith, in Carthage, Illinois, in 1844.	2003-05-26

That has been a subject of considerable investigation by many observers. This book collects some of the more thoughtful recent explorations of this theme. The fifteen essays in this volume collect several of those previously published in journals as well as adding three that appear here for the first time.<br />This collection is a welcome addition to the literature on the Mormon prophet neither for its exhaustive consideration nor for the insights offered, but because it collects in one place several important articles on the place of Joseph Smith in the history of American religion.

Certainly the invention and development of the airplane has fundamentally altered the lives of all individuals on this planet. It has made possible the movement of both inanimate cargo and living things anywhere in the world in less than a day. That means that both lifesaving medicines and the most deadly viruses are only a planeride away from anywhere on the globe. The airplane has also made possible both pathbreaking scientific research not duplicable in any other environment and the dropping of devastating bombs on targets far removed from the front line of battle. Its positive and its destructive uses became an important part of the fabric of human life during the century just past.<br />The state of Illinois has been a place important to the development of the airplane in the twentieth century and this book by Howard L. Scamehorn is an welcome chronicle of that role for the first half of the century. &quot;Balloons to Jets&quot; is a reprint of a classic work that first appeared in 1957. Well-received at the time, and justifiably so, it has remained the standard work on aeronautics in Illinois to the present.<br />Scamehorn covered the full range of activities in aviation during the period between 1855 and 1955, beginning with ballooning in the latter half of the nineteenth century through the various activities taking place in Illinois to mid-century. Accordingly, he deals with the rise of the aviation industry, air meets and contests, barnstorming, the air mail, military aeronautics, the development of airlines, sport and utility flying, the growth of airports from bonfires and grass strips to navigational transponders and rental care agencies, and the development of the regulatory environment. Of course, appearing as it did in 1957, &quot;Balloons to Jets&quot; only touched on the revolution in aeronautics that came with the development of jet transports.<br />Nearly fifty years have passed since &quot;Balloons to Jets&quot; was first published and no one has yet provided an overview narrative of aviation in Illinois that updates this work for the period since the 1950s. Since that is the case, I wish the author had written a few additional chapters that could have been included in this reprint to &quot;Balloons to Jets.&quot; I do not want to complain too loudly, however, for it is nonetheless an excellent work.

Hyslop, might well do so. It has many of the necessary ingredients. Its palate is sweeping, and the author's handling of the story both complex and captivating. More than any other recent work of history on the Santa Fe trail and trade, it captures the essence of the story and relates it to an audience removed from it by some 175 years. Most of all, \\"Bound for Santa Fe\\" is an exceptionally well-written work of history, tantalizing in its depictions and seductive in the power of its narrative.<br />Beginning with the earliest exploring parties from the United States into the Southwest, Hyslop takes the reader through the origins and development of the Santa Fe trade, using narratives from the trail as the centerpiece of a journey from Missouri to New Mexico. Along the trail readers meet the native peoples who had made the region their homes for centuries, the Santa Fe culture and its sometimes uneasy coexistence with Anglos from Missouri, and the unique world these various cultures made through their interactions.<br />At the same time, the interactions proved surprising to both sides. As only one example, Missourians expressed dismay at the mores of the New Mexicans, and that cultural divide never seemed to end despite years of close contact. When trader John Scolly hauled his Latina wife, Juana Lopes, before a Mexican judge for adultery the outcome was remarkably different to what Scolly had expected. Lopes did not deny the charges, instead offering the belligerent explanation, as reported in the court record, that \\"it was her ass, she controlled it, and she would give it to whomever she wanted\\" (p. 266). The judge told her to quit \\"roving\\" and stay with her family but stopped short of punishing her, as would have undoubtedly been the case in the U.S. Such cultural differences sprinkle this work, demonstrating the oddity and attraction of these two civilizations.<br />Hyslop completes his work with a discussion of American conquest of New Mexico in 1846-1848. He follows the path of the Army of the West under Stephen Watts Kearny, the experience of Alexander Doniphan and Sterling Price and their Missouri volunteers, the creation of a territorial government under Charles Bent, and the bloody Taos revolt.<br />In 1979 John D. Unruh Jr. published \\"The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840-60\\" (University of Illinois Press), unraveling the complex story of the overlanders on America's longest trail.

With the development of ballistic missiles in the 1950s, for the first time in the history of the United States our two great oceans could not protect us from sustained attack and destruction. To warn against a Soviet ballistic missile attack, and thereby to allow time for the launch of a counterattack, the Department of Defense sponsored the development of satellites ringing the globe that would use infrared photographic technology to detect missile launches. The theory behind the system was that the heat signature from the rocket blast would be detected by satellites in space and then show up on infrared scopes at military monitoring posts. Through this process the time and place of launch, as well as the missile trajectory, could be ascertained within seconds of launch.<br />It was a brilliant concept but it took years for it to come to fruition. The first effort, Project MIDAS, experienced numerous technical problems, but finally reached a turning point in 1963 when MIDAS 7 detected the first missile launch from space. MIDAS confirmed the concept, and the DSP program, with first launch in 1970, has provided early warning of missile launches ever since. Through 1997 eighteen DSP satellites had been placed in orbit, not all of them operational of course at the same time.<br />Jeffrey T. Richelson's history of this program, \\"America's Space Sentinels,\\" is an especially important and welcome addition to the literature of the military space program. It provides as comprehensive an understanding of this effort as is possible in the current environment, using a wealth of declassified documents to piece together this program's evolution from idea to implementation and operational life. It is, of course, not the final word on this subject because of still-classified materials that should one day be made available about DSP, but it represents a benchmark in the historiography.<br />Especially welcome is Richelson's discussion of DSP's employment in the post-cold war era. He provides an excellent overview of its use to detect Scud missile launches in the Gulf War of 1991. He also describes how it detected the test firing of a new Iranian missile in 1998 and its use in piecing together the details of airplane accidents, such as the September 1997 collision of American and German military aircraft off the Atlantic coast of Africa. He ends with a discussion of the follow-on missile launch detection program, the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), which is due to come on line at the end of the century.<br />From the time when DSP served as the backbone of the nation's strategic early warning system during the cold war through its continued use in the still very threatening climate of the 1990s to its replacement by a presumably more capable system, this book is an important contribution to the public's understanding of space-based military systems.

A volunteer unit formed in June 1846, just after the declaration of war against Mexico, the 1st Missouri formed an integral part of the Army of West led by Colonel Stephen Watts Kearny. Under the command of Alexander William Doniphan-an able young Missouri lawyer, militiaman, and politician-the 1st Missouri performed admirably in the conquest of New Mexico and northern Mexico in 1846-1847. He led it on an epic march of 3,600 miles throughout the Southwest, commanding it to victory over two larger Mexican forces at El Brazito and Sacramento. Joseph G. Dawson III, on the faculty at Texas A&amp;M University, tells this story with enthusiasm and pungency.<br />The significance of Dawson's work rests on his analysis of the role of citizen soldiers in the wars of America, using Doniphan as a case study, both in the context of combat operations and in military governance of captured territory. In many respects Doniphan was a Cincinnatus at the plough, answering the call of his people to defeat perceived enemies. As such he was like many other Americans both before and since. Dawson explores this issue in relation to the nineteenth century American military establishment, an establishment that gave Doniphan, and indeed all other non-career officers, grudging respect at best. In a rare episode, the Army even invited Doniphan to address the cadets at West Point in the aftermath of the war. Dawson concludes that such citizen soldiers as Doniphan have been an important source of strength for the United States throughout its history. Yet they have received scant attention and even less analysis by military historians.<br />Dawson also uses Doniphan to evaluate the role of the military in governing conquered foreign provinces. This was something that the United States did not have to deal with before the Mexican-American War. But the acquisition of New Mexico and California by invasion of the Army of the West raised important questions about the status of the peoples residing there and the form of government to be established. Doniphan's legal background made him an ideal advisor to Kearny as he dealt with these questions in relation to New Mexico. With the mission of bringing New Mexico into the United States, Doniphan counseled Kearny to swear its residents to allegiance to the conquering nation and to establish a civilian government as expeditiously as possible. Kearny did just that, and Doniphan wrote both an oath of allegiance used throughout the territory and a law code that served well the now U.S.-controlled territory of New Mexico. This approach, championed by Doniphan, set a precedent that has continued.<br />&quot;Doniphan's Epic March&quot; is a good book. It is solidly researched and well written.
