Although \\"The Wilding\\" is billed as a sequel to the unforgettable \\"In Conquest Born,\\" which was written more than a decade and a half ago, if you're a newcomer to C.S. Friedman's works, don't worry. While this novel picks up the \\"Never Ending War\\" generations later, the characters are new, and the situation is very different.<br /><br />Friedman uses the old twins separated at birth plot as central to this episodic work dealing with the overthrow of a tyrant. Less a novel than a series of incidents that coalesce at the end, the point of view keeps shifting, even within chapters sometimes.<br /><br />With this author, there are always complications, and you need to be on the alert for foreshadowings and surprises. You need to keep careful track of the characters, too--fortunately there's a glossary to help out.<br /><br />Friedman writes well, and she creates fascinating characters, all of whom become pawns in a game that's greater than they know. I hope it doesn't take another 15 years before the author drops back into this universe.	2005-10-10

If \\"Komarr,\\" the previous novel in the series, was the darkest, \\"A Civil Campaign\\" is the lightest. The author bills it as \\"A Comedy of Biology and Manners,\\" and that's precisely what it is. Call it a \\"space operetta,\\" if you like.<br /><br />Ms. Bujold centers this take around Miles's pursuit of the hand of Ekaterin, widowed at the end of \\"Komarr,\\" which really should be read before you tackle this one. And there are subplots inivolving Miles's clone brother Mark, designer goody-producing insects, and much intrigue concerning the various members of the Council of Counts, among them Count Dono, who--err, no.

So, let's get the comparisons out of the way first. No, this isn't another \\"Waking the Moon\\" (although Balthazar Warnick turns up in a cameo), but it's brilliant in its own way. Impeccably written, it spans two eras and is told from three different pov's. It's populated with semi-eminent Victorians, both real and imaginary, human and nonhuman, mortal and immortal, as well as a cast of contemporary characters. Most are mad to some extent. Some even realize that they are.<br /><br />Ms. Hand, master of the lush descriptive passage, is brilliant at creating a sense of place, especially with her descriptions of 19th-century Cornwall and 21st-century London. Maybe you'll feel as if you've dropped in for a visit. She also has a way of making the bizarre seem at least semi-normal (a border collie that apparently would place in a NASCAR race), and she's playfully suspenseful (going Hitchcock one better, she serves up a McGuffin but in the end simply tosses it away). The book's tightly plotted and the obsessed characters seem real, for who among us has not fallen victim to obsessive love at one time or another?<br /><br />A warning for those few of you who may have stumbled upon this without knowing a thing about \\"Waking the Moon\\": Ms. Hand apparently expects her readers to bring something to the table with them. In this case that would be a knowledge of Art History, Victorian life and literature, the pre-Raphaelites, Celtic (and other) mythology, and Jungian pyschology. And a knowledge of British Geography wouldn't hurt either.<br /><br />I've only one question: does Daniel go home in the car or the motorcycle?	2005-09-17

The author is always objective, and his sourcing would seem to be impeccable. For the most part he uses sources who will speak on the record, and when they would not he claims to have verified what they've said with others. And source notes and a bibliography are provided.<br /><br />In Mr. Mnookin's version, the story focuses on what happens to people who make wrong choices that they easily could have avoided--that is, if they were not the prisoners of their own ideology and life experiences. The account starts with the misguided notion of New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. that the head of the op-ed page, Howell Raines, a narcissistic, inflexible left-wing ideologue best known for his invective-laden editorials against, mostly, conservatives, but also Bill Clinton, could function as the newspaper's executive editor, in which position he would be in charge, not of a small group of like-minded ideologues, but of a newsroom with hundreds of employees of varying opinions and, of course, abilities.<br /><br />Generalissimo Raines couldn't function in that job, and in the process of failing he managed to alienate most of the staff while turning the newspaper into the journalistic version of a banana republic, led of course by himself.<br /><br />Then, the author moves on to the equally bizarre decision by Raines and his no. 2, managing editor Gerald Boyd, to send Jayson Blair out on big stories (the DC Sniper, Jessica Lynch). Blair, a dimestore sociopath, fantasist, and substance abuser, had already been warned by his direct supervisors about his job performance, but Raines and Boyd would eventually claim, improbably, not to know of this when the scandal broke.<br /><br />And scandal there would be. Blair would repay their trust in him with plagiarism, after which he graduated to fabrication, and ended up writing stories with out-of-town datelines without ever having left the Times Building on West 43rd St. in New York. (In the process, as Mr. Mnookin outlines, he demonstrated creative uses for cell phones and photo archives.)<br /><br />When Blair was exposed and forced to resign, the Times assembled a group of reporters and editors to investigate every story Blair had written, and the result was the sensational report that appeared in the paper one fateful Sunday in May 2003.<br /><br />That report made the Times the butt of jokes, and within two months Raines and Boyd were fired; then, after a brief interregnum in which the previous executive editor, Joe Lelyveld, who Raines disdained, returned to pick up the shattered pieces, Sulzberger selected Bill Keller, who had been passed over in favor of Raines two years before. Keller moved rapidly to restore order and institute changes, among them the hiring of the Times's first public editor.<br /><br />As for Mr. Sulzberger, he escaped unscathed--which is unsurprising: his family owns the New York Times Corp.<br /><br />The book is compulsive reading. Even though the outcome is known, \\"Hard News\\" nevertheless has the feel of a police procedural. Maybe you'll start imagining who might be cast as the principals if (or should I say when) there's a movie made of this cautionary tale.with plagiarism, after which he graduated to fabrication, and ended up writing stories with out-of-town datelines without ever having left the Times Building on West 43rd St. in New York.

Paige is the titular head of a coven of witches that lives in a New England town, and most of the women seem afraid of their powers.<br /><br />Paige is struggling not only to improve the coven but also to deal with Savannah, whose mother has been killed (in another book in the series). Savannah is hip in the way of adolescents, and she doesn't like \\"humans\\" much. She wants to be a witch--a powerful one, who can do more the \\"dimestore\\" magic of her guardian. (So, for that matter, would Paige herself.) The two are about to get the chance, thanks to a snarky custody battle over Savannah, which starts the trouble.<br /><br />While the book is part of a series, you need not have read previous books in it to enjoy this one. It's funny at times (a creepily hilarious scene in a funeral parlor is pure Addams Family), sexy at times, and the last 60 or so pages are plain horrifying.<br /><br />No words wasted here.

And more. Mr. Black seems to have looked into just about everything ever written about FDR and his contemporaries, synthesized the information, annotated it impeccably, and turned out a crisply written work that is sure to impress and intrigue.<br /><br />Mr. Black never hesitates to inject his opinions--constantly offering his ideas of What Might Have Been if, for example, FDR had placed General MacArthur in charge of Overlord (as if!), and he leaves no doubt as to what he thinks of FDR's contemporaries. Churchill and General Marshall rate highly; De Gaulle less so; and Chiang Kai Shek not at all. Eleanor Roosevelt comes across as well-meaning but sanctimonious and humorless, while the monstrous Stalin is depicted as having perhaps one or two instincts that maybe just might barely be considered those of a human being.<br /><br />The author is brilliant at describing events in FDR's life, seldom wandering off into nonessentials. The section dealing with the period between Hoover's defeat and FDR's inauguration is a masterpiece--as poor Clueless Herbert Hoover keeps trying to entrap the far too clever FDR into continuing his failed economic policies.<br /><br />Unlike many, he neither idolizes nor demonizes FDR, but tries to strike a balance. The author leaves no doubt that the president was devious, sometimes cruel. On the other hand, Mr. Black suggests that it was the president's disability that instilled him with compassion for the poor. (The author notes that FDR, who was almost never photographed in his wheelchair, did allow wounded veterans to see him in the chair, so that they would realize what a disabled person could accomplish.) The author also demonstrates what a political genius Roosevelt was. There is a fascinating passage dealing with FDR's election as Governor of New York in 1928. Al Smith, his predecessor and the 1928 Democratic presidential candidate, wanted a figurehead, so that he could continue to run the state behind the scenes. FDR had other ideas, as he would quickly demonstrate.<br /><br />Regarding perhaps the two greatest controversies of FDR's long presidency, Mr. Black makes it clear that while FDR's health was failing by the time of the Yalta Conference he was still intellectually astute and that the conference was in no way influenced by the mechanations of Alger Hiss; and he notes that while it is certain that FDR knew, and expected, the Japanese to attack (although he did not know where), he nevertheless was appalled at the unreadiness of the fleet at Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />Essential reading.8 Democratic presidential candidate, wanted a figurehead, so that he could continue to run the state behind the scenes.

For the first time she meets her parents-in-law, Douglas and Charlotte, and her brother-in-law Whit. Against a background of drought and the possibility of forest fires, an old family feud is played out in front of Isabel--who's exactly the wrong person to be the audience. She's one of those people who can take any bad situation and make it worse.<br /><br />Isabel's a mess. She works in environmental protection and has spent her entire adult life in New York, Baltimore, London, and New York again. Now she's actually seeing \\"the environment\\" for the first time; it's more than she expected. In flashbacks we learn that her first husband was bipolar and suffered from serious bouts of depression. She has an adolescent son she has no idea how to talk to (she won't discuss drugs with him because she's afraid she might learn he's taking them); and when she calls her first husband's doctor to learn how he is progressing with his latest treatments, she is curtly told he cannot discuss the case with her (implying she's the cause of his illness), and she does not even confront him.<br /><br />Roxana Robinson relates all this in a lean photorealist prose style. There is no excess; but she tells you everything you need to know. Her descriptive passages are so lush, you'll probably smell the fish in the water, and the smoke and ash of an oncoming forest fire. The tale unfolds in traditional novel style--no picture inserts; just one typeface; no blank pages. And while there are sections in the early chapters that might just as well come supplied with the label FORESHADOWING in Arial bold, when the events occur or issues are resolved, the resolution never happens quite the way you'd suppose.<br /><br />Superb.the label FORESHADOWING in Arial bold, when the events occur or issues are resolved, the resolution never happens quite the way you'd suppose. <br /> <br />Superb.	2005-07-11

This time he focuses on \\"Snow White\\" and comes up with a breathtakingly original idea: cast Lucrezia Borgia in the role of the evil queen.<br /><br />By the time you finish you may even convince yourself that the fairy tale was in fact a parable about the Borgia Duchessa (it wasn't of course), and you'll pick up some knowledge about the historical period too.<br /><br />\\"Mirror\\" is more sophisticated than Maguire's most famous novel, \\"Wicked,\\" his version of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" from the point of view of the wicked witch. It requires more from the reader too--a knowledge of the Borgias, and of the historical moment when the late Middle Ages became the early Renaissance.<br /><br />Mr. Maguire is clearly less interested in the character of Snow White herself, here called Bianca de Nevada (beautiful but dull more than somewhat) than in Lucrezia Borgia herself. And his rendition of the eight (yes eight) dwarves is playful (MuteMuteMute is talkative, Heartless is sensitive, etc.).<br /><br />This should appeal to Mr. Maguire's legions of fans and to admirers of Umberto Eco as well.	2005-06-16

There's a gender-bending twist--Claire has a young son and a husband at home--but other than that the story could easily have appeared in 1956.<br /><br />This is far from a bad effort, but (especially if you're a longtime sf-fan) it's possible you'll wonder why this gifted and original writer wanted to do this. It's like a talented singer-songwriter who spins out a whole album of covers--and covers that are merely syllable for syllable renditions of the originals at that.

In this episode Phedre--courtesan, spy, linguist, sexual masochist--takes her longest journey yet, in order to free her old friend Hyacinthe from his indentured servitude, as related in \\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" the first of the three novels.<br /><br />Phedre's quest, set in an alt-Renaissance earth about which we learn more than in the previous two tales (what? Carthage survived here?), takes Phedre and her companion Jocelin far from her native \\"Terre d'Ange\\" (our world's France) all the way to our Lake Victoria, as she searches for the key that will release Hyacinthe from his captivity. Her journey is harrowing and its centerpiece--a descent into a hellish land--is so dark as to be almost unbearable.<br /><br />Throughout, Ms. Carey demonstrates her knowledge of ancient history, religions, and languages in addition to her storytelling skills. As before, the story is told in the first person from Phedre's point of view, and without any cheating. Readers see only what Phedre sees, and as before she writes for future readers of her world, not ours.

Instead his enemies, in the company and outside it, used the ball as an excuse to start a power play that would bring him down. As sometimes happens, however, they brought themselves down as well.<br /><br />The book is almost like a musical comedy in structure. The title is somewhat misleading as the ball itself comes in the middle of the book (imagine the ball as the big production number that brings the curtain down on act one). It begins with James's father, Henry, skips quickly through James's adolescence and early manhood (there'll be a production number having to do with James's hobby, racing horsedrawn carriages), the premature death of his father, and his rise to the first vice presidency of the insurance company, where, or so his father had hoped, he would be tutored by the interim president, James W. Alexander, who was nearing retirement age.<br /><br />When the curtain rises on act 2, you will encounter an array of schemers, some driven almost batty as they struggle for power, and a parade of the gilded age financiers, J. P. Morgan, E. H. Harriman, Henry Clay Frick, and James Fortune Ryan, as well as President Theodore Roosevelt, ex-President Grover Cleveland, and Charles Evans Hughes, who would some day be, thanks largely to his investigation of the scandal, Chief Justice of the United States.<br /><br />You'll maybe hear patter songs in your head as the robber barons form committees, make deals, break deals, and leak their doings to the press, as they scheme to acquire the faltering company for themselves.<br /><br />And when the curtain comes down on the tale as the chastened but hardly impoverished Hyde leaves for France--saying his goodbyes aboard the ship that's about to sail perhaps--it comes down, as well, on the Gilded Age itself.<br /><br />Notes and asides: The afterword, about Hyde's later life and that of his son, who was in the OSS during WWII should not be skipped.saying his goodbyes aboard the ship that's about to sail perhaps--it comes down, as well, on the Gilded Age itself. <br /> <br />Notes and asides: The afterword, about Hyde's later life and that of his son, who was in the OSS during WWII should not be skipped.	2005-05-02

James's latest (its copyright date is 2003), and darkest, police procedurial yet, her detective, Scotland Yard Superintendant Adam Dalgliesh, expresses the hope that the case his squad is working on won't be much publicized because of other (unspecified) events that are going on.<br /><br />How daring! Ms. James almost seems to be mocking the cozy conventions of the traditional British mystery she's the Grand Mistress of. It's as if she's saying to her readers, \\"with all this stuff going on the world today, how important is my latest novel in the overall scheme of things?\\"<br /><br />Important enough, I submit, to satisfy all her fans. After all these years the author isn't afraid to take a while--a long while--to establish the scene, a small family-run museum devoted to the history of the UK in the years between World War I and World II, along with the characters who will become suspects (a lonely, self-absorbed and obsessed lot), and their motivations. And it takes place in late autumn, with darkness falling in late afternoon, which adds to the overall gloom.<br /><br />The title of the book stems from one of the exhibit areas in the museum. It's called the murder room, and it displays details of some English murders of the inter-war period (Ms. James, in her introductory note, informs us the murders actually took place), and it might be that the murder is attempting to re-enact one of them.<br /><br />Predictably, the victim (and he's far from the usual dolt you're not sorry to see check out early) is the one all the suspects have reason to want out of the way. The story is told from multiple points of view, which aids in the way the author presents her clues, and she never cheats.<br /><br />Notes and asides: Emma from \\"Death in Holy Orders\\" returns for an encore.

The author's heroine, Tremaine Valiarde (daughter of Nicholas Valiarde from \\"Death of the Necromancer\\"), is enlisted--well she enlists herself really in order to avoid her suicidal impulses. As Florian the young witch tells her: \\"It's like you're two people. One of them is a flighty artist, and I like her. The other one is bloody-minded and ruthless and finds scary things funny and I'm not sure I like her very much.\\"<br /><br />Whatever she is, she, along with her magical sphere that seems to have a mind of its own and can provide a counter-attack against the Gardier, turns into one of the most fascinatingly capable (if neurotic) protagonists you're likely to meet on the pages of any book. And in addition you'll meet not only her and the young witch, but also a host of people, from several societies on two different worlds. And there are plenty of scaring things to be encountered also.<br /><br />The author's burnished prose moves along in a stately fashion, overcoming along the way a few apparent deficiencies in the plot. Ms. Wells occasionally manages to write herself into a corner, forcing her to create side quests to resolve plot issues that she needn't have created in the first place. On the whole, though, the author delivers on her promises.<br /><br />Notes and asides: \\"The Wizard Hunters\\" is, yes, the first of three; but it concludes satisfactorily.

After an absolutely stunning prologue set in a convent, the story itself--a first-person narrative related by Alessandra Cecchi, and which readers are told is the testament of \\"Sister Lucrezia,\\" begins. Alessandra starts her voyage of discovery in 1492, at which point the Medicis rule Florence while Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia--father of Cesare and THAT Lucrezia) rules Rome.<br /><br />Alessandra, then 14, is the rebel of her prosperous family, quarrelling with her brothers and contemptuous of her older sister. The family intellectual, she is interested in art and strives to be a painter at a time when this was hardly a career choice for women. Soon, to complicate matters, a man described only as \\"The Painter\\" arrives from the \\"North,\\" on a commission from Alessandra's merchant father to paint the Ceccis' private chapel. Naturally Alessandra is intrigued; naturally her mother ensures there shall be no funny business between the two. But of course . . .<br /><br />Soon the city falls into disorder because of the preaching of the \\"Mad Monk\\" Savonarola; the French army is on the way; Alessandra herself hastily marries. She learns that her husband (the marriage is, as was then customary, arranged for her by her parents) has secrets to reveal and Alessandra, with the aid of her slave Erila, does discover some of them, and reacquaints herself with The Painter. Hmm . . .<br /><br />Finally after plague, civil disorder, a serial killer who mutilates his victims' bodies, Savonarola's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities,\\" which leads to his downfall (as the fanatic cleric's reign of error topples, Alessandra gives birth in what has to be one of the most excruciating \\"birthing a baby\\" scenes ever portrayed in literature), Alessandra joins the convent that we'd visited in the prologue.<br /><br />And the book falls apart.<br /><br />Up to this point Alessandra has been portrayed as a strong, rebellious woman and now, when it would seem clear (although apparently not to the author) that she does have other choices, to the convent she goes. She's bet heavily and won, and now the reader is supposed to believe that now she is simply going to meekly take what they give her? I don't think so.<br /><br />It's a sad thing, really. It's like watching a gymnast on the uneven bars heading for what would seem to be a gold medal performance, but then miss the most simple exchange in her routine as she prepares for her dismount and tumble awkwardly to the mat.<br /><br />Notes and Asides: No. Whoever The Painter is, Michelangelo he is not.

She's become involved, well stranded more or less, on a double-planet system revolving around Cavanagh's Star. (How this came to pass is explained in \\"Pearl.\\")<br /><br />This time out, Frankland finds herself engaged in an intricate quadrille with three other terrestrial species as well as a sea-dwelling one. Frankland, a former cop who had specialized in ecological crimes back in the UK, can't go home to Earth because of the life-extending and life-protecting c'naatat, which various interests want for obvious reasons, and would take her into custody. So she hooks up with the wess'har Aras, who also has been infected with it, and who's appointed himself the protector of the sea-dwellers. They, along with a human colony, occupy one of the double planets; the wess'har occupy the other.<br /><br />While this might sound like standard space opera it's actually anything but, because the author is as much interested in her characters as she is in the action, which is far from a bad thing. And the characters, alien as well as human, are for the most part over the top. Among the aliens, the matriarchical wess'har, and you'll meet a few, have very alien ways of showing who's the alpha; the ussissi act as translators; the cities of the isenj (they want to make deals with the EU for tech) are crowded more than somewhat. As for the humans: we have Eddie, who becomes the journalist with the heart of gold; Rayat is a creepy spy; and then there's everyone's worst nightmare, the sociopathic Lindsay Neville, the commander of the original expedition to Cavanagh's, who's not wired well at all.<br /><br />There's a political element to the tale as well: Ms. Traviss, who's British, imagines a future in which the European Union is a major player in the space race, with the other nations less enthusiastic about the idea that humans have contacted other intelligent species. Then too, the author has a rather Green outlook. Some readers are likely to agree with the author's ideas (humans, called gethes by the wess'har, are greedy warlike beasts who prey on the enviroment and then pray for forgiveness). Other readers may be put off. Nevertheless, the story never turns preachy.

Those readers who enjoyed Mr. Westerfeld's \\"The Risen Empire,\\" but were majorly (or even minorly) disappointed by its abrupt ending that left the tale half untold will be delighted to know that they can read this \\"sequel\\" without fear of being once again left hanging. Things are wrapped up nicely this time.<br /><br />\\"Killing of Worlds\\" serves up more of the author's character-based space opera (I called \\"Risen Empire\\" a space-soap opera), with no heroes and no villains--just people doing what they do. Once again, the tale is told from multiple points of view (whose pov you're now entering is clear from the chapter titles), with most of the characters from part I back (including the dead cats) and with some new ones as well. This time the centerpiece is a terrific space duel betwen Laurent Zai of the space frigate Lynx and a ship from the enemy empire of the tech-enhanced Rix.<br /><br />While the chase is going on Zai's lover, Senator Nara Oxham, is involved in a political duel of her own--against the immortal \\"Risen Emperor\\" of the Eighty Worlds, who has a secret that needs to be revealed. And in addition a Rix commander and her lover are aiding a Rix-designed AI \\"compound mind\\" that calls itself Alexander.<br /><br />The author moves things along swiftly to a breathtaking (and worldshaking) conclusion. Maybe you'll be surprised when the mystery at the heart of the tale (i.e., the Emperor's secret) is uncovered, but if so, you'll probably slap your forehead and think you should have seen it coming--the clues have been there from the start.<br /><br />Exciting. Well written. Fascinating tech. What more could you ask for? Well, a real sequel, perhaps?	2005-02-03

She is sent to Earth to remove Lunae from the scene.<br /><br />The baroque characters are amazingly well drawn (even the minor ones) as they bash about, none quite knowing exactly what's going on (with the possible exception of Yskatarina), among creatures real and not real, alive and dead, human and mechanical.<br /><br />In a previous book the author has acknowledged the influence of Jack Vance, and that influence certainly appears in this tale, too, with its vivid portrayals of strange worlds, strange creatures, and dry dialog. But this isn't a tribute by any means. It's a fine piece of work in its own right.<br /><br />There's a banner on the front cover in which readers are advised that Liz Williams is \\"an author to watch.\\" Just so.

It's both an homage to the Victorian novels, but with a very postmodern outlook, as well as a critique of them. Does it re-create the Victorian era? Well, not exactly. Does it re-create the Victorian novel? Again, not exactly. Let's just say that while its setting is Victorian, its sensibility is very much 21st century. The author warns you on the first page that his vision of mid-Victorian London may not be what you were expecting, and that you do not belong here. \\"The truth is that you are an alien from another time and place altogether.\\"<br /><br />In time, this becomes quite apparent. For example, Mr. Faber presents you with the classic \\"madwoman,\\" but offers up a reason for her madness that Dickens, say, wouldn't have known about. And his prostitute's heart is far from golden. There's a Christmas scene, but it's far from heartwarming. So beware.<br /><br />However: What \\"Crimson Petal\\" surely will do is continously surprise and delight readers who will allow themselves to be surprised and delighted, while those who resist will be bored. And it won't take very long for you to discover which sort of reader you are.<br /><br />Clever, maybe too clever by half (although deliberately so), the author assumes the role of guide, as he shows his readers the contrast between the genteel life of a prosperous perfume maker with the ugly (and smelly) life of the lower orders, while he ironically follows the rise of the prostitute Sugar from her brothel to her digs as a kept woman, and eventually to governess in the house of the perfumer.<br /><br />The author's style intrigues; he tells the tale of the past in the present tense, and he does it with nudges and winks, as he introduces you to the many characters he's populated the tale with. It's sometimes funny, at other times sad, but it's never sentimental.<br /><br />The plot? Don't worry about it. What there exists of one is rudimentary and often rambling.

Margaret Atwood, official literary person, has once again written a work of science fiction. This is hardly a bad thing. While comparisons with Swift and Orwell are inevitable, \\"Oryx and Crake\\" seems to owe as much if not more to the satirical apocalyptic \\"if this trend goes on\\" novels of the mid 20th century.  It reads like a work that might have been serialized in \\"Galaxy\\" science fiction in the days before the editors featured Cordwainer Smith's \\"Ballad of Lost C'Mell\\" as their cover story. Then, as here, the worlds of advertising and marketing often bore the brunt of the satire.<br /><br />Ms. Atwood, a witty graceful writer, has always treated the genre with respect (\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" was her \\"exile in Orwellville\\"). You probably won't ever feel while venturing through this book that she's slumming at all. (Does Phillip Roth even know who Harry Turtledove is?) And while I have no idea what works of science fiction she's read, it wouldn't surprise me at all to learn among them are the tales of Heinlein, Pohl, and perhaps P. K. Dick.<br /><br />\\"Oryx and Crake\\" (she the blank slate; he the narcissistic sociopath) is told in flashback from the point of view of Jimmy, who's perhaps the last surviving Homo sapiens left after a plague seems to have devastated earth (an all too plausible future earth in which the wealthy live in gated communities and the rest live in the \\"pleeblands\\"). Ms. Atwood sets Jimmy up as the humanist-romantic skeptic to Crake's messianic certainty, and to Oryx, who simply plays the hand she's dealt without seeming to have noticed the other players have aces up their sleeves. Or not. Maybe she does, and just doesn't care.	2004-12-13

When you're the author of an ongoing series--especially one as beloved by fans as is this one--you're confronted with the problem of character development. You can simply ignore the issue altogether--as Rex Stout famously did for 40 years with the never-aging Nero Wolfe--or you can do as Lois Bujold has done--allow her character to grow.<br /><br />\\"Komarr\\" finishes Miles's transition (which started in \\"Memory\\") from youthful adventure to \\"auditor\\" (roving troubleshooter) and confidant of Emperor Gregor of Barrayar. In \\"Memory\\" he was given a temporary assignment, and now, age 30, his position permanent, he is sent to Komarr (which is still restive about being placed under the Imperial administration) to investigate the sabotage of a terraforming project. During his investigation Miles encounters for the first time Ekaterin Vorsoisson, and falls in love while wrapping up the case.<br /><br />The book, told both from Miles's and Ekaterin's points of view, is darker, more pensive than previous books. Ekaterin, with a nine-year-old son, is trapped in an unhappy marriage to a mid-level civil servant. The author devotes an entire chapter to Ekaterin's attempts to sexually please a man she can hardly stand any more, and the entire tale is filled with emotional issues. As for Miles, he of course still plunges ahead with his customary elan, but with more maturity, and with a shock of recognition or two along the way.<br /><br />As always readers need not have read previous books in the series to enjoy this one although (especially considering the time line the author helpfully provides in the appendix) it's hard to imagine many new readers would choose this volume as their point of entry.	2004-12-04

It's set between 1918 and 1923. The series is based on the idea that the Confederacy won at Antietam, won the Civil War, won what is called the \\"Second Mexicn War\\" 20 years later, and while allied with hardly mentioned France and Britain lost to a Teddy Roosevelt-led USA allied with the German Empire (\\"Kaiser Bill\\" is still in charge Over There as the trilogy commences).<br /><br />This series is pure alt-hist. No invading space aliens, no magic; and it contains all the plusses (and alas the minuses) Mr. Turtledove's readers have come to expect. We have the usual vast array of characters, most of whom are carried over from the WWI trilogy, from different social classes and different parts of the alternate world (among my favorites are Lucien Galtier, a farmer in what is now the free repubic of Quebec and the delightfully revengeful South Carolinian Anne Colleton, who's lost her plantation to an uprising by black communists in the previous trilogy and now schemes with a crackpot facist, Jake Featherston, to gain power). Most of the characters are fictional, although Upton Sinclair appears here as a Socialist candidate for president of the USA and, in the most interesting flight of his imagination, the author imagines General Custer had never met up with disaster at Little Big Horn and has survived until the 1920s, where he is engaged in fighting terrorism in USA-occupied Anglophone Canada at the age of 80.<br /><br />Those are the plusses. As for the minuses, well--Mr. Turtledove just can't do sex and he really shouldn't bother (just put in three dots when the hot stuff starts and move right along please) and while he tries to be helpful to the reader, reminding who this particular character is (and some of them reappear only 80 pages apart), we do not need to be told that Custer's adjutant is overweight every time he puts in an appearance, nor that Boston factory-worker Sylvia Enos paints red rings on yellow galoshes. Then, too, while the problems the author poses are often fascinating, his solutions are sometimes too simple (a criminal case is made to disappear with amazing ease).<br /><br />Fans of alt. hist. in general, and fans of Mr. Turtledove are unlikely to be deterred by these minor annoyances, however.on yellow galoshes.

When Niki develops a mysterious infection in the palm of her hand, it triggers the beginning of her long strange journey that leads her eventually back to Another Place, where Spyder Baxter, presumed dead at the end of \\"Silk,\\" lives on.<br /><br />The tale, which crosscuts among the characters, and across this world and the other-place, mixing the mundane world of hotels and airport lounges with the goth world of bridges made of bones, is full of literary, psychoanalytic, and scientific references and downhills recklessly, painfully to a thrillingly ambiguous conclusion. Was it real? Was it a dream? Whose dream? In the end, it hardly matters. The point is, you'll probably be gasping for breath. I would very much suppose that is Ms. Kiernan's hope.	2004-10-15

No opinion is therefore offered here as to how this book compares with others in the series.<br /><br />At any rate, the tale told here, and told quite well indeed (the Native American mythology sprinkled throughout is likely to intrigue you as much as the story itself), is the touching tragedy of one of Newford's beloved artists, Jilly Coppercorn,  who's been wounded in a hit and run accident and is trying to recover (she refers to herself as the \\"broken girl\\" although she's apparently in early middle age at the time of the story).<br /><br />As she lies in bed in the \\"real world\\" in her dream time she adventures in the fairytale-ish \\"Otherworld.\\" (The constantly shifting points of view, and changes from first-person to third-person narrative only serve to heighten the sense of dislocation.) Jilly is known best for her fairie paintings and someone breaks into her studio while she's recovering from the accident and vandalizes them. Her friends, one of whom's a police lieutenant, try to find out who that person is, and whether it's the same person who ran her down.<br /><br />The most memorable character, however, turns out to be Raylene Carter, who tells her story in the first person with a white trash dialect she uses to her advantage. A victim of child abuse (a subject that clearly concerns Mr. De Lint, as it should all of us), she has left her abusive family while still a teenager and seems to have spent most of the time after her departure to trying to get even. And then she finds her way into the Otherworld too. And then things really start getting interesting.<br /><br />You'll probably care a lot for Jilly and her supportive friends (we should all be as lucky as she is) and Raylene and her accomplice Pinky Miller; and the minor characters are well drawn too: Toby, Lucinda, the Tattersnake, and even those \\"crow girls\\" who turn up for a cameo at the end, and provide a bit of fun, at a time when it's needed, both for Jilly's sake and ours.<br /><br />Since the book's origins are North American, with its tradition of serious fiction being one thing and genre fiction quite another, it's assigned to the genre category and stamped \\"fantasy.\\" But: what would have happened if Mr. De Lint had pretended he was merely translating from the Portuguese the work of, say, \\"Joao Da Silva,\\" and had set the tale in an imaginary city in Brazil? Then, it probably would not have been stamped fantasy at all, but hailed as an exemplar of Latin American \\"Magic Realism.\\" It might then have been taken to be serious fiction and classified differently by those who love literary taxonomy more than reading a good novel.<br /><br />Which this is.rt getting interesting. <br /> <br />You'll probably care a lot for Jilly and her supportive friends (we should all be as lucky as she is) and Raylene and her accomplice Pinky Miller; and the minor characters are well drawn too: Toby, Lucinda, the Tattersnake, and even those \\"crow girls\\" who turn up for a cameo at the end, and provide a bit of fun, at a time when it's needed, both for Jilly's sake and ours. <br /> <br />Since the book's origins are North American, with its tradition of serious fiction being one thing and genre fiction quite another, it's assigned to the genre category and stamped \\"fantasy.\\" But: what would have happened if Mr. De Lint had pretended he was merely translating from the Portuguese the work of, say, \\"Joao Da Silva,\\" and had set the tale in an imaginary city in Brazil?

Campbell could have pubished 50 years ago.<br /><br />Her Shan Frankland, the cynical protagonist, is in charge of the usual \\"survey team\\" components--herself, marines, and some truly obsessed scientists (\\"the payload\\"), and the inevitable journalist. They they touch down near a human colony on a world that's inhabited by an alien species that lives underwater, under the protection of another, one of whom is on station looking out for the colony. His species inhabits the planet's moon.<br /><br />Splendidly done. Nicely paced. Well thought out. First of a trilogy. I'm there for the second.<br /><br />Notes and asides: At one point Shan visits the aliens on the the planet's moon, and we learn that the gravity there is even heavier than the gravity on the planet, which is heavier than earth's. So this system is really a double planet, one of which has aliens living under water. What about the tides? There ought to be major tidal issues, to say nothing of quakes.	2004-09-08

It's far from a bad read. The narrator is Benjamin Weaver, an ex-boxer who once fought as \\"The Lion of Judah.\\" He's engaged in two cases, one of which is an investigation of the murder of his own father, from whom he was estranged.<br /><br />Everyone, including his uncle who welcomes him back to the family fold as well as the people who've hired him, seems to know more about the cases than he does (they involve \\"stock jobbing,\\" which was then new on the London scene and within a year would lead to a financial collapse), but Weaver hot-headedly stumbles and bumbles along and finally the murderer is revealed.<br /><br />There's much to admire here. Mr. Liss, an academic, has done his research about the period and the first-person narrative is, as the author explains in his postscript, an attempt to re-create 18th-century cadences. His portrayal of the London of the time fascinates, with its highlife and lowlife (the gentlemen's clubs, the coffeehouses where the traders did their business, the theatres, and the lowlife pubs that sold cheap gin to their louche patrons). Of interest as well is the description of the living conditions of the Jews. They were mostly of Iberian origin and constituted a nation within a nation.<br /><br />Unfortunately (and in all fairness this was the author's first novel; a sequel has recently seen the light of day) Mr. Liss is far from expert at plotting. He simply has Weaver visiting and revisiting the same people time and again, each time prying out a little bit more of the truth. And maybe the wrapping things up explanation at the end, written in all seriousness, will remind you far too much of Hitchcock's tongue-in-cheek, tacked on \\"psychiatrist\\" scene in \\"Psycho,\\" and that's unfortunate.<br /><br />In the acknowledgments the authors tips his hat to various academic departments who have given him support, including financial support. And the book comes equipped with the full \\"serious lit\\" attachments--a historical note; an interview with the author; the usual unintentionally barmy reader's guide questions. But at the end of the day, \\"Conspiracy of Paper\\" is just another hardboiled detective novel. That's hardly a dishonorable achievement, but there are many authors, experienced in the genre, who do this sort of thing far better, and they do it without academic funding and without the \\"A New York Times Notable Book\\" banner on the front cover.<br /><br />3.5 stars, really.to various academic departments who have given him support, including financial support.

Of course most of the time our reply is likely to be &quot;as if!&quot; Not this time. China Mieville's daring book makes the cut.<br /><br /> It's a long intricate novel whose main character is really the city of New Crobuzon itself. It's located on a world, Bas Lag, not quite earth (its moon has two small moons of its own) in a universe not quite this one. Then, imagine a late Victorian London where Babbage had actually built his analytical engines before running out of funds, and imagine it with magic as an academic discipline. And then, too, imagine it plagued with horrific creatures out of Lovecraft, plus a population of what Mr. Mieville calls &quot;Xenians.&quot; Among these are sentient creatures with insectile heads and human bodies (the khepri), and human-bird hybrids that can fly, the garuda.<br /><br /> Dickens, Steam Punk, Samuel Delany's &quot;Dhalgren,&quot; Poe, and Cordwainer Smith's &quot;Alpha Ralpha Boulevard: All come to mind. And the alien creatures may well remind you of the tales of Jack Vance or (for a newer comparison) Julie Czerneda. But it's probably unfair to keep making these comparisons. Mr. Mieville (not quite 30 when the book was first published) has his own unique vision. At times funny, at times horrific, at times political, at times philosophical, the book is as complicated as the physique of the villain Mr. Motley or the mind of the hero Isaac Grimnebulin. To say more would be to spoil the enjoyment.<br /><br /> Notes and asides: New Yorkers, natives and visitors, should ponder reading a chapter or two by the statue on the grounds of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine at Amsterdam Avenue and 112th St., just south of the building itself.	2004-07-22

Kristine Smith, smart and sophisticated (she throws in quotes from John Donne) has been a great writer since her debut novel, &quot;Code of Conduct,&quot; and she's improved each time out. In &quot;Contact Imminent,&quot; she's conquered her one weakness--plotting. In the past I got the feeling sometimes Ms. Smith confused even herself, but not this time. Things just hum along (the climax is a masterpiece of cross-cutting action that's positively cinematic) as Jani, the hybrid human-idomeni, is sent on an intricate mission, in the course of which she finds a club that would want to have her as a member--and it's one she actually wishes to join, too.<br />The members of her mob are all back--the Shakespeare-quoting Naill, the semi-smarmy Lucien, her doctor chum John who hybridized her in order to save her life, the crafty idomeni leader Tsecha. They're always true to Jani in their fashion--for the most part anyhow, as for the most part they all have their own agendas.<br />And then Ms. Smith introduces a new character, the terrorist Micah Faber; and through his character she speculates on the idea of virtual reality via hypnosis: a fascinating concept.<br />As with the previous novels this one is complete in itself. There are no cliffhanger endings. It's clear Ms. Smith has plans for more books in the series, but they'll come at her own pace. At the back of the paperback edition you will not find a preview first chapter of the next book in the series, which in some sense is a blessing although you'll probably grab the next one as soon as it appears.<br />Notes and asides: Naill refers to MacBeth as &quot;The Scottish Play&quot; because actors consider it to be bad luck to speak the play's true name. One would suppose that Ms. Smith has made Chicago the capital of her &quot;Commonwealth&quot; because she lives in Northern Illinois, as her biography makes perfectly clear.	2004-06-26

Catherine Asaro's \\"The Moon's Shadow\\" is the final volume of a quartet within her fabulous Skolian Empire series that tells of the events in the aftermath of the Radiance War. (Newcomers are advised to read \\"Primary Inversion\\" and \\"The Radiant Seas\\" first.) While the first of these, \\"Ascendant Sun,\\" was a classic space opera, in \\"The Quantum Rose\\" Asaro riffed on the once-high-tech world gone medieval theme, while \\"Spherical Harmonic\\" can perhaps best be described as a resurrection myth containing a quantum physics monograph (or perhaps the other way around).<br />And now in \\"Shadow,\\" one of the best of the entire series, the author returns to her romantic side--plenty of sex, plenty of space opera. Above all, though, it's a novel of manners. The red-eyed Eubian \\"Highton\\" aristocracy speak with indirection and false politeness. The biggest faux pas one of them can make is to say exactly what they mean. And suddenly among them comes their naive and reluctant new young emperor, Jabriol III, who has to grow up and take charge in a hurry (a typical Asaro theme), dealing with potential assassins and dubious allies, all the while trying to start peace negotiations with the Skolians (he's half Skolian himself); more important, all the while trying to figure out what's going on. A tall and complicated order indeed.<br />Most delicious of all, though, readers are reintroduced to perhaps the most complex character Asaro has ever created, the Eubian finance minister Tarquine Iquar (who fans of the series will remember from \\"Ascendant Sun\\"). She's smart, she's tough, she's conflicted. For the second time in the series she appears on the book cover. Despite her age (which of course she doesn't look a bit of), she's not too old to do some growing up and taking charge herself. She knows the language of indirection, and she redirects it her way. She has plenty of secrets of her own. Will she reveal them? Indeed, dear reader, that is for you to discover.	2004-05-29

You'll quickly realize that nothing is at it seems--you know surprises are coming, and maybe you'll try to anticipate the author's deviousness. And since the author lays the clues right out for you, it can be done (but not easily), so when the secret is revealed it's usually a forehead-slapping moment, when you realize you should indeed have seen it coming.<br />This time out, the quadriplegic Rhyme and his &quot;walk-the-grid&quot; colleague, Amelia Sachs (as spectacularly neurotic as ever) are involved with the underworld of illegal Chinese immigration. They have to fight not only the perpetrators, but possibly a mole among the various organizations--NYPD, FBI, INS, Coast Guard, U.S. State Department, the Chinese government--involved in the case. Since the book is part of a series, you know the good guys will win, but how? That's where the thrills are.<br />Notes and asides: on p. 282 the term NYFD is mentioned. Sorry. It's NYPD but FDNY. Mr. Deaver, familiar as he is with things NYC, must know that. Somewhere in Outsourceiana (Indiana? Idaho? Iowa? India?) is a copyeditor who thinks &quot;wow! I saved Jeffery Deaver from an obvious error.&quot; Err, no.	2004-05-23

She sets out to try to learn who has freed the villainous schemer and traitor (and Phedre's nemesis) Melisande Shahrizai. Using her subtle skills, which lead her to an alt-Venice, she does. But that's only halfway through the book. The rest of it, dealing with Phedre's new problem, how to spread the word of what she has learned, pelts to a suspenseful and clever conclusion as Phedre embarks on a tour of this carefully created alt-renaissance Europe in hopes of thwarting a plot against her queen.<br />Ms. Carey's readers will be doubtless delighted to learn that she herself has thwarted the peril of the mid-book-in-the-trilogy blahs. \\"Chosen\\" is no mere scene-setter for the finale. In fact, in some sense it appears to be the equivalent of a side quest in a computer adventure game. The payoff's still to come, but you'll have a grand time on this journey, which takes unexpected turns at the slightest opportunity.<br />Again, as in the first book, \\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" the author uses the first-person technique, and she never cheats. Everything that happens (and plenty does) is related through Phedre's eyes only, despite the huge cast of characters. Ms. Carey never stoops to the \\"trick\\" of having a character recite verbatim to Phedre dialog she herself has not heard. (For example: Phedre only hears, but doesn't actually see, the climax of an epic duel.) Parts of the book are near-operatic (when a pirate captain who's come to Phedre's aid has completed his task he virtually bows out), and parts slyly humorous, and the fantastic elements are subtle indeed.<br />It's an amazing accomplishment.	2004-05-05

The book is two stories in one, and the one set on Mingulay gets 4 stars. Mr. McLeod's description of a colonized world inhabited by humans and \\"saurs\\" (they get drunk and stoned together) and the briefly mentioned two other hominid species (imagine what dinosaurs might have evolved into had they had the chance), with traders from the stars passing through and the world's tech wearing out is fascinating  (although you may feel that the romantic attachments Gregor Cairns goes through are solved rather smoothly). This part of the book is told in the odd-numbered chapters.<br />Unfortunately the other story, told in, of course, the even-numbered chapters and narrated for the most part by Gregor's ancestor Matt, is a rehashing of Heinlein--and not done especially well (think \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\" with cyberpunks and Deadheads instead of Libertarians and you sort of get the point). The author's notion that a resurgent Russia will gain control over the EU (something called an \\"oil war\\" is hinted at) is, to be charitable, bizarre; his economic theories aren't worth discussing; the by the numbers \\"up against the wall bureaucrats!\\" plotting is something we've all seen before, and done far more coherently.<br />First of a trilogy.	2004-04-06

Kiernan's third, and best novel yet. This time out she brings back many of the Southern Gothic Birmingham characters from her previous novels and introduces them to an escapee from Lovecraft country, serial killer and psychotic Narcissa Snow. She wants to please and appease folks you would definitely not want to invite to your place.<br />But Narcissa, arrested adolescent that she is, wants to be in with this ghoulish in crowd (they apparently are headquartered in a strange house in Providence) and so she sets off Southward to Birmingham on a killing spree (all the while listening in her head to the voices of the people she killed), and an attempt to steal the baby of eight-month-pregnant Chance, from &quot;Threshold,&quot; who's now married to recovering alcoholic Deacon Silvey. Narcissa wants to give the baby over to the in crowd as a ticket of admission. After many surprises, the chilling finale takes place back north in Lovecraft country as the sun sets and that low red moon rises on Halloween Night, 2001 a night when, as Ms. Kiernan assures us in her note in the front, the moon actually was full.<br />The author expertly blends standard slasheriana (Don't go out for a cigarette, Alice! Why isn't there a police car at the rear entrance? Will you just hear the guy out before punching him in the nose, Deacon? A dark and stormy night? Oh oh!) with her own unique visions and her intoxicating prose style (she writes of &quot;old-fashioned lampposts along the street, gaslights with electric hearts&quot;) and brews up something rich and strange, fresh and piquant. She knows the concoction calls for certain required elements, but her garnishments are what make the difference. Its flavor will leave you spellbound.<br />Notes and asides: On p. 18 you'll learn why Ms. Kiernan has abandoned her trademark technique of running words together. The Low Red Moon, occurring as it does on the last day of the month, was also a blue moon. Not for children under 13.th, was also a blue moon. Not for children under 13.	2004-03-07

This time out she takes her readers on a tour of the Silk Road states of Central Asia (and apparently that's a part of the world Williams is familiar with), ending up in Uzbekistan, in the ancient city of Samarkand.<br />Elena, now cleaning offices in Almaty, Kazakhistan, was once a scientist in the Soviet space program. After acquiring a strange metallic object she hooks up with Ilya, an 800-year-old \\"Bogatyr\\" (once a hero of Russia, now a junkie), and together they attempt to solve the object's mystery.<br />That in turn leads them to a parallel world, and then things really start to hum, as they encounter many strange and nefarious characters while they shuttle between this world and the parallel one, in which the Soviet Union didn't exactly die.<br />Williams is a playful author with a great sense of place. She makes the decay and despair of the former Soviet Republics seem very real--the rundown busses, the abandoned space facilities, the failed attempts to construct subways. And yet, this mock heroic quest is slightly tongue in cheek. Think of it as Elena and Ilya in Wonderland and you'll half get the point. And, as with the Carroll classic, the journey's far more important than the destination.<br />Until now, Williams hasn't done sequels (and an advert in the back of the book would indicate that her next novel will surely not be one), but she's left a few loose ends here (and she's far too clever to have done so by accident), so maybe some day a sequel there will be.<br />We can only hope.	2004-02-25

Her knee still hurts.<br />And then people start shooting at her and her colleagues, a group of Idomeni start to act more \\"humanish,\\" and, oh yeah, her parents show up.<br />Our Jani of course continues to kick butt and take names; there's plenty of plot confusion (even Jani, as usual, doesn't quite know what's going on); There's a confrontation in, of all places, a bureaucratic meeting, and maybe the next time you're stuck in one at your job, you may have some delicious fantasies, thinking \\"oh if only Jani Kilian were here now!\\"<br />Great writing, great fun.

Smith's first offering, &quot;Code of Conduct,&quot; showed promise: it was brilliantly written although confusing and overly flashbacky. This one is even better written, if that's possible, and not at all flashbacky.<br />At the end of the first book Jani, the cat-eyed &quot;augmented&quot; hybridized (against her will) military document examiner who once apparently killed her commanding officer during a civil war among the alien Idomeni (some of whose DNA she now carries) seemed to have got clean away after solving a murder mystery. But in this tale she quickly gets pulled back in, and the next thing she knows she's up to her neck in diplomatic negotiations, while her body enhancements are failing (fix the chick's knee and get her a new liver--STAT).<br />Smith's plotting is delightfully over the top although confusing, and maybe she's done that on purpose. She obviously wants to focus attention on Jani and her mob (a few chapters are told from viewpoints other than Jani's) while the diplomatic events, having to do with delicate human-Idomeni negotiations, are kept murkily in the background. And so what I took, in the first book, to be &quot;first novel&quot; faults may in fact be deliberate. No doubt more shall be revealed in the author's next volume (the third of four), &quot;Law of Survival.&quot; I look forward to it.	2003-12-10

But no. The author instead is determined to hit us over the head with his naive and sentimental political screeds and his increasingly interminable prose. The book would have been twice as effective at half the length. The author bombards us pretty much the way the Islamic foces bombard mountains in the bizarre and thoroughly (needlessly) confusing trench warfare segment. But for what purpose?

America is apparently still part of the Empire).<br />With its fantastic mixture of the gothic, noir police procedural, alternate history, time travel, literary parody, and an uncle who's the maddest of scientists, things rush along at a rapid, often hilarious pace. There's a loose end, which is apparently left to be resolved in the sequel.<br />Enjoy.<br />Notes and asides: a blurb on the back cover describes Thursday Next as &quot;part Bridget Jones, part Nancy Drew, and part Dirty Harry.&quot; Err, no.	2003-10-29

It starts out as a near-future medical thriller, but quickly takes an unexpected turn, because thankfully Mitchell's more interested in showing the relationship between real viruses and computer viruses than she is in writing yet another tale about How They Isolated the Virus and Saved the Planet.<br />And so, in this tale the vaccine is found rather early on in the novel, after which Mitchell turns her attention to what happens next. Most people demand the virus, of course, while a small percentage do not, because they like the body modifications the disease can cause (one character wants wings). As for the victims themselves, they're simply quarantined.<br />There are three main characters: Mitchell's hacker character, Idaho (he wires himself into the net and feeds himself via IV while on line), quickly sees how he can turn his skills from altering the virtual world to altering the real one, by manipulating DNA. He realizes that by doing so he can modify people and he goes about doing just that. The other two protagonists are Lillith, a health worker (she's a save the world type who still wants to keep her day job) who tries to help solve the mystery of the plague while aiding the victims, and Geoffrey, the rich young man who's inadvertently started the whole while looking for a cure for his own cystic fibrosis.<br />As in &quot;Murphy's Gambit&quot; and &quot;Techogenisis,&quot; Mitchell creates interesting characters who don't always make the right decisions. You'll probably find yourself caring about them (one especially effective scene is when Geoffrey, who is kept in quarantine as the &quot;patient zero&quot; of the plague, is transferred to a quarantine facility for other victims--it's his old family estate). Mitchell keeps things moving along briskly and efficiently and the book reaches a satisifying and logical conclusion, with room for a sequel although one isn't inevitable. She also raises some ethical issues that are definitely worth pondering.She also raises some ethical issues that are definitely worth pondering.	2003-10-21

You may find yourself using up your entire annual quota of suspension of disbelief on this one: In Mr. Daniel's construction, the planets of the inner system are tied together by nanotech cables (who would do that? why? how could it be made affordable?), the AIs (they serve as the Group Against Whom There Is Predjudice) can have biological children (wait for it!), and the sentient cloudships debate endlessly out there by the Oort Cloud (skim those parts!). The book's far too long though. It seems as if the author doesn't really yet know how the war, just begun here, is going to turn out, and maybe he even lost interest half the way through and simply decided to concentrate on the characters he created and figure it all out later. Not a bad thing, actually, but clearly Mr. Daniel sent &quot;Metaplanetary&quot; out to warm us up for the main act, and that's apparently still in the dressing room.<br />Notes and asides: For all the far-out science here, Mr. Daniel seems to lack basic knowledge of astronomy. From page 464: &quot;the sun set in the west, and a crescent moon rose in the sky. Venus burned near the moon's arms.&quot; Oh really?	2003-09-28

Unfortunately it's supposed to be a fiction book. The science, anyhow, is certainly fascinating. Radio waves beamed back to the past; \\"quark nuggets\\"; \\"vacuum decay\\"; multiple evolving universes--all real, according to the author's afterword, and all quite challenging.<br />And there's this loopy probability puzzle known as the Carter Catastrophe here. It, too, is real, says Mr. Baxter. But then, so is Zeno's Paradox. I wouldn't get worked up about Carter, although the characters in the book certainly do.<br />That's because the author wants them to get worked up. Mr. Baxter, like Woody Allen in one of his films, is apparently in a funk because the universe is expanding and will eventually wither away by heat death. So why bother? Especially since, well, Mr. Baxter, despite all the fascinating theories about evolving universes, seems to believe we're pretty much alone here--against all odds.<br />And because a few billion more years of evolution, alone, don't quite do it for our Mr. Baxter, he's concocted a truly hashed up plot, filled with stock characters from a Heinlein parody. (His Reid Malenfant is just a pale copy of an RAH \\"grand old man\\"; his colleage, Cornelius, keeps bringing what plot there is to a screeching halt in order to deliver his science lessons. You may actually welcome those intrusions.) The simple folk go absolutely bananas worrying about this catastrophe while Malenfant, who at one point discovers he _is_ the center of things and hurls an invective at Copernicus, manages to take a grand tour of the manifold of universes--it ends up somehow in a virtual hotel room (don't ask!).<br />And then there are the \\"blue children\\"--annoying, brilliant but autistic, mini-Howard Roarks, whose grand scheme is to blow everything up in order to make the evolution of universes more efficient and woe to anyone and anything that impedes them from their appointed rounds. The two characters sympathetic to the children are a Congresswoman and Malanfant's ex-wife. Everybody else wants to delete them with extreme prejudice to prevent them from creating their new order, and after a while some readers may well feel the same way.<br />Others, however, may find this creation of a new order fascinating and necessary. Still others--those of us content simply to have life-as-we-know it hang on here for a few billion more years or so--may find that Mr. Baxter's scenario is, well, fascinatingly fascist.<br />Oh, lest I forget: also appearing here are intelligent space-faring squids. Feisty critters they are too. I rather liked 'em whenever they turned up. They're the meek, who inherit the earth, but by then it isn't worth very much.the children are a Congresswoman and Malanfant's ex-wife.

In this complex novel author Iain Pears skillfully weaves together three connected stories, each of which is set during a time civilization was in a state of collapse: the last days of the Roman Empire in the West; the plague year 1348; France during the German occupation in World War II. All three stories are set in Avignon (in 1310 the Papacy moved to that city because of disorder in Rome and would remain there until 1378) and the surrounding Provencal countryside.<br />The thread running through the three stories, all of which deal with moral dilemmas posed by an oncoming collapse, is the title of the book, a manuscript entitled &quot;The Dream of Scipio,&quot; written by a fifth-century Roman, Manlius, who converts to Christianity in order to try to preserve what is left of the Western Roman Empire. The manuscript is discovered by Olivier de Noyen, poet, scholar, aide to a powerful Cardinal, in 1348, and rediscovered in 20th-century France by intellectual Julien Barneuve.<br />In each of the stories the protagonists are faced with moral choices--must a few be sacrificed to save the many? And it's left to the reader to determine whether they've made the right choices or not. Pears, with his deadpan prose, offers no opinion.<br />The tale is a chilly one. (Some may put the book down and select another after reading the opening sentence.) And if you stick with it you'll probably be consulting reference books to read up on the history of the periods Pears writes about (he helpfully supplies a timeline).<br />Pears makes no missteps. He accomplishes what he sets out to do, but when you've finished it you'll probably want to run outside and take a walk in the sunshine.	2003-08-31

Modesitt, master of the plain tale plainly told, opts for something more complicated--an intricate five-voices point of view (a singer, a reporter, a cop, a politician, and a businessman), and a tangled plot line. He resolves everything nicely, as the five protagonists, who don't know each other when the book begins, converge by the end.<br />While the book is set in the 25th century, it has more of a near-future feel (change the Martian Republic to some rogue state on earth and it's likely the technology described is no more than a generation or two away). People communicate instantly via &quot;linking&quot;; fabricated food is fabricated in &quot;formulators&quot;; cars are electric.<br />And the author doesn't relish the future he imagines--one in which &quot;resonance&quot; enhances music, and maybe manipulates minds as well. In short, it's a world without beauty, and this irks Mr. Modesitt more than somewhat, and he'll probably get you on his side also.<br />It's seemlessly written and fast paced. And it's less of a whodunit than it is a &quot;how will they figure it out?&quot; You know what the bad guys are up to before the good guys do and, as Alfred Hitchcock knew well, that is the kind of scenario that creates the most suspense of all.<br />Notes and asides: Sigh. Like most futuristas, Modesitt feels compelled to make reference to &quot;the holos.&quot; But since he actually describes how this tech might work instead of search and replacing &quot;movies&quot; with &quot;holos&quot; after he completed his first draft, I am not deducting any stars. The shortening of city names is disconcerting and not believable and sometime merely silly (Denv for Denver). Paris has been around a long time, and nobody's ever tried to shorten it to Pris.	2003-08-22

The characters are fascinating; the science seems plausible, and Kenyon hasn't lost her ability to do action scenes convincingly. (Some aren't for the squeamish, and definitely not for the under-13 set.)<br />What's most intriguing, however, is the way Kenyon turns the classic quest story on its head. When the humans find what they're looking for, and it's time to head home, some of them begin to think that perhaps that's not the best idea after all.<br />Read the tale; find out why.	2003-08-19

In addition to the brilliant and mysterious Lillian Dawes, whose first noncameo appearance doesn't occur until a third of the book is behind you, you'll meet the brothers Gabriel and Spencer Gibbs, who are temporarily rooming together (for reasons explained in the opening chapter), and their delightful aunt Lavinia, who brings her own silverware, and her dog, to restaurants.<br />The story is written in the first person, by Gabriel at some point in his future, and it joins the ever-growing list of \\"New York\\" novels, and quite near the top, too. Comparisons with \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" as well as Henry James and Edith Wharton are inevitable.

Well, it's a pleasure alright (the plot twists surprise, the characters are hard to forget, the prose is elegant), but when you close the book 901 pages later, you probably won't feel guilty at all. You may even want to applaud.<br />The setting is an alternate early-Renaissance Europe (France is called \\"Terre d'Ange\\"), in which early Christianity has taken an odd turn and for some reason there are three islands (as the helpful map shows) in the English Channel called \\"the three sisters.\\" (It takes a while before you learn what they are, and what their significance is, but it's worth the wait.)<br />Phedre, bisexual courtesan-avid reader-linguist-slave-spy is thrown by fate into a grand tour of this world and she helps to right some wrongs along the way--and rather cleverly at that; her methods are never out of character.<br />And then there's the style: Quite daringly, Carey has Phedre tell her long tale in a first-person narrative. And that's a difficult thing to do. Authors less skilled than Carey who use the first person to describe a \\"built\\" world often resort to conventions to disguise the fact that the narrator, there in the built world, is writing for you, here in the early 21st century (\\"I have heard that in some worlds there are strange beasts upon whose backs people ride\\"). But Carey avoids this convention entirely. Phedre's narrative simply assumes that you are part of her world and that you've picked up her narrative some time in _her_ future (not ours), and as a result everything is left shimmery, impressionistic, as foggy as John Jude Palencar's amazing cover. It may take you a while before you slap your forehead and think, \\"oh yes. Now I see what those 13 houses of the night court are!\\"<br />A stunning novel, superior in every way.

This is perfectly appropriate because Flyer himself eventually becomes such a heroic figure himself, working as a spy for the OSS during World War II, when he's not becoming a tycoon, inventing a paint-mixing machine, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, dabbling in Ancient Egyptian mysticism, or looking for a mysterious woman in a photograph--all the while keeping a firm hold on his yellow fedora (yes, that fedora--the one on the front cover).<br />Christopher's fast-paced tongue-in-cheek homage to the genre is 180 degrees from his previous novel, the long, languid, \\"A Trip to the Stars,\\" and maybe it doesn't measure up to that masterpiece.<br />But it's definitely a fun, provocative read, and it will keep you out of mischief for a couple of days.	2003-07-05

So: the no fun crowd blows up accordianist Soledad McCrae's \\"cruce\\" in Latin America with her lover and all her fun crowd friends and the next thing you know she's in the Bay Area mutely hanging with another fun crowd (and oh oh, tossing her cookies in the morning, uhuh, uhuh) and the no fun crowd is after _them_ too, and the flashbacks are told in the present sense and the present-time events are told in the past tense and Soledad is so _not_ fun herself that you really want to slap her, and there are a lot of Spanish words and so every tenth word is in italics and there's all this arcane musicology stuff.<br />But this is cyberpunk, so there are also lots of product references and the fun crowd are all heroes and the no fun crowd are fascists, and there's this performance art machine that keeps smashing the carcass of a dead horse against the wall and Doris Lessing likes it and on the back cover compares Foy to Conrad (you cannot make this stuff up) and another blurb mentions Hemingway.<br />So I guess this is for graduate students in English or American studies who want to deconstruct science fiction.

Twenty-something in the early 1980s, George is narrating the book from the perspective of the turn of the century but he is writing about events during the summer New York's least-loved skyscraper, the Pan Am Building, was sold and became the Met Life building. George observes: \\"we were the last generation of the century to come of age, and the first one that wanted to be as much like our parents' as possible. We ought to have started a revolution; instead we bought cocktail shakers.\\"<br />Macy, in a manner Jane Austen and Edith Wharton might well have admired, has George describe the adventures of the slim ash blonde Dartmouth graduate (she's two years older than he is) Kate Goodnow. Her family is old money and book centers around who she will marry. Fellow grad Chat Weathers, the \\"not our kind\\" software entrepreneur Harry Lombardi (he has a mobile phone when they're still considered geeky and the era's so _not_ Internet ready computers display green pixels on a dark grey screen), or neo-hippie Nick Beale, who spends his time sailing.<br />For Kate (and Macy makes you keep wondering why any of these men would desire her to the point of nervous breakdown) courtship is merely another game to be played. She is, we learn, determined to be the first in her set to get married, and so she sets about doing just that.<br />Comparisons with &quot;Gatsby&quot; are inevitable, of course, but I think that's reaching too high. However, Macy may well be tipping her hat to a contemporary of Fitzgerald when narrator George tells us that one of the characters wants to bring back the old phone exchanges like \\"PLaza 5 and MUrray Hill 4.\\"<br />To say nothing of Butterfield 8?<br />But no matter. Macy's touch is assured (maybe you'll have difficulty believing this is her first novel or that she's as young as she looks in her photograph). The book needs no such comparisons at all. Macy has mastered the elements of style: &quot;The Fundamentals of Play&quot; reads as if Macy dipped a stiletto in hydrofluoric acid and etched her words on a glass plate.	2003-06-13

It tells the story of Rue Cassells, who discovers an interstellar object that turns out to be an abandoned alien artifact, and her friend and onetime lover Michael Bequith, an assistant to a truly nutty professor, who comes along for the ride.<br />The tale is jagged, confusing, jumbled. Its characters do what they do because Mr. Schroeder wants them to, not from any sort of internal motivation--at least none discernible to me. The science is dippy: tool-making species, intones Michael's boss, Professor Herat, in a plot stopping interlude, are doomed because their tool making is a compensation for their failure to adopt to their environment (duh).  There's FTL, but it doesn't work everywhere and not everybody has it (but they all want it), but everybody bops around free of the problems of time dilation, etc. etc. (eh?).<br />There's a villain, of course, Admiral Crisler, who used to be a scientist (oh please!) and he does everything but twirl his cape and go bwaa haa haa. (Anyone? Anyone? Whiplash? Whiplash?)<br />You'll probably stay till the end; there's some good space opera here and the final invasion of Crisler's domain is well-done. But maybe you'll feel exhausted rather than elated when you reach the final page.<br />This book is so unfocused (especially compared with the author's debut novel) that you may wonder how it came to be. I have an idea. I think that Mr. Schroeder's editor asked him if he had anything else in the pipeline post-\\"Ventus.\\" Voila! Mr. Schroeder pulled this out of his drawer (or out of his computer?) and the editor set to work trying to make something coherent of it. But there was just no way.<br />Ah well, maybe next time Mr. Schroeder will deliver a winner. For sure he's capable of it.	2003-06-10

The first half of Ian McEwen's stately \\"Atonement\\" takes place in 1935 (it's merely entitled Part 1 and it takes up 174 of the book's 351 pages). It's a conventional English novel of manners that will lure in fans of Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, and Henry Green. In its numbered chapters, McEwan describes, using multiple points of view, how the 13-year-old Briony, a borderline sociopath possessed of a writer's imagination, sees her older sister Cecilia (called Cee) and her friend Robbie (he's a gardener who's been to Cambridge and wants to be a doctor) in what might be considered a compromising position, misinterprets what she sees (almost certainly deliberately), and finds that her actions have consequences, her lies believed.<br />Then, just as Beethoven suddenly, daringly tosses singers into what has been up to then a conventional classical symphony, the rest of the book goes off in unexpected directions, as we learn in parts 2 and 3 (each about half as long as part 1) what happens to Cee, Briony, and Robbie in the epochal year of 1940, during the British army's evacuation of Dunkirk and the German bombing of London.<br />These sections, we learn, are written by the imaginative Briony perhaps in an attempt to atone for her misinterpretation of events, or perhaps merely to prove to herself that she's an author worthy of being published. Or perhaps both. (Briony's grande geste, giving up her own chance to go to Cambridge to work as a nurse in a hospital is perhaps an over-dramatically way to atone.) One thing is certain: after the classical nature of the first part, the events here, not divided by chapters, tumble along almost out of control as they describe the horrors of war and then the horrors of the wounded as they are taken to hospitals.<br />Finally, in an eleagic (and more than somewhat self-serving) coda, dated 1999 and told in the first person by Briony, now 77 and near the end of her life, we get still another interpretation of events.<br />The prose is elegant; the emotions are raw. And in the end you'll wonder whether there's been any atonement at all. You may even wonder if it matters.<br />The book has an ice-cold crystalline clarity that resonates.

And the United States--err, make that Columbia--was settled by the English and the Dutch and its territory consists of much of our universe's United States and Anglophone Canada. The Mormons, however, seem to have settled in their own land called Deseret. Huh? (Alt-hist purists may be upset, more than somewhat, to discover that Mr. Modesitt provides no turning point event to account for the divergence between this time line and our own, but the rest of us won't care all that much.)<br />Eshbach, environmental economist and sometime spy and his diva wife, Llysette, are sent, at government expense, to St. Petersburg where she will perform before the Czar, while Eschbach himself must negotiate some sort of oil deal with the Russians so that the Austro-Hungarians don't corner the world's oil supply, and of course there are plenty of bad guys around that do not wish for Eschbach to succeed. (Naturally, like any secret agent who has to save the world, he comes equipped with a few special gadgets that tilt the odds in his favor--and usually not a moment too soon at that.)<br />The book is smoothly written, urbane, and just plain fun.

Unlike the \\"Alice\\" stories, however, Winnie is less mentally competent (and far less likable) than Lewis Carroll's practical little girl, while the professor of medieval history, the spiritualist, the dotty old lady, and the woman who casts children's hands for a living are clever for the most part, and more than somewhat sympathetic. And, if this weren't enough, the place is quite possibly haunted. And the ghost is possibly Jack the Ripper's.<br />Well now!<br />Author Gregory Maguire, best-known for his clever \\"Wicked,\\" a re-write of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" told from the witch's point of view, ventures forth here without a safety net, concocting a story that's all his own. Without the constraints of having to hew to the plot lines of a tale familiar to us all (he couldn't have let the witch survive, now could he?) this time out Maguire creates something that's all his. And in doing so he manages to make what at first seems hauntingly terrifying in the end quite explicable, if no less disturbing. It frightens, but maybe not in the way you'd expect.<br />Notes and asides: The cover design and illustrations by Douglas Smith are stunning. Yes, this edition comes complete with the now apparently obligatory reader's group questions (\\"in what way is fantasy a distraction from the real world?\\").

Egan playfully sets the tale in \\"199_,\\" but the dash could be only 7 or 8 or 9. As clearly the setting is the time of the Great Age of Dotcoms--so  _not_ this era.<br />The older Charlotte is a 28-year-old-beauty (or anyway was before her face gets redone) who admits to having been born 35 years before the story takes place. She's a far from super fashion model who makes the playoffs but never gets to the final round (what she calls her \\"mirrored room\\") has her face repaired in Rockford (it now sports 80 titanium screws), her home town, and then returns to New York--to find nobody recognizes her anymore.<br />The younger Charlotte, 16, the daughter of the older Charlotte's high school friend, is an unconventionally troubled teen with an attitude, a brother who's being treated for leukemia, and a dotty uncle.<br />Also making an appearance are an alcoholic private detective and the mysterious Z, terrorist-math teacher, whose life takes a dramatic turn after he dines at a Micky D's.<br />Egan skillfully interweaves the story lines and creates some hilarious moments--among them a fashion photographer who finds a creative use for razors, perhaps the most bizarre attempted suicide in recent American literature, a reference to a tv documentary about the making of a \\"making of\\" movie, and a climactic attempt to re-create on film what is now Charlotte's (in)famous auto accident for an Internet Website, to which she has sold her very identity.<br />In an afterword, Egan mentions that she wrote the book between 1994 and 2001. So what seems like remembrance and reflection is actually prescience and prediction. It's quite an achievement.	2003-03-20

Wentworth's fast-paced (and beautifully written) \\"Stars over Stars\\" has to be one of the weirdest, and yet most fascinating, contributions to the \\"military\\" science-fiction subgenre.<br />A sequel to \\"Black on Black,\\" it contains a veritable cornucopia of whacked out humans and aliens.  The fun starts before you even open the book. Look at Patrick Turner's brilliant cover, which shows a wolf-like biped (Wentworth describes the critters as wolf-bear-cat combos, but never mind), clearly male, looking over his shoulder at a tiny human woman, who looks as if she'd rather be anywhere else than where she is (they're framed against a background of crystals--you'll soon learn why) while toting so many guns and ammo that it's unlikely she'd have a chance to use any of it before being toppled over by anything incoming. And she seems quite aware of this. \\"What am I doing here, with this big bad critter?\\" she seems to be asking. (And maybe you will be too.)<br />The lupine is Heyoka Blackeagle, a member of the race of Hrinn who have definite issues dealing with authority figures and chains of command (they're used to solving disputes the way Earth's wolves do), who serves as a sergeant in the human-led intergalactic ranger corps, and the woman is Mitsu Jensen, his corporal. Jensen has just recovered from having been brainwashed by the insectoid race known as the Flek (the story told in \\"Black on Black\\"), and the still unstable woman thinks she sees them everywhere. But they've abandoned this planet, which is now occupied by the peaceful Laka (who also seemingly have all sorts of mental problems). The possibly still-addled Jensen seems unable or unwilling to tell the difference between Laka and Flek.<br />And then, just when Heyoka and all the other members of the platoon are convinced Mitsu's brain is indeed seriously fried--yep, here come the Flek themselves.  And then things really go bananas, as the tale tumbles on in a multiple POV fashion (all the significant characters get at least one turn at bat). The details of the tumultuous efforts to keep the planet Flek-free will not be divulged here. See for yourself.<br />A great piece of work. More please!rs get at least one turn at bat).

Dedicated to Jane Austen, William Burroughs, and Jack Vance (you hardly need to have the Vance connection spelled out for you), the author cleverly weaves together speculations about a historical figure, Elizabethan alchemist-astrologer John Dee, and the fictional Alivet Dee, a distant ancestor, who works as an alchemist on a planet called &quot;Latent Emanation.&quot;<br />Plot mechanations soon throw her into the arms of the mysterious, witty poison-master Ghairen from yet another planet, Hathes, and soon Alivet is drawn up in a plot to free her world of the mysterious Lords of Night and their collaborators, the &quot;Unpriests&quot;--and more than incidentally to free her twin sister Inki.<br />She's attracted to Ghairen, but can she trust him? Williams spins out the answers cleverly, gorgeously, giddily. The byplay between Alivet and Ghairen is to treasure. Her descriptive passages are lush. Her prose dances and sparkles and the characters (unsurprisingly considering the debt to Austen) seem believable and all too human.<br />Williams just keeps getting better and better.	2003-03-04

Wetherell's look back at the early days of TV, and a time that really _was_ morning in America, keeps turning corners; and it will keep you turning pages all the way to its redemptive ending. At times clinical, at times dreamy, at times surrealistic, it will put you present at the creation of a fictionalized version of the original \\"Today\\" show, called \\"Morning\\" here. We learn early on that the host, Alec McGowan was shot dead on the air by his friend and on-air sidekick, Chet, and the rest of the book delves into the hows and whys.<br />The structure is clever is a Rosebuddy kind of way. In 2000 Chet's estranged son is writing a biography of the slain host, who was shot in 1954, and is at the same time caring for the terminally ill Chet, who's been released from his life imprisonment so that he can die in freedom, and the tale zigzags back and forth between two stories, set a half-century apart.<br />McGowan is based in large part on the original \\"Today\\" show host, Dave Garroway (he too wore double breasted suits and bowties, he had a chimp as a cast member, and he signed off with a raised palm). Garroway's end was not a violent one, though (he died in retirement) and his show, like the fictional one created here, was probably the first that actually used the potential of the new TV medium. \\"Today,\\" like the fictionalized \\"Morning,\\" was something fresh and new--it wasn't vaudeville, and it wasn't radio drama with visuals. It couldn't have existed before TV. And Wetherell does a superb job of reimagining  those days of the early 1950s--the people, most wearing hats, flocking to the window to watch the show as it was taking place live, waving banners and placards bearing the names of their home towns (those of a certain age are likely to slap their foreheads in astonishment, thinking about days long forgotten and then admitting, \\"yeah that's how it was\\").<br />... some readers will like this book for the re-creations of the television of an earlier day, while others will enjoy the well-told tale. And then there are those who'll like both.<br />Notes and asides: In 1950 tokens were not yet in use on the New York subway system--the fare was a dime. Automats also took coins, not tokens.

Matthews' \\"judiciary\\" series (\\"Prisoner of Conscience,\\" \\"An Exchange of Hostages,\\" \\"Hour of Judgment,\\" \\"Angel of Destruction\\"), and maybe it's the strongest, most complicated  yet.  Those who've read the previous books will probably be delighted by this one. As always Matthews' descriptive prose pulls you right in. You can almost taste the bad rations and the cramped quarters aboard a spaceship in need of supplies.<br />You'll reencounter characters from before and meet a few new ones as well (among them Andrej's wife), but newcomers to the series would be advised to read them in the order they're written. Matthews doesn't bother to back up much, which helps keep the book to reasonable length.<br />This time out Inquisitor Andrej Koscuisko gets a chance to go home to his family, and hopes to leave his position as Inquisitor. In his assignment as ship's surgeon aboard the space ship Ragnarok, he's also required to torture suspects, but now at last he's offered a way out.<br />Things of course go wrong almost immediately and we see in a series of cynical (and psychological) portraits how nearly every facet of Matthews' universe involves corruption. (It's so widespread the corrupt are described as \\"reasonable people.\\")<br />Things proceed eerily but stately, impressionistically. Nothing is quite what it seems; nothing is fully revealed. There are ancient hostilities between cultures not fully explained, or perhaps not yet. Clearly there are more novels to come in the series, and if the existing five are a guide, in each one another layer of Matthews' onion-verse will be pulled back.<br />Great concept, great execution.	2003-02-07

His Taria Spears rejects intimacy, disobeys orders, antognizes nearly everyone she meets, but . . . well, wait for it.<br />The premise is simple: a wormhole, &quot;the thunder,&quot; appears near Jupiter, and the survey team is sent through it to discover another gas-giant planet that has a life-supporting satellite upon which live the curious &quot;Blues.&quot; These critters are hopelessly myopic and their primary sense is hearing (the author does a marvellous job of depicting what a hearing-based society, language, art, and architecture might be like), but it seems unlikely they could be the ones responsible for constructing the wormhole. Taria thinks otherwise.<br />The rulebound survey team, composed primarily of military personnel (although Taria and a few others are civilians) meets virtually with blue representatives and eventually (and reluctantly) the powers that be on the survey team send Taria to the surface (for a postmodernist tale it's surprising how 1950s Farrell makes the hidebound survey-team officers--they could have been created by one of John W. Campbell's &quot;Analog&quot; mag. writers of the 1950s). Taria, of course, finds things are not what they seem, at which point the tale gets a kick start and moves on to its swift conclusion.<br />Notes and asides: Farrell anticipates certain objections readers might have and tosses in an appendix to deal with them, and you get the sense that an editor insisted upon this. With more time (and skill--this is apparently Farrell's first novel) the details listed there could have been worked into the main story. And whatever did happen to Ensign Coen?

There aren't many of them left, as they've been fighting a long war with the Lucien, who now have the few Kinley who remain blockaded on their home planet. The Lucien had used nukes, the Kinley bioterrorism and when the story opens the Lucien have the better of it, as the Kinley learn that their enemies have plans for their total annihilation.<br />But the Kinley know that they once possessed the secret of faster than light travel, and so they dispatch Pruit to run the blockade and make it to earth, where a survey team had been sent 5,000 years ago, during the time of the Fourth Dynasty in Egypt, in search of their fellow humans (it's not clear, even to the protagonists, where the human race originated--here, there, or somewhere else entirely). While they were checking out the Egyptians, the Lucien had attacked the Kinley, and the survey team never returned.<br />Pruit makes it to earth-and that's only the beginning.<br />Arwen Elys Dayton's novel twists and turns along, from multiple points of view: Pruit, her Lucien pursuers, the survivors of the original expedition (yeah, some are still around--wait for it), a young American man who's looking for adventure, and flashbacks to the doings of the survey team at time of the Fourth Dynasty (it's not tipping things off too much to say the pyramids are involved). The author's prose hums along--she handles the action stuff very well indeed and one scene, in which Pruit and one of her enemies must escape from yet another, is an absolute gem of pacing, dialog, and plot advancement. Also deftly done is the way the author handles the reaction of everyone here on earth. Nobody seems all that surprised to learn there are space aliens among us, which makes me assume that Arwen intends this as part of the fun.<br />And it is fun. It's a serious tale alright, but you'll probably get the sense that Arwen managed to entertain herself royally while she was writing it. She'll probably entertain you too. As for me, I can't wait to read what she's going to write next. A sequel perhaps?royally while she was writing it. She'll probably entertain you too.

It was an uncertain time of gasoline rationing, German espionage (the scenes in New York City's Yorkville are especially chilling), FBI surveillance, and the rounding up of U.S. citizens of Japanese extraction, as well as the advent of daylight saving time (then called wartime, hence the title of the book). And it was a time when radio networks functioned similar to the way the &quot;over the air&quot; TV networks do today, producing comedies and dramas.<br />The author not only ensnares the mystery with breathless complications (although the tacked-on &quot;coda&quot; seems unnecessary--the book should have had a colder ending) but he also gives you a taste, by way of his fictional radio station, of what quality radio might have been like, had it only been given the chance. But it didn't get that chance: soon the war was over and television arrived. Radio drama gave way to the dj. As Mr. Harwood, the strange visionary station owner tells Jack at one point, he fears &quot;not that radio's greatest days will fade away but that its greatest day will never come.&quot;<br />It never did.	2003-01-04

(And what _are_ these &quot;wind&quot; things?) But then, after not all that long a wait, the author blows it apart and the novel tumbles into a long, turbulent journey told from multiple points of view.<br />Each of the major characters, the offworlders Calandria, Marya, and Axel, the cyborg General Armiger, and the natives--the &quot;mad queen&quot; Galas and her onetime lover General Lavin, and the coming-of-agers Jordan and Tamsin (playing with home field advantage)--discover part of the reasons why the terraforming, nanotechy &quot;mechas&quot; have become dysfunctional or perhaps even mad (instead of preparing the world for humanity they've turned against it), but it's not until the final battle royal in which it all comes together.<br />It's expertly written and breathtaking in its conception (Ventus may be the most interesting world since Joan D. Vinge's Tiamat), and it's sure to give you a lot to think about. It's a romantically philosophical hard-science fantasy.	2002-12-25

Connie Willis, who apparently can work in almost any style, this time out turns to farce in a delightful sendup of Victoriana, time travel, and the British mystery story.<br />Taking her title from the subtitle of Jerome K. Jerome's late-Victorian comic novel, &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; (its characters even make a cameo here) Willis leads the gentle reader on a giddy chase from Coventry Cathedral at the time of the Luftwaffe's bombings in 1940, to mid-21st-century Oxford (where time travel has arrived but cats are extinct), and back to the Oxford of 1888, and then back to the burning again (the scene in which the Cathedral burns down will probably make you tear up).<br />Like Ms. Willis's time travelers Ned Henry and Verity Mering, you'll meet a lot of not so eminent victorians--a swain, a looney Oxford Professor or two, a Colonel obessed with exotic fish, several butlers, the formidable Mrs. Mering, and her screamlet-filled daughter Tossie who talks baby to her cat, Princess Arjumand--to say nothing of the dog, named Cyril (his likeness appears on chapter opening pages).<br />Much is made of an item known as the Bishop's Bird Stump, which may (or may not) have been in the Cathedral at the time the Luftwaffe destroyed it, and the status of which the 21st-century woman who funds the time travel enterprise, the formidable Lady Shrapnell (pun almost certainly intended), wants determined--she's also funding the reconstruction of the Cathedral at Oxford. (She's pretty much taken over the time-travel ops after the military et al. discover there's nothing in time travel for them because you can't transport objects back from the past--well, except for this cat . . . )<br />In addition to the references to Jerome K. Jerome, Ms. Willis tosses into the pot Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll, Willkie Collins, Conan Doyle, and mid-20th-century writers of classic British mysteries.<br />Don't worry that Ms. Willis seems to make up the rules as she goes along--it matters not a bit (and the publisher clearly knows this--the sci-fi &quot;Bantam Spectra&quot; logo is set aside in favor of the standard-issue rooster trademark). Fans of the profoundly serious and moving &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; (arguably one of the greatest sci-fi novels of all time) may at first be disconcerted at finding the some of the same characters in a comic novel this time out.

Matthews' \\"judiciary\\" series (\\"Prisoner of Conscience,\\" \\"An Exchange of Hostages,\\" \\"Hour of Judgment\\"), described by the publisher as \\"a stand-alone novel\\" in the series (which seems fair: a sequel would be fun but hardly necessary). This time out Inquisitor Andrej Koscuisko is confined to a cameo role, as the action focuses around Bench intelligence Garol Vogel (he himself had a cameo in \\"Judgment\\") who, having offered the rogue Langsariks a home of their own (while banning them from space), now has to prove they're the victims of a frameup: a group is staging bloody raids and blaming it on the Langsariks. Who are they? How are they accomplishing this? Vogel quickly forms some ideas, but proving it is another matter altogether.<br />The tale is told in a multi-POV noirish police procedural style manner (for that matter with some alterations it could have been set in the John Ford-John Wayne west, so readers looking for Catherine Asaro-style science lessons may be disappointed). The real perps are revealed early on and the plot centers on how they will be captured, and whether the capture will come in time to save the Langsariks. In addition to Vogel himself the action focuses on the Langsarik leader Walton Agenis, her nephew Hilton Shires, her beautiful niece Modice, rogue pilot Kazmer Daigule, Cousin Stanoczk the Malcontent, and the wounded foreman Fisner Feraltz. Ms. Matthews skillfully interweaves what the characters are saying with what they are thinking, and these characters are intelligent.<br />Ms. Matthews shows a great sense of place here. Although the novel jumps around quite a bit you'll always know where you are. Her descriptions of dwellings, gardens, warehouse facilities, and the like will give you a great feel for the locations. In one sequence, when Hilton, on warehouse duty, hears two apparent drunks talking nearby, you'll almost be able to smell the dust as he moves along the aisles trying to locate them among the stacks of merchandise.<br />By the way: The author is perhaps paying subtle tribute to Jack Vance here (he would have loved the name Fisner Feraltz, and the Langarsarik colors are \\"rose gold,\\" described as a yellow-pink), although her cleancut prose style is far less ornate than The Master's.

And yet, it's not so much a novel as a series of set-pieces on American popular culture that intermingles imagined scenes from the life of the legendary steel-driving man, the obsessions of collectors, and scenes from late-20th-century pop culture (the novel is set in July 1996 at a \\"John Henry Days\\" festival in West VA--and not so coincidentally at the moment when the dotcom startups were begining to start up). The modern sequences feature a black freelance journalist, J. Sutter, who wants to set a record for junketeering while denying to his writer pals that this is what he is doing.<br />Colson Whitehead, who apparently knows the junketeering life well, performs dazzlingly. There are sequences that will make you want to put down the book and applaud his wordsmithery. Most of the jazz-riff-like setpieces are brilliant (the one in which receipt-collecting, free-riding Sutter remotely dials up his answer-machine messages from his WVA model is a standalone masterpiece) although Mr. Sutter's editor probably should have urged him to lose the wife of the hotel owner who sees ghosts and the interminable county fair scenes that tell us nothing new about county fairs. But you can skim through those quickly and painlessly and go on to the next riff, which you're odds-on to enjoy immensely.<br />There's a big &quot;but,&quot; though: when you reach the final pages, maybe you'll feel that something is missing. Mr. Whitehead's technique is dazzling, alright, but he seems not to have much of an idea of overall form or any sort of pacing. Everything comes at you in the same way and at the same speed. It's like watching the act of a juggler who is an expert at keeping all the clubs in the air, but has no idea how to build the act to some kind of grand finale; and so instead at the end he simply plucks all of his clubs out of the air one by one, takes his bow, and leaves the stage..	2002-09-22

Set about 50 years from now it tells the story of Jaya Nihalani, an Untouchable and a freedom fighter (she's modeled after India's 20th-century \\"bandit queen\\" Poulhan Devi) who is wasting away from a mysterious disease in an Indian hospital. When she overhears her doctor talking to her arch-enemy, the army officer who put down her rebellion (he would have been perfectly happy under the Raj, and maybe Williams patterned him after the infamous British General Dyer), Jaya escapes from the hospital and quickly gets transported to the alien nano-techie \\"depth ship.\\" Yep, the aliens have colonized us and now they've come to see if we're ready for prime time, and only Jaya . . . etc. etc.<br />But quickly events take an unexpected turn, the POVs (and the settings) become multiple (Williams' depiction of the culture of the aliens, at least as hierarchical as Jaya's own, is especially fascinating), and the story becomes bitter and cynical (readers of Williams' previous novel, \\"The Ghost Sister,\\" will hardly be surprised at this turn). The two main alien characters turn out to be neither moral nor immoral (they're neither the all wise and beneveloent Spielberg creations nor the \\"bug eyed monsters\\" of early-20th-century lore), but merely bureaucratic schemers, more concerned with their personal advancement and with \\"office politics\\" than with the fate of the humans who they've created in the first place. There are some great set-pieces: at one point a movie star (she's from Bollywood, not Hollywood--the Americans are always off stage here), who is to appear in a biopic of Jaya's life, arrives at Jaya's hangout on a cloned mammoth with her own private army (complete with a helicopter): she is led to think it's up to her to save the world (not hardly). Like the book itself, it's a great conception.<br />It's bitter, sardonic, and a fast read. Political it may be, but it owes far more to Jonathan Swift than to Ursula LeGuin.

And maybe it's the best tale so far. Not only does it move the Skolian Empire series along in grand fashion, but it also brings some of the incidents in previous volumes (most notably &quot;The Quantum Rose&quot; and &quot;The Last Hawk&quot;) that had seemed to be diversions into the &quot;main line&quot; of the series.  In this episode Catherine zooms in on Dhyianna (Dehya) Selei, the Ruby Pharoah, who's been a shadowy presence in the series until now.<br />Catherine's time line, which appears at the end of every book in the series, simply tells us that in 2277-78, Dehya &quot;coalesces.&quot; Exactly. The novel deals with rebirth, the physical rebirth of Dehya and of the Ruby Dynasty itself, as Dehya sets out to collect the Skolians' scattered surviving members (they've been decimated by a destructive war).<br />Dehya coalesces virtually naked and alone on a primitive world and doesn't quite know why. Throughout the book she keeps acquiring family members, friends, and allies (and clothing), and at the end is quite a formidable presence indeed. The structure in a way is similar to Ravel's &quot;Bolero,&quot; which starts out with a single instrument and a single melodic line and ends colorfully and thunderously.<br />The story sweeps along in grand fashion, filled, as always, with action, romance, and painless lessons in quantum physics, as Dehya learns that sometimes she has to go against the people she admires and work with those she doesn't. All Catherine's characters are complex, reluctant heroes, and Dehya might be the most complex of all. She learns her lessons well and she learns the limits of power.<br />Notes and asides: Newcomers to the series should start with &quot;Primary Inversion&quot; and read the books in the order they're written in. And then, when you're caught up, you can wait breathlessly with the rest of us for &quot;The Moon's Shadow,&quot; which is due out in 2003.athlessly with the rest of us for &quot;The Moon's Shadow,&quot; which is due out in 2003.	2002-08-30

There's nothing cute about it. Nearly all the characters are adults (well, there's a strange cursed puppet and a girl in her early teens turns up at the end, and there are those strange flying things . . . ), and they act adult. Set in a tropical climate during the rainy season you'll start feeling as wet and as sleepless (the protagonists don't manage a full night of sleep during the tale, and you probably won't until you finish it) as do Ms. Wells's characters..<br />The exiled and cursed Maskelle, \\"Voice of the Adversary,\\" returns to the civil and religious capital, Duvalpore, in time for the 100-year rite, in which the wheel of the book's title is renewed. On her homeward-bound journey she acquires a swordsman, Rian, and a troupe of actors. Upon their return they are soon caught up in the usual intrigue among the civil and religious authorities and there's a murder mystery to be solved. Something bad is happening to that wheel. But what? Who? Why? Has somebody created a knockoff wheel somewhere close by? And just when it looks as if Maskelle's figured it out, you realize you're just past the middle of the book. But that's when things really start to get interesting, as it becomes increasingly clear that this world is very different from our own. Things are resolved neatly at the end, no sequel seems required (although you'll probably hope for one), and indeed in a brief interview with the author at the back none is immediately planned.<br />Wells's smooth prose is as seductive as it is fluid (she's especially brilliant describing the landscape and architecture), and less is always more (in one scene you don't realize that teenaged girl has no clothes on until someone loans her a tunic) as the tale glides back and forth between Maskelle's and Rian's point of view. And unlike most medievaliana, the characters eschew the exaggerated forms of address and exaggerated figures of speech (Maskelle addresses her nominal superior, known as  \\"The Celestial One\\" in vernacular terms) and there's plenty of bickering and wisecracking back and forth.<br />This one's for the grownups.figures of speech (Maskelle addresses her nominal superior, known as  \\"The Celestial One\\" in vernacular terms) and there's plenty of bickering and wisecracking back and forth.<br />This one's for the grownups.	2002-08-18

Mid-nineteenth-century that is. With its mysterious shimmering monoliths, which arrive from the future and commemorate the victories of a warlord named Kuin (always 20 years and three months into the future), you're immediately hooked. Where are they coming from? Who is Kuin? How does he manage this? How can he be stopped? And yet, while it's a member in good standing of the classic, \\"problem solving\\" sf subgenre, the book has in its dark heart the same feeling you get with a Hawthorne or Melville novel, and its worldview is quite similar.<br />Mr. Wilson's approach isn't the standard sf \\"everybody pulls together to fight off the new menace.\\" Instead (and maybe he's closer to the truth) the world breaks into factions: some passively wait for the inevitable and hope to make the best deal, like Chamberlain at Munich; others intend to actively and violently welcome the arrival of Kuin, and still others try to figure out how to destroy the monuments.<br />Mr. Wilson creates a grim future of financial collapse and social unrest, and it's convincing. There is a gripping sequence set in Jerusalem, where one of the chronoliths is about to arrive, that you won't soon forget; and if nothing is exactly explained in the end, there's no deus ex machina either, which can be the bane of problem-solving driven sf..<br />The story is told in the first person by the clueless narrator, Scott Warden (you might just as well call him Ishmael, if it weren't for his always managing to do the wrong thing at the right time). When it comes to particle physics he knows about as much as most of us, but since he was present at the creation, he's always along for the ride when events get interesting. He's the only one who could have told the tale: he's normal and everybody else is obsessed.	2002-08-11

As the tale begins Siggy Lindquist, who has been spending her days cleaning a prison word for psycho-killers, is seen going back to her home world, Veil, after a prison break gone wrong. She's injured; a friend is killed. A settlement has been paid. After setting the scene Ms. Thomas, in the first half of the tale, flashes us back to the early days, and then the janitorial career of her protagonist. Then, in the book's second half we are swept up on a fascinating tour de space-time that leads to a breathtaking and totally satisfying conclusion.<br />Siggy who as you might imagine is a very superior sort of janitor (in her way she's like heroes of mid-20th-century sci-fi--the imaginative working stiffs who know more than their overeducated and bureaucratic superiors, and who know that you aren't paranoid if they are out to get you) moonlights as a dance instructor, and ballroom dancing becomes one of the book's themes.<br />The book tangos along through 339 pages (I've no intentions of spoiling the fun by saying more) and it's complete in itself. A sequel would be possible (and you'll probably want to read more about Siggy at that) but it's hardly mandatory.<br />Great concept, grand fun.	2002-08-01

One is, only the widow of the donor demands visiting rights. This has to be a John Irving novel, right? And it is of course. Question 13 in those ditsy little discussion group questions that seem to be appearing at the end of every paperback novel these days asks you to ponder this: \\"In what way does this novel have elements of a fairy tale or fable?\\"<br />For two-thirds of the way through, the answer seems obvious: all ways. Mr. Irving has created a surrealistically marvelous, portrayal of the news media and the people who populate it (the action in the novel is set against real-life events such as a Super Bowl game the Green Bay Packers lost and the weekend John F. Kennedy Jr. died). Patrick Wallingford, the victim, known forever after to the public as \\"The Lion Guy,\\" manages to sleep with nearly every woman he becomes involved with, the widow of the man whose hand Wallingford has been given seems somewhat demented, while the hand surgeon himself, unhappily divorced, seems more obsessed with doggydo than hand surgery. In short, everyone in Wallingford's world seem at least slightly dysfunctional.<br />But then in the last third, it all goes wobbly and sentimental, as the action moves from the Boston-New York axis to Green Bay, and the character of the widow, Doris Clausen, becomes (just when you were imagining Drew Barrymore playing her in the movie version), well, Rene Zellweger, while Wallingford--who you've been imagining as Jim Carrey--morphs into Robin Williams. The last two chapters slog on interminably. It's \\"love stuff\\" time. And sadly, as Mr. Irving's author's note at the end indicates, this was intentional. Indeed, question 14 asks you: \\"Would you call `The Fourth Hand' a Love Story'? Why or why not?\\"<br />Well now! As the cable news channel satirized here would no doubt trumpet, \\"we report, you decide.\\"<br />Notes and asides: Mr. Irving gets moon phases right (unlike so many authors): a moon two or three days from full will indeed set at about 3:00 a.m.ized here would no doubt trumpet, \\"we report, you decide.\\"<br />Notes and asides: Mr. Irving gets moon phases right (unlike so many authors): a moon two or three days from full will indeed set at about 3:00 a.m.	2002-07-27

When she does not return her friends, Estella and Paul--she the best friend, he a (gay) chum of Anna's--act as surrogate parents and rush to Anna's house to relieve the professional babysitter, who has to go home to her family, in caring for the daughter, Lily.<br />In alternating chapters we are given two possible explanations for Anna's failure to return (titled \\"Away,\\" these are told in the third person) after which there is a chapter called \\"home,\\" a first-person narrative related by Estella. This pattern repeats itself for the duration of the journey. Although Ms. Dunant does not specifically say so, perhaps the more sinister version of Anna's fate (she is being held against her will by a stalker) is imagined by Estella while the more romantic one (she has meet a lover and has simply decided to spend one more weekend with him) is imagined by Paul.<br />Regardless, the interwoven tales mesh smoothly, and the prose is lucidly clear. The characters are believable and somewhat sympathetic--even the stalker. It's a gripping read.	2002-07-13

Czerneda's &quot;Trade Pact Universe&quot; series, is as much about love (and looking for it in the wrong and the right places) as it is about resolving all--err, well many--of the plot lines begun in &quot;A Thousand Words for Stranger&quot; and &quot;Ties of Power.&quot; And there are all kinds of love here: love of family; love of friends; even love between species. All the characters from the earlier books return: Sira di Sarc, now Speaker for the Clan Council; her &quot;Chosen&quot; Captain Jason Morgan; her schemeing relatives; Huido, the restauranteur; the twisted schemer Ren Symon; and the maddening Drapsk, who still insist that Sira be their &quot;Mystic One.&quot; An interesting new clan member, Ruti, is also introduced, and she plays a key role in the proceedings.<br />Again the tale, at least slightly tongue in cheek (Sira is captured by Morgan's enemy and everyone else is zipping along trying to find her), rollicks along in alternating &quot;Chapters&quot; (told in the first person by Sira) and &quot;Interludes,&quot; which clue you in to what other characters are doing. Czerneda keeps things moving along to a satisfying, moving finale.<br />While the publisher is billing the book as the end of a trilogy the author does seem to have left the possibility of continuing on (I for one would like to know what's next for Ruti) and I for one hope that she does.<br />Warning: Don't even think about reading this unless you've read the first two books in the series.	2002-07-07

It begins as if it is going to be a straightforward horror thriller, but it soon becomes clear that Michel Faber has something quite different in mind. The novel becomes increasingly strange, revealing its secrets slowly as it spirals toward its end, where one final surprise awaits. It would be a disservice to reveal more. Suffice it to say that along with Caitlin R. Kiernan (\\"Silk,\\" \\"Threshold\\") Mr. Faber is at once reinventing the horror novel while at the same time paying homage to its Lovecraftian past.<br />Despite its grimness, the book is occasionally mordantly funny. It contains elements of the surreal and the satirical, and it leaves you feeling as if the ground were giving way beneath your feet. This insecurity extends even to the 18-question \\"Reading Group Guide\\" that is appended to the book. Question 16 reads: \\"Did your feelings about Isserley change as the novel went on? Can you identify what influenced the way you felt about her?\\"<br />Yes and no.	2002-06-09

Vinge returns to Tiamat, and creates a hard-boiled nourish tale with some of the same characters who appeared in \\"The Snow Queen\\" trilogy (\\"The Snow Queen,\\" \\"World's End,\\" and \\"The Summer Queen). This time out Vinge zooms in on what starts out as a personality conflict between police sgt. B.Z. Gunhalinu, familiar to Vinge's readers, and officer Nyx LaisTree. Eventually the two are forced to team up to thwart a conspiracy that reaches into the highest levels of the police force, and the Tiamat government. Other familiar characters from the \\"Queen\\" novels pass through--Jerusha PalaThion, Fate Ravenglass the Maskmaker, the Snow Queen herself, along with her consort Herne, but Vinge keeps her cold eye directly on the action at hand, which involves vital pieces of the \\"Maguffin\\" tech (never mind what--it hardly matters) that everybody wants.<br />With its naive, conflicted heroes, who never quite figure out what's going on, the tale owes as much to Raymond Chandler as to the \\"Masters of Science Fiction.\\" Chandler once wrote in a letter that he was interested in \\"the strange, corrupt world we live in,\\" and while Tiamat's world is hardly Chandler's LA, the same thing could be said of it.<br />The action moves along swiftly, convincingly, and skeptically. (That's hardly a surprise, as most of Vinge's later work has turned more cynical. She's surely unafraid to give her loyal readers something they haven't expected, and her chance-taking is to be admired.) While \\"The Snow Queen\\" novels (and they're surely among sci-fi's masterpieces), are epic and mythological, this time out, Vinge is more detail-oriented.<br />Imagine a Bosch canvas with a corner blown up and tricked up as a miniature portrait.	2002-06-02

In Melissa Scott's version, people are, but it's hell (many form nostalgiac gated communities just to avoid it).<br />The book is set in an indefinite future America that seems to be a generation or so from now, where most of society seems bent on amusing itself to death, especially people who \\"play the jazz.\\"<br />And the people who play the jazz in Scott's world don't have saxophones; they have web equipment, and the idea is to spread chaos through rumour. (Anyone whose first wakeup call to the dark side of the Internet occurred on the day they received their first e-mail warning about the Good Times virus will quickly get the idea.) In one sequence, in order to create a diversion at one point the heroine, Tin Lizzy, creates chaos at a shopping mall by sending out false rumors of a new product. But let Scott tell it herself, regarding the ultimate jazz her heroine \\"Tin Lizzy\\" plays: \\"this was something people wanted to hear, and this one, too, was picked up and repeated.\\"<br />The story is told from two POVs, Lizzy's (who takes to the road with the teenager she's trying to help) and the cop trying to capture her while staying on the good side of his boss, who's a borderline psychopath. Scott's prose is spare; her characters seem real; the climax is cynical.<br />Each sequence is a beautiful set piece in itself. Despite the title, nothing seems improvisatory. It's all schemed out as carefully as a Bananarama album, and it entertains in precisely the same way.	2002-05-27

Nicholas Christopher's stunning novel has none of the overweening cuteness that is often found in this genre. Instead, you'll encounter in \\"A Trip to the Stars\\" a lush, shimmering novel--its prose hypnotic, its characters and settings unforgettable--that you won't want to come to an end. It's the story of Alma and Loren, separated by a kidnapping at a planetarium in New York, who become Enzo and Mala and spend 15 years wondering what happened to each other--she needs an island, he thrives in deserts--all the while having adventures and meeting interesting people (among them an eight-fingered piano-playing arachnophile, a woman who turns into a vampire, and a wheelchair-bound pool hustler).<br />And the tale is instructional too: you'll learn something about the habits of spiders, go behind the scenes at a mentalists' act, and you'll also be presented with two differing theories on the fate of Atlantis.<br />The tale is told in first-person narratives by Enzo and Mala, in alternating chapters (plus an epistolary interlude that evokes Conrad). The two are writing at some unspecified time in the future of events that take place between 1965 and 1980. A few of the characters turn up in both Enzo's and Mala's narratives, which helps unify the tale.<br />It's a long trip, but it's one that charms as it thrills, and you'll not quickly forget it. And of course if you find that you are forgetting parts, you can always read it again. So the advice here would be: do _not_ loan this book to anyone who isn't likely to return it.<br />Notes and asides: the sun _does_ shine on the dark side of the moon (it's the earth that doesn't); Alfred Hitchcock's wife was named Alma Reville; there was never a planetarium at Manhattan's northern end.  Best read outdoors as spring turns into summer, with Heather Nova's \\"Oyster\\" on your portable CD player.	2002-04-28

This one doesn't advance the saga all that far-it's more of a gapfiller than anything else--but it has a kick to it. The tale starts out as yet another take on \\"the culture that the galactic civilization forgot, and which has regressed\\" and has gone medieval.<br />Sounds familiar? But be not afraid, Toto. We're not in Darkover any more. Asaro has a new angle on the old idea, filling it with romance, high tech, low tech, dance, horselike critters (two brands) telepathy, and oh yeah. Quantum physics.<br />There's enough action for the space opera fans; steamy romance for the romantically inclined; and hard science for those who like their science fiction to emphasize, well, the science (an early version of the first half, we're told, appeared in _Analog_).<br />At heart, though, the story is about growing up and taking charge, as young Kamoj, torn between two men, Vryl of the Skolians and Jax of her own world, eventually finds love in all the right places, and grows as a person. So, in the end, the story is more about the development of character than anything else. And how many genre novels can you say that about?<br />There's enough material here for a 1200-page by-the-numbers trilogy, but Asaro, with her lean, mean, prose style, doesn't waste our time--she keeps things down to a reasonable 403 pages (plus appendixes).<br />This is a must-have for Asaroistas although newcomers would probably be better off starting with _Primary Inversion_ , which led off the series, before they tackle this one.<br />All in all another example of what science fiction can be in the right hands.	2002-03-29

Circles of Confusion, April Henry's first novel,  has a contemporary setting (it was written in the late 1990s), but you'll probably remember it in the bright Technicolor of a 1950s Hitchcock film. The heroine, Claire Montrose (Hitch would probably have cast Doris Day in the part), works in the vanity plate dept. of the Oregon DMV (vanity plate combos are used as section bumpers--complete with a glossary in the back in case there are a few you don't get). That's an occupation that might have got her on a favorite TV show of the era, \\"What's My Line.\\" The Hitchcock McGuffin is a painting she inherited from her aunt, who, as Claire learns from the aunt's diary, she acquired in Germany during WWII.<br />Soon, Claire is off to New York to see if the painting is valuable or not, where she finds one man, Troy, who works at an auction house, who tells her it's a fake, while Dante, who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, thinks it might be a Vermeer (the art history and the WWII history is accurate). Two men, with two different stories. Who's telling her the truth? Is it Granada Claire sees or \\"only Asbury Park\\"?<br />Soon Claire finds herself in the typical Hitchcock situation, an innocent person caught up in intrigue, as she has a series of adventures that won't be given away here (well, all right one--Claire buys an evening dress in New York's Filene's Basement on the Upper West Side--a truly hilarious scene) but that eventually lead her back to her native Portland and a satisfying conclusion. And with the right guy. Is it at long last love?<br />A semiserious fast-paced entertaining read, and since it's the first of the series, chances are you'll be back for the next of Claire's adventures. All in all, there are far worse ways to pass the time.	2002-03-08

Kiernan's elegant, creepydark fantasy is stunning proof that a writer can seldom go wrong writing about what she knows. She is, according to the biography on the inside back cover, \\"trained as a vertebrate paleontologist,\\" who lives in Birmingham, AL. The story takes place there, and fossils certainly figure prominently in this, her second novel, which deals with things that may be lurking inside a water tunnel in the southern city.<br />In Kiernan's tale of the real and yet imagined Birmingham (also the locale of her first novel, the equally stunning \\"Silk\\"), which evokes Beowulf and Alice, to say nothing of Lovecraft (and Jung?) things can go bump in the day as often as at night-maybe more often. In fact, its chilliest passages involve heat and sun and dust and thirst, and psychotic birds that crash into windows. And you'll surely become enthralled with the doings of Chance, Deacon, Sadie, and Dancy.<br />All this would get a four-star rating for the tale. But what makes it worth five is the author's evocative dreamysmooth writing style. Words seem to tumble out Kiernan. She writes like a poet, not a paleontologist.<br />It's best read in the morning, before you forget your dreams, and perhaps with Kristin Hersh's \\"Strange Angels\\" on your CD player.	2002-02-23
US	52074129	R1SJL9C9J71R31	0679462953	613116292	FM: The Rise and Fall of Rock Radio	Books	5	37	40	N	Y	A Voice of Reason	From the hours of 6:00-10:00 a.m. on Saturdays, the tumult and the shouting pauses on New York City's sports talk station WFAN. Host Richard Neer, known to his regular callers as &quot;The Voice of Reason,&quot; is presiding, and sanity reigns, if only for a short while.<br />Of course, New Yorkers have been getting up with Mr. Neer for a long time. Before his present gig as a sports talk host, the author was affiliated with the legendary aor FM station, WNEW, and it's that station's story he tells here, in his usual understated fashion.<br />Neer was music director, program director, overnight jock, and did two stints as the morning man in his 28 years with the station (he stayed to turn out the lights) and in that time he knew and tells us about, such legendary jocks as Jonathan Schwartz, Bill (Rosko) Mercer, Scott Muni (who he seems to admire the most), and Alison Steele (&quot;The Nightbird&quot;). He also knows Bruce Springsteen and devotes a chapter to him, and another to the night John Lennon died. But the heart of the book deals with dumb station managers and dumber consultants. And it deals with them better than they probably deserve: As gracious on his pages as he is on the air, Neer deals fairly even with the people who've treated him poorly.<br />If you've been wondering why your favorite music station doesn't seem to sound quite the same as it did the week before, you may be quite sure it's changed program directors and/or general managers. Again. And Neer tells you how and why that keeps happening. (You won't be surprised to learn that ratings and profits something to do with the constant flux.)<br />Although the author takes pains to discuss FM radio across the country, his emphasis, naturally, is on his own New York experiences at WNEW, and the book will have special meaning for New Yorkers (of which I am one), but you don't have to be from New York to appreciate this well done tale written by a man who's been there, done that. It's a good informative, rant-free read.ve, rant-free read.	2001-10-10

(&quot;The Snow Queen&quot;) have written some of the best science fiction around and Vernor's &quot;Deepness in the Sky&quot; is another gem. It's billed as a &quot;prequel&quot; to &quot;Fire,&quot; but with its clashing human cultures and a fascinating alien culture,&quot;Deepness&quot; stands alone, and sustains its pace through 774 pages.<br />An ambush between the two human factions, The Emergents and the Traders, leaves them both crippled in orbit around an isolated planet that revolves around a variable star that alternates long periods of dark with shorter periods of light. Nevertheless, an intelligent arachnid-like race that is developing technology rapidly, and that  the two cultures have come to exploit in one case and trade with in the other, has evolved on the planet, and both factions wait for them to reach the a point that will enable the humans to &quot;get out of Dodge.&quot;<br />The author's treatment of the alien &quot;Spiders&quot; is especially clever: we see them first through the eyes of the human translator Trixia Bonsol, and they seem quite human. It's only at the end, when the aliens and humans meet, that Vinge fully reveals their differences.<br />Vinge's characters, human and alien alike, are all obsessed in various ways (some forcibly) and the author introduces you to quite a number of them. But you won't have trouble keeping the cast of characters straight, even though Vinge writes from multiple pov's. Things get tied together neatly at the end, although the door certainly stands open for several more tales, should Vinge wish to tell them.<br />The book isn't perfect--the human villains virtually twirl their capes while going &quot;bwaa haa haa,&quot; and a long series of flashbacks involving the trader leader, Pham Nuwen, could have been revealed in a page and a half--but that shouldn't stop you from staying on to the finish. It's a superior effort.	2001-10-03

And when they do, the tale becomes something &quot;very rich and strange&quot; indeed.<br />Tepper, always clever, this time out falls victim to more than a touch of didacticism at the end. She has always displayed a certain mistrust of humanity, especially the male side of it, and those prejudices come through here, slightly soiling what otherwise would have been a perfect tale.	2001-08-21

The trouble is, everybody thinks he's dead, and his &quot;jagernaut&quot; biological enhancements are failing. But of course, he seeks to regain power, although turns out to be yet another of Asaro's reluctant heroes (they always do what they have to do but they're seldom happy about having to do it) as he tries to pick up the pieces left by the destruction of the radiance war (told in _The Radiant Seas_).<br />Asaro writes like an outfielder who makes catching fly balls seem easy. About three-fourths of the way through the novel, Kelric seems to have completed one part of his quest when, at the end of a chapter he apparently stares into the face of his enemy (how _did_ he get there??!!). A sentence later, at the beginning of the next chapter, he thinks otherwise, and then discovers the truth--which turns out to be the key to the whole novel. Asaro does all this in half a page. Half a page!<br />The whole novel is filled with the same kind of faultless, seemingly effortless technique--you'll find in it good science, good sex, good adventure, and sassy AI's, to say nothing of good old plot, character, and action.<br />Like all the books in the series _Sun_ has an electric charge to it. This is what science fiction should be and seldom is any more. Grab it.	2001-05-24

The monarchy had been restored only three years before, and Charles II's crown rested uneasy on his head, in a country still divided by the effects of the civil war of Cromwell's time, and the bitter division between Protestant and Catholic.<br />And in Oxford, at the time the home of the likes of John Locke, Richard Lower, and Robert Boyle (all of whom play a part in the story), a gentle Oxford Don was murdered, and his sometime servant was accused of the crime, confessed to it,  and was hanged.<br />Now, at some unspecified time in the future, four people who were involved in the affair have set down their versions of the story. This multiple-narrator mystery  has (not unjustifiably) been compared with Umberto Eco's novel _In The Name of the Rose_, and it has elements in common with the film _Roshomon_ as well. But you may well see it as more like the Dickens novel Dickens never got around to. Those familiar with the works of the contemporary novelist Peter Ackroyd may also discern some parallels.<br />Most of the characters, down to the apothocary who makes an appearance in the first segement,  actually existed (there's a list of them in the back). But the story is Pears's own, and it gets increasingly complicated as each chronicler, the fictional da Cola and Prestcott, followed by the real John Wallis and Anthony Wood,  supply their own take on the sad events of the hanging of Sarah Blundy (fictional) and offer their opinions on why she did confess to the crime she clearly did not commit. Each of the narrators is not quite what he seems to be, and  each one adds more facts to the tale until at the end, the entire events are apparently revealed.<br />While a knowledge of English history is helpful, it isn't necessary for the enjoyment of the tale. More important is to read carefully. The novel may be long, but nothing is wasted.	2001-03-10

At other times, you'll think it's a lost &quot;Buffy&quot; episode.<br />Set back in the drug- and sex-crazed early 1970s, the book, crammed with Jungian references that won't scare you off, tells the story of Charlotte (Lit) Moylan, at the turning point between adolescence and womanhood, as she slides and glides her way through a most unusual Hallowe'en party held at a properly mysterious mansion (it's the centerpiece of a suburban New York town) presided over by a renegade film-maker, who happens to be Lit's godfather. Hand turns the gothic mansion, with its hidden passages and its motley crew of guests, into a symbol of  the hideous era in which the book is set. And during the course of the  long night Lit not only turns the corner into adulthood, but also transforms herself from used to user.<br />Terrifyingly terrific, superbly written, Hand's genre transcending novel is best read in late autumn, with Joni Mitchell's &quot;Don't Give Up the Sorrow&quot; on your stereo and with all the lights turned up bright.	2000-10-20

She's a great  writer (although she seems at some point to have undergone some aversive  therapy that prevents her from using the word &quot;like,&quot; even when  it's ok to do so). On the very first page she writes about a cat that  &quot;poured to the ground and vanished into an alley.&quot; What a perfect  description of feline behavior. Unfortunately the book's far from  perfect--it's flashback filled and confusing: something to do with this  ex-service woman named Jani, who got mixed up in an alien civil war, got  herself killed, or so they think, but who's actually been fixed up with an  &quot;augmented&quot; body--and everybody's looking for her and somebody  finds her and brings her back to Earth to find out who killed his wife and  she sets out to do so and all the good guys turn into bad guys and vice  versa. Whatever. At the end, I knew who did in the wife and (I think) why  they did it, but I never did figure out why she killed her commanding  officer, or did she?<br />Just a wild guess, but maybe Smith developed this  out of a writing class exercise in which the instructor assigned the class  to write a story using flashbacks. I expect she got an A if that's the  case. And that's fine for learning your craft, but for readers, it's like  picking up the second volume of a trilogy first.<br />But no doubt about  it--Smith's future is bright. And if she decides to go on with Jani's  story, I'll probably go along for the ride.	2000-08-09

But Katie Waitman makes up for this lack in her gracefully written and compassionate first novel. (and  probably you'll discern some similarities with Waitman's Master Mikk and  Vance's Cugel the Clever). _The Merro Tree_ demonstrates that when a  vibrant endeavor is controlled by the dead hand of a bureaucracy those at  the creative end of the process will indeed suffer.<br />The novel generates a  terrific amount of suspense, even though you learn at the outset that Mikk  has been taken into custody for having performed a forbidden dance routine.  The suspense is all in what got him into the predicament in the first  place. You'll probably have the tendency to read rapidly just to see what  will happen next, but the advice here is to slow down, because Waitman, a  skilled wordsmith, makes every one of her words count. Skim over a passage  and you're sure to miss something.<br />Since the publisher herself makes  reference on Amazon's boards to sex with a snake, it gives nothing away to  say that Waitman renders the impossible plausible, thus adding a stratum of  Freud to a work that already has layers enough.	2000-07-12

And, as you'll discover, the main reason why this  is so is their spiderlike mating ritual.<br />The book has a romantic hum to  it (this is the kind of stuff that probably drew you to science fiction in  the first place) and Czerneda will keep you awake reading late at night, as  she displays her conflicted Clansters against a multispecies backdrop  (Huido the alien restauranteur is a creation fans of Jack Vance and Mike  Resnick will salute) that includes, of course, humans.<br />Czerneda proves  herself the master of complex plotlines. Her heroine, the amnesiac telepath  Sira (and maybe she's the best telepathic character since James Schmitz's  Telzey Amberdon) has a compulsion to hook up with the human trader, who  Czerneda has named Captain (Jason) _Morgan_ (yes, Czerneda has quite a  sense of humor and doesn't fear to display it), who is himself not without  telepathic abilities, in hopes that he can help restore her shattered  memories.<br />Czerneda propels Sira's quest along, often recklessly, but she  never drops the reins. The author's technique is clever. What Sira  experiences directly she tells us in the first-person narratives, and what  she doesn't is told in third-person &quot;interludes&quot; tacked on to the  ends of chapters. As the characters drift in and out of Sira's POV, they  leave one narrative and pop up in the other. And the telepaths do have a  way of popping up!<br />Julie Czerneda, like Catherine Asaro (of the superb  Skolian Empire series),  puts the fun back into a genre that's grown more  than somewhat cold and antiseptic in recent years. I'm glad she's joined  the party.	2000-06-16

Her species, the telepathic Clan, whose butts she kicked in  the first book in the series _A Thousand Words for Stranger_ are still  engaged in endless plotting within plotting, and Sira just can't stay out  of it. For which readers can be grateful.<br />In addition to the characters  from the prior book--Captain Jason Morgan, her Chosen; the arthropod-like  restauranteur Huido; the trade-pact &quot;enforcers&quot;; her scheming  relatives--Sira this time out meets up with some new critters, first  amongst them the Drapsk, to whom she's the long sought for Mystic  One.<br />Czerneda's abilities to create species, and worlds, is probably  unsurpassed  these days (you'll probably be able to smell the scummy Ret 7  if not reach out and touch it) and her multiple POV plotting, carried over  from the first book in the series, has her juggling a lot of balls in the  air (and she leaves her characters hanging on plenty of cliffs). But she  never drops the balls (or pushes people over the cliffs).<br />More tales of  Sira and Captain Morgan seem planned. And that's fine with me.	2000-06-16

Jeffery, the Plotmeister, Deaver has done it again. The pursuit of the truly bent serial killer through the noirest parts of New York scenes will have you turning the  pages as fast as you can. But the most interesting aspect, for me at least,  is Deaver's portrayal of his wonderfully flawed characters, quadriplegic  ex-detective and crime scene expert Lincoln Rhyme, who has nothing left but  his own arrogance, until he's begged to take on the case of the man who,  yep, collects the bones of his victims, and his partner reluctant,  redheaded ex-model Amelia Sachs  (&quot;a beautiful woman with a cold  smile&quot; and compulsive nail chewer). Their approach-avoidance  interactions are as interesting as the plot's twists and turns.<br />Deaver's  always been good with women characters, starting with the punkster  &quot;Rune,&quot; of his early efforts, &quot;Hard News,&quot; &quot;Death  of a Blue Movie Star,&quot; and &quot;Manhattan Is My Beat.&quot; But his  Amelia Sachs is perhaps the most interesting, and exasperating of them all.  And with Lincoln Rhyme, Deaver takes the agoraphobic Nero Wolfe one step  farther: he can only use his left pinkie. And his intellect. The serial  killer, who of course we learn more and more about as the plot unfolds, is  a complex character too, as all well-written villains are.<br />What's more,  along the way you'll learn a good deal about how to walk a crime scene and  how to analyze evidence (Deaver thoughtfully provides a glossary); you'll  also pick up a bit of history about old New York and learn what it's like  to live as a quadriplegic.<br />As always in a Deaver novel, there's a  surprise or two awaiting you. And no loose ends are left.<br />So go  immediately to quick checkout!<br />Nitpick warning: Deaver makes one  &quot;New York&quot; error, but since he clearly knows the city so well I  suspect it's deliberate: the only rats you'll find a block from the river  on Morningside Heights would be well behaved critters who normally run  mazes at Columbia University's labs. The nabe he describes is actually a  few blocks north in what's called Manhattan Valley. (Was Deaver rejected in  an attempt to get into Columbia?).<br />On the other hand, yes, Amelia would  be a couple of blocks closer to 11th and 59th than the 20th precinct would  (but Midtown North would be closer yet).

Mixon takes a classic pulp-fiction mad scientist plot, adds to it a neat political thriller riff, and some cyberpunkiana, and then tarts it up with some perceptive, sometimes tongue-in-cheek  speculation on what the world might look like in the mid 21st century (a  MacDonalds on an orbital space station is my favorite), makes sure her  characters are sexually and ethnically diverse, and serves up a potent brew  indeed.<br />Carli D'Auber is the intrepid heroine who everybody's after, and  not always in their own bodies, either (hence the title); the mad scientist  and her team are hideously kinky, while Carli's friends are seriously  flaky. The multiple point of view plot will leave you dizzy (I doubt even  Mixon could have explained it the day she turned it in to her publisher,  let alone today), and grasping at loose ends. But no matter. You'll be  entertained all the way.	2000-05-20

And taking the last bow is certain to be Amanda Chatfield, 15-year-old dark  child of divorce. Forced to spend a hideous summer vacation away from the  indifferent administrations of her social climbing mother Caroline in the  legal custody of her ineffectual father Peter, but actually under the rule  of her stepmother Emma (the Jane Austen reference cannot be unintentional),  who favors her own 11-year-old sunny child, Tess, the sullen Amanda rebels  in the most hideous, if expectable, ways.<br />And yet in this unsparing book,  which evokes Salinger and Wharton as much as Austen, with its multiple  points of view and its tense changes, with its photo-realist evocations of New  York locales, especially its interiors, you'll end up rooting for Amanda.  There isn't much choice: Caroline's selfishness is over the top, Peter  stumbles and bumbles along, making big issues out of tennis lessons, while  the doormatty Emma, who can't even get Tess's live-in nanny to address her  properly, compensates for her personal ineffectiveness by creating petty  rules that she expects Amanda to adhere to, and who of course does not.<br />Robinson writes brilliantly:  her prose is sharp, unsparing, and to the  point. Her characters are well drawn.  Unlike most of us, who as grownups  look back on our schooldays in a golden haze of nostalgia, Robinson hasn't  forgotten the hellishness of adolescence (for Amanda school is something  simply to be waited out), and she shows what happens to adults who have  forgotten. It's a great novel.	2000-02-21

The  plot twists and turns  nicely, and she becomes the stuff legends are made of, as we see from the  clever framing device--the text is woven around  a tale told by caravan  leader to his child at some time in the future. Increasingly the text  itself diverges from the Arabian nights tale the nomad tells, and that only  adds to the fun.<br />Seems as if there's going to be a thousand and third  night, too.
