Not much.  We know the bare facts.  What Greenblatt has done is taken what we do know and extrapolate events in Shakespeare's life as he put them in the plays.  While Greenblatt has not dug up new facts (and probably there aren't many that haven't been discovered yet), he places Shakespeare the man within the age and \\"sees\\" him in his writing about, for example, death, marriage, money, etc.  While Greenblatt perhaps overstates his case, I really enjoyed this book and read it in a few days.  This is highly recommended for anyone interested in Tudor and Stuart history and, of course, Shakespeare. <br /> <br />If I didn't own it already, it would make a great holiday gift for me!	2004-11-12

While I do not think Jane Dunn's dual biography of them provides any new historical information, she does provide a new way of looking at them by placing them together within the confines of one book.<br />For Elizabeth it was more important to be a monarch than anything else.  Perhaps today's royals should take note.  She said many times that she was wedded to her people.  She played the marriage game with aplomb but knew that marriage would diminish her power as the selected male made a play for a share of her power.<br />Elizabeth was also haunted about the question of her legitimacy as one of Henry VIII's heirs.  After all, Henry had bastardized her and the Pope had excommunicated her and encouraged Catholics to dethrone her.<br />Elizabeth's youth had been insecure at the extreme.  She even spent time in the Tower.  She suffered most under Mary I, as she became the focus of dissidents.<br />Mary Queen of Scots was Elizabeth's next heir if you strictly follow the genealogical charts.  While she bore the title &quot;Queen of Scots&quot;, she spent only a short time in her kingdom before being shipped off to France to be raised as the intended wife of the dauphin.  She had a privileged childhood, married her prince (who had become king) and then everthing dissolved when he died and Mary had nowhere to go but Scotland.<br />The story of her antics in Scotland--including two disasterous marriages--contrasted with Elizabeth's placing power before happiness.  In the end, she was booted out of Scotland and ran to England for protection.  She became the focus of many plots and ended on the block.  Before she died, however, she recreated herself as a martyr to the Catholic faith.<br />The contrast between the two women could not be more stark.  So long as Mary was alive, Elizabeth could not rest easy.  What would Mary have been like as Queen--probably a disaster if she thought to reimpose Roman Catholicism.<br />Thisis a well written book that anyone interested interested in British history should enjoy.  It is not, however, a historian's dual biography.  I would have preferred a bit more of that but perhaps most reader's would not.<br />I did enjoy this book and read it in 3 days.  I recommend it!	2004-02-14

Anyone who is Jewish and had grandparents from the Old Country will recognize all the dialogue.  I thought I knew a lot of people like some of the characters.<br />The issues involved are family interrelationships--and angst--which are always good material for writers about Jewish families (plenty of angst there), Nazis, the German-American bund, insularity among Jews (don't you DARE marry someone who isn't Jewish!) and the Depression.<br />I have to say that, being Jewish, I really enjoyed the book.  Some the dialogue caught me guffawing loudly on the subway train.  I got a few funny looks due to the guffaws. :-)<br />I will quote one bit from page 53.  A distraught discarded husband is trying to talk to his wife on the apartment house entry intercom.  At one point a woman comes up and wants to get into the building but cannot buzz her apartment to get in because Joe (the discarded husband) is monopolizing the intercom.  <br />\\"Well,\\" the woman said, \\"I'd really like to stay for the next episode, but now could you step aside and let me buzz my apartment?\\"  <br />It reminded me of all the yentas (and yes, men can be yentas) of my childhood.<br />This book is a nice short read (250 pages).  Anyone wanting a look back into the Jewish immigrant experience will enjoy it.	2003-11-22

No it is not the SALT II talks.<br />It is a history of salt the seasoning.<br />This is a very well written book about the world's most common seasoning--and one man needs to live.<br />You will learn all about how salt was mined or gathered in different areas of the world and how salt was used as a preservative before refrigeration.<br />Kurlansky has a very interesting way of looking at history through food.  The book is sprinkled (pun intended) with recipes.  For the most part they are not ones you would want to try, but they give you a historical insight into cooking through the ages.<br />I am just sorry that the author has died so we cannot look forward to any more well written books by him.	2003-06-15

Having said that, the ending is totally unsatisfying.  In fact, I felt there was really no ending and perhaps the author was setting us up to &quot;have to&quot; buy the sequel to find out how the story turns out.  I have firm beliefs about &quot;series&quot; books: Each book must stand on its own.  As I used to tell my kids when they wrote stories in grade school, &quot;Each story has to have a beginning, middle and an end.&quot;  This book got stuck in the middle.<br />By the way, in view of Sugar's musings in the book she is writing about her life as a prostitute in 1870's London, I had anticipated a far different ending--and a resolution to her relationship with Rackham.<br />The book is over 800 pages and I would not recommend wasting time reading it only to be dissatisfied with the way it doesn't turn out.	2003-05-23

Basically the Germans lost because they were exhausted.  France was in ruins.  Germany was never invaded.<br />The &quot;Big Four&quot; sat around the conference table to divvy up Europe and the Near East and we have lived with the results ever since.<br />This book details the events that took place in Paris in 1919.  Woodrow Wilson, who was already ill, was obsessed with his 14 points.  However, those points did not always fit what the big powers saw as their national interest.  Compromises were made and we are still living with the results--for example the borders in the Middle East which often have more to do with the French and the British than they do to where the ethnic groups actually live.  Think about Iraq: It's a mishmosh of groups.  Then there is Turkey, whose borders resulted from events on the ground (as in Ataturk).<br />This is a well written book that will interest any history nut.  It should appeal to a larger audience, however, due to the current interest in events in the Middle East and the continuing turmoil in the Balkans.  After all, it was the turmoil in the Balkans that began World War I.  Somethings never change.	2003-05-16

You see it every time you pick up an atlas and look at a world map with all its longitude and latitude lines.<br />Well, lo and behold, Mercator was a person, Gerardus Mercator, not just a projection.<br />This is a terrific book for anyone interested in history that goes beyond the ordinary.  In fact, there have been a lot of books about scientific history and this is a worthy addition to the genre.<br />Mercator was born in poverty in the Low Countries and lived to become the preeminent geographer of his time when drawing an accurate map involved doing the best you could from limited resources.  Starting with globes he created the conventional way of putting a map on a flat surface with minimal distortion.<br />This is not the easiest book to read, but it was excellent.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to deal with history beyond the usual political history.	2003-03-24

This is a fine read that deals with the California gold rush of 1849 and the idea of paradise in California that began with it.<br />The hardships people suffered going to the gold fields were unbelievable.  There was, of course, no transcontinental railroad and no Panama Canal.  When they got to California, few of them struck it rich from gold.  The ones who did were mostly there when it got started.<br />The smart '49ers went into business supplying the miners.  The problem was that when the boats brought in the supplies, they were immediately deserted by their crews--all of whom went to strike it rich mining a claim.<br />This is a well written book and will be liked by history nuts like myself as well as more general readers.	2003-03-13

I read it going back on the DC Metro, so it is an easy read.	2003-03-09

The one existing daguerotype of Franklin, which I had not seen, is included, as are the recent discoveries and theories about what happened.<br />At a bargain price, this is a nice gift book.

Mine came without that tell tale black &quot;bargain stripe&quot; on the spine.<br />I found one drawback to be that the photos are not identified as to location except in the back of the book.  The logic behind this is that they are supposed to evoke the atmosphere of what was said in the books (which may not have been a specific place) rather than a specific location.  OK, then why put the locations in the back?  Looking back there to identify the locations was cumbersome.	2003-03-09

McCullough is our best popular historian.  His books read like novels.  They are as well researched as some ones written by professional historians and, yet, they are written for everyone to enjoy.<br />McCullough makes an excellent case for John Adams being more important than Thomas Jefferson.  After reading this book, I have to agree.  Adams was not only our our second president but a preeminent legal scholar who had a big hand in writing our Constitution.  He had a committed relationship with his wife Abigail although they were apart for years at a time while Adams fullfilled his duties for the new republic.  After all, Abigail couldn't take a jet plane back and forth to wherever John was.  She stayed home and ran the farm.<br />When Adams died, he did not die rich<BR>I would love it if McCullough would write a book about John Quincy Adams for his next topic.  That boy really had an interesting life!  He was schlepped to Europe with his father and learned French and Dutch.  Then he was sent to Russian as a secretary to the American ambassador when he was in his teens.  After all that, going to Harvard was an anticlimax.	2003-03-03

I then decided that this genre of Harvard history book has been beaten to death.  Those of us who actually went to these \\"select\\" schools know the big secret that those who went elsewhere do not: They are just like every other school with, perhaps, a more intellectually dynamic student body.<br />Unfortunately, Ms. Rogers Hope chose to concentrate on a few of the women with whom she went to law school.  Perhaps they were the ones who cooperated with her in writing this book. Perhaps they were the ones with the most interesting lives.  Fundamentally, the women were no different than the women in my class many of whom did not have stellar careers or exciting lives.  They just worked as lawyers and that was achievement enough.<br />And, I just got a survey from someone in the class of '72 who wants to interview me for a book about the classes of 1970-1971.

That is not meant as a criticism.  It is meant as a selling point.  There are not thousands of footnotes, but do you really read those things?<br />This book should interest historians, people who travel frequently to London and the general reading public who are just curious.  It takes us back into the world where death from plague was a daily threat and parents lost child after child.  Death was a daily companion.  Age 35 was an old man.  People married young because they had to.  By 40 they would probably be dead--especially women who dropped like flies in childbirth.<br />Then, one night in a baker's house in Pudding Lane the house caught fire.  At first it did not look like much but eventually it consumed virtually the entire old city of London.<br />Efforts to fight the fire, led by Charles II and his brother James, Duke of York, were unsuccessful.  With the primitive water mains broken, the only way was to dynamite houses.<br />When it was all over, the medieval city was gone to be replaced by ruins.  The plague disappeared helped along no doubt by the immolation of the rats.  Rebuilding began immediately.  We all know (or should) about Sir Christopher Wren building all those churches.<br />And punishment for the fire?  One deranged man, who had nothing to do with it was executed.<br />I read right through this book and so will you.  Enjoy!	2003-03-02

Christopher Wren, didn't he rebuild St. Paul's after the Great Fire.  Yes, he did that--and rebuilt all those parish churches too.

His achievements were monumental (pun intended) but they want far beyond the architecture we know about (which in his old age he referred to as \\"rubbish\\").  <br />His was an astounding life.

It is, however, a nice overview of the subject and an easy read for anyone interested in German and/or Jewish history.<br />As someone who is Jewish and has traveled to Germany several times, I found many observations in this book that I can confirm from personal experience.<br />I enjoyed the mention of the klezmer revival in Germany, as I went to one of those concerts in Berlin a couple of years ago.  I did note that the artists were young Germans, who were not Jewish.  There is a lot of curiosity in Germany among young people about what was lost.

So, I bought this book as a family obligation and with some trepidation.  <br />Wow!  This, I can read!  The articles are well written and even a jazz ignoramus like me can understand most of them.  If you are a novice as I am, you will learn a lot and also be able to understand more of what you are hearing when you listen to the music.  I know I want to buy more DVD's--including Bill Kirchner's, of course.<br />For those of you who know jazz, I am certain that some of the articles in this comprehensive book will tell you things that you never knew.  Others will enhance what you already knew.

It is a book it will take you awhile to read.<br />The strongest parts of the book involve July 3rd, which includes Pickett's charge.<br />Not being familiar with all the officers and men, the book would have benefited by a letter next to each name every time it was initially mentioned in a new context stating whether I was dealing with &quot;U&quot; for a Union guy or &quot;C&quot; for a Confederate guy.  I sometimes had to read and reread to figure out which side was being discussed because this battle was really many battles over a period of 3 days.<br />Having said all of this, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Civil War as the definitive book on the battle.  I know I am going to revisit the battlefield after reading it--and I have been several times.<br />I gave it a 5 star rating with a reservations.  While it is definitive, it is not an easy read.  For myself, I could have been spared some of the details, but others might thrive on that sort of stuff.

It often did not.<br />Many went to great lenghts to obtain a certificate naming them as an Aryan.  Hitler actually reviewed almost all these requests.  Applicants had to submit detailed photographs.  No one who \\"looked Jewish\\" need apply.<br />Despite their desire to serve, many half Jews (with one Jewish parent) were discharged from the Wermacht.  After all, to Hitler and his Nazi fanatics, being a \\"pure Aryan\\" was more important than winning the war.  Those with only one Jewish grandparent were often allowed to stay in the service, but anyone with Jewish roots often found promotion impossible.<br />Did you know former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was 1/4 Jewish?<br />Anyone interested in German Jewish history and/or the Nazi era will find this book absolutely fascinating.	2003-03-02

Just be aware that personal details of Hirohito's life are not what this book is about.  It is about the public Hirohito and the &quot;Making of Modern Japan&quot;.  I found that a bit of a disappointment, but apparently the Japanese protect the private life of their titular rulers--even now.  <br />What makes this book significant is that it details Hirohito's total involvement with decisions made in his name during the Second World War.  The fiction that he, well, was &quot;just the emperor and didn't make policy&quot; is exposed for a lie.<br />Why wasn't Hirohito tried as a war criminal?  Well, MacArthur thought he was worth more alive than dead.  Many of the military men who served him and carried out his orders, however, either committed suicide or were tried as war criminals.  History just isn't fair, is it?<br />This book was an eye opener for me as I do not know much about Japanese history (as opposed to Europe or the US).  It made me want to know more.  It is not an easy read, but go fer it!	2003-03-02

Yes, it was an important battle, but this short book really just gives us an overview.  It is fine for the non Civil War specialist, but those who are maniacal about the Civil War will want more detail.	2003-03-02

This biography of Samuel Pepys was just terrific, so I had to say something about it.<br />I am a history buff and suppose anyone buying this book would have to be.  Samuel Pepys, as it turns out, was a lot more than just a diarist.  He was, in effect, what we would call Secretary of the Navy during the Restoration.<br />Raised as a Puritan, he successfully made the switch to a Stuart supporter when The Restoration became inevitable after Oliver Cromwell died and his son just did not measure up to the job.<br />We are taken into the world of an ambitious man clawing his way up to the top of the greasy pole.  He knows how it is done--and how to make money from bribes (and convince yourself that you are not doing anything immoral at the same time).  The way things were done in 17th century was a bit different than it is in the modern US--and perhaps a bit of the same.<br />The most riveting bit about Pepys life was an operation he underwent in 1658 for the removal of a bladder stone.  It goes without saying that there was no anesthesia in those days.  First they tied you down and then they cut and probed; there is an illustration of someone trussed up like a turkey with a probe inserted in--well, you have to see it.<br />Great pain and death was a daily companion for those living before anesthesia--and I am not even going to talk about tooth pain.  Death, moreover, was all around.  Children died from all sorts of diseases that are easily curable now.  Any sort of fever could end in death--and, of course, there was bubonic plague, which killed off about 1/6 of London's population in a single year.<br />I found this book absolutely riveting.  It is 378 pages of text (and oodles of pages of notes for the compulsive people like me who read them).  I read it in 3 days.<br />If you are interested in English history you will love this book.  Maybe one of these days I will even get around to reading Pepys' diaries.will even get around to reading Pepys' diaries.	2003-02-16

Recently, I sent it in a large shipment of used paperbacks to my daughter, who is working in Germany and was starved for English language reading.  She enjoyed it as much as I did.  Her statement was \\"I couldn't stop reading it.\\"  You won't be able to stop reading it either.<br />I am not a fan of Oprah's TV show (I have NEVER watched it) but she has done a great thing for quality female authors with her book club.  Whether or not you buy this book because Oprah has endorsed it, I defy you not to like it.<br />Did I say it was a great book?	2002-02-18
US	51704632	RGHXGJ5WFWVNX	0060928832	664906388	From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Not an Easy Book but Very Worthwhile	This book will give you a good overview of the last 500 years of Western Civilization.  I did find it much stronger in the first part of the book (the Renaissance &amp; Reformation) than I did with recent history.  I think that reflects the predilection of the author as well as the fact that for recent history perspective is lacking.  It is hard to write history while one is experiencing it.<br />In light of recent events, the author might want to redo the recent history portion of the book for a new edition.	2002-01-13

The author makes a strong case for this month as pivotal in American history.  Lincoln's assassination was the first of many presidential assassinations.  The country was convulsed but didn't fall apart.  After what we suffered on September 11th, this book bears reading.<br />The book is fluidly written.  I whipped right through it.	2002-01-09

If you are looking for an unbiased biograph, do not look here.  Compared to &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot; and &quot;Cromwell&quot;, this book was just not up to Ms. Fraser's usual high standards.  I could not wait for this book to come out, ran out and bought it and read it immediately.  While reading it, I kept wondering, &quot;This is Antonia Fraser?&quot;  Ms. Fraser would have written a much better book if she could have seen the good and bad in Marie Antoinette.  Yes, she was a pawn of history.  Yes, she was a devoted mother.  BUT, she was part of that aristocratic world which presumed that certain people were--by reason of birth--better than everyone else.  Ultimately she paid a price she really didn't deserve to pay.<br />Next time I'll wait a bit longer to run out and buy a book by Ms. Fraser.	2002-01-08

There are some color plates but a lot of the art is in black and white.  There should have been a lot more color plates.<br />I found the going pretty heavy here and it is very annoying to have to turn back and forth to see the photographs referred to.  There are also a lot of references to art work using catalogue numbers, which I did not understand at all.<br />I took a long time to read this book--reading other less heavy books at the same time.  You will take a long time to read this one too.  It may, however, turn out to be the definitive book on Venitian art during the Renaissance.  I am not certain, however, that it is a read for the average person.  I ultimately read everything I purchase, so I read this one.  If I had known how difficult this book would be to read, I probably would not have bought it.  Having read it though, I am glad I did.	2002-01-08
US	51704632	R85HM9LO5WKCS	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	3	4	N	N	One Great Book	Would you believe I read this one in two days?  I did.<br />John Adams doesn't get as much play as Thomas Jefferson among the so called &quot;founding fathers&quot; but David McCullough makes a good case that he was the greater of the two men.  He was a key player--and maybe THE key player in the writing of the Consitution.<br />I especially enjoyed the discussion of his &quot;soul mate&quot; relationship with Abigail.  She was an amazing woman but, at the time she lived, women stayed home and raised children--and that is what she did (even when John Adams was sent to Europe as an ambassador)--but she was definitely a mover and shaker behind the scenes.<br />After reading this book, I purchased &quot;Dearest Friend&quot;, which is a biography of Abigail.<br />David McCullough is probably the best writer of American history for the masses (as opposed to the scholars) around.  Come to think about it, this would stand up to most scholarly works.	2002-01-08

In fact, while it is a much shorter book than &quot;Adams&quot;, it took me much longer to read.  That is because Mr. McCullough is a much more fluid writer than Mr. Ellis.  If I had to choose between &quot;John Adams&quot; and &quot;Founding Brothers&quot;, I would go with &quot;John Adams&quot;.  Having said that, &quot;Founding Brothers&quot; is a worthwhile book and illuminates the personal relationships among the &quot;Founders&quot;.	2002-01-08

This book should be required reading for anyone interested in the current problem with terrorists after the strikes at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  Halberstram deals with the mistakes Bush the First and Clinton made in dealing with Yugoslavia.  I just hope all the folks dealing with the current crisis read this book before making decisions.  Judging from the way they are handling the situation, whether they did or not, they appear to have learned from the mistakes of Bosnia &amp; Kosovo.<br />Halberstam is a fluid writer and makes the subject of foreign policy--which can be very dry--come alive.<br />I read this one in 3 days.	2001-10-10
US	51704632	R2YFEVOZZJSROG	1569471592	94286646	Murder in the Marais (Aimee Leduc Investigations, No. 1)	Books	5	0	5	N	Y	A Real Page Turner	It's 1993 and an old woman is dead in the Marais, Paris' Jewish quarter.  Detective Aimee Leduc is hired to help solve the crime.  The plot, which involves betrayals from the Vichy era, has a lot of twists, murders (and  attempted murders) and will keep you turning pages until you found out who  done it. I enjoyed this book very much with its evocative Paris setting.   You will enjoy it too!  I recommend picking up a copy and taking it with  you on vacation.  Your vacation agenda may get a bit delayed when you can't  put it down!	1999-06-19
