V.I. may be a bit preachy, the story may have a rather slow start, but spending time with V.I. is a pleasure. She's intelligent and has a deep history that her readers know and that Paretsky draws on for background.  <br /> <br />Compare this to Lisa Scottoline's latest, where she tries to keep pace with Janet Evanovitch's humor and fails miserably. Paretsky is true to herself and her character, who has grown deeper, more mature and more interesting over the years. Or compare this to Sue Grafton whose character has dwindled to a mere set of ticks. <br /> <br />I'll take Sara Paretsky anyday.	2005-09-05

It would have been better at 200 pages sticking to the mystery of who killed the actress. Instead there's a lot of kind of sick and not believable stuff about Dutch (why is this her nickname?) and her boyfriend Michael. Meanwhile, she's flirting with Buddy. And then there's her mom. Too much. This book is unfocused and the main character's quirks are too weird. Skip it.	2005-08-13

The characters are complex, their interactions and dialogue realistic within the context of a police procedural. Jake Hines' police work and his life with Trudy are an excellent combination. And, best of all, the author has not felt it necessary to stuff her story full of extraneous material in order to produce a 300-page book when a 200-page book does the job.	2005-08-11

I have now read more than 200 pages of this book. Every event in it is predictable and the ones that might not have been are forecast by the author in her \\"now\\" chapters. Every character feels as if he/she was created piecemeal to suit the author's purposes. None of them feels real. Take Gilbert, for instance. Is he an educated, thoughtful person, or a baffoon who invests in bees? Don't know. I think the author merely had those two stories available, the one about being black in England during WWII and the one about witless beekeepers, and grafted them together in the character of Gilbert to prove her points about the two countries. <br /> <br />I don't understand Hortense's motivations either. Why exactly does she marry Gilbert? Can she who grew up on a farm, really be so prudish and so lacking in knowledge about what marriage means?  <br /> <br />I liked Queenie at first, but she, too, is a melange: an uneducated farm girl who marries a man she doesn't care for at all for reasons I can't understand. <br /> <br />Now that I've read reviews and know nothing much will happen in the 1948 present, and that the ending is contrived and doesn't resolve anything, I've decided to move on.	2005-06-29

I had no sense that they existed beyong the moments when they appeared in the story.

MFK Fisher was a fascinating, exasperating person who had a fabulously interesting life with sojourns in France, mysterious love affairs and a zillion excellent meals. <br /> <br />The author does a wonderful job of never, ever boring the reader.

So-called beautiful writing with a cliched story and empty characters. The men in the story seem flesh and bone, but their lives and relationships are less than believable. The young widow in the story is totally unsympathetic and I couldn't understand how she ended up in the life she has. Her daughter, age 9 supposedly, seemed more like 11 or 12.

The author tells the story of her parents' love match -- a young Scottish woman marries a Russian man and moves to his country -- and the family events that followed, including her own birth. Very charming and sad. I'm so glad Ms. Fraser wrote an autobiography instead of trying to turn her story into a novel as so many younger writers from potentially interesting backgrounds are doing today. This way she was able to include various events that were exciting, fun or touching without stretching to find some novelistic reason for including them.	2005-04-18

As it turned out, the line was short, but I kept reading when I got home. This is my first Jake Hines and I didn't feel lost. I liked all the characters and the fact that it took awhile to sort them out. The detecting was excellent and the pace perfect. <br /> <br />Only slight quibbles: Jake is awfully nice, but then I was glad to read a non-hardboiled detective. On the other hand, I wasn't completely convinced he was a guy. I mean I accepted that he was a guy and had a girlfriend, but as a guy he was almost too good to be true, what with how nice he treated everyone. <br /> <br />That said, I plan to start with the first book and read my way through all of them.	2005-01-07

It was pleasing to read a memoire with really nice parents, even if their childraising strategies were bizarre. <br /> <br />But when I got to the parts about Catherine's life age 10 and after, the charming, funny, strange, scenic stories and well-realized characters were replaced with essayistic writing concentrating on her Catholic faith or lack thereof and descriptions of what seemed to me cliched Catholic nuns and priests. I lost interest, but read to the end. <br /> <br />I wish there had been some kind of conclusion drawn, or a wrap up of how her life developed after the last episode, but no such luck. I felt let down. <br /> <br />Oh, well, I was entertained for the better part of a week. What more can you want?	2004-12-11

Rather it was about her son, Miles, who decides he's going to build an airplane (in about 1876). The other part of the book is about Isabel, a spoiled rich girl. It takes about 140 out of 198 pages for them to meet, and predictably fall in love. Or maybe fall in love. Miles is totally lacking in emotions and has very little to say for himself. He's hiding the secret of wanting to fly. <br /> <br />The other characters in this book are wacky and reasonably interesting. It simply does not go anywhere much. Lots of good details, but no real story.  <br /> <br />I've read a couple of other male Australian writers, Peter Carey and Tim Winton. Why are they so peculiar? Are there any women Australian writers? Are they weird too?	2004-12-01

I so much wanted their relationship to work out, that when at one point I wasn't sure it would, my \\"heart fell.\\" <br /> <br />They were totally alive to me, as were the supporting cast of parents, brothers and friends. The descriptions of the way Zeke responded to life were clear and fascinating. I was particularly charmed by his encounter with the nurse, Jill, and their few days together in Boston. <br /> <br />There were a few tiny points that might have been hard to believe, such as Jill's beginning her work as a nurse the day after she arrived in Boston from London, but I accepted it all because it was so obvious that Livesey cared about her characters. <br /> <br />I recommend this highly to anyone who has suffered through books whose characters' actions make no sense and through books that are written only to confuse the reader. In this case, I knew exactly how I was supposed to feel when it ended.	2004-11-12

The first few adventures were well written, with lots of interesting details and personal observations, plus meetings with locals. I particularly enjoyed her not-the-usual tourist activities in Cuba. <br /> <br />I was impressed by her ability to enjoy the courses she took without giving lectures to the reader. But that changed when she went to see gardens in Provence. Boorrrinnnggg! I'm not a gardener and I barely made it through that chapter. The writer's workshop in Prague interested me as a person who's been to Prague and to U.S. workshops. But she didn't make friends with a single student, and frankly, I thought she was in way over her head as a journalist trying to write fiction. Her efforts to write about the Holocaust were persumptuous to say the least. I was deeply offended and skipped her italicized fiction. <br /> <br />The last chapter, about border collies in Scotland, was even more boorriingg than the gardens chapter. I simply could not read it, having read an entire book on the subject about ten years ago. Ugh. <br /> <br />I also agree with reviewers here who want to know how and why she chose her destinations. And who paid for them!! Luxury hotels and all.	2004-10-22

Here are some of the reasons I was not completely drawn in: <br /> <br />As I read this book, I wondered why the author had told me in the first chapter what would happen to the \\"girls.\\" Maybe she just figured everyone already knew because this was history, so it wouldn't matter. But it did remove any possible suspense, even about how the end came. <br /> <br />The \\"girls'\\" voices were somewhat the same and their reactions to various situations too stock for each of them. <br /> <br />The book was over for me once the \\"girls\\" were grown up and became rebels. <br /> <br />I never really believed that they had a huge role in the underground. Except for Minerva, they all seemed too naive. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I do recommend this book because I learned from it about a time and place that I had known nothing about except the name \\"Trujillo.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-07

This book meandered through what was basically a non-plot. The American police woman was so poorly drawn she could have said anything at anytime and it wouldn't have made a difference. Often she served simply as a question-asking device so that the reader could be given information about Chinese culture. And the clothes she wore... Yikes! No female American police officer would wear a white dress and high heels to interview suspects. Duh!  <br /> <br />Also, I didn't see how the poetry Chen writes and recites was relevant to the plot in anyway, nor could I get a true reading on his personality. <br /> <br />Finally, the writing was amateurish in terms of plot and character development. I don't plan to read Qiu again, unless a new book receives really fabulous reviews. <br /> <br />	2004-10-02

I liked it this time, but found the writing pretentious. Why should I read entire paragraphs without understanding them when I have read, understood and enjoyed other \\"difficult\\" books from Tolstoy to Bellow to Atwood? Maybe the problem is that this is British from an unfamiliar era. Oh, well. I didn't really like any of the characters. Caro was cold, Grace a whimp, Christian self-involved, Ted a martyr, Paul egocentric. The protraits of minor characters such as Caro's fellow office workers were the best part of the book. The plot was nothing much and the end...well, did they live happily ever after or not? I couldn't figure it out.  <br /> <br />But it did keep my attention and entertain me for a week.

For instance, that his wife is studying for the bar while being a black belt in Karote and raising a three-year-old disabled child. And that Donovan is the perfect dad and husband. I also thought most of what the three-year-old son did and said was more appropriate for a very smart five-year-old. (I have a four-year-old, highly verbal grandson, so I know whereof I speak.) <br /> <br />Anyhow, I liked the plot, the NY/Brooklyn color, the relationship between Donovan and his partner Mosko, although again, Mosko was a bit larger than life and a bit too good to be true. <br /> <br />Oh well, I read this for fun and fun it was.	2004-08-16

I have enjoyed many of Julie Hecht's stories in the New Yorker, but I don't feel that her style can sustain a reader's interest for 227 pages. I read the whole thing, but was puzzled by it. The first 20 or so pages never mention &quot;the boy,&quot; then all of a sudden, his life is the whole focus. <br />I suppose the main character is revealed by her reactions to events in the boy's life, but not much. She is the same character who appears in the stories and much of this is a continuation of the stories which in themselves were somewhat chronological in the character's life. If a reader comes to this without having read any of the stories, he or she is bound to be lost.<br />I found the boy totally unsympathetic and not a believable character. I was much more interested in the main character's observations on modern life and her trips to various stores. I would have liked to learn more about her relationship with her husband. It's amazing that she has one. Who could live with her?<br />Anyhow, if she writes another book, I won't be reading it. Enough is enough.	2004-04-12

I grew tired of the characters and especially the main character whose personality was decidedly wobbly. Was she tough or one of those women who faint at the sight of blood? Author couldn't seem to make up her mind. Oh, well, the book is back at the library now so I can forget about it. Already did.	2004-01-31

This is a tightly written short novel with excellent characterization and a complex, slowly evolving plot. The setting, Naples, Italy, in about 1952, is different and mysterious to me. The story said a lot about human nature and the peculiar ways that love and friendship evolve. I recommend it highly.	2004-01-27

They are deeply felt, wonderfully detailed, highly realistic and with excellent characters. Toward the middle are a few stories more &quot;poetic&quot; in style that appeal to me less. The last stories return to the old neighborhood and again, the  perfectly noted details and highly individualized characters drew me back into the lives of that time and place. Highly recommended for those who enjoy short fiction and anyone who appreciates excellent writing.	2004-01-02

Up until then it is written in alternating points of view: Stephen and Kate each have a story to tell and a historical connection through Kate's dead husband. <br />On page 204, the reader is suddenly given Justine's point of view (she is Stephen's much younger lover). Her thoughts are ordinary and banal. Then we are admitted to the view of Justine's father, Alec, for just a few pages. All this in the service of explaining a story that would be better left subtly unexplained. <br />Why was the author so determined to explain everything? To make everything come out even, so to speak? <br />The book is neatly tied up in the last fifty pages and the reader is left believing everyone will live happily ever after, at least for the near future. I just didn't buy it.	2003-12-27

Omigod! After about 200 pages, the end was predictable, but so what? I actually lay on the couch for 90 minutes reading because I really wanted to know how it would end anyhow.<br />I think Piercy did admirably well for an older adult writing from the point of view of an 18-year old in 2000. Sometimes I cringed at the conversations, but not too much, as I am also an older adult.<br />Piercy is true to her &quot;lefty&quot; beliefs, applying them even now long after the sixties have ended. I admire that. And some of her metaphors and analogies are excellent. She has the right balance of description and conversation. Blake was believable and not predictable. I liked his parents and his story.<br />All in all, a satisfying read.	2003-12-23

The guy is rather an emotional mess, but a close observer of the other characters who are less clearly drawn. His wife is highly predictible and says the same things each time she appears. The Arabs are interesting, but stereotypical. <br />The plot is creaky and the chapter in which the complex sitation between Rivlin's son and the son's ex-wife is finally explained, seems completely contrived. Rather than offering a satisfying conclusion to the book's plot, it feels tacked on, an easy way out for the author who's dug himself a hole. Also, I had guessed the &quot;secret&quot; hundreds of pages earlier. Maybe I was supposed to, but Rivlin never did. <br />The ending, too, is contrived in that everything seems to have worked out for the best.<br />I like Yehoshua's writing, but there is something heavy about it. The book is long and I struggled to stick with it, not because I was bored, but because the people in it were so anxious that they made me anxious, too. The details about life in Israel, for Jew and Arab, were fascinating. I am assuming they are close to reality.<br />But for readers new to Yehoshua, I recommend Mr. Mani.	2003-12-18

I was offended by the author's use of the Holocaust. Sara Peretsky did a much better job of this in her last mystery, and even then I considered it taking liberties, but at least her rendering was not a cliche. <br />Who is this Claire, the main character? Is she a detective? Is she just a person who keeps encountering crimes by accident? What does she do for a living?<br />I might know had I read the earlier books, but I didn't, so hey, how about the author giving me a little background? Claire is incredibly boring. She never even eats anything interesting. And her boyfriend speaks like a textbook. <br />I quit reading after Claire's wraparound skirt was dragged off of her by a flushing toilet. Just too stupid to believe.	2003-12-03

I enjoyed the first hundred pages, but the thin, predictable plot dragged on and on, until on page 290 I quit reading. Ugh. The characters were idiots. The author repeated details about them halfway through the book that the reader had been told at the beginning. The descriptions of clothes, jewelry and homes were repetitious, too. Yuck. <br />I can't believe people enjoy these kinds of books. This one was not only mindless, but a giant cliche. John O'Hara does this kind of society thing much better. Read &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot; instead.	2003-12-01

Beautiful but simple writing, interesting time shifts, deeply understood characters... The writer who said the woman was a wimp should remember that this book took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s in a rural area, and that the woman was an immigrant. The descriptions of the artist's works were also wonderful. I highly recommend this book and intend to check out Watson's other novels.	2003-11-21

The story of Train, an Afro-American golf caddie, is excellently told. The other two characters are less well-rounded. Is Packard really a police sergeant? He seems to work only part-time, if that. I couldn't get a real reading on him. And Norah. The description of what happens to her is almost too awful to read. I feel that Dexter invented her as a pivot to connect Packard and Train.<br />I think the plot lost steam as Packard began taking Train to play golf for money. Dexter tried to tie it all up in the end, but the novel lost its focus in my opinion. Who is the lead character afterall? I finished the book feeling up in the air about what I am supposed to think.<br />As for Train, why is he so tied to Plural? I guess he'll just go on as best he can. The descriptions of him and his dog tugged at my heart. Being inside Train's head is a wonderful experience. But readers who want a more well rounded Dexter book should go for his novel &quot;Paris Trout.&quot; That is a real winner.	2003-11-16

Subtitle to this book is &quot;daydreaming and smoking around America with interruptions.&quot; The author travels by freighter from England to the U.S., then around the edges of the U.S. by train. She talks to people and records their conversations, most of which take place in the trains' smoking sections. None of them are particularly interesting. I read the whole book, but found it narcisistic (she admits she's a narcisist) full of tales about her days in English mental institutions, and not that entertaining. PLUS: get her an editor - please. It's Willie Mays, not Willie May. It's St.Paul-Minneapolis, not St. Paul's-Minneapolis. And the Mississippi river is certainly not in North Dakota. Then there are the English usages. What are pilchards? What is a tannoy? One person she meets says what he'd like to do with his life is &quot;mess about on boats.&quot; No American would say that. If you want to read a good travel book, stick to Paul Theroux. If you want an interesting memoir look elsewhere.	2003-11-15

This adds nothing to the genre and is pretentious besides. The girl is a complete cipher and the main character, Charles, is maudlin at best. Why are we being told this mundane story?

She let the men in her life put her down, prevent her from painting and generally treat her like dirt. I got really tired of her whining. The style of this book -- a long interview of Hope by a young journalist -- means the reader is stuck in Hope's head, hearing her thoughts, memories, comments to the interviewer and thoughts about the interviewer.<br />First, I didn't believe a 27-year old interviewer would be doing this interview and know as much as she did. Second, I didn't believe Hope would accept an interview for an online publication she knew nothing about. Third, the interviewer was totally opaque. I had no way of knowing anything about her and her personality kept changing depending on what Updike wanted to show about Hope. Too contrived.<br />If you want to know about artists in the 20th century, read a biography of Jackson Pollack or one of the others. Don't read this trumped up creation. What a mess. And a bore. <br />If you want to read Updike, there are many Updike books that I found fascinating and impressive, Couples for one, the Rabbit series. But not this one -- I didn't read the last 10 pages. I simply could not plow through them after all the repetition.	2003-01-15

I am assuming they are accurate, although I have no way of knowing. English countryside descriptions reminded me of Thomas Hardy, which is a compliment to the author.<br />However, the plot and characters were stereotypes. The long-suffering wife, the over-sexed lower class girl, the unattractive scholarly girl and the lovelorn dreamy girl, not to mention the hardworking farmer and his brooding, handsome son, are all the stuff of romance novels. I never felt close to the girls, believed in their friendship or really cared what happened to them. I got really tired of and repelled by the over-sexed girl's exploits, and the others' whining. <br />So why did I finish the book? Well, I bought it instead of taking it out of the library, my usual book venue. There was some tension about which girl would get her man. But the ending!! Who could believe that? Ridiculous.	2003-01-04

The writing was excellent and the descriptions of minor characters like the people who own the Scottish Terriers, clear and precise. However, I didn't really understand Theresa's motivations for her actions, nor did I get that delicious gut feeling that I got reading Elizabeth Berg's novels about a girl around this age. Those are really heartstring tugging. I suppose McDermott wants to take a cooler approach and more distant. My other problem with this book is that summer days are inevitably repetitious, which made the book repetitious.<br />I also do not believe for a moment that a 15-year old girl would remain naked under a blanket tent on a busy beach for even a millisecond.	2002-12-21

I missed the descriptions of her home and habits that are sometimes TOO detailed in other mysteries of this type. I have no idea what her house is like, what kinds of clothes she wears, etc. Also, I just did not believe what she was able to accomplish and how much wool she pulled over how many eyes. Also, I prefer when these types of books are in first person. I could then really be in Jane's head and hear her thoughts. Also, a bit too much scenery description. So overall, despite the entertaining and clever plot and the strong, unusual setting, I don't think I'll be reading another da Silva mystery.	2002-12-19

This book, written before the memoire, covers much of the same territory, but the effort to turn what clearly are parts of Fox's own life into fiction doesn't work all that well. I had to laugh when I discovered Fox giving her own childhood to one of the characters.  <br />All of the characters in &quot;The God of Nightmares&quot; are weird in one way or another, except the main character, Helen, who tells the story. She seems pretty ordinary until the last chapter when Fox tries to show us Helen isn't so nice after all. I didn't like this last chapter, which takes place more than 25 years after the main story. Fox tries too hard to tie things up and tell us what happened to each of her characters. I was especially irritated by the way she changed the husband -- but I won't say more about that as it comes as something of a surprise.	2002-11-27

The writing was excellent and I liked the basic idea of the novel, but it didn't hold my attention. The plot and characters simply were not compelling enough to pull me forward through 500 pages. I think there is a certain egocentricity to authors (male) who write big books like this one. THEY are interested in everything they say, so we readers should be, too. I prefer a novel like Carol Shields &quot;Unless.&quot; At around 200 pages, it never flagged and the author didn't stuff it with extraneous details, historical oddities or long digressions.	2002-11-19

So many writers born when I was (1946) think readers want to know what went on in their youths. Boring. Harriet is a pain in the neck, the other women are stereotypical.

The author asks and answers questions: Why do women find themselves as muses to great men? Why do these men find their muses inspiring? How do these couples interact, infuriate each other, stay together, break apart?<br />I particularly enjoyed reading about Hester Thrale and the other 19th century muses because of the &quot;period&quot; color in the descriptions. In one review I read, the reviewer chastised Prose for telling these anti-feminist tales, but taken in context, the tales make sense. Many of these muses were not allowed by society to become artists on their own just because of the times in which they lived. Being muses served as their creative outlet.<br />All in all, a fascinating work.	2002-10-24

Rather than telling a story, she's written a polemic - a soft diatribe against people who hate people because they are different in some way. The writing is good, but the whole thing is stiff and the events repetitive.<br />The main character, Harriet, makes friends way too easily. Her bookstore is a hit, which I believe, and Harriet's mourning of her lost lover who died recently is also realistic. <br />Another problem is I couldn't tell when the book was supposed to take place. Harriet and another guy (a doctor) were smoking cigarettes! Also she seemed stuck in the 1940s with her friend Angelica Lamb (what a stupid and obvious name) who has a maid who cooks dinner for her!<br />Overall the book is just not a good novel.	2002-09-28

The story moves along, the dialogue is real, and the characters are well drawn. The plot is a bit hackneyed, but so what? There just aren't any truly new mystery plots.

The events and characters are so real. I'm having difficulty putting my feelings about this book into words. It's as if the book existed without an author; her presence is nowhere felt, but everything that happens in the book is intensely true. I was particularly touched by the ending. <br />I enjoyed Harrison's book &quot;The Binding Chair,&quot; too, but it was more realistic and more obviously &quot;written.&quot; This one seems dreamed.	2002-07-15

No flowery writing to get in the way. Real characters. A narrator who let us readers in on her thoughts and didn't keep secrets just for the sake of confusing us. A book with ethical issues that weren't spelled out, but nevertheless were clear. It wasn't overly complicated and obfuscated, and at the same time it didn't hit the reader over the head with a message. The characters will stay with me for a long time.	2002-07-11
US	38072485	RFI8TJFZ2LBTV	0312420196	85872492	Border Crossing: A Novel	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Bland	Barker's WWI saga was fantastic. The characters were real and their problems intense. By contrast this book was bland. I never really cared about them, and even though the book was just 200 pages, I could barely finish it. I never really got a grip on Danny, the child criminal. Was he evil? Or just a troubled kid? What was I supposed to conclude?<br />The book is told from the point of view of Tom, the therapist. I have a real problem with four or five pages in the middle of the book when the reader is suddenly in the head of a different character. How come? Was this an editing mistake? It contributes nothing to the book. I simply don't understand what it's doing there.	2002-07-07

At least five times you used \\"lay\\" when the correct grammar is \\"lie.\\" And this was not in dialogue. Page 199: \\"He was laying on the ground.\\" More than once you slipped from the past tense into the present. Page 229: \\"My mother looked like she knew better, but she didn't say anything. By the end of the night we'll have a fresh batch of cookies, and she'll have done all the ironing.\\" Other errors: Page 257: Stephanie's niece is incorrectly identified as \\"Annie.\\" Also, page 303: Stephanie suddenly has a speakerphone in her kitchen. Since when? Who has speaker phones at home? And if she did, wouldn't I know it after eight books?<br />Those are my editorial comments. About the story: 200 pages of nonsense and not a single laugh. Reading the first few books, I literally fell off the couch laughing. Lula never said \\"damn skippy.\\" There was no \\"hide the salami,\\" and nothing equal to replace those two.<br />I still like Morelli, but Ranger is a stiff (no pun intended). The plot was wrapped up in three horrific pages. I don't want to see Stephanie and her sister tortured. Think of a better way out of the corner you are painted into.<br />Try harder next time. You are making big bucks and getting lots of media attention. You owe it to your readers to produce a top notch product.	2002-07-03

I was a bit skeptical of the closeness that developed so quickly between her and those she met, but I decided there were others whom she met with whom she didn't develop closeness and therefore didn't bother to mention. <br />I was disturbed by some editing mistakes, all of the same type: &quot;Our guide was a smart, formidable Australian woman....When separated from the group by crowd or a tendency to malinger at a shop window, her long neck and elegant head bobbing above the thronging tourists proved a reliable compass.&quot; Steinbach means that when SHE HERSELF was separated from the group, but what the sentence says instead is when the guide's LONG NECK AND ELEGANT HEAD were separated from the group. There are several sentences of this mistaken variety in the book. I find them distracting and they make me wonder about Steinbach's skill as a newspaper columnist.<br />And MALINGER! That means to pretend illness, not to stop in front of a shop window. Is it possible that no one who edited this book noticed it should be linger?<br />Anyhow, I did enjoy this book and hated to see it end. I plan to read more of Steinbach's writing when it appears.	2002-07-02

Most are good, some are great, a few are not quite up to par. But this one definitely stunk. Instead of a tightly written 200 pages, it was 300 repetitious, boring pages. The main character was a cipher and his \\"love interest,\\" a married woman, just happens to become free at the very end of the book. How contrived can you get? Prior to that, in the last 60 or so pages Francis lived up to his best plotting self, although the main character's near death experience was not original. Oh well. I bought it for 50 cents at a book sale and wasted only a few hours reading it, so I can't really complain.	2002-06-30

I picked this up because I was going on a trip and it was long - 930 pages to be exact. I assumed it would be about Eleanor and her relationship with Franklin, not about him, and I was right. I really enjoyed reading about her childhood and young aduldhood. I never realized what an amazing person she was and how much she had to overcome. <br />Yes, there were chapters in this book that I read with a somewhat dazed attention as they included far too many details about far too many people whom I had never heard of. But even in those chapters, Eleanor's light kept me reading.<br />Highly recommended for its revelation of an extremely important American woman.	2002-06-09
US	38072485	R18M4ZRRW9KTXE	0374232105	804365556	The Pickup	Books	5	22	26	N	N	Highly atmospheric; left me close to tears	This book is very subtle and beautiful. The carefully detailed explanation of the relationship that grows and changes between Julie and Abdu is exquisite. The interactions of Julie and her family, and then the quietly growing connections Julie makes in Abdu's desert family, the roots she puts down when she had no anchors until then, are described to perfection. The end of the book is inevitable, once you know it. But although I gradually came to accept and understand it, I am left after reading the last few pages with an ache in my chest for all of the characters.<br />My only complaint is that some of Gordimer's sentences are so tortured and indecipherable I had to read them three times before I could figure them out. Now what's that about? Does she mean for the sentences to be that convoluted? Is this due to bad editing? I know it's not me, as I have read many so-called &quot;difficult&quot; authors: among them Nabokov, Lessing various Russians, Japanese etc. Gordimer is writing in English, my native language, for heaven's sake. <br />BUT---nevertheless I strongly recommend this atmospheric, evocative, painful novel.	2002-04-25
US	38072485	R2XVRN7AY1CRO2	B000062UHX	184600193	Never Change	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Contrived and saccharine - I liked it anyhow!	The set up is completely unbelievable - a 51-year old guy with the ridiculous name of Chip, comes home to die and Myra, a girl who had a crush on him in high school, just happens to be his visiting nurse. Big surprise - they fall in love despite his being a dream boat and her a dog. <br />What saves this from being a maudlin piece is Berg's ability to make her characters real. Even though I didn't believe the plot for a minute, I believed that the characters were real people. Berg's attention to detail is excellent. Her character's voices and observations, and what they say to one another are true. That's why I truly enjoyed this book. <br />But I won't give Berg a five. Recently I heard a story of hers read aloud. It had all the positive points of this book, but it was sophisticated, funny and deep. I want her to write a book with more depth. She can do it. She has plenty of cash now from the sale of all these sappy books. Come on, Liz. Give us a piece of literature.	2002-04-20
US	38072485	R843SMNTC63HM	0393050475	805494676	Grand Ambition: A Novel	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Extremely enjoyable; just a couple of quibbles	I thought the characters in this book were drawn extremely well, including Glen's father, Reith. I didn't know how it would end and was held by the suspense throughout. Although there were many scenes of the couple going through river rapids, each was different, very well described and held me rapt.<br />Now for the quibbles: There are three voices in this book, Bessie, Glen and Reith, yet a few times the author slips out of those points of view into the heads of minor characters such as the bookstore owner for whom Bessie works and the man who briefly travels with them on the river. These are both jarring and unnecesary. My other quibble is that the author uses the word &quot;since&quot; when she means &quot;because.&quot; <br />But overall, I recommend this highly, especially to anyone who has spent time out west.	2002-03-23

They were quirky enough to be interesting and I liked the way Thompson worked the plot around them. Then she brought in Rolando, a crazy mixed up Hispanic. I knew something bad was going to happen and I didn't like it. I think Thompson wanted to write about the first three people and their lives, but couldn't figure out how to make the novel stay entertaining and come out right. She set these three characters in motion, then realized she didn't have a clue as to what would happen in the end, so she added a &quot;bad guy&quot; for excitement and a big conclusion. I didn't like how easily everyone's problems were solved including the bad guy's. The ending was too neat a package with everyone all lovey-dovey.	2002-03-09

It's not supposed to be a deep character study or a search for reasons and answers. It is an evocation of a child's life, bits and pieces she remembers because of their impact. I think it was beautifully written. That the parents were irresponsible is without question, but finding out why they were or how they should have been punished isn't the point.	2002-03-05

But then the book took a \\"left\\" turn into Africa and the predictable story of corrupt rulers, starving villagers and AIDS. <br />The novel had no forward motion. Events happened. People grew older and did whatever they did. But there was no real plot. I had the feeling Lessing, who must be in her eighties, simply wanted to get all of this down on paper before she died.	2002-03-03

I must admit I read only 100 pages. I enjoyed the beginning, when Halpern traveled to Mexico, but after page 100 the book was too academic, filled with the points of view of various monarch afficionados. Pretty dull stuff. I didn't think the writing was all that great, either. I suppose it was an academic success, but it didn't draw me in to the adventure.	2002-02-08

I have no idea. Jack's life is orderly and traditional. Ben, a ..survivor, finds love and rejects it. Jack knows all through reading Ben's journal and because Ben tells him all at their occasional lunches. <br />I just didn't get this book. I've read three others by Begley. All were excellent, told believable stories, had interesting characters and satisfying conclusions. I finished this one only because I started it. <br />Also, there is way too much male fantasy [stuff]. How many scenes of anonymous or paid for intercourse must a reader witness to get the point? And I am certainly tired of \\"beautiful\\" but problematic women and the repetitive descriptions of ..[them]. Enough already!<br />Many sharp details do not a novel make. If you want to sample Begley, read \\"About Schmidt.\\"	2002-01-29

The characters are real and the main character's interactions with them believable. Then, suddenly the book changes to an entirely different location (from London to Africa), the main character becomes an observer, rather than an actor, in events, and I became bored and annoyed. Why was I being told the long, complicated stories of these Portuguese/Africans? What did the main character's life among them have to do with his prior life in London? How could it be that a man who wrote and published a collection of short stories as a young man, would never be writing again? Extremely unlikely. So, in the end, I was disappointed. And I thought the very end was a cop out. The main character is telling his African story ostensibly to his sister in Germany. Although we see her as he begins his tale, she disappears. Where is she at the end? Is he still in Germany? I think that winning the Nobel Prize doesn't let you off the hook for owing your readers satisfaction.	2002-01-27

I have tried one Bill Smith book and found I could not relate to the main character. Here is a book that includes both P.I.s, although it focuses mostly on Lydia. I enjoyed the Hong Kong setting, but grew bored with the continuous descriptions of the neon lights reflected in the water. The plot was well done. I actually understood all the twists and turns. The editing on this book was poor: several typos plus two minor plot mistakes. I am tired of Lydia's dithering about whether she loves Bill. I am also not convinced a man like Bill would continue to pine for a &quot;girl&quot; like Lydia. I would have been much more entertained if Lydia had fallen for the Hong Kong cop, Mark. That would have been believable, natural and would have been a turning point in this long drawn out relationship with Bill. Speaking of long and drawn out, this book was too long. A mystery hardcover rarely rates more than 250 pages. I feel strongly that authors are asked to add filler so that publishers can charge more for the longer books. Maybe that's where all those descriptions come in. Oh well, I must have liked it. I read the last 100 pages in 2 hours straight.	2002-01-20
