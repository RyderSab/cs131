All it does it make you even more obsessed with food, and now even sugars in fruits are bad!  I don't like the strictly outlined nutritional program--I don't think that works for people who &quot;can't stop eating&quot;.  I know that strictly outlined nutritional programs don't work for me.  I know from personal experience that most of the time when people can't stop eating, someone giving you a new list of things you can't eat isn't going to help much.  All this book did was make me feel more helpless in the face of my binge-eating disorder.	2003-04-07

This man named Scobie, so honest and always well-meaning, always craving peace from his self-created hell.  Always he feels pity for the women he once loved, and out of the pity grows a sense of responsibility, an intense desire for them to be happy.  In the end this is too much for him.	2002-09-28

I was given this book as a gift, and loosely familiar with Anne Rice's work as a sort of mainstream author, I was shocked by the material within.<BR>Rice delves within the psychological process of b&d and sub/dom quite well, making it far more than purely a lustful thing, rather a situation of perfect release and simplicity.

This one made a big one--why?  Because it is written backwards.  As in, there is a foreign mind in a certain man's head who travels with him in the reverse of his life.  It sounds a little complex, but it's really not.  The way this other man without a body (who is only a visitor in this man's brain) views the world is entirely in reverse.  People walk backwards.  Doctors make people sick (because they are all stitched up when they leave, and bloody when they come in, and this is shown in reverse).<BR>The book is about a mostly overdone topic--the Holocaust.  However, this &quot;backwards&quot; approach freshens it up a bit and makes it all the more real somehow.  The mass murders and hidious mutilations of the body in the concentration camps are viewed by the narrator as a sort of creation, because in the reverse view the Nazi's take hold of the dead bodies, or the ashes, and make them into live humans again.<BR>While I was reading the book it was a little difficult to keep remembering that things were happening in the reverse.  When I took breaks from reading my sense of time was a little distorted, as I kept thinking in reverse(even when not reading the book).  This book is certainly worth it if you want something to change your perceptions on the world a little.	2001-12-24

When his aunt naively praises the company for its \\"charitable ambitions\\", he gently corrects her, informing her that it is in fact a company fun for profit.

Love is a study on aging, sexuality, death, and the corruption of society which is what &quot;cholera&quot; is a metaphor for.

Reading several of the other reviews, I found many people complained of the lengthiness and description.  I have no complaints.  After all, how is the average reader who is not an expert in medieval England going to understand what is going on unless White tells us?  I loved the fact that White was so researched and was able to back up his story so that it became more an accurate account of history than a will-o-the-wisp fairy-tale.<BR>This is the first Arthurian book I've really read, and I've fallen in love with this vision of simple nobility and honor.  Arthur, Guenever, Lancalot, Merlyn, Gawaine . . . White made them so human I felt great surges of emotion while reading.<BR>If you are impatient and want things to be spelled out for you rather than requiring you to think (as Merlyn tried to steer Arthur away from in the book) then you probably won't enjoy this book.  It probably wouldn't appeal to the younger sort.  However, if you enjoy reading and thinking you will adore this book.	2001-11-01

There is such hope tinged with sadness at the end when Arthur imagines he sees Merlyn.  Arthur was such a lovely happy boy and such a kind simple man, ravaged by the sorrows of evil done unto him  by man.  I adore the nobility of dear King Arthur and infinitely sweet Sir Lancalot with the ugly face.<BR>Also, it is interesting to note that T. H. White really researched this novel!  He truly validated it and turned it into a true historical account rather than fairy-tale fiction.  This book made me want to read more of T. H. White's works.	2001-11-01

Because of this he views life in an entirely different way.  &quot;Thou art God&quot; which includes complete &quot;grokking&quot; of people, things, everything.  Discorporation (death) is not to be mourned--only serenely accepted.  Mike has a fine little community of people who have been taught his way of grokking.  It is so right.  Here is a chance for happiness on a mass scale it seems.  Heinlein is brilliant; this is the best book I've read in a long while.

I wonder whether Shelley intended the pallid ineffectual women of Frankenstein to be irony? Showing how men expect women to be mirrors of their narcaccistic selves. Point made, but I personally am not amused. However, this book is wonderful in providing an in-depth analysis of Shelley's own emotions. She had an illigetimate marriage and illigetimate children while living in an unforgiving society. When going out in public she felt ostrasized, like a monster perhaps. Aha! The idea for Frankenstein was born out of her own isolation. Victor repulses me with his weak excuses and selfishness when it came down to saving Justine. Throughout the entire novel there is an obsession with the class system and beauty. The characters that aren't wealthy and of a privileged birth are less worthy as human beings. Elizabeth was adopted because of her beauty alone; the other peasant children were ignored. I suppose this book reflected the concerns of the nineteenth century almost perfectly	2001-08-27

Very convincing to the naive--I could even feel the persuasion tugging at my mind. However, I feel the characters are too cold. Big business is glorified unrealistically and altruism is spit upon. The virtue of altruism is certainly exaggerated but it shouldn't be spit upon. If someone gives a starving child on the street a piece of bread, should this person be chastised. yet this is altruism. I say everything in moderation, and Randists go too far in one direction.	2001-08-27

I was impressed.  Though the plot would seem shallow now (it centers around marriages); then that was central to most women's hopes and desires.  Besides the plot, the characters are amusing and Elizabeth is finely drawn.  She is very self-confidant and will not allow others to look down on her for her ill upbringing.  I don't believe men would enjoy this book, because the male figure is not drawn very realistically.  I seriously doubt that all men thought or talked about were marriage and love.  Walter Raleigh phrased it correctly by saying that &quot;Austen's men wouldn't be allowed in any club in England!&quot;.  I didn't find it to be at all boring, rather, a page-turner to see how everything was going to turn out (though in the end it became predictable).  The formal language is confusing at times, but provides a bit more color with it's detail. Though many parts of the book are obviously contrived, and I feel as if Austen is trying a little too hard to invoke emotion within me, in many ways the book is ahead of it's time, and for that, it is commendable to be certain.	2000-12-21

How could they discard their taught social characteristics so easily?  What also left an impression on me was Ralph... at the first of the book he was pliant to the whims of the mob, pleasure-seeking and immature.  By the end he is a leader who laments the loss of innocence and reason. I guess, though I don't usually like books with so much description of the foliage, the reason it is such a worthy book is that I will remember it...
