If you were baffled and outraged by the U.S. Supreme Court's role in deciding the presidential election of 2000 with its controversial ruling in Bush v. Gore your not alone. There are millions. Legal expert Alan M. Dershowitz addresses this controversy head-on. Dershowitz argues that in this case for the first time, the court's majority let its desire for a particular partisan outcome have priority over legal principles. Dershowitz goes on to say that the involvement of the court has severely compromised the Court's role in national affairs. The Court he says once had held a unique place in our system of checks and balances; it is now seen as a decision maker that reeks of partisan politics. No matter what your opinion is about who won or who lost this book brings you good insight to one of Americas leading legal minds and takes us on a step-by-step journey in one of Nations most controversial decisions.<br />FinancialNeeds.com	2001-08-02

This book is aimed at totally restructuring your diet. The book starts off by dismantling the USDA Food Pyramid that we all learn back in elementary school. The author blames many of the pyramid's recommendations, 6 to 11 servings of carbohydrates, all fats used sparingly for much of the current wave of obesity. He also points out and to keep in mind about the USDA Pyramid is that it comes from the Department of Agriculture; the agency responsible for promoting American agriculture, not from the agencies established to monitor and protect our health. It's no wonder that dairy products and American-grown grains such as wheat and corn figure so prominently in the USDA's recommendations. So what the author does is create a new pyramid for us. Tells us by eating more vegetables and complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and enjoy small amounts of a tremendous variety of food, we will be healthier. This book offers eye-opening new research on the healthiest forms of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and the relative importance of various food groups and supplements. The book shows you a far easier and healthier way to eat than the USDA Food Pyramid route. <br />FinancialNeeds.com	2001-07-31

In Maine, she ends up working as both a cleaning woman and a nursing home assistant where she must first fill out endless pre-employment tests with trick questions not to help you but to screw you.

Where civil liberties are quite often ignored and hard work fails to live up to its name as the way out of poverty. In her travels she also discovers that no job is truly unskilled, that every job requires exhausting mental and muscular effort.

The content in this book is something that every American should be familiar with next time you drive up at a fast food chain. This book is a deep investigation that reaches its frightening peak in the meatpacking plants. Where you have an almost complete lack of federal oversight of a seemingly lawless industry. Fast food customers should be informed of what goes on in that \\"happy\\" meal from beginning to end. <br />The author takes us all behind the counter where overworked and underpaid teenage workers struggle with low morale and onto the factory farms where the potatoes and beef are grown, and into the slaughterhouses run by giant meatpacking corporations. What I find most disturbing and disgusting is his description of how the industry \\"feeds off the young\\" while leaving them prone to obesity and disease. The fast food industry has become a disgrace as we have become the most obese nation in the world. <br />In closing I would like to warmly thank Eric Schlosser for the guts he had to write such a wonderful book. His work has caused me to reject the fast food industry in its entirety as I will no longer support these arrogant corporate giants. My family and I have chosen to stay away from fast food altogether. We refuse to lose by getting blinded by the commercials on TV or their proliferation in our neighborhoods. This is a shocking, fact filled book that every American should read. The truth is there is nothing happy in your happy meal!...	2001-07-26

Those without the stomach for this kind of true story should be warned that there will be restaurant horror stories that involve heavy drinking, drugs, sex in the dry-goods area, unappetizing and appalling industry-wide practices from some of the best-rated hotels and restaurants. <br />The book tells you why you probably shouldn't order fish on a Monday, why those who favor well done steaks and burgers get the scrapings from the bottom of the barrel, and why seafood frittata is not such a wise Sunday brunch selection. This book reveals what goes on behind the kitchen doors while you&#8217;re \\"enjoying\\" your meal. From the restaurants of Tokyo to the drug dealers of the East Village, from the mobsters to the rats, wild-but-true tales make the belly ache with both laughter and sadness.

Everyone in business thinks they really know their customers and what they want? Today's customers are leading a revolution against business as usual: They are demanding that companies recognize them as individuals NOT numbers and conduct business on their terms. These terms lead to new Marketing methods.<br />The Myth of Excellence breaks down marketing methods into five attributes: access, experience, price, product, and service. The book argues that successful businesses are those that excel in one of these areas, are good in another, and are at least average in the rest. The book tries to answer two vital questions: What do customers really want? And how can companies best serve them? They use examples of how Wal-Mart, dominants on price and maintains a good selection of products, while Target excels at product selection and makes price its secondary. Like the undiscovered country companies are finding out a new type of consumer, one whom very few companies understand, much less manufacture products for or sell products or services to and leads into the \\"Myth of Excellence.\\"<br />A tour de force!
