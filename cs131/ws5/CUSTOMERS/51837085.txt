There are more managers than directors.  In contrast, there are more books for the high level managers than the book for lower level managers.  The &quot;Managing Up&quot; is the book for lower level manager, written for managing upper level.  Rosanne (the author) wrote about her 14 year experience as executive assistant for Jack Welch.  So, you can feel GE environment from one page to another, e.g., Work-out program.  Although Rosanne mentions that, we are all managers as well as secretary, many places in the book are involved for more assistant rather than management.  Many chapters I need to read it twice to see the points that author would like to make, even though there are the conclusion for each chapter.<BR>The first star is from the book for lower level to mange up.  The second star is from summary of each chapter.  However, the viewpoint of this book is too narrow for reality.  I would encourage the author not to stop her career in writing but to make it valuable by look at wider perspective.	2004-02-08

The soft-skill is about people and how to manage them.  This skill is obvious in several text and business management book.  The hard-skill, however, is quite rare.  Fortunately, Wright combines it in nice -easy to read format.<BR>The strong point of this book is &quot;comprehensive&quot;.  Wright composes his thought of manufacturing system today and projected to the future.  All manufacturing processes are seamlessly combined from one chapter to another.  The integration of CAD/CAM is also mentioned.  In addition, his viewpoint of manufacturing system for biotechnology, nanotechnology and information technology are quite interesting -and practical. <BR>If I have to use one book for manufacturing class, I would use this book for teaching.  For anyone new to manufacturing process, this book is a must for your jorney to the manufacturing world.	2003-10-26

The prophecy is based on \\"number\\", the important number, after long-hour research.  Those important numbers point to the upcoming future.  You'll be amazed, confused or even scared how close the future is and how cruel it will be.  Again, this is the \\"work-of-art\\" book.  You can finish reading in hours but you will spend week (or month) to think about what you see.  I'm not sure if Professor Enriques put effort on \\"recognition\\" to make reader \\"think\\" after read his book.  It works well with me anyway.<BR>One weakness I see, however, is the way to present statistics.  While I love many statistical numbers presented, many of them are irrelevant or not fit the story well.  Maybe the author over estimates the readers to follow this deep thinking so he skipped many parts -leaving reader miserable.<BR>Overall, this book is requirement for all futurism or anyone who will live tomorrow!	2002-12-31

The research was conducted based on &quot;food resturant chain&quot; but the deduction (including the book title) seems to cover every franchise business.  Is it possible that the research results for restuarant business only?  We don't know.  The research validation of the author still questionable to me. <BR>The selected companies are too subjective, still.  Several questions raised while I read the book about other franchise companies that the author didn't select.  Although the author indicate three criteria (see research design of the book) to conduct the research, there is no mention to other companies that the author didn't choose.<BR>This book is quite comprehensive but it can be one of the best reference book if the author go more detail (and change the title) for food restuarant business and add more detail about his research design.	2002-12-05

How so? Let we think in this way.  What is the &quot;news&quot;?  News is a story of &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot;.  In this case, this is a very good, a good book.<BR>O'Connor and McDermott comprehensively compile the story of &quot;Systems Thinking&quot; in a story-teller format.  I trust you realize the important of &quot;system&quot; or &quot;thinking&quot; since you are reading my review.  For any other &quot;system&quot; book, you might be afraid of highly mathematics or several jagons.  Many times you may see the books on &quot;systems&quot; are more too much on &quot;technical aspect&quot;.  For readers in &quot;thinking&quot; books, you might experience the chaotic writing or too much philosophy (than practice).  For those who are interested in &quot;Systems Thinking&quot;, you might already experience highly differential equation that you already returned to your teachers.<BR>So what O'Connor and McDermott did on this small book?  They tell us a story of &quot;System&quot; and &quot;System Thinking&quot;.  Several examples are presented in different fields, mostly on daily life; making this book more readable.  While O'Connor and McDermott tell us a &quot;Systems Thinking&quot; story, the &quot;content&quot; of &quot;Systems Thinking&quot; is not lessen.  All technical terms that you fear from &quot;Systems Dynamics&quot; are delineated in human-readable-words.  For example, instead of the author tell us about the derivative of y with respect to x, the authors use the word &quot;flow&quot; and describe it facing the word &quot;level&quot;.<BR>Each main section are very enjoyable to read, with summary.  I personally like Chapter 2 the most.  Chapter 2 shows me the different way to think about diferential equation application to the world.  The last part of this book is the history and reference in Systems Thinking, which I strongly recommend any one to read it.  <BR>Personally, I recommend this book for every one interested in &quot;Systems&quot;, &quot;Thinking&quot; and &quot;Systems Thinking&quot;.  Although you are a serious mathematician, you may want to discover the new perspective to the world.  This can be the first book for novice Systems Thinker as well as companion book for serious Systems Thinker.	2001-12-07

Although there are two other books, this book is small (not thick) enough to finish by a month or less.  However, it can't be judge by the book size.  This book is comprehensive for its content.  I personally like the first chapter for its genuine introduction.  THe author (Reeves) requires no background to read the first chapter -as I let my girlfriend reads it with no difficulty.  The definition and short history of &quot;heuristics&quot; made the first chapter is very interesting.  For other chapters, the metaheuristics are well described.  The good thing about the book is, you will read the same format through out the book.  Therefore, you can make comparison for each metaheuristics without any problem.  This is the well-done book.	2001-09-16

Now I need to seriously study the Risk analysis for the ERP implementation for the real-business and I found this book is quite useful.  Comparing to the Risk management book, this book gives you more quantitative analysis using simulation approach.  Hence, this book will guide you for more tangible subject rather than intangible subject.<BR>I agree with other reviewer for the &quot;student version&quot; of the software, come with this book.

This book is intended for both practitioners and students, and I found it serves its objectives. Starting with the definition, advantages/disadvantages, implementation, strategic integration, Information Technology (IT), business process, managing Supply Chain with ERP, and future of ERP in organization.  The topics are the most popular questions in ERP decision, implementation, and continuous improvement. I would rate this book at five stars; however, there are something that I put four stars for this book -as follows: 1) Although the topics are hot and referred to many business cases, the organization of each chapter is terrible.  I got lost several times in chapter or between chapters.  2) Each chapter referes back-and-forth to other chapters, which is quite useful for further reference.  I, however, found they are too many referals.  Again, this makes almost every chapters are not much different than others. Except for the book organization, this book is quite good for its content.  I wish Davenport may consider to re-organize the second edition of this book or his new book.  His knowledge in this area is exceptional, only it's required lots of organized.  This book offers many excellent points of &quot;after-ERP&quot;, which is rarely found in most ERP books.  Good but not great book.  Therefore, this is not the single book if you plan to get only one.  You may consider O'Leary's book (ISBN 0521791529) or Brady et al. (ISBN 0619015934), if you are new to ERP and get Davenport's book for supplement.	2001-05-07

I bought this book to see research in educational or social science on impat of high school students choosing their higher education. After reading &quot;preface&quot;, I was stunned for the research had been conducted for &quot;9&quot; years! This book is very important for any parents. The college may be for your children at 17-18, but this book will tell you how important you are to support them; not only when they go to College but much before (e.g., sixth grade). I'm glad I read this book before I have my own child. What more surprising me is the book organization. This book was well written and organized. The structure is easy to follow. For each case study, the conclusion was drawn. Their research factors/questions were well defined.  I wasn't surprised to see the outcome of their research.  What annoy me is the keeping-talking of statistics tool.  While it's important, the writing and research are more important. It's quite disappointed me.	2001-04-25

Four sections are Modeling, Soft Management Science, Math modeling and Model accessment/validation. The modeling section is the &quot;thinking-work&quot;, which you would love it if you like Ackoff's or Simon's works.  The soft management science section is the way to &quot;really solve&quot; the problem not using hard-core mathematics. One chapter of soft management science section is dedicated to System Dynamics, which Pidd did really well in the presentation way.  The math-modeling section has three chapters, i.e., LP, Simulation (discrete-event), and Heuristics. The LP and discrete-event simulation can be found in most OR books, but not the heuristics.  In this book, Pidd summarized three major metaheuristics (i.e., Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms) in a simple manner.  The forth section is the second-best in this book, since not many OR books talk about the model accessment and validation.  While most OR books view validation in terms of sensitivity analysis, Pidd presented the validation in his way and I like it a lot. In short, almost all areas of Operations Research and Management Science are compiled in this book -quite comprehensive.  Each issues were addressed from the history and used the simple message with illustrations.  It's not easy to find the complete work presented in this way. The missing issues are Artificial Intelligent (AI), Expert System, and Neural Networks, which I didn't see him mentioned in his book.  However, this book itself is very well comprehensive -although it's only 350 pages.  I strongly recommend this book as the first book in OR or MS, or any reference book for grad students who's interested in this area.  It can be used either the first reference or further study after your school life.   Pidd is a professor at Lancaster U. in UK so US students may not be familiar with his name.  Interest readers may go to [...] andsee further information about him and his research on his homepage though.	2001-04-20

Edwards or Oracle books in the market, only few books were really written in &quot;ERP context&quot;.  Fortunately, this book is one of few.<br />The teaching experience told Brady and Monk that &quot;teaching SAP application&quot; to business students was not sufficient to make students understand the &quot;concept of ERP&quot;.  This is the impression for them to write this book.  The foundation of ERP are addressed in business process perspectives; and then, mapped to the ERP process.  One &quot;BIG&quot; case-study is used to describe the ERP component, with respect to SAP R/3 system.  However, the fundamental is not limited to SAP package since extensions are also provided.  <br />The uniqueness of this book is the combination of &quot;O'Leary's book (ISBN 0521791529)&quot; and &quot;Jacobs &amp; Whybark (ISBN 0072400897)&quot;.  Like &quot;Why ERP? by Jacobs and Whybark&quot;, Brady and Monk use a single case study to describe the ERP in &quot;formal format&quot; (not in novel as Why ERP).  Like &quot;O'Leary's book&quot;, this book gives the fundamental to understand ERP rather than &quot;implementation of specific package&quot;.  <br />Unlike &quot;Why ERP&quot;, this book is the formal textbook, very easy to read textbook, not a novel.  Unlike &quot;O'Leary's book&quot;, this book is the explanation of ERP and interaction of business process, instead of implemenation and outline.  <br />Another major advantage of this book is the easy-well-written is in 200 pages.  Graduate students or passion-readers may finish it in one night.  This book is also good for ERP introduction (1-3 meetings) for any Production/Operation Management classes or Supply Chain Management.<br />One thing that I'd like to see more is the &quot;reference&quot;.  While this book is quite comprehensive, the reference are limited to the CIO ([...] instead of many existed publications.  I wish the authors would do more research in this area andput additional reference in the context in the next edition.	2001-04-19

In this book, Freeman applied the &quot;visual design&quot; through the framing and composing technique -the art of seeing.  Unlike other photo books, this book shows you more on composition of shape and color, not much on equipment.  Thus, the gear-luster may found this book is inferior to others.

However, I read it cover-to-cover and I found this book is not expensive for its price at all. As you can see from book details, six parts of this book are serious issues of Supply Chain Mamangement (SCM).  The first uniqueness of this book is the combination of all six major issues in a single \\"thick\\" book.  Part 1, basic concept, not only give you the basic idea and definition, but the foundation to understand other related issues of SCM.  Part 2, Supply contract, is another uniqueness, since not many books talk about.  The value information (part 3) is the bullwhip effect, which you can find in several journals. However, this book talks about the way to reduce the bullwhip effect as well as variation of information.  The forth part is the weakest of this book (in my opinion) since it doesn't pay more attention on multi-commodity impact on other areas (which I believe it's very important).  Part 5 is quite obsolate (the second weakness), but still great for reference or the first story if you are new to globalization of SCM.  The sixth part is the real-meat, particulary Chapter 27.  Chapter 27 compiles over 100 literatures in SCM.  Over 100 papers are categorized and shown concept/methodology.  I found it's very useful for literature reviews or SCM research.  Chapter 27 traces back to the first journal before the \\"name\\" of SCM was coined.  Chapter 23 is another meat of this book, written by Shapiro. The integration of strategics, tactical and operation are well descibed.  Shapiro extended the work in this book to his book.  This is one of the milestone book in this century.	2001-04-18

Unlike other books, Freeman spent more pages on equipment discussion as well as exposure. Therefore, I believe this book will favor both novice and professional photographers.  From the first page, Freeman starts with the fundmental of photography, a tool and basic exposure, then he extended the scope to &quot;visual design&quot;. Many simple workshops are given for your practice and I found they are very useful. The workshops are both &quot;visual design&quot; and &quot;exposure&quot; practice.

One chapter is dedicated for verification and validation of simulation models.  Although it's only one chapter, several references are given for further study. IE or logistic practioner will enjoy since one chapter is for manufacturing and material handling system (wow!). Very good reference and practice.	2001-03-25

I should believed Jim (another reviewer of this book). This book does not focus on ERP. Rather, it's a basic operation management book. There are only 2-3 chapters that really talk about ERP but only introduction. If you look for the introduction, &quot;Daniel E. O'Leary&quot; book is much more valuable (Enterprise Resource Planning Systems : Systems, Life Cycle, Electronic Commerce, and Risk). Although I am an IE, I don't think this book will be interesting other IE too. Like I said in subject, the author(s) try to pull everything, e.g., SCM, OM, and ERP and call it's an integration. The simulation game does not capture neither &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;application&quot;. I still don't understand why APICS publish this book in the market.	2001-03-23

Unlike other ERP book, O'Leary provides the fundamental, technical, and practical of ERP system. Many presented cases are well organized with the contents in the book. The long case is brought up on and off to remind reader about the process. If you like &quot;Why ERP?&quot; by Jacobs but want more technical and further reference, please grasp this book and study it. Many references are provided for further research as well.

While only few analytical SCM books in market, this book is still different. The presentation of math-modeling does not forbid your curiousity in model by giving a proof, theory, lemma; this book shows you the modeling method to capture the complex SCM problem. I like this book over Simchi-Levi (logic of logistics) for its description, practical aspect and future direction. Also, I prefer this book over Chopra (SCM) and Simchi-levi (SCM) for its higher and better modeling issues. This book takes care the readers well since the solution technique is also given, e.g., Linear Programming, Mixed Integer Programming, Unified Optimization, even simulation. While this book is more on quantitative, the interaction between qualitative and quantitative is given -both basic and advanced level. Suggestion to adapt modeling technique to organization is well presented also. The information technology (IT) section covers most SCM issues as well as the implementation and database for SCM.  If you're in this area (either academia or practitioner), you have NO EXCUSE not to get this book seriously. For its uniqueness, this book is not supplementary or option, but it's a requirement for you.	2001-02-22

The editor, Zenios, categorizes the conferences in great organization. Even though it was from conference, I almost have no feeling or conference paper reading at all. The book consists of 3 parts. Part I is the general idea of financial engineering with methodology (e.g. risk management, stochastic optimization).  Part II is the experience from practitioners (very good). Part III is more advanced issue in methodology. In sum, this is an intermediate book for senior undergrad or grad student or even practitioner in this area for the contents and presentation matter.	2001-02-20

Moreover, the guideline of recommend letter request is very good.  It's not only for people who ask letter of recommendation, but also for the recommendation letter writter can see what they should said to thier students. I disagree with other reviewer that this book is not limited only Law, Business, and Medical school.  It's true that the title said it and the examples are to Law, Business and Medical school. However, if you read it carefully, many examples and guidelines can be used in other school as well. This book is well written and organized.  However, due to limited resource, example and guideline, this book is only in 3 stars.	2001-02-18

This book is neighter. The intention of author a great innovative but the cases, application and examples are very limited. Additionally, the author always uses the application for explanation. The limited reference is only in educational areas, while I prefer to read a general idea or more in scientific research (see &quot;A Ph.D. Is Not Enough : A Guide to Survival in Science&quot; by Feibelman or &quot;Tomorrow's Professor : Preparing for Academic Careers in Science and Engineering&quot; by Reis). Therefore, this book is categorized as &quot;not-so-good-book&quot; for me. In contrast, my girlfriend in education school quite like this book. This book shows many reference to the referee journals including the statistics, e.g., acceptance rate, turn-over time, # article per year., etc. Therefore, this book is a &quot;good-book&quot; for education student, at least my friend.

I see The Race is not only a good companion of The Goal, but it can be used as &quot;Class material&quot; as well. The DBR illustration is clearly stated and I don't think I can see any illustration of The Goal production system better than this book.

The assumption of this book is &quot;this book aims to people who has no background in probability, normal random, and geometric Brownian motion&quot;.  Therefore, this book is suitable for managers, business students or CFO who want to get their first book in stochastic finance.  This book serves its purpose in that regard -compiling all basics and introductory issues in concise book. However, owning to the author's reputation and the title of the book, this book may distract your understanding before purchasing. Prof. Ross wrote several serious math book and many great stochastic books. So readers may expect more from this book.  I'm quite happy to see Ross wrote a simple book for every one as well as the hard-core mathematics books for someone.  Also, the title is somewhat distort the real meaning of this book. This book should have the title as &quot;Mathematical Finance for Managers&quot; or &quot;Mathematical Finance for Business&quot;, which are more suitable.  For both agree and disagree in some contents, I rate this book for 3 stars and which to see similar works to this book from Ross.	2001-02-16

I bought this book for 3 reasons; author's instution, title and publisher. After the book arrives, I know I have to change my criterion to buy the book. The book is nothing more than any traditional operation management book plus basic IT that you can see in magazine or cnet.com (cnet.com may be better). No depth, no width. Just a thin book with first year college textbook.  Not recommend.	2001-02-13

Some researchers want more mathematics might jump to  &quot;Logic of Logistics&quot; by Simchi-Levi directly.  To fill the gap of those 3 books (Handfield vs. Simchi-Levi (SCM) vs. Simchi-Levi (Logic of Logistics), Chopra and Meindl compile almost every issues in Supply Chain Management (SCM) that you can find in publications in this single book. This book is the best compromise between tactics and strategics.  Cases and analysis are presented with respect to the topic of each chapter. Only high school mathematics are more than enough to understand the analytical tools they proposed.  Readers may opt for this book either the first book in SCM or supplementary book for your further research/study. Chopra and Medindl book is a good support to your &quot;Design and Managing SCM&quot; by Simchi-Levi and I think it can be substituted if you need only one book.

I finally decide to give a comment of this book after had it for a couple of year.  Handfield and Nichols wrote this book *too* general and not emphasize in any research/application trend of Supply Chain  Management(SCM).  As a student, I found this book is the first -but not  only one- book for anyone who doesn't know about the SCM.  IF you do know  and need a &quot;concise book&quot; that you can finish in a night, get  this one.  Another disadvantage is no technical definition and  implementation issues.  Case studies are ok -but again, too general.	1999-09-21

It's not a bad book for beginers in Supply chain management (SCM).  This book introduces you to the basic fundamental with sufficient references. Not this book or any book in the world is comprehensive or plug-in  formulation.  So, don't expect to buy one-but-get-million.  Since this book  is only 200 pages, you can finish it in one night with sufficient knowledge  to do more research including some URLs for the web-surfers.	1999-06-14

The authors chose the wrong title, I guess. I agree with first review that this book is not worth time nor money. How could we optimize problem with &quot;verbal&quot;? We all need &quot;solutions&quot; -not  &quot;suggestion&quot;, even though suggestion is transformed from  solution. Still, quantitative analysis comes before explaination for  optimization. Look for another book unless you want to spend somes bucks to  get the book.	1999-06-06

It's a nice book for undergrad class in business school or introductory class of management in engineering fields.  Again, this is not the book that can be used as a  textbook at all.  Too simple and spend half book just for &quot;roughly  talking&quot;.  Reader can found more reviews in &quot;Interfaces, Vol.29,  (2), 1999&quot;, in Book review section.  The economic of technology is the  more important is ignored in this book.  Not recommend.	1999-05-31

I personally like Tompkins's writting style in all of his book.  Good Chase is another story that capture the logistic problem in layman language, easier to understand.  Like The Goal, this book tells the  technique and idea through the story.  Unlike The Goal, this book has more  technical and focus on logistic/distribution system.	1999-05-25

Even though the book is intended for graduate student, it's not too hard for undergrad at all.  You can do more details -after reading Factory Physics- by using  this book.  I would give it more than 5 stars if Amazon have!	1999-04-30

Don't forget to get this book.  Silver et.al. review + explore the inventory problem in both macro and micro viewpoint.  For  supply chain manager, this book is more quantitative (infact, I think this  is the most quantitative analysis) and full of reference (more than 150-200  references for each chapter).  One disadvantage though... Too expensive...  don't you consider to have the paperback edition?  C'mon... student doesn't  have much money.	1999-04-22

Glover and Laguna conduct this book in a self-comprehensive book.  I've never found any good resource of Tabu Search as great as this  book.  Only drawback is the price... too expensive for student.  I only  read it in the library though. I'm glad to know they have the paperback  edition but I'm not sure about the quality of printing. Lastly, get it  whenver you can afford it!.  It's worth your money every characters.	1999-04-20

To me, this is an extreamly great book of Advanced Linear Programming and I love it!.  If you're looking for a great pointer for  Integer programming or Combinatorial Optimization, this is the one.

The textbook is well organized and completed in itself. The reason of 4 stars instead of 5 is too much &quot;ROW LAYOUT&quot;, which I think it's the only special case and rarely  found in real-world application.  Otherwise, this is one of the great books  for student and professional.	1999-03-29

As the title said, using Siman. To me, it's ok for &quot;using SIMAN&quot;, but not enough for simulation concept. If you want to use SIMAN, buy this book. If  you want to know simulation in details, get &quot;Simulation Modeling and  Analysis&quot;(ISBN 0070366985). SIMAN becomes Arena interface now.  If you  &quot;just&quot; want to use Simulation for your problem using Siman with  Arena interface, grasp this book &quot;0075612593&quot;.  Kelton wrote it  with lots of tutorial!	1999-03-29

This book is self-explaination.  Tutorial is great.  Easy to walk-through or jump to  each chapter if you want to. If you are &quot;or&quot; will be using Arena,  get this book.  You won't regret it.  Don't forget to check another book of  Kelton.  That book will take you to more detail of what simulation is.	1999-03-29
