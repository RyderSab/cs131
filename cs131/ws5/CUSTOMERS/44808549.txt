It was valuable because it gave an entertaining and informational perspective on rural China in the late 1990s by an outsider. The author's knowledge of the Chinese language allowed him to vividly portray the conversations and his daily life as a teacher in a Fuling high school. He included snippets of essays and thoughts that his students had written for his class on various topics, giving the reader an insider's look at the opinions and feelings of the growing educated Chinese middle class. Had the author of spent two years in Shanghai or Beijing or Xi'an his experience would have likely been much different. It is because of his willingness to spend two years in central China among the hard- working people there that makes this book different. It is a great memoir, travelogue and personal reflection that anyone interested in China should read.	2005-09-10

Recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew I wanted to go into M&A work, I decided to read it. I thought the book was excellent, but maybe unnecessarily long. The authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation. The two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not, but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless. For someone interested in pursuing a top Wall Street job, this book is a must. For everyone else that just likes good non-fiction, this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era.	2005-08-26

Although not a long book, so much happens within the book, leaving the reader caught up between the narrator's past in Afghanistan and his current life in East Bay, California. This book is about the love between a father and a son, the love between loyal friends, forgiveness, regret and remorse, war, and even immigrants' transitions into America. After all of the hype I had to pick up this book and see for myself. I was pleasantly surprised. This is the best novel I have read in a long time and one I will not soon forget. The author's ability to vividly portray images, conversations and characters is immpressive and I look forward to his next book.	2005-08-16

With that said, however, this book finishes strong and was an interesting read overall. This book is not the Da Vinci Code and many of Dan Brown's readers may be disappointed with it. The plot is slower and takes place all at Princeton University. The mystery the main characters are trying to solve is harder to grasp then in other similar books and there are fewer tidbits of fascinating knowledge regarding the ancient world. When the mystery is solved, though, and the reader finally knows what occurred in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili and why it was written during the Renaissance, the story becomes more interesting. I'm afraid that by then its' too late and the readers finish the book merely because they have come so far into it. Perhaps the most valuable part of the book is the authors' keen observations regarding friendship, relationships, and human nature. The book was good, but not great.	2005-07-26

Ellis's portrayal of one of the greatest Americans of the infant nation is brilliant. Ellis is able to tap into the mind of Washington and depict to the reader what Washington was and may have been thinking at different stages in his life, from a General to the President, to the Mount Vernon farmer that Washington longed to be. Ellis is able to do all of this beautifully and sufficiently in less than three hundred pages. For those merely wanting to read a good biography on interesting and crucial events in America's history, this is an excellent book. For those readers interested in a more in-depth look at Washington and his life, this is an excellent place to start. Ellis never disappoints.	2005-07-15

He has written a book relevant to all. \\"The World is Flat\\" is a brilliant book for anyone, from parents to politicians from Tokyo to Tulsa. Anyone who has spent time at any university in the U.S. (not just the top schools) can testify that the future of medicine, engineering, technology and labratory science  rests largely on the shoulders of the Chinese and Indians. Their increasing numbers in the most prestigious programs in the country are impressive, and most Americans are doing nothing about it.<br /><br />I agree with Friedman that there really is an ambition gap between many young people in the U.S. and many of the young people outside of the U.S. All great societies and civilizations have fallen and there is no reason to believe the U.S.A. will continue its dominance in the coming years. Signs of other countries surpassing the U.S. in science, technology, and sports are all around us. Friedman easily explains why this is happening, what we can and should do about it, and poses issues that need resolving since the world went flat, most of which were non-existent only a few years ago. Friedman is giving his own country a wake-up call.<br /><br />I am glad that Friedman spent a chapter focused on how many people in the world still live in poverty and how little technology exists in some places in the world. Parts of the book may have the reader believe that the whole world is constantly on their BlackBerrys. But he acknowledges that this is not the case. Unfortunately, despite the millions of lives technology has affected in the past decade, millions more fight daily for the basic necessities of life. If the world could collectively put forth as much effort and money into fighting hunger and ignorance as it does creating the latest technology, the world would become a much better and safer place.	2005-06-18

Borneman gave me what I wanted. I was able to better understand the antecedents of the War, beginning at the turn of the nineteenth century. A few things I liked about the book were that I felt Borneman was thorough without going on for too long and the book was not boring.  With that said, however, I did not think Borneman was as delightful to read as some other historians writing for a popular audience, such as McCullough or Chernow. But I give Borneman credit for taking on the War of 1812. The book was well-researched and informative - just what I was looking for.	2005-06-08

The premise is what made me initially interested: a group of 13 strangers are stranded in the airport in Tokyo for the night and decide to pass the time by telling stories. Sounds interesting, right? I thought that the stories would be global and realistic stories about people and life. I was wrong. The stories are certainly global, and the author describes beautifully each city in the book with intimate knowledge, but the collection of stories are more like fairy tales and fantasies. I did not fully understand many of the stories, but the book kept me reading nonetheless. Overall, it was not a bad book, just different. The author writes well, and for the imaginative, this may be a great book. I just think that I would have liked similar stories about life told without the fantasy better.	2005-05-18

With that said, however, this book isn't that bad, especially if you are looking for a quick read that will keep your attention. I don't think \\"Hour Game\\" was one of Baldacci's best books, but it did capture me in the beginning and kept me reading to the end. There are a lot of characters in the book and the story does somehow entagle all of them in this small Virginian town murder mystery, but Baldacci does a good job at keeping the story flowing and does not confuse the reader too much. In any event, this book served its purpose - I didn't learn anything but it entertained me as I travelled this past week.	2005-03-31

The book was a good and informative read, though it was a bit dry in a few parts. But if you can get through the few dry parts, Bix does a good job at portraying Japan's position during WWII, the influential people surrounding the Emperor, and Hirohito's refusal to accept defeat until August 1945. What is especially great about this book is its telling of the stories that few people know, specifically the events of U.S. occupation to 1952 and the struggles of Japan in the post-1952 era to the end of the Showa period. Overall this was a good biography of Hirohito, unquestionably one of the most loved and hated men of the last century.	2005-03-15

Cherny's thesis is that we need to give the government back to people. He notes that the big government that dominated so much of the nineteenth century was necessary to effectively create change in Americans' lives at that time. But today, the government has not responded to the needs of the \\"Choice Generation\\" - the younger generation today that has a broad range of choices, from ipod colors to salad dressings. Consequently, the government is less effective than it could be. To remedy the situation, he proposes some ideas ,some radical and some pratical, that, if implemented, would improve the situation of my generation and give the government more credibility. Personally, I think some of the ideas were great and would significantly alter the face of this country (the idea of requiring one year of public service for all young people when they turn 18, for example, is a great idea). Agree with them or not, the ideas included in this book are worth a read, and though it may be awhile, I think many of them will eventually come to pass.	2005-01-24

But that is not why this book has done so well. This book has become a bestseller becuase it's the story of a young, intelligent boy who is stranded on a small lifeboat with a tiger, among other animals. As other reviewers have warned, this book is not for the weak stomached. Some scenes in the book are so disgusting they are difficult to read. Yet, the story is so compelling, I couldn't take my eyes from the page. I shivered and bore it, and I'm glad I did. This is a great book that can be read in a short time. The end of the book also throws in a twist that leaves the reader deep in thought.	2004-11-08

I agree with some of the other reviewers that Chernow sought to make Hamilton appear as the most intelligent, important, and delightful of the founding fathers by the way in which he speaks of Madison, Jefferson, Adams, and even Washington. But then again, Hamilton just may have been. It is, however, without a doubt that Hamilton is the most important founding father that never reached the office of the president. Hamilton played a crucial role in shaping the United States as we know it now, from his part in the Constitutional Convention and his writing of the Federalist Papers, to the establishment of both a federal bank and the Bank of New York. It's a shame that Hamilton allowed politics and pride to interfere with his life to the extent that he did. The result was an early death at the hand of what appears to be from the book an uncaring and slimy politician, Aaron Burr. Hamilton was one of the most brilliant minds of the early nation and an extended life could have resulted in many more nation-changing ideas and institutions. This book kept me reading to the end, all 731 pages. I promise, if you have patience to complete this book, you will be rewarded with a wealth of historical and practical knowledge.	2004-09-10

Who would think that a building completed in 1931 at 1250 feet high would still be the tallest building in NYC in 2007 (of course, we can't forget the tragic loss of the taller WTC Towers). This book covers the quick construction of the ESB, but also covers the politics and history behind the building's location (the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel used to be at the corner of 5th Ave and 34th Street) and the people involved. This is an interesting book about an exciting time where anything seemed possible in one of the world's greatest cities.	2004-08-11

After reading the book my first thoughts were that if I was to die and sent to a place like this, it would not be so bad. The main character in the book, Eddie, is an old amusement park maintenance worker who dies while trying to save a little girl after one of the newer rides malfunctions. Eddie dies during the heroic act and is then sent to five seperate locations to meet five people. Each person teaches Eddie a lesson and shows him finally how he and their life was somehow intertwined. Everyone's story is one and the same, according to Albom, but we sometimes must die first to understand in what way we touched other individuals' lives. The essential message in this book is that everyone matters. Our life is touched and changed by others just as we touch and leave an imprint on others in this process of life. The book is short, well-written, and thought provoking. In short, it is a delightful little book and better than the author's previous best seller, &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie.&quot;	2004-08-02

I must agree with some of the other reviewers and state that parts of this book are a bit hard to believe, but so are many other fictional books. In this book Baldacci comes up with an original and suspenseful plot: The national lottery is rigged by an almost superhuman man, the villain in this book, and a poor, single mother in rural Georgia is given a chance to start a new life as a multi-millionaire if she promises to leave the country for good. The plot thickens when the heroine comes back to the United States. Another former lawyer turned writer, Baldacci shows in this book that he has the brains and the ability to write novels that rival the best fictional authors of our day. Overall, this is an entertaining and good quick read - what most people should be looking for in a novel.	2004-07-22

Both of these Dan Brown thrillers include the sometimes superhuman actions and instincts of a Harvard symbologist, an ancient secret brotherhood,a smart, sexy woman, and a twist at the end of the plot that will leave you wanting more. This book reads quickly and is full of interesting facts about Rome, the Vatican City and Papal succession in the Roman Catholic Church. I had to smile at some the similarities this book had with The Da Vinci Code (Angels and Demons came first), but I kept turning those pages nonetheless. I was hooked all the way to the end. All I was looking for from this book was something interesting to read during my daily commute, and I got that and so much more from this book. And for that reason, combined with Brown's engaging stories, this book deserves five stars.	2004-07-12

The author's descriptions of the locations she visited over the past fifty years as a journalist  are insightful and, in my mind, fairly accurate. She is more than a travel writer. Morris is an artist, taking what she sees in the places and people of foreign places and turning them into vivid expressions on the page for the reader to both visualize and experience. Morris also does a great job at not only explaining the places she writes about as she sees them, but also at explaining the history behind where she is and the significance of it all. This book not only is a journey across the vast world we live in but is a great way to study the history of the post-modern twentieth century world. The only confusing part, however, is the sex change she underwent in Morocco in the 1970s. I wish I would have known that going into the book because the photo of the author on the back flap undeniably shows a woman, but for the first half of the book the author was constantly referred to as a man. The whole thing had me confused, but became more understandable after Morris' trip to Casablanca where he/she came out of a surgeon's basement literally a new . . . uh, person. (an interesting chapter in the book). Despite the interesting surgery, though, this is a well-written book worth reading.	2004-07-02

Richie travels from island to island within the Inland Sea of Japan. His insights and comments on the country are intriguing and entertaining. The reader is able to view this truly remarkable region of Japan through the eyes of a foreigner. Richie's language ability in Japanese allows him to become one with the Japanese in conversation (or at least as much as is possible for a foreigner in Japan to become one with the people), and his English writing ability keeps the reader full of emotions - from laughing to feeling lonely, to (perhaps for some) lusting after Japanese schoolgirls. This book really is beautifully written, once the reader gets used to Richie's sometimes abrupt style. This book is different from other travelougues about Japan because the author is not afraid to be honest with his feelings towards the country (though Alan Booth's works are worth reading). Anyone interested in the Japan of today or yesterday should read this book, because life in the Inland Sea is and was definitely distinct (if not better in many ways) from life in Tokyo or Osaka, today or yesterday.	2004-05-03

After living in Japan for a few years (not on the JET Programme) I recognized a lot of truth to what Feiler had to say. This book also provided me with an inside look at and the pros and cons of the Japanese school system. Through my own experience, I honestly am amazed at the amount of pressure placed on students to do well in school in Japan. For the most part, the students' effort pays off when they are accepted into a great high school or college, regardless of the two-hour-one-way commute some of them endure. At the same time, however, I wish the school system in Japan encouraged students to be more creative and that the environment allowed them to learn more about the world around them. Despite that, though, the Japanese people make great students and are some of the nicest people you'll meet in your life. This book, through the author's experiences in Tochigi Prefecture, show this and more, all in an entertaining, well-written way. And if for that reason alone, this book is worth reading once for anyone interested in Japan.	2004-04-13

Dan Brown also uses his talented writing ability to keep the pace of the story moving rapidly. Politics, science, suspense, action, and even a touch of love are crammed into this book. Consequently, I couldn't put this book down. The short chapters combined with the interesting story and realistic characters make this book a great short read for anyone. And the most fascinating part of this book is that it is not inconceivable that the events Brown created could happen. Regardless of your interests and expertise, there is something in this book for you, especially if you like fiction.	2004-03-26

And boy was I surprised. Although the characters are fictional, the historical events and people are real. This book allowed me to see Christianity in a different light. But I am skeptical as to how much of it is true. Many of the reviewers of this book complain that the book is full of inaccuracies and mistakes, but I thought it was a great read. It's fiction, albeit historical fiction, but what did some of the readers expect when they opened a work of fiction? Fact? I hope not. All I know is that I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. I found it interesting, informative, and suspensful. That is probably what Dan Brown intended the book to be and that is what I got from it. And for that, it was worth my time and money.	2004-03-09

This book is worth the read, however. Readers can learn a lot from this book - especially what not to do in negotiations and the importance of using the threat of filing a suit as bargaining power to settle early. The plaintiffs lawyer, Jan Schlitchman, was a hard-working lawyer that became caught up in greed and forgot many times to ask what the plaintiffs (all of whom lost children to a disease linked to contaminated groundwater in a town north of Boston) what they really were seeking from the suit and from the defendants. I agree with many of the other reveiwers that this book reads like fiction. It's almost too bad it isn't.	2004-02-19

The main character, John Rain, is a former CIA officer of half-Japanese descent that finds himself lost between two cultures - the United States and Japan. Still haunted by his experiences in Vietnam, Rain manages to finally get revenge and put some of his nightmares to rest while falling for a beautiful Japanese jazz pianist, who happens to be the daughter of the politician Rain kills in the opening chapters. Overall, this is not a bad book. It's not a great book either. But if you are looking for a quick read, this book is well written enough that it will keep you interested.

For someone just beginning to explore the beauty and depth of the Japanese people and culture, however, I recommend that they begin with a different book and work their way up to Kerr. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that Kerr does come off as an elitist, but that isn't necessarily a negative thing. Anyone who has studied at Yale and Oxford, and has lived in Japan for as long as Kerr has, I think, has some authority to write as if they know what they are talking about, especially if they do it tastefully like Kerr does.<br />I liked some chapters better than others in this book, but overall, I thought it was well done and included useful insights into Japan and its culture that only a gaijin (foreigner or &quot;outside person&quot;) would understand. As much as I love Japan, I am not as interested in Japanese traditional art and theatre as Kerr is, but reading his short compiled articles (this book is a compilation of articles originally published in Japanese) did help me appreciate and better understand the mysteries of Japan. Moreover, this is a fairly short book and is not difficult to get through. This is a good book for anyone remotely interested in a country that is very traditional and ancient, but yet one of the most modern countries in appearance and thought in the world - Japan.	2003-10-07

But I have to admit that this book was my favorite of them all. Not only was the author witty in his commentary of Japan, he was surprisingly insightful as well in his observations of the Japanese. I have travelled through much of Japan and can attest that Mr. Ferguson is pretty on point with his opinions and remarks of the country and the people. I found my self laughing out loud in some chapters and stopping to re-read others. (One great thing about this book is that the chapters are so small even a few brief minutes will allow you to further your journey through Japan).<br />The author is also a very talented writer. Many of his analogies and descriptions were imaginative and well-written. Even those who have never been to Japan can, I think, benefit from this book by beginning to understand (or at least as much as a Gaijin can) the peculiar and fascinating intricacies of the Japanese people. I love the people of Japan and have spent the past five years among them. But just when I think I have them figured out, I'm wrong. My ideas fall from the limbs of my mind like sakura. This book gave me new ideas and concepts to think about, and I thank the author for that. Overall, this is an excellent book for anyone interested in Japan. And a good book for anyone who's not.	2003-09-26

The downside of this, however, is that the book sometimes feels more like a novel than a historical interpretation of one of the most important but least recognized events in U.S. history - the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. But overall, this is an excellent book.<br />When the Fair was awarded to the underdog - Chicago - many people, including its creators, often doubted if they could pull the Fair off with the limited time they were alloted and with the granduer needed to show up the amazing Fair Paris had recently held in 1889. Larson covers the Fair from its conception to its magnificence to its destruction, and does so brilliantly.<br />The second story included in Larson's book is the history of a serial killer. Larson, I thought, does a good job at the incredibly difficult task at getting into the mind of the killer. I found some of the discoveries a bit disturbing, but in a fascinating way. This book definately kept my attention and I recommend it to anyone interested in recent U.S. history.	2003-09-21

A collection of articles and essays published by McCullough in the past few decades, this book is truly the epitome of well written and researched history. McCullough definately knows how to make his subjects (dead people and events that very few people know about) come back to life. His prose flows like a fictional narrative. The people and events discussed are enough to make you wonder often if the book is fiction. But it's not. All of McCullough's sources are authentic. And what he doesn't know, he'll admit - a sign of a true historian.<br />If you like history you'll love this book. As an amateur historian myself I greatly appreciated the last few chapters in the book where McCullough emphasized the importance of learning our history, as well as the need for us to write our own. This is a short, but highly entertaining and beneficial book. Highly recommended.	2003-08-20

I backpacked through four countries in Western Europe this summer and I followed much of the advice contained within this book in my preparation and travels. I encountered no problems in my travels, but it still felt good to be better prepared than not. As far as the back door adventures . . . well I didn't get to any of them. I stayed in the large cities and the &quot;touristy&quot; spots of Europe, but the information and advice within this book is beneficial to anyone, regardless of where they're going. The only thing I didn't do that Steves recommended is to leave the book in the hostel for the next traveler. I'm going to keep this book and use it the next time I prepare to fly off to Europe for awhile.	2003-07-28

I start Law School this fall and I will follow the advice in this book. I have read a lot of &quot;How To . . .&quot; law school books and memoirs and this book is one of the best by far. What makes this book so helpful is that it is written by a group of recent law school graduates from around the country who share their advice on how to stay ahead of the game in law school. Plus, this book takes the reader step by step through three years of school and two summers of working experience. It is interesting to read, well written, and full of great advice. Do not start law school without reading this book.	2003-07-28

It always amazed me how the main character, Sidney, a new mom and powerhouse lawyer, constantly escaped the hands of her predators, who, by the way, easily managed to kill everyone else Sidney contacted. But that's fiction for you.<br />Overall I thought this was a good book though. It's the type of book that will keep you turning pages, even when you don't want to anymore. The ending was a little weak, but the story is complex and well written. I know that I'm not giving this book rave reviews, but I do respect authors like Baldacci for their ability to produce a book like this. I say that becuase it's something I don't think I could do.	2003-06-17

But, this is easily one of the best biographies I have ever read. McCullough takes the reader through a critical time period in United States history and beautifully portrays the events of much of the twentieth century. And he is able to do it largely through the words of Harry Truman himself. McCullough's impressive narrative style, analytical ability, and superb research also helps to make this book an excellent read. This book, however, is long (1000 pages). But it hardly felt that way. I was entertained the whole way through and always looked forward to free time to read some more. The characters, events, and places were all real, and I had to sometimes remind myself that this is a work of non-fiction. When I picked up the book I felt as if I was transported to another time and place before my generation, a time and place that I learned to respect more thanks to this book. I was pulled into this book, that's how powerful this book is, and I now feel like a close friend of Harry Truman. I experienced the dialogue, significance, and weight of the decisions made by the Truman administration in his almost eight years in office. My admiration for President Truman, his humbleness, and his desire to do what is right grew tremendously throughout this book. This is research and historical storytelling at its best.	2003-06-14

His narrative style turns almost unknown historical events into &quot;epic stories.&quot; And &quot;The Great Bridge&quot; is no exception. I came to know McCullough after &quot;John Adams&quot; was published, but have since decided to take the time to read all of his works. He never ceases to amaze me. &quot;The Great Bridge&quot; is a well-written, interesting, detailed history of the Broklyn Bridge, the Eight Wonder of the Modern World.<br />The characters come to life in this story, and the reader is transported into late nineteenth century New York City as an insider to watch the bridge rise from the caissons below the East River to the two gothic arches that dominated the skyline at their completion. From there, the reader can vividly visualize the wire and roadway stretch across the river until the bridge's completion. The book then ends with a spectacular grand opening of the Brooklyn Bridge. McCullough also focuses on the politics and people behind the bridge, and finishes his masterpiece by quoting an elderly woman from Long Island that remembers that the excitement in 1969, when two men walked on the moon, was nothing compared to the day the Brooklyn Bridge opened.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates good history. This book is not just for lovers of New York City and civil engineers. &quot;The Great Bridge&quot; is another McCullough masterpiece.	2003-06-02

Stephanopoulos pulled me in from the beginning and took me on a ride through the hectic year of Bill Clinton's first campaign for the Presidency. The first few years Stephanopoulos worked in the White House as an advisor to President Clinton also captivated me. And then the book got boring. It wasn't that the events of the first four years of Clinton's term were boring, but the second half of the book just failed to hold my attention as strong as the first half did. Maybe the book was longer than necessary? I don't know, but the one thing I kept asking myself while reading this book is this: What did the Clintons (and other people the book named who had worked closely with the President) think when this book was published a few years ago? Don't get me wrong, the author had a lot of nice things to say. But at times he also had some not so nice things to say. But that, I guess, comes with the job. Anyone willing to work for a public official (especially one as powerful as the president of the United States) must be ready to accept public criticism and embarassment.<br />Overall, though, I liked this book. Stephanopoulos said something at the beginning of the book that I thought summed up the experience of working with a U.S. president. He said that while on the road campaigning or traveling everything he must know was either &quot;in his mind, in his pocket (on paper, of course), or not more than a phone call away.&quot; That, I thought, is why successful people are successful. It's not always their brilliance. Sometimes success comes simply through connections.	2003-05-17

The author describes how small events connect people from different places and times in the world. It's quite an original idea, and Mitchell pulled it off excellently. Each chapter is like a totally different story but is somehow connected to the events of the previous chapter, even if the connection is so minor that the reader almost misses it.

But putting his personality and interviewing style aside, I find myself agreeing with him most of the time. And that was why I liked this book.<br />This book is simply a transcript of interviews conducted by Mr. O'Reilly with some of the most prominent people in the country. O'Reilly also provides useful background information and commentary to every chapter, albeit the book is a few years old now.<br />This book is short, easy to understand, and chock full with O'Reilly's personality. I found the book beneficial and I know you can too, whether you agree with the man or not.

Baldacci's characters are more real than some of the characters out of Grisham's books, for example, but I thought it was easy to become confused with the number of people introduced at the beginning of this book. Like all of his books though, the first few chapters pull the reader in just enough to make them finish the book.

Although New York City is the most exciting city in the world, its history, if not written well, could be boring to many people. But Lankevich succeeded. This book is not boring, but rather held my interest until the end. Of course, many events are not addressed in the book or are barely touched upon because of its length, but Lankevich provides a good history for those that are not ready to tackle &quot;Gotham,&quot; or some of the other massive histories of NYC that are out there.<br />The one comment I have, though, is that I thought Lankevich spent too much time discussing the &quot;high history&quot; of NYC mayors and politics.

His publishers may even be pushing him to finish a book a year. The result, however, are books written very rapidly, or at least they appear to be. This is not my favorite Grisham book by far. But it is not a bad book either. And regardless of how fast his books continue to come out, I will still read them. Why? Because I have read enough great Grisham books in the past that I have the hope that his next book will be his best. In other words, I still believe that Grisham's shallow, rapidly-constructed stories of the past several years can return to be the great legal thrillers of a decade ago. And it is this that keeps me reading his books.	2003-04-11

Although it's a work of fiction, the book does not read like it. Easily understandable and interesting, this book should be read by everyone contemplating law school.

This book will not disappoint you, especially if you like traveling and are fascinated with Japan.

The way he makes the characteres he meets along the way of his journey come to life is outstanding. I really enjoy this book and wish that he had written others before he died.

US	44808549	RGN91WTQQ2WP9	0060938455	515614189	Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Fast Food Will Never Be The Same	Schlosser's book is more than just the story of how the third most populous nation in the world has become dependent on greasy, quick food, but rather deals with a variety of issues ranging from the history of the fast food industry in the United States to the horrors of the meatpacking industry in the U.S., to the teenage employees who handle the millions of orders across the country everyday.<br />Schlosser begins by recounting to the reader the success stories of the fast food industry's founding fathers and how a bunch of hot dog carts amidst the drive-in post World War II culture in southern California grew to be internationally recognized and dominant powers. He relates the story of the McDonald's brothers and their Speedee Service Famous Hamburger restaurant in San Bernardino and a brilliant salesman from Illinois named Ray Kroc, the mastermind behind what we now know as McDonald's. The beginnings of Carl's Jr., and Kentucky Fried Chicken (which, by the way, opened its first store in Salt Lake City in 1952) are also told by Schlosser.<br />Schlosser also notes that the fast food industry in the U.S. is the largest multinational industry in the world that depends largely on young, unskilled, immigrant, and sometimes illiterate workers to handle the work load. Managers of restaurants are usually in their twenties and the lack of specific training to operate any of the equipment in a fast food restaurant allows the industry to continue to replace employees at an alarming rate. The author notes that the average fast food employee is only employed between three to four months before he or she quits or leaves their job. The desperation for temporary employment for many of the fast food chain's workers causes them to settle for minimum wage and allows the industry to pocket a much higher profit because the vast majority of employees do not stay long enough to receive the benefits offered by most chains.<br />Schlosser then takes the reader into the secret world where the fast food flavors and smells are manufactured, Yup, I said it, manufactured. The familiar smells of fresh fries and hamburger patties from behind the counter at our local McDonald's are largely the outcome of years of research and hard work by food scientists in large factories just off the New Jersey Turnpike, the same factories that manufacture six of the ten best-selling perfumes in the country. These artificial flavors are completely safe, remarks Schlosser, and appear in some form in most of the foods Americans eat today.<br />The book then journeys from the flavor factories of New Jersey to the slaughterhouses and meat packing plants of the Midwest. As a warning, the several chapters dealing with meat are not recommended for those with a weak stomach. Schlosser reveals some of the terrors of the meat packing industry. He tells of everything, from how the E-Coli breakouts across the country in the past decade started, to the stories of the occasional illegal immigrant who accidentally loses a body part in the meat-grinding machine. The author claims the worst and some of the most dangerous jobs in the country are those found inside of a slaughterhouse and recounts many gruesome personal stories from interviews he conducted over the course of his research. However, almost a century later, much of Fast Food Nation still reads like Upton Sinclair's famous 1906 work, The Jungle, the book that exposed the disgusting conditions of the Chicago slaughterhouses at the turn of the century and forced President Theodore Roosevelt and Congress to enact food safety legislation. The meat packing industry has since developed one of the strongest lobbying groups in Washington and uses their power to manipulate what will bring them the most profit, many times with little regard to their workers or safety conditions.<br />The final chapter deals with the global repercussions of the American fast food industry and the backlash the industry has received recently from around the world. McDonald's and other American fast food restaurants have been blamed by many for trying to homogenize the entire world with hamburgers, fries, and a smile. I however, have traveled briefly overseas at various occasions and can testify that McDonald's fries do taste the same throughout the world, and that the golden arches are often times a welcome sight to the overseas American.<br />In the end, Schlosser proposes a plan to his readers telling what and how to clean up the fast food industry. He also encourages readers to choose wisely.&iexcl;§Nobody in the United States is forced to buy fast food,\\" he remarks. The billion dollar grossing fast food companies are here to give us what we, the consumers, want, and until we demand something different or better, we will continue to get it their way.nd the world.

This is not that long of a book and is full of interesting facts and stories. Thank you Joseph Ellis for your research.	2003-02-27

Crier tells the American people how we have hijacked our legal system in this great book. She has no other motives or hidden agenda other than the desire to re-establish our country along the lines of justice, equality, and opportunity. But what I thought was great about this book is that she not only presented problems (anyone can do that, but I must admit that Crier's research and analysis is outstanding), she also offered solutions and suggestions on how to \\"take back\\" our legal system. This is an interesting book and a must read for anyone interested in current affairs or law.	2003-02-26

But I really enjoyed this book. I too have walked through much of Japan and can confirm many of the struggles and experiences that being a gaijin in Japan brings. But I cannot say I will be walking through Japan anytime soon. Alan Booth already did that for me and allowed me to really live through the journey through his beautifully- written book. This is a charming book that I think portrays an accurate picture of Japan and its people. But, what did his wife think about all of this?	2003-02-25

I agree with Dershowitz, about the 2000 election but also think that his argument could have been much shorter. Overall, however, it was a quick and informative read written easily for all of us that are not accustomed to legalise. Skim this book and get the main ideas, but don't spend too long - there are too many other good books out there.	2003-02-25

That's why I read him. This book, although not excellent, is good (I like &quot;The Lady and the Monk&quot; better though). I really enjoyed the last chapter of the book about his experiences as a foreigner in Japan. I could relate because I too, lived as a foreigner in Japan. But the remainder of the book came across to me as a little bit too much. In other words - exaggerated and overdone. But this is not a worthless book. It's merit comes in remembering that these are the author's ideas and experiences - not everyone else's.	2003-02-22

I think the stories, information, and ideas in this book are relevant to the life that most of us live today. And if you disagree, at least read the book for its witty humor and entertaining stories. Highly recommended for people who enjoy current affairs and good non-fiction.	2003-02-22

I would like to go to law school, but reconsidered after I read this book. However, it also excited me for the challenge of law school at the same time. If Scott Turow can make it through, why can't I? Right?<br />I cannot yet say how accurate the book is, but I did enjoy it. I don't think much of Turow's advice will come in handy when I'm a One L, but I do think that it should be read by all those considering going to law school. Overall, this is a great read that kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I'll revise my review in a year after completing my first year of law school and report on how my &quot;turbulent first year&quot; was.	2003-02-22

I must admit that I was given this book as a gift and was intimitaded by it at first because of its length and topic. I like biographies, but did not know much, nor did I have much interest in J.D. Rockefeller. But upon completion of the book, I am very impressed. The time and energy spent to compose a book of this magnitude must be enormous. This is an interesting book that will take you into the life of a fascinating person and on a ride through America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.	2003-02-22

Although I don't like fishing (Duncan's favorite subject), I do like good stories. And Duncan knows how to write them. This book is easy to read because it is a compilation of short stories, albeit some better than others. But all the stories are worth reading at least once. And believe me, after the first time, you will be returning to read a few of the stories over and over. I know I did.	2003-02-22

Iyer portrays in his book the difficulty in communication between Japanese women and the foreigners they fall for. The mysticism of O-Bon, the Japanese festival of the dead. And the frustrating and even heartbreaking relationships of too many Japanese couples - all while he himself is slowly falling for a married Japanese women that he cannot effectively communicate with. But he does a good job at it. I lived in Japan as a foreigner for a few years (made me appreciate the book more) and can say that Iyer is pretty accurate in his analysis of the country. Nonetheless, it's a good read for anyone.	2003-02-22

Although the locations and ideas are real, the story itself is not. &quot;Brazil-Maru&quot; is an interesting book with living characters and is a good &quot;fictional&quot; account of the lives of Japanese immigrants to Brazil in this past century.	2003-02-16

As one interested in the law, I really enjoyed this book. But I also found it hard to empathize with the author. I agree that a lot of discrimination within the workplace still exists in the United States, but much of this book came across to me as &quot;whining&quot; why the other guy (who happens to be white) makes 115,000 a year, while he (the black author) &quot;only&quot; makes 95,000 a year. Discrimination? Perhaps, but he is still better off (regardless of if he'll ever make partner at some firm or not) than the vast majority of Americans, or people across the world for that matter. &quot;The Good Black&quot; is just another chapter in America's continuing struggle with race.	2003-02-16

I do think, however, that the book contains too many full interviews of Japanese-Brazilians that basically state the same thing: That they, the Japanese-Brazilians, are Brazilian and not Japanese. (Japanese is only their ethnicity, not their nationality or cultural affiliation).<br /> However, I did enjoy the book because of its original ideas and found it to be helpful in my understanding and current research of the dekasegi phenomenon in Japan.	2003-02-16

Overall, it is a well written piece of work that I found helpful in my reseach. Although it is not the most comprehensive book on Japan's new ethnic minoritiy population,the Brazilians, Roth's work is worthwhile nonetheless.	2003-02-16

And a Japanese translator that speaks any language the author can think of all tied together by an ending that will leave you confused and disappointed What kind of story is this? I will admit, however, that Patchett writes well, but I do not think that the story itself is worthy of the awards it has received.	2003-02-14

McCullough displays amazing research capabilities in &quot;John Adams,&quot; but yet the reader never becomes bored and loses interest. The biography almost reads like a novel and I had to stop a few times to remember that I was reading a non-fiction book. Truly a fascinating account about the life of one of ths most important figures in American history. John Adams has become one of my new heroes.	2003-02-13

The author's beautiful prose took me back to a time and place of hanging lanterns, reverent temples, and of course, geisha. This book does a good job of showing that geisha are not prostitutes, like so many people think, but are rather dignified entertainers. I also think the author depicts the attitude of so many Japanese men - an attitude that, until recently, women have put up with. I really enjoyed this book. It's brilliantly written, full of interesting and lifelike characters, and meangingful. Zehi, yonde mite kudasai.	2003-02-07

The characters in \\"The Chamber\\" are better developed than some of his other books, notably some of his more recent books. As the reader, a bond formed between the main characters and I throughout the book. It was this closeness with the characters combined with a well-written story and thoughtful dialogue that provided me with the opportunity to contemplate something I had never really thought about before - the death penalty. I really enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone who has read and enjoyed any of Grisham's other books.	2003-01-08

The answer is in the entertaining, imformative, and at times hilarious book from the master con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. I reccomend Abagnale's book for anyone who likes a good true story and has a few hours to spare for some great reading.<br /> The movie is worth viewing too. But, as the author reveals in an interview at the end of the book, the film is not completely accurate and is \\"Hollywoodized\\" in certain scenes. Abagnale, according to himself, actually conned more people, banks, airlines, and ladies than the film portrays. At the completion of this book I felt not only better prepared to become a con-artist myself, but to also aid in their capture as well.	2003-01-03

The leadership principles discussed by Giuliani are relevant and useful, but the book may be better titled as &quot;My Experiences in New York City.&quot; Each chapter simply examines his experiences working for the United States government and later for the city of New York and the challenges and decisions he faced. &quot;Leadership&quot; reads more like an autobiography than a book designed to provide one with the skills necessary to be a great leader. I look up to Giuliani and admire what he did for NYC, but I also think that there are better books out there if one is merely interested in leadership training, skills, and principles. &quot;Leadership&quot; is a good read however and I recommend it to anyone fascinated with New York City.	2002-12-31
