Morgan, included a fine hymn on the last page by composing his own thoughts into a verse form.<br /><br />You may be familiar with many of these hymns spanning 3 centuries but not with the story of the poets and musicians behind each one. Mr. Morgan has had a lifelong interest in hymnology.  He has researched and written about ordinary people who were given a great gift and we are all grateful.<br /><br />  Hymns have an impact on all our lives, so read this wonderful book slowly and thoughtfully and drink in the richness of the words as you apply them to your own life.  You'll be singing all day!  You'll feel a renewed appreciation for the words to such hymns as A Mighty Fortress Is Our God, Great Is Thy Faithfulness, The Hallelujah Chorus, When Morning Gilds The Skies, Jesus Loves Me, Near To The Heart Of God, and so many more, as well as for the authors such as Fanny Crosby, Charles Wesley, Isaac Watts, Thomas O. Chisholm, and dozens more.<br /><br />All I can say is, I greatly enjoyed this well organized book and it deserves a place in everyone's library.	2005-09-28

Caroline Kennedy captures, in more than 600 pages, the true spirit of our country since the beginning.  Her research and skill as a writer is amazing.  Her selections of speeches, songs, poems, true stories of patriots past and present are perfect for all ages and for both casual and serious readers.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - you will refer to it time and time again - as a gift book, it will be well received.  The author refers to her book as a collage of America.  There are many wonderful pictures, inspiring passages, and the outstanding song and poem collections about our country are just perfect!<br /><br />A resource book especially for American citizens that is easy to read, written by a well loved young American patriot is truly a treasure. I love it!  Thanks, Caroline.	2005-07-19

Lewis, and I loved it from the beginning. I am now reading other works by this author.<br /><br />I had purchased the illustrated book of this title, for younger children, recently and my five year old grandson was immediately enthralled when his mother read it to him (he now knows this book from memory!)  This prompted me to read the adult version.  The writing is so witty and understandable; I now understand why the entire series by this author is so popular, even after all these years. One of the reviews suggests it should be read at least three times in one's life, beginning at age five.  I agree.<br /><br />There are so many reviews detailing the content of this book of good and evil, of young children finding themselves in another world and learning how to cope; I cannot add much to them except to say, just take the plunge, read the book, and I guarantee you will thoroughly enjoy the adventure.	2005-07-19

From beginning to end this marvelous book is enlightening and exciting reading.  The gifted authors have produced a much needed companion to the Bible.<br /><br />Each book of the Bible becomes crystal clear.  I also  recommend Walking The Bible (yes literally walking thru the Bible lands) by Bruce Feiler.<br /><br />Meet The Bible is a devotional book, yet it is immediately so instructive you will, as I did during a recent illness, just keep reading thru to the finish.  I am buying several to share with family and friends.  What a masterpiece, in my opinion.<br /><br />I read the paperback edition, wished it were a leatherbound edition, and appreciated every one of the 686  pages, however, the last few books of the New Testament were shorter, especially Revelation, almost as if the writers were hurrying along.  I wanted to read and learn more!  There is nothing dull about the Bible now; after you read this book, or read it along with a book of the Bible, you will obtain a completely  different perspective as you contemplate the \\"whole picture\\"!<br /><br /> I loved every moment reading this book and gaining knowledge of human nature as pictured in the book of books, the Holy Bible.	2005-04-23

I have read this treasure over and over to my grandson, begining at age three.  I laugh just thinking about Gregory the goat!  I marvel at the imagination of the author who wrote it.<br /><br />Every child age 5 and under on my gift list is getting a copy of this book for Christmas.  Now it could be that I have a special love for goats, having raised several for a number of years, and...my grandson's father is named Gregory! Regardless,  every child will love the illustrations, the very funny story of the little goat's desire to please his parents, the visit to the town dump, the wise advice to the parents  from an elderly ram, and the surprise ending.  This is one funny book to read to little children!	2004-11-09

Crazy Horse?<br /><br />Until I read this book recently, I had little in depth  knowledge of either man. Stephen Ambrose is one of my favorite authors, and I want to read all his works. I finally settled down to read this American history book which is well researched, easy to read;, and thoroughly riveting throughout.<br /><br />George Armstrong Custer - his life and service in the Civil War, and later in Indian wars as the west opened up to make way for trains, telegraph, and settlers - what a character he was. Crazy Horse, a courageous Indian who rebelled and took revenge on the white man, and the sad sad history of our government and the breaking of treaties with the native peoples. Also - names and habits of various Indian tribes and how they differed, what they ate, their habits and their attitudes toward the white man.<br /><br />The author gives us a glimpse of what the American west looked liked when the Indians and buffalo were free.  Every page is carefully written in a \\"fair and balanced\\" manner. I greatly enjoyed reading it from cover to cover and have a much better understanding of America and the westward expeditions in the 1800's.<br /><br />Reading James Michener's great book \\"Centennial\\" a few years ago, may have prepared me and helped me to process the information in this interesting and factual book.  I recommend it. There are many surprises and plenty of action.	2004-10-01

From Washington to the present George Bush, the reader visits  the final resting places of our American presidents and learns how and when they died and their final words, in many cases.<br /><br />Altho this book was published before the death of Ronald Reagan, pictures of his library and of the other living presidents are discussed.<br /><br />In back of the book are names and places of the presidential libraries, the presidential and vice presidential gravesites listed by state, the burial places of president's wives and a host of other relevant material.

Students of American history may want to add this to their book list.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the American presidency and appreciate the valuable information that Brian Lamb and C-Span staff give us every day on the cable channels, you will absolutely enjoy this lively and well written book.

The research needed to discover these personal letters is documented.  I love this collection and the way all the letters are presented.<br />To quote from the author's father, David McCullough, \\"This is a book to pick up and read at almost any page, a book to keep close at hand, to return to for nourishment and guidance, yes, but also for reassurance and pure pleasure\\".  I couldn't have said it any better!  This quotation says exactly how I feel.  I want to purchase several copies to give as gifts and as a parent, I even feel compelled to write to my own children!<br />All the letters provide wonderful insights into the minds of the parents, and I have several favorites; Eleanor Roosevelt wrote one to one of her sons who wanted to skip Christmas and it is so touching!  As Dorie M. Lawson reminds us, letter writing is generally a thoughtful art - it cannot compare to e-mail writing.<br />These personal letters from parent to child are arranged thematically and within each section, they are in chronological order and printed in their entirety just as they were composed.  It is thrilling to read them, especially the really old ones and all of them were written by aparent who made worthwhile contributions to America.<br />Here are a few of the parents whose letters are included:  Thomas Jefferson to his daughter Patsy, Harry Truman to his daughter Margaret, General Patton to his son, Oscar Hammerstein to his son, and so many more from all walks of life. All of us who have children and even those who do not, will benefit from reading this rare collection of parents expressing their thoughts.<br />Thank you Dorie McCullough Lawson and please continue writing!	2004-07-19

I could not put this book down - I underlined - I sat and pondered over the columns and his insights on the world today - and I plan to give a copy of this rare book to each of my children.<br />Finally, a unique book about our world in the age of terrorism and America's role in it that is not partisan politics as usual. Every column is fair and balanced in my opinion. I marveled at how precise Tom Friedman writes, and how much common sense is apparent in his thinking as he reviews the past three years especially, and clarifies the big divide between freedom and radical fundamentalists.<br />Here is a quote from this writer at the end of the book:  &quot;How we learn to live in a world where technology every day is erasing more and more walls--making it so much easier to communicate, trade, and integrate, but also so much easier for small groups to reach around the world and wreak great havoc thousands of miles away--is the great challenge of the new century.<br />Some of his News York Times columns are &quot;letters&quot; he wishes the president to write to various foreign leaders.  They are gems, especially the one to Arafat and Sharon!  This freedom loving American should be in the White House as the top advisor to a president.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and learned so much from it - every American should read it and educate themselves about the middle East and the challenges we are facing this century.	2004-07-06

He was inspired to reach out and collect individual stories from those difficult years so we will never forget the horrors of that war, the sacrifices by our service men and women and their families, and the results that followed.<br />Finally, a memorial to this generation has been dedicated in Washington D.C. on this, the sixtieth anniversary of D-Day.  THE GREATEST GENERATION  should occupy a place in our home library, among the works of other historians. You will recognize some of the people in this book, you will be amazed at the achievements and the courage of these ordinary people who survived a perilous time in American history, and you will reflect on your own memories of that time if you are &quot;over sixty&quot;.<br />The author acquaints us with some of his own family history and why he feels it important for us to be forever grateful to all those who defend our American freedom and democracy.  I thoroughly enjoyed this well researched and well written book.	2004-05-31

The book begins in the early 1700's.  It ends when the presidency of George Washington ends and John Adams is elected, in 1797.<br />I appreciated the notes and the cast of characters including names of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, the signers of the Constitution, the players in the new government, women writers of the period, and famous soldiers and statesmen during the revolutionary war, which are included in the back of the book.<br />Excerpts from many letters are included and are so beautifully written.Let your imagination wander as you read vivid accounts of the sacrifices made by families who wanted independence from England - the yellow fever and smallpox epidemics, the building of a military, the contributions made by exceptional women such as Abigail Adams and Martha Washington, as well as Phillis Wheatley, Mercy Otis Warren, Sarah Livingston Jay, and many others portrayed here.<br />Cokie writes as if she is having fun telling us so many interesting facts about the \\"founding families\\", and I had fun learning more about them and relearning early American history.<br />The true story of Benedict Arnold and his wife was enlightening as well as the character of Alexander Hamilton.<br />You will enjoy learning about influential women in this book.<br />Cokie has inserted some of her own remarks to lighten up the picture, and she carefully recounts the contributions of each state as they represented the new government at that time; the<br />conflicts with the British,the alliance with the French, as well as inevitable partisan politics.	2004-05-07

I love the tricky title &quot;It's Not About Me&quot;.  After all these years - most of us thought it was!<br />The editorial reviews are so well done, I can do little to improve them.  This is a small engrossing book that explores why we are here on earth in the first place - it is to reflect the glory of God.  For anyone who has never read a Max Lucado book, and there are several, I recommend this one first.  I have read two others and plan to read them all.  They are not &quot;preachy&quot; nor difficult to understand.  They are written by a humble Christian pastor who never fails to give credit to his wife and children for their support and encouragement.<br />This book touches a chord in all of us as we often forget our Creator and how much He loves us.  Once you are rescued from a life of self-promotion, self-preservation and self-centeredness, and realize you are here to reflect God's glory, your life becomes changed.  This book makes a wonderful gift and it deserves a place in your library where you can reread it often.	2004-04-19

Cohen, a survivor of multiple sclerosis and colon cancer, because he deserves to be heard. He is strong through adversity.  His wife is his best friend, his loyal partner, and obviously wants to share the inspiring story of her admiration for Richard Cohen and the strength of their family.<br />Mr. Cohen develops his &quot;reluctant memoir&quot; as he refers to his book, in a realistic way. All of us will face some sort of adversity at one time or another during our short time on this earth. Read this engrossing story in order to learn this man's coping mechanisms.  He continues to deal with worsening symtoms of this disease, teach his children to be understanding and compassionate towards others, work constantly on being optimistic in the face of uncertainty about his medical conditions, and give his opinions and insights on just about everything.<br />The effects of this progressive disease on his wife and three children are told with honesty and concern.  He is a skillful writer, an independent thinker, and discourages any sympathy one might have for him.<br />As I read this timely book through in just two sittings, I counted my blessings and gave thanks to our God for His peace which passes all understanding.  None of us are promised a &quot;rose garden&quot; in this life, but we are promised a &quot;Presence&quot; to comfort us, if we ask.  There is no mention in this book of a spiritual journey.  I hope he writes another book with  a mention of that type of journey as well as a thanks and a mention of all those who have assisted and encouraged  him these past 3 decades - for without them, I doubt he could be the &quot;overcomer&quot; he daily strives to be.	2004-04-18

Not only does he share some of his personal stories, but he gives us his thoughts about several other famous writers whom  he respects.<br />James Michener is a genius, in my opinion.  His book, Centennial, remains my favorite, however, I own many of his books and recommend them to all serious readers.  His writing style is easy to read and comprehend; he combines historical facts with some fiction and creates a masterpiece.<br />In this book of wonderful little stories and analysis, is his classic piece entitled &quot;Who Is Virgil T. Fry&quot;. It's great!<br />James Michener is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and many of his books were made into movies.  He wrote over seven decades and traveled widely.  A most extraordinary man, he tells us in this, his last book, about several authors, poets, and books that determined his attitudes concerning novels, styles of writing, and how his own style of writing was shaped.<br />Once you have read a James Michener novel, you will be hooked!<br />His research, his insights, and his genius for story telling will thrill you from the beginning and this book, his last, written in 1993, is a treasure.	2004-04-14

Cokie Roberts is an attractive lady from a large family of achievers.  She shares part of her life story with the reader and writes  valuable information in the form of essays, about amazing women past and present; many of whom we have not been aware of.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this easy to read book. I recommend it as encouragement to all women especially those hiding their talents.<br />Mostly though, it is a reassuring book  in that we women  are reminded to appreciate each other, ever learning, ever discovering new ways to contribute, even if our best efforts go unnoticed for a time;  willing to step back or go forward as the need arises, and always share the credits.<br />With all due respect to the author, I find the title to be unworthy of this fine book.  I am my daughter's mother; some women have no daughters, some daughters have no mother to encourage them - anyway perhaps I haven't gotten the point.  Do read this book, enjoy it, and give it your own title!	2004-04-13

It should be required reading as an overview of our country with its movers and shakers, heroes and villians, mistakes and progress, for all our leaders - the president included!<br />I was impressed by the fact that this worthy historian is unashamed to admit his own bias in some cases  and how he eventually changes his thinking as he makes new discoveries.<br />He compares a number of presidents and their leadership, as well as taking us to the battlefields with America's brave fighting men. Thanks to this author and his numerous books, and to Tom Brokaw, we will not be allowed to forget the price paid by the veterans in all our wars.<br />Wonderful stories, interesting reflections from a well-educated professor and historian, and a great book for a discussion group.

Karen Hughes has a refreshing personality as she appears on television and her book is interesting and genuine. I admire many women who have and are now serving in the government. Karen Hughes is unlike any of them - her confidence in her ability and wisdom is honestly portrayed in this book.<br />The first part is her own biography.  The second part which explains the presidential campaign and her subsequent job in the administration is very frank and readable.  The last chapter is rather lengthy as she gives her opinions on the state of the union as managed by the Republican administration of which she is so fond.<br />A very confident woman, Karen Hughes simply forges ahead and does her job with great gusto.  Her greatest accomplishment, in my opinion, is marrying her husband who has allowed her to do exactly as she pleases and who takes care of the children better than she, apparently. What a man!<br />I gave this book 4 stars because reading it left me almost breathless! As a mother of 4 children, a small business owner, and a woman of faith myself,  (as she describes her faith thruout this book) I could never imagine anyone, man or woman, accomplishing all she writes within such a whirlwind. I thought I had high energy and was indispensable! She got little sleep,worked seven days a week, almost non stop with cell phone in her hand, leaves the impression that the president cannot possibly live more than an hour or so without her advice and wisdom, makes attempts to cook. exercise, and love her children on rare occasions;  flies anywhere at a moment's notice, runs a large staff at the white house, fires off orders after making quick decisions, remembers her husband occasionally, never argues with anyone because she will win anyway, and is indispensable to everyone.  Now that is a superwoman!  All that and she remains likeable!  I like her too!<br />I congratulate this busy creative and talented woman for leaving the white house and those long long hours of input. It had to be a tough decision.

Everyone can benefit from quiet reflection, from reading scripture, from singing hymns, and from praying.  We all have the freedom to worship God in different ways. Kathleen Norris was curious about the catholic faith, although she remains a protestant. Her experience within the monastery is beneficial to her soul and she describes how, as a poet and writer, the rituals, liturgy, and hospitality within the monastic setting further her own understanding of spirituality.	2004-02-23

His supportive wife accompanies him to Alaska and establishes a home base in Seward, Alaska for a year and a half.  Various family members visit them, go on side trips, and their youngest daughter attends school there.  He ventures out to watch the fisherman catch salmon, camps near a glacier with a daughter, takes a long ride with a conflicted woman, and acquaints himself with the Alaskan government, and other things.<br />The book is interesting but far too lengthy. There are repetitions.  One nice touch is the inclusion of journal entries by daughter Rebekah as she enjoys excursions both with her Dad and alone. She will be a marvelous writer in the future.<br />Most of us here in the lower 48 are familiar with Alaska - the beauty, the cold, the wildlife, the oil pipeline, the salmon fishing, glaciers, and so many things unique to this state. Peter Jenkins leads the reader to believe he enjoys  personal risk as he makes friendly with strangers and writes down their life stories for us. Many are worth reading but could be condensed.  He doesn't seem to mind risking the lives of his family either.  It's all part of the Alaska experience to him, loneliness, darkness, attacks from the wildlife, pot smoking hippie groups, bar scenes, as well as magnificent scenery and flying with the bush pilots across the endless white terrain.<br />Included in his travelogue is a trip into the bush with his father in law, an avid hunter whose idea of a thrill of a lifetime is killing an Alaskan moose.  He does and he receives his thrill.  This reader was not thrilled.<br />Along with stories of people living in Alaska trying  to find themselves and enjoying their own pity parties,  there were two memorable accounts  of folks moving to this challenging state  to give something of themselves to help others - the school teachers who moved to Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost city, to teach the native children and the veterinarian who lives deep in the bush but near a beautiful lake. He journeys far and wide in the area to tend to the animals and help others.Satellite telephones and access to the internet make living in Alaska far easier than ever before.<br />The author did not include any stories of the polar bear or cruise ship adventures. The account of the dog mushers was, in my opinion, the best one in the book. Salmon fishing was well described.<br />There is a map of Alaska in the beginning of the book for reference. The long book is worth reading if one is thinking about spending a year in the state, tho it does not cover the state in entirety.  I, for one, will continue  watching the Discovery Channel for Alaskan stories and reading more true adventures, eating salmon caught in Alaskan waters and keeping warm in New Jersey. I hope Peter Jenkins finds what he is searching for someday.

I located a copy recently and began reading a very interesting almost year by year description of this man's controversial and never dull life.<br />The first one hundred pages feature a lengthy portrait of a young man growing up in the twenties and thirties with little money, a thirst for learning and adventure (he enjoyed summers as a hobo riding the rails across America) and dreams of becoming a writer of novels and plays.  I had never heard of John Toland and was beginning to dislike him a little, especially after he shares his experiences as an enlisted man in the army and appears to be rather boastful. He never sees combat.  He is in the entertainment division and directs shows for the soldiers at American training camps.  He did, however, apply for and received officer's training. I realize now he simply made the most of the jobs he was given.<br />Eventually, I came to admire him as he was always ambitious, took advantage of  opportunities, and began to write non fiction beginning with a book entitled Ships In The Sky, about  dirigibles.  Suddenly he realized he could use his writing talent as a historian and thus began, in his forties, to give us the real deal, based on extensive research with real people, of what the world was like during the thirties and forties and beyond.<br />The remainder of the book deals with his research and interviews with each of his books of historical non fiction and I felt as if I were reading The History Channel !  His second wife, Toshiko, is to be admired for her loyalty and dedication to her husband.  She transcribed, typed, encouraged and was with him all the way as he tells us about The Battle of the Bulge, The Rise and Fall of the Japanese Empire, Adolph Hitler, the Last 100 days of World War II, and many others.  He even writes a book about John Dillinger and his criminal life in America.  In fact he was so eager to write that he looked forward to a next book immediately after completing one.<br />There is a difference in this author.  He interviewed literally hundreds of people on both \\"sides\\" of his subject. He doesn't insert his \\"self\\" but lets the person, be it Adolph Hitler's relative, Tito's wife, or a German general, tell their story from their viewpoint.  After reading this book, I now want to read other books by this author.  He doesn't insert his own judgments.  His chapters on each of his books are not boring at all but rather eye-opening.  If truth is stranger than fiction, here it is.<br />This is not a book one picks up and reads straight thru.  In fact, much of it is depressing.  What a waste World War 2 was. What a loss of life.  why?  Can this generation make similar mistakes? Questions, questions.  This is thought provoking material.<br />I recommend this book for readers who love good autobiographies. Since John Toland kept meticulous records, tapes of interviews, had excellent organization with his notes, and just lets the facts speak for themselves, I feel as if I have read an honest book about a troubled time in world history.  I also deeply appreciated his \\"clean\\" writing.  He doesn't resort to offensive language.  I feel he deserved the pulitzer prize and other awards he rightly received for his informative books.o write that he looked forward to a next book immediately after completing one.<br />There is a difference in this author.

This one is (alas!) another departure from his thrilling fiction involving lawyers.  If you are a fan of John Grisham, you will appreciate his attempts to vary his material and keep reading!<br />I read this book in just a couple hours.  There are some surprises of course as this author is known for luring us on to read until the end.  Place yourself back in high school, remembering the football team and how important it is to most small towns especially.  Winning at any cost is the aim of the coach in this story. The star quarterback and other members of a football team meet many years later at the funeral of their coach and relate stories of their lives since high school.<br />You may experience, as I did, your own high school memories as you read this book through the eyes of athletes.  My own small town had a coach with a winning football streak through several years and my town worshipped him with a new car and other perks similar to the way this town and this coach in the story are depicted.<br />I recommend this book as a nice diversion.  It leaves much to the imagination.  It contains a lot of truth and insights. You can trust John Grisham to write stories we can think about later and relate to them.  I liked it.	2003-11-28

Imagine leisurely exploring an entire country on horseback!<br />There are several pictures in brilliant color depicting the diverse people, the spectacular scenery including magnificent snow capped  mountains and swift large rivers, and many black and white pictures as well, enabling us to join in the ride.<br />Robin and Louella Hanbury-Tenison explored this magical country on horseback together and vividly describe their adventures, sharing them with readers who love true and exciting accounts. Proceeds from their expedition raised money for charity entitled Riding for the Disabled.  They are an English couple with environmental concerns as well.  This journey is one of many as they explored other parts of the world in other books.<br />This book also provides insights into the economic and environmental problems in New Zealand. You will learn a great deal of the country's history.<br />Imagine riding horses up high mountain peaks covered with snow and then descending to the hot dry valley floors, seeing native animals up close, talking with shepherds and owners of the huge sheep farms, sleeping in various kinds of weather both outside and sometimes inside primitive huts, grazing horses, basking in lush natural surroundings in what they call \\"the most beautiful country in the world\\"!  As you read this highly descriptive book, you can almost smell that sharp fresh air after a rain and see the colorful rainbows, all the while riding in a comfortable saddle on eager healthy horses. The entire country is well described in every way possible.<br />Want to take a journey to a special land on horseback?  For a true adventure story you will not forget, read this book and others written by Robin Hanbury-Tenison, an explorer extraordinare!	2003-11-21

This fascinating journey was begun on November 2, 1950.  I doubt it could be done now.  For hair-raising adventure on the Nile river from the true source at the headsprings of the Kagera River traveling by muscle power only,  4,145 miles to  Rosetta,a port town, at the mouth of the Nile on the Mediterranean sea; this exciting exploration is so interesting you may be unable to put it down until finished.  It's that riveting! John Goddard and his two traveling companions risked their lives on this great river with its variety of animals, weather, peoples, and terrain, in kayaks.  They became known as the three Nileteers!  They were also the first to document their journey from the true source of the river. The reader actually feels a part of the journey.<br />What a difference there must be within this long stretch of Africa along the great river today, a half century later.<br />This book is a true learning experience.  Seldom does a reader chance upon a book so well written and documented  that one will never forget.  Descriptions of the peoples along the river are amazing.	2003-11-21

She survived the inevitable media criticism with dignity and does not use this memoir to \\"get even\\".<br />Americans cannot dismiss her efforts to inform us about world problems, especially women and children's issues. She writes about her many travels throughout the world, her friends she made in high places, her ability to listen, and her personal trials.<br />The first part of the book is interesting as the author relates her early years, college experiences, and her move to Arkansas. Keep in mind, Hillary Rodham Clinton was just a plain ordinary girl growing up in the midwest who made choices which led her on a path straight to the white house and a place in history as first lady. She devised a plan and worked it.<br />The book deserves a 5 star rating since it thoroughly describes the eight years of the Clinton presidency from her point of view, and will be valuable for the next generation as they study and judge it. The second part of the book is too long in my opinion for us who lived through these eight years of history and had to endure the endless investigations and partisan politics. Mrs. Clinton describes her feelings well and one wonders why there were so many roadblocks in her life at the white house.<br />Hillary Clinton attempts to humanize herself in this book.  She wanted to make a difference and to do it \\"her way\\".  She wanted to be outstanding and set a precedent for other first ladies to follow. (this may not be a wise thing)  She traveled extensively, mostly without her husband it seems.  One wonders if she had stayed at home more and limited herself to what she could actually accomplish, perhaps she could have avoided the harsh criticism she received in the media.  Perhaps her husband wouldn't have gotten \\"caught\\".  She gives us a glimpse into her private life with her complex husband but she is not quite  believable in this area.<br />Mrs. Clinton wisely wrote her memoir as first lady quickly, so we would \\"get the facts straight\\". She adequately covered those facts.  She is a woman of determination and self confidence. Some reviews indicate she is\\"inspiring\\".  I was not inspired by her nor do I stand in awe of her except for the fact she could endure trauma and put on a brave public face. I have memoirs by several first ladies. Hillary Clinton is only one of many outstanding women. She is controversial because she appears to lack warmth of spirit. I felt closer to the real Hillary when reading her excellent book \\"It Takes A Village\\".<br />My review and personal opinion of this book is from the standpoint of a female senior citizen who votes independently. I do not find this author to be \\"formidable\\".  I enjoyed reading of her visits to other countries and her impressions.  I believe she is mostly honest as she writes and edits her book.  I admire her for attending the women's conference in China.  I am pleased she has such a good relationship with Chelsea.  I wondered tho, why she feels she has to constantly remind us of her \\"great\\" husband and his attempt to \\"change\\" America.  Some other first ladies have excessively praised their husbands in their memoirs and I felt it unnecessary.  I want to know about what life is like for a president's wife and how she can best be a role model for other women. Eleanor Roosevelt used her position to educate women and was genuinely interested in America.  Mrs. Clinton takes a worldview of women's roles and this is also good.<br />We can expect another memoir of Hillary's senate experiences which hopefully will not include her husband's input.<br />Hillary Clinton includes insights concerning her Christian faith.  She tells us of her experiences in Methodist youth groups when she was young and that her faith sustains her.  I would like to add to this review a Bible verse found in 1 Peter 4:10  \\"Each one should use whatever gift he (she) has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.\\"  Go Hillary.grace in its various forms.\\"  Go Hillary.	2003-11-18

A few weeks ago the Doles and Clintons gave speeches in Washington D.C. and I happened to hear them on C-span.  Dole's dead pan humor and hilarious one liners actually made me laugh out loud!  Later that day I purchased this book which is quite good.<br />After  researching all the American presidents, Dole  rates them from the funniest to least funny. Some of the best lines are from prominent people other than the president. There is a saying (not in this book) &quot;Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves, for they shall never cease to be amused&quot;!Some of our presidents, fortunately, have been likeable, intelligent and quite witty.  This fine collection of humorous quips and anecdotes makes an excellent gift for all ages. Bob Dole's remarks are right on!<br />My reason for the 4 star rating is for one reason only: Since most of us remember the faces of only a few past presidents, a small picture of the president being quoted at the beginning of each chapter would have been a nice touch. Dates are included which is helpful as we relate to each presidential term while reading.<br />The introduction to this book is entitled &quot; Backbones and Funny Bones&quot;  In this intro, Bob Dole expresses his views on presidential humor with rare insight and he provides us with his &quot;Dole poll of presidential wit and humor&quot; in a non-partisan way.  41 presidents are rated as humorists along with a brief  discription of why.  This is a gem.	2003-11-17

The secret life of the amazing honey bee depicted within an original southern novel with twists and turns, words of wisdom, and amazing characters.  The reviews are right on target - the book is a classic, for all ages.  It may help to read The Magic School Bus, Inside A Beehive by Joanna Cole after reading this!<br />The author created a masterpiece when she spun this beautiful story.It is satisfying.

A delightful memoir by a distinguished man who also co-authored The Story of English. He is co-anchor of the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour.<br />I bought it a few years ago out of curiousity - and have shared  and recommended it to friends who appreciate a well written book with lots of surprises.  This man loves words and the power of words,  He was raised in Nova Scotia by a mother who read and provided books for him, introducing him to the world of poetry and the love of learning.<br />How appropriate this book is for today when literacy and reading books is being emphasized, finally.  I think the brilliant author deserves more recognition and his  thoroughly enjoyable book should be reprinted and made more easily available.<br />You will not be disappointed in this book.  It is a treasure to keep and reread as time goes by.<br />Thanks Mr. MacNeil for sharing with us your uplifting story.	2003-11-07

This is real information, very exciting, and uplifting.  Thru this book I have now crossed the Red Sea, rode a camel, climbed Mt. Sinai, and literally felt I was taking the walk too.

I had to read the entire book straight thru - it captivated me, informed me, and made me eager for more.  It is easy to read, very spellbinding, and I recommend it to all who like reading fiction that seems to be too real to be fiction.<br />Books by James Michener, such as Centennial, give me this same feeling.

I love her descriptions of the Italian countryside, her recipes, her personal thoughts and the very fact she took time to share so much with us.<br />  Get comfortable and go on a journey to Tuscany  reading a great non fiction book.  Once there, your imagination will take over.  You will feel that sun, pick olives, taste the wine and the delicious variety of Italian food, go on drives up and down the mountains, visit the little towns, climb stone walls, walk on roads built by ancient peoples, spend time in the many churches and museums and marvel at the art.<br />You may think remodeling a house in America is quite a job but wait until you read how Frances Mayes makes a huge old stone fortress (?) into a comfortable and inviting home.  She makes so many decisions, meets her neighbors, and eventually becomes part of the community.<br />This book, and her other books, allow us to share her excitement and adventures in this country in a unique way.

I do applaud this young author for taking a stand, alerting us to future danger, and providing warning signs to the younger generation so they will make better leaders. Keep on writing.

He sure is a breath of fresh air.  I think maybe he really is \\"looking out for the folks\\". Please don't disappoint us, Mr. O'Reilly - stay fair and balanced. The only way \\"the folks\\" will listen to you is if you remain civil.<br />The  author could have introduced much more new information and made the book longer - a portion of the book is a repeat of his nighttime show, but only a small portion. I may read his other books some time in the future just because he is unafraid to speak out against injustice. America and the world at large should be grateful to this man.	2003-11-03

I plan to read all of David McCullough's books.<br />BRAVE COMPANIONS is a wonderful easily readable book of interesting in depth portraits of people with a purpose. The author makes his portrayals come alive in a unique way. You will learn how history was shaped by ordinary people who did amazing things. I was familiar with only a few such as Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles and Anne Lindbergh, and was so pleasantly surprised to read about many others such as Miriam Rothschild and David Plowden. I am happy to have met  all of these different and exceptional folks. The last chapter, Simon Willard's Clock is just plain great!<br />Be warned - when you begin reading this informative book, you will not stop until completing it and you will want to know even more about each subject - it's that good!

No matter what church you attend or what your philosphy of life is, you will relate to the town of Mitford and its cast of characters. Father Tim is like a trusted comfortable friend. Words cannot express my admiration for this author and her insights.<br />This is a book you want to go back to and memorize some parts, underline passages, and just apply the nuggets of wisdom to your own life.<br />I strongly recommend this book - it is food for the soul - makes you feel happy inside.	2003-10-30

She recounts her journal entries from the past decade and takes us with her all over the world.  She supports worthwhile causes, gives generously of her time, gets excited about her family, acknowledges the special bond between her and George W. Bush, counts her blessings and is unafraid to \\"tell it like it is\\".  How refreshing.<br />If you enjoy reading non fiction and would like to take a peak into the life of a former first lady, get  comfortable and read this one thru.  It is a happy book mostly,a true account of the author's feelings as written in her journals year by year  and lots of asides that will make you laugh.<br />Mrs. Bush enjoys reading and supplies us with some of her favorite books.  I thought she could have included more non fiction and would have appreciated a listing of her favorites in the back of her book.  There are some recipes,  accounts of visitors at Kennebunkeport, vacations on Greek islands, travels to China and many other countries spiced up with tales of family and friends that will entertain and inform you<br /><br />Barbara Bush appears to be a down to earth realist  and she continues to work tirelessly for her causes which are literacy and education. She chose a pleasant, easy, elegant style in her role as first lady. You'll be amazed at her energy, her insights, her devotion and loyalty to her family, how she is coping with health problems, and how many speeches she gives.<br />Curious about Barbara?  Read the book.  She doesn't disappoint.	2003-10-30

Your writing style is brilliant and deserving of praise. I was captivated from the beginning.<br />Sing Me To Heaven, the Story of a Marriage, is the perfect title.  It is a unique story written by an obviously  gifted author who, in an intelligent and sincere way, details her memories of shared times and solitary times during her marriage to a fine young man who had the misfortune to be HIV positive.<br />I find the book to be thought provoking. Read it as I did, with an open mind, and you'll see.	2003-10-29
