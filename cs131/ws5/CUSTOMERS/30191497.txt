The book will capture those very emotions that humanity says we all should experience when dealing with subjects that are mind wrenching and horrific.  Mr. Graves , the investigator, has found ample evidence based on facts presented  to suggest that our government, military, political, and medical industrial complexes have worked in conjunction to produce viruses that are population reducing and deadly to specific groups while other factions attempt to cover up the evidence or just remain unusually silent.  The book in chocked full of incriminating evidence, from the nine years of research and detective work the author has done , with the slam dunk or missing link being the 1971 flowchart which conclusively shows \\"20,000 scientific papers which conclusively prove a candidate virus was developed and mass produced.\\"  The initial part of the book starts with the history of the development of aids ( you will be surprised) and the major players involved, (you will be shocked).  These individuals make sure the project is carried on as planned.  Then the research ends  and the court battle begins, with  copies of letters to leading officials and powerful individuals.  Finally  ending with the court cases filed by Mr.  Graves, the lawyer.  I found the research well documented, with new information densely  packed in this 259 paged book.  A shocking look at the truth.	2005-09-30

Well this publication is one fantastic piece of work.  It is chocked full of information geared toward the street hustling urbanite smarty who wants to get ahead, although it applies to all who are thinkers.  The advice given is practical, realistic, and poetry  inspired.  What&#8217;s more the definition of hustling is in the introduction, so that  you don&#8217;t have to think you are a hustler, you can know right from the beginning,  what you are doing.   Chapter Two is worthy of reading especially if you&#8217;re an educated fool, and no the author is not against education,  just individuals who think a job equals success and security.   There are some  awesome chapters on business, marriage, and going broke.  All in all this is good  teaching  material for the success minded.  <br />	2005-09-29

In addition there is no call by the author to have repairs made to descendents of slaves for which most wealthy  families of America and England benefited according to Mr. Coleman .  However despite that , very relevant points are made and  a considerable amount of events discussed have come to pass, are currently happening and or measures are put in place so that some events will present themselves soon.  The author seemingly put great detail and thought in telling the tale that is told and appears to be very compassionate, knowledgeable, forthcoming with his variety of information.  I would very much like to know what happened in his life that would make an ex MI6 agent spill the beans. <br />	2005-09-11

The author links various Afrikan pagan spiritual faiths and gods to each other  (JuJu, Voodoo,  Odemare, Sun Worship, Afrikan holy trinity) to  all the major western religions, as well as to music such as jazz and gospel.  It is comprehensive in scope and very historical in perspective, examining each major religions relationships by chapter.  One thing for sure, is that  there is not one single religion on earth conceived, invented, maintained, helped along without Afrikans as major players, real and mythological to help spread the gospel and make modern religion what it is today. The author gives excellent bibliographical references for those who are critics to see for themselves.      <br />	2005-09-11

The down shifters  that are profiled by the author are an interesting group  and most live in the pacific northwest although increasingly they live all over.   These guys have opted out of the excessive consumerism that we all let ourselves be subject to and have made significant changes in their lives.  They  do things like voluntarily take lower paying jobs to have more freedom, time with friends, family and self,  refuse promotions, stop working altogether, drive older cars, not attend first run movies, don&#8217;t shop in malls, move to smaller housing in less expensive neighborhoods, shop at thrift stores and flee markets.   As once overspent Americans, the  down shifters have reasoned that the work and spend cycle has left them stressed out and largely with nothing to show for it.  Chapter six gets down to the business of how the shop-a-holics, and status seekers can hopefully get a handled on the excessive spending.  There is a list of organization in back to help those who a seeking  to be more knowledgeable.   Overall, very good research into why we do what we do and how to  help ourselves.   <br />	2005-09-03

The author sets the record straight by linking all three to their Afrikan  pagan origins and with real individuals, making historical corrections where they are due.  For example there are comparisons, between  what was allegedly said by King Solomon and what was actually written by Amenemope, and comparison between the biblical ten commandments with the actual written 147.  There are dates along with mapping diagrams showing the approximate time of genesis and exodus and what would have occurred in truth.  In addition, by showing that all involved during the alleged mass movements and cultural war fares were of Afrikan tribal descent,  the  author shows that biblical  events that occurred were mostly Afrikan continental  history, and spiritual allegory. A  very good reference source with a great bibliography.  For more detail see African Origins of the Major Western Religions to get an  in-depth outlook on this subject.	2005-08-30

Ms Ehrenrieich's project proved very fruitful and if there was a point about the economy to be  made  her research definitely made it.   As a writer living a middle class suburban lifestyle  she set out to  prove how low wage earners were surviving on  the wages most companies were paying the supposed unskilled laborer.  On location in Florida, Maine and Minnesota the author was hired for various unskilled jobs and discovered that  it was difficult for the average worker at the level researched to make ends meet.  Some conclusions  by the Economic Policy Institute  and the author was that  the economy was the problem and that it would take a family  of one adult and two children, 30,000 to live on.   That of course does not include very much meat nor internet services.   There is a very good evaluation at the end and some of her stories are very funny.  <br />	2005-08-23

Ade Ajayi	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Nice Historical Review	Fantastic general overview of the West African Region, from 1000 to 1800 AD.  The author and his colleagues offers the reader a vivid look at the ever evolving western  African civilizations from research obtained from eye witnesses, archeological research, oral and tradition histories from the various tribes.  It appears by all accounts that the pre-slave dominated market societies were very sophisticated with their way of living ie, there was advanced agriculture, cattle farming, fishing, horse raising, technical skill societies that fueled the unique economies.  Also political, educational systems based on age-sets and spiritual systems were set in place for thousand of years.   Consequently you will be informed of the various city states, kingdoms, empires that were formed, their rise to power and the reasons why they fell.  Plus the importance of the various outside religions that were forced on the indigenous populations and the role they played with the successes and failures of various regions.  Overall a relatively unbiased  overview with excellent  bibliographical sources. <br />	2005-08-21

After a world lit only by fire this is a great segue into what happened to the medieval mind during the reconnaissance years and one continents horrific adventure...Once the euro forces wrestled control of the Mediterranean and the North African waterways from the Arabs and the African moors they used the technology to sail to other continents,  in this case  Africa in the late 1400's to early 1500's.  Secondly control of trading routes were disrupted and eventually taken out of the Africans control.  Third once other land was discovered in the western hemisphere free labor was needed to work it&#8230;with control of trading routes, the outsiders were able to impose the type of merchandise to be traded...this massive trade helped the invaders move from a economically and socially backward geo-political system to a full fledged capitalist system , while causing an African brain drain  (ages 14 to 30) of massive proportions and depopulation of the highest order.  One of conscious mind could only look in horror as boatloads of emaciated children pulled up to ports.  These were the poster children for the age of unreason and of course this was with the help of the bamboozled chiefs  and the mulatto class.  Although there were a few empires that launched kicka@#s offensives, the war was already lost. The Africans failed to see the world picture that the enemy saw. Once trading in slavery commenced on a massive scale , merchants got paid on a billion dollar scale...taking profits and moving those profits to other investments... such as technology, colonial corporations etc&#8230;, and on to the next phase of raw oppression . Under colonialism the medieval men choked off every single surplus of the peasant farmers and raw materials the workers had and mined sending billons  home. The combination of slavery and colonialism caused  massive famines,  disease outbreaks, wars, and indigenous systems were arrested . In other words the model that the medieval population now capitalists brought and originated from, took a mere 500 years  to transport elsewhere.<br /><br />Lets be real clear regarding the type of development that was allegedly brought...it was economic.  For when the medieval invaders reached their targeted geo area they had already found social development too advance for them to fathom...for unlike the military invading force, this areas people were very healthy and able to feed themselves, had an educational system in place, little to no crime, and political administrations.<br /><br />One could only hope the  land that launch intellect and spirituality  can muster up forces to alleviate its current situation based on its past.  This is an excellent read.	2005-07-31

Everything affects and is affected by everything else.\\"  This of course we know is very clear!!!    Taking place shortly after the downfall of the roman empire, Europe was in kaos from the medieval age to the renaissance.  However during that time there was a continuation of the Greco-roman empire, (Europes most advanced civilization) thru the renaissance of more of the same.  This age was as barbaric as any could get...the interpretation of Christianity was flawed in scope and where applied was brutal, reckless, domineering.  The aristocracy was corrupt, greedy incestrous, murderous...the general populace, diseased, savage, ignorant, starving.  The order of the day, warlords attacking each other for assets in every portion of the euro vicinity...the author describes the time from 400 ad to 1500 ad, an awful long time to be in this condition...Prison, well no, execution by way of burning at the stake, slash and quarter, beheadings, the use of the jungfer (this sent a 1000 chills up my spine) was the norm.  Some of the most evolved individuals, such as Martin Luther, Leonardo di Vinci, Nicolus Copernicus, Sir Thomas Moore, Eramas, exploring advances and taking the church to task were murdered, discredited, assassinated banished.  OH MY EUROPE WUZZ OFF THA CHAIN...For anthing different beyond their world was inconceivable.  The once awesome pied piper was actually a psychopathic child dismembering murderer, robin hood was actually a cold blooded rogue and guinevere, well it is questionable as to whether she was even real.  During their age of reconnaissance folk like Magellen sailing to the east and the Medici's sailing to the south for merchandise (they had the monopoly on slavery) took this whipa@#&s attitude all over once they discovered how to navigate by trial and error...If you are very sensitive about your Christianity, this one is not for you,if you are a feminist, well you will be offended by the fact that women and children were ranked near the bottom next to the dead dog buried in the back yard.  However, if you are up to a mind boggling history that borders on the unbelievable, well William Manchester is your man......	2005-07-02

That being said Richard Erdoes writes a fantastic historical-narrative on the euro landscape thru the eyes of a monk named Gerbert,aka Pope Sylvester. He also describes the trials and tribulations of the population from ad 800 to ad 1000 as they stumble thru life trying to make sense of the carnage, famine, cannibalisms (Putin forgot this part of his history), pestilences, and other madnesses that plagued every portion of the continent. He devotes chapters to countries so that the readers might get a good understanding of each geographical area and its tribe...For example chapter five is excellent as it devotes some time to explaining the advances in Spain and how the African Arabized Moors and the Arab tribes also known as the Saracens brought advancements to the area...for which Gerbert received most of his advanced training beyond the monastary.  For this area was one of the most populus and best cultured areas in Europe and was one of few able to feed its population.  Constantinople following Spain was the next best place to be.  Other chapters on italy, scandinavia, germany, france and the russian-hungarian east are profiled in very good detail. Of course some of the works best highlights are the murder, mayheim, papal intrigue and establishment corruptions that were prevalent. Good summation of a revised history though not a particularly schlolarly one.	2005-07-02

Not the best social economic labor book that I've read but Rifkin has done a credible job of explaining the inevitable in next century labor economics.  There is a special chapter for those groups affected by urban gentrification, world economic changes and policies.  The author has good examples of what happens when work is limited, mobile and international, when labor is cheap expendable and desrepected...when corporate environments perpetuate greed, corruption and destruction....	2005-04-09

This book by far is one of my all time favorates.  I had no idea how much more frugal I could deliberately be and feel good about it.  Ms. Luhrs addresses almost every important part of peoples lives that can be improved or modified deliberately and by choice.  However the book can be a stretch for those, who just love lavish luxury, those who live is big expensive cities and not likely to want to change.	2005-04-09

A continuation of Black labor White wealth, this account is a program of action for those interested with the implimentaion of the economic model based on Powernomics and the fascinating industries available for exploitation within certain communities.  Additionally this addition has updated stats and excellent examples of programs designed to help control-preserve community economic development and culture as well as history...to protect communities from outsiders with their own interests thru ethno-aggregation and consolidation urban communities can learn to impliment basic protective procedures.  Fascinating far reaching analysis, that should be of interest for those areas facing population displacement thru gentrification.  If developed properly this Powerenomics plan can serve areas well into the next century and beyond.	2005-04-09

Well the answer to these questions and more is contained in Stolen Legacy.  The simple fact of the matter is, the Greeks went to school elsewhere, did not complete the curriculum, left early, came back with invading armies, took important documents, destroyed others, assigned their names, their friends names and other unknown persons names, etc., laid claim to information that could not have possibly been obtained in one's lifespan.  A ground breaking book...has yet to be discredited.	2005-04-08

One of the best historical accounts of guerrilla warfare in the western hemisphere that I have ever read.  All the major players, Toussaint, Dessallines (my favorate), Jean Francois, Beavais, etc.,  all were intelligent thinkers able to plan and execute the most detailed of military info.  The most amazing part about these men were that they were mostly ex-enslaved, maroons, determined to have freedom at all cost.  It didnt matter what the maritime french bouguoise had in store for them, the Black Jacobins had other plans. Additionally, it was too bad that the mulattoes chose bad decisions in there fight for freedom for it almost led to their extermination.  All in all a great document, a must read.  Pay close attention to the brutal tactics of the slave holders, and their desires to make examples of rebellious slaves, hitler was to use them years later. hummm.	2005-03-27

I was surprised that it did not seem very scholarly but very opinionated with no references and no bibliography.  However some of his views were on point and others were way off base. For instance, it was disappointing that he disagreed with the Afrocentrists, but at the same time used some of their ideas in other parts of the book to make his opinionated point. Anyhow a good read for beginners.	2005-02-21

Tillilating bits of history that are topped off in an eye opening and concise explanation of African Cosmology which was a direct source of the present day faiths that we know of today. The author has great charts with the similarities of the crucified saints worldwide. In addition, the author explains the origins of tribal histories and people in China, Europe, India, The Americas etc. as they relate to only one source.  The book is a wealth of information on other little known topics which makes it a excellent reference book as the author has impeccable sources of his/her assertions which makes the information difficult if not impossible to impeach. It was worth every penny paid.  This ain't for the average Sunday school class group nor the Conservatively educated.	2005-02-21

Afterwards, I realized that it might be too much to ask for good writing and analysis skills.  Death of the West provides no scientific basis for the authors assertions, some of which are absurd.  For example how many of us would agree that birth control, the sixties, integration, lack of certain history courses, immigration,  etc. has lead to the downfall(death) of the west? Ok even if the author believes that this is true why not show proof! Instead the author has resorted to the same conservative drive-time dribble we all suffer thru when trying to get thru the day. Don't waste you time on this one, not worth it.	2005-02-21

Bill O'reilly, Ann Coulter and all others were made to look like amateurs in an arena they clearly should not be in.  And though the author did explore some serious and disturbing environmental issues, his comedic diatribes usings republicans and others as whipping boys was the main subject.

The result is an informative and detailed look at history that most may be surprised to read.  Jennings analysis of the events is told in a story-like form, so that the reader is enlightened, then slowly taken in by the intrigue and intriging mischief of the day.  Another title for this research could have been {the art of puritan warfare}.  The author tells of the barbaric, imperialistic, and destructive engagements with the Irish as a prelude to the western invasion.  This invasive group of people had plenty of practice. Word of advice, read slowly, don't miss anything...Fantastic Work...	2004-10-01

I don't usually read fiction, but once I started I could not put it down.

How does a group go from SuperMen Mastering their Universe to men, few of which have mastered anything of their great past in less than 2000 years?  The author documents approximately 7000 years of little known historical fact that is destined to be the vital force resurrecting a visionary past.  This fantastic history has major giants of their time...(Moshesh, Chaka, Candace), advanced civilizations...(Bakuba, Mossi, Monomotapa), unprecedented intellectual learning centers...(Ghana, Timbuctu, Kem)...major cities as advanced as any known today...(Nowe, Thebes, Kano)...and the best part is the example of the classic constitutional government located at the end of the book.         This book deserves to be read by every student before high school graduation as a very basic intro to African World History and Culture. I was astounded by the abundance of information that proves the intellectual bases for high African civilizations.  This is also an excellent reference book and it is excellent reading!!!	2003-10-30

Additionally the author traces the various biblical names back to individual African Tribal Oriigins.    The author painstakingly showed other schools of thought not widely acknowledged and or known.

The book happened to be well documented, well written and well thought out.  I enjoyed it from an historical point of view, and wished that I had read it in high school.
