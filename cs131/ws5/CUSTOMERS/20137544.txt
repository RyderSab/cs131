Chris Raschka has to be one of my favorite illustrators. Charlie Parker Played Be Bop, Yo! Yes?, a Caldecott Honoree, and Arlene Sardine are some of my favorite picture books of all time.  But when I picked up John Coltrane's Giant Steps, things changed.  Yes, Giant Steps is creative.  Yes, it's gutsy.  But on paper, 'Steps' falls flat on it's artsy face.      The first pages of Giant Steps introduce us to 'a box, a snowflake, some raindrops, and a kitten', our performers.  We are then told (while the 'performers are limbering up') about the Giant Steps' composer, a man by the name of John Coltrane.  Afterwards the box, the snowflake, the raindrops, and the kitten begin their strange dance, blending their differing colors in 'harmony'.  The performers carry on with their dance, by now leaving the young readers either confused or annoyed.  Then the dance suddenly stops, and the narrorator corrects our dancers on their various mistakes.  And then the dance begins again!  *Sighs*      I'm gonna take a stab in the dark and say that ninety-nine percent of children will not enjoy this book.  The one percent (if that many) that will, have already heard of John Coltrane and his Giant Steps.  The other ninety-nine, like I said before, will probably hate it, like I, myself did.  Even Chris Raschka's paintings do little to distract the viewer from this terrible book!  I'll admit that Giant Steps had a beautiful and creative premise, but it sadly falls into the cliche of 'Just because it sounds good, doesn't mean it'll look good on paper!'

The book was The Funny Thing (a first library edition, too), one that I'd heard of, and even more important, one by Wanda Gag.  For those of you who don't know, Wanda Gag is perhaps the best picture book author/illustrator of the 20's and 30's.  Ms. Gag was the recipient of two Newbery Honor awards (for writting) and two Caldecott Honor awards (for her beautifully-detailed pen-and-ink drawings).  And though Ms. Gag wrote only a handful of books, her illustrations were some of the first in picture book history to be recognized as 'real' art.  That's what makes each of them special. <br /> <br />Now onto the review.  Within the first page of the story, we are introduced to Bobo, a baby-faced man who lives in a cave on top of the mountains all by his lonesome.  Well, except for the animals, which Bobo takes time out to feed every day.  He even has a stand where animals can feast on an assortment of dainties including, \\"nut cakes for the fuzzy-tailed squirrels\\" and \\"seed puddings for the pretty fluttering birds\\".  Everything goes well for Bobo until on a beautiful day, he encounters an animal that looks like a cross between a dog and a dragon.  This 'funny thing', as he calls it, talks, insisting that it is an aMinal, rather than an animal.  The funny thing then asks what Bobo has for him to eat.  After showing the funny thing all the different types of food he has to offer, and the funny thing rejecting each food, Bobo learns of what The Funny Thing loves to eat.  Dolls.  Yes, dolls.  Bobo is terribly upset that The Funny Thing eats dolls, thinking of all the small children left doll-less by the aminals appetite.  So Bobo decides to combine all the foods he has to make something The Funny Thing might actually like.  And it works.  But there's one problem: The Funny Things tails keeps growing longer and nothing can seem to stop it. <br /> <br />Wanda Gags creativity cannot be matched, and her books are some of the few that are just as good as they were the day they were published.  The text in the story, as you may have noticed are hand-lettered.  And, like always, the pictures are amazing.  I'm tellin' you guys, Wanda Gag's work is some of the best out there.   <br /> <br />R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer	2005-07-16

It was during a trip to my local bookstore that I first encountered this literary waste pile.  Romano, along with two other hardly mentioned brothers, recount a fictitious and very 'mild' trip to a theme park.  The trio's day goes along quite predictably, with the brothers anticipating the trip, naturally and, upon getting to the park, having to ride annoyingly named 'kiddie rides' with the youngest of the three.  C'mon people, 'Chuckie the Choo-Choo'?   <br /> <br />The rest of the day, chock-full of wedgies, noogies, and farts, goes on with Ray, called Raymie (pl-ease!), and the other one, Dickie, maybe?, finally going on 'The Vomitizer'.  So much for a climax, eh?   <br /> <br />Finally the family goes home and...I forgot the rest.  But I'm telling you, this book is terrible.  No joke.  Lacking even a mild plotline, among other thing, the title doesn't even make sense.  Raymie, Dickie, and the Bean: Why I Love and Hate My Brothers.  If Ray is the narrator, then why does he refer to himself as Raymie and not simply 'Me' or 'I'.  Oh wait, I know; because then his name wouldn't be first.   <br /> <br />Oh, and the illustrations; why is it that every book written by a comedian, or in Jason Alexander's case, a guy in a funny show, seem to have the same illustrations.  Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno, the aforementioned Jason Alexander.  All feature the same caricature-like illustrations in their books.

Well, I know that I am.  I read these reviews, obviously written by children and find myself so extremely disgusted that I almost gag.  Okay, maybe I don't gag, but... <br /> <br />  For example the review that stated, word-for-word, \\"This book had a very thin plot. You pretty much always knew what was going to happen next. Some people may like this book, and others may not. I didn't like this book.\\"  You can tell the reviewer is under the age of ten, perhaps seven.  And for the 'thin plot' argument, did you actually read 'Annie'.  The writting was so beautiful, the plot layered, the almost-unrecognized symbolism (from the text: \\"The sun rose, but it also set.  The cactus did not bloom forever.  Petels dried and fell to the earth\\")--what's not to like!   <br /> <br />  Now, for the second grade class.  Uhhh, have you guys ever thought that maybe this book wasn't intended for you.  I read this book as a thirteen year old, a year ago, and recently reread it.  I too, thought the story was mediocre at best and pondered on why it won a Newbery Honor.  Now at a mature fourteen, I ponder no more.  As I stated above, the book may not be for someone under thirteen.  But once you hit the big 1-3, go out and buy Annie and the Old One.  It won't dissapoint. <br /> <br />  Oh, and note the beautiful illustrations by Caldecott Honoree Peter Parnall. <br /> <br />  R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer.   <br />	2005-06-05

I was really dreading, to tell you the truth, reading Shattered Mirror all over again, and thought it to be the young authors worst offering yet.  I remember being disgusted since it basically had the exact same ending as Demon in My View.  But now I understand that their are really only two kinds of endings for the novellas Miss Rhodes writes.   <br /> <br />1)  Our protagonist-always a mysterious beauty- ends up giving into her feelings for the vampiric love interest, or has to because of impending death, and, so, becomes one of the undead.  Or <br /> <br />2) Doesn't become a vamp.  Simple as that. <br /> <br />The writting in 'Mirror' is the best out of the authors previous two, although not perfect by far.  She writes unrealistic fight-scene dialoge and that can really gets on my nerves.  We know she has an advanced vocabulary, so it really makes me wonder why she has to use prose-worthy speeches and dry wit within such chapters that deal with fights.  It's so annoying! <br /> <br />Okay, only one more.  AAR never fails to get under my skin, when describing her characters.  They're always mysterious, dark, and beautiful in a goth, black-out sort of way.  Aren't there any fat and ugly or just plain average-looking vampires?  Or even humans for that matter? <br /> <br />But all in all, the book was good.  The characters were intersting, especially the Ravaena siblings, and I hope AAR writes more about them in the future. <br /> <br />R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer.	2005-05-26

I would have given you a flat-out No.  But Aiborn seems to be different.  Its unfolds as a Jules Verne novel, yes, (as many reviewers have said already) but seems to run by a different, and fresh, formula.  The writing is some of the best I've seen in a teen book.  Well-deserving of its' Printz award.  <br /> <br />  Matt Cruse plays the meager role of cabin boy around the AURORA, a futuristic half blimp/half cruise ship.  But he doesn't mind.  He has found a home in the ship and feels isolated on land.  In short, life is good.  That is until he saves an elderly man from his sinking hot-air balloon.  Mystery enters around this point, when the old man asks Matt whether or not he has seen \\"them\\".  Matt, believing the man to be delirious, agrees that he has.  He reasons the man has seen an illusion, similar to the legend of the mermaid.  The old man is boarded on The Aurora, but dies later on, leaving Matt curious about \\"them\\". <br /> <br />  Skip forward, one year later.  Matt is still cabin boy, but expects to be promoted to sailmaker soon.  A new trip is just around the corner and Matt is excited to be in the air again.  But, then, the sailmaking postion is filled by the son of Otto Lunardi's (the owner of the Aurora) son.  Matt, as you can imagine, is devastating, but stays on the ship, still thinking of it as his home.  But these events will soon be forgotten, when Matt meets the charming, rich, and beatiful Kate de Vries (accompanied by an escort, of course).  Ms, de Vries, as Matt insists on calling her, revives the mystery of the old man and the creatures he saw and takes him on a ride more exciting than any he's had on the Aurora. <br /> <br /> <br />  Kenneth Oppel, known for is \\"soaringly\\" successful Silverwing Trilogy, has crafted yet another well-written novel about an unlikely hero.  Airborn may seem to be slow during the first chapter, but I dare you to read on.  You won't regret it. <br /> <br />  R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer	2005-05-05

It tells of the adventures (and a few misadventures) of our hero in his native, Green Woods, where the language is a bit...different.  Take Runny Babbit, for instance.  We all know that it's suppose to be Bunny Rabbit, but thats a bit cliche.  So Runny Babbit, not to mention his friends, Ploppy Sig, Rirty Dat, Calley At, and so on are perfect for this book.  Even normal words are toyed with, and I'll admit that this can be confusing, and sometimes a little frustrating.  But I got used to it after about the tenth page and found that the rest of the book was pretty darn good.    <br /> <br />The poems are vintage Silverstein, in the manner of being silly, and are perfect for his final book.  Runny Babbit is a fun book for all types of children, especially budding poets.  I might even go so far to mention that it rivals Silversein's other classics (see, A Light in the Attic, Falling Up, The Giving Tree, and others).  Oh, and the illustrations are Shel Silverstein at his very best. <br /> <br />R, reviewer from the 'hood.	2005-04-17

After a slow start, I finally got into reading Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key, the first in a series of acclaimed and award-winning books (winning both a Newbery Honor and National Book Award Finalist seal).  Joey's misadventures ARE funny, but the recommended age of 10-up seems wrong somehow (hence the part when Joey accidentally cuts the tip of a fellow classmates nose off).  The summary is simple: The trials of a young boy handling his ADD the best way he can, and with a touches of humor along the way.  Simply put for a book that is anything but.<br /><br />Jack Gantos, author of the wonderful Hole in My Life, does well with the the first Joey book.

At first, upon hearing about this book and what it was about, I thought it would be a nice little story about animals in heaven,(I'd never heard of Sylvia Browne before, being a teen)ut I was wrong.  This woman actually thinks people will believe she can see heaven through the eyes of animals.  C'mon, even children aren't that gullible!    If you do happen the buy Animals on the Other Side, I would recommend warning your children that this is only a story and may or may not be true.  It could still be comforting and yet the child would know this book doesn't exactly speak a truth about their pet.      I'll hand it to the author(my mom's a fan).

In the Small, Small Pond is about a pond (of course) and how the animals surrounding it react during the changing seasons. The one-line rhymes may be a little boring, but, again, the illustrations make up for that. Yes, \\"The Pond\\" may not be best for toddlers, but children old enough WILL appreciate it's content. Denise Fleming is a master at her work. Her books have went on to be some of my favorites and I hope to see more of them in the future.

Tension rears it's ugly head when Crepsley discovers the vampaneze have made a station in his hometown. Dum-dum-dummm!  Will Darren and Mr. Crepsley set out to retrieve the vamps beloved home?<br /><br />  Author Shan's writting has improved along with his dialoge(see the first book).  The prologues and interuptions with the story to describe an already know character or place is uneccesary.  I don't know anyone who would begin a twelve-book series at the seventh book.<br /><br />  R	2004-12-23

I'm just a little confused. <br /> <br />  Xandra Hobbs is kind but-to speak truthfully- untalented.  Each of her family members have talent, yet she is left out.  Her only purpose, it seems, is to help injured animals as she does in the beginning chapter.  When she is finished nursing an egret back to normal health, she finds one of it's feathers, which she believes is enchanted.  She becomes interested in a classmate who believes in the supernatural and views the world of the Unseen. <br /> <br />  Snyder's work is enjoyable as always and The Unseen is destined to follow in the steps of The Egypt Game and her other classics. <br /> <br />  R	2004-12-23

Dav's teachers grew tired of Dav's \\"books\\" and told him that he couldn't make comics all his life.  Let's just say Dav wasn't interested in his teacher's remarks.<br /><br />Two boys named George and Harold are the creators of the Captain Underpants comic that they sell for 50 cents at the playgrounds at school.  Not too bad, huh?  Their principal loathes the two, who are known to be tricksters.  Their smiles and playful demeanor irks the pants of him, not literally.  But the pricipal soon finds some dirt on the boys that is footage of them causing mayhem at a major football game.  The principal, named Mr. Krupp, threatens to show the tape to the football players-big, scary players, I would imagine-if the boys don't follow a strict set of rules that forbids them to act up in class, among others.  The boys must get that tape.  And they do with the help of a mail-order ring that has the ability to hypnotize it's victim.  After getting the tape, Harold and George decide to have some more fun with the ring and their principal.

Risika, as you may know from other reviews, is a 300-year old vamp that lives in a New England town.  Even since Risika, or Rachel(her birth name) was \\"changed\\", she has hated another vampire, named Aubrey, for killing her brother.  Though we don't really find out very much about Risika's character, except through her relationships with others(her family, Aubrey, the tiger, etc., this book is still highly entertaining. <br /> <br />  Yes, you hear the reviewers who say,\\"She copied Anne Rice\\" or \\"Her writting is primative\\", but really who cares whether or not a book is well-written.(As for the Anne Rice comments, I wouldn't know because I haven't read her work).  What Atwater-Rhodes has done is create a work that not only inspires a younger generation of writers, but she actually creates an enjoyable read.  I would much rather read something good that a tiresome, well-written novel. <br /> <br />But-as in every book-there are some things that got on my nerves.  For example the countless amount of times she used the word aura, and how Risika's relationship with the tiger wasn't explored as it should have been.  The book was just to short.

The Introduction in this book is narrated by a boy named Darren Shan(yes, the name of the author).  He claims that everything in this story is true, and strangely brings up how much he liked spiders as a child.  But youll find out why soon enough...<br /><br />  Darren is a regular kid.  He and a boy named Steve are best friends and Steve is also just about as normal as they come-well, that is, if you think those who beleive in the supernatural(vampires, etc...)are normal.  But their lives will change soon, when they find an odd flyer.  The flyer advertises a Freak Show named Cirque du Freak(Circus of Freaks in French).  They along with two other good friends decide they have to go.  But there is a problem, well many problems and one of them is cost.  The \\"show\\" is very expensive.  One of the friends just take some money out of a saving jar. Problem one: Solved<br /><br />  Another problem, our heroes will find out, is that only two people can get in with one flyer.  In the end Steve and Darren get the tickets. Problem Two: Solved.<br /><br />When Steve and Darren get to the fair, they view many strange, yet entertaining acts.  One man, who owns an amazing spider, catches Steves eye.  The reader will later find out that Steve recognized the man as a vamp from one of his books about the supernatural.  But Darren is more interested in the spider.<br /><br />  After the show Steve confronts the vampire and begs for the eternal life vamps supposedly have.  Well in Darren Shan-land vamps live only many years after the average human, not forever.  But little does Steve know, that Darren is watching.  This disgusts Darren and he runs home.<br /><br />  Darren is still facsinated by the spider the day after.  He dicides to steal it.  And thats just what he does.  he even figures out how to control it.  And then things take a turn for the worse.<br /><br />  The writting level disappointed me at first but then I realized that the wider audience this book has, the better.	2004-10-08

Because your child won't read it and <br />2.This book doesn't teach anything we havent already heard. <br /> <br />  This book reads like a corny tv special that annoys very bored Americans.  Mr. O'Reilly's writtings could relate to a child, but only because of the low reading level.   <br /> <br />  Since I know that Bill meant well with the book, I will provide two stars, but perhaps thats saying too much.  His attemp at using \\"slang\\" was disgusting along with the way he tried to make kids think he could relate to them(even if he can in some issues).  He has vitually no experience in divore or ridicule, as many other CURRENT teens across the nation has, and shouldn't have bothered with this book anyway.  Maybe a REAL teen should have wrote the book?  But why a 50+ man grappling for new fans.  Again, don't buy this one its a waste of money and time. <br />   <br />  Ill admit it, I got tricked into buying this book.	2004-10-03

Violet and Klaus are rolling down the Mortmain(I believe) Mountains and trying to come up with a way to stop.  The famed ribbon has been in the picture for quiet a while so Violet is already thinking up some kind of strange and creative invention.  They decide to use some very sticky substances from the trailor they are in.  Since most of you know about the sequel it is safe to say that the \\"invention\\" worked. <br /> <br />  Sunny, as I said before, is with Olaf and his troupe.  She has to do everything for the lazy bunch including cooking with very sparse materials.  But Sunny manages with her cooking talents and newfound maturity(our little Sunny can even speak almost as a normal person would!).  But still Sunny is very far from appreciated.   <br /> <br />The Baudelaires have to find a way to rescue Sunny and in the process meet someone who should have died in a fire and an old classmate at the \\"austere\\" academy.

Violet, with her thinking ribbon and Klaus and Sunny with their creative minds put together this unstopable force.  Bring it on Olaf!! <br /> <br />  The Baudelaire orphans are once again in a new home with a relative even as strange as the last two( I said strange, not evil).  Aunt Josephine.  The name gives me shivers.  But not because of the way she treated our poor antagonists, but because of the warmthless time they spent with her on her house near the lake.  The orphans gaurdian also fears many things. For example, anything electrical or the lake, which is home to the Lachrymose leeches that killed her husband.  Since Josephine is scared of anything she only makes a boring pea soup for food.  As you may have guessed, Count Olaf has to come into the story sometime.

His discovery is ragtime.  The ragtime music isn't boring and repetitve as the type of music he had practiced as a boy.  This music gives of a rythmical sensation throughout the body.  Duke is soon in love with the piano.  And he starts practicing with the little knowledge of the piano he has.

When reading this book you will be offered five bucks, a game of drive the bus, and you will be told that your mother would let the pigeon drive.<br /><br />  I have a suggestion Mr. Willems:  In your next book, LET THE PiGEON DRIVE THE BUS!!!(He-he-he)	2004-08-24

WARNING!!This review may contain Spoilers! <br /> <br />  This story starts out by telling about the birth of a young girl who is amazingly big for her age.  No one knows that she will become a great woodswoman since she cannot climb a tree at birth without help:).  As she grows older she saves her town numerous times with her strength earning her the name \\"Swamp Angel\\". <br /> <br />  When a mean bear comes to town many hunters try to capture it before it causes anymore damage.(One is Swamp Angel) Eventually she does capture the bear, named Tarnation, and kills him.  Call me a sucker for a happy,happy ending, but I was hoping Tarnation would give up his evil ways and use his strength for good.  And then they could have all lived...well you know what I mean.	2004-08-23

The couple is very lonely and is seeking some animal companionship.  'If only we had a cat', the woman suggests.  So the old man goes of in search of the perfect cat(funny how picture book characters act sometimes, huh).  When he finds a hill that is \\"quiet covered\\" with cats he finds the cat he is in search of-except then he finds another cat, and another, and a few that couldn't be left behind.  Soon all the cats are following him home.  When he returns to his wife she is surprised and reminds him about the cost of feeding all these cats and they decide on a solution: the cats themselves should decide which of them is the best.  You can guess what happens from here.  All of the cats claim that they are the best and get into a huge fight. The result is all of the cats getting eaten up by each other.  One kitten remains and tells that since he is not an attractive cat he didn't argue with any of the others and wasn't eaten.  The couple, of course raises this cat who becomes better than the millions of cats that they once had to choose from. <br /> <br />  Gag's black and white illustrations are the best feature of this book and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.	2004-08-23

The dreams tells him to go to a far of land to find a great treasure. <br />So he does search far away until he finds the exact spot his dream mentions.  But theres a problem: the place is guarded.

It's written by my favorite author of the genre, Russell Freedman. (Lincoln: A Photobiography)<BR>  <BR>  The only thing that made the book a little less enjoyable was the lack of information about the childhood of Orville and Wilbur. Also, I found myself asking questions about The Wright's parents and and siblings, who were weakly potrayed in the book Every other bit of information was intact, and the affect was this great book.	2004-07-11

As time goes on, Jessica believes that the cat is possesing her into doing mean things (ex.Washing her her mother's dry-clean dress.)  She also thinks that the cat is being possesed by a group of witches, hence the name.

From the other reviews I'm gonna bet that the whole book is like that.<BR>Just because the little girl was 10 doesn't mean that she could publish a book.  There are tons of better child authors out there.  Thanks for ruining their reputations as good, respected authors.

Susie Salmon is just fourteen when she is raped and murdered by a neighborhood man. The books tell about the events that take place after Susie's death with her family, and about her life in &quot;her&quot; heaven.  This novel doesn't forget about our antagonist, though, who is dies in a realistic way. Sebold deosn't want to please the audience, in my opinion. She just wants the story to go along withought seeming fake. The Lovely Bones doesn't try to make you feel sorry for Susie, it just wants the reader to have a deeper understanding about rape. Remember people, this is literature, not a soap. I, personally, don't understand the mediocre reviews. This book is superb!	2004-07-09

If some people think this is a story that relates to the author's rascism, then that is their small-minded problem.<BR>  <BR>  If you like 'Sambo', then you'll like Why the Sun and the Moon Live in the Sky.
