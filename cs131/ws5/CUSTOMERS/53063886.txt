US tank casualties in Europe in WWII were appallingly high.<br />2. The M4 Sherman tank (and US tank destroyers) had a difficult time fighting the  German Panther and Tiger tanks.<br />3. Development of the M26 Pershing, a tank with more armor and firepower than the M4 Sherman, was delayed by objections from Army Ground Forces (AGF).<br /><br />Cooper unfortunately mashes these three truths together into a single simplistic and hyperbolic scenario that goes something like this: \\"Tank losses were extremely high because our tanks were vastly inferior to German tanks.  The war in Europe would have ended much sooner had the M26 Pershing been available in large quantities, but the M26 was delayed because of the arrogance of a few US Generals, Patton being the chief culprit.\\"<br /><br />Patton did not make this decision.  Objections to the M26 came because the AGF had fixed upon the doctrine of using the lightly armored and open-turreted tank destroyers for the task of taking on enemy tanks.  Most historians blame Lt. Gen. Leslie McNair, the head of AGF, for this unfortunate decision.  There were many reasons for this decision, too many to discuss in this review, but Cooper does not even mention the existence of the tank destroyer doctrine in this book.<br /><br />The decision to make the M4 Sherman the main tank of the US Army did not come out of a false sense of arrogance, as Cooper claims.  All three of the major tank armies made similar decisions to continue production for the duration of the war those tanks that had so far proven themselves in combat  - these were the German Pzkfw IV, the Russian T34, and the US M4 Sherman.  These were proven designs that already had a manufacturing and support base.  All three tanks were upgraded and would stay roughly equivalent in capability.  Cooper fails to mention almost all of the upgrades to the Sherman (e.g.,  \\"wet storage\\" and the 76mm HVAPC round), which made it both more survivable and lethal as the war progressed.<br /><br />The big difference was that, unlike the US, the German Army was convinced of the need for tank supremacy, and Hitler took a personal interest in ensuring that this would occur.  And so at huge cost, the Tiger and Panther tanks were also built (the Tiger I was eight times more expensive than the Pzkfw IV).<br /><br />Tank casualties in all of the armies of Europe in WWII were high.  A key bit of insight missing from this book is the fact that tanks, originally conceived as breakthrough weapons against static defenses, had by 1944 become highly vulnerable when attacking well defended positions alone, without artillery or air support.  Anti-tank weapons had advanced tremendously, and any tank could be destroyed if adequately targeted - it was also thus not necessary to have tank supremacy to destroy superior tanks.<br /><br />So, the enormous labor and expense that Germany went through to ensure tank supremacy with the Tiger and Panther tanks would prove to have only limited tactical value - tanks could not win the war by themselves.  The US and Britain went for air supremacy instead, and were the only countries to utilize strategic bombers in WWII, which did eventually win the war.  Because ultimately, the single most important factor that hastened the defeat of Germany was Allied bombing of Germany's synthetic fuel plants between May and September 1944  (Albert Speer himself said so).  From that point on,  Germany's ability to field a modern mechanized army declined rapidly.  By January 1945, the German Army was out of fuel for its tanks.  Both at the Battle of the Bulge on the Western Front, and at the Vistula River on the Eastern Front, the \\"vastly superior\\" German tanks would be overrun or abandoned, out of fuel.<br /><br />And so, contrary to Cooper's thesis, if anything could have ended the war earlier, it would have been an earlier targeting of these synthetic fuel plants, not the mere introduction of a better tank like the M26.  Twice as expensive as an M10, the M26 was not invincible, nor was it superior to the Panther and Tiger tanks.<br /><br />There are many other books that give a more accurate history of tank warfare in WWII.  \\"Sledgehammers\\" by Christopher Wilbeck is one of the best books at demythologizing the Tiger tank.  Thomas Jentz's books on the Panther and Tiger tanks also give a good picture of the mechanical difficulties of these tanks (among other things, they leaked gasoline and so burned easily).  Jentz's Panther book has the results of ballistic tests done by the Germans which show that the Sherman was not as helpless, and the Panther not as invincible as Cooper's book might lead you to believe.  George Forty's \\"United States Tanks of World War II\\" and Steven Zaloga's many books on the M4, M26, and the tank destroyers give a much better account of the controversy surrounding the development of these AFVs. \\"Armored Thunderbolt\\" is probably the best overall book by Zaloga which gives the real history of the development of the M4, and debunks much of the mythology created by Cooper in \\"Deathtraps\\".  Dmitriy Loza's \\"Commanding the Red Army's Sherman Tanks\\" gives a  wholly positive assessment of the M4 relative to the T34.  \\"Steel Victory\\" by Harry Yeide is a collection of combat tales of the M4 Sherman tank, demonstrating its importance in the rapid Allied advance.  \\"German AFV's of World War II\\"  and \\"American AFV's of World War II\\" by  Duncan Crow, although long out of print, both have excellent details about  these tanks, including some cost figures.Both at the Battle of the Bulge on the Western Front, and at the Vistula River on the Eastern Front, the \\"vastly superior\\" German tanks would be overrun or abandoned, out of fuel.

This book has been a pustule on our rear for so long. I will never write a third edition - you can bet the estate on it. So yes, David, you can be the first author of the third edition. ....\\"<br /><br />So begins the introduction by Robert Grossman to this second edition of \\"Neuroradiology: The Requisites\\".<br /><br />It is a bit strange to see so many bad jokes and bad poems and such blunt Asperger syndrome-type language in what should be a dry and scholarly textbook for serious professionals, but at least the book is never boring. RIG and DMY manage to skewer surgeons, lawyers, HMOs, FMGs, other radiologists, their wives, each other, and most of all, Bill and Hilary Clinton, while educating us all about the essence of Neuroradiology. Strangely enough, the words \\"George Bush\\" are completely absent from this book - one wonders because the authors work hard to be equal opportunity jokesters, and DMY states in the book that he is a liberal Democrat. But then, remember that this book was finished right around the time that the War in Iraq Part Deux was getting started, a time when people were getting death threats just for even wondering out loud - \\"Gee what if Saddam doesn't have any WMDs?\\" I do get a distinct feeling that both these guys were probably in favor of regime change in Iraq in any case.<br /><br />(For all you young, liberal Democrat, whippersnapper Radiology residents out there, basking in your multiple job offers, let me explain that Bill and Hilary will forever live in a very hot and dark place in the memories of older Radiologists for creating the last big Down cycle in our field, the Great Job Depression of 1994-1998. In one of his first major policy speeches on health care reform, Bill Clinton singled out the MRI scanner as a prime example of how expensive and wasteful healthcare in the US had become. Subsequently, the volume of MRI scans nationwide shot downward, MR centers closed right and left, and radiology jobs disappeared. In the fall of 1995, there were only four full time radiology job openings in the entire state of California advertised in the ACR Professional Bureau.............Never Forget! Never Forgive!)<br /><br />This book is more than enough for the Radiology resident studying to take the Radiology Boards. That's what it was designed for.  It is also a great book for the old farts in private practice to review and get updated on the latest stuff.<br /><br />Being an old fart in private practice, I read this book to study for the Maintenance of Certificate (MOC) exam for the Neuroradiology CAQ. I passed, but I'm pretty sure they graded on a curve, because that was one heck of a hard test, way harder than the original Neuro CAQ. Good thing I also scanned through Ann Osborne's \\"Diagnostic Imaging: Brain\\"; plus I paged through Som and Curtin's two volume \\"Head and Neck Imaging\\" book on CD. Both texts were also useful for the MOC.<br /><br />Ah, what the heck, they probably passed everybody .......don't let me scare you, go ahead and take the MOC....<br /><br />The only criticism that I have for this book is that a few of the illustrations are just awful, really poor transfers from the original. The authors do acknowledge this problem in the introduction. Plus, for some interesting entities there are no images, whereas for some relatively common things (at least in private practice, possibly these are extremely rare in academia?) like synovial cysts of the lumbar spine, there are, what, some FIFTEEN images?!

The title is a bit misleading, since this book is mainly a  history of the B-29 during WWII, including its development, mechanical workings, early flights, and of course, its bombing missions over Japan.<br /><br />The book is a terrific photo essay, and has really great photos of the innards of the B-29, as well as shots of the B-29 bases in China and then at Guam, pictures from the bombing missions, pictures of the Japanese fighter pilot opposition, etc.  Almost every aspect of the history of the B-29 is covered, including a photo of the crash site where Boeing test pilot Edmund Allen was killed.  I had read elsewheres already that the prototype B-29 had plowed into a meat packing plant - the photo in this book shows pigs that were let loose by the crash standing on the roof of the partially collapsed building!<br /><br />There are just so many photos like that one that are intensely unique and eye-catching;  the book just sweeps you back into time, back when the B-29 was first struggling to get going, and then progressing to where it became the most devastating deliverer of death and destruction of WWII.	2005-02-12

There are only a few descriptions of individual tank to tank combat, which is probably the only weakness of this book.  Wilbeck instead concentrates on painting an overall picture of the effectiveness of the Tiger tanks in combat.  In the end, Wilbeck concludes that despite their fearsome reputation, born out of many anecdotal tales of awesome lethality, the Tiger tanks were severely limited in what they could accomplish on a strategic level.<br /><br />In tank to tank combat, the Tigers were incredibly good at killing other tanks, reaching kill ratios up to 13:1 in many cases.  But, as Wilbeck points out in great detail, the end result of designing a tank with very heavy armor and extreme firepower was a tank that was very heavy and extremely expensive and time consuming to manufacture (Hitler personally ordered the specifications for the Tiger tank).  The Tigers were very prone to breaking down (mostly because of their weight, which strained the entire mechanical system), could not cross most of the bridges in Europe, and had to be shipped by train to the battlefield (they would break down if they had to be driven for any great distance).  There were only a few Tigers ever manufactured (1,348 Tiger Is and less than 500 Tiger IIs ), and even fewer that actually showed up on the battlefield.  They guzzled gasoline, were extremely slow (with an average speed of about 4-9 miles per hour on rough terrain or dirt roads  - well below the stated maximum design speed of 25 mph), and had an extremely short combat radius and duration.  The high kill ratios when they did engage in combat were offset by their tendency to either run out of gas or break down in combat, which resulted in large numbers having to be abandoned (more than were destroyed by Allied tanks).  Also, U.S. and British forces had superior mobility due to widespread mechanization, as well as superior artillery and airpower.  Because of the immobility and limited numbers of the Tiger tanks, it was possible to avoid confronting them with tanks, and instead, Allied forces would try to bypass and isolate them, or destroy them with heavy artillery or airpower.<br /><br />There were other major weaknesses - for instance, the German Army was the only one of the major armies in Europe to not have minesweeping tanks.  Inexplicably, the Germans persisted in using these precious few Tiger tanks to \\"bull-through\\" minefields, a tactic that led to long trails of busted Tiger tanks whenever a unit encountered a minefield, leaving few to carry out the attack at the other end of the minefield.  The Germans also suffered from a lack of sufficient retrieval vehicles that could handle the heavy Tigers.  This led to the abandonment of many Tigers that could have been repaired had they been retrieved.<br /><br />Wilbeck gives the statistic that each Tiger I tank cost 800,000 Reichmarks, which was equivalent to the weekly wages of 30,000 people, and required 300,000 man-hours to produce.  [Note bene:  at those rates, the Tigers were very much high end super-weapons, equivalent on a cost basis to something like the U.S. B-29, which cost about a million dollars apiece, or a Navy destroyer].<br /><br />There is an interesting analysis in this book of Tiger ace Michael Wittmann's famous attack at Bocage-Villers.  Wilbeck points out that although the battle did temporarily halt the British advance and take an appalling toll on their tanks, by the end of the day, Wittmann's entire unit had been knocked out and was combat ineffective whereas the British tanks were quickly replaced.  Continuing the story, Wilbeck describes how Wittman was later killed in another attack on the Caen-Falaise road in which he unknowingly charged into battle against some 900 Allied tanks with only some 50 on his side (only 8 of which were Tiger tanks).  Wittmann'sTiger was most likely flanked by a  Sherman Firefly which fired the fatal round.<br /><br />Ultimately, as can be seen in the demise of Michael Wittman, numbers were what won tank battles in WWII.  By 1944, the technology for destroying tanks had far outstripped the ability to make armor protection.  Tank losses were very high on all sides as a result.<br /><br />The German Army understood the value of powerful tanks, but never took to heart the even greater importance of producing large numbers of tanks.  This is what made the Tiger tank a failure - the fact that such an enormous amount of German resources went into producing so few tanks that could be so easily disabled or bypassed.tanks).

It is easy to read and has some additional historical background and commentary thrown in by the author to help understand some of Ugaki's thought processes.<br /><br />After reading this book, I went and found \\"Fading Victory\\"  in the library.  I am still trying to slug through that book - it's pretty dense going by comparison and makes me appreciate Hoyt's version much more.<br /><br />The only problem with condensed versions, of course, is that some of the details  get lost,  glossed over, or are over-generalized.  This is a generic problem with Hoyt's writings, I have found.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this book is a good read.  It really gives you a good sense of the thinking behind the intensely macho military culture run amok in Japan during WWII.<br /><br />The most important concept that I got out of this book was that this military culture was basically just like \\"Beavis and Butthead\\" in terms of their pathetic determination to engage in  high testosterone acts of male stupidity and aggression, safe in a complete ignorance of how well the intended victims might be able to fight back.  The parallels to this sort of teenage impulsiveness and short-sightedness continue with the (well-documented in this book) inability of the Japanese military to plan for the future or to anticipate potential pitfalls, after their inital success had faded.  The only result of all this was a lot of death and suffering for the ordinary soldiers and civilians of Japan.<br /><br />A good example was the Guadalcanal campaign -  the book describes in some detail how the Japanese Army first completely underestimated the capabilities of the American forces on Guadalcanal and repeatedly landed, piecemeal, undersized contingents of soldiers to drive off the Americans.  Then, when these soldiers failed in their initial assaults, it turned out that the Japanese Army had made almost no plans for supplying these soldiers long term so that they could re-group and continue to fight.  Large numbers of the Japanese soldiers starved to death or died of disease as a result.  An initially small and tenuous American foothold on Guadalcanal grew ever stronger until Japan had to admit defeat and withdraw from Guadalcanal, giving the US its first major victory over Japan in a land conflict.<br /><br />Ugaki was among the contingent of hotheads who had sought to start the war with the US.  After working with Admiral Yamamoto, (who was the only Japanese officer of any rank who had actually once lived in the US and so knew something about the country),  he came to undertand how foolish that decision was.  The level of American resources and economy was just far superior to Japan.<br /><br />Nevertheless, neither he nor the other militarists could bring themselves to admit that they had made a terrible mistake and give up the fight.  Lots of foolish pride!!!<br /><br />At the moment of Japan's surrender, Ugaki's final act of desperation, which was to get into the back seat of a bomber and try to crash it into an American ship or installation on Okinawa, also failed miserably.  His flight of last kamikazes was unceremoniously shot down by American night fighters on routine patrol.<br /><br />About all I can say is, good riddance.  A lot of people died in this world because of militarists like Ugaki.  Japan, and the whole world have benefited greatly from getting rid of them.

As such, his personal experience with the B-29 makes for somewhat of an interesting read.  But that's about it for this book.<br /><br />Morrison was put into a ground staff position, which meant that a) he didn't fly as many missions as other bombardiers and b) his operational flight career got stretched out for the duration of WWII.  This has pluses and minuses for the book - on the one hand, he has personal tales of flying missions on the B-29, and he was there for the entire duration of the B-29's operations in WWII, but on the other hand, he was on the ground watching others fly missions (and crash and burn) a lot.  It also meant that he was close enough to the higher level people like Curtis LeMay to know them on a staff level, but wasn't high ranking enough to be personally involved in the planning of combat operations.<br /><br />The biggest, most ANNOYING problem with this book is that the author re-counts a great deal of the history of the higher level planning involving the B-29's operations by re-creating these very long conversations between Curtis LeMay and others.  Now, in the preface, he says that these conversations really did occur and that he got this information from interviewing LeMay and other people.  I do believe that he did do these interviews, and these people did give him a lot of information, but I doubt that they actually could have remembered what they said verbatim like what is set down in this book.  These long conversations read like extensive stretches of exposition from a movie script.  A lot of what is said just doesn't sound like people talking in real-life.  It just reads like a very artificial way of setting down third-person information that could have been recounted better from a standard historian's perspective.<br /><br />Finally, there is surprisingly little technical information about the workings of the B-29 bomber itself in this book.  This is the biggest bummer of all about this book.  This book really isn't about the B-29 bomber.<br /><br />I have read a few other books about the B-29.  \\"Superfortress\\" by Curtis LeMay and Bill Yenne, has LeMay recounting in a much more realistic first-person style what his thoughts and actions were all about during the B-29 campaign, and is especially good at giving you a sense of how well LeMay managed the logistical difficulties of the B-29 bombing campaign.  It's a slim book, though, and the technical aspects of the bomber are glossed over and appear to have been filled in by Yenne (the switching off between LeMay's rough and tumble jargon, and Yenne's formal historian-speak is a bit jarring).  \\"Bombers over Japan\\" by Keith Wheeler, a Time-Life book, has an excellent mix of the technical workings of the B-29 as well as a solid account of its operational history.  There are lots of photos and drawings of the innards of the B-29.  \\"Saga of the Superfortress\\" by Steven Birdsall has a  thorough historical account of the B-29's operational history.<br /><br />Anyway, these other books are better, but are out of print, unfortunately.  LeMay's book gives a more direct insight into his thoughts and plans, and has some excellent explanations and justifications for his campaign of massive firebombing (the original reason, as it turns out, was not to crush the Japanese into submission, but because a combination of poor US intelligence, bad weather, lousy navigation, and technical problems with the B-29 all made early attempts at \\"precision bombing\\" of Japan completely hopeless.  The B-29 was able to successfully take out Japanese war factories or installations only by burning down entire cities.  Later on, as the deadline for the US invasion of Japan loomed, LeMay desperately wanted to  end the war with Japan before the invasion, to save US casualties,  and at that point he was all set to completely  annihilate all of Japan with firebombing if need be.  He would have, too, if the atomic bomb had not intervened).  The Wheeler book is really good for the technical stuff.  There are other excellent books as well, but so far these are the only ones that I've found on the B-29.  It seems like a lot of the best books are out of print. After being disappointed by buying this book, I'm mostly going to go to the library for other books like this one from now on.<br /><br />Reading all of these books, one really gets the sense that the B-29 was an experimental plane, and quite dangerous to its own aircrews.  The engines were just so unreliable that they could just quit at any time, or worse yet, set the plane on fire, which was why so many B-29's crashed and burned.  Japan really did not have any sort of a developed air defense system, like Germany did; otherwise the B-29's would have fared much more poorly.<br /><br />In summary, \\"Birds From Hell\\" turns out to be just another one of the many first-person histories of WWII experiences that are proliferating out there right now, as the Greatest Generation fades into memory.  It tries to be more than that, but doesn't really succeed.  And it is not a technical book about the B-29 bomber itself.f Japan with firebombing if need be.

Yes, definitely, this book has value for that purpose.<br /><br />Much of the book is a re-telling of the history of the Jews, stuff from the Old Testament/Tanakh, which Josephus knew well from his origins as a Pharisee.<br /><br />In my view, though, the book is most important for a reason only briefly mentioned by other reviewers - the book answers a central question that has always struck me  whenever I read about the modern history of the Jewish people and the re-establishment of the State of Israel - how did it come to pass that the Jews lost their homeland in Palestine in the first place?  Few modern Jewish historians ever go back that far and write about this subject.<br /><br />In this book, Flavius Josephus gives a detailed and grisly  eyewitness account of the destruction of Jerusalem and the slaughter of over 1.3 million Jews (he provides the number of dead in this book), and later enslavement of tens of thousands of the survivors, by the Romans in 70 A.D.  This all came about as a result of the unyielding Jewish rebellion against Roman rule.<br /><br />It was this destruction of Jerusalem, and the Great Temple, that directly led to the Jewish Diaspora.  (The Wailing Wall, or Western Wall, is all that's left today of the Temple).<br /><br />Which was what caused the Jews to be dispersed all over Europe.  Which eventually led to the Holocaust.  Which led to the Zionist movement (initially only a fringe movement with few converts willing to move back to Palestine) succeeding in finding the converts and refugees willing to return to the heartland of their faith.  The rapid flood of Jews into Palestine and the war that resulted from the re-establishment of the State of Israel all led to the displacement of the then current inhabitants, the Arab Palestinians.  Which of course brings us to where we are today.....<br /><br />Few Jews seem to care much for Josephus, and certainly he gives them good reason to be thought of as a traitor.  After all, he did start out as one of the leaders of the Jewish rebellion against the Romans, and ended up as a Roman collaborator in the destruction of Jerusalem.<br /><br />After initial success fighting against the Romans, Josephus became trapped in one of the rebelling towns.  When his fellow rebels could not be dissuaded to surrender, he proposed that they all commit suicide by drawing lots and having each man in sequence kill the one before him.  Josephus managed to be the last one in line, and then, being the last one alive, didn't follow through with his own suicide.<br /><br />After being captured by the forces of the Roman general Vespasian, Josephus then managed to save himself by making a prediction that Vespasian would become emperor.  I found it interesting that Vespasian, who was no fool, clearly thought that Josephus was just sucking up to him and did not release him right away.  Instead, Vespasian kept Josephus imprisoned until, miraculously, Josephus's prediction came true (after Nero's suicide and a civil war with a succession of three other Roman generals claiming the throne, Vespasian emerged victorious as the new emperor).<br /><br />No, Josephus was not a really admirable sort of fellow.  And as his account is one of the few that describes the destruction of Jerusalem (and of many other mass killings of Jews during this time, including the story of what happened at Masada), it is easy to see why Jews would not want to re-visit this part of their history.<br /><br />In his description of the siege of Jerusalem, there are plenty of details of the internecine hatred that existed between the Jews and the various other peoples of the Middle East, even back then.  A lot of these other people took advantage of this siege to get their revenge against the Jews stuckin Jerusalem.<br /><br />Yes, read this book, and you will come to understand that the origins of the Middle East conflict of today goes back some 2,000 years, back to the time that Jerusalam was destroyed and the Jewish people dispersed.  This book tells how all of that happened, and how it all started.that the origins of the Middle East conflict of today goes back some 2,000 years, back to the time that Jerusalam was destroyed and the Jewish people dispersed.

OK, now that I have this book, I'm not sure why I got it.  Maybe I should sell it since it seems to have gone out of print again and the used versions have skyrocketed in price!  My copy is still in mint condition (barely opened!).<br />The book is mainly composed of engineering draft quality line drawings of the various parts of the Yamato (some 159 pages), with breakdowns of virtually every external part of the ship conceivable (e.g., masts, gun turret machinery, steam pipe vents, tackle, etc.).  Nothing about the innards of the ship.<br />There's  8 pages of photographs, and sixteen pages of text describing the Yamato's history and construction.<br />A great book for model builders and Ultra-Enthusiasts of battleships!<br />Too bad I'm not one of those..... what the heck was I thinking anyways?.... it's just too easy to click and order from Amazon.com.	2004-02-13
US	53063886	R9QHQJ2CW1Y6P	0312909675	391800863	Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership	Books	4	10	13	N	N	Bushido means that you never learn from your mistakes	This book was a good read.  Not the best ever war story told, like some of the reviews would have you believe, but good enough to hold my attention for one entire night of reading.<br /><br />The main annoying part with this book was the fictionalized thoughts and conversations given to the Japanese who perished on the Shinano.  Obviously, there's no way to ever know what these people actually said or thought.  It makes it all so less real, and more like a novel, to try to animate them with artificial conversations and thought processes.<br /><br />The most fascinating aspect of this tale for me was the stark contrast between the military cultures that gave rise to the success of Captain Enright and the failure of Captain Abe.<br /><br />One might expect that the Japanese code of bushido, designed for a warrior culture, would enhance the fighting abilities of a military.  Perhaps bushido worked great in the ancient days of quick and decisive sword battles, but as this book makes so very clear, bushido fails miserably in a prolonged modern war.<br /><br />One big flaw in bushido was that very time a leader failed at a major assignment, he was expected to commit suicide to atone for his shameful failure.<br /><br />The book presents a parable-like contrast between Abe's career and the career of Captain Enright.  Enright started off as a big failure, missing an attack with a Japanese aircraft carrier because he failed to trust the consensus opinion of his crew (that the changing ocean currents which they discovered would carry the Japanese carrier they were chasing off course) and instead went with the by-the book headquarters prediction of the location of the carrier.<br /><br />Sending himself to the back lines in shame, Enright,  unlike the Japanese ship captains, did not commit suicide, but was instead eventually given a second chance at commanding a submarine  again.  The second time around, he learned to go fully with his own instincts, and also that of his crew, in the process of tracking and sinking the Shinano.  One big payoff in particular was his decision to set the running depth of his torpedoes to 10 feet instead of the official 30 feet.  This ended up putting the torpedoes right at the upper joint of the anti-torpedo blister carried on the underwater hull of the Shinano.  This joint area turned out to be a defective weak point in the anti-torpedo shielding, and it was this defect (along with incompletely finished watertight compartments that leaked) that allowed the Shinano to be sunk with only four torpedoes.<br /><br />A second big failing of bushido was that the subordinates were supposed to follow the orders of the leader unquestioningly.  This works great in a military if the leader makes wise decisions all the time, but basically gets all the subordinates killed if the leader is wrong.  As WWII progressed, and its initial victories faded, the Japanese military culture clearly suffered severely from an inflexible top-down decision making process that was incapable of taking advantage of information or experience accumulated by the lower ranks.<br /><br />In contrast, Captain Enright learned from his early failures to trust the advice of his subordinates, which proved invaluable as they stalked the Shinano.<br /><br />In the end, the sinking of the Shinano was not as dramatic of an achievement as one might think, and was due as much to Japanese military stupidity as anything else.  It was sunk basically on a short trip to another dock where it was to be fully outfitted for war.  As such, the ship was unfinished and its mechanical integrity untested.  Despite the enormous amount of armor, the ship's supposedly watertight compartments were not fully sealed  when it set off on the trip, and so leaked horribly when the torpedoes struck - which was why it sank with only four holes in its side (in contrast, the Shinano's sister ships, the Yamato and Musashi, each took some 15-20 torpedo hits and uncounted numbers of bombs before sinking).  The boilers were not all installed, and so the ship's speed was barely greater than that of the submarine initially, and dropped to below the submarine's speed when an overheating bearing forced one of the propellar shafts to be slowed down.  The ship was given no aircraft to cover this trip.<br /><br />The code of bushido made it impossible for any subordinates to point out the many flaws in the construction of the ship, or to question the wisdom of sending the Shinano on its maiden voyage, unfinished and unprotected, right into waters that were known to be infested with American submarines.<br /><br />Captain Abe also made some horribly bad decisions - mainly in ignoring Enright's submarine rather than trying to sink it or run away from it when they first discovered the sub.  I definitely got the feeling that Abe was appointed ship's captain only because he was a known quantity who diligently followed orders, and was one of the few ranking Naval captains who had  managed to survive this late into the war.  By this time in the war, bushido had taken the lives of many more capable captains than he.ombs before sinking).

At the time, it was hugely important in the decision to intern some 100,000 Japanese-Americans living in Hawaii and the West Coast.  Simply put, there was a very real fear that in the event of a Japanese invasion of these two areas (which seemed very real after the attack on Pearl Harbor) the local Japanese-Americans would aid the enemy as had happened on Niihau.<br />Time passes, and political correctness, revisionist history, and the very isolation of the island of Niiahu  (which cannot be visited except by permission of the locals or from the Robinson landowners) have all caused this story to disappear into the land of forgotten memories.  Nowadays, the PC thinking is that the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII was a misguided result of paranoia and racism on the part of the American government, and that the US had nothing to fear.<br />I have read a lot of WWII history and had never come across this story before.  About two weeks ago, while vacationing in Hawaii, I found this book in the gift shop of the Visitor's Center of the Arizona Memorial.  I was waiting for my scheduled ferry ride out to the USS Arizona Memorial, and speed-read/browsed through this book.  I have since filled in some of the details that I missed on my cursory reading of this book with some Internet searches.<br />The book is written with a chatty, semi-novelized style, typical of so much of current non-fiction history today.  I still have a hard time with this style of writing, especially when the author starts to put words and thoughts into the heads of characters in the story that die later on in the story, well before they could have told anybody to record this information for posterity.<br />Such was how Shigenori Nishikaichi was introduced in this book, wondering what to do as his A6M2 Zero fighter slowly leaked out its last bit of gas.  While participating in the attack on Pearl Harbor, the plane's gas tanks were hit by gunfire.  Nishikaichi ended up crash-landing in a rough field on Niihau.<br />A group of native Niihauans, although unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor (there was no radio on the island), were suspicious enough of his arrival in a shot-up combat aircraft from Japan to take him prisoner, after first confiscating his gun and his military papers.<br />The two Japanese men on the island were then brought in by the Niihauns to translate for them.  It was the Niihauns' intent to hold the pilot and deliver him to the owner of Niihau, Aylmar Robinson, when he stopped by on his weekly visit to the island<br />In secret conversation with the two Japanese, the pilot turned them against the natives.  The older Japanese, who was born in Japan and was married to a Niihaun woman, later became terribly conflicted and fled into the hills for the duration of the incident.<br />The other Japanese, Yoshio Harada, who had been born in the Hawaiian islands and was married to a Japanese woman, gave full support to the pilot's schemes.  He found the pilot's gun, as well as another gun (the only other one on the island), and used these to free the pilot.  The two then went on a rampage, threatening and terrorizing the native Niihauns.  They were trying to recover the pilot's confiscated papers.  They also went back to the Zero fighter plane and set it on fire to keep it out of the hands of the US (the US military would not again have an opportunity to get hold of an intact Zero to study until July 1942)<br />As this was going on, a group of native Niihauns escaped and began the arduous journey by rowboat to the island of Kauai in order to get help.  Aylmar Robinson had not been able to come to the island because travel between the islands had been restricted after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  A detachment of US troops landed on Niihau about two days later.<br />By then the whole incident was over, mainly because of the courage of one of the Niihauns, Ben Kanahele,  He got fed up with the threats from the pilot and Harada, and so he (and his wife) attacked them.  In the struggle,  Nishikaichi shot Kanahele three times, before Kanahele smashed him into a stone wall and killed him.  At that point, Harada committed suicide with the other gun.  Kanahele survived to tell many versions of his tale to many people, and was later awarded the purple heart and Presidential Medal of Merit.<br />Harada's wife was jailed for much of the rest of the war.  Had Yoshio Harada lived, he almost certainly would have been convicted of treason and executed.  After all, he had aided in the escape of an enemy combatant, helped destroy a valuable piece of military  intelligence (the Zero fighter plane), and participated in the terrorization of the native Niihauns.<br />At the time, the Niihau incident was a big story locally, and was also well known to the military and the rest of the government.  A song was written about it, and the incident was recorded into many of the early stories and books written about the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The incident confirmed the worst fears of the US government and military.  An American citizen of Japanese descent, with a previously spotless record, when confronted by an enemy Japanese, chose to abet and give aide and comfort to the enemy that looked just like him.<br />All in all, it is good to read this book, and to remember the facts as they actually were in the dark days at the beginning of WWII for America.because of the courage of one of the Niihauns, Ben Kanahele,  He got fed up with the threats from the pilot and Harada, and so he (and his wife) attacked them.

He only occasionally manages to fire his gun, rarely to any effect.  His location at any one moment in the book is just as baffling to him as it is to the reader.  He has no idea of what or who is advancing on him or why he is even in any particular location.  Tanks and heavy weapons he encounters are just tanks and heavy weapons.  Several times, I wanted to scream out, what kind of tanks are those that you saw out there?  Tigers?  Panthers?  T-34's?  You know, basic stuff that even the novice WWII history buff would know.  Not a clue.<br />There are lots of descriptions of soldiers and civilians getting killed, of mangled bodies, of the cruelty of SS and SA \\"chain dogs\\" (assigned to hunt down and execute deserters and otherwise terrorize other Germans, military and civilian alike) in the final days of the Third Reich.  A surprising amount of the really detailed verbiage in this book is spent describing what the author eats, practically every single day.  It's just amazing to me that the guy could remember exactly what was in that tin of meat he just opened up, but can't tell the reader what kind of tank that was that just almost killed him.<br />About the only interesting vignettes from this book, the only topic that I have not seen set down in other \\"soldier's tale\\" books of this type, are the descriptions of the author's brief tryst with a German teen age girl right before his group of teenagers gets slaughtered in battle, and of the existence of \\"SS girl volunteers\\" whose main function seems to have been to bed down the German soldiers that they encountered.  These scenes really do remind you that even in the midst of war, these were just high school teenagers, complete with raging hormones.<br />But don't buy the book for that reason either.  These parts are very much PG-13 rated.<br />Not much value as military history overall.istence of \\"SS girl volunteers\\" whose main function seems to have been to bed down the German soldiers that they encountered.

This book was published in the  U.S. in 1968 as &quot;The Fall of Berlin&quot;.  The book is out of print  but you can still occasionally find them through one of the online auction  houses.  I paid $12 for my copy.<br />Chuikov's tale of the endgame of WWII in  Europe is a fascinating contrast to his first book, &quot;The Battle for  Stalingrad&quot;.  This book begins with Chuikov's 8th Guards Army fending  off a German counterattack at the Dniester River and ends with the final  surrender of the Germans in Berlin.  By this time, Chuikov and his 8th  Guards have become the &quot;go-to&quot; guys for the Soviet Army.  Having  proven themselves in Stalingrad, they know in advance that they have been  selected for the final storming of Berlin.<br />Chuikov reveals himself to be  a fascinating character - keenly observant and insightful about both  military tactics and human nature, honest to the point of bluntness,  personally courageous under fire, and intolerant of fools, cowards, and  military stupidity.  He is also a diehard Communist, and more than capable  of sucking up to the right people (like Nikita Khrushchov, who he first met  at Stalingrad).<br />Chuikov's 8th Guards are called upon to undertake a wide  range of difficult assignments, ranging all the way from the savage  guerilla style defense of Stalingrad, blitzkrieg attacks on the German  defensive line at the Bug River, storming the fortress at Kustrin (another  Soviet General had made the mistake of incorrectly reporting to Moscow that  the fortress had already been taken when it had only been bypassed -  Chuikov the trusty go-to guy was called upon to bail everybody out of this  embarrassing dilemma), and then finally the &quot;honor&quot; of storming  Berlin.<br />It is worth noting that while street to street fighting is a  virtual anathema to most of the Western world's military, here in this  book, Chuikov describes an outline of how it is to be done correctly.  In  essence, Chuikov gives leeway for planning the attacks on individual  buildings and streets to small groups of soldiers, the storm groups, and  lets them decide on the proper usage of artillery and tanks, making sure  that his soldiers have plenty of both.  The storm groups were always led by  veteran and proven soldiers.  It is interesting to contrast this approach  to the top-heavy approach of the Germans at Stalingrad, and how the Germans  never figured out how to use their troops, tanks, and artillery as well as  the Russians.  A great deal of Chuikov's success, it becomes clear, came  from his ability to select and surround himself with subordinates who could  carry out his orders while acting and thinking independently.<br />Of  course, Chuikov does not mention in this book the heavy casualties that his  8th Guards suffered or about the rape and pillaging by Soviet soldiers in  the conquered German territories.  Or about the tens of thousands of  Russian soldiers who were executed so that the rest would fight  bravely.<br />Chuikov wrote the book, it seems, primarily to counter the  impression left by the memoirs of the defeated German generals, that the  Soviets won only because of superior numbers of men and weapons.  Indeed,  the Soviets did have an overwhelming advantage, but military quality also  counted - it still took someone with the brains to figure out how to get  the job done.

War is natural selection for the meek.	A lot of people have questioned whether this book is fiction or nonfiction.<br />Probably Sajer did fill in a few details with his imagination, but most of the events of this book ring true.<br />Sajer's  book reminds me more of Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot;, which  was marketed as a science-fiction novel, but (apart from the aliens from  outer space) was actually based on Vonnegut's real-life experiences in  WWII.  It was one of many books of that era in which American soldiers in  WWII were for the first time portrayed not as all-powerful heroes, but as  suffering human beings trying their best to survive a horrendous  ordeal.<br />Sajer's book explains the reality of the Biblical prohecy  &quot;the meek shall inherit the earth&quot;.<br />Virtually all the  survivors at the end of his story were the soldiers who were the best at  keeping their heads down and staying alive and out of trouble; none of the  best warriors in his group seem to have survived.  In modern warfare, if  you have the warrior's willpower to fight for your country, the chances of  surviving are pretty small (unless you're just incredibly lucky, like Ernst  Junger in &quot;Storm of Steel&quot;).<br />The devastating ability of  organized warfare to  eradicate large numbers of warriors from the gene  pool must surely be responsible for the continuous cycles of the rise and  fall of warrior nations in human history.<br />And so it goes.	1999-06-22

If this is the first or  second book that you have ever read about the battle, the sheer horrific  nature of this epic struggle, the enormity of the human suffering, and the  absolute evil willpower of the leaders (Hitler and Stalin) driving this  struggle will be so overwhelming that the simple act of the telling of this  tale will overcome most of the writing flaws in this book, and the book  will probably be an interesting read for you.<br /><br />However, having read  several other accounts of this battle already, I have to agree with the  majority of other reviewers in this situation that the book comes across as  vaguely unsatisfying, and not particularly well written.<br /><br />As with many  of the other accounts of the battle, as the story progresses to the end  stage battles, the viewpoints of the sources take on an increasingly  Russian tone, probably because few survivors made it out of the German  side.  Details of the various end stage battles also become increasingly  blurred and confused in this book and the focus of the book shifts mainly  towards documenting the human suffering of both sides at the end of the  battle, with the author putting a particularly strong emphasis on detailing  the brutal efficiency of the NKVD punishment squads.<br /><br />One final point  - the author has an annoying habit of rather casually dismissing as  nonfactual certain legends or vignettes that have risen out of the  Stalingrad conflict, without giving any supporting information or  documentation of his research.  For example, he disses the legend of the  sniper duel between Zeitsev and his German counterpart, and he also  dismisses as a complete fabrication the entire book &quot;Last Letters from  Stalingrad&quot;.  He presents these scholarly opinions as virtual truths,  and yet gives no supporting evidence.ths,  and yet gives no supporting evidence.	1999-02-14

Originally turned down by over a dozen publishers, &#34;The Forever War&#34; has become a classic of science fiction, albeit a controversial one. Haldeman creates a future society where rampant sexual promiscuity is the norm in an uncaring military regime.  Although there are exciting scenes of battle, much of the book is taken up with an exploration of the philosophical ramifications of such a society.  The book discusses the necessity of government-imposed homosexuality as a form of birth control and the importance of using mind-altering drugs in the military culture.  Haldeman's social theories are quite unpalatable and occasionally irresponsible.  However, the book is frequently exciting and the details of the society are fascinating.  This is an entertaining and thought-provoking book, but it should not be used as a political manifesto.  The most interesting feature of &#34;The Forever War&#34; is its  fascinating glimpse into America's struggle for a post-Vietnam War  identity, told as a heroic tale of interstellar conflict.<br /><br />Sounds  familiar?  The military culture  described in this book is closer to that which was parodied in  &#34;MASH&#34;, &#34;Kelly's Heroes&#34; and the other hip war movies  of the 70's, and would probably not be very effective if it existed in  reality.<br /><br />In summary, this book is not only derivative but also  readily dates itself.<br /><br />Frankly, I enjoyed watching the movie  &#34;Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery&#34;, a lot more than  this book.	1998-12-06

His methods are endorsed around the world, and by some of the best coaches in the U.S. (e.g., Anson Dorrance of UNC, originator of the &quot;Win Forever&quot; slogan of U.S. women's soccer - you must read his book if you coach girls/women's soccer).  Licensed Coerver Coaching youth soccer camps abound, and many of the better soccer camps have incorporated elements of the Coerver Method into their training.<br /><br />What gave Coerver his start was the trend for European soccer in the late 1960's on through the early 1980's to develop into a sterile, defensively oriented passing game.  Teams that had gifted ball control artists were routinely strangled by the tactic of heavy fouling.  The concept of &quot;direct soccer&quot; was developed to use as few passes as necessary to put players into scoring position..  Although highly useful as a tactic and style of play, used to the complete exclusion of developing ball control skill, it quickly degenerated into simple  &quot;kick and run&quot; soccer.  The English version of this became known as &quot;English long ball&quot;.  <br /><br />Fortunately for world soccer, over the last fifteen years, by making a series of rules changes, FIFA has worked at both encouraging a more offensively oriented style of play and discouraging excessive fouling.  FIFA came to realize that people the world over (not just Americans) hated having to watch boring soccer.  Individual style and flair have reappeared in world soccer as South Americans, Africans, and Eastern Europeans have spread out to teams around the globe.. <br /><br />There continue to be proponents of the &quot;kick and run&quot; style of soccer coaching, especially in the United States.  There is a simple reason for this.  Due to the lack of an established soccer culture in this country, it takes an enormous amount of team practice time to train even one player how to properly execute soccer moves. There is just so much that a team coach has to do already to get his team ready that there is simply not much time left to devote to practicing soccer moves.  It is much easier for a team coach saddled with highly athletic but relatively less skillful players to win games by playing &quot;direct soccer&quot; or some other version of &quot;kick and run&quot; soccer.  Getting players to perfect one or two moves at the youth level is about all that can be reasonably expected, given the fact that most youth club teams practice only two to three times a week.  <br /><br />If a player wants to progress at a greater rate, the players and their parents must have the dedication to go out and practice more frequently.  A team coach can only show his/her players how the moves work, but the players must find the extra time to go out and practice on their own, or with their parents, siblings, or friends.  In countries with established soccer cultures, that is exactly what happens, and that is how the really great world class players develop.<br /><br /> &quot;Kick and run soccer&quot; works until a team that only knows how to play this way runs up against another team that can both pass AND do moves.  The team with the moves will win most of the time.<br /><br />I always like to compare the situation with U.S. soccer to the situation with U.S. basketball.  Basketball is one sport where the rest of the world has pretty much caught up to the U.S. in tactics and coaching, and yet   American basketball players remain superior in one area still, and that is in doing one-on-one moves to beat an opponent.  These moves give an extra dimension to American basketball players that other countries simply can't match.  Why don't other countries just teach their players how to do these basketball moves?  Well, I'm sure they do, but, if you've ever watched the movie &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; you will realize that the terrific basketball moves of American players are developed at an incredibly early age, out on the playgrounds, with weekly and daily episodes of one-on-one scrimmages.  The intense culture of basketball that exists in the U.S. is what allows for such development.  Eventually, by the high school ages, the speed of execution of these moves is just phenomenal, something that players in other countries that start basketball later (and don't practice as often) can't match.   Not surprisingly, the basketball teams of other countries play mostly a game of &quot;pass and shoot&quot;, just like American soccer tends to play &quot;kick and run&quot;.  Rarely do you see the artistry of a Michael Jordan or an Allen Iverson going one on one and beating his opponent with either a drive to the basket or a late dump off pass to an open teammate.  <br /><br />Okay, enough philosophizing, back to the book.<br /><br />I view the Coerver books and videos now as only an inspirational starting point for ideas, not as a cookbook recipe for success.  There are simply too many moves, lumped together in too much of a jumbled fashion, to give a soccer coach a clear outline of how to proceed.  Some important concepts are simply not detailed in the core Coerver books and videos.  Without meaning to sound like I know better than the Coerver Coaching staff, here are some of the things that I've discovered on my own:<br />1. A number of the moves described in the Coerver books and videos just won't work very well in reality, especially the ones that don't move the ball and take a long time to unfold (e.g., the double scissors move).  At advanced levels, defenders are trained to keep their eyes on the ball, to ignore the body feints, and to go for the ball if need be with a slide tackle that will take out the offensive player if he happens to touch the ball past the defender.  Rarely do you see the more complex moves usedat the very highest levels of professional soccer <br />2. Each soccer move works best only for certain situations, which can be categorized by the direction that the defender is coming at the offensive player, relative to the position of the offensive player and the location of the ball.  This is an organizational concept that is missing from Coerver's teachings.  As it turns out, the bulk of the moves in the Coerver books and videos are designed for getting an opening past a defender in direct head-on confrontations.   Turn moves (for a defender coming from behind) and stop and go moves (for a defender running side by side) are also very useful, but are not covered in any detail by the Coerver books and videos.  <br />3. Players blessed with exceptional speed and quickness don't need to learn fancy moves.  They can make one or two very simple moves (e.g., the left footed inside and outside cut moves of Maradona) work for them ALL THE TIME because of the speed, balance, and timing of their execution.  Such players only get slowed down if you try to teach them too many of the complex moves.  This would be like teaching Nolan Ryan in his prime how to throw the knuckleball and screwball, instead of just letting him use his fastball. <br />4. Learning the moves should be coupled with shooting/passing drills for timing and accuracy.  At advanced levels, doing a move will often not spring the offensive player completely free but will only give him/her a half step opening in which to let loose either a pass or a shot on goal.  The defensive marking at advanced levels is so tight that doing a move is often necessary just to get off a pass (hence the need for learning moves!).  Moves are also an important part of developing shooting touch.  Frequently, the setup to a shot on goal requires that the player do a move to get an opening against a defender.  <br />5. The Coerver teachings deal with only one aspect of ball control - that of using dribbling skills to beat an opponent one on one.  There are a lot of other important ball control skills that need to be practiced extensively as well, such as trapping balls from every height and direction, heading the ball, and developing shooting/passing touch.   Watch the best players in the world at the World Cup.  See Romario score against the Netherlands (1994) with a one-touch half-volley shot, taken at a full sprint, with a world-class defender glued to his side barely six inches behind him, off of a flighted crossing pass that only he could reach.  Beautiful soccer, a skill both conceptually simple and difficult to master, executed with tremendous precision and speed, under enormous defensive pressure. He probably had practiced this several thousand times before in his lifetime, to reach this level of perfection, to score that one goal.<br /><br />I could just go on and on.  It is crucial that these moves and skills be taught at the earliest age possible.  With practice, children have the coordination to do simple cut moves already by the age of 5 or 6.  If a soccer player has not learned moves by age 12, he or she will not likely have	1998-06-01

This is a richly detailed book describing the development and internal workings of the Allied aircraft piston engines of World War II.  It was not written for the novice - an underlying understanding of how internal combustion engines work is required, as well as some historical background on the aircraft the engines were used in.  With this in mind, the book serves as a rich dessert for anyone interested in either piston engines or World War II military aircraft.  Besides the fine technological details and engineering drawings, the book goes into the details of how the mating of certain engines with certain airframes resulted in aircraft with a certain look or performance (or, sometimes, underperformance).  For example, the P-38's did not do as well in Europe as they did in the Pacific, mainly because of the Army's insistence on keeping the Allison engine with its troublesome turbosupercharger instead of switching to the Merlin engine.  The Army's obsession with the turbosupercharger also resulted in the oversized P-47.  The P-51 happened almost by accident - it was the result of a private design by North American and a field modification by the RAF - mating a perfect airframe with the better Merlin engine.  Although it was eventually ordered by the thousands by the US Army Air Force, it was never written into any official specs.<br />I would have liked to have seen a companion section (however brief) on German and Japanese aircraft engines as well.	1998-01-30
US	53063886	R2VESGCIFKEAGX	0441783589	242880671	Starship Troopers	Books	2	11	24	N	Y	Classic Heinlein - interesting ideas, bad writing	Okay, after reading every one of the reviews posted here, I'm going to write my own review of this book and try not to repeat what others have said already.<br /><br />I have to start by saying that although I don't particularly like Robert Heinlein's works, I also disagree with the Amazon.com review for \\"Starship Troopers\\", which smacks of simplistic knee-jerk liberalism.<br /><br />When I was a teenager, I loved to read science fiction.  Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke were my favorite authors, and I read every work of science fiction that the two of them had ever written.  Robert Heinlein's works were there on the same bookshelves at the local libraries, and I read about a half a dozen of them, such as \\"A Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\", \\"Orphans in the Sky\\", and \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\".  Once I became familiar with Heinlein's writing style, I skimmed through his other books at the libraries, and then basically avoided them.  I chose not to read \\"Starship Troopers\\" at the time.<br /><br />Recently, I went and saw the movie \\"Starship Troopers\\" and was entertained enough to take another look at the book (I'm not saying that this was a good movie - many other reviews have already addressed the flaws in this movie, and I agree with them).  Reading the book immediately brought back to me the memories of why I chose not to read the book some twenty-five years ago.<br /><br />Heinlein's writings all pretty much share this one fatal flaw, in that many of his leading characters fit the mold of this stylized nearly perfect human - selfless, noble, all-wise, and all-knowing.  Seeing these characters appear time after time in his works basically ruined the stories for me.  One of the underlying premises of science fiction writing is that the author is creating a fantasy world with certain parameters changed, but the people in them (unless they are specified to be a new breed of humans) still behave like real contemporary human beings.  Heinlein would try to pass off these perfect Heinlein-beings (a special race of mankind?) as normal people, and of course they would always do just the right thing, for themselves, and for the people around them.  They would also get very preachy and launch into these long-winded monologues on various topics such as free love, cannibalism, the meaning of TANSTAAFL, etc., etc.  \\"Starship Trooper\\" is just packed full of these perfect Heinlein-beings, always doing the right thing, at just the right moment.  GGAAAAAGGHH!!!<br /><br />That is basically why a world like that created in \\"Starship Troopers\\" could not function as Heinlein intended unless human beings were somehow first genetically engineered to become perfect, like angels in Heaven.  The neat and perfect behavior demanded of the ruling class in this world would quickly disintegrate into the usual self-seeking greed which is still one of the strongest forces underlying all human behavior.  The ruling elite would inevitably use their power to increase their advantages in society over those not in the ruling elite, thus undermining Heinlein's simplistic assumption that the non-citizens of his future world could maintain all of their rights and privileges in society while constantly lacking the power to vote.  The ultimate expression of this class division would be the development of a slave class in such a society.  It is worth noting that the quasi-democracies of the Greek city-states, the Roman Republic, and the early United States (in which only land-owning males had the power to vote) all maintained a slave class.<br /><br />I want to also address the various comments on freedom, democracy, fascism, and communism/socialism, which have been brought into this discussion of \\"Starship Troopers\\".  The terms have been rather carelessly thrown about in these various reviews.  I don't believe that ANY of these forms of government are perfect.  They exist mainly because of a combination of prevailing economic or social forces at work within a country.All of these forms of government have an inherent tendency to favor certain classes or certain types of people within their societies.<br /><br />Democracy certainly is not the best form of government under all situations.  At its very worst, democracies can be highly chaotic, inefficient, and prone to producing either imbalances or compromises in society that could ultimately result in chaos and the destruction of that society. The freedom of a pure democracy works best for those people that have the discipline, talent, and wherewithal to find a place for themselves in society.  People without this ability tend to drop into the lower classes and suffer.<br /><br />In times of societal chaos, or the presence of an external threat to society, fascism is far more efficient in terms of its ability to organize and solve immediate problems. Fascism has an inherent appeal to the upper classes, and sometimes the middle classes, in its promise of providing stability and order in times of chaos.  Ultimately, however, fascist societies become corrupt, since it is humanly impossible to have total control of the economy without also succumbing to the temptation of extracting a fortune from those that need government to do business.  These \\"control points\\" of a fascist society can become serious economic bottlenecks, since no government authority can have the wisdom to accurately predict the success or failure of any particular enterprise, and yet, in a fascist society, the government will be called on to make these sort of decisions.<br /><br />Communism/Socialism has its greatest appeal for the downtrodden and the lower classes, since it promises to provide for their most pressing needs.  The obvious exchange is that people under these governments have to allow the state to make all the decisions for them and therefore give up much of their freedom.  For someone starving to death, freedom might not be the most pressing need, and communism would seem to be an ideal form of government.  The ideals of communism have never meshed with the reality, however.  Under communism, the worker or peasant classes are supposed to be the ones in charge of society, but in fact what always happens is that only a ruling elite emerges.  As a result, communism always devolves into a mirror image of fascism.  Socialism is the milder strain of communism, and most democracies have inoculated themselves with a version of socialism in order to take care of the suffering of their lower classes; in this way the democracies are protected against a full-scale attack of communism.<br />As we approach the next Millenium, democracy is breaking out everywhere, and fascism and communism are in serious retreat.  Why?  The rise of democracy as a superior form of government has basically coincided with the onset of rapid technological changes first started by the Industrial Revolution about two hundred years ago.  It has also coincided with the emerging dominance of capitalism and market forces as the main economic engines driving all industrially advanced societies.  Technological changes have been so rapid and so unpredictable, that only a free and flexible system, in which bad ideas are allowed to fail quickly, and new ideas are allowed to see the light of day rapidly, could have accommodated such a rapid advance of technology.  Joseph Schumpeter, in his classic work \\"Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy\\" describes this constant cycle of destruction and creation of companies, ideas, and laws.<br /><br />No real-life ruling elite could ever be so wise and all-knowing, as the Heinlein-beings were, to accurately predict the societal changes brought on by any particular technological advance and to anticipate what the appropriate laws and other societal adjustments would be needed.  Under a true democracy, the widest possible numbers of people in society have access to their government in order to address these needs.

I don't claim to be an expert soccer coach.  However, I do know that there are two schools of thought about how to coach soccer.  In one school, coaches emphasize simple drills to teach and then perfect particular ball handling skills (for example, trapping or heading a high ball, or sprinting down the field and then sending a long crossing pass).  These skills are then allowed to be put to use in small scrimmages, in order to allow each player to have a maximum number of ball touches to develop confidence in handling the ball under pressure, and also to allow for  creativity.  In the other school, coaches emphasize rigid pattern drills, which attempt to simulate particular play situations in soccer, and in this way, the players also learn to perfect their ball control skills.<br /> Well, this book definitely belongs to the second school of thought.  I don't happen to believe in this school, at least not yet.<br /> I have to say that the title of the book made me think that there was some connection to Dutch Soccer.  Visions of Johan Cruyff, Marco Van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Wiel Coerver, and all of those wonderful Dutchmen, who coach and play some of the most inventive and creative soccer in the world (oh, okay, maybe not in the whole world, just in Europe) danced through my head.<br />Instead, the author turns out to be really an Englishman, and the book's only connection to  Dutch Soccer seems to be that these drills are borrowed from the Dutch Soccer Academy.  The drills are really all about dribbling, passing, and shooting, in well-defined patterns.  The pages are just filled with symbols -  triangles, dots, and squiggly lines.  Some of the drills are relatively straightforward and easy to do.  Some of the patterns are quite complex.  After trying to figure out several pages worth of these patterns, my eyes just started to glaze over.  I don't know how the coaches or players memorize all of these patterns in the first place.  And you would have to memorize them, otherwise the really complex drills would fall into total chaos.<br />I can only guess that if anybody were to use these drills, they would have to be 1) fairly advanced soccer players, probably at high school or college level or above, and 2) heavily into a structured style of soccer.<br />Maybe it will work for you.

This book also does not have hardly anything in the way of tips on basic techniques for ball control.<br />There are several reasons why I give this book a slightly higher rating: First, the diagrams of the drills are more simply laid out and are easier to understand - and so if your soccer training philosophy actually includes running such rigid pattern drills, this book might actually be a useful guide for such training.  Second, many of the diagrams simply describe how to lay out a simple &quot;skill&quot; type of drill to practice a particular type of skill, rather than running a complex pattern drill.  Third, the book has some interesting comments about how the ODP (Olympic Development Program) selection process is run (at least by Schmidt et al in his region).  Fourth, the commentary accompanying each drill is better written and tells you what each drill is actually supposed to teach.	1997-11-05

In spite of its \\"classic\\" nature, the book remains as relevant and fresh as ever, helped along no doubt by minor touch ups in its numerous later editions as the author discovered new information.<br /><br />The book is so well researched, and so well written, and has such a depth of understanding and insight as to the gigantic human struggle that was the Battle of Verdun that it is hard to imagine anyone ever writing a better book on this subject.  The range of topics covered runs the entire gamut, from daily life in the trenches, individual accounts of battle, the effect of technology and weaponry on the battle, and detailed analyses of the tactics and character of the military commanders of both sides.  All of this is written in a prose that exudes compassion and respect for the soldiers that endured the Battle of Verdun.<br />The author avoids the usual mistake of historians writing long after the fact of looking back with too much 20-20 hindsight.  For instance, the Germans already had at their disposal aircraft that could drop enough bombs to have completely severed the only functioning road that the French had left to supply their troops at Verdun.  Why didn't they?  The author simply quotes a German commander :  \\"We did not understand how airplanes were to be used in this war\\".<br /><br />With such simple statements, the author reveals a great many insights.  World War I is often thought of in hindsight now as a gigantic charnal house, the first war where the term \\"cannon fodder\\" became relevant, with the images of endless human waves of soldiers being mowed down by machine guns, sent to their deaths by unthinking and monumentally stupid military leaders.<br /><br />In fact, as the author writes in the preface, the reason for the enormous casualties was simply that in WWI, the battles were fought by technologically advanced nations that were essentially evenly matched, and that any such conflict would result in an enormous number of casualties.  WWII simply shifted the numbers of casualties to a greater extent to the civilian population. In WWIII, the vast majority of such casualties would almost certainly be borne mainly by civilians.<br /><br />How to explain the seemingly senseless nature of trench warfare in WWI?  The author makes clear in this book that WWI had a unique set of ingredients:<br /><br />a) machine guns and artillery, having essentially reached technological perfection, were well-understood by the military and so were the preeminent technological forces of this war. By themselves, both were relatively static weapons, that could be defended against only with trenches.<br /><br />b) a number of other weapons which made their first entry in WWI - airplanes, tanks, poison gas, flame-throwers, even motorized transportation, were too new to be well understood by the military leaders, and so were not used to any lasting advantage by either side.<br /><br />c) there having been a period of 44 years since the last major war (in 1870, between France and Germany), none of the military leaders had any combat experience, other than dealing with minor skirmishes in the colonies. The military heads were essentially all political appointees as a result.  On all sides, the tactical thinking of the military leaders was based on outdated theories of how war should be conducted, with the only practical previous experience being one-sided wars with technologically inferior nations.<br /><br />d) the hierarchical and structured nature of society in Europe of that period led to strict enforcement of authority, making it difficult to question the poor decisions of these military leaders, until well past the breaking point - this led to the French Army mutinies, the revolution in Russia, and the revolt in Germany.advanced nations that were essentially evenly matched, and that any such conflict would result in an enormous number of casualties.

When one thinks of a toxic wasteland, so devastated by the<br /> ravages of mankind as to become uninhabitable, one thinks of Chernobyl or the Love Canal, or<br /> Lake Erie, before the cleanup.  When one thinks of a landscape of pure horror, still disgorging<br /> the skeletons of the dead slain on that spot, one thinks of the killing fields of Cambodia, or the<br /> mass graves of Babi-Yar or the Katyn woods.  When one thinks of an army attacking in massed<br /> human waves, with the resulting slaughter of tens of thousands of soldiers in a single day, one<br /> thinks of the Communist Chinese in Korea, or the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980's.<br /><br />In fact, as this book demonstrates in its truly unique way, the countryside of Belgium and<br /> France was and still is all of these things.<br /><br />As a travel guide, the book takes the reader to the places in France and Belgium that formed<br /> the entire length of the Western Front of WWI.  These are for the most part little traveled and<br /> little known to the usual tourists to Europe, and definitely not the first thing to come to mind when<br /> most people think of traveling to France or Belgium.  It is easy to imagine that after eighty years,<br /> nature would have healed the scars inflicted upon the countryside of France and Belgium by<br /> World War I, and yet there it is in this book, descriptions of places in both countries where even<br /> today, unexploded artillery shells and the bones of soldiers from the Great War continue to<br /> emerge from the earth, to be casually stacked at the roadside by farmers for pick up by the<br /> authorities.  In Ploegsteert Wood in Belgium is a gigantic unexploded mine still left over from<br /> the 1917 Passchendaele offensive; a second mine had exploded in 1955.  In France there are<br /> the &quot;Zones Rouge&quot; that remain so heavily filled with unexploded ordinance and so deeply<br /> cratered that they remain uninhabitable.  And then there are the endless numbers of military<br /> cemeteries and memorials all along the length of the former Western Front.  Most horrific of all<br /> are the gigantic ossuaries around Verdun.  The author writes: (p.163) &quot;At the base of the beacon<br /> is an ossuary containing the remains of 150,000 soldiers whose blasted skeletons were found<br /> scattered around the vicinity after the war.  You can walk around inside the base, peering<br /> through the windows at the heaps of bones piled high.  Femurs go with femurs, tibias with tibias,<br /> skulls with skulls, and so on.  Off in the woods, wild boars dig up unrecovered skeletal parts and<br /> make a meal.&quot;<br /><br />The author's retelling of the events of World War I blends seemlessly with the tour through<br /> the present day landscape.  It is a rather simplified account, boiled down to one thesis, that<br /> World War I was an endless string of military stupidity of such magnitude as to be beyond<br /> comprehension.  An example: (p.129) &quot;The Ypres campaign ended in the ghastly slime of<br /> Passchendaele.  Now...perhaps the true scale of the crime can be better understood.  Field<br /> Marshal Haig advocated frontal assaults, devoid of surprise, in the rain and the mud of the<br /> Salient, and even spoke of his cavalry breaking through into the open country.  He promoted<br /> these tactics after the Chemin des Dames, after Verdun, after the Somme, after Loos, after<br /> Neuve Chappelle, after the Kindermord at Langemarck.  It is astonishing that his name did not<br /> become a verb meaning &quot;to learn nothing&quot;.&quot;<br /><br /> The author leaves a great many things unsaid, however.  In reading the book, swirling along<br /> with the time travel of the author, one cannot but help but link the events of World War I with<br /> later events.  The author, a devout pacifist, leaves one large wormhole unexplored in his time<br /> travels.  From his retelling, it is apparent that a great many of the surviving soldiers, like his<br /> grandfathers, became confirmed pacifists as a result of the horrors of the war.  And yet, there<br /> were many others, like Corporal Adolf Hitler, who drew the opposite conclusion; that yes, there<br /> were military blunders, but the answer was not to avoid war next time, but to do it right the next<br /> time.<br /><br />The endless suicidal human wave attacks of the European forces during World War I would<br /> seem to be utterly inexplicable to modern-day Western thinking, with our emphasis on the value<br /> of each individual human life.  And so, conveniently, we have forgotten that it occurred at all,<br /> and have also forgotten that this senseless slaughter was brought about entirely by the strategy<br /> and tactics of military leaders who were given carte blanche to run the war as they saw fit.<br /> Remember that, next time anyone tries to compare the Vietnam War with the Gulf War - the<br /> moral of that story was not that military leaders should be given control of military operations,<br /> free of constraint by political leaders.  The real moral is that military leaders usually try to re-fight<br /> the last war, hoping to do better the next time.  Sometimes the lessons of the last war turn out to<br /> be useful for the next war, as it was in the Gulf War.  Sometimes the lessons of the last war, in<br /> this case the war of 1870 between France and Germany, turn out to be hopelessly out of date.<br /><br />In thinking about all this, I have this theory that the real reason for warfare in<br /> modern times is no longer territorial gain, but simply that modern societies with an expanding<br /> population of young males need to periodically explode off a big chunk of this population.<br /> Otherwise the excess numbers of these young males, with their inborn drive for establishing<br /> primacy through conquest, become too much of a societal burden.  Witness the problems that<br /> modern Western societies are having today with gangs (&quot;hooligans&quot; in Europe).  Gangs never<br /> seem to be a problem during a major war; the potential gangsters are all in the army, and put to<br /> work killing each other in a socially acceptable fashion.  Maybe there really is a reason for<br /> massively stupid military leaders to exist after all.<br /><br />One final link to modern day events.  In this book are descriptions of endless numbers of<br /> monuments and plaques scattered throughout Europe with the inscriptions of hundreds of<br /> thousands of names of the individuals - husbands, fathers, brothers, sons -  who died in the<br /> battles of World War I.  At one time, it was very important to a great many people that these<br /> monuments be put up and that the names of those killed in battle be engraved into stone or<br /> metal and thus be remembered for posterity.  Eighty years later, as the last of the living<br /> memories of World War I die out, hardly anyone visits these graves, and no on grieves over the<br /> inscribed names on the monuments.

At the end of the novel, I could think of only one question, just what was Helprin<br /> trying to say in this book anyways?  Is this a satire on the absurdities of war, like \\"Catch-22\\"?  I<br /> mean really, an ugly dwarf in the Italian War Ministry randomly mis-routing men and material<br /> during WWI just for grins?  Is this supposed to be an action adventure love story, like \\"A<br /> Farewell to Arms\\"?  (badly wounded hero meets nurse, hero falls in love with nurse, nurse dies -<br /> oops!  -- he finds the nurse alive and they live happily ever after! --  oops again!  -- their only<br /> child gets killed in WWII!).  Is it an anti-military polemic, like \\"Paths of Glory\\", with the grim tale<br /> of deserters rounded up to be shot by firing squad?<br /><br /> Or is this just a swashbuckling Indiana Jones adventure story?  Horseback riding with the<br /> Emperor's Guard!  Mountain climbing!  Rappelling down a mountain cliff with the dead body of<br /> his sister's lover, while enemy shells explode all around him!  (hitting the body, but not the hero,<br /> of course).  The hero zips around from one odd adventure to another and somehow manages to<br /> survive all of them against remarkably difficult odds.  This is one novel where the heavy hand of<br /> the Author-Creator is definitely visible, and it gets tiresome to see this constant manipulation.<br /><br /> Most importantly, this novel is such a mishmash of so many different and discordant themes<br /> that it loses its focus and power and believability.  It doesn't help either that many of these<br /> themes are strangely recognizable as coming from other well known novels and movies.  I wouldn't want to<br /> say that he copied these themes from others, but they are strangely recognizable.<br /><br />I will give him credit, though.  Helprin seems to love children, for the theme of protecting<br /> children and of loving one's children for eternity, even beyond death, runs throughout this novel.<br /> For me, this was the only theme that ran true in this book; and so I can't totally bash him into the<br /> ground.

I ordered this book through Amazon.com not knowing what it was all about,<br />having already gotten Coerver's other book &quot;Score!&quot;  This book covers pretty much the same<br /> material, and would be of interest only if you don't already own the other book, or if you are a<br /> serious Coerver Coaching fan.  If you are a Coerver Coaching fan, this book is somewhat<br /> interesting in a historical sort of way in that the pictures are all black and white, and many show a<br /> middle-aged Wiel Coerver demonstrating the moves (in the book &quot;Score!&quot;, he appears only in<br /> one photo at the introduction, looking like a wizened old grandfather).<br /><br /> It is interesting to note how organized youth soccer coaching has evolved between the two<br /> books to encompass ever younger kids.  In this book, Coerver states:  &quot;The very young should<br /> not be troubled with planned training and assignments&quot; (p.3) and later: &quot;..begin this plan at the<br /> age of ten ..&quot; (p.5).  By the time of the book &quot;Score!&quot;  he writes:  &quot;Most of the exercises are<br /> suitable for young players...&quot;  (p.4)  and  &quot;The group of exercises in the first category have been<br /> deliberately kept simple so that even beginners as young as age six can practice them&quot; (p.6).  In<br /> this book, the young soccer players all look like they are at least ten years old or over.  In the<br /> book &quot;Score!&quot;  the pictures have turned into color and the players are all much younger, with<br /> some of them actually looking like they are less than six years old.<br /><br />With both books, there is still the problem of following the footwork for executing the moves<br /> using only static pictures, and so I would still recommend getting the Coerver Coaching videos to<br /> help you with the footwork (see my review for the book &quot;Score!&quot; on how to get these).  Coerver's<br /> books are interesting mainly from the philosophical standpoint, with Coerver grieving over the<br /> loss of &quot;goal scorers and players with innovative plays or creative abilities&quot;  because of &quot;coaches<br /> who...prefer not to allow their players to engage in individual play for fear that they might lose<br /> possession of the ball&quot; (p.3).  He also writes in this book: &quot;As a result, it is rare to find a training<br /> program that encourages individual attacking techniques&quot;  (this is something that Paul Gardner<br /> also bemoans, in his book, &quot;The Simplest Game&quot;).<br /><br /> Do not make the mistake of limiting the potential of your players by teaching them only &quot;kick<br /> and run&quot; soccer.

Since then, much has changed.  I've gotten married, and  have<br />three kids, a big mortgage, etc.<br /><br />Oh well, forget all that for a moment.  This is still a great book.  It brings you back into the<br /> time of Victorian England with such vivid detail that you feel like you've just visited the place.<br /> The prose is wonderfully poetic, but never falls in love with itself.  The plot is the classic tale of<br /> the Mysterious Woman, beautiful, forbidden, hauntingly distant, and yet so temptingly near.  Just<br /> what is she really thinking?  Just what does she really want?  Charles is the young bachelor, torn by duty to marry the<br /> Proper Woman, versus his love (or is it just lust?) for the French Lieutenant's Woman.  The<br /> novel manages to bring this all to a brilliant conclusion while leaving you hanging in suspense.<br /><br />When the movie came out, in the early 1980's, with Meryl Streep, I rushed out to see it, and<br /> was appalled.  I have never forgiven Meryl Streep for taking the role of the French Lieutenant's<br /> Woman, and ruining the book; to this day, I refuse to see any of her other movies.  The movie's<br /> producers also helped to trash the novel by changing the entire structure of the story.  But, most<br /> importantly, the role of the French Lieutenant's Woman should have been played by someone<br /> with real sex appeal and a hint of danger and mystery.  In that era, it could have been someone<br /> like Charlotte Rampling; later, someone like Michelle Phillips.  Anybody but Meryl Streep!!<br /><br />I remember this book now in the context of the success of &quot;The English Patient&quot;.  With a set<br /> of terrific actors and actresses, and a gifted director and producer, the movie was far better than<br /> the book, making people take interest in what was otherwise a pretentious and over-written piece<br /> of fluff.  Conversely, I think that because the movie version of &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman&quot;<br /> was so bad, people have gradually forgotten this book.

I can see why some people gave this book a &quot;10&quot;, since it starts out terrifically.  But, then it<br />founders badly and I can't rate this book overall much higher than a &quot;4&quot;, since I don't think I<br />would buy it again.<br /><br />The book is divided into five parts of different length and quality.  The first part is a dark and<br /> thrilling action adventure, centered on the armored scout named Felix.  It is reminiscent of the<br /> movie &quot;Aliens&quot;, with the same violent kinetic energy and the terror of fighting against an<br /> implacable horde of giant alien monsters.  The pace of the action mixed with the battlefield<br /> pathos and just the hint of humanization of its characters is a powerful combination and sweeps<br /> you along, making you forget to stop and ask that one simple nagging question (as in the movie<br /> &quot;Aliens&quot;): &quot;why not just NUKE 'em all from orbit!!??&quot;<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book doesn't continue along the same path, and in the second and third<br /> parts, the author switches gears into the first person narrative (as a different character), and tries<br /> to get into more characterization, more chatty conversation, more human relationships, and<br /> other Writing 101 stuff like that, which he just doesn't seem to have a good grip on because he<br /> sure lost me there.  He should have just stuck to what he was good at, which is writing about<br /> action adventure and the pure terror of battle on an alien planet.<br /><br />So I skipped over to the fourth section, which returns to the tale of Felix.  This part was<br /> decent, but got schmaltzy with the arrival of the Masao, and the partial explanation of Felix' past,<br /> which all had a false and tired ring to it.  Maybe I've just read too many sci-fi and fantasy stories<br /> in which the central hero or anti-hero turns out in the end to be a prince or king or some other<br /> kind of Superior Being all along.  Deja vu all over again.<br /><br />The fifth and last section returns to the first person narrative and has a definite deux ex-<br /> machina, pasted together quality, as if the author ran out of ideas on to how to get everything to<br /> end while still keeping his first person narrator alive.<br /><br />Too bad.

There are two<br />main problems with this book.  One is that the illustrations are extremely crude, often reduced to<br />literally stick figures.  The other problem is that, having collected several other youth soccer<br /> coaching books and videos, I'm not sure that I actually learned anything new from this book, and<br /> so in retrospect, I don't think I would have gotten this book.  For beginner coaches learning how<br /> to coach very young kids (i.e., ages 4-8), Karl Dewazien's &quot;FUNdamental Soccer&quot; is a better<br /> book in terms of the illustrations, and in its emphasis on how to handle these very young<br /> children.  For a more detailed explanation of tactics and intermediate to advanced skills for older<br /> children (ages 8+), Alan Hargreaves' book &quot;Skills and Strategies for Coaching Soccer&quot; treats<br /> essentially the same topics in a much more thorough fashion.

However, if you<br /> haven't gotten any soccer coaching books yet, and are looking for your first ever youth soccer<br /> coaching book for slightly older kids (ages 8+), this book might be useful.  It does have a<br /> cookbook set of week-by-week soccer drills that will get you through your first soccer season, if<br /> you don't want to have to think too hard about what it is that you're going to have to do.	1997-05-04

It probably<br />would be found somewhat lacking in details for advanced coaches.  The author was a former<br />defensive player in England, and this is reflected in the structured nature of the coaching style<br /> that he advocates, as well as in the solid chapter on defensive play.  He has a lot of good advice<br /> on how to handle players and parents as well.  Offensive schemes described in the book are<br /> fairly conventional, which is probably where this book could be improved the most.	1997-04-18

Detailed, witty, and insightful, this is a terrific book for soccer fans, coaches, and players.  The<br />book covers a lot of ground, starting with the World Cup, and moving on to the Olympics, FIFA,<br />and other aspects of world soccer, as well as an account of the history of soccer in America<br /> (stopping short of the 1996 Olympics).  There is a detailed analysis of the evolution of tactics in soccer, and the role<br /> of modern coaching as well as the changes in the rules and interpretation of rules in soccer.  All<br /> of it is written in a wonderfully readable prose, funny, poetic, and always with a deep<br /> understanding of the beautiful game.	1997-04-02

Written by a German who spent WWII in his country's foreign service, only about a third of the<br />written portion of the book is actually about the core Battle of Stalingrad - the rest of the book is<br />about the approach to Stalingrad beginning with the German spring offensive of 1942.  There are<br /> a number of what seem to be first hand-accounts of battle, which sound like they were obtained<br /> from individual soldiers involved in the campaign; unfortunately, the author does not bother with<br /> such formalities as footnotes to document his sources, and so it is not possible to assess the<br /> truth or accuracy of any particular story.  Almost a quarter of the total number of pages in the<br /> book are photographs from the German campaign.  The writing style of the book is chaotic - the<br /> author switches suddenly and often from highly detailed accounts told in a novelized form<br /> (complete with perky conversation, mood of the characters, etc.) to fairly serious analyses of<br /> events based only on historical documents.  Another annoying aspect of the book is the rather<br /> unapologetic and strident German nationalism evident in the book - the author showcases the<br /> most noteworthy accomplishments of the German soldier and avoids all mention of the more<br /> unsavory aspects.  When it comes to the actual core Battle of Stalingrad, the details of<br /> individual German heroism fade out (perhaps there were not enough suvivors to actually recount<br /> these end stage battles?) and the most interesting accounts actually come from the Russian<br /> side, including details that appear to have come from General Chuikov's memoirs.  As in<br /> Joachim Wieder's book, &quot;Stalingrad: Memories and Reassessments&quot;, General Paulus is<br /> defended for his role in causing the German debacle at Stalingrad, although with less fervor (I<br /> still favor Alan Clark's characterization of Paulus, in &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, as a classic General Staff<br /> bureaucrat, virtually incompetent as a field commander).  In short, the book provides some<br /> interesting vignettes from the Battle of Stalingrad, but has many fatal flaws as a historical<br /> account.ome  interesting vignettes from the Battle of Stalingrad, but has many fatal flaws as a historical  account.	1997-04-02

For people interested in this topic because of either the movie or theater version<br />of Evita, it provides a lot of the historical background material behind the lyrics written by Tim<br /> Rice.  Many of the phrases, lines, and snide comments in the lyrics are straight out of what had<br /> already been said or written about Eva Peron.	1997-03-16
US	53063886	RM59ZPRXFZTZR	0806909765	810553808	Score!: Soccer Tactics & Techniques for a Better Offense	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	The ultimate youth soccer coaching book for doing &quot;moves&quot;	This book is intended for the serious youth soccer coachinterested in teaching &quot;moves&quot; to his/her players.  The book is simply filled to the brim with pictures of young players executing one after another series of these moves.  To this extent, this book was indeed what I was looking for - however, be warned that if you are not yourself familiar with how to do these moves, that it is very hard to follow the sequence of the footwork described in the static pictures and in the text for many of the moves.  Eventually I ordered the companion videotape &quot;Play like a Soccer Legend&quot; from Charlie Cooke/ Coerver Coaching, and this tape (with the help of the frame-by frame viewing button on my VCR remote control) was much more helpful than the book itself in demonstrating how to execute the moves, although the tape is somewhat more cursory in its treatment of the moves.  Soccer Learning Systems carries the full set of Coerver Coaching videotapes that are the original companion set to this book.	1997-03-16

In spite of the endless litany of human tragedy in this<br />story, ultimately, the story is uplifting and triumphant as it describes the fierce devotion of one<br /> family to each other as they struggle to survive the depradations of both the German and<br /> Russian sides during the war.  It is amazing how a cumulative string of small acts of kindness<br /> from strangers at critical junctures combine to save Nina's family.  Also, one has only to know<br /> the term besprizhorniks (the abandoned children of the victims of the Soviet Gulag) to discover<br /> the truest and simplest meaning of family values.  Two minor criticisms:  the author is obviously<br /> more favorable to the German side as opposed to the Russian side in this story- a lot of this was<br /> no doubt because the German troops in the Crimea were relatively benign as opposed to those<br /> in the Ukraine or Belorussia, where some truly evil and sadistic Nazi governors were put into<br /> power.  The other criticism is a wish that the ending were less abrupt, and that somehow the<br /> author provide some closure for the reader by going over what happened to the various people in<br /> the story, especially her mother and brother.  All in all, a great book, especially if you feel like<br /> you're under too much stress in this modern society.  Read this book, and you will realize that<br /> there is almost nothing that you could possibly experience that would begin to compare with the<br /> events described in Nina's Journey	1997-01-21
