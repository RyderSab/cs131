Also on the trip are a bunch of would be romance authors. As usual, calamity strikes early and often starting with Emily's suitcase getting lost and their hotel burning down. But things really heat up when the publishing company sponsoring the trip holds a contest where the prize is a book contract with a cash advance of $10,000. Some people will do anything to win and before long the bodies start piling up. All the people who were killed were judges in the contest and Emily's mother is the last judge still around. Emily wants to solve the murder - fast - before her mother becomes the next victim.<br /><br />This is a funny cozy mystery. Hunter uses the story line to poke gentle fun at romance authors and readers, critics, agents, awards, publishers, Oprah's book club and even Amazon reviewers. Hunter populates the book with humorous, eccentric characters, including Emily's hot to trot millionaire grandmother; her mother who likes to alphabetize everything, including people; Emily's ex-husband Jack, who is now a gorgeous female named Jackie (who reminds me a lot of Lula in Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series); and the assorted Iowans on the trip, including one who wears on readers with her habit of rhyming everything. Etienne, Emily's long-distance, boyfriend appears in a series of phone calls and Hunter intriguingly throws in a handsome tour guide named Duncan, who also is attracted to Emily.<br /><br />The solutions to the murders is a bit of a let down, but don't let that stop you from reading this very funny mystery.	2005-10-13

Not everyone is happy about Angel's book, which is about the murder of a debutante, Bethany Banks, including the victim's sister who interrupts Angels' speech. Someone then tries to run Angel over and shortly after that she disappears. Pen, along with the ghost of Jack Shepard, a private eye who was murdered over fifty years ago, are investigating angel's disappearance when Pen stumbles over a body that turns out to be that of Bethany's sister. Is there a serial killer on the loose?<br /><br />I love this mystery series. The relationship between Jack Shepard, the ghost of a hard-boiled detective and Penelope, a modern day widow, are what makes the book work. Alice Kimberly deftly weaves one of Jack's old cases with the modern one, writing Jack's case using the jargon of hard-boiled detective literature and Pen's case in modern day language. It's particularly amusing as Jack explains the jargon used in his time and Pen tells him about modern day conveniences such as cell phones and who people such as John F. Kennedy, Jr. were. Readers will chuckle, perhaps uneasily, as Jack wonders why anyone would buy bottled water. Not too many authors could write believably about the attraction between a live person and a ghost, but Kimberly does it beautifully.<br /><br />The mystery itself is reminiscent of the Kennedy-Skakel case with plenty of suspects and twists and turns. The identity of the murderer will come as a surprise to many readers but is believable. Kimberly throws in a nice way of Jack being able to leave the bookstore to help solve the mystery, which is great, because it allows the characters to interact and sole mysteries in several locations rather than be confined to the bookstore.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and the entire series.	2005-10-12

She knows he is married, but falls hard for him and is soon having an affair with him.  She completely trusts him, believing everything he tells her, and is shocked when he flees Ireland after having conned several people out of their money, including many of Ella's friends and her own father. Shamed, Ella quits teaching and takes on several part time jobs to help her family financially. One job she takes on involves filming a documentary about Quentins, a beloved restaurant in Dublin, which has served many people with quite interesting stories.  Ella flies to New York to convince businessman Derry King to invest in the documentary. As she is trying to get the documentary off the ground, she is also struggling with her conscience as to whether or not she should return Don's laptop to him or turn it over to the police who are looking for him. Not an easy decision as she is convinced that Don still loves her.<br /><br />\\"Quentins\\" is a mixed bag. Interspersed with Ella's story are short stories about the patrons of Quentins, a technique that threw me off at first because I had no idea who the characters were that showed up halfway through the book and thought I had missed something. Ultimately, however, the short stories prove more interesting than Ella's story, as she is the type of character that readers will feel like shaking (how she can believe Don still loves her until almost the end of the book is beyond me). I would have liked to know more about some of the minor characters that are in the short stories, especially Quentin himself, who appears far too briefly in the novel.<br /><br />Several of Binchy's beloved characters appear throughout the book. We learn more about Patrick and Brenda Brennan, who run Quentins, and meet Patrick's brother Blouse. Ria and Colm from \\"Tara Road\\" show up, albeit briefly, and Tom and Cathy from \\"Scarlet Feather\\" appear as do Simon and Maude, who may be my all time favorite Binchy characters. Aidan and Signora from \\"Evening Class\\" show up and Quentins nicely wraps up their love story. These touches are what ultimately make \\"Quentins\\" worth reading.de, who may be my all time favorite Binchy characters.

US	53011051	R196O8IOFA0B62	0671039725	769595666	Carrie	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Scary Carrie	Raised by a religious fanatic mother, Carrie White had been teased and tormented by her classmates for years. She tried to fit in, quietly rebelling against her mother when she could, but her classmates are unforgiving. Things get worse when Carrie gets her period for the very first time at age 17, and not knowing what is going on, thinks she is bleeding to death. Carrie is dealing with the humiliation of that incident, plus the discovery that she has the ability to make things move simply by looking at them, when Tommy Ross asks her to the Senior Prom. Carrie begins to think that she might finally fit in with her classmates, unaware that two of them are planning on playing a nasty prank at the Prom. Little do they realized that that prank would unleash Carrie's powers causing destruction her town may never recover from.<br /><br />Written over 30 years ago, Stephen King's first novel still has the power to scare readers. He captures the high school years perfectly and anyone who wasn't part of the \\"in\\" crowd (and perhaps those that were) will emphasize with Carrie. King has said that he didn't particularly care for the character Carrie, but I found her to be a sympathetic character. King, in fact, makes her especially sympathetic when describing her home life with her nutcase of a mother and her inner thoughts and feelings. Sue Snell and Tommy Ross are likable characters, if a bit unbelievable (King tries hard to make it work, but Sue's reasons for having Tommy invite Carrie to the prom, and Tommy's acceptance of those reasons never quite ring true). Chris Hargenson and Billy Nolan are nasty villains and deserve what happens to them.<br /><br />King uses an interesting technique in this novel. \\"Carrie\\" book is divided into three parts: Blood Sport, Prom Night, and Wreckage. Blood Sport is an apt title as there are images of blood throughout the book; even Carrie's prom dress is red. There are no chapters, instead King intersperses fictional newspaper and magazine articles, fictional excerpts from books written about Carrie, letters, and interviews with survivors and others who knew Carrie along with the action as it unfolds. King is not a subtle author, he employs lots of foreshadowing throughout the book, and he makes it clear from the beginning that most people will not survive Carrie's wrath. As in may of King's books, there are a few problems with the editing - the spelling of the name of Carrie's high school changes, and, although her father died before she was born, at one point King has him alive when she was a young baby. Fortunately, these minor inconsistencies do not detract from the story.<br /><br />This is a quick read, but an exciting thriller.zine articles, fictional excerpts from books written about Carrie, letters, and interviews with survivors and others who knew Carrie along with the action as it unfolds.

She was not born blind and deaf, but as a toddler suffered an illness that almost killed her and robbed her of her sight and hearing. Helen was seemingly unteachable and growing wilder each day until Helen's parents hired Anne Sullivan who was to become her beloved \\"Teacher\\". Helen became a proficient student, learning not only to read and write and speak, but also learning several languages eventually graduating from Radcliffe College.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary book about an extraordinary woman. The book is divided into two parts: Keller's autobiography and her letters. Her autobiography is written a bit flowery, but is interesting as she describes her early years and how she tried to communicate with people and her increasing frustration when they couldn't understand her.  She writes about how Anne Sullivan finally got her to understand the word for \\"water\\" and how she quickly learned other words after that breakthrough. She tackles what was a very painful time in her young life when she was accused of plagiarizing a story when she was only 11 years old.  She ends her autobiography by describing the things she loves in life: reading (books that she loves and her favorite authors), history, languages, the outdoors, sailing and visiting friends.<br /><br />As interesting as Keller's autobiography is, her letters reveal even more about her life.  Printed in chronological order, starting when Helen was just 7 years old, the letters show how quickly her grammar and writing skills developed. In the autobiographical section of the book, it is easy to forget that Keller was deaf and blind as she writes about talking to people and things that she's seen. Her letters explain better how people communicated with her and even the toll it took on Anne Sullivan, who had continuous problems with her eyes. Her letters explain how she wrote letters using a special board and a regular pencil and how she was able to read people's lips and feel things in a museum to get an appreciation of art. Very interesting reading.<br /><br />My only complaint about this wonderful book is the editing. The book was first published in 1903 and has been in print ever since, but I wonder when it was last edited. There are notations that a footnote will follow but there is no footnote. There are mentions of people who were well known in Helen's time, but today's readers might not know how they were and footnotes should have been used to explain who they were, starting with Laura Bridgman who apparently was the inspiration for much of the education the young Helen got. Also, Helen raised money for the education of a blind and deaf boy, but there was no mention of what happened to him later in life.<br /><br />Editing aside, this is a wonderful, inspirational book and I highly recommend it.rd and a regular pencil and how she was able to read people's lips and feel things in a museum to get an appreciation of art.

US	53011051	RJBAFHI7B2Y27	0786888741	913320116	Lucky Man: A Memoir	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Excellent Memoir	Michael J. Fox begins his autobiography telling of his discovery one morning that his pinkie was twitching, a discovery that would ultimately change the course of his life when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. He then flashes back to his childhood in Canada and his relationship with his parents, siblings and his beloved Nana. Fox talks about his struggles in school (he eventually dropped out of high school) and his success as an actor in Canada which inspired him to move to California where he struggled for three years before landing the role of Alex on \\"Family Ties\\".  For a while he enjoyed the perks of fame, getting free stuff whenever he wanted, lots of drinking and partying, but his marriage to Tracy Pollan, having children, and Parkinson's helped settle him down.<br /><br />This is a fascinating look at the life of Michael J. Fox. Readers expecting anecdotes about the filming of \\"Family Ties\\", \\"Back to the Future\\" or any of his works will be disappointed, as there is little writing of what goes on behind the scenes, in fact, he says he barely remembers filming \\"Back to the Future\\". Outside of an unpleasant encounter with Cher, little is mentioned about other actors, even his costars. Instead, he writes about his private life - his childhood, his family, his living the good life as an actor, his heavy drinking, and his love for his wife and children and the effect Parkinson's has had on his life. I liked this approach; the glimpses into Fox's private life made him seem more real. He's not afraid to poke fun at himself, especially recounting how his family reacted to his winning an Emmy. He is also brutally frank about his heavy drinking and the effect it had on his marriage. And he doesn't pull any punches in describing how Parkinson's has effected his life.<br /><br />This is a good read.	2005-08-24

Rowling begins to tie together events in the previous books, as well as building the groundwork for the final book in the series. She's a master storyteller and readers will marvel at how seemingly innocuous scenes and characters in the earlier books prove to be meaningful after all.<br /><br />One of the best things about this series is how the characters mature through the course of the books. Harry has thankfully matured since Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and is far less angry and far more thoughtful. Romance is in the air now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are older, but romance isn't just for the young as we get glimpses of the enduring love between Arthur and Molly Weasley, the engagement of Fleur and bill, and another romance between the adults that put a smile on my face. But there are different types of love, and this book, even more than the others, shows how important the friendship and love between Harry and his friends (and teachers) is, and will, I suspect, play an even bigger part in the last book.<br /><br />In between romantic interludes, there is, of course, school lessons, but outside of Potions lessons and Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore, the book doesn't focus much on them. Even Hermione seems a bit more relaxed about schoolwork. Quidditch too, while still important to Ron and Harry, seems to be less consuming to them as it once was.<br /><br />I'm puzzled as to why critics continue to refer to these as children's books as the series ceased to be just for children several books ago. Younger, children, in fact, may have a hard time dealing with certain events in this book.<br /><br />This continues to be an outstanding series. Rowling answers many questions in this book, yet creates even more questions that leave the reader hungry for the next book. I can't wait!	2005-08-10
US	53011051	RLX6XO6YQODNO	0312306261	643244690	Eleven on Top	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Super Stephanie	Stephanie Plum is tired of her bounty hunter job. She's had enough of chasing after criminals, being shot at, her apartment always being broken into, and having her car blown up, so she quits her job. She has no problem finding a job, several jobs, in fact, but keeping them is a problem, as she manages to get fired as quickly as she is hired. Finally, Ranger hires her to work for him and she hopes her life will have some stability. But one of her past cases comes back to haunt her. Someone keeps blowing up her cars (again!) and leaving her threatening notes. She's not sure who's doing it, but she thinks it might be linked to some men missing from the `burg.  And as if that wasn't enough, she has to get through her sister Val's wedding in a dress that makes her look like an eggplant!<br /><br />This was a much better book than the last one if the Stephanie Plum series, the disappointing \\"Ten Big Ones\\".  All the old favorite characters are here: Joe Morelli, Ranger, Grandma Mazur, Lula, and Albert Kloughn. There are many humorous scenes; especially funny is the confrontation between Stephanie's Grandma Mazur and Joe's Grandma (at a wake, naturally!); a scene featuring a missing facial mole; and a scene involving Stephanie, her mother, Grandma Mazur and a wedding cake, which causes Stephanie to give up sugar, causing Joe much suffering. Stephanie's attempts at her various short term jobs are equally hilarious.<br /><br />What I liked about this book is how the characters have matured. Having Stephanie quit her job as a bounty hunter was a good move, opening up new storylines and forcing Evanovich to write something else besides the somewhat tired routines of Stephanie and Lula trying to catch FTA's. Evanovich does throw in a couple of bounty hunting scenes that easily could have been left out of the book, but perhaps she thought readers would be disappointed if they were to disappear altogether. Stephanie and Joe's relationship is also maturing, which I liked, even if it does lessen the sexual tension between Stephanie and Ranger. There was a real mystery as part of the plot. And, while some might find the blowing up of cars a bit old, I found some of the scenes funny, especially the attempt to blow up the Buick.<br /><br />One last thought. While it's nice that Evanovich has a contest to let her readers name the next book in the series, I hate the \\"numbers\\" theme of these titles. The first three or four titles were somewhat amusing, but using numbers in each title is restricting and the titles have nothing to do with the books, which I find annoying.<br /><br />Aside from that, I loved this book and highly recommend it.n if it does lessen the sexual tension between Stephanie and Ranger.

Her grief is made worse because she had quarreled with Adam the day before he died about her desire to follow in her grandfather's footsteps and run for political office. When people start questioning whether Adam was involved with shady real estate deals, Nell struggles to clear his name before it ruins her political chances. She reluctantly uses the help of a psychic who claims that Adam is speaking to her from another world. But the digger she deeps, Nell finds out much more about Adam than she expected in her search for the truth.<br /><br />This was a disappointing thriller. The characters are bland. Nell's running for political office seems to be simply a plot device, as there's little talk of politics in the novel. Adam appears only briefly before he disappears and is so obnoxious that it's hard to believe Nell would marry him. Dan Minor, a doctor looking for his long lost mother, is the most interesting character in the novel and I would have enjoyed the book more if it had been about him and not Nell.<br /><br />This book could have used a good editor. Parts of the plot make no sense. Nell has show signs of psychic ability, including seeing her dead parents and auras around people, yet when her aunt pressures her to go see a psychic, Nell says she doesn't believe in psychic ability! Early on Lisa Ryan calls Nell; several chapters later Lisa has to call Nell's grandfather because she doesn't have Nell's phone number!  And Nell twice has the same conversation with two cops about a safety deposit box key. This was so annoying that it ruined the flow of the book and the story lost all credibility for me.  Finally, I figured out the twist early on, but it was never fully explained how it was carried out and several plot threads were left hanging.<br /><br />For devoted Mary Higgins Clark fans only.	2005-07-11

The trip starts out in typical madcap fashion as Emily lands in the water when her horse and buggy driver falls asleep after drinking too much. Emily's trip starts to get better when Etienne Micelli, whom she met in Switzerland, arrives to spend some quality time with her. If only she can keep him away from her ex-husband Jack, who is now a gorgeous woman named Jackie! Throw in a couple of dead bodies, a haunted hotel, food fights, and a bad case of hives and Emily is off on another hilarious adventure!<br /><br />I enjoyed this extremely funny mystery even more than I did the first one, Alpine for You. I especially like Emily's \\"Nana\\" who loves to take pictures of everything, no matter the situation. Hunter writes her speech in such a way that I can almost hear her accent as I read it. There are many funny scenes in the book to keep the reader laughing, including Emily's many attempts to be alone with Etienne and her \\"pajama party\\" with Jackie. The book is worth reading just for the dinner scene where everyone finds out who Jackie really is.<br /><br />Hunter doesn't let the humor get in the way of the mystery, however, and there are a few unexpected twists along the way to the solution.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-06-14

With the cage is a Mynah bird named Monet. At first, Abigail cares more for the cage than the bird, but she soon grows to like the bird and is upset when Monet is birdnapped. The kidnappers demand a real Monet in exchange for the feathered version. Abigail doesn't have the real Monet, but the kidnappers soon strike again, this time kidnapping Abigail's mother, Mozella. Abigail works frantically to figure out what the kidnappers are really looking for as well as where they have hidden her mother.<br /><br />This is a very funny book. Readers may be laughing so hard they may not notice that the book is long on humor and short on plot. The \\"mystery\\" of Abigail's mother and bird being kidnapped is ignored for long stretches as Abigail encounters one eccentric character after another. While the regular characters of C.J. and the Rob-Bob's are always amusing (although jokes about Bob's cooking are overdone), minor characters such as FBI agents that Abigail nicknames Moldy and Scowler, seem thrown in the book just for the pun of it. I'd like to see less emphasis on the eccentric characters and more emphasis on the plot.<br /><br />This is a light but amusing series.	2005-05-31

In past books in this series, Jane is portrayed as being quite frugal, not willing to part with her ancient station wagon, even though it is falling apart. All of a sudden, Jane has a completely different attitude, not only willing to buy a new jeep, but have the pothole in her driveway repaired, and buys cell phones for herself and two of her children. Her decision to buy the jeep would have worked much better if it was developed throughout the course of the book and she bought the jeep at the end of the book.<br /><br />Newcomers to the series will wonder how Jane, a single mother, with no apparent job, has so much money. Churchill has always explained this, and what happened to Jane's husband, in a few simple sentences in past books, and should have done it her. Jane's decision to leave her two youngest children home alone, although they are old enough to be left alone, was a decision she would have agonized about in past books and it came too easily in this one.<br /><br />I did enjoy the parts about the convention, reading it, I felt like I was there. But the book felt thrown together, as if Churchill was meeting a deadline. More time should have been spent developing the characters, several of which, particularly Vernetta are written so broadly that they are unbelievable. The mystery itself is practically non-existent; the book is more about the convention than the two attacks, neither of which is fatal.<br /><br />The Jane Jeffrey mysteries are usually quite good. Newcomers to the series should not let one weak entry keep them from reading the rest of the series.<br />	2005-05-16

The trip doesn't go as Emily expects; it's too foggy to see the scenery, the food stinks, and her hotel room (rooms) are awful. When a member of their tour dies, Emily thinks its just one more thing gone wrong. But the police suspect murder and when a second tour member turns up dead, they realize there's a killer on the loose. Soon Emily finds herself working with a sexy Swiss detective to solve the murders before she becomes a victim herself.<br /><br />Janet Evanovich fans will like this series. In fact, Hunter uses a lot of the same elements Evanovich does: a young heroine in need of a job takes one that she's not quite suited for; a running theme of her destroying something; a hot to trot grandmother; a sexy policeman as a love interest; lots of quirky characters; and lots and lots of humor. In fact, it's the laugh out loud humor, more than the mystery itself, that kept me reading the book and makes me want to read more books in the series.<br /><br />This is a good start to what looks to be a fun-filled series.	2005-04-19

At first they seem an unlikely match, Ruby, although 20 years younger than Jack, is already widowed, Jack, unattractive and unsuccessful, has never been married. But both have had tough lives. Ruby is alienated from her parents due to her brief marriage which was a disaster. She is working as a maid when she meets Jack. Jack has never had much, although his dream is to own a piece of land. Together they find, if not what they were looking for, a sense of completeness.<br /><br />The book is written in first person narration with both Jack and Ruby narrating alternate chapters (except the last chapter which is written in the third person). This technique helps make both characters seem real. For me, personally, Jack was the character I most cared about, mostly because we know from the very beginning that Ruby dies and we see that Jack is lost without her.<br /><br />This is one of those simple, quiet kind of books where there is little action or plot, just the story of two people who come to love and care for each other. Yet, it's the kind of story that will stay with you long after you've read it.	2005-04-11

I wasn't disappointed. The book begins with an overview of the history of the books and there is a chapter for each of the seven books, describing and analyzing the action in each one. The rest of the chapters deal with other Stephen King books that are related to the Dark Tower series; a detailed description of each major character in the books; works that influenced the series; discussion of whether the books are Stephen King's Magnum Opus; two time lines (fact and fictional); a mid-world glossary; Dark Tower on the web; and the poem the influence the dark Tower series \\"Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came\\".<br /><br />I bought this book because I recognize Bev Vincent's name from his numerous posts on various Stephen King forums and newsletters and am always impressed with his knowledge. This book is a prefect example, even though I've read all of the Dark Tower books (the early ones several times), I still learned things I hadn't known before. Although the entire book was good, I find the chapters summarizing the books the most interesting, especially where Bev pointed out things that foreshadowed the ending of the last Dark Tower book.<br /><br />Dark Tower fans will love this book	2005-03-08
US	53011051	R6UKAGAVJ7BDX	0743267524	778315947	Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Nice Look at 2004 Red Sox	Written in diary style, Faithful is Stewart O'Nan and Stephen King's view of the 2004 Boston Red Sox season. O'Nan contributes the most to the book, especially at the beginning of the season, while Stephen King writes more about the middle and second half of the season. Their styles are quite different - O'Nan, who became a Red Sox fan as an adult, is more analytical about the game, yet at time is almost childlike in his attempts to catch balls at batting practice or get players autographs. King, a lifelong Red Sox fan, has experienced all the joy  and heartbreak of being a member of Red Sox nation and it comes through in his writing. Some of his writing is memorable, especially the part where he throws out the first pitch, which had me laughing, and when he takes his mother-in-law to a playoff game, which brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />As both a Red Sox and Stephen King fan, I really enjoyed reading this book. It was fun reliving certain games (including a few I'd like to forget about!). O'Nan and King not only talk about the games, but their own lives, in such a way that I felt like I was sitting next to them at Fenway Park, rather than reading a book!<br /><br />Red Sox fans will enjoy this book. After all, it has the perfect ending!	2005-02-07

She arranges an appearance in the store by Timothy Brennan, author of a series of books based on the real-life unsolved murder of private eye Jack Shepard in that very location. Brennan, who turns out to be a jerk, chokes and dies during his talk at the store. There are plenty of suspects, including Penelope herself, who handed Brennan the tainted water bottle that ended up killing him.  Penelope plays detective to clear her name, with unexpected help from the ghost of Jack Shepard.<br /><br />This was a fun book to read. Having a ghost as one of the detectives is a clever idea and works well. Author Alice Kimberly does a great job of switching from Penelope's viewpoint (first person) to Jack's (third person). Also done well is Jack's dialogue. Since he died 50 years ago, he still sounds like a hard boiled detective from the 1950's and he is amazed at the current technology, such as computers, that Penelope uses to help solve the murder.<br /><br />Alice Kimberly knows and cares a lot about books and bookstores and it shows. The mystery itself was good, although I guessed a major plot twist fairly early. Still, this was an excellent first book in what promises to be an interesting series.	2005-01-24

It also tells the stories of Ria's friends, especially Rosemary Ryan, not quite the friend she appears to be; Gertie, a battered wife who is so used to living a lie that she actually believes it; and Colm, who is struggling to run a restaurant while dealing with his sister's problems.<br /><br />\\"Tara Road\\" picks up pace in the second part, when Ria's life takes an unexpected turn, and she switches houses with Marilyn Vine, an American, who is dealing (not very well) with a tragedy in her life. While the reader knows all about Ria's life (more, in fact than she does), the reader discovers Marilyn's story at the same time as Ria does. In the end, Ria's stay in Connecticut and Marilyn's stay on Tara Road, change them both in ways they never imagined.<br /><br />Although a bit too long (the first part drags at times), this was an enjoyable read and towards the end, I couldn't put it down. As always, Binchey fills the book with memorable characters, some of whom you'll like, others would will dislike quite a bit. I highly recommend \\"Tara Road\\".	2005-01-11

While buying nachos at a local deli, she witnesses a robbery and gets a good look at the robber's face. He wants Stephanie dead, but she refuses to stay inside Joe Morelli's (her on and off again boyfriend) house all day long, angering Morelli. She hides at Ranger's apartment (one of his apartments, that is), while trying to catch the gang leader before he has her killed.<br /><br />Janet Evanovich's books always have plenty of humor and this is no exception. Especially funny is the hiring of \\"Sally\\", a transvestite, as the wedding planner for Stephanie's sister's weeding.  But nothing new really happens in this book although we get a glimpse of Ranger's apartment, and how he lives, at least part of the time. Connie is in the book a little bit more and the scene where she, Stephanie, and Lula \\"kidnap\\" someone is hilarious. But this book mostly reads like every other book in the series. Stephanie's car gets blown up, she eats too much and then worries about her weight, she and Morelli fight, she lusts after Ranger, etc. etc.<br /><br />Fans of Stephanie Plum will like this book, but it isn't the best in the series.	2005-01-10

So unhappy, in fact, that Douglas McNally, manager of the plant, shows Lady Elizabeth Hartleigh Compton some threatening letters he has received. When McNally and a cleaning woman are found dead after a fire at the factory, the Fire Marshall rules the fire an accident, which satisfies the police, but Elizabeth isn't convinced, especially when she hears the victims bodies were found inside a locked office. She decides to investigate the deaths herself, but unless she's careful, things might get too hot for her!<br /><br />This is another delightful cozy mystery in Kate Kingsbury's Manor House series. The mystery itself is slight, there aren't that many suspects and it's pretty obvious who the murderer is. But I read the mysteries more for the characters and what is going on in their lives. Elizabeth is a good strong heroine, although a little too full of her \\"position\\" in the village at times. Fans of the series will be glad to hear that Earl is back, but you'll have to read the book to find out how and why! Violet and Martin, are a bit of a clich&eacute; as the faithful household retainers, but Kingsbury writes them in such a way that you care for them and actually hold your breath when Martin walks down the stairs, hoping he'll make it. And Martin is involved in some of the most humorous moments in the book, making a reader wonder if he is as dotty as he sometimes seems to be. Housemaids Sadie and Polly show what life was like for young girls in war torn England.<br /><br />This is a good book for fans of cozy, humorous mysteries.	2004-12-14

He then hires inexperienced attorney Mary DiNunzio to defend him. But Mary believes he is innocent and decides to prove it, placing herself, Jack, and Jack's daughter, Paige, in danger. Can Mary find the killer before she becomes the next victim?<br /><br />This legal thriller is a fun read. The characters, for the most part, are well written and come to life, especially Mary and her family, although I got tired of  reading about Mary's Catholic guilt complex. Jack, and his daughter, Paige, are also well written, Paige especially, who, as a teen model, could have been a clich&eacute;, but instead she is a sad, complex, character. The secondary characters are also well developed, especially Lou and cops Brinkley and Kovich. The plot had enough twists and turns that the identity of the real murderer was a complete surprise.<br /><br />This is a good book for fans of legal thrillers.	2004-12-07

As the book opens, Paris receives a phone call from someone calling himself \\"Valentino\\", saying he has kidnapped his girlfriend and will kill her within 72 hours. Paris goes to the police and runs into an old flame, Dr. Dean Malloy. Paris and Dean struggle with the past as well as their feelings for each other, while trying to find Valentino before he kills his girlfriend.<br /><br />This is another exciting thriller by Sandra Brown. She is expert at giving just enough information that makes you keep turning the pages to find out more. There are plenty of suspects who could be Valentino and his identity is not revealed until the exciting climax of the book. I highly recommend this book, but don't start it too late at night or you may find yourself staying up all night to finish it!	2004-11-23

Book the Eleventh in Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, begins with Violet, Klaus and Sunny rushing down the Stricken Stream in a toboggan. Soon they are picked up by the submarine Queequeg, piloted by Captain Widdershins, with his stepdaughter Fiona, and Phil, an old friend from an earlier book, on board. The children are in search of a sugar bowl, which has vanished into a treacherous underwater cave, so small that only the children can enter it. Unfortunately, the cave is filled with poisonous mushrooms and soon the life of one of the Baudelaires is in danger. Just as they are rushing to find an antidote Count Olaf comes aboard the submarine and tries to throw the children in the brig. Will they escape from Count Olaf? Will they get an antidote in time? Where is the sugar bowl? And where did Captain Widdershins and Phil disappear to?<br /><br />Lemony Snickets answers some, but not all of those questions in this delightful entry in the series. As usual the book is filled with quirky characters, including Captain Widdershins and his constant use of the word \\"Aye\\" and his motto \\"He who hesitates is lost\\", Phil, who sees the bright side of everything, and Fiona, who knows an awful lot about mushrooms. Viola, Klaus and Sunny are all growing up, with Viola and Klaus showing interest in the opposite sex and learning that maybe their parents weren't perfect after all. Sunny is speaking more and more clearly and while it's still fun to try and decipher what she is saying, it's a lot easier than it was in the earlier books.<br /><br />These books are not just for children, as an adult, I really enjoy this series. I really liked this book, but it left a lot of questions that need to be answered in the two books remaining in the series. This book does end on a happier note than any of the previous books, which I found intriguing. I can't wait for the next one!	2004-11-01

But she's not really sure she loves Malcolm, her fianc&eacute;, and is having doubts about marrying him, and especially living so close to his family, so she breaks off her engagement.  As if having to deal with a broken engagement wasn't enough, she has to deal with Julius who always seems to turn up at the worst possible time. When he asks her to marry him,she finds herself agreeing although she's not in love with him. But her feelings soon change to love. How can she stay married to a man who doesn't return her feelings?<br /><br />I love reading Betty Neels when I need to escape from the real world. There's nothing surprising in her books, you know that the couple will meet, clash, have a misunderstanding or two, maybe be involved in a crisis where the heroine will shine (in this book it's a car accident) and eventually will live happily ever after. And, some days, that's just the kind of book I need to read!	2004-11-01

Witherspoon has plenty of suspects, beginning with a young woman who has been stalking him. But there's plenty of other people that wanted him dead, including his fianc&eacute;e who hates him (he was marrying her for her money, her parents agreed because they wanted his title), his mistress who is furious at the upcoming wedding, his cousin who inherits everything, and the numerous people he owes money to. But Witherspoon will have no problem solving this case, not while his housekeeper Mrs. Jeffries and the rest of his household staff are working behind the scenes to help him!<br /><br />I really enjoy this series. The mysteries are always well written and well plotted. Brightwell switches back and forth between Witherspoon's investigation and the servants which I like, because it gives insight into all the characters. What I like the most is that, even after nineteen books in the series, the characters continue to grow and in each book we learn more and more about them. In this particular book, it was a little tidbit about Hatchet that made him come even more alive to me as a character. And Witherspoon's detecting abilities develop more and more each book, which is a nice touch as it would have been easy for him to become a caricature.<br /><br />I highly recommend these books for fans of cozy mysteries. My only complaint is I read the book in one night and now have to wait for the next one!	2004-10-18

But during a dune buggy ride, Joe crashes the buggy, breaking his leg. Judith calls her cousin Renie who agrees to stay with her while Joe is in the hospital.

Never one to pass up a mystery, Judith and Renie investigate the murder, as well as look for a buried treasure. Can they solve the mystery and find the treasure before returning home?<br /><br />This is another fun \\"cozy\\" mystery by Mary Daheim. There are tons of humorous moments in this book. It's well plotted and, while I was able to figure out who the murderer was near the end of the book, there were still a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming.<br /><br />I've read several of these bed and breakfast books by Mary Daheim and I enjoy them more and more. Highly recommended!	2004-10-13

When he runs the list by his Godmother, she asks him to add her granddaughter, Phoebe Marlow, to the list. When he meets Phoebe, he realizes she doesn't meet his requirements that she be well-born, intelligent, elegant and attractive. Phoebe isn't thrilled at the idea of marrying Sylvester either, she had met him before and disliked him enough to portray him as a villain in a novel she has written. She runs away to her godmother, rather than have to marry him. But circumstances bring her and Sylvester together more than once, and they slowly find themselves falling in love.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable and funny read. Some compare it to Pride and Prejudice, I noticed the likeness especially in Sylvester's proposal to Phoebe. I enjoyed the characters of Tom Orde and Edmund. I would have liked to see more of Phoebe's sisters, however. Sir Nugent made me laugh out loud at times with his foolishness.<br /><br />Sylvester is the perfect book for fans of Regency romances.	2004-09-29

As they deal with the joys and heartbreak of owning a business their relationship with each other changes as does their relationship with the other's around them,notably Cathy's husband, Neil, who is a lawyer who wants to save the world and Tom's beautiful girlfriend, Marcella, who will do just about anything to make it as a model. Also involved are Cathy's parents, Muttie, who knows that the next bet he places will be the winner, and \\"his wife Lizzie\\", who used to clean for Neil's mother. Neil's family also plays an important part in the novel, especially his cousin Walter, and Maud and Simon, Walter's neglected 8-year-old brother and sister. Other characters include Cathy's family in America, her Aunt Geraldine, and their accountant James Byrne. By the end of the year, each character's life had changed, many in ways they never would have imagined.<br /><br />Maeve Binchy is a talented writer who can create many characters and make you care about each one, bad or good. Muttie, Maud and Simon are the characters that stood out the most to me. I wish Neil and Cathy's earlier relationship had been developed more, it's hard to understand what brought the two of them together.  I do like the way the novel is set over the period of a year, it's amazing how much life can change in a year.<br /><br />I like Maeve Binchy's books, but there is something a bit melancholy about them, that, while I enjoy reading them, after I've finished it's a long time before I read another one.	2004-09-18

Shortly after going to a tea party where her friend, Dorothy Brownly Wortham, acts strangely, Dorothy is murdered. Dorothy had told Louisa she wanted to speak to her, but was killed before she had a chance to. Louisa is determined to find out how and why Dorothy was murdered.<br /><br />This was an extremely well written, well researched book. Louisa really came to life as a character, as did the rest of her family, especially her mother, Abba. The time period also came to life through the book. The mystery itself was well plotted, and the identity of the murderer unexpected.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more books in this series.	2004-08-31

Magdalena Yoder is the proprietress of the Penn-Dutch Inn in Hernia,Pennsylvania. Her cook Freni's daughter in law going to have triplets any day now.  To everyone's surprise there are twin boys born, with no sign of a third baby. Freni ask Magdalena to find out what happened to the third baby. When one of the characters is murdered, Magdalena asks too many questions and almost becomes a victim herself.<br /><br />I like all the books in the Penn- Dutch series and this is one of the better ones. The humor is outstanding and there is so much of it, that I almost feel like I should go back and reread the book because I know I missed some of the jokes!<br /><br />Another thing I liked is that Magdalena's sister, Susannah, became more of a character and less of a clich&eacute; in this book. There were some nice moments between the two of them, where, they actually bonded. There is also a hilarious scene in a diner involving Susannah's dog, Snookums, that is laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />There is also a lot of information on the Amish and how they live in this book, more so then in the earlier books in the series. That was a nice addition and I hope she keeps it up in later books.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the other books in this series, you will love this one.	2004-08-26

Gradually she begins to fall in love with him, but what about his relationship with Diana, who is far more sophisticated and beautiful than Emma could ever hope to be?<br /><br />I'm not terribly fond of \\"marriage of convenience\\" romance novels, but Betty Neels pulls this off, mainly because she lets us know early on that Paul is in love with Emma and is willing to wait for Emma to fall in love with him. It's nice have some insight into his feelings and it's fun waiting for Emma to realize she has been in love with him all along!<br /><br />I love reading Betty Neels' books because I know what to expect when I read them: a nice, sweet romance.

Magdalena doesn't want anything to spoil her wedding and tries to find the killer before the day of her wedding.<br /><br />As always, Myers fills the book with quirky characters, many of whom are suspects.

At one point, many borrowers lived in the house, but the others emigrated for various reasons and only the Clocks live in the house. While her parents seem happy, Arrietty longs to see the world outside. Her mother finally persuades Pod to take her borrowing and her first time out, she meets the boy upstairs. The boy is as curious about Arrietty as she is about him, and they become friends, with the boy bringing the family all kinds of gifts, furniture, food, jewelry, etc. Unfortunately, the boy takes too much and the housekeeper notices things are missing. Soon the Clocks are forced to flee.<br /><br />This is a terrific book on many levels. It is a book about friendship, different cultures, greediness and fear. The book is so well written that you really do believe the Borrowers exist. After all, who hasn't lost a pencil, safety pins, needles, etc.?<br /><br />Now that I've finished this book, I want to read the rest of the books in the series!	2004-08-23

I usually find books containing stories written by several authors a mixed bag, but this was pretty good.<br /><br />This book is about the Perez brothers, Rick, Rafe and Rob. Its somewhat loose theme is about a tuxedo left at their door addressed to R. Perez. Each brother will get a chance to wear the tuxedo in his story.<br /><br />Transforming Frankie by Kristine Rolofson<br /><br />This is the story of Frankie Raimondi and Rick Perez. Frankie works with her father doing construction work. Her sister is getting married and Frankie hires a date for the wedding. Rick Perez is an actor looking for work and this is one of his gigs. Frankie and Rick went to high school together and meeting again brings back old feelings. But Frankie is insecure, she feels more comfortable wearing a hard hat and boots then dressing up, and Rick has to break through those feelings.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable read. I liked reading about Frankie's family, in fact, I wish this had been a full length book.<br /><br />Protecting Maria by Muriel Jensen<br /><br />In this story, Maria Castillo and Rafe Perez, were lovers three years ago, but she left him and married another man because she thought Rafe couldn't commit. Now a widow and eight months pregnant, she meets Rafe again when he hires a limo to take him home from a party. Their feelings for each other are quickly rekindled, but they must first find out who is trying to frame her for murder.<br /><br />This was my least favorite of the three stories.  There were too many coincidences in the plot. Rafe had too much to drink at a party, so he hires a limo that just happens to be driven by his ex-lover.  And the host of the party gives him Salmon as a gift that he wants to put in the trunk and that's how they find the dead body. And there were a limited number of people who could have committed the murder, so there was no real suspense over that.<br /><br />Distracting Diana by Kristin Gabriel<br /><br />Rob Perez is a single father raising two children after his wife dies in childbirth. He meets Diana Falco while she is collecting money for charity at Christmas time. Sparks fly immediately, but because of an incident in her past where a child was hurt, Diana is certain she will not be a good mother. It's up to Rob to convince her!<br /><br />This was a nice read.  Rob's children are adorable and the Christmas setting makes it all the more fun.<br /><br />Date with Destiny introduces some of the characters that will show up in the later books Forrester Square Series and is a nice start to a generally good series.. <br /> <br />Distracting Diana by Kristin Gabriel <br /> <br />Rob Perez is a single father raising two children after his wife dies in childbirth.

In this book Vinnie branches out to include visa bonds in his bail bonds business. As soon as he issues one, the person in question skips out on the bond, and it's up to Stephanie and Ranger to track him down.<br /><br />Some of the funniest scenes in the book take place when the search takes Stephanie, Lula, and Connie to Las Vegas. Lula is on a diet in order to become a super model and her scenes made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Not much of Stephanie's family in this one and I would have liked more of Grandma Mazur, but there was more of Morelli's family and his Grandma Bella's visions about Stephanie added a lot to the book.<br /><br />A nice touch in this book is that Stephanie's car makes it through the book unscathed, but the same can't be said of the bodyguards Ranger assigns to her.<br /><br />The book isn't all fun and games though. What starts off as a simple hunt for a skipped visa bond evolves into a cat and mouse game between Stephanie and an unknown assailant determined to harm her.<br /><br />If you like mysteries with a lot of action and a lot of laughs, this is the series for you!	2004-07-27

Fenno van Linssen is a wealthy doctor who walks into her flower shop and much to her dismay, keeps showing up in her life. Fenno is engaged to a beautiful but selfish  woman who is only marrying him for the prestige of being a doctor's wife. Fortunately, he realizes this before he marries her and works things out satisfactorily between him and Eulalia.<br />The characters are great, Peter and Trottie are especially well-written. There's even a second love story that will make readers smile.<br />Reading Betty Neels is like drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter's night, her books makes you feel warm and cozy.	2004-07-19
