In this case: not. There's a blurb on the back cover from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch which says, &quot;One of the scariest and most unnerving ghost stories to come along in quite some time.&quot; Wow - I wonder what that guy was smoking.

Thinking about it, a few questions surfaced: knowing that this one was merely outlined - and not written by - Ludlum, would it be a waste of time? Reading the flap I thought, \\"Will I get lost and confused in the plot?\\" For surely, this has happened in the past with Ludlum books. My fears were allayed when I began to read and immediately became caught up in the story. It reads almost like a compendium of up-to-the-minute knowledge, wrapped around a classic Ludlum plot.

This one took me over three to finish. Why? Because it was like reading \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" or \\"The Prince of Tides\\" in that every sentence was carefully constructed and packed with content. Nothing could be skimmed or skipped. Although it did get a bit melodramatic at the end, doesn't Stephen King (my hero) do the same in all his novels? So I can hardly fault Carter for this. I loved it, loved it, loved it.<br />The book was a bit infuriating in that it seemed to give up so little of the mystery as I went along. All is not revealed until literally the final reel, and all is not resolved until the very last sentence. But perhaps that is as it should be in a great mystery novel. It did what a great work of fiction always does for me; makes me want to do things - in this case, learn to play chess, travel to New England, construct a mystery of my own for others to sort out after my death.

A decade ago I swore I would never read another Dean Koontz book again, after the dreadful &quot;Lightning&quot;, but a friend said that I just had to read this one, so I took the plunge ..... and was once again amazed at how such an incredibly bad writer can continue to have such a following.<br />  Consider this: &quot;The ball of sodden Kleenex was gripped so tightly in Junior's left hand that had its carbon content been higher, it would have been compacted into a diamond.&quot; Now, that sentence wouldn't be so bad, in and of itself, it it weren't for the fact that Koontz makes every little gesture and nuance a catastrophic event, in this case the mere clutching of a Kleenex. After a point it completely wears the reader down. It certainly wore me down. I give up.<br />  You still don't believe me? Then read this nifty chapter opening: &quot;While the slats of ash-gray light slowly lost their meager luster, and sable shadows metastasized in sinister profusion, the sentinel silence remained unbroken between Junior Cain and the birthmarked man.&quot;<br /> I'm sorry, but I'm out.

In 2002 I finally got around to reading them! All in all I loved them, but I think some of the praise in these reviews is way over the top. One big complaint I have is that each chapter title gives away what is coming, like the snippets of coming scenes in a mini-series before the commercial. I found it rather insulting. But my biggest complaint is that John Jakes is so blatantly homophobic that it would be laughable if there weren't still people in the world who will take what he says at face value. Countless times in the series there are male characters that exhibit some form of creativity (Matt comes to mind with his painting), and instantly the parents are fearful that their child will grow up to be gay. I found these passages to be extremely offensive. But other than that, they are fun to read. Certainly not great literature, more like a soap opera.	2002-06-14

Gee, why even read a novel anymore - half the people reviewing DeMille's newest give away most of the plot! At least give a heads-up that a teaser's coming.<br />The main complaint I've read is that this is a travelogue and not a thriller, but I beg to disagree. This is vintage DeMille, one of his best. Sure, it forces you to be a big more diligent during the first 300 pages or so, but if you put in the time and energy you actually learn a hell of a lot about Vietnam. I would probably never pick up a non-fiction book about the war, but now I don't have to. And it's all wrapped up in an incredible story, populated by very real and believable people.

I (like all of you) love SK's books (the only Straub booked I liked was Ghost Story - he should have quit while he was ahead) and have loved them since day one. Every once in awhile he comes up with a stinker, and this one qualifies for the stinker of the century. It was embarrassing to read.

So I was shocked and completely surprised when I came to the epilogue to discover that all of a sudden the tone of the narration had completely changed. It was as if the nasty writer (or writers) who had penned the previous 620-odd pages had left the room and an old friend had stepped in to finish things off.

I think when Brandon's on, he's right-on, as in Loose Among the Lambs and Fade the Heat. But after reading this one I couldn't help but think that he's seen one too many episodes of Ally McBeal. Judges - no matter now incompetent - would not let attorneys blather on and on and on like they do in this novel, without getting interrupted. Brandon tries to make us believe early on that this judge is very incompetent, perhaps so that he can allow the attorneys to do just this, but I didn't buy it. And the ending? Too ridiculous.

Finally, finally at the end of the novel she brings our beloved Louis, David (and even Lestat in the final reel!) into play - but it is too little, too late. I must say that A.R. has the incredibly annoying habit of writing dialogue that is unbelievable for one simple reason: she has the speaker say the name of the person being spoken to again, and again and again.

I believe that if the author had not been the son of Anne Rice, no publisher would have touched this dreadful novel. I don't want to give anything away, so won't discuss plot except to ask this: is it plausible to believe that someone who has just found out about a tragedy befalling a loved one can forget that they are standing naked in front of their mother? and then to be hugged by their mother while still naked???

I wanted to love it too, but for the life of me couldn't figure out the attraction. It was not a bad book, but it was by no means a great one,  either. Perhaps I don't have a deep enough appreciation for  science-fiction. But in my mind, there was very little sci-fi to this tale  - it was a military technical manual - nothing more, nothing less. There  were a few attempts at humanity with Peter the bad brother and Valentine  the good sister, but I couldn't help but think that there are episodes of  the Simpsons where Bart and Lisa are more engaging than these two. In the  introduction, Card explains how the idea first appeared as a short story in  Analog Magazine. Perhaps it should have stayed in that form. But no -  that's not the way the publishing world works. Instead we have three  sequels and the newest so-called `companion novel' - essentially the same  story told from Bean's point of view.

If you haven't read the book, don't continue with the next paragraph - I admit that I discuss things that are better left till after the last page has been turned .....<br />Did anyone else at Amazon make the connection between  Ingrid and Hannibal Lector? I couldn't help but think as I read this  amazing novel that the two must be brother and sister. As Hannibal whispers  to Miggs through the bars, convincing him to swallow his own tongue and  suffocate, so Ingrid has a similar fate in store for poor Claire. But in  more than this isolated incident, I found their voices to have a similar  cadence - sinister, calculating, sharper than a honed knife. I was not  aware of this voice in the first third of the novel, being the trusting and  somewhat naïve person that I am when it comes to the true intentions of  others. I was actually shocked to discover the real nature of Ingrid as the  novel progressed, and found myself almost physically pulling away from her  when she came too close to the lens of the camera (our astounding heroine,  Astrid). To follow the family-tree analogy, I couldn't help but think that  Ingrid must be the sister of Lila Wingo from `The Prince of Tides'.  Hannibal, Ingrid and Lila - what a truly wicked and cruel family. And as  Astrid snuggles up with Peter in the final reel, acknowledging to herself  that she will \\"always know what time it is in Los Angeles\\" I flashed on Tom  Wingo driving across the bridge leading towards home, knowing that he would  forever be wondering, at that same time every day, what Susan was doing at  that very moment as he chanted, \\"Lowenstein, Lowenstein.\\"	1999-08-23

Those who hated it all seem to think that Mr. Harris is under contract to us, the reading public, bound by some unwritten yet understood pledge to deliver a  `sequel', whatever that is. Does this come from watching too many episodes  of Melrose Place? (As Hannibal said in SOTL in response to Starling stating  that it was something Miggs would say: \\"Not any more  ...\\") What Harris  delivers is certainly more than a sequel - a separate and distinct work of  art. Brilliant! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And as for the ending,  which seems to have put everyone's panties in a bunch - again, brilliant.	1999-06-22

Although only 221 pages long, it held me completely captivated, and at the end, I didn't just cry - I wept! from what I won't say, not wanting to spoil it for anyone. On the first page (hell, on the  back of the dust jacket) Trisha and her mother and brother pull into a  parking lot, about to go hiking in the Appalachians. Immediately - since I  live in San Francisco - I pictured the parking lot in Muir Woods, starting  point for a hike through the redwoods. This wouldn't do! I knew that if I  started down that path (har, har) I would never be able to shake the image  of a story set in California, with the Pacific just over the next bend, so  had to put the book down and close my eyes until I could envision the scene  as SK described it - not on the West Coast but on the East Coast. I finally  had an image firmly in mind, and I was off! The story was captivating, the  characters real. I didn't want to eat, didn't want to sleep, even ending up  taping 'Peter Jenning's The Century' for later watching, and stayed up past  my bedtime, but it was well worth it. This story is so brilliant on so many  levels, and yet from the reviews I've read in major publications (the SF  Chronicle comes to mind) most people will not pick it up, dismissing it  instead as just another monster story from that hack, Stephen King. I pity  them - they are missing out on a rare treat: a totally engrossing and  deeply satisfying reading experience. Thank you, Mr. King for letting me  spend a few wonderful hours with you.	1999-04-16

Frankly, I am amazed at some of the reviews posted for this novel. 'More-than-enough@hotmail.com' gives away the entire story - so why read it at all? (I thought this service of Amazon discouraged giving away entire  plots. Am I missing something??) I found Philip Carey to be a detestable  creature, even more so than Mildred. Throughout his youth he is callous  towards those who - unlike him - do not have money in the bank; his tutor  in Paris is the example that comes to mind. It is not until he himself  finds himself destitute that he is able to relate to the misery of others.  And even then he does not reflect back on the misery of others, but can  think only of himself. The book has a great beginning, and a great ending  (as so many books do) but for me the middle 400 pages just dragged on and  on and on, replaying the same scenario over and over again between Philip  and Mildred. It was so frustrating! (Much like watching Rhett and Scarlett  constantly missing the fact that each is really in love with the other,  until due to circumstances it is too late to do anything about it.) I  cannot comprehend how any high school student, assigned this book when they  are not an avid reader to begin with, can possibly muddle their way through  this bloated novel. I will say that the last ten pages are wonderful, so  here's my advice: read the first few chapters and the last few and you'll  do just fine on your book report. Instead of the tedium of the middle, go  out and play in the sun or go to the movies. And don't feel guilty about  skipping the middle!	1999-04-16

I didn't see it that way. The story did not  &quot;mirror the problems of the 50's&quot; (the threat of nuclear war,  corruption in the media, etc.) Instead I thought it was a cheesy, sick  novel by a man who tried to set the stage, giving a plausible explanation  for the novel's events, then with that out of the way, proceeded to write a  sick, sick story. No explanation was made about why Ruth was the way she  was. Sure, people do things like this, and worse. Yet in novels like 'Red  Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs' the reader is given insight into the  cause of the sickness, delving back into the sicko's childhood. Here there  is no such explanation. And I do not believe that a group of children this  large would let such activities continue on without alerting their parents,  even in this cynical age in which we live.	1999-04-16

My 2nd reading, after nearly eighteen years. I'm not sure how this can be called a novel, as it is so obviously the autobiography of Mr. Tobias, under the pen name of John Reid. It is insightful concerning the thought  patterns of small children who grow up knowing they are somehow different,  but I found his intolerance for gay people in general, when that is what he  is aspiring to, to be irritating and downright obnoxious. He is dreadfully  afraid of being associated with anyone who doesn't fit his idea of the  perfect gay man: collegiate, handsome, white.	1999-03-14

Someone should remove the exclamation key from his keyboard, as he uses it constantly. (I was reminded of Elaine's editor on Seinfeld, who would have had a field day  with this book.) The term &quot;the presence&quot; never appears in the  book. How strange. How insulting!! How can I inappropriately use more  exclamation marks to thoroughly trash this piece of dreck?!!	1999-03-14

Thankfully I didn't spend money on this one, but borrowed it instead. Over a year on the hardcover bestseller's list, finally in paperback and jumping off the shelves, still up at the top of the list, Spielberg's new project -  should be a hummer, right?? Wrong. Boring, tedious, un-engaging, way too  long, overblown and unconvincing. (Besides that it was great!) Obviously  the author lived in Japan, conducted meticulous research and over a period  of years collected mounds and mounds of information which he wanted to  share with the world, and decided that the novel was the form that would  grab a reader's attention. On that score he was right, judging by its  success, but for me it just didn't fly. There must be millions of people  who are interested in Japanese culture, and that is what is fueling it to  the top of the bestseller's lists. But as a story? As a novel? I'm sorry,  but it just doesn't cut it. A good novel should keep you interested  regardless of the subject matter. Even 'Bridges of Madison County' would  rate higher, even though it was possibly the worst book I've ever read.  Why? It had a story, and the story carried you along. This will be  Spielberg's &quot;Joy Luck Club&quot;, I just know it. There's no way he  will stick to what's written, there's not enough there...	1999-03-14

After reading some of the reviews posted on Amazon about this piece of drivel, I am shocked and amazed. Booklist has the nerve to call this &quot;skillful writing&quot;, and someone from Iceland says that Follett is  now &quot;on his way back to respectability&quot;. Incredible!! I read this  book with mounting horror, wondering just how bad it was going to get. It  kept getting worse! What is really insulting is the fact that obviously no  one at Crown Publisher's, Inc. read this book. They couldn't have! For  example, take the scene on page 371 - this is near the end of the book, but  I don't think it will give anything away to someone who has yet to read the  book. Judy walks up to Michael, who is holding Dusty by the hand: &quot;How  is he?&quot; Melanie asked. Well, obviously this should have read:  &quot;How is he?&quot; Judy asked.  Melanie isn't even in this scene!! But  this is not my biggest gripe, not by a long shot. The writing is  insulting!! Incredibly insulting. Instead of showing us the emotions of his  characters, Follett decides to just tell us instead: &quot;She hated  him,&quot; after giving us more than enough clues for the reader to figure  that out for himself. It is sad that someone can come up with a book as  good as &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;, build a stunning career with others  such as &quot;Key to Rebecca&quot; and &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot;,  then use his clout and past track record to con the reading public into  buying this book.	1998-11-10

I read this one back in the mid-80's, right around the time I heard Rita Mae Brown speak at Gay Games II in Kezar Stadium, San Francisco. Back then the book was considered a  landmark. But reading it now it is not hard to see how far the gay movement  has come. I have often thought that in the 50's, 60's and 70's nearly any  book written by anyone on the subject of &quot;coming out&quot; saw  publication, and this book confirms my thinking. If Rubyfruit were  published today, it would probably be dismissed as so much drivel. It feels  like entire sections of the book were written in a flurry of activity, or  perhaps were dictated, then transcribed later. No colors, no descriptive  phrases, no style. Just a constant of &quot;he said&quot;, &quot;she  said&quot;, &quot;I did this&quot;, &quot;she did that&quot;. The book is  not without merit, however. The character of Molly Bolt is able to  transcend the sloppy writing. She rings true, and her sense of self-worth,  along with her fierce determination, are encouraging and refreshing.	1998-10-28

I think it would be great if someone  would solicit fairytale stories from current best-selling authors, and  compile them. Certainly this one deserves to be the frontispiece. In the  forward the editor mentions that this is a fable about the gay and lesbian  experience, and it is. Yet it can be read and understood by adult and child  alike without hitting the reader over the head. First and foremost it is a  love story. It also tells of the abuse of power, and how a people can fall  so easily under the spell of a strong personality, and follow that person's  hatred down the path that leads to persecution of those around them who are  in some way different.	1998-10-22
US	52921720	R2W5QJ5QIGA00S	0684853507	85988614	Bag of Bones	Books	1	11	14	N	N	Stephen - what happened??!!!	I really wanted to love this book. There hasn't been a big, thick Stephen  King novel in ages - not what I would call a mainstream SK book, anyway.  Last summer there was Wizards and Glass, but that was a Dark Tower book,  not the same thing at all. (Poor Stevie - such pressure from his fans!!)  And there was so much hype surrounding this one. King appeared on the Today  Show, the Tonight Show - he was everywhere! And the interviewers all said  the same thing: &quot;This a real departure from your other work, and the  critics are loving it, saying that you have now been ushered into the  hallowed halls of literature&quot;. Balderdash, I say. To put things in  context, lest you think I'm one of those people who dislikes SK on general  principle alone, I'll tell you, that besides Annie Wilkes, I am his biggest  fan (scary thought - OK, I'll try and tone it down a bit) and the  brilliance I discovered in The Green Mile, The Shining, Salem's Lot,  &quot;The Reach&quot; and other works, is simply not there. I don't wish to  give anything away to other Amazon readers, but I will say that reading Bag  of Bones, I was treated to the same great beginning that seems to be his  trademark, containing mysteries that are laid in front of the reader,  piquing your curiosity, along with great character development. You want to  keep reading, then you get to the middle and there's a kind of a lull.  Instead of reading 50 to 100 pages a day, you're now reading 5, if you're  picking it up at all. But you keep plodding through, because you know that  ultimately you'll be rewarded, right?? (Sometimes just the satisfaction of  knowing that you've finished a big, thick book is enough of an  accomplishment for you to feel good about spending that much time on  something, even if that thick book is a piece of crap - Anne Rice's Mayfair  witch books come to mind.) But you keep reading and keep reading, and now  the characters are beginning to act goony. They're out of character, not  staying true to character. And the best characters - your favorite  characters - are DYING!! Of course, people die. They do it all the time.  But here you are, tooling along, and a character who's just fine and dandy  in one paragraph is suddenly gone in the next. Leave it to SK to use his  favorite little trick, which goes something like this: &quot;Sally, the  love of my life, was eating a hamburger, and how was I to know that by the  time she was to get halfway through the hamburger, she would be dead?&quot;  (Of course, SK can construct a sentence with far more flair than I can, but  I think you get the idea.) Again, I wanted to love this book, and I tried,  I really tried!! But ultimately, I couldn't. I began to think that perhaps  he's lost the ability to tell a story the way he used to. But that couldn't  be true, because just before reading Bag of Bones, I purchased the Legends  anthology, which has a new (I assume it is new) Dark Tower story in it  called &quot;The Little Sisters of Eluria&quot;. The &quot;short  novel&quot;, as they are all billed, is only sixty-five pages long, yet in  those sixty-five pages SK made me laugh, sit up and take notice, and even  brought tears to my eyes. And he didn't do it by drawing upon my knowledge  of and love for the other four Dark Tower books. The story of the sisters  is a stand-alone, and can be read and enjoyed even by someone who has not  experienced Roland and the Dark Tower. So - Stephen King has not lost the  ability to tell a good story. Or perhaps he wrote his Dark Tower story  years ago and squirreled it away in a safe deposit box somewhere, awaiting  the day his publisher would need it, as Michael Noonan did with four of his  novels. Who knows? Still, King does what he does best, makes us interested  in the most mundane parts of our everyday lives. For anyone who loves  crossword puzzles, even for those who only do them occasionally, King's  little tidbits on the subject are so much fun to read you keep saying toyourself, &quot;yeah! that's right! I didn't know anyone else felt that way  - its so cool to share this with someone else!&quot;. And perhaps that is  King's greatest gift after all.yourself, &quot;yeah! that's right! I didn't know anyone else felt that way  - its so cool to share this with someone else!&quot;. And perhaps that is  King's greatest gift after all.	1998-10-20

I found an &quot;advance reading copy&quot; in a used bookstore in San  Francisco, and thought, &quot;Lucky Me! I get to read it before everyone  else!&quot;, so bought it. Well ... you can't win 'em all. I'm not sure what  happened. I can only guess that upon the phenomenal success of his first  book (which I loved) and the movie (which did a fair job ... I was surprised  that Redford felt the need to change the ending so drastically) that Evans  was pushed into coming out with another novel - pronto. The result is a  work which should have gone back to the drawing board. The characters are  good ... the story is good ... (I won't divulge plot here ... that's what  reading's all about, right??) but that is never enough for a book to not  only hold your interest, but make you forget that you're reading at all, to  &quot;fall through the page&quot; as Stephen King puts it. A book must have  style. You must be able to trust the author, and reading &quot;Horse  Whisperer&quot;, I was able to do that. With &quot;The Loop&quot; I was  not. At times the writing was downright painful.  I will be curious to  check this site in the coming weeks and see what others think of the book.	1998-08-13
