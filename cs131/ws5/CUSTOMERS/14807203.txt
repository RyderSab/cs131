He has a terrible, fascinating story to tell - the true reason for which the Trojan War was fought... The protagonist of this tale is Diomedes, the last of the great ancient Greek Homeric heroes, who seeks to return to his beloved homeland after years of war against Troy. But destiny has other plans for him. Betrayed by his wife, who plots to murder him and persecuted by hostile gods, he has no choice but to turn his sails west, towards Hesperia, the mysterious mist-shrouded land that will one day be called Italy. He ventures boldly into this new world, for he carries with him the magic Talisman of Troy, a mysterious, powerful idol that can make the nation that possesses it invincible... The Talisman of Troy recreates the emotions of an epic age, at once grandiose and brutal. It breathes life into that tormented time when these ancient, mysterious peoples were first settling the land of ice and fire which over the centuries would become their home and the centre of a world destined to last for millennia.	2005-09-03

But it sometimes doesn't always deliver on its promises. The average mystery-thriller reader may not appreciate the novel's glacial pacing. Literary aficionados may be surprised by occasional passages of lackluster prose. And while there's no doubt that Longfellow, Holmes and Lowell are fascinating historical personages in their own right, often they are used as vehicles for back story and historical elements without much personality. But never fear, for with the author's sterling credentials, The Dante Club is destined to remain on the best-seller lists in spite of a few deficiencies.	2005-07-11

This office bombing evokes memories for Allon because it was in Vienna years before that his wife and child had been blown up in a car bombing. Back in Vienna now, Allon meets an elderly Holocaust survivor who relates a horrific story of his time in a concentration camp. Soon the old man is murdered, and Allon begins looking into the man's claim that he had recently seen one of the army officers who committed murders in the camps so long ago.<br /><br />So begins Daniel Silva`s third novel about Gabriel Allon, spy, assassin, and when not working for the Israeli secret service, a top restorer of art in the churches of Venice. This latest story has the agent on a manhunt that takes him from Vienna to Rome, on to Argentina, the United States and Israel, and back to Europe. The plot involves the possible election of a far right candidate as chancellor of Austria; plans to revive Fascism in Europe; stories of high Catholic Church officials helping to smuggle Nazis to safety after World War II; a hired assassin; and the CIA. During the course of the story we get dollops of World War II and Cold War history, much of it sounding true to life. In one very moving section Allon reads his mother's testimony about her concentration camp experiences, a story so terrible she had not done more than give her son hints about it. There are a couple of incredible coincidences that the author brings in, but one hardly notices them because Silva is such an accomplished storyteller. \\"Death in Vienna\\" is a top notch thriller from beginning to end.	2005-07-11

But the story is no rip-off. This book unites commercial fiction with literary by the author's ability to flesh out a known plot with fresh and perceptive characterizations.<br /><br />We all know the story. April, the na√Øve young intern, falls in love with a power-hungry and kinky, oversexed senator, then disappears without a trace as if she never existed. The mother, Gloria, fights to make her daughter visible to the press and the police, while Suzanne, the typical politician's wife, struggles to keep her faith in her husband and their marriage. And the senator, as expected, cares only for his reelection.<br /><br />What we don't know and what makes this book a compelling read are the people that Ms. Hearn Hill brings to life. It's their story we want and that's what she gives us with an amazing insight into each victim. And they are all victims of their own demons.<br /><br />Each telling their story with their own unique voice, the thin-streamed plot thickens into a roaring river with twists and rapids that propel the reader to turn the pages with a frenzy. The only disappointment in this book is the actual whodunit. But who cares? That never was the point of this novel anyway.	2005-07-11

For anyone who loves short stories, this is a must read. Lahiri's stories are subtle, haunting, and beautifully written.

This is the story of Chuck Norris as told by Chuck Norris.<br /><br />Long before he became \\"Walker, Texas Ranger,\\" Norris grew up poor with his brothers, his doting mother and his alcoholic father. Through life-changing events and - as Norris firmly believes - divine purpose, he pulls himself out of poverty to become an undefeated 6-time World Professional Middle Weight Karate Champion. His martial arts career, of course, leads him to Hollywood where he becomes known - and criticized - for his action movies.<br /><br />Norris is the first to tell you he never intended for any of his life's path to happen. Yet through hard work, perseverance, humility and an unwavering faith in God, Norris earns his success in his professional and personal lives.<br /><br />The Norris story is interesting and inspirational. The story telling gets sappy at times but the writing is very down to earth. The principles he teaches as learned from his life experiences are basic, but then any lesson worth learning is often simple.<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of Norris, a martial arts enthusiast, or if you're looking for some inspirational reading, Against All Odds is worth picking up.	2005-07-07

Have you ever thought about the ones that got away? Ever found yourself thinking \\"what if\\" about past relationships?<br /><br />Journalist Susan Shapiro has. In fact, she wrote a book about it.<br /><br />In the midst of a midlife crisis on the brink of her 40th birthday, she found herself a frustrated novelist and wannabe mother with a completed manuscript that publishers kept rejecting, married to a workaholic comedy writer who travelled a lot and is unable to father the child she thought she wanted.<br /><br />And the \\"spark\\" had gone out of their marriage.<br /><br />Feeling insecure, she perked up when she heard from an ex-boyfriend named Brad. \\"I hadn't seen Brad in ten years,\\" she divulges in anticipation of their reunion. \\"In ten minutes he was coming back to see me. Not to say `I'm sorry,' `I can't forget you,' or better yet, `No woman has ever been able to replace you.'\\" The real reason Brad, now a professor at Harvard, had sought her out was because he wanted her to interview him about his upcoming book for one of the publications she wrote for.<br /><br />But still, she decided to take advantage of the opportunity to ask Brad some questions about where their relationship had gone wrong.<br /><br />She fell, reluctantly, for Brad when she was 16 and attending college, because he reminded her of the \\"fierce rivalry\\" she had experienced while growing up with three brothers. Although the relationship had ended with college, the butterflies that appeared in her stomach prior to their recent reunion told her that she'd never really gotten over him.<br /><br />With her biological clock ticking menacingly, she thought, \\"If I'd married Brad, I'd have children by now, but we'd surely be divorced. If I was single, I could have his baby without marriage.\\" But then \\"$20,000 worth of therapy kicked in.... [She] still hated him.\\"<br /><br />She spends the remainder of the book reanalyzing this and other past relationships.<br /><br />Meeting with Tom, another old flame from college, made her reflective of \\"How strong-minded, brave, and sure of everything\\" she was in her 20s. \\"I was jealous of my old self, she says.\\"<br /><br />Also among the ex files are George, now also a college professor, and Richard, a writer who was less than pleased by a vicious comment she had made about him in a magazine article she had written after their breakup.<br /><br />Her fifth ex, David, is now a dentist in Toronto. When she started her search for him, she found eight phone listings for dentists by that name. \\"There was one problem,\\" though, she writes. \\"I forgot how polite Canadians were. For three days, it rained David Greens. All eight returned my call, none was him [sic]. They sounded nice. I felt bad, like I was disappointing them. Yet it was almost fun, as if rejecting eight David Greens could atone for the horrendous way my David Green had left me.\\"<br /><br />When she finally tracked him down through a mutual friend, she learned he felt the same way. His response to her e-mail request for a meeting, in part, was \\"I would rather take out my appendix with a bottle of Jack and a dull spoon.\\"<br /><br />Her journey into the past sometimes led to self-revelation, as in, \\"The man who I feared didn't think I was smart enough was my father. That might be why I had the idea to see my exes now.\\" \\"...I needed absolution from all my father figures.\\" She also briefly explores her relationship with her mother, whose response is \\"No, you're acting like you're 15 again.\\"<br /><br />Strangely enough, it is her husband Aaron, whose credits include Saturday Night Live and Seinfeld, who evokes the most sympathy. Despite the fact that she criticizes him for doing things too slowly, for instance, his rebuttal is \\"There's a Zen saying I like, `When late, walk slower.'\\"<br /><br />If you can overlook the frequent references to drug use that sometimes make it seem Shapiro wants to be the poster child for marijuana legalization, her story is interesting enough.

Rendered in rich shades of red and gold with glossy cream-colored leaves and soft brown type, the reader knows immediately by the cover and book design that the author is creating a soothing environment to enhance the message he wants to deliver.<br /><br />There's no question that this is a book meant to persuade. Using science to lend credence to his opinions, Patrick Bernard begins with a discussion on how the physical structures of our bodies respond to sound. From earliest times, all known societies have noted that some waves perceivable by human ears are annoying while others are pleasurable. Some tones create stress. Others soothe and relax. You only have to walk through Wal-mart or Best Buy and hear the shrieking intercom system to agree that shrill sounds create feelings of nervousness and anxiety. However, it's less clear whether music actually creates a mood or whether one chooses music based on an existing mood.<br /><br />Bernard takes these observations to another level by noting that the mood and health of humans can be impacted by sound. Using holistic ideas that state that the mechanical, chemical and emotional aspects of being human are related, he then posits that sound waves can stimulate the body in ways that are either healthy or unhealthy. In other words, what you hear every day can not only make you feel good or bad, but it can cause you to get sick or heal.<br /><br />Bernard makes a good case for this core issue. He explores the detrimental effects of environmental noise on both plants and animals, repeating the story of healthy, overgrown plants that are exposed to symphonies as opposed to weak, undersized plants blasted by Rock and Roll. The impact of certain chords and tones on the human nervous system can be manipulated for different purposes. He points out that music can inspire or incite, reduce or induce stress, increase appetite, enhance human relationships with each other and with the divine - and man has used it for those functions throughout the ages.<br /><br />Bernard then goes on to discuss the power of words as symbols, pointing out that many religions recognize a \\"God-sound\\". From St. John's \\"In the beginning there was the Word\\" to Krishna's \\"I am the sound of ether\\" to the Vedic scriptures, \\"In the beginning there was the Brahman with whom was the Word and the Word was Brahman\\" to Victor Hugo's, \\"And the word we should recognize is a living entity\\", Bernard believes that words are controlling tools in the life of humans. If you are feeling poorly, say \\"I am in good health!\\" several times and you will feel better. That's because words power imagination and imagination powers action. For example, the word \\"WILL\\" impacts the mind in a positive way and creates an attitude that helps us achieve our goals. This concept is at the core of suggestology. Using words together with music to control the body is a device for achieving better health and peace of mind. It's also the basic idea behind mantras, chants and glossolalia (speaking in tongues).<br /><br />Music links philosophy, mathematics, physics and biology, but in recent years, those links are in disharmony. The call to action in this book is for composers to create music that is in tune with the universe.<br /><br />Okay. I buy that - but, I have to say, I thought his premise was somewhat limited. Let's face it, we all know that noise is bad and music is good. It's easier to concentrate when listening to Beethoven than it is when listening to the Rolling Stones. However, as I read the book all those little touches added for my pleasure began to make its mark. Before I was finished, I was curious as to the sounds being espoused by Patrick Bernard so I listened to one of his CDs. It was also beautifully produced. Decorated in golds and red, the cover was rich and pleasing to look at. Entitled \\"Supreme Moment\\", CD is a collection of twelve musical productions ranging from a Gitivali Sanskrit Chant to a 14th Century Latin Chant to a Sanskrit Mantra. I listened to it while driving through town. It was so comfortable to listen to that it blended out of my consciousness. However, I found that my mood was lighter and I was focusing on my work with greater intensity. I'm not sure that was a good thing while driving though.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you are into Yoga to begin with - or if you are intrigued with the roll of music in the well-being of our society.cal productions ranging from a Gitivali Sanskrit Chant to a 14th Century Latin Chant to a Sanskrit Mantra.

This is not the kind of writing that you consume like french fries, enjoy and forget instantly. The prose is beautiful, every word seemingly chosen with care to build up a scene or create a mood. The quote that began this review is one example. Here is another to describe the collapse of the government and the end of law and order, \\"All organizations were losing coherency, losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body.\\"<br /><br />Right from the start, the reader is given a growing sense of danger, dread and horror. The narrator (who seems to be Wells, himself) describes the ancient, doomed civilization of Mars. It is doomed because Mars itself is a dying planet and the Martians must look elsewhere if they are to survive. They look to the earth and they have a technology so advanced and a moral sense so non-existent, that people do not exist for them except as a nuisance to be gotten rid of.<br /><br />Having given the reader that background information, Wells describes the landing of a mysterious object near the small English town where he is living happily with his wife. The object is regarded at first as a meteorite, then as a curiosity and then as an enigma as it slowly opens. No one sees it as dangerous until it lashes out with a deadly heat ray, killing people. (Clearly Wells anticipated the invention of the laser!) When these first deaths occur, the narrator hastily sends his wife to stay with relatives a few miles away, not anticipating any real danger, but just being sensibly cautious. He himself quite matter of factly returns home and is suddenly plunged into the midst of chaos and danger. The Martians are on the move. More and more of the strange objects are landing. The Martians ignore all efforts to communicate and contemptuously destroy all human efforts at attack or defense. The Martians begin a sweep of the countryside, slaughtering everyone in their path.<br /><br />So everyone expects that the moment the British army goes into action against the Martians, the Martians will be doomed. Instead, the Martians simply annihilate the British army. The highest technology known to man is slapped aside like the stinging of mosquitoes. That is all man is to the invader, a pesky insect. Or, as a soldier who is the sole survivor of his unit tells the narrator, their best efforts were: \\"It's bows and arrows against the lightning.\\" I doubt that we, reading it today, can fully grasp how shocking that must have sounded to the average Victorian reader.<br /><br />That was Well's intention -- to shock the reader. It's no accident that he used the simile of bows and arrows against the lightning. Great Britain (along with the other Western powers) had been able to conquer \\"savages\\" around the world because the British had the lightning (guns) and the \\"savages\\" had only bows and arrows. Out of those victories came a sense of moral superiority the concept that Western civilization was superior instead of admitting that it was only Western technology that was momentarily superior. Wells was a writer on social issues and he used science fiction to show what would happen if the British Empire came up against aliens who were as far beyond them as they were beyond the \\"savages\\" they had conquered and who treated them as they did the \\"savages.\\" In War of the Worlds, it is made very clear that the Martians really don't behave any worse towards humans than humans behave towards each other. In fact, he comments early in his story, \\"Before we judge of them (the Martians) too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought...Are we such Apostles of Mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\\"<br /><br />Wells wanted his readers to think and feel what it means to be aconquered people who are conquered and destroyed not through lack of courage or effort but simply because the enemy's technology is superior. I have no idea how many readers of the day understood the message and learned humility from it. War of the Worlds began that popular part of science fiction that imagines invasions from outer space, the most recent being the blockbuster Independence Day. Here the message is, unfortunately, that even though alien technology is superior, humans are able to cleverly find a way to defeat the enemy.

The aliens are defeated, but not by the cleverness and resourcefulness of man. Something else defeats them and saves the human race.

It even includes recipes for dishes that traditionally are made with more people in mind such as casseroles. No more leftovers! Whenever I've seen scaled down recipes, there were always obscure quantities of ingredients that would leave me with odds and ends of various ingredients. This book addresses this issue very well by making substitutions for items. For example a quail egg is smaller than a chicken egg and is, therefore, an excellent substitute for eggs when you don't need to use a whole one. The book also has a nice section entitled \\"a quick reference guide to some ingredients.\\" It provides useful information on purchasing and preserving many ingredients like ancho chiles and clam juice. Recipes also have certain symbols next to their names if they are simple and quick or more timeconsuming, for maybe that special dinner for two.<br /><br />The escarole, white bean, and roasted garlic soup was delicious.

In fact, he comments early in his story, \\"Before we judge of them (the Martians) too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought...Are we such Apostles of Mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\\"<br /><br />Wells wanted his readers to think and feel what it means to be aconquered people who are conquered and destroyed not through lack of courage or effort but simply because the enemy's technology is superior. I have no idea how many readers of the day understood the message and learned humility from it. War of the Worlds began that popular part of science fiction that imagines invasions from outer space, the most recent being the blockbuster Independence Day. Here the message is, unfortunately, that even though alien technology is superior, humans are able to cleverly find a way to defeat the enemy. That makes for a good, exciting story, but it is not the message Wells was giving.<br /><br />War of the Worlds does have a happy ending. The aliens are defeated, but not by the cleverness and resourcefulness of man. Something else defeats them and saves the human race. The message of War of the Worlds then is as timely today as it was in 1898. Man is not the master of the earth, much less the universe. Man needs to learn to walk humbly upon the earth and value what he has before it all is lost.means to be a conquered people who are conquered and destroyed not through lack of courage or effort but simply because the enemy's technology is superior.

US	14807203	R1ZGJITB9TSUYA	0312282885	633867536	A Place Called Trinity	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Never satisfied	Some of us remember tales of a more innocent time in history, when men tried with variable success to live by God's laws and the practice of religion was not widely relegated to those who made it a career. Difficult as it may be to believe, prayer and devotion used to be part of the daily lives of the majority in this nation. Sadly, many of us have never known personally anyone who still lives by such absolute faith.<br /><br />Parr invites us to follow the daily life of one such woman who seeks to do right rather than walk the easy road. She reminds us of the heritage of our forebearers, the satisfaction of dealing honestly with the world and with God even in those difficult times that come to all.<br /><br />From her protagonist, a midwife in 1830 western Pennsylvania, we learn how she deals with heartbreak and still unselfishly encourages and helps her neighbors. The rigors of her daily work, the miles she travels to serve, her discretion and diplomacy in dealing with a doctor and his new-fangled theories, the physical aches as well as her loneliness seem to be more easily tolerated by a self-confidence, born of her faith in God.<br /><br />This tale is gently told without preaching to the reader in a style similar to Jan Karon's Mitford series, perhaps surpassing Karon in the emotional involvement evoked here. Parr leaves us wondering whether progress can successfully be measured against all society has given up in exchange for easy transportation, social security checks, cynicism, serial mates, instant meals, instant pleasures that often seem to send us moving faster and farther seeking more, never satisfied.	2005-07-04

Deborah LeBlanc's prose is a flying leap into the labyrinth of madness and self-doubt that stops long enough to catch a breath before the next hurtling plunge into the abyss. Writing with power and imagination strongly rooted in Cajun Louisiana, LeBlanc's images are unforgettable and permeated with the odors of red beans and rice and the constant lurking presence of childhood fears waiting to jump out at the last turn of the jack-in-the-box's crank.	2005-07-04

Yet for 15 years Phil Jackson was able to take the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers to 10 NBA Finals and win every one except the last.<br /><br />In The Last Season, Jackson chronicles the 2003-4 NBA season from the moment he heard Kobe Bryant was facing rape charges in Colorado to the disappointing loss of the NBA Finals in Detroit and to the loss of his job when the Lakers refused to re-sign him.<br /><br />What happened to the 2003-4 Lakers? The rape trial surely had its effect on Bryant, and by the end of the season he was exhausted. But the trial wasn't the only thing to bring the Lakers down. A simmering feud between Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal boiled over into a war of words in the press. Veteran players such as Karl Malone and Horace Grant were injured in crucial times of the season. But the biggest factor, according to Jackson, was the Lakers, despite winning four NBA championships in five years, had no team identity. What they had were individuals who were unwilling or unable to adapt to a team system of play.<br /><br />\\"In the 1960s and '70s, players asked: Where do I fit in? How can I help this team win?\\" writes Jackson. \\"Now they ask: How do I get what I want? Given this selfish mind-set, it is remarkable, actually, that teams play with any cohesiveness.\\"<br /><br />When you read a book about a sports team you usually read about a team that overcomes serious obstacles by relying on each other to win. Jackson, a man accustomed to winning, writes about losing. But The Last Season is more than about a game and not taking home another trophy. It's a poignant, revealing study of a team searching for its soul. And that makes it a great story.	2005-07-02

The only feature that seems to be of interest to her friends and relatives is her unwillingness or inability to enter into a romantic relationship. However, that situation changes when she meets the mysterious Bill, who seems like a perfect catch for her - apart from the fact that he is a vampire.<br /><br />In this world, vampires have re-entered normal society, although their status in quasi-legal and uncertain - indeed. There seem to be numerous people out to exploit them, either by draining and stealing their blood or else using their supernatural powers for their own ends. These problems afflict Bill too and he must spend his time fighting against these exploiters and more dangerous foes. The vulnerability he faces in trying to integrate into society means he must keep a number of his practices secret: in this sense then, we may read the novel as a partly allegorical treatment of intercultural relationships, although this idea is only very slightly explored. The ability of Sookie to endure a series of grueling physical and mental adventures is also a little difficult to accept, but we are at least spared from Anne Rice-style agonizing and angst.<br /><br />One of the pleasures of a vampire novel is in the extent to which the author will claim that well-known people are really vampires - here we are tantalized by the thought that, on his death-bed (or death-toilet), a man, known as The King, has been restored to life by the dark embrace. This novel is set in the southern states of the USA and there is a nice sense of time and place, with relationships among the major characters defined according to (or at least influenced by) this context. On the whole, the book is well-enough written and represents a pleasant read for those whose imagination can extend to accepting vampires and other creatures of the night entering albeit somewhat diffidently into modern human society.modern human society. <br /> <br />	2005-07-02

The intensity of evil here portrayed can be overpowering; the reader may need to decompress every few chapters to keep his/her heart beating regularly.<br /><br />The menace pursuing this unfortunate family is truly haunting as it unfolds page by page. Their lives are forever changed after picking up a hitchhiker in a snowstorm and they live to regret their Good Samaritan act. At least they survive; others around them are not so lucky. A human foe can be predictable to a degree; this enemy continues to surprise and shock as suspense builds. Its victims can find no firm ground, no safe place to stand against its threat as it tortures them mentally and physically. And Lebbon draws the reader into this nightmare to experience the horror with his characters.<br /><br />Indeed, the reader can find no safe place. Lebbon taps into our universal fear of the unknown, the unseen, keeping this reader looking over her shoulder to catch that slight movement of shadow glimpsed from the corner of her eye.<br /><br />FACE plumbs depths of hidden darkness inside us all.

New York is no place to raise a family. Moving to the suburbs is the best plan, but Michael would have to start a practice in competition with an established doctor who has already built a reputation. Michael needs a miracle.<br /><br />A wild dog kills Dr. Neil Farris, an elderly physician in Ashborough, New Hampshire, and Michael's boss in Manhattan, Dr. Lou Scully, has the inside track. Michael has his miracle. The Cayles move to the country and into what they believe is an uncomplicated and simple life. And to the edge of the abyss.<br /><br />During their first moments in front of their new home, Jimmy Page, the Cayles' purebred cocker spaniel, runs off into the woods, Jessica begins vomiting, Christine cries, and Michael drives a rusty nail into his foot. Philip Deighton, who lives a half mile down the road, brings back Jimmy Page and rescues the bewildered family, only to plunge them into the midst of an ancient blood pact that will destroy everything the Cayles hold dear.<br /><br />Deep in the Darkness uncovers the rot at the center of a bucolic existence. Natural curiosity, and a desire to find their place in rural New Hampshire, herds the main characters into the green shadows of an untamed wilderness reeking of bloody sacrifice and terror.<br /><br />Michael Laimo paints a surrealistic landscape where bloody trails, lit by glowing golden eyes like summer fireflies and thick with writhing maggots and gore-drunk flies, weave in and out of a pastoral scene, sending snail tracks of icy fear along your spine.	2005-07-02

Her prose is rich and multi-layered, but her characters' motivations are weak and sketchy, leaving too many questions unanswered. The climactic scene is rushed and leaves the reader unsatisfied. The idea that there is insufficient energy in the universe to support more than one immortal is ludicrous.<br /><br />Borrowed Flesh takes an interesting and promising premise and turns it into a hurried m&eacute;lange of impressions more like a fever dream, than a full-bodied horror classic.

It's a good conclusion to a good series.<br /><br />This is the third volume in the Celtic Crusades series and I would rate this one as \\"not as good as the first, but better than the second.\\" All of the books in this series are very good. The characters are well-developed, the plots are good and there are many interesting sub-plots. My only gripe is that the first two get started a little slowly, but if you hang in there for the first 50-75 pages then the action gets going well.<br /><br />The Mystic Rose does the best job of the three in grabbing your attention at the beginning and holding it. Within the first few pages an event happens that sets the tone for the rest of the book. The heroine, Caitriona sets off on a quest to avenge her father's murder and capture Christendom's most sacred relic. In fact, capturing Christendom's most sacred relic is integral to her plan for revenge. This sets up a dicey moral dilemma that is resolved nicely at the end.<br /><br />I find things like this moral dilemma to be one of Lawhead's strengths. In so much Christian fiction the heroes are cookie cutter Christians who seem to rise above all of the sins and temptations of the common man. Lawhead's heroes, and Caitriona in particular are very earthy, and very sinful people. The upshot of this is that he tells a story that leads one to believe that God, in his mercy, is the real hero of the story, not the protagonist of the book.<br /><br />At the end of this story, Caitriona is less conquerer and more conquered by the love and mercy of God. This is a very gospel based story line.<br /><br />All in all, the entire series is a worthwhile read.	2005-07-02

The new version requires medical knowledge from a drug-addled doctor who cannot escape his ghosts or himself.<br /><br />Dr. Rocky Van Slyke is head surgical resident at a Philadelphia inner city hospital where the dregs of society, medicine and the law meet and mingle. Son of a whoring mother and a military father, Rocky spins his story like a Quentin Tarantino film in short vignettes that careen dizzily at times from past to present and back again.<br /><br />Long hours, grueling studies, an opportunistic hospital lawyer, and the demons of the present and the past drive Rocky from the arms of pharmaceuticals via Vince, the hospital lawyer, and his own prescription pad into a self-created hell.<br /><br />Duck Blood Soup by Dr. Joseph Molea is Naked Lunch with a medical sensibility, clean pharmaceutical grade drugs, and a descent into oblivion without the psychedelic dreams. Dr. Molea writes from personal experience and tells a sordid tale that never raises its head from the sewers. Dark, sometimes endlessly whining, and blatantly unforgiving, Duck Blood Soup sheds a glaring operating room light on the lengths a broken soul will go to convince himself that he can climb from the depths of the pit of emotional hell and back into decency with a needle in his arm.	2005-07-02

The \\"voice\\" gradually intensifies, following family members through five generations. Both storyline and horror are subtle and elusive, in the V.C. Andrews style; the resolution leaves the reader with some unanswered questions.<br /><br />The book begins with scenes from 1894-2000, focusing on Cecelia's grandfather and his brother, her grandmother (who died after a botched abortion), possible incest, Cecelia's engagement to a gay man and later marriage to a serial cheater. The work ends with a mother who kills one of her children.<br /><br />The story, which toggles in time, has so many characters that one almost needs a written list to remember who they are and how they relate to the story. The characters fail to compel a deep interest in their welfare; indeed they don't seem deeply interested in each other. The occasional voice or spirit leading them astray could be terrifying, but becomes buried in daily detail of too many lives, thus missing the mark. This reader's emotion never rose beyond a mild curiosity about where the voice would lead each character it visits.<br /><br />A reader with delicate sensibilities may want to skip the scenes depicting the anti-war, drug, and sex-crazed '60s at their sleaziest. They add little to the plot. Nor do the early scenes further the story of Kirk, who is introduced in the '60s but is revisited later in the story.<br /><br />A promotional cover blurb labels Ms. Tem as \\"a master at conveying visceral terror\\" and proclaims her a two-time winner of the Bram Stoker Award for previous works. This is certainly true of the new work, though it may not be on par with Tem's earlier titles.<br /><br />One chilling thing about this horror novel is that it's 342 long pages long. Then again, it is titled, THE DECEIVER.	2005-07-02

This informative volume approaches healthy eating with a bit of humor, and it maps out an easy way to cook nutritious and delicious meals that children will eat. Ely lists some \\"shocking deficiencies\\" in the average diet, including that a third of children are deficient in iron, and almost half are deficient in vitamin C and zinc.<br /><br />This book is required if you have children. It has some basic food information, such as descriptions of carbohydrates, protein, and fats, along with details about the importance of drinking enough water. The author's advice is simply to eat whole, unprocessed foods and a balance of proteins and complex carbs. Ely spells out how to change one's current cooking and eating habits--starting with a pantry inventory. She also provides a helpful food glossary.<br /><br />The best part of the book, the recipe section, is full of healthy concoctions that made my mouth water. There are recipes for dishes we all love, but which usually aren't that healthy. These include meatloaf and chili, as well as delicious muffins and breads.

Julian Lloyd is seriously injured in a pre-season mini-camp and it is unlikely he will ever take the field unless something can be done.<br /><br />The four geneticists who formed Genetics Life, Incorporated (GLI) focused on breaking new ground by putting their little company in the forefront of DNA research and development, but time is running out.

Angelina Moore, co-founder of GLI, is about to change the rules of the game, but she isn't playing alone. Humanity International, (HUMINT) wants GLI and their research and they are willing to do anything.<br /><br />\\"11th Hour\\" promises a convoluted tale of intrigue, but loses its way. Bradley Warshauer spends more time on color commentary and play-by-play action than he does in developing his characters and plot. He calls the action for the Missouri Gunners and the New Orleans Saints by adding a subplot featuring an aging linebacker who doesn't want to give up the game and rest on his laurels. The story slows as Warshauer focuses on the plays and forgets the action. However, Warshauer ends his tale with a resounding crash that fizzles, leaving the reader in doubt as to the outcome of the crucial game and throwing in a love interest in the 11th hour.	2005-07-02

Along the way to achieving this dream, he finds, in Paris, the musketeers disbanded by the evil Cardinal who hopes to undermine the King's reign and rule France on his own. With the help of three famous Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, D'Artagnan fights to protect the King and his throne.<br /><br />The Three Musketeers is written with such eloquence and style that it is obvious why it has gone down in history as a distinguished novel. The sword fights are described with such magic that you feel you are standing with Athos and Porthos to fight the Cardinal's guards.<br /><br />As a hopeless romantic, I am always looking for a great romance. So if there is one negative, it would be the love story. I don't want to give away the ending. But as an avid reader of Jane Austen, if the lovers don't end up happy and together, I finish the book feeling unfulfilled. Dumas does, however, compensate with the wonderful relationship of the band of musketeers. Even though in the end they follow their own paths, you know they will always be able to rely on each other.<br /><br />In all other regards, The Three Musketeers is excellent. It leaves you exhilarated and reminds you that true friends come together in troubled times.	2005-06-12

This was a wonderful classic written by the magnificent author Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote a book that truly captivated the power of human love. He showed us that life can be very difficult, and you have to work very hard in order for you to succeed.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book, a character named Pip lived on a forge near some marshes in England. His family was generally poor. He lived with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Joe was a fairly poor blacksmith. One day, Pip was walking on the marshes. Suddenly, a strange man came up to Pip and threatened him. The strange man was a convict who was put to die on the marshes. He was handcuffed and chained. He told Pip that he would kill him if he didn't bring him a steel file and something to eat. Pip then ran back to the forge and brought the convict a steel file and some food. This vivid occurrence haunted Pip for the rest of his life.<br /><br />After the incident on the marshes, Pip met a lady named Miss Havesham. Miss Havesham was a very weird lady. She always wore her wedding dress in her house. She never left her house. Miss Havesham had a very beautiful adopted daughter named Estella. She was an arrogant woman. While looking at her, Pip fell in love with Estella.<br /><br />One day, a mysterious man came to Joe's forge. This man was sent by a secret benefactor who was residing in London. The man didn't give his name. He told Pip and Joe that someone in London was requesting him. The secret benefactor wanted Pip to come to London so that he could become a gentleman. Pip was very excited when he heard that he could work in London. Pip and Joe agreed upon the proposal. Later in that same week, Pip left Joe's forge to travel to London. There he could be a gentleman with a bright and bold future.<br /><br />While in London, Pip encountered many strange mysteries. Pip finally met his secret benefactor. Read the book to find out who the secret benefactor was...<br /><br />Overall, Great Expectations was an outstanding book. It really captivated the vast stretches of life. Great Expectations really made me feel quite sad. I felt very sorry for Pip. He had a very difficult life. He had change his personality forever once he became a gentleman. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading classics. I have read other excellent books by the wonderful author Charles Dickens. I have read Oliver Twist and The Christmas Carol.

Gregory Maguire tells her story, in Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. Author of Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, Maguire seems to revel in turning our beloved fairy tales upside down, and having us rethink our cherished notions of absolute good and evil. The Wicked Witch wasn't born a witch, nor wicked. In Maguire's delightful telling, we learn of Glinda's obsession with status and fashion, the Wizard's inhumanity, and the friendships, loves, and lost loves of little green Elphalba, the story's moral center, who is ultimately destroyed by innocent Dorothy. This tale is more real, and more like life as we know and experience it, than the original. There's always a different side to a story, and in the case of Oz, this is it. A great read from start to finish. I could not put it down.	2005-06-01

She never races through a tale, but takes her time, dissecting every nuance in delicious detail. The book's central character is Delphine, whom we meet as she is returning home to Argus, North Dakota in the early 1930s with her balancing act partner Cyprian to care for her father, the town drunk. Delphine is a survivalist - a hard working, tough love, feet-firmly-planted-on-the-ground woman. She befriends Eva, the wife of the local butcher, Fidelis Waldvogel, who had immigrated to Argus from Germany after the first world war. Fidelis starts a singing club, the members of which make up many of the contributing characters of the story.<br /><br />I had expected that the book would be about Fidelis, as the title had suggested \\"The Master Butcher\\". And it is, in that all of the stories and subplots relate to Fidelis and his family. But the novel really centers around Delphine and her struggles to survive and to help the people she loves. The novel is rich with subplots involving the various residents of Argus - Clarisse, the town mortician, Hawk, the love-struck sheriff, Step-and-a-half, the town rag collector, Tanta, Fidelis's spiteful spinster sister, and others. At times the novel reminded me of Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg Ohio, with its bizarre midwestern characters all not-so-loosely connected.<br /><br />I've read some other reviews of The Master Butchers Singing Club that didn't like the wandering subplots. I for one found the novel deeply satisfying. Erdrich writes simply and well. She paints vivid scenes that become etched in one's mind. I can see Tanta in her shiny silver suit, striding forcefully through the town looking for a job. I can see Delphine's father's house so layered with garbage, vomit, and piss that it takes months to clean out. I see Step-and-a-half's notions shop with the brand new sewing machine in the corner. Sometimes Erdrich lingers too long with the inner thoughts of some of the characters. My reaction when that happens is, this is a woman writing. Men don't write this way. I don't think my father would have the patience for this book. But my mother would love it.<br /><br />In the end, The Master Butchers Singing Club is about love, loyalty, tragedy, and redemption. It is about how small actions of good will can change the course of lives. I highly recommend it.es Erdrich lingers too long with the inner thoughts of some of the characters.

Young Tomasu is rescued from a massacre of his village by Lord Otori Shigeru who gives him the name \\"Takeo\\" and adopts him into the Otori family. Takeo's village is destroyed by the evil warlord Iida because the villagers are members of a secret, peaceful Christian-like sect. Otori Shigeru, Iida's sworn enemy, discovers powerful ninja-like talents in young Takeo and together they plan to take revenge on Iida. Meanwhile, beautiful Shirakawa Kaede is held hostage by another warlord, an ally of Iida's. Betrothed to Otori Shigeru as a pretense for Iida to lure Shigeru into his castle, Kaede and Takeo meet and fall in love.<br /><br />Thus begins the Tales of the Otori - Harlequin romance novel meets Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, with a little Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon thrown in. Apart from some graphic sex and the ongoing violence, this series would be perfect for the teen market. It is a classic tale of heros and heroines, overcoming all odds to rescue the world from evil and to find true love. The writing is fluid, well paced, and beautifully descriptive of the Japanese landscape and customs. As a 20 year practitioner of a Japanese martial art, and someone who lived in Japan for a year, I loved every word. There is a famous castle in Kyoto that has a \\"nightingale floor\\" around the living quarters. It chirps with every step someone makes; it was designed to warn the Shogun of an assassination attempt. As with the nightingale floor, many details of unique Japanese customs are delightfully woven into the story. If I can mention one shortfall of the books it is that they tend to teeter on the overly melodramatic. Our hero Takeo is no hyper macho samurai, but often filled with self-doubt. The book is obviously written by a woman (Lian Hearn is a pseudonym) and I suspect that more girls will like it than boys. That said, if you can bear through the melodramatic parts, and some slooooow tea serving scenes, there's quite enough action to keep most people glued to the story.n bear through the melodramatic parts, and some slooooow tea serving scenes, there's quite enough action to keep most people glued to the story. <br /> <br />	2005-06-01

Written in the '80s(?), it remains one of my favorites.<br /><br />A mild mannered insurance agent is sedately approaching middle age, living out his comfortable life in a small No. Carolina town. He receives news that his vagabond father has passed away, but to receive his inheritance he has to track down his father's trumpet, last seen in the possession of a young, attractive black woman who may or may not have been his father's mistress.<br /><br />The hero rounds up his S. Panza-like sidekick and off they go on a madcap quest across the South. After many hilarious adventures they also absorb a few life lessons.

Christopher counts forward in prime numbers, can't tolerate the colors yellow or brown, avoids strangers, is easily overwhelmed by noise or crowds, and always tells the truth.<br /><br />We don't often get a glimpse into the minds and worlds of people so different from ourselves. Author Mark Haddon takes us on a touching journey of how this boy's world unravels and comes together again as he bumps up against the very real human failings of those closest to him. We feel his anguish and also the comfort he finds in his world of abstract problem solving. The book has several mind-stumping math problems, that Christopher delights in solving for us. One in particular, the Monty Hall problem, was really annoying. It's the kind of problem that makes you sit down, take out a pen and paper and try to make sense of it. But you can't. Or most people can't. I think that is part of the interesting charm of this book. We the readers are as closed off to the world which Christopher inhabits, as he is to our world. As smart as I was in math, these problems confused me, made my brain hurt. As brilliant as Christopher is, it takes every ounce of his mental focus to take a simple subway ride.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-06-01

After the funeral of his parents who die in a car accident, Smithy finds an unopened letter to his parents from a mortuary in California. The letter says that the mortuary is holding the body of Smithy's sister Bethany, an indigent whose identity they've been able to match with dental records. Still in a drunken fog, Smithy finds his old Raleigh bike in their garage, and sets off down the road, flat tires as all. Thus he unintentially sets off on a bike journey across the country and in the process comes to terms with his life and the loss of his beautiful sister who couldn't escape the voices in her head.<br /><br />I downloaded The Memory of Running from Audible.com based on the hundreds of positive ratings readers gave it. For the first several hours of listening, I didn't like it at all. Here were the ramblings of a pathetic, do-nothing loser. Where was this story going? But gradually, it wore on me. As Smithy sobered up his story drew me in. Smithy had let himself go to pot, so to speak, and as his story unravels we learn that he is basically a simple, moral person. Author Ron McLarty notes in the audiobook's afterword that Smithy's one gift is that of the ability to listen. It's through this gift that we meet many people on Smithson's journey and are touched by their unique stories as well.<br /><br />The Memory of Running is meant to be heard, not read. Author Ron McLarty is professional actor, playwright, and narrator and does a terrific job narrating this story. I've read some reviews criticizing some of the writing in the book and I think I would be more critical too, if I had read it rather than listened to it. As it is told in the first person, the book is written how Smithy thinks; sometimes he's not all together coherent. He's not particularly articulate. He's a regular Joe, and critics aside, most people aren't English majors. The book requires surrendering to the character. It requires patience to hear out the story.

The training takes place at a distant Battle School in space where the young and brilliant Ender is repeatedly pushed to his limits to mold him into what he is needed to be, to become the next commander and win the war against the invaders.<br /><br />I've read Ender's Game 5 or 6 times in the last 15 years, and recently listened to the audiobook. I honestly think that Ender's Game is the best piece of science fiction I have ever read. Card is unusual as a science fiction writer in that he delves deeply into the psychology of his main characters and their complex inter-relationships. Nothing is as black and white as it may seem. There is goodness and honor in Ender's enemies as well as a willingness to manipulate and kill in Ender. Ender is constantly faced with hard choices upon which his survival and the fate of the planet depend.<br /><br />An important subplot takes place on earth between Ender's good sister Valentine and his sociopathic brother Peter, also young children. The two equally brilliant siblings take advantage of the anonymity of the net to pose as adults and publish opposing politcal articles, building strong followings and ultimately influencing the shape of world government. What is remarkable is that Card first published Ender's Game as a short story in 1985, well before the Internet became publicly available. In fact, the vision of the Net that Card lays out in Ender's game is just now beginning to be realized, some 20 years later. That two people could move nations by their writings on the web is plausible, whereas when this book was written it was still very much a fantasy. Card related in an interview that he had played around with an early version of Delphi and was inspired by the possibilities he saw.<br /><br />The first time I read this book it was for a management class on leadership and training - how to provide an environment where people around you could grow professionally. I found most of the book brutal to read, especially the first chapter in which Ender is being tormented by his brother. The cruelty, ambition, win-at-any-cost world portrayed was not (and is not) the world I wanted to see. Yet it is against this stark background that Ender and Valentine's moral centers shine. So perhaps it is an effective narrative device needed to create the core conflict of the story. Without conflict, we would all sit around, smile, and drink tea; there would be no story to tell. Ender's trials at the Battle School are riveting and once I made it that far into the book I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />In the last chapter of Ender's Game the entire premise of the book is shaken and we are set up for the next stage of Ender's Life in the sequel, Speaker for the Dead. The Ender Wiggin series is actually five books, with Ender's Game representing maybe 5% of the total, more like a prologue. The whole series is fantastic. In this world there is so much room for story and character development that Card writes a completely different version of the events of Ender's Game from the perspective of one of the other characters in Ender's Shadow and its sequel Shadow of the Hegemon.<br /><br />If you are considering the audiobook, I highly recommend it. It is unabridged and several voices are effectively used for the characters and narration.<br /><br />Look for the movie Ender's Game to come out in the next few years; there's one in the works.

In The Light Ages, an alternative vision of history unfolds, starting perhaps a few hundred years ago. Author Ian MacLeod introduces his main character Robert Burrows at the closing of the third century of this age of aether. Society doesn't really progress much as those with power and wealth, secure in their position, live off the labors of the workers who mine the magical aether, and suffer its effects. Innovation is stifled, as it really isn't needed, as long as there is a supply of aether to keep the machines running. Problems arise when the aether begins to run out...<br /><br />I had the hardest time getting into this book. The first chapter left me puzzled, with little motivation to go on. My mother recommended it however, and although she has what I consider terrible taste in television programs (she'll watch anything), she has a good eye for fantasy and science fiction. So a month after first picking it up, I tried again. Like the protagonist, the reader is initially muddled and confused by the society in which Borrows finds himself, and the events that unfold. Gradually, more and more of the mystery is revealed, and the connections between disparate people, places, and events all come into focus. MacLeod is an excellent writer, and now that I understand what the story is about, I'm re-reading the book just to enjoy the writing. I don't think the book actually did that well. And if that's the case, that's really too bad; this is a much better fantasy book than most. It is ultimately a pessimistic story, one of revolution and hope, resulting in a new society only slightly better packaged than the old one. It is a caution to anyone who thinks there is some great technological panacea out there, a powerful energetic source that can solve all the world's social ills.solve all the world's social ills.	2005-06-01

As my first introduction to science fiction, I devoured it. The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature sums up the story well:<br /><br />Juvenile novel by Madeleine L'Engle, published in 1962. It won a Newbery Medal in 1963. Combining theology, fantasy, and science, it is the story of travel through space and time to battle a cosmic evil. With their neighbor Calvin O'Keefe, young Meg Murry and her brother Charles Wallace embark on a cosmic journey to find their lost father, a scientist studying time travel. Assisted by three eccentric women--Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which--the children travel to the planet Camazotz where they encounter a repressed society controlled by IT, a disembodied brain that represents evil. Among the themes of the work are the dangers of unthinking conformity and scientific irresponsibility and the saving power of love.<br /><br />Two images remain with me after 30 years since reading the book. One is Meg saying the multiplication tables to focus her mind and resist being taken over by IT. The other is Meg calling out her love to Charles Wallace to pull him back from the IT's mind control. At the time, and still now, I was struck by the power of love in this story, which I think was Ms. Engle's primary point. Disney just ran a made-for-TV movie on A Wrinkle in Time. It started out well. I think the three kids were well cast, especially Charles Wallace. But unfortunately the special effects were way too cheesy, almost Dr. Who-ish, and detracted from rather than providing support for the story. Too bad. Disney blew it. This book deserved better.	2005-06-01

Unfortunately for Artemis, he picks the wrong fairy to kidnap - Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon (Lower Elements Police Reconnaisance) Unit. When Holly's comrades come to rescue her, things don't exactly meet up with Artemis' plans, or theirs.<br /><br />I had little choice.

Well, it pays to have friends who know you well. These books by author Eoin Colfer are a hoot! Colfer describes his book as \\"Die Hard with fairies.\\" Yep, that sums it up pretty well. Sort of like James Bond, Encyclopedia Brown, and Grimms all rolled up in one. Highly entertaining. Artemis Fowl is the first in an ongoing series. In Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident Artemis teams up with Holly and the LEP to save his father from the Russian \\"Mafiya\\" and fight off a goblin rebellion.

In Jonathan Safran's Extremely Loud, Incredibly Close we are introduced to 9 year old Oskar Schell, a highly intelligent, inventive, precocious boy coming to grips with the loss of his father who died when the World Trade Center collapsed on 9-11. Oskar discovers a mysterious key in his father's closet with the word \\"Black\\" written on the envelope that holds the key. He decides to interview every person in NYC's five boroughs with the last name of Black, and sets off every weekend, on foot to find them. At the same time a parallel story is unfolding with Oskar's grandparents, their diary entries and letters that help them come to terms with their own fractured lives, having lived through the bombing in Dresden.<br /><br />Extremely Loud, Incredibly Close is wildly creative. It reminded me at the beginning of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. But Extremely Loud is much richer, and the characters' lives in more need of repair. There is a parallel too, in the Twin Towers and the destruction of Dresden, two generations apart. This book is sad and wonderful, funny and despairing, and vibrantly alive.

I had heard of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, aka H2G2, but hadn't read it. What I had heard was that it was very funny - Monty Pythonesque humor applied to sci fi. Wanting to get a rise out of Douglas, I made him some tea and served it in a ceramic mug from Japan with a little ceramic frog hiding in the bottom of the cup. Douglas sipped his tea coolly, and when the frog emerged from the depths of the tea Douglas gave a little startled grunt, caught my eye and laughed, and continued to drink his tea. As I expected, unflappable.<br /><br />Now years later, and three years after Douglas' untimely passing, I am finally enjoying what brought Douglas his initial fame. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first book in a five book trilogy in which our unsuspecting hero Arthur Dent narrowly escapes the Earth seconds before it is demolished to make way for an interstellar highway. Arthur escapes with his colleague Ford Prefect, who reveals to Arthur that he is actually from another planet and was working on a guidebook to the galaxy before getting stranded on Earth. Catching a lift with the cooking crew of the Vogon ship that destroyed Earth, Arthur and Ford are subjected to the torture of Vogon poetry before being ejected into space, only to be picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the galaxy's BMOC, with his Heart of Gold improbability spaceship.<br /><br />Thus starts the string of ever more unlikely events in this romp through astrophysics and the hilarious imaginings of Douglas Adams' mind. Adams is a master storyteller, rarely letting his readers rest before hitting them with another plot twist or belly-acher. His humor is quintessentially British. One could easily imagine a young John Cleese in the role of Arthur Dent, deadpanning his way through the most absurd of events. Even if you have never read or enjoyed science fiction in your life, if you have any sliver of a sense of humor, you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />Since the combination of a lot of driving, an iPod purchase, and a subscription to audible.com, I've started to listen to more books than I actually read. The Hitchhiker's Guide is one of those books, read outloud and with great fourish by the author himself, Douglas Adams. As I understand it (someone correct me if I'm wrong) H2G2 was originally broadcast by radio. Thus it is ideally suited to be listened to as an audiobook. Adams has perfect comic timing in his delivery, though the book moves so quickly and covers so many diversions and plot twists I may want to listen to it again just to make sure I catch everything.<br /><br />The next book in the H2G2 5 part trilogy is The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.

In The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios Martel digs into his early works and presents us with four short stories, written before the Life of Pi. Of the four stories, the first two were for me the most memorable. The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios is a story of a young man helping his college friend as he struggles with and ultimately succumbs to AIDS. The two men meet often over several months and collaboratively create a story, whose narrative line loosely follows the major events of the 20th century, starting with 1901.<br /><br />The second story, The Time I Heard the Private Donald J. Rankin String Concerto with One Discordant Violin, by the American Composer John Morton, is about a man's chance encounter with the extraordinary music of an unknown composer, a Vietnam vet who works the night shift at a bank as a janitor. Both stories demonstrate Martel's skill with prose and gift as a storyteller.<br /><br />Martel's author's note in the beginning of the book is worth a read. In it he details his years of failed attempts at writing. I have a writer friend who once told me that in order to be a good writer, one must be willing to be a bad writer. Clearly this is what happened with Martel. Thank goodness he had parents who didn't push him into being something he wasn't, but supported him even when he wasn't producing results. Martel spent much of his early years learning and exploring, building the palette of experiences he could draw upon for his fiction.<br /><br />If you loved Life of Pi, you will very likely enjoy this small collection of stories.	2005-05-31

Among the oddities revealed by its writers are that average derives from an Old French word meaning \\"damage to shipping\\", that caprice comes by a devious route from an old Italian word for a hedgehog, that in medieval times deer was the name for any creature, that in Middle English dinner could mean breakfast, that fawn and fetus are etymologically connected, that garage is from a French word whose first sense in that language was a place where one moors one's boat, that junk originally meant old rope ... and so on.

They decide to return to The Land and attempt to extinguish the Banefire hoping that this will slow the desecration of the Sunbane. The minions of Lord Foul are poised to oppose them every step of the way. They also know that even if they slow down the Sunbane, they still must eventually find a way to stop Lord Foul himself.<br /><br />Donaldson brings the trilogy to a brilliant conclusion in this volume. Linden finally comes to terms with the \\"ghosts\\" of her past and realizes that she is not inherently evil despite having made mistakes in the past. Covenant achieves an inner peace after he finally accepts what he must do to defeat Lord Foul. The triumph of two flawed human beings over the \\"devil incarnate\\" provides an interesting premise for Donaldson to explore the frailties of human nature. I finally began to like Covenant in this volume and I actually began to empathize with him.

Three thousand years have passed since Covenant was last in The Land. But all the beauty and healthful benefits of The Land are gone. Lord Foul has warped The Land to his will through the use of the Sunbane, an evil aura around the sun that bends the laws of nature. The people of The Land must scratch out a meager existence and use human blood in an attempt to control the Sunbane.

Although not suffering from leprosy, Linden has demons of her own from her past that she must come to terms with in order to assist Covenant in the redemption of The Land.<br /><br />Covenant decides to journey to Revelstone, the former Lords' keep, to determine if the Clave, strange governing body that manipulates the Sunbane, is acting for the good of the people. Can Covenant find a way to reverse the effects of the Sunbane? Can he face and defeat Lord Foul once again? Can Linden come to terms with the ghosts of her past and find a way to assist Covenant? This and the other two books in the trilogy will answer these questions.<br /><br />Donaldson is once again masterful without repeating the story line of the first trilogy. The Land is completely different (yet strangely the same) in this trilogy, which opens numerous new possibilities. As in the first trilogy, much of the book is used to explore the frailties of the main characters and how they mirror the basic frailties of human nature. Donaldson triumphs once again. If you liked the first trilogy, this one won't disappoint you. While not superior to the original trilogy, this is every bit its equal.d find a way to assist Covenant?

Covenant decides the best course of action is to leave The Land to search for the Isle of the One Tree. Centuries before, Berek Halfhand had forged the Staff of Law from a branch of the One Tree. Covenant feels the only hope of redemption for The Land is to forge a new staff and restore the laws of nature that were broken when the original staff was destroyed. Accompanied by Linden Avery and a ship full of giants they depart The Land. Since no one knows where the One Tree is located, the giants suggest that the company seek the help of the Elohim. The Elohim are a fairy people that appear to be earthpower incarnate. But the Elohim have their own plans for Covenant and the white gold.<br /><br />A great deal of this book explores the character of Linden Avery. She has terrible secrets in her past that she must explore and confront to overcome her feelings of helplessness. Her confrontation with the leader of the Clave in The Wounded Land left her doubting herself and feeling that she is inherently evil. She must work through her feelings and find a way to help Covenant on his quest to redeem The Land. The giants are all terrific characters, which add to the enjoyment of this book. There is a great deal of action in this book, which flows exceptionally well and never drags.	2005-05-23

He is very good at his chosen job, and is very advanced for his age. His hate for a young magician of considerable power when he embarasses Nat at a large party forces nat to desperate measures. He steals a magical artifact worth an enormouse sum of money from his enemy's house by the means of a Djin, Bartimaeus, that he has summoned from the other world. Bartimaeus is a high level djin who has an attitude worse than a teenager's!! Nathaniel also learns to hate his master for thinking him a stupid boy and for not recognizing his amazing talents. When Nat finds out about a plan that has been hattched by his enimies to overthrow the prime minister of England, where the book is set, he begins to realize what he has caught himself up in, and to realize that he will have to take a lot of responsibility to fix what he has done. Written from that alternating points of veiw of Nathaniel and Bartimaeus this book is very tense and funny, read it to find out more...<br /><br />I thought that this book was an amazing piece of literature, and that it deserves praise from all who read it. This book kept me on my toes, and I laughed, went quiet, and shouted out loud as the characters made mistakes, and found out huge secrets. I would recommend this book to fans of Eragon, LOTR, Harry Potter, and SUE. It is not tragic like SUE, but i think that Bartimaeus's point of veiw will appeal to the sense of humor of SUE's fans. This book is good for people aged 10-14, but would also be good for younger or older readers (I hate when I love a book that is meant for people older or younger than me, so this book is good for everyone!)	2005-05-22

It is told from the viewpoint of a woman who comes to know first one heir to Avonar, and then another.  The world exists, you see, in this realm and another.  A magical barrier separates ordinary men from where sorcerers originated, a barrier connected by a magical and hard to find bridge.  [Note the series title--The Bridge of D'Arnath.]<br /><br />Our heroine is Lady Seriana (Seri, for short), and she is sister to a duke, bound for marriage to the next king.  But Seri refuses marriage to Evard, turning down a chance to be queen because she has fallen in love with a sorcerer.  Now, sorcerers are rare in Leiran because they are feared and hated.  Karon is one of the last sorcerers alive on this side of the barrier.  He is a gifted healer, so gifted in fact that his patients accidentally give him away to his enemies.  Though he tries to hide behind another profession, a sheriff traps Seri and Karon in front of the king.  The sheriff stabs Seri in the back, in the heart, and Karon must save his beloved wife or watch her die.  He is taken prisoner for sorcery and tortured.  All of Karon's friends are murdered for having known his secret without telling the crown.  Seri is held prisoner, but because she is a duke's sister, she looses only her station, her husband, and her child, but not her life.<br /><br />Seri runs away to live in the country.  Dirt poor, ten years later when a stranger needs her help, she has little left to give.  But this young man is very strange.  He is running from those who seek his life.  He is mute, and naked.  And Seri discovers that he has no memory of who he even is.  When Seri sees him do magic, she is compelled to solve a mystery more dangerous than her experiences ten years prior.<br /><br />This young man is also a son of Avonar, except his Avonar is on the other side (there are two cities called Avonar, one on each side of the magical barrier).  Prince D'Natheil, Heir to the royal line of D'Arnath, has crossed over, come to ask assistance from those of his kind on this side of the barrier without having known that they were nearly extinct.  But the mystery goes deeper than that.  Seri feels drawn to this man . . . almost as if she has always known him.<br /><br />The book is presented in a flip-flop fashion.  It begins in the middle then constantly flash-backs to fill in the back-story.  Though it does have enough action to keep it moving, these flash-backs get a bit irritating.  So, this reader only votes SON OF AVONAR a five out of ten, because -1- of the heavy use of flash-backs; and -2- because the prose, though very well done, gets a bit too wordy at times; and because -3- the ending did not satisfy [Note: the ending will probably satisfy you if you fit the description in the first paragraph of this review.  However, the story led this reader to anticipate romance, an anticipation that was not rewarded.  One might suspect that Carol Berg could use this carrot to lead her readers through the series without ever allowing them to become fully satisfied.]  This book is for readers who want a heroine who will save the day with her smarts.ten years prior.   <br />  <br />This young man is also a son of Avonar, except his Avonar is on the other side (there are two cities called Avonar, one on each side of the magical barrier).

Instead, the Generals of the conquering armies rule over the captured lands. The Roman leadership understands the need for a single Caesar with dictatorial authority to establish order so that the center holds.<br /><br />The current prime competitors for the job are Generals Marius and Sulla, both successful with their annexation campaigns. The Senate vacillates and civil war breaks out between the two legions with Sulla forcing Marius to retreat. However, Sulla returns to Greece to put down a rebellion, which allows Marius to triumphantly enter Rome and order the Senate to do his bidding. Watching his Uncle Marius' stratagem is his nephew Gaius who learns one key lesson to trust nobody, even though he allows his beloved childhood best buddy to remain close to him.<br /><br />Though anachronisms even noticed by this Shakespearean-based Ancient Roman buff will upset the purists, historical fiction readers will enjoy this deep look at Rome just before the rise of Julius Caesar. The thrilling story line is loaded with a feel for the Marius-Sulla rivalry and contains an intriguing spin (at least for us tyros) that sets the stage for the next volume. The audience obtains a robust look at key real life persons in their environs several of who could have served as role models for Machiavelli. Genre fans will take much delight with EMPEROR THE GATES OF ROME even those who knew before the climax the final turn of the chariot as Conn Igguldon spins a deep enthralling depiction.	2005-05-22

Stephanie Plum is at it again, in this eighth book by author Janet Evanovich. Hard Eight, continues the adventures of the wanna-be-intrepid bounty hunter Plum tries to find seven-year-old Annie Solder and her mother, Evelyn, who have disappeared. Evelyn's estranged husband, Steven is the shady owner of a dive bar, and he, too, is looking for his ex-wife and daughter, but they aren't the only ones.<br /><br />Plum takes on the case as a favor to her mother's neighbor, a woman she grew up living next door to, but whom she has few ties. Finding a missing child is hardly work for a Fugitive Apprehension Agent, but Stephanie feels obligated, as she learns that a child custody bond was signed by Annie's grandmother, and if the child and her mother are not recovered, she could lose her house.<br /><br />As she digs deeper into the case she discovers that, as always, somebody is angry at Stephanie Plum and wants her to disappear-for good. This book's villain is nastier than most, as he will stop at nothing to get what he wants from Evelyn and Annie. The only problem is, Plum has no idea what that might be, despite the fact he is convinced she knows.<br /><br />With her life on the line, Plum searches for the elusive Evelyn, and is forced to join up with the mysterious and sexy Ranger, who scares her to death because she is so attracted to him. She also needs the help of her on-again, off-again fianc&eacute; Trenton cop Joe Morelli. Tagging along with Stephanie is the irrepressible Lula, a former prostitute turned file clerk who fancies herself a bounty hunter, and a new sidekick, Evelyn's lawyer/Laundromat manager, who resembles the Pillsbury Doughboy.<br /><br />Evanovich has done it again, creating incredibly real characters, including the two sexy men who are vying for Stephanie's attention. You don't know which one to root for, which says volumes for Evanovich's writing ability. As usual, the humor is sharp and funny, in particular a scene where the hapless Plum is attacked by a gaggle of geese who want her Crackerjacks.<br /><br />Whether bemoaning her bad hair days, or losing her fourth set of handcuffs in a week, Plum manages to keep plugging along and keep the reader veering between horror and humor.<br /><br />I highly recommend Hard Eight, and encourage anyone who has not read the Stephanie Plum novels before to go back and start at the beginning.

For fans familiar with the storyline, Skyfall tells the tale of how Roca meets Eldrinson [have you ever wondered how improbable that meeting must have been?].  For those of you unfamiliar with The Skolian Empire Saga, this is not a bad place to start.  Way into our future, the story goes, humanity reaches the stars only to discover that we are already there.  Supposedly, a very long time ago, some ancient race took a sampling of humans from Earth then seeded them elsewhere, then disappeared, leaving humans stranded and having to grow their own societies independent of outside aid.  One of these cultures now calls itself the Skolian Empire.  Though they are ruled by an Assembly, the strength of that Assembly is in Skolian royalty.  Ruby Dynasty psions have strong psychic powers.  They run an unmatched and instantaneous interplanetary communications system (the Kyle Web) that keeps their empire strong.  The problem is there are very few Ruby psions and breeding them is a challenge for even the greatest geneticists.<br /><br />Roca is the daughter of Lahaylia Selei (Ruby Pharaoh) and Imperator Jarac [Skolian Empire fans know her as the mother of Soz, Kelric, and others].  Being that Roca is an Imperial princess who travels the stars the way we travel the highways, one can only wonder how it was she ever met a quiet man from the backworld planet of Lyshriol [Eldrinson calls the place Lyshriol, but prior to inclusion in the greater galactic society, outsiders just called that weigh-station Skyfall].  And so in this book we have the romantic meeting of two Rhon minds [one is reminded of the fireworks between Sauscony and Jabriol in PRIMARY INVERSION].<br /><br />So--just how do Roca and Eldrinson meet?  Serendipitously, of course.  Roca's grown son Kurj from her first marriage wants to go to war with their enemy the Trader Aristos--it's the age-old tale of territorial dispute--but he doesn't hold enough votes to the Assembly to sway the decision in his favor . . . but his mother does.  Only problem: Roca will vote against going to war.  Now Kurj loves his mother but he does want her where she can't cast those votes.  Roca doesn't catch on soon enough, and when she does, events fall against her getting back to the Assembly in time to keep Kurj from using her votes supposedly in her name.  In her rush to get back, Roca covers her trail from Kurj's Imperial security and takes a little known route.  Then more events fall against her, trapping her on Skyfall/Lyshriol for many months.  By the time Kurj finally tracks her down, more events have been set in motion (love, for instance) and Roca has another battle ahead of her with the Assembly and her family: that of getting them to accept the fact that she wants to be married to a nobody (who is also a lost link to the ancient Ruby dynasty).<br /><br />This is a nice love story with intriguing twists and action.  Though classed as romantic science-fiction, neither the romance nor the science-fiction are over-played.  It's a simple tale and an easy read.  I recommend it most for Skolian Empire fans who like to get the entire story about the Ruby Dynasty.  For pure entertainment, however, I think Asaro's PRIMARY INVERSION plus THE RADIANT SEAS offers more.nough votes to the Assembly to sway the decision in his favor . . . but his mother does.

They have uncovered information that indicates that the children may have been hidden from the Emperor's purge on Belsavis-a remote, frozen world. The tales they have heard indicate that a Jedi exodus emanated from the dark crypts below the planet's surface. Since that time, no one has returned from exploring those crypts.<br /><br />On the other side of the galaxy, Luke is guided by dreams created by the Force and uncovers a super-weapon left over from the Emperor's reign of terror. The automated Dreadnought Eye of Palpatine was created for a secret mission by the Emperor, but was never activated. The Eye of Palpatine is controlled by a sophisticated artificial intelligence system know as the Will. Captured and taken aboard the Dreadnought, Luke encounters the spirit of Callista, a Jedi Knight who gave her life years before to stop the ship. Now Luke must find a way to destroy the ship once and for all because the Eye has awakened and the ship is attempting to fulfill its original mission - the total annihilation of Belsavis!<br /><br />I've always associated Barbara Hambly with novels comprised of complex character development with less emphasis on plot. In this novel, plot development is paramount, although character development is not neglected. The Eye is one of the most creative super-weapons that Star Wars authors have invented. And the plot is believable and well crafted.<br /><br />The action switches smoothly between the two main plots. The book contains no \\"dead spots\\" or filler. All of the scenes move the plot along smartly. Hambly also spends more time than most other Star Wars writers on the development of Leia's character. This attention to Leia continues in her other Star Wars novel reviewed below. Some of the characters in this novel were created in previous novels, so I would recommend reading the Thrawn Trilogy and the Jedi Academy Trilogy to extract maximum enjoyment from this novel.logy to extract maximum enjoyment from this novel. <br /> <br />	2005-05-14

It has beautiful large color plates of dragons on every left-side page and amusing anecdotes on each facing page.<br /><br />The author is presuming to be an authority on \\"the discovery of dragons\\" and in a tongue-in-cheek narrative is trying to professionally prove the disclaimers of his \\"one time colleague Marty Fibblewitz\\" who has now \\"chosen to side with the doubters.\\"  THE DISCOVERY OF DRAGONS is divided into three sections of nine pages each: The Discovery of European Dragons, The Discovery of Asiatic Dragons, and The Discovery of Tropical Dragons.  The first page of each section is an introduction to the section that describes the distinctive qualities of the dragons of said region, introduces the adventurer who discovered those dragons, and throws pot-shots at 'Professor' Fibblewitz.  The following eight pages of each subsection show the author's 'proof' of these discoveries.<br /><br />European dragons, says the author, were discovered by Bjorn of Bromme, Viking, from A.D. 856 through A.D. 863.  He discovered Great Snow Dragons in Greenland, an Emerald Dragon in Ireland, a Welsh Red Dragon sleeping on a horde of treasure, and the St. George Dragon (yes, that very same dragon).  The author's proof comes in the way of letters found, scrawled penmanship on linen to his cousin Olaf back in Norway (who seems to be having his own problems Rampaging the countryside).<br /><br />In The Discovery of Asiatic Dragons, we meet heroine Soong Mei Ying, faithful daughter of a thirteenth-century Chinese Silk trader, who--while taking her ailing father's silks to a far away market--discovers a pair of Mongolian Screamers, a Japanese Butterfly Lizard with medicinal qualities, and Eastern Temple Worm, and a Great Golden Worm.<br /><br />Now, the Letters of Dr. E.F. Liebermann in The Discovery of Tropical Dragons might be just a tad funnier than those of Bjorn of Bromme (it's a close tie, actually).  Dr. Liebermann went to Africa in 1847 searching for the African Frilled Frog.  He never finds this frog, but along the way he discovers four kinds of dragon (Livingstone's Demon, the Crested Dipper, a monstrous Common Green Draak, and several deadly Spotted Marsh Draaks).  He also invents the typewriter and figures out the theory of continental drift.<br /><br />This is an adorable book!  Each section has its own style, and the characters--illuminated by their letters home--are unique individuals with great quirks.  Each page is laden with tiny details that enthralled this reader.  The letters home all have subtle changes as the adventurer passes from one discovery into the next--some of them quite hilarious.  There's footnotes and maps and scale diagrams and miniature picture story reels across the bottom of each page . . . all done in glorious and changing detail work.  But the best part are the dragon plates themselves: these large color paintings are gorgeous.

Barri Flowers' haunting, suspenseful drama The Scheme of Things sets up a web of intrigue that casts the shadow of suspicion on each character leaving the reader wondering \\"do we really know what anyone is capable of?\\" Under the guise of an upper middle class life of educated, affluent African American business people living their eclectic, privileged urbane lives in the city of Detroit, we are drawn into the deep \\"caramel ice cream complexion and liquid sable eyes\\" of a young homeless woman whom the main character, Dwayne Bradford, meets on the street one Saturday afternoon shopping with his wife of nearly 10 years. From that first enigmatic encounter, not uncommon in many of our cities, we are haunted with Dwayne by her mysterious apparitions into his world of reality.<br /><br />\\"I watched as she ran off, and felt as if Evelyn had exposed my darker side for all the world to see. Or at least, my immediate world. The side that was capable of raw sexual needs. Infidelity. Dishonesty. Obsessive jealousy. Even murder.\\"<br /><br />As her identity and presence in Dwayne's life becomes tangible, his already tense relationship with his wife, Surecka, begins to unravel as both women revolve in a circle dance as lovers of two visceral rivals - Dwayne and his blackmailing/wife-stealing coworker, Lincoln. The twists and turns of the plot as identities are ripped away like layered masks, kept this reader on the edge of his seat. Like watching a Hitchcock movie and being compelled to yell out at the character that the killer is in the room behind him, I found myself frustrated and angry with Dwayne for failing to see the slippery slope as he continually makes one bad decision of deceit after the next until he is perilously dragged into the depths of murder that he would not/could not commit but nonetheless for which he is charged and arrested. And so, the reader is thrown back into the spiral of suspense as the psycho-sexual drama becomes a \\"whodunit\\". No one is to be trusted.<br /><br />Mr. Flowers has expertly established a world and culture that while uniquely African American is refreshingly non-stereotypical. Unlike Hollywood, R. Barri does not need to reflect a subculture of drug addicts or criminals to make the characters \\"feel\\" ethnic, but a true-to-life characterization of people - whatever their ethnicity - where CEO's of multi-million dollar corporations, 6-figure executives with stay-at-home wives, police detectives, and lawyers are African American. His primary female characters are strong black \\"sistas\\" with seductive layers of intelligence, independence, strength, and boiling hot sexuality rooted in dishonesty and deception. The constant yin and yang of their expectations and desires of life contribute to the palpable conflict of good and evil that runs throughout the novel.<br /><br />Dwayne Bradford represents the quintessential modern-day tragic figure - contentedly on the \\"right\\" path to the American Dream: beautiful wife, successful career, perched to take over the firm in two years, the distant plan for children, a bigger house, etc. etc. - who risks everything, and loses. He is the sole proprietor of his misfortune and the sole proprietor of his salvation. His repressed heartbreak and regret over his dead sister who had been lost to homelessness proves to be the force that drives him in his destructive relationships with the women in his life as well as himself. He accepts the consequences of his actions and sets out in a frenzied attempt to crawl back out of the depths of depravity and regain his dignity. In rapid pace reparation, Mr. Flowers manages to knit together the fragmented plots and subplots of murder, deception, embezzlement, violence, sexual exploitation, and injustice that leaves no loose ends hanging.<br /><br />According to his biography, R. Barri Flowers \\"is the prolific author of thirty novels and nonfiction books\\". The Scheme of Things is my first read penned by Mr. Flowers, but after finishing this nail-biter, it will definitely not be my last.finishing this nail-biter, it will definitely not be my last.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-14

A satirical mock epic of almost Alexander Pope or Voltaire proportions, \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" is a lesser known, but intriguing part of Tolkien's body of work.<br /><br />Farmer Giles (of the village known as Ham in the \\"vulgar tongue\\") lives a quiet life with his wife and dog, who possesses the power of speech.

The irony is, when Giles (who came out of the trial almost as badly as the giant himself) is celebrated as a hero and reknowned in the village and beyond, the giant himself thinks that the hit of the primative gun was nought but the sting of a rather large insect.<br /><br />And so, Giles, who was the last person in the land to become a hero (very much like other Tolkien heros the likes of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins) must take out a dangerous (but delightfully polite) dragon whose fire and claws have ravaged the country for some time. This he accomplishes in a suit of poorly made chainmail, and an ancient helmet.<br /><br />As a climax, the farmer-turned-warrior must make battle with the high king of the land so that he may claim the dragon's hoard as his own, instead of trying to slake the king's thirst for wealth. With the help of this same dragon, Giles defeats the avaricious monarch and becomes a king in his own right.<br /><br />Tolkien's knowledge of Med√¶val culture and lore make this story an enchanting and amusing tale of the best and worst of humankind. He spares no one in his satire, even condemning the chivalrous knights of the king. With a smile and a pen that stings, Tokien creates here a fantasy story of the deliciously unexpected. Charming and intelligent, \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" has a light sense of wit and humor that one rarely finds in modern literature.les of Ham\\" has a light sense of wit and humor that one rarely finds in modern literature. <br /> <br />	2005-05-14

The cover artwork for this book is gorgeous. Unfortunately, the book doesn't live up to its promise. In the first book of this series, The Last Dragonlord, Bertin took the old dragon fantasies, livened them up a bit and gave them a new twist. I would have expected the sequel to expand upon some of her ideas from the previous novel. Instead, Bertin goes off on a whole new tangent, giving the book a decidedly Oriental slant.<br /><br />In Jehanglan the Emperor derives his power from the Phoenix, a magical creature wrongfully imprisoned centuries ago. In a contrived and complicated plot, it becomes apparent to the Dragonlords that a truedragon, or possibly a missing dragonlord, may also be a captive. A small group, including Linden and Maurynna, sets out to investigate. Maurynna has problems of her own, having been unable to Change since her first time. However, rather than exploring this issue in depth, Bertin focuses on the thoughts and manipulations of various characters in Jehanglan. She is perhaps at her best while concentrating on the machinations of Shei-Luin, the Emperor's concubine.<br /><br />The main problem with this novel is the quantity and quality of the various plots and subplots Bertin tries to weave together. While some of the main characters from the first book are present, Bertin also introduces a plethora of new people. Many of them bear similar Oriental-sounding names, adding to the confusion. It is very hard to see how any of these plots tie together and Bertin takes more than half the book just setting the stage. She also skips around frequently from plot to plot, making it difficult to get involved or care about the characters she writes about. In my opinion, Bertin has made a mistake typical of many new writers - she has tried to jam too many ideas into one book and is unable to do full justice to any of them. The subplots were superficial and generally leave the reader feeling unsatisfied with the results, especially since most of them remain unresolved at the end of the story. Unlike her first novel, which could have happily stood alone, it is very obvious that Bertin has a sequel planned for this one. Despite my dissatisfaction with this novel, I am not completely put off. I think Bertin has potential and will be interested to see how she handles the next installment in the series, Bard's Oath.superficial and generally leave the reader feeling unsatisfied with the results, especially since most of them remain unresolved at the end of the story.

I touched the scar on my forehead again. Sometimes monsters were called mothers.\\"<br /><br />In the voice of Private Detective Lena Jones we hear years of misery and betrayal, as she tries to recover from being shot by her mother while still a young child. Like the visible scar on her forehead, she is still scarred inside, and finds it hard to let down her barriers and live life.<br /><br />Her mother's betrayal becomes even more poignant as she enters into a secretive group of polygamists who own an entire town on the Utah/Arizona border. These mothers, too, are betraying their children. Desert Wives begins as Lena hides in the high desert, waiting for 13-year-old Rebecca, a girl she is helping to escape Purity and a forced marriage to the Church's prophet. The girl's parents were both raised in the community, but left to find a better life. They divorced when Rebecca's father returned to his polygamous roots. After he takes Rebecca back to Purity, Lena is hired by the girl's mother to help her escape.<br /><br />After aiding the girl's escape, a joyous reunion between Rebecca and her mother is destroyed as law enforcement officials from Utah arrive in Arizona and accuse Rebecca's mother of the murder of Prophet Solomon Royal-Rebecca's intended groom. Lena realizes the only way she will be able to prove her client's innocence is to somehow find her way inside the reclusive community, posing as a sister wife.<br /><br />Once inside the town of Purity she learns that woman are not valued here, except for breeding, and the secrets of the town are much deeper than anyone could ever have known. In addition, local law enforcement, with ties to polygamy through their Mormon ancestors, turns a blind eye to the treatment that women and girls receive from the men of Purity.<br /><br />Lena discovers the town is filled with felons and child abusers, and the primary source of income is the welfare collected by the sister wives and their many children. The deeper she digs, the nastier the secrets are, until she finds her own life in peril. The leadership of Purity is willing to commit murder to keep prying eyes away from their assets.<br /><br />Author Betty Webb, who lives in Arizona, is very familiar with the terrain she covers in Desert Wives.

David McCullough (of Truman fame) is one of our favorite authors, and it pains us to see him on autopilot like this. A biography should be more than a convenient arrangement of the subject's personal correspondence. Yet McCullough relies almost entirely on President Adams (quite voluminous) diaries and letters to his wife. The only supporting material seems to left over from a book on Jefferson McCullough abandoned. Read this if you want to know what being John Adams was like. Don't read it if you have any interest in gaining insight into how his life fit into the great drama of the founding of America.	2005-05-09

Murdered and Deified A.D. 54 (Vintage International)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Who wants to be a Roman Caesar?	Who wants to be a Roman Caesar? We do. At least, we would if we were interested in having sex with family members, and enjoyed the adrenalin rush one gets wondering if, this time, the food really is poisoned.<br /><br />Enter Claudius, reluctant contender for Caesar. Dribbling, lurching, but highly intelligent and misunderstood, Claudius is the focal point of the fictionalised autobiography written in 1934, by Robert Graves. Sure, it's an old book. You should read it anyway.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, it is palatable introduction to the world of the Roman Emperor, the politics, treachery and instability of men who believed themselves more than merely mortal. Take, for example, the tale of Tiberius and the fisherman.<br /><br />As the story goes, Tiberius landed on a small island to be greeted by a local fisherman, who, recognising the emperor, offered him a fish as a gift. Tiberius was intensely (and justifiably) paranoid, and believed the man was offering him an omen of death, so he ordered his guards to hold the man down and scrub his face with the fish. When the fisherman later quipped \\"I'm glad I didn't offer him a crab,\\" Tiberius ordered that he be similarly scrubbed with a crab. He went on to collect the most extensive encyclopaedia of pornography in the known world, owned a giant iguana, held orgies with his sister and died in exile at the hand of one of his soldiers, watched by future screwed-up emperor Caligula.Such anecdotes that reveal personality provide Graves fodder for conjecture: they form the bones around which Graves weaves this fascinating tale. And he is a master of the craft.<br /><br />Stylistically this is a superb novel, seamlessly moving through the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and Graves' deep understanding of the complexities of the Roman political system adds credibility to what can, at times, seem like an impossible tale. His treatment of the psychology of senator and caesar, the fear of power absolute, and the motives behind the plots and counter-plots of assassination are skilfully handled.<br /><br />Interestingly, Graves also explores the role of women in the history of the empire. Exhibit A: Livia. Wife of Augustus and matriarch of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, Livia was some piece of work. Self-serving, power hungry, frustrated by her status as a woman, she plotted, murdered and deified herself and her husband with a ruthless single-mindedness that made Gladiator's Commodus look like a boy scout.<br /><br />It is a bold for an author to masquerade as Roman royalty, and yet Graves adroitly manoeuvres through the narrative in the first person, in the guise of Claudius, who, unseen or ignored because of his disabilities, is privy to confidences denied other member of the royal household. So the plot unfolds for us, as it unfolded for him, intricate, outrageous but always moving to its inevitable conclusion -- Claudius himself becomes emperor.plots and counter-plots of assassination are skilfully handled. <br /> <br />Interestingly, Graves also explores the role of women in the history of the empire.

Sometimes, pretty far, as is revealed in the book Dangerous Attraction, by Robert Scott.<br /><br />Twenty year old Katrina Montgomery was a lovely and warm young woman who was also a very beloved member of her family. None of her family is sure why she began to hang out with the lethal street gang in Ventura, CA. called the Skin Head Dogs. It appears that Katrina felt some sort of thrill involved with \\"taking a walk on the wild side.\\"<br /><br />Katrina befriended a member of the gang, the tattooed and drug abusing Justin Merriman, who himself was also twenty years of age and was doing time for the assault of a correction's officer. Katrina and Justin spent much time writing letters back and forth to each other until the day that Justin's time had been served and he was released.<br /><br />Justin came out of prison with the impression that Katrina was his girlfriend, but that is not the way that she saw it. At a gang party on Thanksgiving of 1992, Katrina proceeded to get herself quite intoxicated and ended up at Justin's family home along with two other of the gang members. In Justin's bedroom, she was taken and raped by Justin right in front of his buddies. He then stabbed her in the neck with a knife, beat her over the head with a heavy wrench, then finally cut her throat. Her body was never found.<br /><br />It was not until six years later, when he was stopped for a bike riding violation by police and ran, that he was caught.....and even that was after a wild chase and a harrowing seven hour standoff.<br /><br />So, where does Justin's mother fit in?<br /><br />Beverlee Sue Merriman had her own ways. She did everything within her powers to protect her son, no matter what the consequences were to her. She made sure to keep in close contact with Justin's other skinhead gang buddies, to ensure that no one would \\"talk.\\" She ended up doing her son more harm than she would ever imagine.<br /><br />This case had grown cold by the time the police had finally gathered enough evidence to bring Justin to trial, where the jury concluded that he was to die by lethal injection at San Quentin Prison in California.<br /><br />This is a very well written true crime book. Robert Scott, also the author of Rope Burns and Like Father, Like Son, has done an excellent job of laying out this story which occurs over an eight year time span. Fans of true crime will find this story of murder, along with all of the terrorizing used to keep the gang members silent, to be a very interesting read.r />This case had grown cold by the time the police had finally gathered enough evidence to bring Justin to trial, where the jury concluded that he was to die by lethal injection at San Quentin Prison in California.<br /><br />This is a very well written true crime book.

Del Rey has been publishing his new works and republishing some of his old works from the 1980's. Legend is one of his early efforts and is not your run of the mill fantasy novel. It is quite engaging and one of the best novels I have read this year.<br /><br />Druss the Ax is the type of warrior that is a legend in his own time. Druss has been fighting all his life and was instrumental in turning the tide of many battles in the defense of the Drenai people. But Druss is now fighting the one battle he cannot win...he is getting old.<br /><br />Druss retired to an estate in the mountains to await old age and death. But barbarians from the north once again threaten the Drenai people. The Drenai king is weak and inept and has let his armies dwindle to an inadequate force. Now 250,000 barbarians are marching on the fortress of Dros Delnoch, which is badly undermanned. If this fortress falls, the barbarian hordes will sweep into Drenai and pillage the land. Druss reluctantly comes out of retirement to fight in one last battle to defend Dros Delnoch. Everyone says the battle is hopeless. But Druss has been in thousands of hopeless battles before. Can this hero rise to the occasion one last time to once again be the salvation of his people?<br /><br />There is very little magic and sorcery in this fantasy novel. The main focus is on the courage and strength of ordinary soldiers asked to perform an extraordinary feat. There will be no sudden magical surprises to turn the tide of battle at the end. Only pluck, grit, luck and vicious hand-to-hand combat will turn the tide of battle at Dros Delnoch. The characters Gemmell creates are earthy, tough and very believable. Prince Valiant looks like a sissy compared to Druss and his compatriots. Druss is a man you would have been proud to know and someone you would risk your life to defend. You know from the start that the good guys here are doomed (10,000 defenders vs. 250,000 barbarians), but the conclusion of the novel is as satisfying as it is unexpected.

For centuries, the fortress Torre Alta has guarded the pass separating the vast northern wilderness from the civilized southern baronies. For generations, reputation alone has been sufficient to maintain the peace. But, times change and the residents of Torre Alta find themselves in the unenviable position of having to back up their reputation with action. Barbaric hordes from the north, the Vaalakans, are descending upon the rich and cultivated lands of Belbidia and focusing all their might upon breaking through Torre Alta's defenses.<br /><br />As the novel opens, Baron Branwolf is preparing the fortress for the expected siege. Suspecting Vaalakan intruders in the labyrinths below the castle, Branwolf sends his younger half-brother, Hal, along with the search party but forbids his son, Caspar, to accompany them. Rashly, Spar defies his father and follows the group into the tunnels. When disaster separates the two boys from the group, they are forced to find their own way out. Instead, they find the Vaalakan spies and are taken captive, thus beginning a series of adventures with far-reaching consequences. Welch deftly uses many of the tools of traditional epics. Hal and Spar are both companions and rivals. Along the way they encounter friends and foes. What begins as a simple need to escape the enemy eventually becomes a long and intricate quest for the key to saving not just themselves, but Torre Alta and all of Belbidia from complete ruin. Treachery and betrayal, conflicting religious beliefs, inhuman evil and mysterious magic all play a role in this tale.<br /><br />Welch is a vivid and descriptive author.  Her characters are well drawn and finely detailed.  They are also human, showing the faults and frailties we all possess.  Welch even manages to make the enemy seem understandable at times.  This is Welch's first published novel and it is quite good.  It has some weak spots, but they did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the novel.  However, it is important to remember that this is just the first installment in the trilogy.  If you're looking for closure, you won't find it with this book.  While some loose ends are wrapped up, most matters aren't truly resolved at the end; rather they just seem to pause for the next set of events. That's okay with me, I'm looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.<br /><br />(...)hed novel and it is quite good.

No screenwriter is needed -- the damn thing is a blockbuster script as written. (And yes, Hollywood has optioned it.)<br /><br />In January 1945, a series of defeats across the Pacific had pushed Japan's back to the wall. The American invasion of the Philippines was another decisive blow, but it triggered hideous deeds: Japanese troops (acting with the tacit approval of the War Ministry in Tokyo) massacred helpless American prisoners. As the U.S. Army prepared to take Manila, its top brass knew about these atrocities. They also knew that another POW camp, at a place called Cabanatuan, held 500 American troops who were likely to be killed by the Japanese. These prisoners were the survivors of the infamous \\"Death March,\\" the ordeal that followed the fall of Bataan and Corregidor, the largest surrender in U.S. military history.<br /><br />The Army decided to try to rescue these emaciated prisoners, the \\"ghosts of Bataan.\\" The problem was, they'd have to go deep behind Japanese lines to do it. The troops chosen for the task were 120 strapping soldiers, mostly farm boys who had originally enlisted as mule skinners, who made up a new, elite Army unit called Rangers. They were supported by Filipino guerrillas. Their orders: sneak through 30 miles of enemy territory, kill the Japanese guards, bring out every prisoner alive, and make their way back to the American lines.<br /><br />I will not reveal the story that Sides eloquently tells -- a story celebrated in Life Magazine just weeks after it took place, but that had long since been forgotten. Suffice it to say that it is one of the great stories of World War II.<br /><br />Sides researched Ghost Soldiers deeply, including interviewing many of the men involved: He brings the personalities of the ravaged prisoners and their rescuers to life in a way that's as low-key, decent, and unpretentious as the men themselves. Skillfully weaving together vivid narratives about the Death March and life in the POW camps with a taut account of the raid itself, Ghost Soldiers is destined to become a classic of its genre.

In an effort to destabilize the government, the general of the invading armies seeks to slay the Drenai King. The assassin hired for the job is Waylander. Once a mild-mannered farmer, Waylander is now a master assassin after the brutal killing of his family. After killing the king, Waylander is betrayed by his employer who sends the mysterious Black Brotherhood to dispatch Waylander. The brotherhood is a wily sect of priests who will stop at nothing to see Waylander dead. While on the run, Waylander is approached by a mysterious old man and is informed that he is the only hope of the Drenai people. Waylander must venture into a hostile foreign land and retrieve the legendary Armor of Bronze. Then he must transport it hundreds of miles through enemy held territory to the armies of the Drenai. Only with a general wearing the Armor will the Drenai people be able to repel the invaders. Clearly, this is a suicide mission, which no sane man would undertake. However, Waylander can hardly refuse the request since the old man is the murdered king's father!<br /><br />Gemmell sticks to his familiar formula in continuing his Drenai saga. One man, supported by brave heroes and soldiers, takes on impossible odds to save the Drenai people. While this scenario is effective in the first few Drenai novels, it begins to wear a bit thin here. The character development of Waylander is rich and deep, but the supporting characters are not fleshed out and seem as mere cardboard cut-outs to prop up the obvious plot. While I found it easy to understand and relate to Waylander, the story could have been improved by providing more depth to the supporting characters.<br /><br />Although the plot was engaging, with plenty of action and military sequences, it suffered from a common problem in many of Gemmell's books. He again rushes to a conclusion in the last forty pages of the book. This left me feeling a bit unsatisfied...the same feeling I would have while enjoying a five course meal, but being forced to eat the last two courses in three minutes. My enjoyment of the story would have been enhanced had Gemmell invested another hundred pages in the plot instead of hurrying towards an overly simplistic ending. Despite this shortcoming, the first three-quarters of the plot was quite good and certainly held my interest.<br /><br />Gemmell's latest book in this series again focuses on the character of Waylander (which is why I read this book).

Gemmell continues to be a very popular author in the UK and his popularity is spreading in the US. Since this was perhaps just a stumble on Gemmell's part (perhaps rushing to hit a deadline), I will read the latest novel in the Drenai series since I have enjoyed the previous volumes. <br /> <br />	2005-05-08

Written after the success of Mists, Bradley returns to Avalon, but at a much earlier time in history. In all honesty, I enjoyed this novel much more than The Mists of Avalon. This time, Bradley manages to tell the stories of three different women, beginning in 96 AD and ending in 452 AD, in about half the space!<br /><br />Each of these women's stories could be a stand-alone novella. Their main connection is that they all, at some point, become the Lady of Avalon, the sisterhood's highest and most respected position. Common themes run through each section - devotion to duty, personal sacrifices, self-doubt, to name just a few. The book begins with the tale of Caillean, the first Lady of Avalon. Fleeing the destruction of her previous community by the Romans, she arrives at Avalon with a young boy whose bright spirit will return again during the times Britain will need him most. To help ensure that Avalon will continue to be a refuge from the Romans, it is Caillean who eventually shrouds the island in the mythical mists, removing it from the mortal world.<br /><br />More than seven generations later, Bradley returns to Avalon. Dierna is High Priestess in a land beset by troubles. Although Britain still pays tribute to the Romans, their protection from overseas raiders is sadly lacking. After years of seclusion within the mists, Dierna believes it is time for the Priestesses to return to the world and use their influence for the protection and preservation of Britain. The third and final portion of this tale brings the reader to the time immediately prior to the events that will occur in The Mists of Avalon. Viviane has been raised as the foster daughter of a simple farmer and his wife, until the day Taliesin comes to return her to her rightful place as heir to the Lady of Avalon. Amid personal and religious strife and political upheavals, Viviane must find her own path. This path will ultimately lead to the Holy Grail and the bestowing of a new title, the Lady of the Lake. Her actions will set the course for the mythical figures to come after her - Igraine, Arthur, Morgaine, to name just a few.<br /><br />I suspect the shorter length of this book influenced my opinion, by contributing to my enjoyment of these three interrelated stories. Each era was filled with enough history to be informative and enough action to be interesting, without a lot of the extra verbiage and minutiae Bradley introduces in her earlier Avalon novel. My only complaint regards the way in which Bradley would drop one section and move on to the next. She introduces a number of interesting supporting characters, but you are never really sure what becomes of them when Bradley is through with the main character's story. Still, this is true of real life as well, so it is probably more a matter of my curiosity rather than a flaw of Bradley's. This book is a nice blend of historical and mystical elements and Bradley's interpretation of the Priestesses and their role in Britain's power struggles is quite interesting.his path will ultimately lead to the Holy Grail and the bestowing of a new title, the Lady of the Lake.

Goodkind's debut novel, Wizard's First Rule, is an epic fantasy adventure. The tale begins as Richard Cypher, a not-so-simple woods guide from Westland, rescues the fair Kahlan Amnell from a vicious-looking group of men. Richard soon finds that there is much more to Kahlan than meets the eye. She is from the Midlands, a country steeped in magic and, until now, sealed away from Westland by a magical boundary. Kahlan informs Richard that the boundary is failing and a great evil is threatening them all. She has come to Westland seeking a great wizard. Richard is also searching for something - the person or thing that murdered his father. By agreeing to help Kahlan, Richard begins a journey that will forever change him. It will also shape the future of the world.<br /><br />Without giving away more of the plot, suffice it to say that Goodkind has crafted an intricate and well-designed novel full of unexpected twists and turns. Richard Cypher and Kahlan Amnell are absorbing and likable characters. They both have secrets, some of which the reader knows, others which have yet to be discovered. They are surrounded by a supporting cast of interesting and quirky characters, both good and evil. The world that Goodkind has created is very real in some aspects. Although there is magic aplenty, Goodkind does not rely solely on magic to resolve the problems his characters confront. The only sour note in this novel occurs about three quarters of the way through. Goodkind introduces some very dark and disturbing elements which include pedophilia and sado-masochism. He does use these devices quite effectively to move the plot along, but I still found them to be rather jarring and unexpected. Goodkind also pays quite a bit of attention to character development and motivation.<br /><br />It takes a while to find out what the wizard's first rule is, but once you find out you'll be amazed you didn't think of it first! I'm not sure if Goodkind intended to begin a series when he wrote this first book, but that's what happened. The Sword of Truth series is now heading into its sixth novel, with Faith of the Fallen scheduled for release in August 2000. Fortunately, Goodkind is a considerate author. Wizard's First Rule is a perfectly complete story. While there are definitely more adventures in store for Richard and Kahlan, you won't have to wait with bated breath for the next book to find out if they are rescued from the peril du jour as some authors of series would have you do. That's quite a relief, because at 836 pages for just the first novel, you're looking at a considerable investment in time! Still, I definitely recommend reading Wizard's First Rule.this first book, but that's what happened.

US	14807203	R74V2FMZ1O43	0886778581	174499108	Green Rider	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Britain is working on a sequel!	In Green Rider, our heroine, Karigan G'ladheon, is a feisty and independent soul, perhaps even a bit headstrong and hasty. Expelled from school (unfairly, in her opinion), she chooses to head for home on foot, to face her father's wrath, rather than waiting for it to come to her. Along the way, she encounters one of the mysterious messengers of Sacoridia, a Green Rider. Wounded and near death, he beseeches her to take a vital message to the king. Almost against her better judgement, Karigan swears to deliver the message. With this oath, she finds herself set on a strange and perilous journey, aided only by a mysterious talisman, a nameless, headstrong horse and possibly the ghost of the Green Rider. What Karigan doesn't know is that an evil long believed to be vanquished from the land has returned and is now hunting her.<br /><br />Pursued by unknown assailants bent on preventing the delivery of the message at any cost, Karigan finds help in the unlikeliest of places. In addition to providing assistance, some of the people she meets also contribute a bit of lighthearted humor to some tense situations. Karigan has reason to be grateful for such respite, because she soon discovers that her task will not end with the delivery of the message. In fact, her ordeal has just begun.<br /><br />Green Rider is Britain's first contribution to the fantasy genre. She uses some familiar plot twists and characterizations, but combines them in a way that seems refreshingly new. There is the requisite Evil, embodied by the Gray One, and a fair bit of magic. There are also devious humans, eager to betray or trample anyone in the way of their ambitions. And, of course, there are the true friends, both magical and ordinary, who stand by Karigan when she needs them most.<br /><br />Britain has created a strong and likeable character in Karigan. Some of the minor characters are not as well drawn, which is a shame, since some of them seemed quite interesting. Britain also has a great affinity for the land and the environment and much of this shows in her work. All in all, this is a nice, relatively straightforward fantasy. The pace is good, the action is fast and the philosophy is simple. And, perhaps best of all.affinity for the land and the environment and much of this shows in her work.

Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace.	2005-05-08
US	14807203	R3J5WS7CIKMUMX	0345406141	426738597	How Few Remain (Southern Victory)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A great story about the Civil War	How Few Remain is a pure alternative history book as opposed to alternative history blended with science fiction as in Guns of the South.  Turtledove assumes that several plausible events happened in the original Civil War, which allowed the Confederacy to win.  How Few Remain takes place twenty years after the Civil War.  The Confederacy buys Northern Mexico to enable the Confederate States of America to extend from coast to coast.  This touches off a second war between the United States of America and The Confederate States of America.  The Confederates are joined in the war by their allies England and France.<br /><br />Turtledove follows the action by jumping around the country to various locales of the confrontation.  Real and imagined historical figures are woven into the story.  The action mainly focuses around:<br /><br /> General \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson defending the Yankee advance against Louisville<br /><br /> Jeb Stuart's cavalry (and camelry) launching attacks against the New Mexico territory from former Mexican provinces<br /><br /> Teddy Roosevelt defending Montana from a British invasion launched through Canada<br /><br /> Abraham Lincoln leading socialist rallies<br /><br /> Frederick Douglass' exploits as a war correspondent<br /><br />Can the United States redeem themselves from the disgraceful loss of the first Civil War?  Will the residents of Montana end up speaking with a British accent?  Will Lincoln incite a Marxist revolt in Utah?  I couldn't wait to find out.  Turtledove weaves a fascinating \\"what if\\" scenario that is based on good research of the original Civil War.  Anyone with an interest in the Civil War should find this book fascinating.<br /><br />At first I found the flow of the book slightly annoying since it keeps jumping from place to place to follow the main characters.  However, once I got used to Turtledove's style, the book flowed fairly well.  But be forewarned...if you don't remember your Civil War history, this book will leave you scratching your head wondering what was going on.  Either refresh your memory on the actual Civil War or give this book a pass.ratching your head wondering what was going on.

Although written as the second of what would ultimately become three novels about the priestesses of Avalon, The Forest House actually sets the stage for both of the other novels, beginning as it does in the farthest reaches of British history. Bradley takes the familiar theme of star-crossed lovers and tells it in her own special style.<br /><br />In the time of The Forest House the Druids still hold a great deal of power and Rome is still fighting to prove their sovereignty over their unwilling British subjects. Gaius Macellius is the son of a Roman father and a British mother. Raised as a Roman, he still retains some of the knowledge and language of his mother's culture, and strongly resembles his mother's people. When he is hurt and rescued by native Britons, he is mistakenly identified as a Briton himself. Before he is able to clarify the situation, he realizes he is in the hands of highly placed Druids, enemies to the Romans. One of his caretakers is a young girl, Eilan, daughter of an important Druid leader and granddaughter to the Arch Druid. Before Eilan met Gaius, she dared to hope she might become a priestess of the Goddess. But, after these two young people meet, their hopes for the future change considerably. Despite the odds, each believes they are meant to be together. And it seems perhaps they are, but not in the way they hoped.<br /><br />On its simplest level, this is a story of two young people, deeply in love but tragically separated by fate and political differences. As historical fiction, Bradley describes a turbulent period in Britain's history as the strength of the Druids declines and the Romans begin to assert their ultimate dominion over the native tribes. As with most of Bradley's work, this novel also has a mystical level, describing the ongoing relationship of the Goddess and her people. Bradley's characters are believable and the plot moves along at a steady pace. She shows how easily fate and circumstance can conspire to close off the alternate paths a person's life might take until only one choice is left. I thought this book was very well done, probably the best one of the series.the alternate paths a person's life might take until only one choice is left.

The tired company, including Spar, Brid and Hal, have just returned to Torre Alta bearing the Runes of War, which will protect the fortress for the next nine months. However, with hundreds of thousands of bloodthirsty Vaalakans ready to besiege the fortress, the Runes of War alone are not enough. They need to reunite the Trinity of the Old Faith - the Crone, the Mother and the Maiden. But Morrigwen, the Crone, is near death and an unknown enemy horribly, hopelessly traps Keridwen, the Mother. It is up to the Maiden, Brid, accompanied by Spar and Hal, to search for the mysterious Keepers who can lead them to the Druid's Egg. Their quest takes them further south into the treacherous lands of the New Faith, where recognition may lead to a fiery death. Along the way, the travelers suffer many trials and tribulations, encountering Inquisitors, Vaalakans, and mercenaries, to name just a few. They also receive help from some unexpected quarters.<br /><br />Welch pays less attention to the events taking place at Torre Alta, but some of them are key to the plot. Treachery is afoot, but the besieged people are slow to realize it. Welch gives us some tantalizing glimpses, but little seems to come of it. Frankly, I found this a bit frustrating, but I suspect that all of the pieces will be coming together in the final volume of this series.<br /><br />As with her previous novel, The Runes of War, Welch's descriptions are interesting and complete. Her character development continues to improve. It quickly becomes apparent that some of the main characters are dealing with a lot of inner turmoil. Friendship, rivalry and love will all have a part to play in the final outcome. Welch also has a lot to say about the female-based Old Religion and the male-oriented New Religion, including that the influence each one has on the relationships between men and women. One thing that I did find rather implausible was the way the group always manages to come through their troubles with money and supplies intact. Despite all their problems their purses never seem to be lost, their stomachs are rarely empty, and their clothes usually survive too! The Lost Runes ends on a positive note, but there is still much that needs to be done if Torre Alta, the Trinity, and the world are to be saved.

Taking place about 12 years after the action in Dune, Paul Atreides is now Emperor of the galaxy, ruling from his palace on Arrakis. Legions of Fremen followers revere him as a deity and have led a bloody religious jihad across the universe to spread his philosophy to the \\"unbelievers\\". This has resulted in millions of deaths and the complete obliteration of several planets. Dune Messiah chronicles the attempts of the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild and Emperor Shaddam's daughter (now wife of Paul Atreides) to bring about Paul's downfall.<br /><br />Most of the novel is just silly philosophizing around a muddy plot. Herbert fails to make clear the reasons for the actions that the characters take. Most of the scenes with Paul revolve around him brooding about taking steps to avoid a future timeline that will supposedly bring about the downfall of the galaxy. Unfortunately, Herbert never clearly articulates this peril or makes it seem tangible enough for the reader to care about it. The book lacks the charm of the original as well as the action sequences and any decent political intrigue.<br /><br />Unless you are a die-hard Dune fanatic, don't waste your time with this inferior novel.	2005-05-08

At the conclusion of The Lost Runes the group had located the Keeper's cauldron and found the lost runes, necessary for locating the Druid's Egg. Unfortunately, while doing this they accidentally set loose the runes of sorcery, inadvertently freeing creatures of ominous magic. Joined by the Caldean mercenary, Ceowulf, and the maiden, Cybillia, and pursued by foes, both real and magical, the race is on for the Druid's Egg.<br /><br />Meanwhile at Torre Alta, the heartstone has been stolen and the runes of war have been defaced. Their protection against the evil forces of the Valaakans is quickly waning, but the valiant defenders continue to hold the fortress. Spar and company have no way of knowing this, but they can feel the urgency to find the Egg. Not only will it provide the protection Torre Alta needs, it will help to free the Mother, Keridwen, and contain the magical creatures striving to come into being. If the Egg falls into the wrong hands, all manner of evil will become loosed in the world.<br /><br />By following the clues provided by the lost runes, the group traverses much of the known world. There are many obstacles in their paths and challenges to be overcome. The knowledge that time is running out provides the group with the incentive to continue their quest.<br /><br />As the story progresses, many things that were previously hinted at become clearer. Welch provides a richly detailed narrative and continues to expand on the personalities and motivations of her characters. She wraps up all of the various threads she has woven into a satisfactory, if somewhat predictable, conclusion. I must admit that I saw several of the plot twists coming earlier in this series, but Welch still managed to include an unexpected element or two. All in all, I enjoyed this trilogy and am looking forward to the further exploits of this group which are described in Welch's next trilogy, The Book of &Ouml;nd.ilogy, The Book of nd. <br /> <br />	2005-05-08

All the key fantasy elements are here: dragons, magic, royalty, werecreatures and much more. Unfortunately, Lynn doesn't seem to be able to make up her mind about what direction to take her story in, or even which characters she really wants to focus on.<br /><br />The basic plot line surrounds twin sons born to the Dragon-King. Their birth is both traumatic and tragic. Only one of the boys, Karadur Atani, is born with the legendary dragonblood and the other's resentment festers and grows, hidden throughout their childhood. As the moment of Karadur's change from human to dragon approaches, his twin, Tenjiro, successfully plots to keep his brother from his heritage and disappears, taking one of Karadur's closest companions with him.<br /><br />As the worst winter in memory grips the land, rumors spread of a wizard and the return of an evil thought to be long gone. As Karadur prepares for war, the author begins to concentrate on a side plot involving a romance between a stranger named Wolf and a townswoman. But, almost as soon as the reader is drawn into this plot, Lynn drops it to follow another. The rest of the book tends to proceed in this jerky fashion. I found it very hard to care about the characters once I knew that the author would pick them up and drop them at will. There were also some rather disturbing torture sequences that I felt were a bit too realistic, not to mention lengthy, for my taste. The book does eventually come to something that vaguely resembles a conclusion, but leaves the door wide open for a sequel, not that I'll be looking for it. If you can tolerate the disjointed sequences and enjoy some grisly battles with graphic and violent descriptions, then this book might be for you. But, if you want something that has a well-paced plot with characters that you can care about, you may as well pass this book by.	2005-05-08

Gemmell attempts to recreate the same mood (a stirring heroic fantasy novel) that he created in Legend, but he falls a bit short of the mark this time.<br /><br />Times have changed since Druss the Legend and his stalwart compatriots defended Dros Delnoch from the barbarian hordes. Now the Drenai people are led by a mad emperor who is viciously oppressing his own people. Using ancient arcane technologies that his wizards uncovered, he has created the Joinings...creatures that are half-man, half-beast and all vicious. With the Joinings at his command, throwing off his mantle of tyranny seems unlikely.<br /><br />But Tenaka Khan was descended from legendary heroes. He sees the abomination that the Drenai nation has become and has vowed to redeem his people. But he is a half-breed, despised by the Drenai people and the barbarian hordes alike. Starting with a handful of bold and daring friends, Tenaka must somehow recruit an army and defeat the seemingly unstoppable forces of the emperor.<br /><br />Once again, Gemmell creates some fascinating characters. They are just as likable and heroic as in Legend. The Joinings are inventive, scary foes. The different pieces of the plot are interesting and held my attention, unfortunately, the book seems hurried to an unnatural conclusion. I'm usually against long novels, but this one would have been well served had it been about 100 pages longer. Also, the Joinings were interesting monsters, but Gemmell didn't do much with them since he focused so much of the narrative on fleshing out the heroes. We all like to read about heroic deeds, but the deeds seem much more heroic when the villains' evil machinations are more thoroughly explored. Although, not as good as Legend, The King Beyond the Gate still held my interest enough that I would consider reading the next novel in the series.	2005-05-08

In this collection of eight short stories, he covers topics ranging from demonic possession to unjust imprisonment to soulless machinery. Some of these stories have been published before, mostly in other science fiction anthologies. Most of them are set in the realm of fantasy; only one can truly be called science fiction. Despite their dark and sometimes disturbing themes, I thought these stories were interesting. This may have been due, in part, to the fact that they were not each a full-length novel. Extended doom and gloom may have been too much, but in short bursts, I found Donaldson to be manageable.<br /><br />Quite a few of these stories have an Arabian Nights-type of feeling to them. Many are set in Mid-Eastern or medieval styled countries. I especially enjoyed \\"The Djinn Who Watches Over the Accursed\\" and \\"Penance.\\" Few of Donaldson's stories seem to have unqualified happy endings, but there is usually a lesson to be learned or a point to be made so the ending is usually appropriate, if not always the one the reader might wish for. Donaldson is definitely not the kind of writer who throws his main character into all sorts of trouble and then waves a magic wand to rescue him or her and make things completely better. Instead, there are issues to be worked through and flaws to be dealt with. The main character in Donaldson's tales generally walks away a different person from the individual s/he was initially.	2005-05-08

Mankind's first experience in space travel ended disastrously when it was discovered that it caused severe genetic damage to the travelers. Known as the Hausman effect, it caused Earth to abruptly discontinue all contact with her colonies. The Variants, as they came to be called, were left to fend for themselves. Ultimately, the Guerans brought space travel back to Earth. Unlike many of the Variants, they physically resembled humans. The Guerans' Variation was of the mind and psyche and it was this mutation which enabled them to brave the dangers of space. Their resulting monopoly on space travel and the control exerted by The Guild over intergalactic commerce causes many to fear, hate and envy them. Additionally, there is dissension between the Variants and Earth. The Variants have not forgotten, or forgiven, Earth's abandonment while Earth still fears the strangeness of the Variants.<br /><br />In Friedman's universe the internet is an archaic concept. Rather, she speaks of the Innernet, a planet-wide communication system, and the Outernet, a network spanning the galaxy. Although computers still exist, they are almost entirely obsolete. It has long been decreed that every child would have a computer chip installed in his or her brain at birth. This brainware allows the user to control and access information at a level far beyond our current standards. Now imagine the chaos and destruction that would occur if a virus was let loose in such circumstances. Add in the various factions (Terrans, Guerans, Variants, etc.) and you get a society on the edge of explosion. This is exactly the situation Friedman explores in this novel. She has created several main characters and switches back and forth between them and their seemingly disconnected stories. Jamisia Shido is an orphan, cared for by her tutor, living on a corporate habitat. When treachery befalls the habitat, she is suddenly pushed into a universe of intrigue for which she is ill prepared. Dr. Kio Masada is a highly respected Gueran programmer, trying to unravel the secrets of the virus. Phoenix, a hacker, is trying to discover the creator of the virus, for his own personal reasons.<br /><br />Friedman has developed a highly complex scenario that can be read on several different levels. On the surface it is purely a high-tech mystery, but if you read more closely Friedman has a lot to say about the way people interact and deal with our differences. You won't need to speak \\"computerese\\" to understand the problems caused by the computer virus or the efforts made to stop it. You also won't need to be a psychologist to understand the personalities involved. Additionally, Friedman has inserted some interesting information between chapters. These \\"asides\\" provide some important background along the way and shouldn't be skipped over. Overall, Friedman brings all of the various elements of this novel together into a well-knit whole. The characters are interesting and recognizable. I cared about what happened to them and, although it takes a while for the big picture to come into focus, it is well worth waiting for.

On the surface it is purely a high-tech mystery, but if you read more closely Friedman has a lot to say about the way people interact and deal with our differences. You won't need to speak \\"computerese\\" to understand the problems caused by the computer virus or the efforts made to stop it. You also won't need to be a psychologist to understand the personalities involved. Additionally, Friedman has inserted some interesting information between chapters. These \\"asides\\" provide some important background along the way and shouldn't be skipped over. Overall, Friedman brings all of the various elements of this novel together into a well-knit whole. The characters are interesting and recognizable. I cared about what happened to them and, although it takes a while for the big picture to come into focus, it is well worth waiting for. This is the first book I've read by Friedman, but I definitely plan to add her books to my \\"must read\\" list. <br /> <br />	2005-05-08

Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an \\"excitement addict.\\" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever.<br /><br />Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home.<br /><br />What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.<br /><br />For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.	2005-05-07

In her 964 pages, the author handles a broad and complex sweep of events with considerable technical skill. She is especially good on the great set-piece scenes: her depictions of the Battle of Actium and of the series of spectacular triumphs awarded to Julius Caesar, for example, are brought to us in the novelistic equivalent of living Technicolor.<br /><br />Since the novel is entitled The Memoirs of Cleopatra, events are necessarily filtered exclusively through the Egyptian Queen's own eyes, which is a shame, for Margaret George's Cleopatra seems to suffer from chronic psychological myopia. This has the unfortunate effect of fixing both events and personalities in a single dimension, so that they never come truly alive for us. And since Cleopatra's own musings rarely rise above the banal, we are given very little insight into the minds that shaped what is, after all, one of the major turning points of European history.<br /><br />The narrative is brisk and workmanlike, but marred by dialogue that is almost comically stilted. Both creak under a hefty burden of semi-digested research, which does little more than prove that the author has done her homework. (This we may already guess from the long and erudite bibliography that appears in the Author's Note). She would have served both her art and her readers better if she had learned a little less and woven what she did learn a little more deftly into the fabric of her story.<br /><br />If there's a good and satisfying novel buried here somewhere (and I'm sure there is), ruthless editing would have rescued it. As it stands, the best that can be said of it is that the reader who seeks an undemanding tale rich in romance, pathos and spectacle will not be disappointed. It would help, however, to have both a strong pair of wrists and plenty of time on one's hands.	2005-05-07

Tarr's representation of Charlemagne's court is a composite of the historical court and the Charlemagne depicted in the chanson.<br /><br />Tarr, who holds a Ph.D. in Medieval history, clearly has a deep understanding of such primary sources as Einhard's Vita Caroli, Notker's De Carolo Magno, and the 12th century Chanson de Roland, as well as secondary sources such as Pierre Rich&eacute;'s La Vie Quotidienne dans l'Empire Carolingien. Her tale draws elements from all of those works and her use of short paragraphs is reminiscent of the verse style of the chanson.<br /><br />The novel follows the basic plot of the Chanson de Roland, with Ganelon's arrival at Charlemagne's court, the decision to battle the Muslims in Spain and the subsequent ambush at Roncevalles. After the battle, Tarr follows the historical record, specifically the revolt of Charlemagne's son, Pepin. However, this is juxtaposed with Roland's adventures in Montsalvat, the Kingdom of the Grail, where his greater destiny is revealed.<br /><br />While Tarr takes an interesting an under-explored legend and mixes it with the more popular tale of Arthur, the ideas she presents are more interesting than the novel itself. She never manages to get the pacing correct, and the characters are led by their fates rather than any sense of free will, although towards the end of the novel, the question of free will becomes important in and of itself.<br /><br />Early in the novel, Roland forms a relationship with the mysterious Sarissa. However, the sense of mystery feels forced and the reader never really wonders where Sarissa comes from. Of more concern is why the two characters are together, since there does not appear to be any real chemistry between them.<br /><br />Tarr has a great ability to create potentially interesting situations using historical precedents. Unfortunately, she has not yet mastered the ability to turns these stories into entertaining novels. While a fast-paced novel certainly isn't required, especially when dealing with more philosophical issues, Tarr could certainly increase the pacing in Kingdom of the Grail.een them.  <br /> <br />Tarr has a great ability to create potentially interesting situations using historical precedents.

It is a classic science-fiction horror novel about a vampire traveling to London from Transylvania in the late 1800's. The novel opens with a journal entry from one of the main characters, Jonathan Harker, traveling by train to Transylvania to meet Count Dracula. During his visit, Jonathan notices abnormalities in the castle and even more strange incidents with the Count.<br /><br />Eventually, Jonathan is forced to escape from the Count by jumping into a river from the top of the castle. Jonathan, however, accidentally entices the Count to meet Jonathan's fiancee and their friends and pulls him into their world.<br /><br />After the death of one of their friends, the main characters become obsessed with ridding the world of the Count. The reading is difficult at times because the story is written in journal entries by the main characters about the same subject other characters are also writing or talking about.<br /><br />All and all, I enjoyed Dracula very much, and encourage all who like horror or suspense novels to read it. If you saw the movie from the early 1990's, the story lines are quite different.	2005-05-05

The year is 323 B.C., and Alexander the Great is dead. The story begins with the trial of Machon, one of Alexander's confidants. Machon is accused of contravening the instructions given by the Assembly when he joined Alexander, thus betraying public trust, and of committing impiety before the god, known in human form as Alexander III.<br /><br />The trial is held in Athens in what I suppose is traditional Athenian manner. (See the author's afterword for more.) There is much political uncertainty and unrest in Athens now that Alexander is dead and no longer able to protect the city from the Macedonians. The jury is selected at random; for this trial fifty men from each tribe are selected, totaling 500 jurors. The indictment itself is brought by the prosecutor Aeschines, who speaks first, and gives evidence relating to the charges brought against Machon. He is a persuasive and dramatic man, who has a presence reminiscent of his theater days. With ease and flair, he presents his case, and clearly, one is swayed by his characterization of Machon, son of Agathon.<br /><br />Then Machon presents his case, and as a juror nicknamed Swallow realizes, \\"This might be something.\\" And something it is. The tale Machon weaves is one of intrigue, gripping, bold and mesmerizing. We learn of Alexander and all his vulnerabilities, his foibles; in short, we learn of the incredible toll that ten years of travel and conquering took on the \\"god\\" Alexander. What we see, in the end, is a man like any other. A brilliant strategist, a cunning and charismatic military leader, and a man who was relentless in his desire to conquer, but a man all the same.<br /><br />And what happens to Machon? Is he successful in his fight for freedom? The tale weaves history, tradition, politics, suspense, thrills, and even humor in its excellent plot. I thoroughly enjoyed EMPIRE OF ASHES and recommend it to all those who enjoy reading accounts of this fascinating man. What's true and what's not? Frankly, I don't care. I don't claim to be a purist; I am just an average reader looking for a great read. I found it in EMPIRE OF ASHES.accounts of this fascinating man. What's true and what's not? Frankly, I don't care.

I loved the American Revolution with a passion for a time, but hated discussing the 19th century. Specifically, I hated the Civil War. When my history teacher handed me Gods and Generals by Jeff Shaara and said, \\"Read this,\\" I was skeptical. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. The book chronicles the Civil War up to the events described in The Killer Angels (by Shaara's father, Michael) by jumping from one major player to another.<br /><br />Gods and Generals follows the Civil War closely and presents realistic and likeable characters, although it gets off to a slow start. It is not even clear that the war had begun for 50 pages and takes another 50 for things to really get exciting. Character introductions are rather dull, and describe in detail aspects only slightly relevant to the character with no relevance to the overall plot. After the introductions, everyone decides where their loyalties lie, make their way to an army and then, at last, things begin to pick up. By the end of the book, I could not bring myself to put it down.<br /><br />One aspect that definitely detracted from my enjoyment of this book was Shaara's writing style. This is his first book, and he attempts to be so flowery that it gets in the way of the actual story. If I tried, I could probably count on both hands the number of sentences without commas in the first 100 pages. As the book progresses, though, the style seems to take a back seat to content - things begin to happen that actually interest the reader. This shift makes the book infinitely more readable.<br /><br />General Robert E. Lee, Winfield Scott Hancock and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain are initially loyal to the country, but when Virginia votes to secede from the Union, Lee, a Virginia native, decides to go with his homeland and join the Confederacy. Hancock is stationed in San Francisco and must deal with local demonstrations and discussions of loyalties while deciding his own. Chamberlain, probably my favorite character, was a professor at Bowdoin College until he saw hordes of students leaving to join the army and decides he wants to help. He struggles to fit in as the second in command of a division of the Federal Army. Shaara writes about these characters so well that during the Battle of Williamsburg I desperately wanted Hancock to win, while during the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run) I wanted to cheer along with Lee when the Federal Army soldiers run for their lives.<br /><br />Despite his imperfect writing style, Shaara's lifelike characters and dialogue, combined with political upheaval, make Gods and Generals an interesting and very entertaining book. The Civil War is portrayed realistically and in a way I could relate to. Writing in a way that discards the violin music from the background (see the PBS documentary on the Civil War), Shaara converted me from hating all things to do with the Civil War to appreciating what happened in this segment of our history.eciding his own.

No, the Secret Service handles a lot of different things, but the biggie is the protection of the President of the United States. The immediate image that pops up is a bunch of big guys in nice suits and serious sunglasses, all of them flanking POTUS and looking grimly in different directions. It's not an act; no one wants another Dallas on their watch. The agents clustered around POTUS constitute the Fourth Perimeter; there is no fifth. Four is as close as it gets and no one is supposed to breach that. So what happens when a former Secret Service agent, someone who has been there and knows all the precautions and all the preparations, decides to kill the President? One answer is provided in THE FOURTH PERIMETER, the latest novel by Tim Green.<br /><br />Kurt Ford is the ex-Secret Service agent who is driven to breach the Fourth Perimeter. His motivation is nothing less than heated, single-minded revenge. Ford, a retired agent turned successful technology entrepreneur, rules a perfect world with more money than he could ever reasonably spend, an intelligent and beautiful wife-to-be who is successful in her own right and an adult son who is building his own successful career in the Secret Service. Ford's perfect world is shattered, however, when his son is found dead in bed, a victim of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The official explanation is that young Ford committed suicide, but his father refuses to believe that and begins a relentless hunt for justice for his son. When he is told by an unimpeachable source that his son was murdered at the behest of the President, Ford's only focus is on bringing the most powerful man in the world to rough and personal justice.<br /><br />He begins to meticulously plan his revenge, with his biggest problem being how to breach the Fourth Perimeter. He finally hits upon a brilliant scheme: rather than invading it, Ford will build it around himself. Ford slowly and carefully constructs every detail of his plan --- meeting the President, executing his plan and the man, as well as his escape. It seems as if the plan cannot fail. But a number of pitfalls and surprises await Ford as he rushes headlong to his fateful, carefully planned meeting with the President.<br /><br />Green continues to hone his craft well, bringing together elements of suspense and thorough research to create readable and enjoyable novels with tales that are grounded in the real world.

Just like the game it covers, it is very welcoming to players that are completely new to the genre. It starts with a chapter giving an introduction to MMORPGs in general, a walkthrough of your first day in the game, and common tactics and roles of the different classes in a group.<br /><br />Just like the EQ2 book, it has descriptions of the races and classes, lists of equipment, and a chapter on crafting. It also has a chapter on PvP, an interview about future raid content, and the bestiary the EQ2 book was missing. There is an atlas, but the maps are just screenshots of the (useful enough) in-game maps. The atlas also has descriptions of the zones, with lists of quests, NPCs, and resources to be found there.<br /><br />The best part of the book are the comics from Gabe and Tycho of Penny Arcade fame. Those are really funny descriptions of the many humorous situations that can happen in a game like World of Warcraft. The weakest part is that there are no maps or descriptions of the instanced dungeon zones, which are the games strongest group-based content and the source of the best loot.<br /><br />If you were playing both games but had the money for only one of the books, you should probably buy the Everquest 2 one. The World of Warcraft book is in no way worse, but the game of WoW is a lot more helpful than the game of EQ2, thus the EQ2 strategy guide ends up being more useful. WoW not only gives out a lot more information in the game itself, it also has one single website as alternative source for all information you are likely to want to know.<br /><br />If you are only playing one of these games and you don't have a second computer for looking up information while you play, buying the strategy guide for the game you play is a good idea. Both books contain useful information, which could save you a lot of running and searching around in game.

I first read this book over two years ago and it says something about the potency of the story that I (who am usually bad at remembering names) can still rattle off the characters' names -- Sidney Carton, Doctor and Lucy Mannette, Charles Darnay, Madame DeFarge ... I began reading the book sitting outside on a hot summer day, but was soon actually feeling cold as I was drawn into the freezing rain and mud of the openning scene on the Dover Mail coach. This book has it all: romance and tragedy, mystery and history, revolutionary atrocities and courtroom drama, not to mention both openning and closing lines which are unforgettable and famous (It was the best of times, it was the worst of times ...). It's a book that truly transports you to another time, one of history's most terrible and frightening, as well as one of its most idealistic and noble. A word to all those kids who had to read it for school and gave it bad reviews: there is something about having to ! read a book for school that makes you hate it. Don't let that throw you. Read it again ten years from now, after you've had a chance to experience life (both the good and bad stuff) a bit more, after you've learned a bit more history so you can understand all the book's allusions, and when you (and this time not your teacher) are really in the mood to read, and you'll see why this book is considered one of the truly great classics.	2005-04-10

A tall task to ask of anyone, but as ever the lads are game and get stuck into the enemy as only they know how. But this time they have the help of one Prasutagus and his fiery bride to be Boudica.<br /><br />The adventureis gripping and literally page turning, and hte characrters play off each other like seasoned Quentin Tarantino pros. The dialogueis crisp and credible, and the languageis exactly what you would expect from soldiers. Thisis no prissy Cornwell novel, these guys are three-dimensional with all the failings of real people. That's why the seriesis so successful; despite the fact that we know Macro and Cato are going to get out of whatever hot water they are in, their escapeis never signposted and the readeris kept on tenterhooks right up until whatever qualified victory they achieve at the end.<br /><br />Frankly, a military adventure series doesn't get any better than this and when you compare it to the swathe of poor quality fiction set in Rome that finds its way into bookshops, Scarrow's books shine out like a jewel in a middle of the midden (to coin a phrase).	2005-04-10

I am at the moment reading classics and currently in the middle of reading most of Jane Austen's books. All her stories are delightful, but I can honestly say that this one is my favorite so far. It has a good and interesting storyline, as well as some very likable and some unlikable characters. You will quickly grow to like Elizabeth and her sister Jane, while their mother and younger sisters may annoy you to no end. All in all though it is a good book.<br /><br />For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is the tale of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who at the beginning of the book seem to be polar opposites, with the only thing in common being their great dislike for each other. The story also involves Elizabeth s sister Jane and Mr. Darcy s best friend Mr. Bingley, though Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are by far the main characters. Besides having quite a bit of witty dialogue, it has a few surprising turn of events that seem to make the book even more interesting. At first like Elizabeth, you too may greatly dislike Mr. Darcy, but as the book goes on he tends to grow on you, and by the end of the book, you'll be firmly in love with both of them.<br /><br />A good lesson can be pulled from the book as well. Elizabeth jumped to conclusions and let some people prejudice her against Mr. Darcy, while at the beginning of the book Mr. Darcy was as proud and arrogant as could be. Which can teach that we need to be careful on judging other people, because the way they act and what we may hear about them may be entirely false. It s also a good illustration on how pride can really mess up your relationships with others.<br /><br />If you're interested in reading this book then go for it, and don't let the fact that it s quite a long book deter you. Take the book in strides. I know I usually read very fast, but at first I read it rather slowly and I honestly didn't really enjoy it until I got to section two of the book. So even if at first you don't like it, try to keep reading, it gets better as you go on. It really does! Don t let the fact that it's a classic, written in the early 1800s bother you either, broaden your horizons a bit and learn to appreciate classic literature- it's truly a delight. After all, they had to become famous classics for a reason! So enjoy your turn at Pride and Prejudice, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!it until I got to section two of the book.

Sure, when you read it, in 10th grade or whenever, you get that essential tale of Ahab's monomaniacal pursuit of the White Whale, but you don't get much of the fascinating detail of the whaling industry nor much of the symbolism that makes the book one that rewards repeated readings.<br /><br />In fact, Melville's fiction is so densely packed with symbolism and allusions that it's sometimes hard to believe that he has any central message.  This is particularly noticeable in the great short story Bartleby, the Scrivener.  One finishes the story with no idea whatsoever why Bartleby has stopped working and given up on life, but the story is so open that you can give it any number of meanings and argue them all plausibly.  Moby Dick is similarly amenable to many different interpretations.  After initially being understood as a tale of the struggle against evil, it is now taken, mainly in the academy, to be an indictment of capitalism and industrialization.<br /><br />Personally, I like to think of it as a joyous answer to the dour Existentialists, with their insistence that life is meaningless drudgery.  It is a curious thing that we should so admire men like Ahab, clearly grown demented in his pursuit of Moby Dick, or even a character like Don Quixote, whose immersion in the fiction of chivalry has obviously left him brain-addled.  What is it we find so compelling in such figures ?  I think it is their unalterable sense of purpose, however deranged.  What after all is Existentialism but an expression of the desire that they too were guided by such a singular vision of the purpose of life ?<br /><br />We easily recognize that this is not the vow of a well man, but it's awfully hard not to get caught up in the passion, and the absolute conviction, that he evinces.  To me it suggests that any man's life can be made heroic by his devotion to a noble purpose; though, as the tragedy that ensues makes clear, this devotion is best tempered by some sense of perspective.<br /><br />In the end, perhaps what Melville is best at isn't conveying a conventional moral or a message; perhaps what he does best is to tangle the reader up in the psychological mood of his central characters.  Though the novel incorporates many classic themes--particularly the Biblical themes of crucifixion and resurrection and the great American theme of men fleeing the suffocation of civilization--it is truly unique.  If you haven't read it since you were a teen, give it another try now; you'll be surprised at the complex and multi-layered tale you'll find in these pages.n's life can be made heroic by his devotion to a noble purpose; though, as the tragedy that ensues makes clear, this devotion is best tempered by some sense of perspective.  <br /> <br />In the end, perhaps what Melville is best at isn't conveying a conventional moral or a message; perhaps what he does best is to tangle the reader up in the psychological mood of his central characters.

One hot day, he is called to aid a neophyte advocate named Cicero, who is defending a man charged with that most serious of ancient crimes, parricide. The accused will say little in his own defence and hired killers dog the footsteps of all potential witnesses to the crime. The further Gordianus digs into this complex case, the more layers of \\"truth\\" are uncovered -- and the more danger threatens his own household.<br /><br />The plot is well-planned and reasonably fair to those who are familiar with the milieu. The author is plainly fascinated with the era and has done a lot of homework; but this book is uneasily balanced between the genres of historical fiction and crime fiction. I hesitate to mention genre boundaries because in general I don't believe in them; but in this case the reader should be aware that the book is extremely slow-paced for a mystery, and rather clumsy for a historical novel.<br /><br />Some historical novelists are sketchers, some are watercolor artists, some are oil painters -- Saylor is a creator of mosaics, patiently toiling away forever to create the desired image from thousands of little tiles. He's perfectly capable of devoting several paragraphs to a character getting ready for bed, or a landscape, or the exterior of a house; and not just once per book, but multiple times per chapter. In any other writer, I'd conclude that this was a first-time novelist problem, but in Mr. Saylor's case I think it may be his natural style -- I mean, anyone who reads Sallust and Plutarch for fun can't exactly be a fan of stripped-down prose. This quirk is particularly pronounced in the parts of the book which deal with the political background of the time: not only is there a longish biography of Sulla (which reads exactly like the introduction to a Penguin Classic and really spoils the first-person narration -- why would Gordianus have to explain Sulla to anyone of his own era?), but the author devotes twenty pages to the rhetorical flourishes of both prosecution and defense in the murder trial. Personally, I deplore speeches in a novel; and since I was forced to read Cicero as a child, I felt no compunction about skipping these orations after a cursory skim. In passing, I should mention that there is an unusual amount of sex for a historical mystery, but almost no humor.<br /><br />In sum, Mr. Saylor's work is intelligent, well researched, deliberate, and written in thoughtful prose. However, it made my spine itch with impatience throughout -- I kept skipping ahead to find some action, and then forcing myself to go back (but only because I was obligated to review the book; otherwise, I would just have skimmed the whole thing). This book is like creamed spinach: it's unclear whether it's really good, or whether you convince yourself it's good because it's so patently good for you.-- why would Gordianus have to explain Sulla to anyone of his own era?), but the author devotes twenty pages to the rhetorical flourishes of both prosecution and defense in the murder trial.

But there was something really curious and elusive about the storytelling.  In the first place, the heroes are mere observers of the climactic sea battle, having been captured earlier, which seemed especially curious for an adventure story.  Even more disconcerting was the sense that I lacked much of the background information that the author expected the reader to bring to the novel.  It seemed as if O'Brian expected you to already be familiar with much of the early 19th century naval terminology, with the intricacies of the Napoleonic Wars, and with the culture, customs and language of the day.  It was like listening to a comedian and only understanding one out of every two or three jokes--you titter nervously and you can follow along thanks to context, but it's a tad humiliating.  I did like it enough to read the next though, Post Captain, and as I did, the joke finally dawned on me.<br /><br />Patrick O'Brian writes these novels so that they could be read, understood, and enjoyed by the characters who populate them.  The reason that they so effectively transport us to another time and place is because they seem to have been written there and then.  His mission here is not to explain that epoch to us, but to present it for our consideration, nearly unadorned by modern sensibilities.  He writes as if he were actually a contemporary of his heroes and the books have the quality, not of historical novels at all, but instead of classic tales newly rediscovered.  Thanks to this unusual style, O'Brian is more often compared to Jane Austen than to C. S. Forester.<br /><br />I don't mean to mislead anyone; the books aren't for all tastes and, even if you love them, O'Brian's  manner can be frustrating--you sometimes wish you had an interpreter.  But once you figure out what he's doing, if you accept the technique, you're in for a real treat.  The writing is outstanding.  The setting is endlessly interesting.  Aubrey, the bluff and hearty sea captain, and Maturin, the vulpine doctor and spy, make for a classic pairing of steadfast opposites, in the tradition of Holmes and Watson.  It is not easy reading but it is rewarding and once you read a couple, you'll be hooked.  And be warned, before he died earlier this year, O'Brian had completed twenty novels in the series, so you'll be hooked for a good long time.interpreter.

Among those chores are reviewing requests for Presidential pardons. The President is not emotionally up to the task because in his view, \\"How sad that after four tumultuous years of leading the free world it would all fizzle into one miserable pile of requests from a bunch of crooks.\\" But one of those crooks has a very influential advocate on behalf of his pardon. The Director of the CIA makes a rare visit to the White House to suggest that Joel Backman, a former powerful \\"Beltway\\" lobbyist who has spent six years in prison, be released. The President accedes to the wishes of the Director, and Backman finds himself hurriedly summoned to the prison facility where he's incarcerated to work out the hasty conditions of his pardon.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Backman, his pardon is not the result of an altruistic motive by the government. The truth is that the broker is the bait. Backman had gone to prison as a result of a scheme to sell a satellite system to the world's highest bidder. The U.S. wants to know who owned the system and had access to its secrets. They theorize that once the broker is established in a new location with a new identity, the actual owner will exact their revenge on Backman by assassination. In that fashion an important piece of intelligence data now will be unearthed. Backman is the cheese in the mousetrap and the CIA does not worry if he gets eaten so long as they can locate the mouse.<br /><br />Backman is spirited out of the country and relocated to Italy. Most of THE BROKER is set in Bologna, Italy, which may be the first time that a Grisham novel is set outside of his native South. The location gives Grisham an opportunity to share with his readers his love and knowledge of Italian history, architecture and cuisine. As most successful authors do, Grisham has researched his subject matter in great detail.

Richard Papen is a lower middle class Californian who has wended his way to Hampden College in Vermont, largely because he like the picture on the catalogue. Richard happens to be proficient in several languages, so he tries getting into one of Professor Julian Morrow's classical language classes.  But he discovers that Morrow only teaches a select handful of students and teaches every class that they take.  They form an elite clique within the elite campus.  Eventually, Richard attaches himself to this group and is admitted to Morrow's disciple hood.<br /><br />Morrow remains a sort of opaque presence, but Richard's life is soon entwined with the other students, lead by the wealthy & arrogant Henry Winter and including Charles and Camilla MacCaulay, the overly close twins, Francis Abernathy, a flamboyant homosexual, and Edmund \\"Bunny\\" Corcoran, a rumpled preppy of dubious social grace.  Richard longs to fit into this group and, ashamed of his rather plebeian origins, is soon inventing a fake background for himself and taking on pseudo sophisticated airs.<br /><br />However, there's more to this little clan than meets the eye, and as the story unfolds, he discovers that during an attempt to recreate a Dionysian frenzy, Henry, Francis and the twins have killed a local man. Now Bunny has found them out & is basically blackmailing them, exacting a cruel revenge for their many slights.  Inevitably, they decide that Bunny must die and the rest of the book deals with the murder's aftermath.<br /><br />When this book was first published it was attended by tremendous hype, both because of the youth of the author and because of her mentors, Willie Morris & Brett Easton Ellis among them.  But the hype, and the comparisons to Crime and Punishment,  could not obscure the fact that Ms Tartt had penned an absorbing gothic mystery which quickly became a bestseller.<br /><br />I agree with many of the criticisms of the novel.  Some of the characters are underwritten and we are not adequately exposed to the teaching of Julian Morrow that makes him so attractive to the students.  However, these legitimate gripes are outweighed by the creepy mesmeric can't-put-it-down story that the author weaves.<br /><br />In addition, I think there's another reading that you can apply to the book with some profit.  The effete, elitist, amoral, hothouse atmosphere fostered by Morrow and embraced by the clique is an apt metaphor for the modern university.  Here are students who are absorbed by their studies, or at least by the aura of their studies, 24 hours a day, who cede complete control of their own minds to their instructor.  Not content with the elitism of a University so expensive that there are few middle class students anyway, they've further segregated themselves into a small band of like minded students. If they get in trouble, it's in the pursuit of some romantic intellectual ideal and after all, who do they kill, just a townie and a slacker student.<br /><br />However you interpret the story, it's a rewarding reading experience.Tartt had penned an absorbing gothic mystery which quickly became a bestseller.  <br /> <br />I agree with many of the criticisms of the novel.

See kwon- in<br /><br />  Indo-European Roots.]<br /><br />Such are the real dictionary definitions of the stance which Ambrose Bierce adopted in considering the world.  Beginning in 1881 and continuing to 1906, he created a series of sardonic word definitions of his own.  Many of these were collected and published as The Cynic's Word Book, which he later protested was \\"a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve.\\"  So in 1911, he pulled together a collection that was more to his own liking and called it The Devil's Dictionary.  The entries are a tad uneven in quality, but most are amusing and some are great.  Each reader will have his own favorites, some of mine are as follows :<br /><br />  ACQUAINTANCE, n.

A degree of friendship called slight when its object is poor or obscure, and intimate when he is rich or famous.<br /><br />ALLIANCE, n.

One who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not entertain.<br /><br />BORE, n. A person who talks when you wish him to listen.<br /><br />CONSULT, v.i.

Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision.<br /><br />DICTIONARY, n.  A malevolent literary device for cramping the<br /><br />  growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic.  This<br /><br />  dictionary, however, is a most useful work.<br /><br />DISCRIMINATE, v.i. To note the particulars in which one person or thing is, if possible, more objectionable than another.<br /><br />EDUCATION, n. That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding.<br /><br />FUTURE, n. That period of time in which our affairs prosper, our<br /><br />  friends are true and our happiness is assured.<br /><br />HISTORY, n.  An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools.<br /><br />IDIOT, n.

And, of course, your teacher analyzed all the Christian symbolism, from the bleeding palms to the marlin carcass as Cross.  Allow me to take a little different tack.<br /><br />I recently had the great displeasure of reading The Affluent Society.  Mr. Galbraith argued that as Western society reached the novel stage of being affluent, that is producing enough goods to meet the subsistence needs of every member of society, we would inevitably rebel against the notion of work, our work hours would dwindle, people would demand four or even three day weeks and many would opt out of the workplace all together.  We now realize of course that this was the idle prattle of an effete twit.  Instead, the past fifty years have seen the massive entry of women into the workplace (as a form of liberation no less) and folks working well past retirement age and the past five years have seen the government demand that even the chronic unemployed get jobs or lose benefits.  How could Karl Marx and Galbraith and all those liberal thinkers have been so wrong about what motivates people?  It is quite simply a function of their dependence on materialism.  This blinded them to cultural and spiritual influences on mankind and they failed to reckon with these forces.<br /><br />Hopefully, nobody who has ever read The Old Man and the Sea could possibly fail to understand that, for most people, doing a job well, even, or especially, a physically taxing job, provides an abiding sense of gratification and self worth.  Most of us are not alienated from our labor, we are challenged by it.  Because of the dignity and grace that the old fisherman, Santiago, demonstrates in rising to face the challenge--his exhibition of hard won skill and his determination in the face of overwhelming odds--this book reaffirms the indomitable human spirit and reminds us of the possibility of encountering the sublime in every day life and in the most lowly of labors and laborers.<br /><br />There is more insight to the soul of man in the scant 127 pages of this book, than in all the volumes of Marxist/Socialist pablum spewed forth in the past 100 years.  It is a fitting tribute, on the Centennial of Hemingway's birth, that we remember him for this great tale.le human spirit and reminds us of the possibility of encountering the sublime in every day life and in the most lowly of labors and laborers.  <br /> <br />There is more insight to the soul of man in the scant 127 pages of this book, than in all the volumes of Marxist/Socialist pablum spewed forth in the past 100 years.

It keeps you glued to your chair both by its plot, but also by its writing. This is not fast food writing. This is not the kind of writing that you consume like french fries, enjoy and forget instantly. The prose is beautiful, every word seemingly chosen with care to build up a scene or create a mood. The quote that began this review is one example. Here is another to describe the collapse of the government and the end of law and order, \\"All organizations were losing coherency, losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body.\\"<br /><br />Right from the start, the reader is given a growing sense of danger, dread and horror. The narrator (who seems to be Wells, himself) describes the ancient, doomed civilization of Mars. It is doomed because Mars itself is a dying planet and the Martians must look elsewhere if they are to survive. They look to the earth and they have a technology so advanced and a moral sense so non-existent, that people do not exist for them except as a nuisance to be gotten rid of.<br /><br />Having given the reader that background information, Wells describes the landing of a mysterious object near the small English town where he is living happily with his wife. The object is regarded at first as a meteorite, then as a curiosity and then as an enigma as it slowly opens. No one sees it as dangerous until it lashes out with a deadly heat ray, killing people. (Clearly Wells anticipated the invention of the laser!) When these first deaths occur, the narrator hastily sends his wife to stay with relatives a few miles away, not anticipating any real danger, but just being sensibly cautious. He himself quite matter of factly returns home and is suddenly plunged into the midst of chaos and danger. The Martians are on the move. More and more of the strange objects are landing. The Martians ignore all efforts to communicate and contemptuously destroy all human efforts at attack or defense. The Martians begin a sweep of the countryside, slaughtering everyone in their path.<br /><br />So everyone expects that the moment the British army goes into action against the Martians, the Martians will be doomed. Instead, the Martians simply annihilate the British army. The highest technology known to man is slapped aside like the stinging of mosquitoes. That is all man is to the invader, a pesky insect. Or, as a soldier who is the sole survivor of his unit tells the narrator, their best efforts were: \\"It's bows and arrows against the lightning.\\" I doubt that we, reading it today, can fully grasp how shocking that must have sounded to the average Victorian reader.<br /><br />That was Well's intention -- to shock the reader. It's no accident that he used the simile of bows and arrows against the lightning. Great Britain (along with the other Western powers) had been able to conquer \\"savages\\" around the world because the British had the lightning (guns) and the \\"savages\\" had only bows and arrows. Out of those victories came a sense of moral superiority the concept that Western civilization was superior instead of admitting that it was only Western technology that was momentarily superior. Wells was a writer on social issues and he used science fiction to show what would happen if the British Empire came up against aliens who were as far beyond them as they were beyond the \\"savages\\" they had conquered and who treated them as they did the \\"savages.\\" In War of the Worlds, it is made very clear that the Martians really don't behave any worse towards humans than humans behave towards each other. In fact, he comments early in his story, \\"Before we judge of them (the Martians) too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought...Are we such Apostles of Mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\\"<br /><br />Wells wanted his readers to think and feel what it means to be aconquered people who are conquered and destroyed not through lack of courage or effort but simply because the enemy's technology is superior. I have no idea how many readers of the day understood the message and learned humility from it. War of the Worlds began that popular part of science fiction that imagines invasions from outer space, the most recent being the blockbuster Independence Day. Here the message is, unfortunately, that even though alien technology is superior, humans are able to cleverly find a way to defeat the enemy.

It might be a poem that really grasps you, or the book that started a love of science fiction, or a speech that hit some nerve and lingers in the heart.<br /><br />For me, one of these was The First Man In Rome, by Colleen McCollough. My grandma had gotten it for a few dollars in the bargain bin at Target, and one day she handed it to me, and said I would love it. Now, I wasn't exactly a stranger to thick books; I'd been reading Tom Clancy for two years. But for some reason, this book intimidated me. Not wanting to disappoint my grandmother however, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I was hooked from the very first page. It enthralled me so much that soon after I finished it, I went and bought the first two sequels. The series is set in Rome of the late Republican era, and starts in 110 BC. The First Man In Rome revolves around two main characters. Gaius Marius is a wealthy Plebian statesman and experienced army commander, whose further political ambitions have been foiled by the conservative aristocrats of the Senate, led by the Caecilii Metelli family. Marius is a \\"New Man,\\" a newcomer to wealth and power who has no illustrious ancestors. He isn't even a Roman, strictly speaking, but an Italian, who the contemporary ruling class regard as an uppity country oaf.<br /><br />Lucius Cornelius Sulla, on the other hand, is a Patrician of most noble birth and lineage; by rights he should have already been well on his way to power and influence. But a dwindling family fortune coupled to his late father's alcoholism has left him destitute. Fate decrees that the fortunes of both men will change drastically....<br /><br />Through the book, both Sulla and Marius rise to power and influence, on the both the field of battle and in the political arena. Every paragraph drew me in, and kept me reading until I was sad as my fingers turned the very last page. The author has performed an enormous amount of research, and the world of Republican Rome is recreated in vivid detail, from its greatest glory to its most terrible depravity. The characters, whether historical or truly fictional, are complex and fascinating. And there is an overall aura of mystique associated with fate, fortune, and destiny.<br /><br />This is the book that really got me into Ancient Rome. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Marius and Sulla were not just great characters conjured in an author's imagination, but were instead real historical figures! I started reading more and more, and I've never looked back.kept me reading until I was sad as my fingers turned the very last page.

US	14807203	R27WKJUBNGTO63	0553213296	427012340	The Last of the Mohicans (Bantam Classics)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	An early example of American Literature	Reading this, it's easy to see why James Fennimore Cooper is considered the first true American novelist. A comparison with the rather talky, and overly descriptive English novels of the time, shows that this is vastly different.<br /><br />First, of course, this is about the exploits of the common man. Hawkeye, the main white character, is the quintessential rugged individualist, eschewing society to live in the woods and travel with his Indian companions.<br /><br />Then there is the natural setting--the woods and streams and waterfalls of upstate New York, which appear almost as characters, themselves in the novel. And then, of course, there is that most American of stories, the decimation of the Indian populations.<br /><br />Having not read this book since I was in grade school, I found it suprisingly enjoyable. I was also surprised to find that the true emphasis of the story was the relationship between Hawkeye, the white scout,and the Mohicans, rather than the love story cooked up for the 1991 movie, and that a love interest also exhisted between the young Mohican, Uncas, and Munro's daughter, Cora,who, expediently, turned out to be of mixed race herself.<br /><br />As historical fiction, this is very accurate. And though the Indians are generally depicted,at their worst, as inhuman savages, and, at their best, as surprisingly bright and sensitive savages, for the time in which it was written, it was probably rather daring, and the most one could expect toward bridging the gap between the races.<br /><br /> I would definitely recommend that those who think of this as one of those classics they were forced to read in school, give it a second try. You may be pleasantly surprised.	2005-04-03

It is more piecemeal than the completed novels, The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, which was in progress when J.R.R. Tolkien died. The Silmarillion was pulled together and edited by his son Christopher.<br /><br />The book is separated into four sections. The first section is the First Age and contains stories on the coming of Tuor to Gondolin and the tale of Hurin's Children. The Tale of Hurin's children in touched on in the Silmarillion but this story is much more in-depth and while fans of the Tolkien mythologies know is a tragic tale this version is most complete.<br /><br />The second section of the book is the Second Age and focuses much on the Numenor. There is a description of the island of Numenor. This section contains the tale of the Mariner's Wife, which is another great and tragic story among the tales of Middle-Earth. There is a section on various kings of Numenor and a History of Galadriel and Celeborn. I found the history of Galadriel very interesting, and full of information that made events in later tales more meaningful<br /><br />The third section of Unfinished Tales is the Third Age. This portion of the book contains: The Disaster on the Gladden Fields, a history on the relationship between Gondor and Rohan, The Quest for Erebor, a portion on the hunt for the One Ring, And the Battles of the Rods of Isen, which ultimately lead to the death of Theodred, the son of King Thoden. This section of the book had lots of additional information for fans of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbits to consume and make their enjoyment of the stories that much fuller.<br /><br />The fourth and final section of the book contains sections on the Druedain (or Wild Men), the Istari (or Wizards) and the palantiri (or seeing stones). This section was also very valuable in adding information to the Lord of the Rings. I was very fond of the story The Faithful Stone and found the history of the Wild Men more colorful than expected. My suspicions about the origin of the Istari were validated in this section of the book as well. And my understanding of the palantiri went up substantially from near zero.<br /><br />Overall I would suggest this book to any Tolkien fan after reading at least the Lord of the Rings but better to have read the Hobbit and Silmarillion to get the most out of the tales and told in Unfinished Tales. Unfortunately, the stories are unfinished and in a few cases I found myself really wanting more but that's just the way it goes.he Wild Men more colorful than expected.

In succeeding Constantius, he was regarded as a vigorous and capable leader whose administration was overshadowed by his attempts to return Rome to the pre-Christian gods of tradition. He was, therefore, reviled by early Christians and Christian historians who saw his ultimate defeat in Persia as the inevitable result of his impiety. In this novel, Julian's rise and fall are recounted by his personal physician Caesarius, a staunch Christian and scientific modernist. Caesarius is a real life individual who was brother to the more famous Bishop Saint Gregory of Nazianzus.<br /><br />Julian himself rose from an insecure position as a distant relative of the emperor through banishment in various outposts of the empire to a position in Gaul in which he was able to distinguish himself as a leader and, also therefore, a potential threat. Threatened with an ultimatum, he resolved to put himself and his faithful Gallic army to the test and marches to seize Constantinople itself. Throughout his journey, he is accompanied by Caesarius who acts not just as his doctor but also his friend and, in part, his conscience. The two ultimately clash over the issue of religion as Julian's views are revealed to be other than he had professed during the reign of the previous Christian emperor. The tension between the two represents an important dynamic in the developing plot.<br /><br />This is competent historical fiction. It tells the tale it has to tell well enough and there are plenty of thrills and spills along the way, with set-piece battles, gladiatorial fights and mystical visits. However, there is a lack of depth to the characters and, perhaps just as important, something of a lack of numbers. Too few characters are developed nearly well enough - after all, the life of a soldier and emperor meant dealing with a very wide range of people and experiences. Those who are described seem to have little hinterland - they are simply the Apostate (Julian), the Christian (Caesarius), the old-fashioned doctor (Oribasius), the faithful old soldier (Sallustius) and so on. There is little real change here and little recourse to poetry, philosophy or popular culture. Indeed, it is difficult to tell what the characters eat, drink, or feel. Julian is described as an ascetic and, while this may be true, it seems that the author grasped at this fact with relief to avoid dealing with the world of senses. People go for years not only abstaining from sex but neither thinking about it or seeing other people who inspire such thoughts in them. Foreign people have few if any interesting customs or habits. Well. I could continue but the point is made.<br /><br />Having a physician as a narrator is a useful device of which much has been made in other works. It enables a scientifically-trained mind to be given access to a great leader and, hence, offers the opportunity to provide detailed analysis of the central figure. This opportunity is not fully taken here: Julian remains an enigma and, given the low level of awareness that Caesarius has of himself, this is not very surprising. Nevertheless, this is a nicely written work of historical fiction that will be of interest to those who enjoy works in this field.se who are described seem to have little hinterland - they are simply the Apostate (Julian), the Christian (Caesarius), the old-fashioned doctor (Oribasius), the faithful old soldier (Sallustius) and so on.

The author uses the historical basis of Alexander's exceptional life to create a realistic and enthralling narrative of the life of one of the world's greatest conquerors. By interweaving historical fact, educated opinion, and the author's own vivid imagination, the reign of Alexander the Great is brought to life with compelling realism.<br /><br />The novels engage the reader and powerfully recreate the world of Alexander, in much the same way as Robert Graves manages in I, Claudius. The series is remarkable in that it so completely and unnoticeably infuses the narrative of Alexander's life with ubiquitous references to historical events and practices. The reader is never left wondering at the plausibility of the plot or doubting the veracity of the historical content. The author has managed to build so naturally and believably the world and culture of the time that the novel can be read like a history or as a straight forward narrative.<br /><br />This series offers another perspective to the teaching of history but is enjoyable also simply for the engaging storyline. Extremely well written, the series powerfully recreates the life of Alexander the Great of Macedon and will immerse the reader in this ancient period.	2005-04-03

The whole plot is wrapped around the structures of power in Washington D.C. - the White House, presidential candidates, various TLAs (Three Letter Agencies), etc. NASA is some sort of collective character and not exactly one of the happiest, i'd say.<br /><br />The central point of the scenario is the discovery of a certain object buried into the ice somewhere in the Arctic zone. Typical to Brown, the discovery begins in a certain way, only to quickly reveal itself as something else entirely, which is exactly the fuel needed for the twisted plot to take off.<br /><br />For the fans of the genre, the book proves to be an entertaining read. The author is a confident master of the typical tools required to build a thriller, and the plot has more tight turns than the digestive tube of a giant herbivore. The pace of the action is extremely fast; the book is not very big, yet a lot of things happen from page one to the end. Jamesbond-ish hi-tech gadgeds are peppered all over and the author goes on and on describing self-assuredly all kinds of technologies supposedly used by the US military and special forces. A notice at the beginning of the book claims that \\"all technologies described in this novel exist.\\" It could be, even though the book certainly seems to dip its toes into sci-fi waters at times.<br /><br />Then there's the typical (for Dan Brown) ultra-super-twist of the plot when the reader is led to believe that the driving force behind some events is a certain character, only to find in amazement that it's actually someone else. Well, \\"in amazement\\" only when i read the other book; now it was kinda artificial and rather annoying.<br /><br />Also, the characters are rather sketchy, but then this is a thriller, so character development is at the very bottom of the list of priorities. It's still irritating that mature and intelligent characters use rather infantile and crude mannerisms and ways of speaking (a senior glaciologist from the U. of New Hampshire says \\"bite me\\" among her very first sentences in the book). Making the characters lively and dynamic is one thing, making them into caricatures is another matter entirely.<br /><br />Overall it's likable, for those who enjoy thrillers. But probably not the kind of book to return to after a while.nnerisms and ways of speaking (a senior glaciologist from the U. of New Hampshire says \\"bite me\\" among her very first sentences in the book).

Written by the world renowned author J.K Rowling, it is jammed packed with excitement, danger, suspense, and all the magical creatures that I have ever heard of are in this book. The book itself is more of a fantasy book that is 435 pages long in hard cover. I recommend a moderate reader to read this book. Now this book is a classic. It will go down into the history books with books like the Lord of the Rings series and the Diary of Anne Frank. The author snares the young people from the beginning with tales of magic. It is a book that both kids and adults read for fun.<br /><br />The first strength of J.K. Rowling's book is a great plot. At first, I read about Harry at his miserable home with the Dursley's. Something usually happens to the Dursley's like someone getting blown up. Then Harry goes on his trip to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after the disastrous Dursley's house incident. A traveling incident like a Dementor entering a train compartment is an example of what could happen on a seemingly ordinary train ride. Then the main sequence of the book starts with Harry arriving at Hogwart's. He and his friends uncover a mystery happening and become sleuths trying to figure it out. For instance, Harry must free his godfather from the dementors who want to kill him. Then there always is a battle or a fleeing scene at the end, which is intense. The plot itself was well written and designed.<br /><br />One of the other strengths J.K Rowling has is making the characters seem more like you. For instance, Harry is an average boy until he finds out he is a wizard. At Hogwart's he has a rival like everyone else who is always neck and neck with Harry. Malfoy, the rival, is one of the most evil characters in the book. He makes horrible remarks to Harry and challenges Harry to wizard duels. Girls can relate to Hermoine, a witch with girl problems, who is just like everyone else. In the whole book, everyone can usually relate to some character in the book by comparing their traits or thoughts.<br /><br />I would rate this book a 9 out of 10 for everything in it. I only give a 10 when the book is long but keeps interesting the whole way through the book. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a book for all ages and is one of the best books out there. It has every element that a book needs to have to keep a reader interested in. Even the school setting is one that I can relate to. Classes and teachers are something most young people deal with on a weekly basis. Rowling just added spark to these settings by incorporating wizards and magic into what is normally considered a common setting.<br /><br />I would highly recommend reading the whole series of Harry Potter books. This book is different from the other Harry Potter books because of all the magical creatures in it. For instance, there are dementors, which are grim reaper look-a-likes, and they ran ice cold chills up my spine. There are also bogarts, which are creatures that hide in closets and turn into peoples worst fears. There is much more to this book than meets the eye.

It seems that Bujold's energies are now focussed on her fantasy secondary world, centered on the Royacy of Chalion, which has certain similarities to Renaissance era Iberia. At any rate, I understand that her next novel will be another Chalionese book. This seems a good choice -- I liked both The Curse of Chalion and Paladin of Souls better than her most recent Vorkosigan book, Diplomatic Immunity.<br /><br />Paladin of Souls is the story of the Dowager Royina Ista of Chalion, mother of the new Royina Iselle, and widow of the late, cursed Roya Ias. The Curse of Chalion covered the events leading to the lifting of a terrible curse on the royal family of Chalion. Ista, who bore bravely years of living under the curse, with a terrible load of guilt and fear, as well as the burden of a loveless marriage and possession by a god which made her essentially insane, is now free of that. But her family and retainers are very protective of her -- her regained sanity remains in doubt, and she has lived a very circumscribed life. As the book opens she is chafing under what is in essence imprisonment, and she conceives the notion of a pilgrimage, ostensibly to pray for the birth of a grandson, but in reality simply to get out of her household for some time. She recruits, partly by accident, a new attendant who is actually a not very wellborn young woman named Liss,distinguished mainly by her horsemanship (she is a courier); and a priest of the Bastard to guide her pilgrimage: a young, fat, irreverent, and rather lusty fellow. She also accepts the protection of a group of soldiers led by two brothers, Ferda and Foix.<br /><br />What she had hoped would be an interesting journey rather quickly turns dangerous. There are rumors of a great outbreak of demons, and disastrously one soon possesses Ferda. Then they run into a raiding party from the neighboring princedom of Jokona, who are adherents to a (mutually) heretical form of the Chalionese religion. They are rescued by a local nobleman, a great fighter and very handsome man named Arhys. At Arhys's castle, Ista finds a very jealous wife, and a severely ill half-brother, and, worse, indications of more aggression from the Jokonans. All this is surely tied to the infestations of demons ...<br /><br />I thought it quite well done. Ista is an affecting character. The magic system/religion that Bujold has worked out remains interesting and a good source of plot conflicts.

US	14807203	R1GN0RVIM8939I	0553381393	282597222	Tides of War	Books	5	14	17	N	N	A splendid novel of Alcibiades	I very much liked Steven Pressfield's earlier historical novel Gates of Fire, which told the thrilling story of the small band of Spartans holding the pass at Thermopylae against Persian invaders in 480 B.C.  Tides of War advances the action to 430 B.C. with the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, which saw Sparta and the other city-states of Greece try to reign in the power of Athens.  His story focusses on the fortunes of Alcibiades (451-404 B.C.), the most gifted, though mercurial, leader of his day.  Alcibiades was adopted as a boy by Pericles, the great democratic leader of Athens.  By all accounts, the boy was physically beautiful, intellectually gifted and moraly unscrupulous.  He became a great disciple of Socrates, with whom he campaigned in Potidaea, but contrary to the great philosophers teachings, determined to try his hand at politics.  He became the worst kind of populist, opportunistic, demagogue--ultimately fighting for Athens three different times, but also joining the Spartans and even the Persians during periods when he had been exiled from Athens.  He was the driving force behind the ill-advised decision to try to conquer Syracuse (415-13 B.C.), which may have been the single most significant factor contributing to Athen's eventual downfall, as the Expedition proved to be a disastrous drain on men and materiel.<br /><br />Once again, Pressfield turns in an impressive performance.  He's working on a broader canvas here, but demonstrates an admirable command of history, customs, battle tactics, and multiple other subjects.  He is especially good at depicting battle scenes, with all their inextricable twining of confusion, brutality and heroism.<br /><br />I did find the narrative structure of the book to be awkward.  A grandson relates the tale that his grandfather heard from one of the men who was tried for assassinating Alcibiades.  This results in three separate narrative tracks, indicated by italics and brackets and the whole thing takes on the nature of a Rube Goldberg contraption.  Having the entire story told in the first person also makes the author's linguistic choices more noticeable, which seems like a bad idea.  Even if you're eager to suspend disbelief, you end up noticing the uneasy fit between passages that seem as if they are meant to sound somewhat archaic and others that sound like film noir banter.  It just doesn't seem like the immediacy of a first person narrator is worth all the hoops it forces author and reader to leap through.<br /><br />There is also a significant problem with the dramatic structure of the story.  For all his undeniable talent and charisma, at the end of the day Alcibiades is merely another tyrant, who put his own fortunes ahead of those of his country.  Moreover, his various plots and stratagems were responsible for the decline and fall of the world's first great democracy.  I suppose most everyone goes through a phase in youth where the Napoleons of the world seem like romantic figures--men who restore order out of chaos and bend the world to their will, however briefly.  Perhaps it's simply a sign of age that I no longer find such men sympathetic, now they just strike me as trumped up bureaucrats who think they know better than anyone else how the world should work.  I think the term that Pressfield uses is \\"necessity\\", which I guess he derives from the historical record, Alcibiades always thinks he knows what is necessary at any given moment.  If the intervening 2400 years have taught us anything, it is that one man, or group of men, never know what is necessary; they merely impose their own vision on a typically unwilling populace with predictably disastrous results, as here.<br /><br />In fact, I found the story most effective as a cautionary tale of the dangers inherent in depending on charismatic leadership and of trying to make direct democracy work.  In I. F. Stone's book The Trial of Socrates, he tries to reconcile his own veneration of Athenian-style democracy with the, to him, inexplicable decision to execute the great philosopher.  But the great lesson of that episode and of the career of Alcibiades is that the polity of such a democracy is \\"a beast needing to be fed\\", driven by emotion and envy, not an enlightened and rational body.  The unfettered citizenry of Athens is really pretty scary and men like Alcibiades, who would exploit the baser instincts (in particular, the imperial pretensions) of the beast for personal gain, can in no wise be considered heroes, however bold and fascinating they may be.<br /><br />Despite these concerns, I do strongly recommend the book.  One of the great deficits of the modern education is how little we learn of Greek and Roman Civilization.  Books like this one, which help to fill the gaps, and do it in a lively and accessible way, are invaluable.  I don't much like Alcibiades, but I certainly enjoyed reading about him.icable decision to execute the great philosopher.

US	14807203	R3VXZZSEB30PIC	0140367470	839463326	The Three Musketeers (Puffin Classics)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Romance, heroism, adventure:The three musketers	A few months ago I was in the mood to read a good classic, and stumbled across Alexander Dumas' famous narrative The Three Musketeers in a bookstore.<br /><br />This story has everything you would ever want: romance, camaraderie, heroism, and, above all, adventure.<br /><br />D'Artagnan is a young boy who dreams of becoming a famous musketeer (the soldiers who protect the king of France in the 17th century). Along the way to achieving this dream, he finds, in Paris, the musketeers disbanded by the evil Cardinal who hopes to undermine the King's reign and rule France on his own. With the help of three famous Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, D'Artagnan fights to protect the King and his throne.<br /><br />The Three Musketeers is written with such eloquence and style that it is obvious why it has gone down in history as a distinguished novel. The sword fights are described with such magic that you feel you are standing with Athos and Porthos to fight the Cardinal's guards.<br /><br />As a hopeless romantic, I am always looking for a great romance. So if there is one negative, it would be the love story. I don't want to give away the ending. But as an avid reader of Jane Austen, if the lovers don't end up happy and together, I finish the book feeling unfulfilled. Dumas does, however, compensate with the wonderful relationship of the band of musketeers. Even though in the end they follow their own paths, you know they will always be able to rely on each other.<br /><br />In all other regards, The Three Musketeers is excellent. It leaves you exhilarated and reminds you that true friends come together in troubled times.	2005-04-01

Rowling pens her next delightful tome. Many readers have re-discovered the classic stories about the magical land of Narnia, authored by C. S. Lewis. This large and beautiful volume collects all of the books in the series: The Magician's Nephew, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle. The books appear in the order for which C. S. Lewis himself expressed a slight preference, although he was later quoted as saying that it didn't really matter which order the books were read. The books can be read on several levels. On a surface level which children will see, they are tales of English children who get to visit a fantastic land known as Narnia. Narnia is full of talking animals, villains, heroes, witches and adventures, and is ruled over by the high king, Aslan, who appears as a giant lion.<br /><br />Adults will see the Christian theology which underlies the books, although the Christian ideals form only an underpinning of the stories rather than an \\"in your face\\" religious treatise; this is certainly not what most would call a straight \\"Christian\\" series -- far from it. For one thing, there is far too much magic, astrology and the like to satisfy the extremists who seem to have so many problems with the Harry Potter series. You'll see as much of the Christian theology as you bring with you to your reading experience, and those with no religious background will likely miss the symbolism entirely -- with no detraction from the story whatsoever. Certainly, good triumphing over evil is a common theme which appears in most fantasy novels in one form or another. And to focus on this debate misses the point of the books entirely: they are meant to entertain. And entertain they do, amazingly so, considering the fact that they were written nearly 50 years ago.	2005-04-01
US	14807203	R3LAAQOJQ7MH7C	0312275390	679535408	The Last King: Rome's Greatest Enemy	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Rome's greatest enemy: Mithridates	In first century BC, the Roman Senate declared King Mithridates Eupator VI of Pontus (on the Black Sea) as its greatest enemy. Rome had turned Pontus into a satellite state when Mithridates' mother ruled. When he became the monarch, his country was totally reliant on Rome. Instead of bowing like his mom, he launches campaigns often brutal to throw Rome out of his country and the rest of Asia Minor. Over the next four decades starting at home, Mithridates ruled and warred. First he exploited the weaknesses of his mother ultimately overthrowing her; then he challenged the puppeteers of the Roman Republic using anything in his genocidal arsenal to make a point. Finally after forty years of battles, retreats, and more war, he met final defeat at the hands of General Pompey. Even then he refused to bow having his men execute him instead of allowing the Romans to parade him as a trophy.<br /><br />This is a fabulous historical fiction novel that provides deep insight into the Ancient Roman world through one of its toughest enemies. Many readers like this reviewer probably never heard of Mithridates before, but he obviously proved to be a dangerous long term threat to the Romans. Though the depth in which Michael Curtis Ford provides military tactics seems overwhelming to the lay-person, it also furbishes a sense of how brilliant Rome's Greatest Enemy truly was. The tactics also lead to fantastic descriptions of the battles as the audience get a first hand account (narrated by the lead protagonist's son) of life in the BC Roman Empire from the perspective of those who wanted out from the glory.	2005-04-01

Never able to completely subdue the barbarians from the north, the Romans built Hadrian's Wall in the second century, to separate the Roman part of Britain from the Celts, who threatened from the north. Spanning over seventy miles, the wall was a marvel of engineering and military prowess. William Dietrich uses this backdrop for his gripping new historical novel. Draco, an inspector for Rome, has been sent to Hadrian's Wall in northern Britannia to investigate a major uprising and invasion. The story of what really happened unfolds as Draco's investigation proceeds.<br /><br /> William Dietrich combines intrigue, adventure, politics and romance to create a fascinating portrait of life in the fourth century. Using the character of Draco, the investigator looking into the violent events that occurred at the Wall, Dietrich skillfully spins a story that is so absorbing that you won't be able to put the book down. The richly layered characters - the complex Valeria, the fury-filled, revenge-seeking Galba, the ambitious Flavius and the introspective narrator, Draco - are all brought vividly to life by Dietrich's tightly-written, crisp prose. The battle scenes are gruesomely authentic and not in the least bit romanticized; the reader is thrust right into the middle of the battlefield, with screaming, naked barbarians hacking at opponents with battleaxes and Roman legionnaires swinging deadly swords. This is a sweeping and powerful historical novel, filled with political intrigue, action and romance.	2005-04-01
US	14807203	R2HRPNPRVMHJHX	1590710207	309083352	Eagle in the Snow	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Maximus to the rescue	In A.D. 406, as Germanic tribes tried to cross into Gaul, the Rhine froze at Moguntiacum (Mainz), which it had not done for centuries. The narrator, the fictional General Paulinus Gaius Maximus, must stop the barbarians, and the ingenious ways he tries to achieve this and the bravery he and his men show forms the heart of the story. Breem's vivid battle descriptions provide a picture of a man attempting to prevent a human tidal wave from overwhelming the Roman Empire, from the Rhine to Rome.<br /><br />This may recall the opening scene of the film Gladiator, in which an idealistic Roman general named Maximus battles hordes of Germans along the Rhine. In fact, the decision to reissue this long out-of-print novel, considered by many a must-read of Roman historical fiction, was made after the film's success.<br /><br />Breem has a lilting prose style: \\"They could not reach us across the ditches, but their axes could, and men who had been holding shields all day grew tired, till they could hold them no longer, and then they had no need to.\\" But problems arise when the work attempts to be both literary and historical.<br /><br />The only developed characters are Maximus and his right-hand man, Quintus Veronius. A few historical characters are distinctive, but other officers or barbarian leaders are too sketchy and require frequent resort to the List of Principal Characters. Theme is equally simple: that a man of sufficient honor will sacrifice himself and those around him for an ideal of Rome, a city he has never seen.<br /><br />Eagle in the Snow is a good place to start for anyone who wants to imagine life at the time Rome was starting to collapse. It has great battle scenes and a likable, honorable narrator. Despite some slow sections and a few historical and literary lapses, it is a serious novel set in a turbulent time.	2005-04-01
