The urge to empathy produces art that draws us out of ourselves \\"into\\" that depicted by art, whereas the urge to abstraction is to escape the caprices of nature by creating a Platonic ideal that is incorruptible - a drive well captured by Einstein in this quote:<br /><br />\\"Man seeks for himself, in whatever manner is suitable for him, a simplified and lucid image of the world, and so to overcome the world of  experience by striving to replace it to some extent by this image.<br /><br />This is what the painter does, and the poet, the speculative philosopher, the natural scientist, each in his own way.  Into this image and its formation, he places the centre of gravity of his emotional life, in order to attain the peace and serenity that he cannot find within the narrow confines of swirling, personal experience.\\"<br /><br />The philosopher Charles Taylor (in The Malaise of Modernity) has described the turn in art from that of 'mimesis' (the drive to empathy) to 'creation' (the drive to abstraction) that occurred at the onset of modernity.  Another book that throws light on the drive to abstraction is John Dewey's The Quest for Certainty.<br /><br />In this book Frank set out to show how the classics of literary modernism are the exact equivalent of the developments in the modern arts, of the urge to abstraction, shown especially in the elimination of space - the work is no longer historically situated, voices are fragmented, alienated; \\"Time is no longer felt as an objective, causal progression with clearly marked-out differences between periods; now it has become a continuum in which distinctions between past and present are wiped out\\" (think James Joyce).<br /><br />Seminal reading	2005-05-16

While Buber uses poetic language, those interested in seeing an alternate, more philosophical rigorous working out of these ideas should look at the neglected work of the Scottish philosopher John Macmurray (1891-1976).<br /><br />Macmurray firstly proposes action, and not thought, as the fundamental basis for understanding what it is to be human. When Descartes says \\"I think\\", he is then already divorced from the world. One can ONLY exist in interaction with others and other things, it is absurd to imagine a person as existing in a universe where there is nothing else whatsoever. Action is the full state of the human being, and thinking is a lesser, abstracted state. Action is a full concrete activity of the Self employing all our capacities whereas thought is constituted by the exclusion of some of our powers and a WITHDRAWAL into an activity which is less concrete and less complex... a theory of knowledge is derived from and included in a theory of action.<br /><br />Secondly, Macmurray proposes another enormous paradigm shift for Western philosophy by saying that we cannot fully understand individuals in isolation, but only in relation to others. Relationship is constitutive of human living for Macmurray: 'We need one another to be ourselves. This complete and unlimited dependence of each of us upon the others is the central and crucial fact of personal existence.' The idea of an isolated agent is self-contradictory; any agent is necessarily in relationship with Others. Macmurray corresponded with Martin Buber, and his thought essentially extends Buber's vision.<br /><br />These two central tenets are explicated respectively in Macmurray's two major works, \\"The Self as Agent\\" and \\"Persons in Relation\\" (also published together as \\"The Form of the Personal\\"). Macmurray's writing is crystal clear, and filled with other fascinating points, such as his distinction between intellectual and emotional representations, in chapter 9 of \\"The Self as Agent\\".<br /><br />A great short introduction to Macmurray and his work can be found in David Creamer's book \\"Guides to the Journey\\".ther fascinating points, such as his distinction between intellectual and emotional representations, in chapter 9 of \\"The Self as Agent\\". <br /> <br />A great short introduction to Macmurray and his work can be found in David Creamer's book \\"Guides to the Journey\\".	2004-08-19

(If you haven't discovered Lonergan's thought yet, let me encourage you to do so - whet your appetite at the Bernard Lonergan Web Site...by reading the Introduction to 'The Lonergan Reader' - and then buy Guides to the Journey).<br />Even more exciting was discovering the thought of John Macmurray, the first thinker that Creamer profiles. (The book consists of two chapters for each thinker - one an introduction to their life, and the second to their ideas, and concludes with a chapter exploring common themes).<br />Macmurray firstly proposes action, and not thought, as the fundamental basis for understanding what it is to be human.

So in the chapter on Emotional Formation, he spends time briefly reviewing traditional emotion theories, from Aquinas through phenomenological approaches to cognitive behaviorism, before settling on the cognitive interaction theory of emotions as the foundation for the rest of the chapter.  As promised, there is a rich mix of empiricial research findings with provocative ideas from philosophers from Plato to Ricouer.  The writing is at all times clear and accessible (I am a layman in this area).<br />The last chapter weaves together a retrieval of classical theories of character with a narrative approach to a dynamic understanding of character, and was worth the price of the book alone.

Christianity places God and His purposes at the centre of the universe.

They have consciously chosen this culture on the grounds that the Victorian age was the last truly viable form of civilization.  Needless to say of Stephenson, this is only one intriguing idea out of a broad palette of stunning perspectives.	2001-06-08

However hard it is to get a copy, it is MUST reading for anyone involved in educating people.  Heavily influenced by McLuhan, this book is devastating in showing what classrooms REALLY teach - that there is one right answer, that the teacher has it, that memorising facts is important, that fellow students have nothing to contribute, etc etc - and how to construct an environment in which REAL learning takes place - where people learn how to learn themselves.  This is one of those books that shakes one's previously-unexamined foundational assumptions of education.  I cannot recommend it too highly.	2001-06-08

This is an amazing book.  After I read it, I ordered some extra copis,thinking I might give them out over the next few years to parents ofcertain kids (I do youth work in my church.)  Well, I lent one copy toa mother, and within three or four weeks had sold all my copies topeople in my small town, who had heard about it by word of mouth.I've now donated a copy to our local library!	2001-01-26

Nonetheless, in twenty years of reading in this area, the ideas in this book still stand out for me as the most powerful guide to breakthrough  thinking that I've encountered.  Despite the poor writing, this book is  outstanding.	2000-07-28

A lot of hard-won,  unconventional wisdom is in these pages.  I have read the book several  times.	1999-06-17

Highly recommended!	1999-05-03
