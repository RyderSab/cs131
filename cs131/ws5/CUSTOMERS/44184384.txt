This book attempts to provide a point of view which even faults philosophy for its view of morality.<br /><br />Bakhtin begins his critique of Kant's reliance on imperatives and moral norms from this very point:  a sense of obligation or \\"oughtness\\" (dolzhestvovanie) must be grounded in the concrete instance, not in the general rule or the abstractly hypothetical situation.  Bakhtin even insists at one point that there are \\"no moral norms signifying in themselves,\\" but only the \\"moral subject with his specific structuring . . . upon which one must rely\\" (KFP, p. 85).  (p. 69).<br /><br />But even the great Kant only gets four lines on page 515 in the Index (pp. 501-530) of this book about Mikhail Bakhtin, far less than the lines devoted to entries for Carnival, Chronotope, Creativity, Dialogue, Dostoevsky, Double-voicing, Ethics, Form-shaping ideology (force, impulse), Freud, Future and futurity, Genre, Global concepts, Heteroglossia, Historicity, Hybrids, Image of a person, Inner speech, Interpretation, Intonation and tone, Laughter, Literary history, Marx, Memory, Monologic and monologism, Novels, Outsideness, Parody, Past and pastness, Plot, Poetry, Polyphony, Potential, Present and presentness, Privacy and private life, Prosaics, Psychology as discipline, Rabelais, Reaccentuation and accentuation, Relativism, Responsibility, Self and psyche, Space, Speech genres, Structuralism and structure, Style, System, Task or project, Testing of a hero, Testing of a language or genre:  of style in double-voiced discourse, Theoretism, Third person:  as superaddressee, Time, Tolstoy, Truth, Unfinalizability, Unity, Utopianism and anti-utopianism, Utterance, Value and evaluation, Voice and voicing, Voloshinov, Wholeness, and Word.<br /><br />On the only page which mentions Nietzsche, he is considered symptomatic of the mistake made by anyone who apotheosizes philosophers:<br /><br />The major philosophical challenge of our time, Bakhtin writes, is not to appreciate the abstract value of time, space, or morality, but to resist the temptations of the theoretical and abstract.  One must rescue the \\"I\\" from the realm of infinite and purely abstract meaning--what Bakhtin calls the world of cognition--and so free it for genuine responsibility (otvetstvennost').  What is most important about a given act, then, is the fact that I \\"sign\\" it.  Bakhtin insists that this concept, if properly understood, is neither solipsistic nor selfish; Nietzsche's big mistake, in fact, was to assume that living from oneself meant living for oneself (KFP, p. 119).  Signing an act does not mean accepting all blame or assuming absolute control over it.  Rather, signing is that indispensable enabling gesture that makes it possible for morality to coalesce around a human being, in what Bakhtin calls the \\"architectonics\\" of a life.  The abstract and \\"projective\\" side of things, which theorists identify . . .  (p. 69).<br /><br />Scholastic discussions of philosophical texts treat ideas like abstractions which make the ideal Platonic forms more important than human potential to accomplish anything, which philosophers have rarely been inspired to attempt.  Heidegger's support for Hitler is widely considered an example of how erroneously a thinker in a confusing place and time is likely to apply human needs to justify going off on the wrong track by attempting to work within a destructive system, but this book is more concerned with the situation in the Stalinist Soviet Union or even in the book WAR AND PEACE.  In the explanation of abbreviations, KFP stands for \\"K filosofii postupka\\" [Toward a philosophy of the act].  (p. xviii).

Nevertheless, when I had the opportunity to acquire the 1990 Encyclopedia Britannica edition of GREAT BOOKS Volume 39, KANT, in new condition, at a price that seemed reasonable for someone with my limited means, I pondered the seven titles in the General Contents, tried to remember if Meiklejohn, Abbott, Hastie, and James Creed Meredith were translators that I had encountered elsewhere, and purchased this book for something to check when Schopenhauer expressed so much enthusiasm for Kant that I had to look and see if Kant could really be that good.  As an aside, when I discovered that a new translation of Witold Gombrowicz's last work, which I have in a translation called PHILOSOPHY IN SIX LESSONS AND A QUARTER, I checked my copy and discovered that Kant was the main topic of First Lesson, Sunday, 27 April 1969, Second Lesson, Monday, 28 April 1969, and Third Lesson, 30 April 1969; it hardly seemed worth spending another six hours and fifteen minutes on Gombrowicz's philosophy if I did not have the foundation in Kant.<br /><br />Schopenhauer read widely in Kant's works, and an Appendix to the first volume of his THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION (translated by E. F. J. Payne, Vol. I, pp. 413-534, which ends with a reference to another essay on Kant in PARERGA AND PARALIPOMENA published years later) treated Kant as harshly as no one should confront a living person, \\"since human frailty cannot endure even the most just refutation of an error, unless it is tempered by soothing and flattery, and hardly even then; . . . but the man who is dead has cast this weakness aside;\\"  (Schopenhauer, WWR I, p. 417).  How well does GREAT BOOKS 39 KANT correspond to what Schopenhauer's Appendix has to say about Kant?  The only page numbers in GREAT BOOKS are for i - xi and pp. 1- 613 for the contents.  E.F.J. Payne gives German page numbers, which do not help, except that Schopenhauer is usually clear about which book and section of Kant he is drawing from, so frequent comparisons can be made.  For example, Schopenhauer on page 438 moves from a discussion of the Transcendental Aesthetic to \\"At the very beginning of the Transcendental Logic (CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, p. 50; V, 74)\\" he is clearly referring to the page in GREAT BOOKS 39 KANT that is page 34.  Instead of sorting the things on this page out clearly, Schopenhauer expresses that \\"Through the whole of this, the utter confusion of the representation of perception with the abstract representation tends to an abstract cross between the two, which he describes as the object of knowledge through the understanding and its categories, and this knowledge he calls experience.\\"  (p. 439).  What Schopenhauer thought Kant wrote was:<br /><br />\\"Through the first an object is given to us, through the second it is thought.\\"  (p. 438).<br /><br />The idea in GREAT BOOKS 39 KANT is expressed as:<br /><br />\\"Through the first an object is given to us; through the second, it is, in relation to the representation (which is a mere determination of the mind), thought.\\"  (p. 34).<br /><br />Gombrowicz starts with an earlier version of this problem.  \\"Descartes reduces these three elements of cognition.\\"  Gombrowicz also mentions the First Part:  Transcendental Aesthetics, but calls the Second Part:  Transcendental Analytics, and Third Part:  Transcendental Dialectics, which appear in GREAT BOOKS 39 KANT as the first division and second division of the Second Part:  Transcendental Logic.  There are spelling errors in my copy of Gombrowicz which lead me to believe that numerous people know very little about the finer points of Kant's breakthrough philosophical work, CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, but that is not surprising.  Even Gombrowicz thought:<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />It has been demonstrated that Kant's apriori synthetic judgments are in reality analytical judgments.<br /><br />This magnificent edifice is crumbling.<br /><br />And Kant's idea of the categories of reason is going to collapse, too.  (Gombrowicz, p. 26).<br /><br />Gombrowicz's Fourth and Fifth Lessons were primarily about Schopenhauer.  Then the Sixth Lesson, 3 May takes Hegel, calls his THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF MIND, Volume II, important for Chapter VI. on \\"The true ethical mind is divided into two parts:  the ethical world, the human and the divine world, and man and woman.\\"  (Gombrowicz, p. 51).<br /><br />Kant is still mentioned a few more times, most notably near the end of the book:<br /><br />\\"Nietzsche, like Kant and Schopenhauer, was Polish !\\"  (Gombrowicz, p. 93).<br /><br />Though GREAT BOOKS 39 KANT has seven works, I have not had the opportunity to compare any of them with another translation, though the translation of THE CRITIQUE OF JUDGEMENT by J. H. Bernard might be more popular than James Creed Meredith's version in this book.  Schopenhauer highly praises Kant's PROLEGOMENA TO ANY FUTURE METAPHYSICS, which I have in a 1977 printing of a 1950 version edited by Lewis White Beck, which has an index listing Aristotle, Berkeley, Descartes, Euclid, Hume, Locke, etc.  Though GREAT BOOKS 39 KANT has works called FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE METAPHYSICS OF MORALS (1785) and PREFACE AND INTRODUCTION TO THE METAPHYSICAL ELEMENTS OF ETHICS, WITH A NOTE ON CONSCIENCE, and GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS, and THE SCIENCE OF RIGHT, it does not have the Prolegomena, and it does not have an index.priori synthetic judgments are in reality analytical judgments.<br /><br />This magnificent edifice is crumbling.<br /><br />And Kant's idea of the categories of reason is going to collapse, too.

It implies that a global hyperpower is capable of winning every contest by flexing it's overly military muscle, if only everyone and the newspapers they read could participate wholeheartedly whenever other portions of the world deserve a thorough pounding.  Even with the obvious bias that the logic of winning by overwhelming force should be observed in Republican presidents, while the Democrats have been hopelessly conflicted by other considerations which tie one or both of their hands behind their backs, which is the political slant that motivates most of the historical observations in this work, the humor which this book contains deserves as much consideration as the historical facts that such humor is based on.  As a reviewer who rarely claims to be a self-proclaimed Freudian expert in the humor of the Vietnam war, and philosophical alter ego of Nietzsche's translator Professor Walter Kaufmann (1921-1980), who thought that Israel ought to get some credit for being far more threatened by its enemies than a triumphant America could ever be, I might seem a bit timid if I did not try to tackle the thoughts in this book.  It has a great index, listing many people that I remember reading about, but the index does not have an entry for credibility gap, which should be just before Cronkite, Walter, Crossfire (TV), and Crow, Sheryl.  To counter Sheryl Crow's view that the \\"best way to solve problems is to not have enemies\\" (p. 248), Ann Coulter lets us know:<br /><br />War solves that problem, too:  We won't have any enemies because we are going to kill them.  Crow warned of \\"huge karmic retributions that will follow.\\"  She seemed not to understand that America going to war is the huge karmic retribution.  They killed three thousand Americans and now they're going to die.  (pp. 248-249).<br /><br />I remember reading something in this book about the brilliant economist and columnist Paul Krugman, on the intellectual end of the spectrum, where complexity has more appeal than simple crash and burn.  Ann Coulter is capable of reflecting the complexity of historical situations:<br /><br />Johnson's pain at U.S. casualties was not so great as to distract from his real love--creating comically useless federal welfare programs.  In the middle of the Vietnam war, for the first time in U.S. history, welfare spending would exceed defense spending.  You can't get Democrats to concentrate on national defense even when they have taken the country to war.  In a reprise of liberal Attention Deficit Disorder, on January 29, 2002, five months after terrorists leveled the World Trade Center, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote, \\"I predict that in the years ahead Enron, not Sept. 11, will come to be seen as the greater turning point in U.S. society.\\"  (p. 129).<br /><br />Funny me, I just saw a movie called \\"Enron:  the Smartest Guys in the Room\\" yesterday, and some of the language reminded me of parts of MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK that no self-respecting philosophy publisher would print, but in the movie, it was in the subtitles, right along with \\"Burn, baby, burn.\\"  Enron's credibility gap turned into a bankruptcy, investigation, obstruction of justice conviction, and many criminal fraud charges before it was a Simpsons' cartoon roller coaster ride to the poorhouse in the \\"Enron\\" movie.  It spent too much time on people who did not get as rich at Enron as a top executive who might still have $350 million dollars in the bank, possibly legally, if the Statute of Limitations means anything.<br /><br />LBJ's efforts to fight a limited war in Nam get little support in this book.  \\"In an amazing coincidence, the most powerful nation on earth seems to go to war against unbeatable adversaries only when a Democrat is president.\\"  (p. 130).  Goldwater could have won.  \\"More likely, the North Vietnamese would have reacted the way the Iranian hostage-takers did when Reagan was elected, immediately releasing their American hostages the very day of his inauguration.\\"  (p. 133).  The credibility gap showed up again soon after Sept. 11:<br /><br />On November 4, 2001, Los Angeles Times columnist Jacob Heilbrunn said, \\"The United States is not headed into a quagmire; it's already in one.  The U.S. is not losing the first round against the Taliban; it has already lost it.  Soon, a new credibility gap will emerge as the Pentagon attempts to massage the news.\\"  (pp. 133-134).<br /><br />Battles tend to produce victories that require years of mopping up afterwards, and Nam has become the paradigm for the unpopularity of wars that America is not fighting anymore, as 30 years ago the Communists were able to kick the Americans out of Nam; though the United States hardly ever tried to kick anyone out of Nam except reporters who couldn't adhere to certain guidelines.  Books like this tend to remind me of the limitations that I face, in those situations where philosophically going through the roof is not considered an option.<br /><br />As an engineer, I used to work on a great man-made river project for Libya, so I was interested in all the reasons why I couldn't work for them anymore while the following episode occurred:<br /><br />After Libyan agents set off bombs in a West Berlin discotheque frequented by American servicemen in April 1986, Reagan retaliated with air strikes against Qaddafi's living quarters, missing Qaddafi, but killing his daughter.  The Americans hit military targets in Tripoli and Benghazi.  Our \\"allies,\\" the French, denied America use of its airspace for the attack.  Tired from the long flights and showing a puckish sense of humor, the pilots bombed the French embassy by accident.  Pow!  So sorry, our mistake.\\"  (pp. 143-144).<br /><br />Surprisingly, the funniest parts of this book strike me as being true.  Most history is quickly forgotten, but things like that which happen over again a few times in each century, or once a decade if you are paying attention, ought to stick in your mind as surely as the question, can such things be?n hostages the very day of his inauguration.\\"  (p. 133).

Part of the humor of MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK was the obviously mistaken belief that an American intelligentsia must be keeping track of nasty activities undertaken by the world's superpowers to make sure that the balance implied by the idea of a world moral order would never become too incredibly out of line for reasonable suggestions to be offered without the kind of wild accusations that float freely in courts, newspapers, UN debates, and political books of this nature, but the rejection slips kept telling me that such a long-term psychological problem couldn't really be this funny.<br /><br />The Anti Chomsky Reader edited by Peter Collier and David Horowitz (2004) is so pro-American in its political outlook, hyped on fear of every enemy in a curveball tradition that fails to acknowledge how secret crazy activities can be appropriate topics for comedy, particularly as electric wires and naked enemy prisoners in pyramids have become the pictures most likely to be imagined by readers of the assertion:<br /><br />`According to Chomsky, there is \\"a close correlation worldwide between torture and U.S. aid. . . .  The degree of cruelty is quite astonishing.\\" ' (p. 184, in Chapter 7, Noam Chomsky's Anti-American Obsession, quoting WHAT UNCLE SAM REALLY WANTS (1992)).<br /><br />The perfect American counter-argument presented in this book shows how a wartime economic regimentation of a poor country can provide material benefits for its people:<br /><br />\\"For fifty years, supposedly nefarious American business interests and self-interested investors have operated freely in South Korea.  The results are interesting.  In 1950, South Korea had a per capita income of $250 and was as poor as Cuba or Vietnam.  Today, South Korea is an industrial power and its per capita income is $8490, more than thirty times greater than it was before it became an ally and investment region of the United States (or, as Chomsky would insist, an exploited `neo-colony' of American capitalism).  Meanwhile, per capita income in isolated (Communist) Vietnam is $370, not much more than it was half a century ago.\\"  (p. 194).<br /><br />Unfortunately, current fiscal policies might also make the per capita income of China thirty times greater in fifty years than it is today, while people who have to work until 70 to retire in the United States half a century from now might be lucky to get the current minimum wage for their efforts.  Trade has become a device for exporting wealth to countries which can provide cheap labor for productive activities, mostly manufacturing, but technology experts in India might be able to provide what the Chinese can't do in the future.  America has high hopes to benefit from its financial strings on the world's economy, but the ability to realize profits in a capitalistic system in a climate of diminishing returns is becoming a political secular religion, as religious in the devotion required politically for those who would agree with the authors of this book, as they express their opposition to Marx's strange pipe dream about religion which shows up in this book like a bone thrown to a dog:<br /><br />\\"The illusion that socialism promises a better future is not only the cause of mass poverty and death in the countries seduced by its followers, it is also the cause of the Chomsky cult.  It is the illusion itself, the messianic hope that impassions the `progressive' Left.  This hope is a chimera, and it creates a worldview that is strictly Manichean.  Those who oppose socialism, Marxism, Communism, Chomskyism embody evil; they are the party of Satan, and their champion, America, is the Great Satan himself.  Chomskyism is, like its models, a religion of social hatred.\\"  (p. 197).<br /><br />Undoubtedly 100 million people died during the twentieth century, asthese issues were being fought about by millions who never had the opportunity to retire on a steady stream of income with free health care, bread, and circuses, but as entertainment, it was quite a circus.  Even religions of hatred seem to appeal to groups that do not qualify for extremely generous benefits as things now stand, and only get worse every time their adherents see the Great Satan try to make them a better offer.  Strangely enough, in THE ANTICHRIST, Nietzsche identified a religion that did not have such negative characteristics:<br /><br />\\"Buddhism is a hundred times more realistic than Christianity:  posing problems objectively and coolly is part of its inheritance, for Buddhism comes after a philosophic movement that spanned centuries.  The concept of `God' had long been disposed of when it arrived.  Buddhism is the only genuinely positivistic religion in history.  This applies even to its theory of knowledge (a strict phenomenalism):  it no longer says `struggle against sin' but, duly respectful of reality, `struggle against suffering.'  Buddhism is profoundly distinguished from Christianity by the fact that the self-deception of the moral concepts lies far behind it.  In my terms, it stands beyond good and evil.\\"  (THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, pp. 586-587).<br /><br />Noam Chomsky might not be quite as *good* as the Buddha, but he is hardly trying to conquer the world with secret agents overthrowing governments, as Diem was terminated in Saigon on November 1, 1963 by generals who expected American aid to continue as long as the Vietnamese army could fight the Communists who occupied their country, half-country, or whatever ground freedom chose to claim in the future.  The New Vietnam War Comedy Joke Book could have a few chapters on how the ideas in this book relate back to then; the same psywar tactics practiced by the American intelligentsia fit 1950 better than they will fit 2050 for non-millionaires.

They are continuous parts of a scan that is 12 inches tall and about 36 inches long, including the flaps in the front and back covers.  The body of the moth is not clear along the spine of the book, but the light hairs extending an inch or more from dark shoulder pads are similar to the pattern of Grammia virgo on Plate 18.  This print of the entire moth measures six and a half inches between spots that are shown on the inner flaps, so the cover must be zooming in with a power of five on the size of a full page moth in this book.  The virgin tiger moth shown in the tiny version of that scan on page 110 has a wingspan of 6.2 cm.  It is amazing how intense the colors become as the picture is electronically exploded to twenty-five times actual size, and fine red hairs can be seen crossing yellow wing membrane.<br /><br />On Plate 18, the antennae curve like an antelope's antler, with tiny offshoots like eyelashes.  The wings look as fuzzy as moths are expected to be, with fine hairs projecting into the space between the wings and the body.  The long cover scan is so well focused on the hairs at the glass of the scanner that the gap between body and wing is hardly noticeable, except on the back cover, where distinct hairs over a white background approach the rounded red shape of the moth's body.  The intricate parts of the wings look flaky, but the scanning technique emphasizes the shapes and colors of discrete objects on the surface of the glass much more than how three-dimensional anything is.  Legs might be blurry, as in plate 43, Magusa orbifera, or extremely hairy when they are featured, as on plate 44, Zanclognatha laevigata, looking like a combination of feathers and spiky thorns.<br /><br />Weird is the 11 and 1/2 by 18 inch scan of Geina tenuidactyla on plate 59, which looks like it has five or six feathers on each side, striped curvy antennae, and legs with long spines at the joints.

US	44184384	RCWUOMN3J7U1X	0631139664	424783940	View from Afar	Books	5	6	12	N	N	The dynamics of competing mythologies explained	I am a neophyte interpreter of Claude Levi-Strauss.  When I took Anthropology (Introduction to Primitive Cultures) at the University of Michigan for the spring half-semester in 1967, my grade was a B.  The dictionary's definition of neophyte is primarily religious, dating back to the primitive church, from Greek and Late Latin terms that modified what was newly planted in Greek.  People who read THE VIEW FROM AFAR ought to expect their interest in words, myth, and the aura of insanity to be increased, particularly by Part III:  The Environment and Its Representation:<br /><br />Chapter 7  Structuralism and Ecology<br /><br />Chapter 8  Structuralism and Empiricism<br /><br />Chapter 9  The Lessons of Linguistics<br /><br />Chapter 10  Religion, Language, and History:  Concerning an Unpublished Text by Ferdinand de Saussure<br /><br />Chapter 11  From Mythical Possibility to Social Existence<br /><br />Part IV  Beliefs, Myths, and Rites starts with Chapter 12  Cosmopolitanism and Schizophrenia.  I am not totally unfamiliar with some concepts in this book, due to the feeling that I have had for a long time that when you go someplace new, the first person that you talk to is likely to be the village idiot.  Intellectuals may attempt to avoid this problem by going first to works of people who have pristine reputations, pre-Platonic philosophers or leaders in their fields.  Claude Levi-Strauss might be the pre-eminent name in French anthropology, but I am surprised how many links with American natives and educated society are revealed in THE VIEW FROM AFAR.  Chapter 9 is a preface for the French translation of SIX LECTURES ON SOUND AND MEANING by Roman Jakobson, who died in 1982 at the age of 86.  The lectures \\"were the first ones that I heard him give\\" (p. 138).  Jakobson and Levi-Strauss attended each other's courses in New York during the 1942-43 year, when Levi-Strauss was teaching at Barnard.  Chapter 21, New York in 1941, also contains a description of \\"Between 1946 and 1947, when I was cultural adviser to the French embassy, I would be visited by intermediaries carrying attach&eacute; cases full of pre-Columbian gold jewelry.\\"  (pp. 261-262).<br /><br />\\"I felt myself going back in time no less when I went to work every morning in the American room of the New York Public Library.  There, under its neo-classical arcades and between walls paneled with old oak, I sat near an Indian in a feather headdress and a beaded buckskin jacket--who was taking notes with a Parker pen.\\"  (pp. 266-267).<br /><br />THE VIEW FROM AFAR was originally published in French in 1983, and the English edition from Basic Books, Inc. in 1985.  It might be considered a continuation of the volumes of STRUCTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY which appeared in France in 1958 and 1973, but Levi-Strauss would prefer that he be considered older now.  \\"Imitating a stretto, I devoted the little time available to touching rapidly on the major themes that have been the focus of my research--kinship, social organization, mythology, ritual, art--at the slower pace than was now permissible.\\"  (p. xi).  Possibly we are even slower now, trying to figure out which fugue has close overlapping voices, each beginning very shortly after the preceding one, often in the final section of the fugue.<br /><br />The stretto idea of competing themes is most interesting in trying to combine the schizoid multiplicity of perspectives that this book presents.  Chapter 1, Race and Culture, is a public lecture delivered in 1971 for UNESCO that is distinct from \\"Race and History\\" which Levi-Strauss wrote for UNESCO twenty years earlier.  In the Preface, he admits, \\"But twenty years earlier, in order to serve the international institutions, which I felt I had to support more than I do today, I had somewhat overstated my point\\" (p. xiii) which had become such a shibboleth among workers at UNESCO in 1971, \\"who were dismayed that I had challenged a catechism that was for them all the more an article of faithbecause their acceptance of it--achieved at the price of laudable efforts that flew in the face of their local traditions and social milieus--had allowed them to move from modest jobs in developing countries to sanctified positions as executives in an international institution.\\"  (p. xiii).  How bad was it?<br /><br />\\"When I pointed out that geneticists have blown a blast of fresh air into the discussion, I was accused of putting the fox in the sheepfold.\\"  (p. xiv).<br /><br />\\"Cultures are not unaware of one another, they even borrow from one another on occasion; but, in order not to perish, they must, in other connections, remain somewhat impermeable toward one another.\\"  (pp. xiv-xv).<br /><br />\\"This verbal bombast ...\\"  (p. xv).<br /><br />\\"Fourth, since it seemed necessary, I warned that it is not enough to revel in high-flown words year after year if they wished to change humanity.  Finally, I emphasized that, to avoid facing reality, the UNESCO ideology all too readily hid behind contradictory assertions.\\"  (p. xv).<br /><br />The Preface also calls attention to Chapter 2 on sociobiology, \\"expressing my opinion of this would-be science . . . criticizing its vagueness, its reckless extrapolations, its internal contradictions.\\"  (p. xv).<br /><br />However, \\"The fact is that there is no opposition between constraint and liberty, and that, on the contrary, they support each other\\" (p. xvi) except for fools whose life is \\"an act of faith in the omnipotence of spontaneity.  This illusion, although certainly not the cause, can nevertheless be seen as a significant aspect of the crisis that afflicts Western civilization today.\\"  (p. xvi).<br /><br />Among people mention in a footnote on page 178 is \\"Johann Jakob Bachofen (1815-87), Swiss jurist and historian, known for his work on the theory of matriarchy;\\" only a page after \\"it is conceivable that the persistence of an initial pathological situation may be expressed in schizophrenia as the oscillation between two extreme feelings: . . .  Thus, the schizophrenic will never achieve the normal experience of living in the world.\\"  (p. 177).

US	44184384	RE35W9UGXG0IG	067084134X	855770597	Ravelstein	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Life, comedy, intellect: conflicting priorities	This book was first published in 2000, some years after the events described, if you can believe the narrator that his dead friend (\\"He died six years ago, just as the High Holidays were beginning.\\") wanted this whole story told in a way that would capture events as they were lived.  Abe Ravelstein was a professor who was popular, possibly deep, incredibly intelligent, and HIV positive.  Saul Bellow was supposed to write his biography, but this book is a novel, though possibly close enough for government work.  Some people in the book have names that might be familiar to scholars or people who `had their shirts made on Jermyn Street by Turnbull & Asser (\\"Kisser & Asser,\\" as I revised it).'  The humor is partly concocted of Jewish individuals living in a world which has a few former Nazis and a former student named Philip Gorman who turned into \\"right now one of the Secretary's closest advisers.\\"  But this was written before the current president was in office, though the gossip has plenty of familiar names.  \\"Colin Powell and Baker have advised the President not to send the troops all the way to Baghdad.  Bush will announce it tomorrow.  They're afraid of a few casualties.  They send out a terrific army and give a demonstration of up-to-date high-tech warfare that flesh and blood can't stand up to.  But then they leave the dictatorship in place and steal away . . .\\"<br /><br />One of the themes is \\"Great Politics.\\"  Nietzsche would understand how brilliant people ought to be able to fit into productive situations, or educate a flock of brilliant people who could enjoy taking part in whatever action was going on.  \\"It's only a matter of time before Phil Gorman has cabinet rank, and a damn good thing for the country,\\" though a good education in \\"the fourth wave of modernity\\" might be as hard for most people to grasp as the bulk of Nietzsche's unpublished notes on nihilism.  Saul Bellow does not claim to know the finer points, but he mentions Plato, students reading the original Greek, Paris, Machiavelli, and he can imagine Phil Gorman contributing to the process by keeping in touch:<br /><br />\\"But he knew what pleasure it gave his old prof to hear the inside dope, so he briefed him out of respect and affection.  He also knew that Ravelstein had masses of historical and political information to update and maintain.  This went as far back as Plato and Thucydides--perhaps as far back as Moses.  All those great designs of statesmanship--going back through Machiavelli via Severus or Caracalla.  And it was essential to fit up-to-the-minute decisions in the Gulf War--made by obviously limited pols like Bush and Baker into a true-as-possible picture of the forces at work--into the political history of this civilization.  When Ravelstein said that young Gorman had a grasp of Great Politics, something like this was what he had in mind.\\"<br /><br />Abe is not above praising Abe Lincoln.  \\"As president of all the people he thought he was obliged to talk to all these parasites, creeps, and promoters.  All the while he was standing in a river of blood.  War measures made him a tyrant--he had to cancel the habeas corpus writ, you know.\\"  Saul Bellow was reckless enough to try to capture the aura of insanity that such a situation provides.<br /><br />\\"You're what people would call feckless, in the days when such words were still in use.  Of course we're good and fed up with personality profiles, or defects.  One reason why violence is so popular may be that psychiatric insights have worn us out and we get satisfaction from seeing them blown away with automatic weapons, or exploding in cars, or being garroted or stuffed by taxidermists.  We're sick of having to think about everybody's problems--Grand Guignol mock-destruction isn't good enough for the bastards.\\"<br /><br />It is impressive that this book was written before the American embassy in Baghdad became such a large command post.  Being stuck with such policies is the world-historical joke akin to Chick having a suit made for Ravelstein:<br /><br />\\"You wanted to do something for me.  It was generous, Chick, and Nikki was the first to say it.  But Gesualdo is way behind the times.  He makes mafiosi-type clothes, not for the dons but for the soldiers, the lower-rank gangsters.\\"<br /><br />Intellectual superiority is able to imagine levels which are so much higher that within a few pages Ravelstein will buy a Lanvin jacket for $4,500 and spill coffee on the lapel.  \\"He was still drinking the expresso; his head was far back.  I kept my mouth shut, turning away from the large brown blot on the Lanvin coat.  Another sort of man might have sensed at once that something had happened--\\"<br /><br />If this book had an index, it could have a number of entries for an account by Keynes of the French finance minister who thought he had a prior claim on German gold as opposed to American interests who wanted to allow the Germans to spend the gold for food to feed their starving population.  It is mentioned early.  \\"But you did that well, Chick, about Lloyd George's nasty youpin parody.\\"  Ravelstein's interest in \\"the Jewish side of the thing\\" was incidental to his interest in \\"politics, a subject for which Ravelstein had a very special understanding.\\"<br /><br />The book also takes a special interest in certain people and couples.  Though it is about intellectual personalities, \\"I'm going to leave intellectual matters to the experts.\\"  It is more like \\"when he spoke to me he spoke intimately but also for the record.

US	44184384	R2ZTEBWDSOCT0L	039304839X	224026761	The Return of Depression Economics	Books	5	7	10	N	N	A history of linked liquidity trap dynamics	I like Paul Krugman, having started enough of his books to recognize the ideas which are most familiar to him when he brings them up again.  THE RETURN OF DEPRESSION ECONOMICS was published in 1999, when the possibility of something awful like a stock market crash in the United States was still hypothetical, but not fundamentally considered the major concern that would determine the sluggish future of global economic activity as a repeat of the years 1929 to 1941 if a decline in the capitalization values of major enterprises did slow things down a bit.  When I started reading this book, I had to wonder if I read it before, but most of the ideas I encountered were easily tied to themes in Krugman's subsequent books and columns that are frequently brought to mind by the large number of daily reports on the financial picture.  THE RETURN OF DEPRESSION ECONOMICS attempts to capture the dynamics of speculation in a global economy leading up to July 1, 1997, understood as a situation similar to Latin America in 1995, Japan in the 1990s, but subject to such shocks as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's ability to use excess dollars to buy local stocks which hedge funds had sold short in order to force the hedge funds to lose money.<br /><br />\\"And the reaction was fierce indeed.  The government actions were `insane,' thundered Milton Friedman; the Heritage Foundation formally removed the city-state's designation as a bastion of economic freedom; newspapers linked Hong Kong with Malaysia, which had just imposed draconian capital controls.\\"  (p. 128).<br /><br />The key point of view of Krugman might be captured best by his description of the reaction to a speculative attack on Brazil in the fall of 1997, after losing foreign currency at an alarming rate in August.  Because interest rates were already high, the economy was sure to slow too much due to an IMF request to raise taxes and cut spending to reduce a deficit which \\"would actually have been fairly modest had the economy not been depressed and had interest payments not been so high--both of which were in large part consequences precisely of the markets' lack of confidence.\\"  (pp. 147-148).  Three alternatives for dealing with such a situation have some support from Krugman, who thought a form of stability might be achieved after the Brazilian real was devalued by 8 percent on January 13, 1998.<br /><br />\\"January 15:  The central bank stops intervening in the markets and lets the real float.  The market reaction is surprisingly favorable:  the currency drops only 10 percent, much less than pundits expected--and the Brazilian stock market surges an amazing 33 percent, apparently believing that the end of the currency peg will allow the government to cut interest rates and engineer an economic recovery.\\"  (p. 149).<br /><br />Then a bad weekend intervened.<br /><br />\\"January 16-17:  Brazilian officials fly to Washington and meet with IMF and Treasury officials, who insist that despite the good news on Friday interest rates must be raised, not lowered, to stabilize the currency.\\"  (p. 149).<br /><br />Instead of getting better, the results seemed familiar.<br /><br />\\"Indeed, Brazil's crisis had the feel of a recurrent nightmare:  once again, as in Mexico, Thailand, Indonesia, and Korea, a seemingly successful economy had gone to Washington in its hour of need, tried its best to follow the plan Washington devised, and been rewarded with a catastrophe.\\"  (pp. 150-151).<br /><br />It is not surprising that Krugman is considered political and extremely one-sided in his point of view, but the idea that an increase in interest rates is likely to bring about a decline in economic activity in whichever country has the greatest need to attract dollars to maintain the basic imbalances in trade and government finance at the root of its economic problems continues to be relevant.  Hedge funds borrowing Japanese currency at low interest rates in the years covered by this book are considered amajor factor in the big swings in the exchange rate when much of the activity in this book occurred.  Looking for irony now in how well China managed to restrict the flow of capital in those years, only to cause major upheaval in the petroleum market today as a result of the growing energy needs of the Chinese economy, might make investors weary of Krugman's concern for those who \\"have thus far managed to avoid being caught up in the maelstrom--usually because they have not played by the rules.  The prime example is, of course, China--corrupt, crony-ridden, with terrible banks, but saved so far by its inconvertible currency.\\"  (pp. 151-152).

People in the KH4K community, who established the web page of kerryhatersforkerry.com, should be able to understand the fundamental relationship between the German people and the truth, however strange and difficult to describe such utmost confidence in their own ability to prevail in spite of whatever opposition the rest of the world might theoretically amass once the conviction that any retreat is impossible has taken hold at the appropriate level.  A single page of this book offers enough parallels to the basic policy of being a superpower to provide examples of how some evil genius willing to make a pact with the devil is a better explanation of world events than anything reported in the daily papers:<br /><br />\\"By spring 1918 the German high command privately accepted the inevitability of defeat, yet kept it from a still trusting German public completely unprepared for the harsh consequences of an unconditional surrender.\\"<br /><br />\\"As the military had calculated, those who signed the instruments of peace became `criminals' in the eyes of many of their fellow countrymen, who accused them of stabbing Germany in the back.  The leader of the delegation, Center Party member and Acting Secretary of State Matthias Erzberger, became the hated messenger and was assassinated two years later, in 1921.\\"  (p. 243).<br /><br />A few things in American history might be equally as bad.  Those who have become totally paranoid about deeply secret politics involving Jack Ruby, in which Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated in Dallas in 1963 after providing information to the FBI on former CIA undercover operations being continued after President Kennedy tried to shut them down, might even think patsy-picker J. Edgar Hoover was primed to allow Oswald to take the blame for the assassination of President Kennedy because that would be far less frightening to the American people, not to mention foreign leaders, than a messy search for a plot that would be closer to the truth.  Kennedy had openly supported a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty before he was shot, and the U.S. Senate did not ratify a total ban the last time it came up for a vote, though Vice President Al Gore vowed to bring it up for another vote first thing, if he was elected president.<br /><br />My impression of this book is based more on the great question:  What is German? as conjured into a storm by Nietzsche than on the pallid reflection by Steve Ozment in this book, which includes Goethe's observation, \\"Two souls, alas! within my breast, and each withdraws from and repels his brother\\" (p. 195).  So sorry to be one of \\"58,000,000 Americans [who] can claim full or partial German descent\\" (p. 1), but my father became a minister in the United States in 1944 to lead mainly German Reformed congregations in the great Midwest to become successful in the kind of life that those who remained in Germany could only dream of, if they were fortunate enough to survive the history that German Volk brought upon themselves by attempting to oust those who resisted \\"assimilation--namely, the working poor, migrant workers, Jews, and journalists.\\"  (p. 194).  I am mixing up very different periods in history here, but that is the most common reaction whenever I attempt to read about my German heritage.<br /><br />Religion gets plenty of attention in A MIGHTY FORTRESS, but only with the detachment that modern thinkers apply to maintain feigned respect while dismissing the abilities of German writers like Schleiermacher, David Friedrich Strauss, and Friedrich Nietzsche.  Quotes contain the jargon, but few pages capture the self-righteousness of those who are saved individually by their own principles but continuously see the rest of the world going to hell.  The most modern aspect of American society is the great accusation that an individual is nothing compared to the desires of millions, and this book carefully weighs the down payment Germany paid for its greatness.  \\"On the eve of the Great War, Germany had been a great power second only to the United States, and by the war's end two million Germans had died on European battlefields.\\"  (p. 248).  The rest of the world actually ganged up against Germany twice in the twentieth century, with women in Germany given the vote in between, and \\"In an exuberant democratic gesture and coalition-building tactic, fringe parties were given seats proportional to their share of votes.\\"  (p. 244).  If people couldn't agree, a state of emergency could be declared to centralize authority.  \\"Known as Article 48, this powerful measure would later allow President Hindenburg's chancellors to rule briefly as strongmen, and the last of them--Adolf Hitler--to do so indefinitely.\\"  (pp. 244-245).  In America, democracy can still flourish because it openly maintains the power to detain hundreds or thousands of those who have no power within the existing system.  Books like A MIGHTY FORTRESS might even be encouraged because they show how often people with incredible intellectual abilities can end up in a worse situation than anything that has been experience by residents in America since the year when General Sherman marched through South Carolina.ost modern aspect of American society is the great accusation that an individual is nothing compared to the desires of millions, and this book carefully weighs the down payment Germany paid for its greatness.  \\"On the eve of the Great War, Germany had been a great power second only to the United States, and by the war's end two million Germans had died on European battlefields.\\"  (p. 248).

The best joke is when you have already seen the punchline  W A I T  A  M I N U T E ,  I ' M  I N  T H E  W R O N G  J O K E  in bold face in the margin on page 162, inset into the last paragraph on the topic Global Capital that suggests \\"countries need only follow our rules to join in the New New Extravaganza.\\"  The joke with that punchline doesn't even start until this book attempts to explain a basic truism:  Capital abhors a vacuum.<br /><br />Since Freud did a lengthy intellectual analysis of wit and its relation to the unconscious, humor has gained acceptance as a vehicle for understanding unusual situations.  The key thing about THE NEW NEW ECONOMY by Tim McEachern and Chris O'Brien is that it treats everything that is happening in modern society as anomalous from the point of view of the simple economic view that practically everyone ought to be able to go to work and do something with the understanding that people and companies usually get paid for whatever they do.  One of the authors of this book, Chris O'Brien, is an attorney specializing in bankruptcy and taxation law, and he must be familiar with situations in which businesses are so far behind in making payments that everyone they owe might get only a fair share of whatever net worth is left at the end of the proceedings.  One of the funny things about this book is how often it reminds the reader how much a law suit could spoil their whole day.  I like the way that aspect of reality escalated in the story on pages 81 to 97.  \\" . . . through a fluke of Pennsylvania law, . . . Sue us. . . .  So sue me. . . . Anyway, most of them are suing now. . . . In any event, the whole matter has been placed in suit. . . . Now they have to remove millions of fruit bats, which my people tell me can't be done.

US	44184384	R3SG5Q35O902	0252026136	256120273	Stupidity	Books	5	10	17	N	N	A very modern approach to a current topic	This book is much better than any explanation can convey.  The topic itself, STUPIDITY, defies any subtitle that could limit this consideration to any particular time and place, but the handling which it receives from Avital Ronell contains all the elements necessary to illustrate how thoroughly modern and \\"unparalleled disruption of meaning extends well into the twentysomething century.\\"  (p. 148).  I might have been paying close attention because this was near the end of a paragraph on writers who \\"fortifying philosophical reflection with pornographic poses, will never be forgiven for the way they introduced the unintelligible . . .\\"  (p. 148).  Published by the University of Illinois Press in 2002, STUPIDITY demonstrates that the intellectual foundation for a field of knowledge on this topic currently exists, and that most of its investigations are likely to exceed the level of fun that might be discovered in competing fields.  If politics is considered one of those fields, how apt is it that the only page listed in the index of this book for Ronald Reagan directs the reader to the thought:<br /><br />\\". . . that Ronald Reagan and subsequent replicants are now said to have had a personality, that you have to watch your weight, that they got away with it, . . .\\"  (pp. 72-73) ?<br /><br />The single page of Contents has short titles for an Introduction and four regular chapters, with a drawing and three italicized titles for deconstructive subsections:  Kierkegaard Satellite, Wordsworth Satellite:  \\"The Idiot Boy\\" and Kant Satellite:  The Figure of the Ridiculous Philosopher; or, Why I Am So Popular.  Notes on pages 313-351 often contain lengthy comments.  The Introduction on pages 3-29 has 56 notes.  Though a number of philosophers show up in this book, Nietzsche, one of my favorites, gets major credit right at the start.  `While stupidity is \\"what is there,\\" it cannot be simply located or evenly scored.  Not since Nietzsche pulled the switch and got the powerful forces of alternative valences going.'  (p. 3).  `Raising it, he more or less forgets stupidity, like an umbrella.'  (p. 4).  Nietzsche can be quoted on \\"successfully posing as more stupid than one is--which in everyday life is often as desirable as an umbrella--is called enthusiasm.\\"  (p. 4, from BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, section 288).<br /><br />The index has numerous entries for Nietzsche, but did not direct readers to note 27 on page 323 in which Avital Ronell mentions her previous effort:<br /><br />I have explored the logic and valuations of immunodeficiency in Nietzsche in \\"Queens of the Night,\\" FINITUDE'S SCORE:  ESSAYS FOR THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM (Lincoln:  University of Nebraska Press, 1994), 41-61.<br /><br />A few philosophical themes appear more often than I expected, as you might guess from the first entry in the index:<br /><br />Abraham, 211, 266; Derrida on, 351n; Kafka on, 13-14, 280, 287-294, 306-310; Kant on, 280, 284, 287, 297, 300, 302; Kierkegaard on, 280, 289, 349n; Lacan on, 351n; Spiegel on, 351n<br /><br />The three notes on page 351 are all about Abraham.  As one starts, \\"Take still another Abraham, one who stages a collusion . . .\\" to bring about Lacan's function of the superego.<br /><br />There are 23 lines in the index for Friedrich von Schlegel, and his LUCINDE is a major topic between pages 132 and 166.  There are eighteen lines in the index for Robert Musil, who is quoted at the beginning of chapter 2:<br /><br />Is this lady stupid?  (Ist diese Dame dumm?). . . But politeness as well as justice demand the concession that she is not absolutely and always stupid. -- Robert Musil, \\"On Stupidity\\"  (p. 62).<br /><br />First pictured in this book at an early stage:<br /><br />If stupidity were that simple--if stupidity were that stupid--it would not have traded depths for the pits and acted as such a terror for Roland Barthes or Robert Musil or preschoolers.  (The little ones receive their first interdictory instruction when told that they musn't call anyone \\"stupid\\"--the ur-curse, the renunciation of which primes socialization in this culture.)  (p. 10).<br /><br />Musil is listed in the index for seventeen topics, such as:<br /><br />on intellectuals vs. women, 22, 53, 72, 76, 78, 79-81;<br /><br />and Musil also appears on a page labeled  Infotag:  EXPOSITORY PROSE<br /><br />\\"That Kant writes like a pig is stated repeatedly by Jean Paul, by Heine, by Nietzsche, by Musil, and by other beautiful writers, mostly ironists, but first of all by Kant himself:  Kant's inability to write wounds and embarrasses the philosopher. . . .  He couldn't help it, and it wasn't his fault.  Philosophy cannot present itself directly; it is fragile, . . .\\"  (p. 282).<br /><br />The more you learn about this field, the more stupidity becomes a topic that is a lot of fun.  It might even reach further than you think:<br /><br />\\"At this point, rather suddenly, Dostoevsky makes an attempt to purify the air around idiocy, if only by clearing the way for stupidity and ordinariness.  As it turns out, that way has already been cleared and its name is Gogol, who can be credited with having brought to the fore the inescapable power and range of sheer stupidity.\\"  (p. 217).y musn't call anyone \\"stupid\\"--the ur-curse, the renunciation of which primes socialization in this culture.)

US	44184384	R1S5PXT7A4GNE1	0395637511	276074767	A Journey Through Economic Time	Books	4	6	8	N	N	As history, it makes sense.  Mainly frightful!	I like the early parts of this book best.  John Kenneth Galbraith has been an economist with first-hand experience in a lot of areas:  Canadian Scotch farmers, the big stock market crash, wage and price controls, post-war economic assessment of strategic bombing, post-war aid, Keynesian stimulation of economic demand, the political views of businessmen, but people who read this book are most likely to notice how fond he is of economic programs which benefit the less fortunate at the expense of those who are most comfortable with things as they are.  Though published in 1994, this book praises Social Security as a miraculously successful program passed in 1935, based initially on benefits \\"at distinctly modest, even primitive levels, old age pensions\\" (p. 93), though opponents might complain.  \\"An Ohio Chamber of Commerce official of strong historical bent found that similar measures had brought the fall of Rome.\\"  (p. 94).  Ohio???  The state and the United States are still evenly divided on which way to head politically when economic matters are paramount, but any benefit that does not increase to reflect increases in salary levels is likely to seem primitive in this century.<br /><br />I once studied antitrust laws for a few years, with excellent instruction from some of the top professors, but it is not surprising that this knowledge rarely brings me riches or even meaningful employment since conflicts of interest can be a bar to active involvement.  As a legal topic, it is like trying to apply philosophy to promote freedom.  As Galbraith puts it,<br /><br />\\"For liberals in this time the antitrust laws were a comprehensive economic therapy.  Given any evident misuse of market power, more broadly any defective economic performance, the answer was clear:  enforce the antitrust laws.  This, then and later, became, on frequent occasion, the ready recourse of the devoid liberal mind.\\"  (p. 48).<br /><br />\\"These were not repealed; they were simply not enforced.  This was, save by the lawyers involved, one of the less noticed developments of the Reagan years.\\"  (p. 49).<br /><br />Galbraith's memory of the Reagan years must have been fresh when he wrote of that triumph for the view that \\"The domestic threat was the federal government, and specifically its power of taxation as this might be used on behalf of those outside the favored community.\\"  (p. 211).  The surprising thing about A JOURNEY THROUGH ECONOMIC TIME by John Kenneth Galbraith is how often he can identify policies which have changed drastically in the last century.  (Surtax rates went up to 65 percent on incomes over $1,000,000 in 1918.  (p. 26)).  Some steps even thwarted the rich hoards of previously inflated currencies.<br /><br />\\"The obvious solution was to diminish the regular currency outstanding by requiring the exchange of the existing notes for a smaller but functionally effective number.  This, with characteristic pragmatism, the French did in the early months after the war.  It had the further practical effect of denying to erstwhile black-market operators and those who had enjoyed special privileges under the collaborationist Vichy government any continuing advantage from their previous political reward; it was not wise to confess guilt by bringing in a currency hoard for exchange.\\"  (p. 143).<br /><br />World War II was unusual in that the economics of warfare had been refined to produce as much wealth as possible for the middle class in America, as young economists who had been working in the New Deal were sure to appreciate.  Galbraith was sure that his efforts controlling wages and prices had resulted in the greatest possible expansion of production.<br /><br />\\"As the demands of war procurement converged on the economy, there were two possible designs for enhancing return, for increasing profits.  One was to raise prices; the other was to expand production.  The price controls and associated wage restraints made the increase of production the onlyavailable course.  Profit maximization, not a subordinate goal in wartime, was served horizontally by more production, not vertically by higher prices.  Though not greatly noticed at the time, the price and wage controls had a strongly functional role in expanding wartime production.\\"  (pp. 117-118).<br /><br />I can remember when people who did not have oil wells complained that the only way to get rich was to have an oil well, because a depletion allowance in the income tax system allowed oil well owners to keep more of the money they made.  The top tax rate was over 90 percent during World War II, after having been cut by President Hoover to avoid a depression:<br /><br />\\"A taxpayer with an income of $5,000, a very comfortable return in those days, had his or her tax cut by two-thirds.  It went from $16.88 to $5.63.  Someone with $10,000, roughly the equivalent of $100,000 today, saw his tax go from $120 down to $65.\\"  (p. 78).<br /><br />The federal budget was a few billion then.  The previous war had been a significant expense, and John Kenneth Galbraith waits until Chapter 4 of this book to join with John Maynard Keynes (THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE PEACE) in an attempt to show that political views which settled in the minds of the negotiators of the Peace Treaty at the end of the Great War of 1914-1918 were an economic catastrophe.  Money works best when people spend it for things they need, and most unpredictably when it is borrowed in dire distress and never repaid.  \\"President Calvin Coolidge was adamant in expressing the reputable economic mood of the time:  `They hired the money, didn't they?' \\"  (p. 32).<br /><br />\\"Besides destroying a political and economic structure that had long been in place, the war reshaped for all ensuing time the relationship between nations great and small, rich and impoverished. . . . The First World War was, indeed, rightly called the Great War; World War II was its last battle.\\"  (p. 10).available course.

His actual father, Shirakawa, had started the insei, a political arrangement in which the retired monarch wielded far greater power than the ruling one. . . .\\"  (p. 242).<br /><br />There are a few footnotes in the play `My Friend Hitler' which remind the reader that the translator is trying to capture the style of German political thought that has been staged in Japan.  The footnote on page 133 actually begins with \\"Here, apparently with tongue in cheek, Mishima commits an improbable cross-cultural anachronism.  What Hitler refers to . . .\\"  I find it more ironic when Hitler is perplexed that his secret police are acting like secret police:<br /><br />HITLER:  No, you had your own problems.  What can you say about the disgusting things the SA did during the last two years?  No wonder the Reichswehr was put off.  You made hideouts in basements and warehouses; you tortured, kidnapped, demanded ransoms--I've even heard the story that in some districts troopers took their rivals in love affairs into basements, tied them up on the wall, and cut them up.<br /><br />ROEHM:  That lasted only a while.  It's just that the young men wanted to mimic what secret police do.  I've kept them in check and there's been nothing like that since.  (pp. 128-129).<br /><br />How likely is it that Hitler ever complained to a government official that \\"your men swagger about so obnoxiously that serious-minded citizens are completely put off, and as soon as they spot one of your men in the distance, they quickly hide their daughters.\\" ?  (p. 129).<br /><br />There are only four characters in the play `My Friend Hitler,' but it helps to have some knowledge of Goering and the rest of the upper echelon of the political hierarchy, including Defense Minister General von Blomberg, one that I do not recall myself, who are rivals of the main characters, half of whom will be liquidated by the final scene at midnight, June 30, 1934.  Another thing I didn't know was about Hitler's \\"law I passed last February after you joined my cabinet, which would give storm troopers wounded during political campaigns the same pensions as soldiers wounded during the war\\"  (p. 129).  Things must have been pretty bad for the army to be begging to get into the fight to restore order, but that is what Hitler called \\"the Prussian National Army's tradition beginning to roar at last.\\"  (p. 130).<br /><br />Surely the main point of \\"My Friend Hitler\\" is that being an old friend of young Adolf and a mouse that eats cheese left in a boot is not a perfect defense against imperfect legal proceedings, if you catch my drift.<br /><br />This book contains a Preface by Hiroaki Sato, five plays by Yukio Mishima, short Backstage Essays on the first production of his play `The Rokumeikan,' including \\"The Psychology of a Walk-On Role on the Stage\\" (pp. 60-62) about playing a carpenter who keeps his back to the audience for three or four minutes, during which the play seems \\"like an invisible monster that moves blindly in a certain direction while sucking them into the maelstrom it has created,\\" (p. 61).  There is a transcript of a speech Mishima gave to Kabuki trainees on July 3, 1970 with many footnotes added by Hiroaki Sato on pages 219-239, the explanation of the play on pages 241-245, and finally, \\"A Wonder Tale:  The Moonbow, The Original Tale by Kyokutei Bakin\\" on pages 246-307.

It reflects the thought of the political science department at the University of Chicago, where the author received a Ph.D. in 1973.  Scholars who expect to find twenty pages mentioning Leo Strauss will not be disappointed when they look in the index.  The Bibliography lists primary works by Aquinas, Aristotle, Hegel, Kant, Nietzsche, Plato, Rousseau, and Vico (pp. 273-276) as well as books produced in our own time on pages 276-279.  The interesting summary of this book is the Index of Passages Cited from Kant's Works on pages 280-284, in which the final column on each page lists the page in this book which discusses passages that are also listed by German edition and English translation.  People who know that Kant wrote something on Perpetual Peace are able to determine that his German works includes this in Volume VIII from pages 350 to 380.  Page xiii of this book reveals that the English translation of Perpetual Peace used here is contained on pages 85-135 of a book called ON HISTORY translated by Lewis White Beck, Robert E. Anchor, and Emil L. Fackenheim in 1963.<br /><br />Years ago it was not quite as difficult as it is today to imagine anyone reading Kant.  Many of my reviews have shown that Kant was often mentioned by Nietzsche, and that I have grown used to the characterization of Kant which Nietzsche adhered to, having learned it from German books that sought to explain what Kant meant without getting caught in any of his antimonies.  Stereotypes applied to philosophers often gloss over the nitty gritty witty ideas that make treacherous reading palatable.  As Nietzsche gets blamed for modern versions of political will to power far more often than Kant has been blamed for thinking something that is impossible for readers to comprehend, so Kant is not likely to be the first thing TV viewers would think of when they are reminded of the attacks of September 11, 2001, to give an example that is far more modern than anything Kant considered.<br /><br />Writing in a time of vast social changes, and days after a tsunami in the Indian Ocean may have destroyed a million homes, it is amazing to discover that another book also attempted to cover the same ground on Kant and more:<br /><br />\\"Note.  After this study was completed and as it was going to press, I received Michel Despland's KANT ON HISTORY AND RELIGION (Montreal and London:  McGill-Queen's University Press, 1973).  Though primarily concerned with the philosophy of religion, Despland's book contains a useful general treatment of the problem of history in Kant's thought as well as the first English translation of Kant's essay \\"On the failure of all attempted philosophical theodicies.' . . .  I believe that Despland's emphasis on possible continuities between Kant's early and mature periods leads to a blurring of the rigor of Kant's mature thought at several important points.\\"  (p. 279).<br /><br />The problem of history is one that is easiest to understand for someone who truly expects times to become bad, and getting a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1973 with a dissertation based on Kant, with a Preface starting with \\"the contemporary crisis of liberal democracy\\" (p. ix) that might expose \\"merely a transitory lapse of confidence or rather the death-throes of an entire mode of political organization and way of life\\" ought to be considered intellectual enough to see that this is a tough nut to crack.  Galston's concern about a blurring of the rigor which Kant proclaims in his philosophical efforts and which Despland ignores in emphasizing \\"possible continuities between Kant's early and mature periods\\" shows a level of expertise in philosophical historical thought which displaces contemporary \\"modern politics as an internecine struggle among ideological outgrowths of the modern historical consciousness.\\"  (p. 4).  Galston siding with Kant against Despland on this point is merely confirmation of Nietzsche's opinion that the big train wreck in the philosophy of history and religion already happened, and its name is Kant.<br /><br />On Perpetual Peace, Kant does not say:  you want it, you got it.  Liberalism gets in trouble when it allows people to vote for peace, or for being kept out of war, but then allows volunteers to be forced to do what has to be done in a superpower way to make the superpower's peace prevail.  As foul and filthy as contemporary culture has become, it does not allow philosophy to descend to such depths to describe how far the attacks of September 11 could be stretched to justify the toppling of other societies where anyone working with Americans or translating languages which G.I.s do not understand is a target for forms of violence that September 11 brought to American soil.  Galston turns to ideas in Kant that sound more like the Bible:<br /><br />`. . . happiness may be justly received only if it is not directly sought, so in the case of politics it may be said, \\"Seek ye first the kingdom of pure practical reason and its righteousness, and your end (the blessing of perpetual peace) will necessarily follow\\".'  (p. 188).<br /><br />Except that Galston is ultimately modern and American enough to ask, \\"But if one nation seeks to be moral while all others seek to aggrandize themselves, will the moral nation not quickly come to grief?\\"  (p. 188).<br /><br />Our philosophy can claim Kant because \\"It is in the light of the success of modern science that Kantian morality ceases to be an arbitrary choice, or a merely plausible replacement, guided by Christian insight, for classical morality.  The line of descent from Kantian morality to historicism and existentialism is unbroken.  In fact, Kant himself has formulated the existential problem.\\"  (p. 193).

The paragraph in which Fellini is allowed to explain himself is on page 44:<br /><br />\\"The only female clown to achieve lasting fame is Miss Lulu.  Gelsomina and Cabiria in my movies belong to the genus Auguste the Fool.  They aren't women, they are sexless,\\" says Fellini.  \\"Charlot, an Auguste, is equally devoid of human gender, just a happy cat that cleans its fur and walks where it pleases.\\"  Laurel and Hardy, \\"two more of the same type, they even sleep together like innocent children, as if sex did not exist.  Exactly that was what made the world laugh.\\"<br /><br />Norman Manea uses this to explain a nation's fascination \\"about the first couple of the land, forever locked in the presentation of the same routine:  the first couple.\\"  (p. 44).  Perhaps the comedy here is for those who constantly saw \\"Miss Lulena, who walks like a duck,\\"  (p. 45).  I am not close enough to \\"The buffoon of a lamentable buffoon?\\" (p. 49) to find it funny, but whenever I am questioned about current events in a survey of political opinions, I would like to respond as in the final paragraph of the \\"On Clowns\\" essay:<br /><br />\\"A circus routine that hasn't been announced.\\"  That was the answer given by the young poet Paul Celan before he went into exile in the West, forty years ago.  (p. 61).<br /><br />This book has no index, so the many references to figures in Romanian literature are most likely to be encountered by the reader by accident.  Lucky me, I usually open the book to page 23, where section III of the first Essay in this book on Romania opens with the paragraph:<br /><br />On receiving the literary prize of the city of Bremen, Paul Celan emphasized that he came from a little-known landscape, \\"a country inhabited by people and books.\\"  Celan was referring to the Bukovina of his adolescence, but these words could apply to Romania as a whole.<br /><br />Norman Manea was born in Bukovina, Romania in 1936, and his concerns with life and literature in that nation reflect the fear that government efforts to control the nature of heroes in that context mainly stifle the expression of anything that would be great.  I am particularly concerned with reading the political elements into this book because superpowers have a long history of thinking that disorder in smaller nations might easily be overcome by overwhelming support for an element that supports the global system.  Norman Manea has a very human reaction to the objections to 80 percent of one of his novels raised in \\"The Censor's Report\\" reprinted on pages 73-83, which wanted to cut \\"(the chapter with the airplane and the description of the Chief of State--has no relevance to the problems explored in the book).\\"  (p. 82).<br /><br />As much as the United States would like to spread democracy in other parts of the world to promote the peace of happy producers and consumers, there are elements of power politics involved that echo this earlier situation:<br /><br />\\"In mankind's outraged memory, nazism is characterized not merely by its racist ideology or by its militancy, but especially by the catastrophic consequences of Hitler's hysterical propaganda--arrogant brutality, devastating warfare, extermination camps.  But this infamous human tragedy has to be seen in the context in which it arose.  In a period of acute economic, political, moral, and intellectual crisis, national socialism offered a simplistic, violent, and `radical' solution.  Nazism, a very dark ideology from the beginning, did not at first mean crematoria; it developed slowly, slyly, cruelly, to its sinister culmination.\\"  (pp. 102-103).<br /><br />Most people don't picture the average superpower adopting similar measures as a logical result of economic suicide based on cutting taxes in a society in which government expenses are due to rise through the roof while technological growth slows to a crawl in the most logical financial collapse ever to surprise a complacent modern media, but we have become such a comic society that it would never occur to anyone to take our prospects seriously.<br /><br />The final essay in the book, The History of an Interview, (pp. 125-178), has a similar theme.  \\"The public uproar over my interview in `Familia' aggravated my far from idyllic relation with the power.\\"  (p. 153).  \\"Was the irony (and often the sarcasm) that the system provoked just, as was asked in the famous interview, `an epiphany of the derisory'?\\"  (p. 159).e through the roof while technological growth slows to a crawl in the most logical financial collapse ever to surprise a complacent modern media, but we have become such a comic society that it would never occur to anyone to take our prospects seriously.<br /><br />The final essay in the book, The History of an Interview, (pp. 125-178), has a similar theme.  \\"The public uproar over my interview in `Familia' aggravated my far from idyllic relation with the power.\\"  (p. 153).  \\"Was the irony (and often the sarcasm) that the system provoked just, as was asked in the famous interview, `an epiphany of the derisory'?\\"  (p. 159).	2004-12-26

Berger appeared in 1979 and I do not have a more recent version.  Chapter 1, Modernity as the Universalization of Heresy, attempts to define the modern situation.  Fate used to determine lives.  Now so many people respond to questionnaires that every nervous Prometheus is not only sure to be outvoted, but any question could become the Copernican revolution about which the future is made to revolve for as long as no one dares to agree about anything else.  Copernicus is the individual each of us is due to be compared with.  \\"As an analogy, even if one could demonstrate that Copernicus was an absolute fool with regard to the social realities of his day, this demonstration would not strengthen the theory that the earth is flat and that the sun moves around it.\\"  (p. 144).<br /><br />People are subject to dynamic cycles, and students of humor are likely to think that the major difference between people is that they know different jokes.  This book was written in years in which war and religion were considered different kinds of experience, and war, in particular, was even subject to multiple interpretations from a religious point of view.  \\"Thus the alleged moral teachings of Christianity may be abstinence from extramarital sex or universal tolerance for all expressions of sexuality, total pacifism or self-sacrifice in just wars, racial . . . and so on almost ad infinitum.\\"  (p. 115).  Surely there are polls to establish how well the people who claim religious views of one kind or another also adhere to a variety of ethical positions.  The present is a time when participants in war might even be quizzed on how well the Crusades are going right down to the day, hour, and minute in which journalists who have been hit turn to the camera and proclaim, \\"I'm dying.\\"  It turns out this book approaches that experience.  \\"Life has never been the same for me since the death of my mother.\\"  (p. 40).<br /><br />Societies have similar experiences, and it is not uncommon for intellectuals to mix up one experience with something quite different.  For example, Germany was winning territory in Russia and France in World War I, while enduring some starvation, before the American troops attacked the German lines at a few places in France.  Asking for an armistice then was hardly like being conquered by the Allied armies in 1945, but this book reports:<br /><br />\\"This safe world collapsed once and for all in that war, which may well be described as the collective suicide of European civilization.  What is more, the fact of this collapse did not take long to sink in.  It was visible right away, starkly and frighteningly, as were its moral and intellectual consequences.  Not surprisingly, this was especially so in central Europe, dominated by that German culture that was now linked to a nation that had been catastrophically defeated.\\"  (p. 71).<br /><br />Many other defeats in the twentieth century were as mild:  the United States in Cuba in 1961, and soon thereafter in Laos, Nam, and Cambodia; The Soviet Union in Afghanistan; Argentina in the Falkland Islands.  Letting down defenses before September 11, 2001, was part of a strategy of pretending that everyone was equally vulnerable to anything catastrophic.  This book was just taking a bleak view of Europe after World War I, noting the decline of bourgeois triumphalism to provide a need for religious revival.  \\"In any case, there is no dispute that its central, indeed overpowering figure was the Swiss theologian Karl Barth.\\"  (p. 71).  In contrast to the \\"Manifesto of the Intellectuals\\" (p. 72) which German theologians signed in 1914 \\"endorsing the German war effort\\" (p. 72), Barth supported a \\"Theological Declaration of Barmen\\" in 1934, which repudiated political moves in that direction and \\"remained decisive in showing the capacity of Barthian theology to stand up to the pretensions of the modern age.\\"  (p. 72).<br /><br />This book is not afraid to mention Freud, humor, jokes, Nietzsche, sex, and many of them on the same page, as the index indicates:<br /><br />Humor (the comic), and reality, 39ff<br /><br />Jokes, and reality, 39<br /><br />Sex and sexuality, . . . orgasm and reality, 39<br /><br />Such experiences are used to identify who an individual is as much as any other, and religion for an individual can be as great a reason to carry on in an intellectual fashion, though modern communication methods may differ in determining which topic is likely to bring more fame in the popularity contest that a society based mainly on entertainment values is rapidly becoming.  While the number of people capable of engaging in intellectual activity on the level of this book might not be any less than when the book was written, for those who have aged, the opportunities to engage in rethinking the religiously elevating experiences of Schleiermacher are likely to be few and far between.  But for this book, \\"Everything that followed Schleiermacher was either a development or a refutation of this position, which amounted to a Copernican revolution in theological thinking. . . . The turning inward of religious reflection must be seen in the context of the social and ipso facto psychological weakening of outward authority.  Put differently, the quest for certainty on the basis of subjective insights is the result of the frustration of this quest by what is socially available as objective reality-definition.\\"  (p. 69).<br /><br />It has been a long time since the instance recounted in this book in which people who were \\"within a tradition to which they were personally committed turned upon it the full arsenal of critical scholarship and let the theological chips fly where they might.\\"  (p.  70).

Early in the book, society is given the opportunity to assert its own preferences against Karlheinz Stockhausen, an opera composer who has used a Lucifer character regularly in a series of seven operas.  A four-day concert festival was cancelled in Hamburg after comments Stockhausen made on the events of September 11, 2001, based on early reports.  He was inspired by the idea that \\"people practice like crazy for ten years, totally fanatically for a concert, and then die.\\"  (p. 6).  \\"You have people so concentrated on one performance, and then 5,000 people are dispatched into eternity, in a single moment.\\"  (p. 7).<br /><br />The second chapter compares the aims of William Wordsworth, The Unabomber, and Don DeLillo.  In the third chapter, the relationship between Norman Mailer and author killer Jack Henry Abbott is explained by passages from Fyodor Dostoevsky's CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, Martin Scorsese's movie, `The King of Comedy,' and Bret Easton Ellis's character Patrick Bateman in the novel AMERICAN PSYCHO.  I am not familiar with the details of the following chapters, but Chapter 7 is called \\"The Last Maniacal Folly of Heinrich Von Kleist (A Fiction).\\"  (pp. 148-165).  A Short Bibliography lists works with ideas that have contributed to each of the seven chapters.  Then Works Cited (pp. 173-175) includes a web page for Karlheinz Stockhausen.  The index (pp. 179-187) includes the designation \\"mentioned\\" under Wordsworth for three pages where his name merely appears.  Dostoevsky also has two pages listed for \\"mentioned.\\"  T. S. Eliot takes 5 lines in the index, with only one page designated \\"mentioned.\\"  This kind of index is valuable for readers who often wish to locate what they previously read and check the relevance of offhanded comments.<br /><br />My interest in the book was mainly due to its look at Theodore John Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who is definitely both a writer and a criminal in a way that relates to the theme of this book.  Offhandedly, Ted's manifesto is subject to comments that illustrate a mentality that is ultimately individual:<br /><br />`Under normal grammatical conditions, as opposed to the conditions of Unabomber grammar, it is not possible to say that \\"civilization\\" is \\"criminal.\\"'  (p. 78).<br /><br />Ted was willing to plead guilty to avoid a trial that would seek the death penalty because he did not want to claim insanity to avoid punishment.  The defense team of lawyers had taken steps to substantiate insanity, but the preliminary issue of how competent Ted was to act in his own defense kept the trial from proceeding smoothly to a determination of that issue.  Thus I vaguely disagree with the assertion in this book that \\"Like the Unabomber, Raskolnikov is tried on an insanity defense because the world cannot accept the actions of such terrorists as rational.\\"  (p. 49).  I used to have an editorial cartoon on my wall in which lawyers behind Ted's back were making loony bin gestures while Ted was trying to protect all his Constitutional rights and the judge was trying to decipher the confusion about who was representing Ted's best interests.  Ted was going to be tried on the contents of his diary, which was written in a code that was found in his cabin, and the pleasure he finally displayed in being able to admit that he was the author of the Unabomber manifesto ought to balance the displeasure of those sentenced to years in prison for illegal substances that messed up their minds in ways that illustrate the concept of transgressive desire as much as this book does.locate what they previously read and check the relevance of offhanded comments.<br /><br />My interest in the book was mainly due to its look at Theodore John Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who is definitely both a writer and a criminal in a way that relates to the theme of this book.

US	44184384	R3L5YT0RC9WZZS	0195035860	886887341	Freud for Historians	Books	4	4	8	N	N	For historians more than really radical thinkers	While FREUD FOR HISTORIANS by Peter Gay is primarily about historians and the interplay between professors in that field and psychoanalysis, my own interest in maintaining a polymorphously perverse view of my own history, including the intellectual interactions inspired by Nietzsche, Freud, and Walter Kaufmann, who had written a trilogy including books on Goethe, Nietzsche, and Freud at the time of his death in 1980 in a quest to apotheosize a few worthy thinkers, leads me to attempt to examine the six major arguments presented in FREUD FOR HISTORIANS (1985) as applying to my own fractured self.  Nietzsche wrote like an author who was not as concerned about saying anything soothing to those who read to relax, as he chose instead to illustrate the danger of saying too much.  Walter Kaufmann had been born in Germany in 1921 but aptly came to the United States and served in military intelligence during World War II, then translated many of Nietzsche's works and the poetic drama Faust (1961) by Goethe into English as a professor of philosophy in a country that was so un-German, it had hardly been paying attention.<br /><br />Chapter One of FREUD FOR HISTORIANS is called Secret Needs of the Heart, and the strangest secret need which Nietzsche confessed was for music.  Plato as anti-poet philosopher started a long line of professors who would consider popular songs a reflection of the most trivial ideas of their time, but few professors openly considered the possible emotional impact of rock 'n' roll in wartime.  I myself felt like the American alter ego of Walter Kaufmann on that subject, eager to guess what his twenty favorite songs might be if he ever heard them.  Freud might have liked more of those songs than Walter Kaufmann did, and the jokes which Freud discussed in `Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious' (S.E., VIII, 9n is quoted by Gay on p. 59) were no less ironic than lines in some great popular songs, once the ice on that subject had been shattered and plunged through.  Peter Gay writes about \\"the guilt feelings of parricide\\" (p. 12) and answers sought \\"in politics, in day-to-day events.\\"  (p. 13).  Professors who do not write about anything this weird are unlikely to confess that they have a lot to learn.<br /><br />Chapter 2, The Claims of Freud, considers terms Freud used to illustrate mental aberrations, \\"regression and repression, projection and denial, ambivalence and transference and the rest of his professional vocabulary, as precise descriptions of very real mental acts.\\"  (p. 43).  People who consider history the result of the interaction of grandiose fantasies, no matter what position intellectuals choose to expound or condemn, even if those who act in historical roles have a \\"growing suspicion that Freudians are not better than religious fanatics, a tribe of true believers\\" (pp. 43-44), will have little trouble agreeing with Nietzsche's explanation of How the True World Finally Became a Fable (THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, pp. 485-486).  Gay explains Karl Popper's objections to Freud's theories.  \\"Psychoanalysis, in short, violated the fundamental scientific principle of falsifiability.\\"  (p. 63).  But Gay finds a standard in \\"the measure of the patient's motives, thoughts, and actions.\\"  (p. 73).  Walter Kaufmann even seemed vulnerable because of the nature of the country that he came from, Germany, and where he ended up, in the United States.  I also have ancestors from Germany, but a stronger association was with religion, which took in a large number of the motives and thoughts that seemed important to Walter Kaufmann.  Falsifiability might have a different meaning if the true world consisted of attitudes that were capable of being evaluated as traps that might be set to catch young people to their own disadvantage.  This is taking history a step further than an ordinary professor would push it.<br /><br />Chapter 3, Human Nature in History, seeks to escape \\"quintessentially Viennese\\" (p. 79) considerations.  Intellectual freedom always needs a \\"platform for a new departure in an old discipline.  It was a necessary act of intellectual parricide,\\" (p. 83) which might be a harsh definition of my relationship with Walter Kaufmann, at least since he checked the line on the postcard he returned to me in June or July, 1980, that said, \\"Give it your best shot.\\"  Gay includes some lines by Mephistopheles from `Faust' with a prose translation on pages 86-87 complaining that in traveling `Von Harz bis Hellas immer Vettern!' he has found \\"nothing but cousins.\\"  Readers can see what all makes \\"a family of desire.  Historicists were inclined to make light of such fundamental resemblances.\\"  (p. 87).  Speak of the devil!<br /><br />Chapter 4, Reason, Reality, Psychoanalysis and the Historian, quickly redefines reality to include fantasies and delusions that are acted on.  In Freud's world, \\"Worse than being merely unattractive, this reality is a Walpurgisnacht, gloomy, obscene, and mendacious, where nothing is what it appears to be.\\"  (p. 124).  I should apologize for thinking about Walter Kaufmann every time I read something about German thought, because I always seem to be making it sound worse than he would want to admit, and I was trying to be more American than German to him.  What was worse than German was my polymorphously perverse refusal to consider growing up a solution.  Even for Peter Gay, an analyst \\"is aware that external reality, more and more of it, lies along the path of maturation.\\"  (p. 126).  Everything depends on progress.  \\"As its motor skills and mental capacities develop, the child steps, in Freud's terse formulation, from the pleasure principle to the reality principle.\\" (p. 130).  Except in a comic society, where entertainment values rule, as Gay does not say.<br /><br />Chapter 5, From Couch to Culture, might be about intimacy, affective impulses, and Freud concluding that unsatisfied wishes might create \\"the idea of a cultural superego.\\"  (p. 145).<br /><br />Chapter 6, The Program in Practice, considers \\"Freud's essay on Leonardo da Vinci.\\"  (p. 182).

US	44184384	RHXWQ2S2CRO09	0865471037	555055404	Decadent Societies	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Mostly history and things to worry about	More as a historian than a philosopher, Robert M. Adams in DECADENT SOCIETIES provides a summary of a few instances in which empires have collapsed, along with instances of countries (France and Russia) that have paid so little attention to the welfare of the people in a single country that revolutions have wiped out the aristocracy of the Bourbon regime in France or the dynasty of the Romanov family and supporters which were previously considered the ruling class in Russia.  A final chapter, The Present Instance, written in 1983, when the author was old enough to get Social Security benefits, shows a wide consideration of problems that could snowball in a mature technological society, but generally dismisses concerns of the Moral Majority of that time, as well as more philosophical considerations.<br /><br />Several pages have footnotes, but there are no notes, bibliography, or index at the end of the book, and foreign phrases and the opening quotation from Montaigne are not translated.  The Introduction shows an awareness of the usual forms of condemnation.  \\"Overindulgence in food, sex, spectator sports, or television can be cited as evidence of decadence; it is the terminal state of any vice the moralist feels like denouncing.\\"  (p. 1).  In the field of literary criticism, \\"Eric Auerbach has shown in his classic study Mimesis that the wide and ordered vision of the classic period gave way during the late Latin period to the narrower, more confused, but more intense vision of Ammianus Marcellinus and Gregory of Tours.  Gregory cannot even recount clearly the episodes of a blood feud between two little gangs of rural thugs.  He doesn't have a structured view of experience, such as might order and relate things to one another.  His details are vivid but he cannot arrange them lucidly as Homer and Tacitus, for example, could.\\"  (p. 7).<br /><br />For philosophy and history, Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee are considered complementary on pages 12-13 in a way that brings the Introduction to the conclusion, \\"If the earth collides with a wandering star or nukes itself into a bed of glowing ashes, none of our personal qualities will be of the slightest interest to anyone.\\"  (p. 14).  The author's ability to provide numerous examples of leaders who effectively terminated their societies' world influence in less trying times, such as \\"Between 440 and 450, Attila the Hun ravaged all Europe without effective interference by Roman armies\\" (p. 19), is balanced by an awareness that a large amount of misery was required for any other alternative.  \\"Nobody could better have exemplified the concept of imperial duty than Marcus Aurelius, who clearly would rather have done almost anything than spend his life in the Danubian marshes fighting savage tribesmen.  Yet that was what, for the last ten years of his life, he did almost uninterruptedly.\\"  (p. 27).  The fall of Rome seems early compared to the eastern half of the empire, identified in this book with the city of Constantinople.  (p. 18).  The \\"great aristocratic houses of Constantinople . . . maintained across the centuries vital and vigorous military traditions.  Severe, laborious, brave, and (above all) intelligent, these were the men who made the Byzantine armies the best fighting forces known to the Middle Ages--and kept them that way for nearly a thousand years.  (We pluck the passing irony that Byzantium, which survived a full millennium after the fall of the Western Empire, earned thereby among the unthinking a reputation for `decadence' that still passes current--as if any society that endures a thousand years and then goes down fighting against overwhelming odds weren't thereby demonstrating vitality far beyond the average.)\\"  (pp. 25-26).<br /><br />France faced severe budget difficulties, an aristocratic Parlement which refused to impose necessary taxes, and \\"In the declaration of May 3, 1788, it not only declared that taxes could be voted only by the States General, but added that the lettres de cachet were illegal and that the customs and privileges of the separate provinces were inviolable.\\"  (p. 70, footnote on Tocqueville).  Attempting to undo the New Deal in the United States might have similar results if, as Adams wrote, \\"It is an attitude to which two-tier economies, such as we seem to be developing in the United States, are evidently liable.  The French experience adds callousness at home to the Roman example of weakness abroad as suggestive evidence of eminent social decline, and so of potential decadence.\\"  (p. 72).<br /><br />Russia was uniquely backward in many ways pointed out on pages 72 to 83, but what struck me most was the odd description of the intelligentsia element of Russian society.  \\"A few isolated `thinkers' adrift in a sea of illiterates, deliberately deprived of social functions and practical experience, but given self-importance by the mere fact of education, they were noses of wax, easily twisted by anyone who thought it worth his while.\\"  (p. 80, footnote).<br /><br />The British Empire furnishes a history which we are apt to apply to our own situation.  \\"Sir John Seeley once said, with a seriousness that German scholarship is quite incapable of understanding, that the British Empire was acquired in a fit of absentmindedness.\\"  (p. 85).  The failure to settle religious strife by the separation of Pakistan from India when the British withdrew is now compared to \\"children whimpering over the misdeeds of their parents\\" (p. 109) much as current problems in Asia hardly seem to be America's problems initially but could get much worse than when this book was written in 1983.  Economics is also important.  \\"All the statistics seem to support both Britain's absolute inferiority to the west European average in per capita GNP and the relatively slow rate of her industrial growth.\\"  (p. 113).<br /><br />Perhaps this book sees furthest into the future with the observations in The Present Instance on \\"Gluttons who eat enormous meals are like decadent Romans, but they are also like rich Victorian businessmen, like merchant princes of the Renaissance, and for that matter like St. Thomas Aquinas.\\"  (p. 128).  We are heavy, now.ed that the lettres de cachet were illegal and that the customs and privileges of the separate provinces were inviolable.\\"  (p. 70, footnote on Tocqueville).

Economics is also important.  \\"All the statistics seem to support both Britain's absolute inferiority to the west European average in per capita GNP and the relatively slow rate of her industrial growth.\\"  (p. 113).<br /><br />Perhaps this book sees furthest into the future with the observations in The Present Instance on \\"Gluttons who eat enormous meals are like decadent Romans, but they are also like rich Victorian businessmen, like merchant princes of the Renaissance, and for that matter like St. Thomas Aquinas.\\"  (p. 128).  We are heavy, now.	2004-12-18
US	44184384	R295SV9JIMF71Z	0674011740	747409495	Surprise, Security, and the American Experience	Books	4	5	8	N	N	History supports American policy.  Will it work?	There has been a tendency in the attention that Americans have paid to global policies of the great powers to ignore how local individuals can have a tremendous effect on what happens all over the world.  In SURPRISE, SECURITY, AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE, Yale professor John Lewis Gaddis gives credit to John Quincy Adams for setting American grand strategy before we had the military power accomplish much.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt gets credit for minimizing the amount of fighting that Americans engaged in during World War II:<br /><br />\\"Stalin's dictatorship was at least as autocratic as that of Hitler, and its record of murdering its own citizens was even worse.  It clearly did not seek a world safe for democracy, capitalism, or much of anything else apart from its own immediate interests.  Yet Roosevelt's strategy required keeping the Soviet Union in the war, because for every American who was dying while fighting it, some 60 Russians were doing so.  How then to align American interests with the Red Army's capabilities?\\"  (p. 51).<br /><br />I am not able to dispute anything in this book, but what it intends to mean is so tied to thoughts about American superiority that it is hardly ironic that there is no entry in the index listing religion as a strategy for obtaining anything through hypocritical humility.  Also unlisted:  holy war, violent movie sensationalism, Southeast Asian war games (Vietnam), and rock 'n' roll.  The index does show some attempts to move beyond the interests that were in the forefront in previous wars:  shock and awe, Islamic world: recency of Islamic rage in, and weapons of mass destruction.  The attention paid to several centuries of American expansion and waning European hegemony allows skeptics who thought the Cold War was largely a fake cover for increasing military-industrial expenditures to reflect on how often an economic plan for the future is in harmony with such schemes.  What this book is missing is an awareness that the surprise of September 11, 2001 came just when the American future was going kaput.<br /><br />The great depression was not important enough for the meaning of this book to be listed in the index, but an astute reading of pages on the times of American isolationism following the great slaughter of World War I shows a hint that we know so much more now than we did in those days.<br /><br />\\"The first clear challenge to security elsewhere came only in 1931 with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, a region that hardly seemed vital to the defense of the United States.  And even if it had been, the onset of the great depression would have constrained whatever inclination there might have been to act:  the discovery that going to war could restore prosperity would have to wait for another decade.\\"  (p. 44).<br /><br />Those who have an incredible ability to consider whatever income the top one percent of the population are making part of an indication of a restoration of prosperity in our own time might think they see an upswing now, but the enemies of the kind of warfare Americans engage in far from home are not detecting their own improvement.  Some Vietnamese were also expecting an economic takeoff after that war, but the 3 million Asians who died in the area-wide conflict and ethnic Chinese slaughtered in Indonesia in 1965 must outnumber those whose opportunities for smuggling paid off.  Those who think that smuggling might be a joke in this context should check to see what is listed instead in the index under Afghanistan.<br /><br />`Economic globalization:  Bretton Woods system and' is listed in the index.  \\"The purpose of Bretton Woods was to perpetuate the economic hegemony with which the United States was certain to end the war.\\"  (p. 53).  Until Nixon was president, it made sense for the United States to support a system that would require cash payments in the event of trade unbalances so countries that produced goods did not get stuck with a large supply of worthless currencies from nations importing.  World War II was a historical event in which the number of countries paying the United States for materials was exceptional.  Current events are based on contrary expectations, and it is difficult to express how much of the world maintains thinking that runs directly contrary to the American ideals in this book, however ideal they may sound in speeches by the president.s currencies from nations importing.

US	44184384	R1BA0LT5O9EWJS	1565848705	392312214	Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot.Com Juggernaut	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Well written, funny, and has very modern economic setting	This great story was almost over before I showed up.  James Marcus started working for Amazon.com in 1996, a year in which it did $15.7 million worth of business.  Options were granted then, but \\"You couldn't exercise and sell a single share until you vested, a process that began precisely a year after the options were granted.  In my case, that meant September 9, 1997:  prior to that date, I might as well have owned a strongbox full of Monopoly money.\\"  (p. 69).  The value of the options grew to fantastic figures.  \\"Whatever you did, the market kept behaving like a Roman candle, so it made no sense to park your cash in some chicken-feed bank account:  that was the equivalent of losing money, throwing it out the window.\\"  (p. 77).  \\"Until, that is, March 10 of 2000.  On that date the NASDAQ hit its all-time high, closing out the day at 5,048.62, and then commenced a long, ruinous slide, which would eventually siphon $3.8 trillion from our collective pockets.\\"  (p. 80).  Dropping back to May 15, 1997, the day of the initial public offering of Amazon.com stock, there was a crowd of employees waiting for an announcement from Jeff Bezos on the amount of capital raised, which heard the preliminary question:<br /><br />\\"Who had written the most book reviews in a single week?  (The winning total was 137, although I don't recall who the culprit was.)\\"  (p. 70).<br /><br />I could write that many reviews in a year, but it would be difficult to convey what each of those books had been worth to me if I tried to do it in a single week.  Someone younger than myself might be able to see the need for so many reviews as an opportunity to show how fast their fingers could type, but a business based on the activities of such frenetic consideration of the work of ten, or even a hundred, different authors needs the skills of a literary man like James Marcus to describe it adequately.<br /><br />Reviewers who seriously wonder who cares if their opinions have any legs should try doing an internet search for whatever name they put on their reviews to see if any Amazon.com partner sites are reproducing their views as authentic information.  James Marcus doubted that this would be going on after he took a card at the Book Expo America in Chicago in June 1997 from a woman who worked at R.R. Bowker who wanted to use their reviews, \\"treating us as responsible critics rather than hyperventilating shills.\\"  (p. 91).  Back then Jeff \\"was demanding enormous sums for our humble content\\" but it might have had so much potential that he was waiting for some offer that was sure to make him a billionaire.  The key was to find a way that fed in more business.  \\"The middleman, the genius of capitalism, was being engineered out of the picture.  If you had a taste for jawbreakers, you called it disintermediation.  If not, you just grinned and counted your money.\\"  (p. 91).  There is no index for checking how completely this book covers financial topics, but near the end, an opposite picture of Amazon.com is presented.  \\"Even our cachet on the Web itself had begun to evaporate; tech purists didn't like it when we enforced our patents for one-click shopping or the affiliates program.  We were stifling innovation, they claimed, behaving like the bullies who dominated the traditional corporate landscape.\\"  (pp. 221-222).<br /><br />Best of all was that customer reviews finally started to matter.  \\"A certain percentage of them were dumb as a post, of course, . . .  Amazon now had 15 million registered customers, and many of them liked to share their opinions.  Some of them couldn't stop sharing their opinions, as if their existence depended on it: they were nothing if not critical.\\"  (p. 224).  Managing customer reviews was a new system to produce some winners.  \\"Visitors were encouraged to vote on the reviews they read.  The scores were then tallied, run through some mysterious algorithmic wringer, and used to rank every single customer reviewer.\\"  (p. 225).  The way it works, \\"Quantity equals quality.  It's the statistical fallacy all over again, applied like a mustard plaster to my own line of work.\\"  (p. 226).  The author's own Jim Kibble reviews ranked above mine and won a $50 gift certificate, which I never did.<br /><br />If economics does not provide much humor for your life, you might consider buying this book for its description of the Nisqually Earthquake of 2001, 6.8 on the Richter scale, which certainly caught me by surprise.  Among the damage, \\"And across the street in F.A.O. Schwartz, a million or so pieces of candy had vacated their bins: gummy worms, lollipops, twizzlers, gumballs, caramels, and those little necklaces made of Sweet Tarts.\\"  (p. 240).  But work turned into a scheme \\"to carpet bomb the entire planet with email.\\"  (p. 247).  To redeem himself, James Marcus hand-complied a Classics list including something by the Marquis De Sade, sent out mailings, and in six weeks got nearly 25,000 hits and sold 3,956 books.  (p. 251).  I'm glad I found this book, but the burn-out that comes with being too long in a rapidly changing situation makes being a kindred spirit wearing at times.  Lit lovers will find a lot more here to like than I did.orks, \\"Quantity equals quality.

US	44184384	R11185LWWN1RD9	0465004075	142378968	The Dawn Of Universal History	Books	4	9	31	N	N	Trying hard to find theories and systems: so French	Raymond Aron, a witness to the twentieth century, only lived from 1905 to 1983, and was most famous for being a French professor, if not the greatest French professor, as noted in the Introduction by Tony Judt, (See the first note at the end of the Introduction on page xxv).  Judt himself has written books on the French left and French intellectuals.  I wondered how often Aron might have left France, and Judt reveals that his sense of timing was pretty good.  \\"A Jew and a socialist, he left France following the establishment of the puppet regime at Vichy and joined Charles de Gaulle's Free French organization in London.\\"  (p. vii).  Like a government that temporarily did not have a country, he must have made a lot of plans for things to do when he was home again.  \\"Upon returning to France Aron served briefly in Andr&eacute; Malraux's post-war Ministry of Information before returning to the university world to teach sociology, at the same time taking up what proved to be a lifelong parallel career as a journalist and political commentator.\\"  (p. vii).<br /><br />The essays in this book were originally collected in 1996 in France for publication of a history, and were translated into English for this 2002 Basic Books edition.  The first footnote on page 31 has an additional note revealing \\"All footnotes in this book are Raymond Aron's own notes to his texts,\\" translated from the French 1996 edition.  The book has an index, in which there are many entries for Vietcong, Vietminh (League for the Independence of Vietnam), Vietnam war, Johnson and, etc., which lead to a strange footnote on page 362:<br /><br />\\"Johnson did not tell the senators that U.S. torpedo boats had been attacked by North Vietnamese gunboats while the South Vietnamese were carrying out commando operations in the same region.\\"<br /><br />This confusing mix of covert activities is not offered as clarification for the famous resolution of August, 1964, but as an explanation of the American attempt to devise a strategy for Vietnam:<br /><br />\\"Like the French colonels in Algeria, many of the president's advisers believed that the techniques of subversion and persuasion could be effective in any circumstances.  The commando operations ordered by President Kennedy in May 1961, by way of a riposte to infiltration, then resumed on a larger scale* by Johnson, had nothing in common with the organization of parallel hierarchies.  Then there was the conviction, sincere in many cases, that the United States would jeopardize its role all over the world if it accepted defeat in any part of it:  This theory was proved by events to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Last, we must take into account the perhaps inevitable corruption of the men who conduct high politics. . . .  To be able to order such bombings in cold blood, and then enjoy a good night's sleep, calls for a kind of transformation.  Such a transmogrification may be necessary, but it takes place so easily that it always amazes me when I encounter it in men I used to know before they went into public life.\\"<br /><br />This is from an essay, \\"The Imperial Republic,\\" that attempted to understand \\"The United States and the International System,\\" which was originally published in French in 1984, well after the reunification of Vietnam, the death of former President Johnson, the humiliation of Nixon's efforts to keep anything secret because it was a matter of national security, as he imagined the (expletive deleted) Vietnam war was in a recorded conversation with John Dean that had long been public.  But Raymond Aron was dead by then, too, and this publication was actually prepared then by Jean-Claude Casanova, Pierre Hassner, Stanley Hoffmann, Pierre Manent, and Dominique Schnapper.  (p. 503, Provenance of Texts).  Publication of someone's work after death might allow others to emphasize something which borders on the incredible.  In such instances, the crazy bit seems to be the assumption that anyone was getting \\"a good night's sleep,\\" while artillery was being pounded out for H & I, ambushes at bridges, trails, roads, and rivers had to have some guard up at all hours keeping watch over the kill zone, and people expected to find a newspaper at their front door when they got up to start their day in other parts of the world.  Even professors must be up at all hours to find time to put words on paper and keep track of whatever secrets they have been able to discover.<br /><br />The confusion surrounding the footnote on page 362 has been so great at all times since August 1964, that it looks like a great mistake when a truth slips out in this book:  U.S. torpedo boats had been attacked by North Vietnamese gunboats.  The gunboats had been directed at a covert operation that was directed on a large scale by Johnson, and the North Vietnamese had expected to run into U.S. destroyers because Johnson had ordered two destroyers to cruise in the Gulf of Tonkin when the undercover operation was also approved, but small swift boats that had attacked a radar installation were able to slip away while the American destroyers were shooting at targets (phantom blips on a screen) that were miles from nowhere.  The South Vietnamese were not involved in this operation, in spite of what McNamara told senators off the record.  French historians are much more likely to base their accounts on information received from the North Vietnamese, who would be the only Vietnamese who had any knowledge of what happened that night in August 1964, and \\"U.S. torpedo boats had been attacked by North Vietnamese gunboats\\" was precisely what the North Vietnamese were saying.<br /><br />Reading the PENTAGON PAPERS, Aron was unable to figure out Kennedy's policy.  \\"But he refused to send in units of GIs.\\"  (p. 361).  15,000 advisers from the Pentagon seems to be about what Bush expected to leave in Iraq before 2003, and he is still trying to make that work.ight's sleep,\\" while artillery was being pounded out for H & I, ambushes at bridges, trails, roads, and rivers had to have some guard up at all hours keeping watch over the kill zone, and people expected to find a newspaper at their front door when they got up to start their day in other parts of the world.

This is just the beginning of a cartoon history set, ending on page 358 with suggestions for further reading on ancient Greece.  I was worried about being able to find a title page for each of the seven volumes, since there is no table of contents at the beginning and no index, but each volume is exactly 50 pages, and the pages are numbered.  The main question I had about actually reading this book was how funny could history be, after all these years, going back to creatures and situations that are as remote as anything modern authors might imagine.  The first totally fantastic laugh is on page 2, where the author admits the book \\"is the outcome of my nine years at HARVARD, where I studied mathematics--\\" and time travel, though professors who are \\"mathematicians can't tell a second hand from a second base!!  We parted ways in 1972...\\"  Volume 1, starting on page 3, covers The Evolution of Everything.  The first footnote appears on page 7, another on page 9, and the footnote on page 10 reveals \\"Since it's in the nature of radioactive elements to decay into stable ones, the Earth must have been far more radioactive 4 billion years ago than it is today.\\"  That is not as funny as the first joke by a rock about life:  \\"You close yer eyes for a hundred million years, and the next thing you know, yer covered with green slime!!\\"<br /><br />The molecular biology is comic when you actually get the picture of \\"The first crude cells.\\"  (p. 12).  By the next page, the planet has eating and \\"an ozone layer in the upper atmosphere which screened out cosmic rays...\\"  Still on a microscopic level, sex starts getting promoted early and often, and it's \\"also a way to sell comic books!\\"  (p. 17).  The need for natural death is pointed out in a footnote on page 19, trilobites become the predominant form of life on page 21, but died out in the first of three great extinctions on page 29, \\"While on land many primitive amphibians croaked.  Urk!  A lethal pun!\\"  Then the continental drift splits the original landmass on page 35, and puns are back on page 39 with \\"Duck!  A dinosaur!!\\"  Primates get more interesting.  \\"You are such a swinger, you big ape!\\"  (p. 47).<br /><br />Volume 2, Sticks and Stones, has a big picture of Africa at the beginning.  Volume 3, River Realms, starts at \\"Seven thousand years ago,\\"  (p. 103).  Volume 4, Part of the Old Testament, shows Jericho, the first walled city.  Volume 5, Brains and Bronze, shows Aegean civilization starting on Crete.  Greeks \\"first harnessed the horse.\\"  (p. 208).  Oedipus (=\\"swollen foot\\") is shown on pages 212-214 might be unfunny.  Like Jocasta says, \\"Get serious!\\"  Dionysos is explained on pages 242-245.  Volume 6, Who Are These Athenians? reports on the history of Herodotos.  \\"And the best thing about Herodotos: he makes up all the dialogue!!  A historian after my own heart!\\"  (p. 252).  Volume 7, All About Athens, starts with the Persian invasion of Greece in 480 B.C.

US	44184384	R2X8LQASB382P8	0231126107	829512746	Five Modern Japanese Novelists	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Highlights of the books and best personal moments	This small book about FIVE MODERN JAPANESE NOVELISTS by Donald Keene, who had opportunities to make more observations about them than anyone could possibly remember in the years during which he became aware of their work, met them, read their books, wrote about or tried to put their words into English (Supplemental readings at the end include the titles of his major history of Japanese literature, DAWN TO THE WEST, and his translations of AFTER THE BANQUET, FIVE MODERN NO PLAYS, and MADAME DE SADE by Mishima Yukio, and translations of FRIENDS, THE MAN WHO TURNED INTO A STICK, and THREE PLAYS by Abe Kobo).  Keene is so familiar with the word order used for Japanese names that it shows up in the oddest places.  Maybe this is for humor, which always seems to be welcome at Columbia University:<br /><br />\\"I first met Abe Kobo in the autumn of 1964.  He had come to New York . . .  With them came a young Japanese woman.  I confess that I was rather miffed when I was informed that the young woman was their interpreter, and in order to demonstrate that I had no need of an interpreter, I studiously avoided even looking at her.  It was only years later that I learned that she was Ono Yoko.\\"  (p. 65).<br /><br />These people are all so smart, it even seems funny that they have so much trouble fitting in, as when Abe graduated from medical school \\"in 1948 but was given his degree only on condition that he never practice medicine;\\" (p. 74).  Early in the book, Keene has a few details about being \\"at the U.S. Navy's Japanese-language school\\" (pp. 2-3) and getting some early practice \\"while in Hawaii during the war, I had read his novel NAOMI\\" (p. 1).  Then in 1951 an English translator gave Keene the three Japanese volumes of THE MAKIOKA SISTERS by Tanazaki Jun'ichiro (1886-1965).<br /><br />This book has an index, and you can look up Nobel Prize for Literature and find out that Kawabata Yasunari (1899-1972) won it in 1968, but it might be politically selective, because \\"he had served since 1948 as president of the Japanese PEN Club,\\" (p. 23).  A news report that Tanazaki Jun'ichiro had won the Prize in 1964 \\"was a mistake, and by the time Japan's turn at last came up in this geographically controlled competition, Tanizaki was dead.\\"  (p. 24).  Keene would also like you to know, \\"What prevented Mishima from obtaining the prize?\\"  (p. 25).  How many Swedes could think Mishima was a young leftist (some secret committee would expect that to be a bad choice) instead of a right-wing nationalist who would end it all with seppuku on November 25, 1970?  Keene was more aware of the political situation in Japan because \\"In June 1970, on the night the security treaty with the United States came up for renewal, I was in a taxi with Mishima\\"  (p. 46).  And the opening sentence of the last letter Mishima sent to Keene was \\"When you read these words I shall be dead.\\"  (p. 48).<br /><br />The final Japanese author to get a chapter in this book, Shiba Ryotaro (1923-1996) worked as a reporter.  Keene had not yet met him in 1971 and should have been suspicious when an editor told him that he would like to publish a dialogue, and that when Shiba was \\"told that I was unfamiliar with his writings, had insisted that I was not to read them.  This gracious concession made it impossible for me not to take part in the dialogue.\\"  (p. 86).  Shiba turned it into a book in which he said they had been \\"comrades in arms\\" (p. 87) because they had both served in the same war.  Shiba wrote travel books and historical fiction.  Though not popular in the rest of the world, \\"His writings inspired a whole country, not with patriotic zeal, but with a quiet awareness of what being Japanese has meant through history.\\"  (p. 99).<br /><br />It is a bit surprising that the early parts of this book make World War II seem like a much bigger catastrophe for the Japanese than the index, which only has entries for \\"war, 40, 72, 87.\\"  (p. 113).  Kawabata Yasunari served as an air-raid warden, enduring \\"the cold of the night and feel my own sadness melt into the sadness of Japan.  I felt there was a beauty that would perish if I died.  My life did not belong to me alone.\\"  (p. 41).  Mishima Yukio had a cold the day he reported for his physical examination, but \\"when the inexperienced young doctor asked if he always had a fever and coughed so much, he nodded gravely.  His cold was diagnosed as pleurisy, and he was sent home the same day, to his joy and relief.\\"  (p. 51).

US	44184384	RNN15GQGUWWS5	0231114141	753202369	Intimate Revolt	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Intellectual exile therapy: reading	I have read several books by Julia Kristeva, but I have difficulty recalling the points that each signifies, so it was a relief to me, when I started this book, that it stated an outlook on modern society which I share wholeheartedly.  For people who are growing older, reading seems to be an activity that offers fewer rewards than ever, and it becomes difficult to find any indication that authors have been gaining anything by being aware of philosophy, to pick a topic that has reached modernity with as little certainty as the physics of subatomic particles.  The multiplicity of approaches and observations diminishes the opportunity for any point to be important in a system which only understands certain kinds of schemes:<br /><br />\\" . . . European culture--a culture fashioned by doubt and critique--is losing its moral and aesthetic impact.  This moral and aesthetic dimension finds itself marginalized and exists only as a decorative alibi tolerated by the society of the spectacle, when it is not simply submerged, made impossible by entertainment culture, performance culture, and show culture.\\"  (p. 4).<br /><br />My review of Kristeva's book on Hannah Arendt attempted to demonstrate, by counting the footnotes in that book, how much it was merely providing a reading of the volumes of THE LIFE OF THE MIND on THINKING and WILLING.  The notes for INTIMATE REVOLT show much wider interests, but this book is Volume 2 of THE POWERS AND LIMITS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS and continues reading as in the previous volume.  \\"I will explore new texts among the works of the three major authors examined in volume 1, Aragon, Sartre, and Barthes, each an integral part of the revolt of the twentieth century, and emphasize the paradoxical logic by which this experience of revolt is accomplished.\\"  (p. 3).<br /><br />For those who are not concerned so much with reading, there is a chance to skip ahead to Part II, The Future of Revolt, which has its own Preface, Chapter 13, Psychoanalysis and Freedom; Chapter 14, The Love of Another Language; and Chapter 15, Europhilia-Europhobia.  I had always pictured Julia Kristeva as an exclusively French feminist psychoanalyst, but Chapter 14 reveals that she is an exile whose native tongue was Bulgarian.  If she could only adopt \\"the tradition of offhandedness--when not nationalism--toward any remedy for our century,\\" she might actually seem French.  \\"I have so shifted into this other language, which I have spoken for fifty years, that I am almost ready to believe the Americans who see me as a French intellectual and writer.\\"  (p. 246).<br /><br />So INTIMATE REVOLT turns into a book which is ultimately about issues of self, and Julia Kristeva becomes an example of someone who is trying to fit in as an intellectual because none of the other ultra modern cultures appeals to her sense of self.  Revolt is a theme which ties philosophy to literature in a quest for new values that seeks to go further.  \\"The nihilist is not a man in revolt in the sense that I investigated in volume I.  The pseudorebellious nihilist is in fact a man reconciled with the stability of new values.  And this stability, which is illusory, is revealed to be deadly, totalitarian.  I can never sufficiently emphasize the fact that totalitarianism is the result of a certain fixation of revolt in what is precisely its betrayal, namely, the suspension of retrospective return, which amounts to a suspension of thought.  Hannah Arendt has brilliantly developed this elsewhere.\\"  (p. 6).<br /><br />In addition to the authors previously mentioned, this book frequently delves into Christianity, Freud, and Heidegger.  The intellectual method owes a lot to the subject matter:  \\"In making a narrative out of free association in transference, the subject at once confronts what is . . .\\" in a way that \\"constitutes himself in himself for the other and in this sense reveals himself--in the strongest sense of the word, liberates himself.\\"  (p. 236).  Analytical discourseapproaches \\"the endless refraction that constitutes psychical splitting.\\"  (p. 236).<br /><br />Kristeva has also written a novel, POSSESSIONS, a detective story, which she considers a low form of revolt that keeps the possibility of questioning alive.  Combining \\"a police investigation is still possible\\" (p. 4) with her concern that \\"the arrival of women at the forefront of the social and ethical scene has had the result of revalorizing the sensory experience, the antidote to technical hair-splitting\\" (p. 5) she attempts to question the past in a way that produces freedom for us, as \\"In his reading of Kant, Heidegger reconnected with another version of freedom, anchored in pre-Socratic thought before the establishment of logical categories or values.\\"  (p. 236).approaches \\"the endless refraction that constitutes psychical splitting.\\"  (p. 236).<br /><br />Kristeva has also written a novel, POSSESSIONS, a detective story, which she considers a low form of revolt that keeps the possibility of questioning alive.

The pages are long horizontally, usually presenting text and a large number running from 1 on the page after page 5 to 365 on the page two pages before page 736.  The index lists the big numbers only, the \\"Take\\" number.  Are punching bags in the index?  No.  Is Jean-Michel Basquiat in the index?  Yes, for six Takes under \\"Basquiat, Jean-Michel\\" and for three of the same Takes under \\"Jean-Michel Basquiat\\" (portraits, only one of which includes \\"and urine on canvas\\").  Is The Last Supper in the index?  Yes, for three Takes.  Do any of the Takes listed for Jean-Michel Basquiat coincide with Takes listed for The Last Supper?  No, neither three or six, none!  Which Take has ten punching bags?  Take 255!!!  How many times is Take 255 in the index?  Just once, for \\"Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper).\\"  Obviously, to use the index you need to know precisely what you are looking for.<br /><br />In my previous review of a DVD on Andy Warhol as a great artist of the 20th century, I believe I understated how many times the word \\"JUDGE\\" appears on the ten punching bags.  In the view shown in the photo in Take 255, I can count 5 times on the first, 6 times on the second, then 3, 5, 4, 4, 1, 1, 3, and 4 times, respectively, on the third to the tenth bag.  Most of the bags look black and white, but the eighth bag has a blue crown or dark halo which might obscure a second \\"JUDGE\\" or \\"JESUS,\\" a blue shape like a torso with head, the words \\"LEAD\\" and \\"ASBESTOS\\" and possibly BS, with a copyright insignia after the \\"JUDGE\\" at the bottom of the eighth punching bag.  The bags are hanging so close together that a physics student is bound to wonder how many bags would start swinging if viewers had the opportunity to give a bag on one end a good punch into the rest of the line.  The head of Christ appears to be largest on the first, fifth, and sixth punching bags, with the second and eighth having the smallest heads, to produce a standing wave effect even when the 14 inch diameter by 42 inch long bags are hanging stationary from chains to big beams in the ceiling.  The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh used to be a big warehouse, and Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper) might still be hanging there, because Entry 255 is not listed in the Photograph Credits, unless the bags are included in the bragging rights claimed by \\"Except where otherwise noted, ownership of all material is The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh.\\"  (p. 742).

Those who find the source of their ideals in humanism might expect to find Edward W. Said providing strong support for the political application of such ideals, as the final selection in this book, \\"The Public Role of Writers and Intellectuals\\" (pp. 119-144) was previously published in `The Nation' (2001).  Lectures that were begun in January 2000 at Columbia University were expanded in October and November 2003 with delivery at Cambridge University, then revised for publication to address \\"a world of heightened animosities\\" (p. xvi) due to the unfortunate events of September 11, 2001.<br /><br />I found Nietzsche more often in the text than in the (two) listings in the index, but the two listings in the index for \\"Vietnam War, 12-13, 34\\" merely suggest how much motivation can be wrung from \\"This Cold War cultural tension\\" in spite of the desire of those who wish to teach refinement above all else as \\"an unpolitical, unworldly, and oblivious (sometimes even manipulative) attitude to the present, all the while adamantly extolling the virtues of the past\\" in the choice of subjects for study.  The situation breaks the hearts of those who get all fired up to do one thing, only to discover \\"that there are no jobs for them or that they have to teach many hours of remedial courses in several institutions as adjuncts or part-timers without health benefits, tenure, or prospects for advancement.\\"  (p. 14).  This is so sad, it brings to mind how many people of the next generation found some mild recognition of their own intellectually tortured times by turning to comedy.  In truth, when the loyalty of Americans is questioned, entertainers who can show some comic supernatural powers in a way that is far over the top of whatever level the late Edward W. Said (may he rest in peace) is on in his consideration of changes that occurred in the years he taught, prior to his death on September 24, 2003, are far more likely to be appreciated by the generation currently starting out in life, if the comic nature of everything that American society attempts is fully understood, than this overly serious summary of professional thinking. Columbia University even found its way into remarks that Ted Rall used to introduce himself to the Yale Political Union in New Haven, Connecticut, on December 4, 2003, just a year ago:<br /><br />\\"Thank you for inviting me here tonight.  As someone who has been both expelled by and graduated with honors from Columbia University, a place you rarely think about, I know that you'll accept the sympathies that I'd like to offer on behalf of a beloved Yalie George W. Bush. . . .  Sadly, this middle-aged white man . . . finds himself, in the immortal closing voiceover from Kubrick's `Full Metal Jacket,' in . . .\\"  (GENERALISSIMO EL BUSHO, p. 181).<br /><br />The profane flavor of the knowledge that Ted Rall flaunts in his opening remarks is primarily a warning to those who might follow the political footsteps of their own times if comedy fails to deter such an outcome by showing that no one is being fooled unless such foolishness is freely chosen by those who fall for an immortal closing line.  Said attempts to provide the same warning on an intellectual level by pointing out that \\"Immanuel Wallerstein has, over the last couple of years, been writing a sustained intellectual critique of Eurocentrism that serves my purposes here very well,\\" (Said, p. 52).  The lecture on philology begins with a comparison of the hermeneutics of language in Arab-Islamic culture with interpretation in Europe since Vico's NEW SCIENCE (1744) that brought about the insights of Nietzsche, Emerson, and Richard Poirier.  After a number of attempts to describe close reading, we find the advice, \\"Only connect, says E. M. Forster, a marvelous injunction to the chain of statements and meanings that proliferate out of close reading.\\"  (p. 66).  Thegoal of entering a text allows the reader \\"a component of personal commitment and extraordinary effort, called `ijtihad' in Arabic.\\"  (p. 68).  \\"It is not surprising that since the fourteenth century there has been a robust struggle going on about whether ijtihad is permissible, to what degree, and within what limits.\\"  (p. 69).  The danger of going too far \\"is what Swift parodies mercilessly in A TALE OF A TUB.\\"  (p. 69).<br /><br />The intellectual tradition of exiles has much in common with a topic of a book of essays by Isaac Deutscher on \\"how great Jewish thinkers--Spinoza, chief among them, as well as Freud, Heine, and Deutscher himself--were in, and at the same time renounced, their tradition, preserving the original tie by submitting it to the corrosive questioning that took them well beyond it,\\" (pp. 76-77).  A humanist asserting anti-superpower values in America is prone to its own form of toughness, \\"maintaining rather than resolving the tension between the aesthetic and the national,\\" (p. 78).<br /><br />Chapter 4, Introduction to Erich Auerbach's MIMESIS, provides an example of an exile who wrote a major book in the German language while in Istanbul during World War II, but who then came to America to be a professor at Yale until his death in 1957.  Auerbach also relied on Vico, who provided \\"a cycle that goes from primitive to advanced and degenerate epochs, then back to primitive, Vico says,\\" (p. 91).  There are some sweet instincts, and some not so sweet, and America today, as a place for thinking, confounds anyone who is seriously going to contend that this is being figured out.  All that follows from the simple observation that America was attacked threatens to prevent any thought that would like to jump back to before that happened to try to arrange things a bit differently.

With the current controversies about secret provisions inserted in late-night conference committee drafts of important end-of-session appropriations legislation, it is not surprising that most people are capable of believing that the United States has reached a level of secrecy which makes the scenes shown in Ted Rall's cartoon possible, if not probable.  Most of us don't actually know where Jimmy Hoffa's body ended up, and it is a shame that this book does not have an index to allow curious readers to look up Hoffa and see if Rall has a new theory on that, but we are sure to have a few ideas about events between October 10, 2000 (\\"Never has that been clearer than during this sad, pathetic, duller than death election year.\\"  p. 17) and the Last Word on March 2, 2004 (p. 207) and the essays in GENERALISSIMO EL BUSH allow news junkies to see how much more or less than Rall we knew then or know now.  When it comes to predictions, Rall made some good ones, and I am unaware of any that were so far off he had to leave them out of this book in 2004, when, like the Worst-Case Scenarios cartoon on page 21, \\"The Jerk stops here\\" sign looks like it is on the desk in the Oval Office.<br /><br />I find the humor great, but I should be emphasizing how much the book shows an interest in technology and economics, two subjects which are not often prevalent in comic looks at the world situation.  On February 17, 2002, Rall and I both took an interest in the Afghan Tall Man Khan, who was 5-feet-eleven but was attacked by a Hellfire missile fired from a Predator drone because he was mistaken for Osama bin Laden, who is 6-feet-4.  (p. 68).  Rall reprints information from the New York Times article by John F. Burns without further comment, except about \\"thousands of indiscriminately dropped bombs\\" in Afghanistan where Rall went to report on the war in November 2001.  But the idea shows up in a `Beyond the West Wing' cartoon on page 112:  `All I have to do is declare you an \\"enemy combatant\\" and WHAM!! Hellfire missile!\\"  That article is about a November 3, 2002 \\"Central Intelligence Agency rub-out of alleged al-Qaeda operatives riding in a car in Yemen.  Langley fired a Hellfire missile from a remote-controlled Predator drone into the vehicle, blowing up several men.  The CIA later discovered that an American citizen, Kamel Derwish, had inadvertently been killed in the resulting inferno.\\"  (pp. 111-112).  Costs are revealed in the \\"You Can Sponsor the War Against Iraq\\" cartoon on page 118:  \\"PREDATOR DRONE Sponsor for $40,000,000 (Just ONE big Lotto win!) Fires HELLFIRE MISSILE Sponsor for $58,000 (Same as your WORTHLESS KID'S COLLEGE TUITION).\\"  Rall's first column in this book after Bush 43 actually became president complained that Congress doubled his pay in 1999 by a vote of 276-147 in the House.  \\"Clinton earned $200,000 each year; Bush will get $400,000 doing the same job.\\"  (p. 35).  The accounting scandal panic is discussed on pages 89-93, with a look at the big change in corporate compensation in our lifetimes:<br /><br />\\"Accounting fraud is closely tied to CEO greed.  Corporate executives skim obscene salaries off the revenues, getting paid tens of millions of dollars while driving venerable companies out of business and hard-working employees out of work.  Companies argue that these payouts are necessary to find and retain the very best managers, but history disproves that canard.  Plenty of talented executives work for significantly less, and plenty of overpaid greedheads do a lousy job.  CEO pay ought to be capped, as the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a decade ago, at twenty times the income of the lowest paid employee.  Such a measure would insure that all boats are lifted by a rising tide and protect shareholders from rapacious executives.\\"  (pp. 92-93).  Rall has a proposal to make employees totally uncapitalistic:  \\"To truly prevent insider double-dealing, CEOs must be banned from owning shares of their own or related corporations.\\"  (p. 93).<br /><br />Ted Rall is unlikely to make millions on his books, which will never be as popular as the `Peanuts' comics, but he seems to have a wage-slave labor value of wages view that is directly contrary to the roller-coaster and gambling mentality that makes capitalism a game in which wages are just one plaything among many for maximizing the total take of those who can see how it is occasionally possible to grab all the money before anyone else will realize what is going on.  As far as people are concerned, the essay \\"A Government of Gangsters\\" captures the current administration's policy most clearly on January 29, 2002:  \\"During the last several months, at least six thousand people have vanished off the streets of the United States.  Kidnapped by government agents, they have no idea when--or if--they will be released from prison. . . .  Since the disappeared haven't been granted access to lawyers or allowed to call their families, no one can talk to them.  Bush says they have no rights because they're not American citizens-but we don't even know if that's true.\\"  (p. 63).  Rall is expecting more surprises, rather than less, because the \\"sovereignty-busting gangsterism\\" (p. 94) ties in well with the doctrine of \\"permanent revolution\\" developed by Leon Trotsky in 1915 and used already for mass distraction by Hitler, Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung.y less, and plenty of overpaid greedheads do a lousy job.

US	44184384	R3K7CKGOZ85FB1	0743233158	626933031	The Yeats Reader: A Portable Compendium of Poetry, Drama, and Prose	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Great in small doses	This book does not have an index, but the Contents on pages vii-xiv provide the titles of poems, plays, autobiographical writings, critical writings, and five examples of the prose fiction of William Butler Yeats arranged by volume title (listing about 30 books published from 1889 to 1939, plus eight plays dated 1902-1939).  People who just start reading at the beginning of the book have little reason to be aware that there are notes from page 485 to page 566.  People who discover the Notes will need to know the order in which items appear in the book to refer back and forth between one and the other.  Many dates, magazines, and names of people and places are mentioned in the Notes.  There is information about the Irish Republic to explain the poem, \\"Easter, 1916\\" which ends on line 80 with \\"A terrible beauty is born.\\"  In the Notes, the poem \\"The Second Coming\\" has a rather complex interpretation, including, \\"All our scientific, democratic, fact-accumulating, heterogeneous civilization belongs to the outward gyre . . .\\"  (p. 503).<br /><br />Yeats had an interest in the occult which makes his stories seem a bit quaint for my usual fare, but his fame as a great poet is based on much material that is highly intellectual.  If this book had an index, I would certainly look up William Blake to see if his name could be found in this book as often as Major Robert Gregory or any other.  The selection of critical writings by Yeats contains a few pages on \\"William Blake and the Imagination.\\"  Unlike usual experiences, \\"But when one reads Blake, it is as though the spray of an inexhaustible fountain of beauty was blown into our faces, . . . but when one reads those `Prophetic Books' in which he spoke confusedly and obscurely because he spoke of things for whose speaking he could find no models in the world about him.  He was a symbolist who had to invent his symbols;\\"  (p. 373).<br /><br />Margins have numbers every ten lines for keeping track of where the Notes fit into a poem, and it is a rare poem (`The Tower' has 195 lines, within which Yeats brags on page 87, \\"And I myself created Hanrahan\\") that has more than fifty lines.  A poem on page 101 ends with line 130, and on page 108 ends with line 100.  The last page of the poems section has part III of the poem, `The Circus Animals' Desertion,' which ends with a line that I think is famous because I know at least two people who could recall:<br /><br />I must lie down where all the ladders start<br /><br />In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.<br /><br />Any poem that I associate with Yeats seems to be in this book, but I have not been trying very hard to learn more than bits and pieces at any one time.  The story `Red Hanrahan' on pages 460-468 has some card shuffling mixed with magic, bewitching a poor hedge schoolmaster.  It is a bit creepy, but the Stories of Red Hanrahan published in 1905 offer a link between the great poet and the culture of the pub that make it easier to understand what popularity was about in the times before television.  Further information about culture in those days could be deduced from the section in his autobiographical writings about Oscar Wilde:<br /><br />\\"My first meeting with Oscar Wilde was an astonishment.  I never before heard a man talking with perfect sentences, as if he had written them all overnight with labour and yet all spontaneous.\\"  (p. 295).  \\" `Furthermore,' was Wilde's answer, `I never answered their letters.  I have known men come to London full of bright prospects and seen them complete wrecks in a few months through a habit of answering letters.' \\"  (p. 296).em, and it is a rare poem (`The Tower' has 195 lines, within which Yeats brags on page 87, \\"And I myself created Hanrahan\\") that has more than fifty lines.

The story `Red Hanrahan' on pages 460-468 has some card shuffling mixed with magic, bewitching a poor hedge schoolmaster.  It is a bit creepy, but the Stories of Red Hanrahan published in 1905 offer a link between the great poet and the culture of the pub that make it easier to understand what popularity was about in the times before television.  Further information about culture in those days could be deduced from the section in his autobiographical writings about Oscar Wilde:<br /><br />\\"My first meeting with Oscar Wilde was an astonishment.  I never before heard a man talking with perfect sentences, as if he had written them all overnight with labour and yet all spontaneous.\\"  (p. 295).  \\" `Furthermore,' was Wilde's answer, `I never answered their letters.  I have known men come to London full of bright prospects and seen them complete wrecks in a few months through a habit of answering letters.' \\"  (p. 296).	2004-11-21

Unlike feeling bad about a recent election, my sympathy with Richard Nixon is due to my desire to echo a complaint from his final press conference after losing an election in California in 1962, when he blamed the press for not having a single reporter who wrote whatever the candidate said.  The complaint that I would like to make in this review goes much deeper.  Reviling Nixon as I do, it is ultimately ironic that I find his sympathy for democracy in Russia much more appealing than the glory of gloating on being the lone surviving superpower, an approach to global politics that American political thinking was engaging in back in 1992 and still has not yet shaken off, which is particularly glaring in the never-ending struggle to impose regional changes in 2004 in places like Baghdad.  If anything, the efforts of the current Bush administration to spread democracy in the times and places of its choosing seem so unlikely and altogether much worse than whatever Nixon was suggesting in 1992 that it is almost unthinkable that any policy expert at this late date could even guess:  what was Nixon thinking?  Comedians had provided audiences with some of their greatest laughs by contemplating that question, and this book is perfectly clear on that in the final paragraph of chapter nine:<br /><br />National Public Radio, usually sober in its presentation of the news, was struck by the fact that Bush and Clinton had both delivered their speeches on April 1--April Fool's Day.  The afternoon program \\"Talk of the Nation\\" invited Rich Little to do one of his famous Richard Nixon impersonations on the air.  \\"Having marched up this hard road and won back your confidence,\\" Little/Nixon pronounced, \\"I ask you once again to make me your President.\\"  The phones \\"went berserk,\\" said an NPR spokesperson, obliging the network to confess that it was all a joke.  (pp. 138-139).<br /><br />Nixon then went to Russia and met with Yeltsin on June 4, 1992, and \\"on February 10, 1993, soon after Clinton took office, a totally different kind of discussion took place.\\"  (p. 141).  Like talking about small change today, Nixon thought he might be able to help with \\"rescheduling Russia's huge $84 billion foreign debt for fifteen years.\\"  (p. 142).  As Nixon said, \\"One of the things that is absolutely essential is that we not consider Russia to be a defeated enemy.\\"  (p. 144).  I never hear anyone saying that about Osama bin Laden, but he probably isn't talking to former American presidents right now.<br /><br />Nixon met with Clinton, who was \\"looking for a way to help Russia without having to come up with new money. . . .  For reasons ranging from strict regulations imposed by the International Monetary Fund to bureaucratic chaos in Russia, less than half of the money had actually been delivered, much of it in grain credits, which helped feed the Russian people but also increased Russia's foreign debt.\\"  (p. 158).<br /><br />This book is almost about intellectual respectability.  Names dropped in June, 1994, can still sound impressive:  Graham Allison, dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard; Thomas Friedman, diplomatic correspondent of The New York Times and author of a front page article on March 10, 1992, with the headline, \\"Nixon Scoffs at Level of Support for Russian Democracy by Bush.\\"  I wish there was an easy way to describe the manner in which the point of view adopted by Marvin Kalb, formerly moderator of \\"Meet the Press,\\" in THE NIXON MEMO harps on Nixon's personal flaws to undercut the point on American foreign policy being promoted by Nixon in March, 1992.  Nixon feared that Russia could reemerge as a major problem for the United States, but in a larger sense, the failure ofthe American political system to come up with any decent solutions for places like Russia, then or now, leaves those who read the papers following stories which are all boiled down to individual self-promotion.  Expecting anything from Nixon that might continue to make sense is still unlikely in a perfect world, and on Comedy Central could be considered as crazy as any other journalistic assignment.  A rare moment of reverence, much noted and largely adhered to by news media thereafter, was reflected in the way that American reaction to September 11, 2001, became a factor in promoting the belief that Americans needed to rally behind the efforts of our president at that dismal time to join in his war on terror.<br /><br />The index on pages 229-248 has many distinguished names and topics.  An appendix on pages 217-223 has Nixon's memo, How to Lose the Cold War.  It starts with Russia, mentions \\"President Yeltsin's economic reforms\\" on page 218, as well as, \\"If Yeltsin fails, the prospects for the next fifty years will turn grim.\\"  Nixon praises Yeltsin for `throwing away the keys of what Lenin called the \\"jailhouse of nations\\".'  (p. 219).  \\"He has moved decisively toward privatization of Soviet enterprises and decollectivization of Soviet agriculture, steps Gorbachev refused even to consider.\\"  (pp. 219-220).  \\"If Yeltsin is replaced by a new aggressive Russian nationalist, we can kiss the peace dividend good-bye.\\"  (p. 222).  \\"Most important, a democratic Russia would be a non-expansionist Russia, freeing our children and grandchildren in the next century of the fear of armed conflict because democracies do not start wars.\\"  (p. 222).  Sure, this sounds like the same old, same old Nixon to some people, and Wilsonian democratic Crusades are as popular as ever now.  This book dotes on how such policies are seen by the press.the American political system to come up with any decent solutions for places like Russia, then or now, leaves those who read the papers following stories which are all boiled down to individual self-promotion.

US	44184384	RHMM3G6V4GN45	1570717753	566075828	E.E. Cummings: A Biography	Books	5	9	30	N	N	Mostly words, but spacing and punctuation are unusual	I read poems by E. E. Cummings before I went to Harvard, and might consider him my favorite American poet if Richard Brautigan had not written so many great little novels that seen far more comic to me than any mere poem.  Cummings has the breadth, though, to require some small print for the index of poems by first line on pages 602-606 of this book, which must be a couple hundred poems at 53 lines per page.  The items in the usual index on pages 591-601 have 54 lines per page, but with many more capital letters and the two columns of text covering an extra quarter inch of the page, items in the index do not seem so tiny.  31 of the 32 photographs are printed by permission of the Houghton Library, Harvard University, and the photo on the cover, taken by Manuel Komroff, was by permission of Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library.  The pictures in black and white include a major abstract oil painting by Cummings in 1925 and numerous sketches.<br /><br />The index does not attempt to capture every mention of each name in the book.  The entries for Ernest Hemingway do not include page 389, on which two poems in NO THANKS are called \\"really nothing more than a swipe at Hemingway\\" playfully \\"provoked in part by Cumming's reading of Hemingway's celebration of bullfighting, DEATH IN THE AFTERNOON:<br /><br />what does little Ernest croon<br /><br />in his death at afternoon?<br /><br />(kow dow r 2 bul retoinis<br /><br />wus de woids uf lil Oinis \\".<br /><br />Author Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno also calls this \\"a parody of Longfellow's line in A Psalm of Life, `Dust thout art, to dust returnest.' \\"  Modern versions of Genesis 3:19 have \\"you are dust, and to dust you shall return\\" for the familiar curse on Adam, but the King James version might have used a poetical thou, not thout.  No doubt there are a few mistakes somewhere.  I tried to find the verse with that line on the internet, and what Longfellow wrote was:<br /><br />Life is real! Life is earnest!<br /><br />And the grave is not its goal;<br /><br />\\"Dust thou art, to dust returnest,\\"<br /><br />Was not spoken of the soul.<br /><br />There are 12 lines for Harvard entities in the index, between Harry Wadsworth Clubs and Anthony Haswell, of HASWELL'S MASSACHUSETTS SPY OR AMERICAN ORACLE OF LIBERTY fame.  The Preface reveals that the author shares the anti-war feeling found in many of Cummings's most famous poems, and reports that \\"At one of the early [fall of 1969] California Moratoriums against the war I whipped up a crowd with `my old sweet etcetera,' `plato told / him,' and `the bigness of cannon / is skillful.'  When I got to `i sing of Olaf glad and big' a number of young men at the gathering set their draft cards on fire.\\"  (p. xiv).  People who have some copies of poems already will want to have them nearby while reading this book to remind themselves of all that the original said, especially about his aunt and Olaf.  Cummings was forty-seven when World War Two took the United States by surprise and Cummings wrote in his notes, among his definitions of War, \\"when the angry Jehovah gets back His Own.\\"  (p. 441).  This book offers translations into English of the phonetic poems written in \\"a parody of bigoted (probably drunken) speech\\" on pages 442-443 before putting the entire `plato told' poem on pages 443-444.<br /><br />E. E. Cummings developed some unique spacing and punctuation techniques that are constantly quoted throughout the book.  It is inspiring to read about so many people who admired what he did and supported his work, but he could also be highly critical of such friends.  The English philosopher A. J. Ayer is only listed in the index under Morehouse, Marion, affair with A. J. (Freddie) Ayer, 414, 423-424.  Back in June, 1937, things like that were starting to happen a lot in Europe, and modern readers shouldn't be as surprised as someone like E. E. Cummings's father, who had been an Instructor in Political Economy offering Harvard's first course in sociology, (p. 3), but then became an assistant minister at South Congregational Church when Cummings was about six, but lost his position in a church merger in 1925, and then became a director of the World Peace Foundation.  (p. 284).  People who are suspicious of pointy headed intellectuals who try to believe more than they read in the newspapers might not like this book, and people who watch TV all the time will find nothing in this book that is familiar, not to mention fair and balanced, but anyone who believes that an intellectual life can be the bedrock supporting future generations might find this book educational as well as enjoyable.ourse in sociology, (p. 3), but then became an assistant minister at South Congregational Church when Cummings was about six, but lost his position in a church merger in 1925, and then became a director of the World Peace Foundation.

Crumb has a very modern set of aversions.  Instead of doing a pamphlet for Planned Parenthood, he says, \\"But it's political.  I don't know how I feel about all that.  It's all so complicated.\\"  (p. 68).  The topics discussed in this book cover the psychic interior, and the corporate entities have subtle names, as in, \\"Nevertheless, Last Gasp has gone on to become the second largest underground publisher in the country.\\"  [back in 1974, when eight hundred dollars covered printing costs for an underground title] (p. 93).  R. CRUMB CONVERSATIONS (2004) has an index (which only has boldface listings for 6 pages showing cartoon characters, and it should've had boldface for Lenore Goldberg on p. 193 and Crumb as character on p. 198) on pages 233-244, and the Chronology on pages xiii-xxii includes such great years as 1993:<br /><br />\\"Crumb illustrates INTRODUCING KAFKA.  Summer:  The last issue of WEIRDO (No. 28) is edited by Aline.  June:  THE COMPLETE DIRTY LAUNDRY COMICS is published.  R. CRUMB SKETCHBOOK, May 1987 to April 1991 is published.  Fall:  A Crumb wall calendar for 1994 is published.  November:  R. Crumb Retrospective is shown at Alexander Gallery, New York City.  Kitchen Sink issues a Mr. Natural squeeze doll.\\"<br /><br />Four pages in the index are devoted to Crumb's views and works.  For example, on page 235 you can find:<br /><br />on Fritz the Cat, 120, 212-13; on Fritz the Cat (movie), 12-13, 28, 57-61, 174;<br /><br />But anyone who is in the part of the index devoted to Crumb's works will notice that Works on page 236 begins with THE ADVENTURES OF FRITZ THE CAT (Cavalier), xvi; and includes eight lines of listings of other Fritz the Cat characters in the second column on page 237, up to \\"Fritz the Cat Superstar,\\" 174, 213.<br /><br />Crumb has problems he feels because of his being a celebrity as a result of the documentary movie that was made about his life.  `When people asked me if I liked it, I said, \\"It's a good movie.  It completely ruined my life, but it's a good movie!\\"  (Laughs).'  (p. 218).  I usually feel that Crumb is being most honest when he says things that correspond to my feelings, but my situation has more concerns about sexual harassment in the workplace.  Comics is work that takes a tremendous amount of time and energy.  I used to subscribe to \\"Funny Times Magazine\\" (if you get a subscription and die laughing, it might be my fault, but it's not likely) and see what the more politically observant cartoonists were producing, but I was usually too tired to read each issue.  R. CRUMB CONVERSATIONS is more like reading a book.  With 18 major selections, mostly interviews, originally published in 1968, 1972, 1974, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1998, 1999, and 2003 (with an illustration from 1971 on page 11, from 1970 on p. 19, from 1967 \\"I wish somebody would tell me what `Diddy-Wah-Diddy' means...\\" on p. 22, from 1968 on p. 25, from 1959 on p. 30, from 1961 on p. 31, from 1972 on p. 32, from 1965 on p. 43, from 1963 on p. 45, a greeting card \\"I got a German shepherd\\" from 1967 on p. 46, \\"Keep on Truckin'...\\" from 1967 (the hit song \\"Truckin\\" by the Grateful Dead was years later, but the idea came from an old blues song) on p. 70, from 1967 on p.86, Whiteman on p. 89, from 1970 on p. 110, from 1985 on p. 124 and p. 139, from 1987 on p. 145, from 1971 on p. 153, from 1967 on p. 173, from 1970 on p. 192, from 1969 on p. 193, from 1982 on p. 198, from 1981 \\"Excerpts from Boswell's London Journal, 1762-1763,\\" on p. 207, and from 2002 on p. 228), the book does not explain that \\"Diddie Wah Diddie\\" was an old song until the final interview conducted by mail in April, 2002.<br /><br />`I don't spend nearly as much time dwelling on items that I \\"must have\\" for my collection as I used to.  That said, I recently found an old collector willing to sell me an old bunch of fabulous and rare old 1920s blues records, stuff I've been trying to find for decades, such asBlind Blake's \\"Diddie Wah Diddie\\" and Memphis Minnie's \\"Cherry Ball Blues.\\"  They're not cheap, but not top dollar either.'  (p. 226).<br /><br />It is easy to find Academy Awards twice in the index, but only because of the Chronology for 1991  \\"April:  Crumb's account of his attendance at the previous year's Oscar ceremony is published in `Premiere' magazine.\\"  And for 1994  \\"September:  CRUMB, Terry Zwigoff's documentary about his longtime friend, premieres at the Toronto Film Festival and goes on to become a hit.

The book does not have an index, but the notes at the end of the book contain some economic information which was useful for the author's Marxist theories.  The recent election of George W. Bush to a second term with a majority of the votes cast makes an outbreak of revolutionary civil war within the United States seem highly unlikely anytime soon, but a belated consideration of A TRACT ON MONETARY REFORM by J. M. Keynes (1923) suggests that a working class view of the state of the global economy with an eye to the future is in order.<br /><br />Goff's first book, HIDEOUS DREAM, was about his participation in the American occupation of Haiti.  One of the most brilliant things in FULL SPECTRUM DISORDER is his use of that perspective.  \\"The Haitians say, the higher the monkey climbs the tree, the more you see nothing but his ass.\\"  (p. 85).  Eventually his \\"the more all you can see is his ass\\" view comes to dominate the analysis which Antonio Gramsci called \\"the basis of the new type of intellectual.\\"  (p. 184).  Goff became familiar with Samuel P. Huntington's ideas, `a creepy theory of \\"military professionalism\\" and the \\"civil-military relationship\\" ' (p. 187) while teaching West Point freshman after he was relieved of his Delta Force duties and his security clearance was suspended on Thanksgiving Day, 1986.  (p. 186).  Goff only mentions it in passing in emphasizing `the actual experience of the people behind the wretched Special Ops mystique.  In our case, these are the experiences of enlisted people who in many ways transgressed the invisible boundary between enlisted people and the credentialed \\"managers of violence.\\" '  (p. 189).  More as a former private, drafted when I first started to attend Harvard Law School in 1968, than as the sergeant I briefly became in Nam, this is the point in this book at which I felt closest to the author.<br /><br />Capitalist political economy has grown fat on the idea that economic growth provides the wherewithal to imagine a brighter future.  Currently, our prosperity depends on a global economy which sucks up American dollars, as Goff earlier demonstrated:  \\"But this meant that the U.S. could pay for oil in money that it could print, which it did--a practice that would normally devalue the currency in an open market, were it not for the fact that that same devaluation would now wipe out creditors like Europe. . . .  They know the U.S. will never pay back its debt, . . .\\" (p. 156).  Individual workers seem to start out working for nickels and dimes, compared to the dollars which signify real wealth, but by the time they reach retirement, dollars are hardly worth the nickels and dimes they initially made.  Investment for retirement might make sense for professionals whose salaries reflect the levels enjoyed in peak times by top earners, but a great number of people living in poverty with numerous children, step-children, and apart from first wives or steady handouts, are unlikely to strike it rich in any investment program.  Constant attention to the income of the top one percent of the population, or those who make more than $200,000 per year, as lawmakers, lawyers, and accountants are most likely to consider worthy of financial consideration, most likely captures what the people in Haiti seeing a monkey up in a tree are likely to notice.<br /><br />Even if interest rates start rising to try to catch inflation, the actual state of the American economy, with pharmaceutical companies making enormous profits compared to other top corporations, executives raking in millions while cutting retirement obligations by pushing workers into early retirement, etc., the problems suggest why Goff sees the need for \\"getting grounded in historical materialism and the labor theory of value, the key components, along with class struggle, of the Marxist challenge to the bourgeois episteme.\\"  (p. 204).  The global economy has found an outsourcing solution for the labor theory of value, and modernity seems to be looking for ways that people can avoid economic thought entirely.  Certainly the recent presidential campaigns suggested that no one on either side could demonstrate an ability to actually do the numbers for anything larger than 200 billion dollars per single project, as the war on terror is definitely not.  Initiative is the overriding driving force in military operations, as Goff admits in numerous places, and a majority of American voters decided to continue with those operations that currently have some momentum going, but the ability of these people to guard anything that is highly explosive was an issue that only William Safire might call a keeper.rgeois episteme.\\"  (p. 204).

At the end of CD 2, I was wondering who Dukakis had selected as a running mate in 1988 after the comic assertion that a famous commercial on Willie Horton had caused Dukakis to replace Horton as his running mate.  This is a brilliant comic reflection of how jokes are the form of mental activity that stick in the mind as the years go by.  The original George Bush had picked Dan Quayle as his running mate, and Quayle became the subject of humorous jests, even to his face, as when in the Vice Presidential debate in 1988, a Senator from Texas, whose name had slipped from my memory for as long as it took to start an internet search, famously said something like, \\"I knew John Kennedy.  John Kennedy was a friend of mine, and you, Senator Quayle, are no John Kennedy.\\"<br /><br />Hearing the voices of founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson is an old joke left from \\"A Thousand Clowns,\\" which might be an old movie that would be good to see again about now.  One of the character's pictures on the back cover, Ed Helms, seems to have the same name as a former president of New Zealand and a judge, and it seems unfair that anything said on this CD would be linked to real people by the strange coincidence that what you get to listen to are the wild ideas of a comedian who has the same name, then attributed to the wrong person.  I happen to be at the point between the CDs when I was expecting more examples of notoriously bad political commercials but CD-2 ended.  Everything that is wrong with this kind of comedy is even worse when it forms the basis for the kind of commercials that used to be considered desperate tactics by failing candidates, but which have become so successful (according to CD-2, polls, and a TV interview at the end of the movie \\"Wag the Dog\\") that currently political campaigns use them as the norm, and also lately, the big winner has uncommonly vitriolic friends with even more money that create books, movies, and commercials which don't have to tell you who to vote for.<br /><br />Samantha Bee occasionally has a female voice part on the CD version of this book.  The greatest contrast early on is something about a dispute between England and Americans about the tax on tea (a hot beverage in those days), which is reported on seriously for a minute, but then her thoughts reflect typical warrior vernacular so accurately that letting a woman say those things is great genderfarce.  Diversityfarce gets great results when the list of minorities on the United States Supreme Court includes one homosexual.  Comedy is perfect for that kind of assertion because only certain people might know if there is any truth in such statements (I didn't try an internet search on that question), and nothing generates laughter like a big secret that is revealed by someone who wouldn't be expected to know such things.  Comments about who was putting sodomy back in the closet didn't register well with me because I usually avoid heavy involvement in that issue, but there must be lawyers for these people who have to keep track.y, the big winner has uncommonly vitriolic friends with even more money that create books, movies, and commercials which don't have to tell you who to vote for.<br /><br />Samantha Bee occasionally has a female voice part on the CD version of this book.

Robert Bly has attempted to arrange the poets in the order in which he discovered them.  The index only lists poems, not important people, but Bly's comments include incredible intellectual connections to this work, such as, \\"Ludwig Wittgenstein knew that Trakl was a genius, and he set aside money for Trakl through a patron,\\"  (p. 138).  I consider Wittgenstein important in this book because the relationship between philosophy and silence is expressed so well in the final verse of the poem \\"The Twelve Lies\\" by Rumi (1204-1273):<br /><br />So just keep silent, and if anyone says to you,<br /><br />\\"No communion takes place without words,\\" just say to him,<br /><br />\\"I heard that lie.\\"  (p. 347).<br /><br />There are 14 poems by Rumi in this book, in the first of which:<br /><br />The kind of love we know of is too great for sober reason  (p. 334).<br /><br />The basic problem of philosophy is stated well in the fifth verse of \\"The Twelve Lies\\"  :<br /><br />Daydreamers with sluggish eyes say,<br /><br />\\"Your poems and your teaching stories are nothing but daydreams.\\"<br /><br />I heard that lie.  (p. 346).<br /><br />David Koresh, who was briefly famous before he died near Waco, Texas on April 19, 1993, had an exalted image of himself as a prophet much like the seventh verse :<br /><br />They say, \\"The keeper of secrets never tells<br /><br />A single secret except to an intermediary.\\"<br /><br />People love that lie.  (p. 346).<br /><br />The first verse might be considered a poetic attempt to state a joke that could be fundamental to the nature of my own unfinished project, MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK:<br /><br />People say, \\"The one you love is unfaithful.\\"<br /><br />That's the first lie.  (p. 346).<br /><br />At its worst, poetry can suggest words randomly put together in a way that might mean something in another language, but which we read with an apprehensiveness that makes us feel like a line in this book:<br /><br />The immense treeless plains of the human brain have gotten folded and refolded  'til they are the size of a fist.

Like bitter cold	There are actually two books which play an important part in this play.  THE RETREAT FROM MOSCOW is a hardcover prop the husband carries around in the opening scene, reading from it whenever he wants to express anything about surviving a bitter cold catastrophe.  His wife is producing an anthology of poetry which is still in notebook form, with a few loose pages lying on the floor in the living room area of the stage to be arranged in some order for the final manuscript stage.  She quotes poetry that will surpass the knowledge of most people in the audience, but those of us who try to see the emotional point of it every time she starts spouting something completely different are in danger of getting lost in the multiplicity of words and insights.  The third character is a 32-year-old unmarried son who drives down to see his folks the weekend before their 33rd wedding anniversary.  He is surprised when his dad tells him the marriage is going to break up immediately, and nothing that anyone can do is going to change his mind about that.  The son is the main go-between for his parents.  In one scene, he even has his dad's new phone number but won't give it to his mom, who does not want a divorce, and when he offers to dial the phone so she can talk to her estranged husband, she has an emotional *Don't*patronize*me* response that makes her the real Napoleon in this theatrical version of The Retreat From Moscow.  All of the characters get put through the wringer in quick scenes which progress steadily toward the three people getting over it.  Death is a theme that hovers over the dramatic moments as a unique possibility that is finally just laughable.  A few lines from \\"Dover Beach\\" by Matthew Arnold were part of the poem I knew best in this play, though it did not get to the end where everything is compared to ignorant armies clashing by night.  Reading the book might be better than seeing the play if you are so interested in the poems that you would like to know them all better than I ever will.ll better than I ever will.	2004-10-28

John Stuart Mill was born on 29 May 1806 and died 8 May 1873, already old and famous in England and Ireland about when the young Nietzsche became a professor and started publishing his early works.  James Mill must have learned Greek so he could read the original version of the Bible when he was studying to be a Scotch Presbyterian minister, but he didn't become a minister.  He started to teach is eldest son, John Stuart Mill, Greek at the age of three.  The AUTOBIOGRAPHY pictures the father and son working side by side until the father was appointed to a post as Assistant Examiner of India Correspondence in 1819, often attempting to follow suggestions of David Ricardo (1772-1823).  John Stuart Mill learned to compare the ideas of Ricardo and Adam Smith at such a young age that his ideals easily rose above levels of thought that would be considered common.  \\"Believers shrink from every train of ideas which would lead the mind to a clear conception and an elevated standard of excellence, because they feel (even when they do not distinctly see) that such a standard would conflict with many of the dispensations of nature, and with much of what they are accustomed to consider as the Christian creed.  And thus morality continues a matter of blind tradition, with no consistent principle, nor even any consistent feeling, to guide it.\\"  (Chapter II.  1813-21  Moral Influences in Early Years.  My Father's Character and Opinions).<br /><br />The most honest portion of the book is Chapter V.  1826-32  A Crisis in my Mental History.  One Stage Onward.  Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) had provided Mill with the desire \\"to be a reformer of the world.\\"  \\"But the time came when I awakened from this as from a dream.  It was in the autumn of 1826.\\"  I consider this a modern intellectual reaction, and was most interested in his early attention to \\"The results of association.\\" . . . \\"the strongest possible associations of the salutary class ; associations of pleasure . . . intense associations of pain and pleasure, . . .  But there must always be something artificial and casual in associations thus produced.\\"  His activities continued, but \\"this is the only year of which I remember next to nothing.\\"  Modern mass communication has surrounded us with so much stimulus that it is difficult to picture many people getting through their lives without having every year end up like that.  Nietzsche had an early friendship with Wagner and numerous books to keep reminding him who he was or what he thought that he ought to become, but the biographies of those who have lived since then lack the basic significance that we ought to expect of anyone capable of changing the minds in the world since Albert Einstein became the great thinker.<br /><br />Chapter VII.  1840-70  General Review of the Remainder of my Life, provides many political points which are still worth pondering.  Current politics in America strongly in favor of a rich aristocracy, mightily in favor of winning a war on terrorism in battles far from home, I consider possibly as short-sighted as the interest of England in supporting the Confederacy in Civil War in America.  Here I should let John Stuart Mill explain:<br /><br />\\"But the generation which had extorted Negro emancipation from the West India planters had passed away ;  another had succeeded which had not learnt by many years of discussion and exposure to feel strongly the enormities of slavery ;  and the inattention habitual with Englishmen to whatever is going on in the world outside their own island, made them profoundly ignorant of all the antecedents of the struggle, insomuch that it was not generally believed in England, for the first year or two of the war, that the quarrel was one of slavery.  There were men of high principle and unquestionable liberality of opinion, who thought it a dispute about tariffs, or assimilated it to the cases in which they were accustomed to sympathize, of a people struggling for independence.\\"<br /><br />\\" . . .  when there occurred, towards the end of 1861, the seizure of the Southern envoys on board a British vessel, by an officer of the United States.  Even English forgetfulness has not yet had time to lose all remembrance of the explosion of feeling in England which then burst forth, the expectation, which prevailed for some weeks, of war with the United States, and the warlike preparations actually commenced on this side.\\"<br /><br />John Stuart Mill did what he could to keep daily events from turning into a war which would have split the United States permanently.  He was later lucky to be elected to Parliament even though \\"it was, and is, my fixed conviction, that a candidate ought not to incur one farthing of expense for undertaking a public duty.\\"  \\"I said further, that if elected, I could not undertake to give any of my time and labour to their local interests. . . .  I made known to them, among other things, my conviction (as I was bound to do, since I intended, if elected, to act on it), that women were entitled to representation in Parliament on the same terms with men.\\"  He often won by being right on the merits.  \\"My position in the House was further improved by a speech in which I insisted on paying off the National Debt before our coal supplies are exhausted, and by an ironical reply to some Tory leaders who had quoted . . . my `Considerations on Representative Government,' which said that the Conservative party was, by the law of its composition, the stupidest party.\\"o sympathize, of a people struggling for independence.\\"<br /><br />\\" . . .  when there occurred, towards the end of 1861, the seizure of the Southern envoys on board a British vessel, by an officer of the United States.

The picture on the cover and at the front of the book shows Thomas Mann wearing glasses, a white shirt, bow tie, and suit jacket, holding a pen and papers in his final year at eighty in June 1955, near Zurich, Switzerland, where he had lived since 1952.  Poems by Schiller and Goethe are printed in German, with a utilitarian attempt to provide English verse translations that conform to the German text.<br /><br />Americans began to take serious interest in the works of Nietzsche in the 1950's, and Mann's essay is called \\"Nietzsche's Philosophy in the Light of Recent History.\\"  The first serious comparison is of Nietzsche with Hamlet.  \\"Its central factor is tragic pity for an overburdened soul, a soul upon whom too many charges have been laid -- one only called to knowledge, but not really born for it and, like Hamlet, shattered by it; a delicate, fine, warmhearted soul in need of love, formed for noble friendships and not at all made for solitude. . . .  This mind was compelled to violate its own nature, to become the mouthpiece and advocate of blatant brute force, of the callous conscience, of Evil itself.\\"  (p. 142).<br /><br />\\"Dr. Paul Julius Mõbius has been severely censured for having written a book in which he described Nietzsche's development as a case history in progressive syphilis.  I have never been able to share this censure.  In his own fashion the good doctor has told the incontestable truth.\\"  (p. 144).  \\"With complete naïvet&eacute; Nietzsche glorified the blissful obverse of his disease, those euphoric compensations and overcompensations which are part of the clinical picture.\\"  (p. 147).  The link Nietzsche projects between such states and feelings of inspiration might illustrate how well brilliant nationalistic politicians in recent history excited entire nations to take part in global ambitions with little regard for the consequences, but Thomas Mann seems a bit slow to make this comparison.  `What he is \\"in truth\\" describing -- but what is truth, the experience or the medical interpretation? -- is a dangerous condition of over-stimulation which ironically precedes tertiary-luetic collapse.'  (p. 148).<br /><br />As a whole, Nietzsche's life and work are appreciated as a series of steps:  first, a passionate relationship with Richard Wagner (p. 150), \\"He remained Schopenhauer's disciple long after he had rejected his master;\\" (p. 151), \\"Invocation of the drunken god occurs first in the mystical aesthetic work of his youth, THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY FROM THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC,\\" (p. 152), which was followed by \\"His brilliant diatribe against the smug and senile book by a theologian, David Friedrich Strauss,\\" (p. 153).  At that point, Nietzsche was openly attacking public opinion in Germany, and Mann proclaimed, \\"Nietzsche already knows in the depths of his heart that he will do his utmost, not stopping short of madness, to infuriate the philistines.\\"  (p. 153).<br /><br />Discussing the philosophy of Nietzsche, Mann mentions \\"All that he formerly called Socratism\\" in comparison with \\"vain tilts against morality with which, at approximately the same time, Oscar Wilde was shocking and amusing his public.\\"  (p. 157).  The philosophy gets pretty deep before Mann finally reaches the current historical condition.  \\"Far more pressing is the danger that life on this planet may abolish itself by means of the atom bomb.  But that, too, is unlikely.  Life is a cat with many lives, and so is humanity.\\"  (p. 162).<br /><br />That might seem like a brief interval in this essay, but our history stills shows the triumph of \\"A gang of megalomaniacal petty bourgeois, the very sight of whom would have nauseated Nietzsche.\\"  (p. 163).  Nietzsche was inclined tosee that \\"Life is an outgrowth of war; society itself is an instrument of war.\\"  (p. 164).  Mann and history are ready to contradict him with how much more we have seen \\"-- and how can we not see? -- the destruction, ruin, and corruption engendered by even a war waged for humanity, the demoralization, the unleashing of every brutal, selfish, and antisocial instinct;\\"  (pp. 164-165).  But Nietzsche was already expecting as much \\"with a voluptuous zest\\" (p. 165).  I appreciate Nietzsche for saying so because this seems to be the part of modern warfare that is always already unthunk in the statements of the polite advocates of the kill and win strategy.  Mann's emphasis on how Nietzsche \\"alarms us for the sanity of the noble mind which is here raging so lustfully against itself\\" (p. 165) fails to affirm how raging becomes a normal response when people have a lot to fear.  My senator, Mark Dayton of Minnesota, is closing an office in Washington, D.C. because of special dangers he associates with that place just before an election, and citizens are calling that giving in to fear.

Perhaps everyone who guesses them is destroyed.\\"  A former two-term Senator from Minnesota, Paul Wellstone, died shortly before an election in 2002, and the booing at his funeral was maddening to some people.  Recent history, or wild imagination?  \\"I would say not that Nietzsche created fascism, but that fascism created him.\\"  (p. 167).

Most of the stories which appear on pages 169 to 478 of HENRY JAMES REPRESENTATIVE SELECTIONS, WITH INTRODUCTION, BIBLIOGRAPHY, AND NOTES BY LYON N. RICHARDSON (1941, 1966) can also be found in THE NOVELS AND STORIES OF HENRY JAMES (New and Complete Edition, 35 vols., London:  Macmillan and Co., 1921-1923) and the earlier THE NOVELS AND TALES OF HENRY JAMES (26 vols., New York:  Charles Scribner's Sons, 1907-1917) which was the result of a \\"Three-year task of revising his works thoroughly\\"  (p. CXXV) begun in 1905, according to the Chronological Table which lists his birth in 1843 and death in 1916.  This book does not have an index, so it is not easy to look up concepts like `free association' to see how he characterized various intellectual pursuits as examples of that technique before its meaning was set in a psychoanalytical framework by Freud, but reading the book carefully provides a wholesome picture of what intellectual life could be like before most of the worst years of the 20th century.<br /><br />Henry James was more aware of other writers of his own time than people of today might expect.  When he was only 22 years and 7 months old, his review of DRUM-TAPS (1865) by Walt Whitman appeared in the NATION, November 16, 1865.  As printed in this book (pp. 3-8), the review has ten paragraphs; the first is on \\"a melancholy task.\\"  The second already looks beyond the book by Whitman to declare that a poet \\"is really a poet only in so far as he extracts its latent meaning and holds it up to common eyes.\\"  The third states the obvious:  \\"Mr. Whitman is very fond of blowing his own trumpet,\\" and follows with verse to prove it.  In the fourth, \\"These are great pretensions, but it seems to us that the following are even greater:\\" is used to introduce another fifteen lines by Whitman.  The conclusion soon reached by Henry James is, \\"It is monstrous because it pretends to persuade the soul while it slights the intellect; because it pretends to gratify the feelings while it outrages the taste.\\"  (p. 6).<br /><br />A serious review of Ivan Turgenev from 1874 follows on pages 9-41, followed by a chapter from a book on Hawthorne on pages 42-74, primarily on THE SCARLET LETTER to p. 55, THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES to p. 63, and THE BLITHEDALE ROMANCE.<br /><br />\\"The Art of Fiction\\" on pages 75 to 97 was published in 1888, the last year in which Nietzsche wrote real books, though he is not listed with \\"those who have worked in this field with equal glory.  Do not think too much about optimism and pessimism; try and catch the color of life itself.\\"  (p. 97).  Also from 1888, \\"The Life of George Eliot\\" comments on a biography by Mr. Cross based on letters and journals described \\"as of a person talking without raising her voice\\" (p. 114) which were \\"only a partial expression of her spirit, but they are evidently as full an expression as it was capable of giving itself when she was not wound up to the epic pitch.\\"  (p. 98).<br /><br />Also in 1888, \\"Emerson\\" (pp. 116-138) was based on Henry James' reading of A MEMOIR OF RALPH WALDO EMERSON by James Elliot Cabot.  As a life it seemed empty:  paleness, vacancy, quiet, extreme discretion, a long process of refining, only mildly suggestive of the changes that Nietzsche felt coming in values:<br /><br />\\"They were so provincial as to think brilliancy came ill recommended, and they were shocked at his ceasing to care for the prayer and the sermon.  They might have perceived that he was the prayer and the sermon:  not in the least a secularizer, but in his own subtle insinuating way a sanctifier.\\"  (p. 119)<br /><br />Emerson was not apt to be shocking.  \\"It was only because he was so deferential that he could be so detached; he had polished his aloofness till it reflected the image of his solicitor.\\"  (p. 127).  He lived ina society which was afraid to value anything else more highly.  \\"This was conspicuous to the writer of these remarks on the occasion of the curious, sociable, cheerful public funeral made for him in 1883 by all the countryside, arriving, as for the last honors to the first citizen, in trains, in wagons, on foot, in multitudes.  It was a popular manifestation, the most striking I have ever seen provoked by the death of a man of letters.\\"  (p. 131).<br /><br />\\"&Eacute;mile Zola\\" on pages 139-168 about the great French novelist, was originally published in 1914.  One big problem:  \\"There is simply no limit, in fine, to the misfortune of being tasteless; it does not merely disfigure the surface and fringe of your performance--it eats back into the very heart and enfeebles the sources of life.\\"  (p. 157).<br /><br />I was primarily interested in this book because of the story, \\"The Real Thing\\" on pages 380-407, originally published in 1893.  The narrator of the story is much like \\"George du Maurier (1834-1896), the famous English illustrator whose popularity as a novelist during his last years had just begun\\"  (p. 489).  The distinguished couple who appear at the door of the artist at the beginning of the story couldn't afford an oil portrait of themselves, but were willing to sit as models when the artist \\"worked in black and white, for magazines, for storybooks, for sketches of contemporary life, and consequently had copious employment for models.\\"  (p. 382).  In a society in which certain people get rich in advertisements for a soap vendor, the couple had high hopes.

Darrow also wrote articles and gave talks on political issues of the day.  VERDICTS OUT OF COURT collects items from 1895 to 1936, divides the items into seven subject areas, and includes an Introduction by Arthur and Lila Weinberg dated March, 1963, which praises Darrow for publicly representing \\"more cases for the weak and poor than any other lawyer in America,\\" (p. 35) as Darrow himself put it, in a case in which he was charged with jury tampering in California.  Mild contradictions abound in his life.  He proclaimed that he was always for peace and love in his own case, but Germany offended his sensibilities so much by invading Belgium and France that he joined the popular opinion that \\"I am thoroughly convinced that not only was it right of America to enter this war, but it was her duty, if she recognizes duty, and that had she stayed out she would have been so cowardly that she would have received and deserved the contempt of all the right-thinking people of the world.\\"  (p. 343).<br /><br />Darrow's book, CRIME:  ITS CAUSE AND TREATMENT, was published two years before he defended Leopold and Loeb, who were so young and rich that Darrow had to transfer his concern for the weak and poor to some who weren't.  \\"In a terrible crisis there is only one element more helpless than the poor, and that is the rich.\\"  (p. 40).  Americans in Chicago were sure they could legally do something terrible to young people who botch their first murder and kidnapping crime, but Darrow tried to make the court seem like it was giving them a fair deal.<br /><br />\\"After several weeks' deliberation Judge Caverly sentenced Leopold and Loeb to ninety-nine years plus life.  Twelve years later, Loeb was killed in a prison fight.  In March, 1958, on the twentieth anniversary of Darrow's death, a rehabilitated fifty-two-year-old Nathan Leopold was paroled from the state penitentiary at Joliet, Illinois.\\"  (p. 41).<br /><br />Some things have changed in the last hundred years, but the topics presented in this book hit some current interests.  When he was invited to address the Sixth Annual Meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington, D.C., on April 20, 1928, he was told to abuse the newspapers and he said, \\"I can't do it adequately.\\"  (p. 401).  This was before American bombers were famous in enemy countries for dropping bombs on television stations that dared to propagandize against whichever side the Americans were on, but he does a pretty good job of describing how nobody believes what they read in the press, but they don't know anything else anyway.  \\"They know only one thing:  get the public angry so they will kill somebody or increase the term of servitude.  That resulted the other day in the state of Michigan sending a man to the penitentiary for life for having a pint of whiskey in his possession.\\"  (p. 405).<br /><br />\\"Newspapers are not alone in this.  We are all natural joiners.  I never joined anything except the Elks.  I joined the Elks because in the early days it was about the only place where you could get a drink in a small town.

US	44184384	RGZKT7IDNEDLJ	0231070837	410581451	Marine Lover of Friedrich Nietzsche (European Perspectives S)	Books	2	1	27	N	N	Difficult, maybe preposterous, with few comic triumphs	The first thing that I am likely to notice about a book is whether it has an index.  This book has no index.  I have the 1991 English translation by Gillian C. Gill of Luce Irigaray's book MARINE LOVER OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE in paperback, and between pages 75 and 119, the only indication at the top of the page to show what this part is about are the words, \\"Veiled Lips.\\"  This is not too surprising for a book that seems to be mainly about the attractions of Nietzsche's ideas because it builds on a section of SPURS / NIETZSCHE'S STYLES by Jacques Derrida called `Veils' in which truth is compared to woman as \\"Nietzsche revives that barely allegorical figure (of woman) in his own interest.  For him, truth is like a woman.  It resembles the veiled movement of feminine modesty.  Their complicity, the complicity (rather than the unity) between woman, life, seduction, modesty--all the veiled and veiling effects . . .\\"  (SPURS, p. 51).<br /><br />Fortunately, there is an index in WOMANIZING NIETZSCHE / PHILOSOPHY'S RELATION TO THE FEMININE by Kelly Oliver, and \\"Veiled Lips\\" even appears in her index, for a discussion of this book in a chapter on Jacques Derrida (3  The Question of Appropriation).  Kelly Oliver suggests, \\"Irigaray's criticism could be seen as a lesson in psychoanalytic theory.\\"  (Womanizing Nietzsche, p. 81).  The theory here is not as interesting to me as the possibility of gaining a woman's perspective on a point at which philosophy seems to be close to humor, if modern comedy is recognized in the playful manner in which Derrida explains the great question \\"Supposing truth to be a woman--what?\\" found at the opening of Nietzsche's BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL. His translation gains clarity by emphasizing a term of contempt:  \\". . . all philosophers, when they have been dogmatists, have had little understanding of women . . . [and] the gruesome earnestness, the clumsy importunity with which they have been in the habit of approaching truth have been inept and improper means (ungeschickte und unschickliche Mittel) for winning a wench (Frauenzimmer is a term of contempt:  an easy woman)?\\"  (SPURS, p. 55).<br /><br />Do I need to be forgiven for such a rude interruption?  By emphasizing the comic aspects of modern society, I often make myself feel that I am interrupting people who have far more serious concerns.  This could be a good time for appreciating the earnest efforts of a woman to meet Nietzsche halfway on ideas which he chose, as Luce Irigaray attempts to do in MARINE LOVER OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.  The section `Veiled Lips' opens with a few paragraphs containing words that might be found in joking about which lips are meant:  \\"if not its accessories and its underside.  And the opposite remains caught up in the same. . . .  With a flip of the coin,\\"  (p. 77).  She knew what Nietzsche's laughter was:  \\"And you laughed at having been so blindly trusting.  And burned as you reclaimed the flames once devoted to their cult.\\"  (p. 53).  I have not usually been too concerned with the interpretation which might be placed upon Nietzsche by typical modern scholarship, such as it is, but the problem of the education of women looms large in trying to understand what moderns might consider the worst things he wrote.<br /><br />Nietzsche had excelled in school in studies of the ancient Greeks, and he was made a professor at the age of 24 in 1869 so he could teach Greek ideas to boys in an educational system that was primarily about dead European males.  His first book, THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY, praised the Greeks as surviving from one culture to another:<br /><br />\\"And so one feels ashamed and afraid in the presence of the Greeks, unless one prizes truth above all things and dares acknowledge even this truth:  that the Greeks, as charioteers, hold in their hands the reins of our own and every other culture, but that almost always chariot and horses are of inferior quality and not up to the glory of their leaders, who consider it sport to run such a team into an abyss which they themselves clear with the leap of Achilles.\\"  (BIRTH OF TRAGEDY, section 15, Kaufmann translation, p. 94).<br /><br />Taking such a long view of things hardly helps the modern student who is looking for something useful, but this book is not likely to find readers for whom it accomplishes much.  Women having equal access to such an education could hardly fail to make their own proclamations about what might be worth knowing, and the chaos of modern society gets boosted for diversity in the process, but my personal theme of praising the hemlock which Athens granted Socrates as a sentence for engaging in philosophy is not too wild to be found in this book, even where it is not stated explicitly.  \\"What are you unable to abandon?  What place are you unwilling to leave?  What weight always holds you back at the same point?  The will to live or to die? . . .  Because to receive, without swallowing up what has been given to you . . .\\"  (p. 42).<br /><br />\\"Socrates desiring death, and achieving it thanks to a drink given to him by the citizens, signifies his allegiance to the Dionysiac.  It is by this means that he will take away its power. . . . the death `for a laugh' of the philosopher whose potion is the logos.\\"  (p. 98).<br /><br />I probably left out the best parts (for everybody but me), but by cherrypicking a few themes and some indication of who might consider this book important, some people might get the idea that guys aren't likely to do great in the humanities anyway, so why try?un such a team into an abyss which they themselves clear with the leap of Achilles.\\"  (BIRTH OF TRAGEDY, section 15, Kaufmann translation, p. 94).<br /><br />Taking such a long view of things hardly helps the modern student who is looking for something useful, but this book is not likely to find readers for whom it accomplishes much.

THE MYTH OF THE GREAT WAR by John Mosier, subtitled A NEW MILITARY HISTORY OR WORLD WAR I, is promoted on the cover of the hardcover edition (2001) as HOW THE GERMANS WON THE BATTLES AND HOW THE AMERICANS SAVED THE ALLIES.  At the beginning of the book, it is easy to see how forts in Belgium fell quickly under heavy artillery attacks which dropped far more high explosive shells inside their walls than any normal soldier ever expected to encounter so soon in an invasion.  Plans for French attacks developed so slowly that it is easy for this book to keep repeating how much the Germans benefited by attacking first at points where they expected to be attacked.  \\"The Argonne was a true sector of the war, never at peace, always at struggle.  But the most intense part of it occurred in the summer of 1915, when in a bloody repeat of what had happened in April in Artois, a devastating German offensive ripped into a planned French offensive.\\"  (pp. 154-155).<br /><br />The maps in the hardcover edition are by Robert Laurent, located within the body of the text on 12 pages.  The first six maps are important for the events of 1914, first near Liege and Namur in Belgium, then from the French coast (English Channel) to Verdun and Saint-Mihiel near the German border.  There must be a mistake in the date 15 June 1914 on the map on page 76, because the Germans did not have front lines just east of Ypres, Belgium, or Arras and Amiens, France, before the war started.  The map of the British Sector 1915-1918 on page 230 (where Lille seems to be about 50 kilometers from Ypres or Arras, twice as far as shown by the scale of the other map) shows a Passchendaele 1917 line which is not quite in the same place.  This book places much emphasis on how erroneous initial reports of military action in this area were, particularly when the French were attempting to proclaim as many victories as possible.  A newspaper reporter who knew the area might be able to see many military positions outside the forests from an airplane, but no one was brave enough to attempt anything that might result in a report of information that would be considered secret by either side, and any plane counting bunches of German heavy artillery was certain to be considered a spy and shot down by a red baron.  This book is mainly about the war on the ground, where most of the casualties were a result of artillery barrages.  The French and British expected the Germans to lose more soldiers than they did, and Winston Churchill is praised for being one of the few authors who wrote about the number of actual casualties.  Airplanes do not get mentioned until a French attack is compared with the American effort that finally succeeded years after the French failed to budge the German position.  \\"In August 1918, when the AEF finally got the salient back, Pershing committed over 3,000 artillery pieces, 1,400 planes, 267 tanks, and 660,000 men to the offensive.\\"  (p. 145).  With so many little planes buzzing over whatever was going on, it is not surprising that Americans would expect accurate reports from anyone who did not suffer too much from an earlier opinion of that war.<br /><br />The Germans were good at digging in, which provided them with good protection from most attacks, but I was surprised at the use of underground explosives similar to a surreptitious attack on the Beatles in the Movie `Help.'  There was a church in ruins but still held by the Germans at the highest elevation of the Vauquois butte, until the French blew it up with a twelve-ton mine on 23 March 1916, \\"turning the highest point into a gigantic crater.  Two months later, on 4 May 1916, the Germans set off sixty tons of explosives underneath the French lines at the southeast end of the butte.  The resulting crater, thirty meters deepand one hundred meters in diameter, buried 108 French soldiers from the 46th Infantry Regiment, along with an equivalent amount of the French line.\\"  (p. 138).  Ultimately, of a thousand metric tons of explosives used in 520 underground detonations, the French used 664 tons in 320 explosions.  (p. 139).<br /><br />Having much better resources at the beginning of the war in August 1914, when it acquired the most industrial part of France, Germany was able to occupy new territories in each year of the war.  \\"Belgium in 1914, Serbia in 1915, Rumania in 1916, Italy in 1917, and at the end of 1917, Russia as well.  Whenever the Germans could throw the resources together to mount a major offensive operation in the West, it was successful.\\"  (p. 5).  America was far enough away at the beginning to avoid having a large number of officers killed.  When Pershing arrived in France in June 1917, he quickly called for a million men to be assembled in France by May 1918 near the German border.  A great German offensive of March 1918 tried to win the war before July.  The British had their troops on the front line and were quickly overrun.  When American troops began to battle in June, the Marines did not have as much censorship, \\"So in the ensuing battle, the Marine brigade got all the publicity, even though the army brigade did just as much fighting.\\"  (p. 321).  Even as the Germans retreated from territory they had gained (July through November 1918) the British were losing \\"over one hundred thousand men killed, while French figures came to 161,000, and American to about sixty thousand.\\"  (p. 328).  Sometimes the American army is the best side to be on, even if it gets censored.and one hundred meters in diameter, buried 108 French soldiers from the 46th Infantry Regiment, along with an equivalent amount of the French line.\\"  (p. 138).

US	44184384	R1H2KID7MSHAAS	1592700160	590303921	Philosophy: 100 Essential Thinkers	Books	4	3	27	N	N	Seriously scratches the surface	This book uses a monumentally biographical way to sum up what we know of philosophy.  Individuals sometimes possess great charm, and being able to think better, faster, more, etc. than anyone else can be quite attractive.  Unfortunately, we live in such a comic society that philosophy can only maintain its seriousness by sneaking off into a corner where it pays as little attention to everything else as possible.  A quick comparison with how popular fun things like a song by The Cars called `You Might Think' could be, or used to be, in the case of The Cars, shows how this book approaches philosophers the way a humorous rock 'n' roll song attempts to capture its listeners:<br /><br />you might think it's foolish<br /><br />or maybe it's untrue<br /><br />you might think I'm crazy<br /><br />but all I want is you  (Written by Ric Ocasek, 1983)<br /><br />Before comedians could make more money writing movies and songs than books, some were so frustrated that they wrote about philosophy.  At first I thought an intelligently comical review of PHILOSOPHY 100 ESSENTIAL THINKERS would have to top the book itself by showing how comic most stories about the old masters in the tradition of LIVES FROM PLUTARCH have been.  Some of those old books have been in the library so long that just allowing books like that one to automatically fall open to the place where it has been read most often reveals the funniest places.  It would be even more challenging to show how modern media allow individuals to achieve fame for a range of achievements that make the limited scope of philosophy all but disappear, utterly surrounded by all the newer possibilities, but PHILOSOPHY 100 ESSENTIAL THINKERS by Philip Stokes doesn't have an index, so it would take a tremendous level of familiarity with the book just to get started on that project.<br /><br />Fortunately for the rest of the world, this is just a review, and what I know about music is Schopenhauer played flute.  I also have a CD of things Nietzsche played on the piano before he discovered that he was not going to be a composer.  As my interest in the song, `You Might Think' should indicate, I am interested in music because it allows an individual to express ideas in a form in which the composer actually imagines having some impact on listeners, a concept which becomes more unlikely with each passing hour, or even one more verse:<br /><br />you might think it's hysterical<br /><br />but i know when you're weak<br /><br />you think you're in the movies<br /><br />and everything's so deep<br /><br />but i think that you're wild<br /><br />when you flash that fragile smile<br /><br />you might think it's foolish<br /><br />what you put me through<br /><br />you might think i'm crazy<br /><br />but all i want is you.<br /><br />Philip Stokes manages to find the opposite lesson in the works of Schopenhauer.  \\"In music and the arts we can contemplate the universal will apart from our own individual strivings.\\"  (p. 105).  This was before individuals found a way to soundtrack everywhere they might be going, and it was discovered that people had limits to what they were willing to listen to 24/7.  Contemplation has been of far more use to philosophers than to anyone else, and it is difficult to imagine anything that the 100 Essential Thinkers in this book have been essential for, other than a history of interesting thoughts.  Nietzsche once thought about writing this kind of book about the pre-Platonic philosophers, which takes this book up to page 21.  Given the basic information, the question of how useful such a book might become kept him from proceeding further.<br /><br />There are some real scientists in this book: the mathematician Pythagoras, astronomers Copernicus and Galileo, Sir Isaac Newton, naturalist Charles Darwin, psychoanalysts Freud and Jung, economist John Maynard Keynes, linguists Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky, but the closer this book gets to the present, the more controversiesabout science expressed by writers like Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn become important to how we think about things.  Sticking to a particular a particular form of evaluation gets tougher the closer we get to Burrhus Frederic Skinner (1904-1990) with his explanations of `operant conditions' (p. 201) in place of assumed psychological experiences which \\"are irrelevant to a proper scientific understanding of human behaviour.\\"  (p. 201).<br /><br />That song, `You might think,' has a bridge before the final verse:<br /><br />and it's so hard to take<br /><br />there's no escape without a scrape<br /><br />you kept it going till the sun fell down<br /><br />you kept it going<br /><br />you might think i'm delirious<br /><br />the way i run you down<br /><br />but somewhere sometime<br /><br />when you're curious<br /><br />i'll be back around . . .<br /><br />Chance put this book in my hands the same day I listened to the Heartbeat City album by The Cars, but I could give you the chorus of a really popular song from Paul Simon in 1975 to show how our society thinks, with a poke at all the people in this book:<br /><br />You just slip out the back, Jack<br /><br />Make a new plan, Stan<br /><br />You don't need to be coy, Roy<br /><br />Just get yourself free<br /><br />Hop on the bus, Gus<br /><br />You don't need to discuss much<br /><br />Just drop off the key, Lee<br /><br /> . . .about science expressed by writers like Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn become important to how we think about things.

Clark has enough experience to attempt to grapple with reality, but the title WINNING MODERN WARS seems to lack any insight into the nature of the problems that currently face the world.  America has never been good at understanding balance while it achieved excessively in modern warfare.  Even Nam, already, seemed like a waste to those who had an opportunity to observe the endless military build-up in yearly intervals that never gained much ground, particularly if the cemeteries for 243,000 South Vietnamese soldiers who died in Nam but tend to be neglected by the existing government, are counted as part of American plans for the future in the 20th century.  In the 1960's, economic growth due to the Kennedy tax cuts was supposed to supply the eternal boost to keep everything booming, but economics often fails to add up for anyone who is concerned about catastrophes of greater magnitude than a cyclical slump.  Putting \\"The American Empire\\" in the subtitle was a brave move for anyone who wants readers to face what is happening to the world, but what this book notices about economics is limited to the best that can be said about modern trends:<br /><br />`At the beginning of the twenty-first century the United States is the world's leading economy, accounting for about 20 percent of global output and, during the period 1995-2002, for about 40 percent of the world's economic growth.'  (p. 178).<br /><br />Me again:  in the world as a whole, the leading industry is tourism.  The DVD called `Life and Debt' on the situation in Jamaica shows how increasingly difficult it is for small countries to obtain any money for local activities, including health and education, after a combination of the World Bank and the IMF controls a country's flow of international currencies to allow payment of loans from the global financial institutions.  American economic controls in Iraq gave every indication, before and after sanctions were dropped, of maintaining as much control as possible, instead of allowing France, Russia, and Iran to maintain established activities.  Clark describes this \\"benefit to ordinary Americans\\" as a result produced by a financial situation in which \\"the United States must consume more than it produces--while much of the rest of the world must produce more than it consumes.\\"  (p. 178).  News from Iraq indicates that we have been particularly interested in Iraq producing oil, an item that the United States needs, but that the insurgency in Iraq has been unusually successful in preventing the United States from \\"sharing the benefits with others.\\"  (p. 178).<br /><br />Clark calls the means of our success `the American values of free-market economics and popular democracy.  Enabled by modern communication and transportation, this network facilitated access to markets and investment opportunities abroad, assisted the flow of talent and intellectual property, and fostered the spread of market forces and democratic processes around the world.  The major beneficiary of this was the United States itself.  This \\"globalization\\" was the New American Empire.'  (p. 180).  The U.S. mistakes which offended common values might be blamed mainly on the C.I.A. activities that used to be covered by plausible denial.  \\"Worried about potential Soviet encroachments into the Middle East, the United States deposed an Iranian leader and replaced him with an unpopular shah.  Siding against a Soviet-oriented India, the United States distanced itself from the world's largest democracy.  Fearing a Marxist takeover of Chile, the United States backed Chilean military action to throw out the democratically elected Marxist leader, Salvador Allende.  In Central America the United States fought for almost a decade . . .\\"  (p. 183) blamed more in this book on \\"CIA and special forces personnel\\" (p. 183) than on Oliver North, a patsy who does not even appear in the index.  Obviously the CIA had a policy then, but the world remains unconvinced that its policy regarding regime change is any different now.<br /><br />Freeing the United States from the cold war mentality allows it to engage in more idealistic fights, such as a war on drug lords, called \\"the U.S. military peace operations in the Balkans, Latin America, Africa, and Asia\\" (p. 183) which are pictured as being nobler than our cold war heritage.<br /><br />A year ago, things that could fall apart had started to show the danger:  \\"By September 2003, U.S. forces were in Iraq--deeply committed, without as yet . . . \\" (p. 184).  \\"Individually, some governments, especially democratic governments who must listen to the opinions of voters, would simply find it difficult to comply with American wishes.  Turkey, for example, refused . . .\\" (p. 185).  Part of the danger is economic.  \\"In the narrowest sense, if foreigners should lose confidence in U.S. leadership and reject the implicit understandings and economic alignments that have led them--especially the central banks of China, Taiwan, and Japan--to accumulate dollar holdings, they could quickly diversify out of dollar assets, triggering a sharp decline in the dollar's values and significantly impacting our economy.\\"  (pp. 185-186).

US	44184384	R27RCTEBQUBOSW	0060736704	717178025	Bush on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President	Books	5	51	61	N	N	Never forget that this book exists	I believe there was an incident on September 7, when the original George Bush was president in 1989 through 1992, when the elder George Bush referred to September 7th as Pearl Harbor Day, forgetting that the Japanese waited until December 7, 1941, to launch their attack on the American naval base in Hawaii.  Each year the names of the months are mostly different, though January and February end the same way, and June and July start with the same two letters, until after August, particularly since 1945, when August has a reminder of atomic warfare and the end of things, but September, November, and December sound so similar that the mind can easily skip from one to another as it searches for familiar ideas.  There is a certain poetic justice, then, in the fantastic coincidence that the younger George Bush was president on September 11, 2001, the day most likely to be remembered forever as the Pearl Harbor Day that came in September.  The very thing that the elder president Bush was fishing for in his mind became a reality during the presidency of his son, and it takes a particularly unwarlike sensitivity to declare that it is ironic for such a thing to happen to a willing warrior like the son turned out to be.  How ironic?  I'm reading from BUSH ON THE COUCH INSIDE THE MIND OF THE PRESIDENT (2004) by Justin A. Frank, M.D.:<br /><br />How ironic, then, that this child should grow up to occupy the presidency at his nation's greatest moment of grief--the period of deep shock that followed September 11, 2001.  In his post-9/11 edition of THE BUSH DYSLEXICON, Mark Crispin Miller writes perceptively of Bush's \\"apparent incapacity for any show of sorrow, at least in public.  Without a script, he seemed unable to assimilate the tragic aspect of the crisis, or even face it, but would just look right on past it to the happy, happy day of our eventual revenge.\\"  Even when Bush did pay lip service to America's grief, it was almost always supplanted immediately by expressions of anger.  \\"If this were a psychobiography,\\"  Miller writes, \\"we might look deeply into Bush's tendency to jump away from grief and straight into rage.\\"<br /><br />  And, as Miller points out, within months Bush was joking about the events of 9/11, and deciding that \\"all in all, it's been a fabulous year for Laura and me.\\"  Whatever grief there may have been appeared to have been washed from his system.  (pp. 16-17).<br /><br />I do not doubt that his grief was less because the loss of buildings in New York City and one wing of the Pentagon were not as familiar to President Bush as oil wells and planes that are capable of dropping real bombs.  In choosing Iraq as a battleground, Bush has shown an enormous capacity to project American power into an area that matters far more to those who would be America's enemies than the recent setbacks for all parties display.  As it becomes more difficult to accept Saudi Arabia as naturally our friend in this endeavor, the flight of whites from the Arabian peninsula is evidence of the tremendous enmity which it is easy for the reckless abuse of destructive power in the context of another culture to generate.  BUSH ON THE COUCH has its own political slant on the personality which would perpetuate a policy of this nature indefinitely, but it seems tone deaf to the desires of Americans who want this kind of overwhelming military superiority to draw attention away from vulnerabilities in the homeland.<br /><br />My usual complaint about Americans is that they show no interest in learning anything.  BUSH ON THE COUCH might be read as a lesson in how someone talks when he has all the answers and isn't afraid to play Bingo with the questions.  Reduced to the role of spokesman for the in-group, which is most devastating in its ability to displace onto the future the result of its limited attention span now, President Bush might even be aware that he is a walking exhibit of the shortcomings mentioned in this book, but the charming part is that he is still being considered as a human being, and the ability to give such a monstrosity a human face which has any charm is quite remarkable.<br /><br />The source notes and index at the end of the book might seem extremely simple to anyone who is used to reading scholarly texts.  Melanie Klein gets seven lines in the index, more than the six lines for Freud, because she provides more of a psychological framework for the ideas in the book than anyone else.  Saddam Hussein only gets three lines in the index, the same as authors John Dean, Al Franken, Stephen Mansfield, and Bob Woodward.  This book does not delve into philosophy, but he shows some awareness:<br /><br />Let's put it this way:  Behind the forced familiarity of his tough-guy talk was the unmistakable message that Bush feels he can \\"put it\\" to anybody, and in any way, he wants.  His threat is also an admission of his comfort with living outside the law, with what Princeton philosopher Peter Singer calls \\"killing people without any judicial process at all.\\"  As Singer has remarked, Bush \\"appeared to be proud of that fact.\\"  (pp. 112-113).<br /><br />There will probably be a record deficit in October, especially for people who do not consider Social Security payments a surplus that might reduce the 600 billion or 700 billion dollar difference between ordinary government revenues and expenditures, and an election in November, 2004, which could change the human face that America will look to for leadership, but it shouldn't be surprising that a lot of this book is about a fight with people who would rather have a theocracy than thieves of a less pious nature.at he is still being considered as a human being, and the ability to give such a monstrosity a human face which has any charm is quite remarkable.<br /><br />The source notes and index at the end of the book might seem extremely simple to anyone who is used to reading scholarly texts.

My main interest was in topics that get hardly more than a page, like furtive mentions of Luce Irigaray in his consideration of Freud's position in the landscape of feminism.  The deeper into this I look, the more I am likely to find the kind of thing that Paul Robinson would say:<br /><br />\\"I won't pretend to understand Lacan's reasoning here, or to explain how Freud's essentially preverbal infant can be reconciled with Lacan's linguistic fabrication, but one needs to recognize that within the world of Lacanian psychoanalysis the self is a symbolic creation, and the privileged symbol or `signifier' (to use his own terminology) is the phallus.  So selfhood, language, and phallic consciousness all belong to the same order of things, to the same intellectual register.\\"  (p. 269).<br /><br />I was going to say that this book shows its bravery by starting with \\"A Symposium on OPERA AND IDEAS with Bernard Williams and Peter Kivy\\" (pp. 3-29) in which the philosophers who read one of Paul Robinson's six major books had the opportunity to go first in stating their observations about what is most debatable in his work.  Peter Kivy is onto the serious Enlightenment message in Mozart's THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO, in contrast to the mocking treatment of Reason and Humanity in Rossini's THE BARBER OF SEVILLE on page 5, but later questions the essence of this argument with:<br /><br />`It is one thing for music to be shallow, another for it to \\"express\\" shallowness or anything else by being shallow.  And, in my view, the reason why THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO is moving and THE BARBER OF SEVILLE is not is solely because Mozart's music is what it is, deep and unutterably beautiful, while Rossini's is what it is, wonderfully pleasing, titillating, and shallow.  It has nothing to do with \\"content.\\" '  (p. 7).<br /><br />The humor of this book is in replies like Paul Robinson's:<br /><br />`I am prepared to accept this criticism--and to accept Professor Kivy's distinction between expression and representation--but, perhaps because I am not a philosopher (to put it mildly), I don't feel the weight of the distinction quite so strongly as he does.'  (p. 22).<br /><br />With 8 selections about opera, including the intellectual judgment \\"Strictly as a thinker Wagner was a hopeless third-rater\\" (p. 136), 5 selections in a section on Sex, two appreciations of historian H. Stuart Hughes first published in 1987 and after his death in 1999, thoughts about writing published in the `New Republic' in 1979 and 1980, and the kind of essay that \\"elicited a torrent of angry letters from cat-lovers\\" (p. 308), this book dances around the themes that make music as meaningful as life in the minds of people who prefer one as much as the other.<br /><br />The vocabulary that can express these things gets a workout.  If a psychological designation like schizoid personality disorder could have an intellectual field to play around in, \\"The Opera Queen:  A Voice from the Closet\\"  (pp. 157-169), with its praise of a \\"richly ambivalent view of the closet and the role of concealment\\" (p. 168), might be as fruitful as my own current obsession with rock and roll combining with warfare to produce a rival to civilization in the manner of the essay in this book on cats (pp. 308-312).

The amount of work which went into this book shows.  Writing has become an art that has certain high levels of achievement, and the participation of Anthony Swofford in the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop is one indication that he was striving to be writing at the top level of recognition.  Those who read these books constantly will notice how his innermost thoughts flow in patterns that have occurred before in some of the best.  This book does not have an index, but few people would be looking up the weapons in the index to see what they were good for, anyway.  I am particularly sensitive to issues that ought to be known to civilians, like David Koresh in Waco, Texas before the A.T.F. came to take his fifty-caliber away:<br /><br />`The instructor breaks in.  \\"Hey, gents, can we talk about the rifles?  It's not news that this war is going to be all-American.  I'm here to teach you how to kill people and disable vehicles with your new toy.  By the way, you all know you can't hit a human target with a fifty-caliber weapon, right?  It's in the Geneva Convention.  So you hit the gas can on their vehicle, and they get blown the hell up, but you can't target some lonely guard or a couple of towlies in an OP calling in bombs.  You'll have to get closer with the forty or call in your own bombs.\\" '  (pp. 157-158).<br /><br />I think JARHEAD is the perfect title for this kind of book, because anyone who was there ought to remember how the most likely form of discussion to be directed at someone who isn't thinking exactly as required by the military is like having his head twisted off, if not being treated to the worst kind of disparagement.<br /><br />` . . . \\"That's like shooting a nun or a doctor.  Where'd we find this retard?\\"<br /><br />  The recon sergeant says, \\" . . . They came from the same mama somewhere in the woods of . . .  A big old green, wart-covered jarhead-mama.\\" '  (p. 158).<br /><br />There are many flashbacks for years before and since the marines were sent to Saudi Arabia in 1990, and so many American troops were there that a war was considered likely to settle something.  The intellectual playing field on which politics at the moment might seem more compelling than anything in this book is merely a conventional inversion of the kind of gutter politics that relates to the mentality demonstrated in books of this nature much more closely than the countless citizens of the world who observe military activities without taking part want to understand.  I like this book for my own reasons, largely due to the perversity of things which I do not allow myself to say, though partly as a reminder that the world might easily seem this stupid to anyone subjected to this kind of contact with it.  `open my ruck.'  (p. 1)./>There are many flashbacks for years before and since the marines were sent to Saudi Arabia in 1990, and so many American troops were there that a war was considered likely to settle something.

This book was written a year ago, but there has been so little change in what Bush stands for in the last year that the message seems to be substantiated by every insurrectionary incident in the interim.  The author has a point of view that should be familiar to anyone who has been paying attention to peace movements since World War Two and atomic diplomacy burst upon the scene in the 20th century.  History is much older than the people who are now alive, and Tariq Ali seems to be dropping way back to 1823 to quote a letter by Heinrich Heine about `the hard times that are sure to come.'  (p. 18).  Some great poets have been concerned about their rulers, and the primary case is Osip Mandelstam, whose poem about Stalin before World War Two has still not been forgotten.  The third footnote in this book relates how Stalin called the poet Boris Pasternak on the phone to ask about Osip, and suggests that Pasternak only survived because long before \\"he had praised one of the Georgian poets -- Joseph Djugashvili (Stalin's real name) -- as showing considerable promise.  Another example, perhaps, of the premonitory power that exists in great poets.\\"  (p. 20, n. 3).<br /><br />That might seem creepy to some readers, and I might seem unfair in using the word *creepy* mainly in my reviews of some works of Andy Warhol, but this book has a lot more quirks that might by described as such.  If you try to look up *Mandelstam* in the index, under Makiya, Kanaan it just has \\"Osip 20\\" as if this book already knew which great poet should appear before Marcos, Ferdinand.  Trying to read the entry for \\"Bush, George Sr. 135-7\\" is not all about the book, A WORLD TRANSFORMED by George Bush and Brent Scowcroft.  The book is only in footnote 79 found at the bottom of pages 135 and 137, while page 136 has a picture at the top and 14 lines from Tony Harrison's poem:<br /><br />I saw the charred Iraqi lean<br /><br />towards me from bomb-blasted screen,<br /><br />his windscreen wiper like a pen<br /><br />ready to write down thoughts for men,<br /><br />his windscreen wiper like a quill<br /><br />he's reaching for to make his will.<br /><br />This poem was printed in the `Guardian' and was posted on the internet when I checked this afternoon, and it is considerably longer than what is posted here or printed in this book.  Though footnote 79 is about the first President Bush's book, Tariq Ali suggested reading that as an `account of how old friendships and clan loyalties determine top appointments in the United States, confirming Hanna Batatu's remark that the Syrian Ba'athists would not be out of place in US politics.'  Footnote 80 on the same page about Blair `meeting with four senior journalists from the Guardian after the 2003 war' might be considered worse than creepy if you can figure out what it means.<br /><br />I always find things that I can't say more exciting than whatever you might have expected to hear in church, so looking at the cities on the maps in Iraq inside the front cover, and also in Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan inside the back cover, I noticed that none of them was called a holy city on these maps.  I see articles from several newspapers on the internet, and would not want to blame any particular paper, but it seems to me I just read some account of someone \\"in the holy city of Karbala.\\"  On the map in this book, Karbala and Hillah are closer to Babylon than Ramadi, Fallujah, Baghdad, Najah, or Tikrit, but I was at a loss on how any American paper knows a holy city from any other place that far from home.  I did not expect to find any mention of holy cities in early accounts of the war, as this is something which I only started to worry about recently, but I did find some evidence that this author might have a clue or two about that.  At the beginning of Chapter 3, An Oligarchy of Racketeers, holy cities are first mentioned in an account of the domination of the Arab world by the Ottoman empire.<br /><br />` . . . the victory of the Turkish artillery and muskets over the badly equipped and poorly led army of the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt, following which the holy cities of Mecca and Medina became part of the Empire . . .  The preachers were the first to change sides and record their loyalty to the new order.  The week after the city fell, the Friday prayers in all of Cairo's mosques began thus:<br /><br />\\"O Lord!  Uphold the Sultan, son of the sultan, ruler over both lands and the two seas, conqueror of both hosts, monarch of the two Iraqs, minister of the two Holy Cities, the victorious Sultan Selim Shah. . . .\\" '  (p. 43).<br /><br />The only listing for jackals in the Index is for a poem, `the jackals' wedding' 34-36, which establishes what the author means when he uses the term throughout the book.  In case you aren't clear on that, the picture on page 37 has the caption:<br /><br />`The jackals' wedding:  members of Iraq's so-called Governing Council, central Baghdad, 13 July 2003.'<br /><br />I definitely agree with what this book says about sanctions, even if it might overstate `a water purification crisis and increase the country's death rate.  This was openly discussed within the Clinton administration and approved.'  (p. 140).  Water in Sadr City is probably worse now than what is described in this book.ly, but I did find some evidence that this author might have a clue or two about that.

Amazon.com has both varieties of books, and it would be unfair for me to review one book when I really think you should buy the other (bargain) variety.  There should not be much confusion between two 304 page books with the title WILLIAM BLAKE when the books are actually the same, but the contents are of such variety, listing Peter Ackroyd, Marilyn Butler, Robin Hamlyn, and Michael Phillips as authors of the exhibition guide for the exhibition at Tate Britain, London, 9 November 2000 - 11 February 2001, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 29 March - 24 June 2001, so it might be possible for someone who was looking to see if the listing in two places was identical to discover differences in the information given, though I believe both books are published in 2001 by Harry N. Abrams, Incorporated, New York (Printed and bound in Great Britain).<br /><br />If you just want pictures, some of which seem quite large, this book has 250 illustrations, including 240 plates in full color.  If you like descriptions of pictures, you might find yourself jumping around in the book.  A large picture on page 10 is labeled:  `Opposite:  `Newton' 1795/c. 1805 (no. 249, detail) on page 11.  After the Index on pages 296-298 is a Checklist of Works Exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on pages 299-304 provide a variety of numbers, including a catalogue number in brackets as follows:<br /><br />129 [249] Newton 1795/c. 1805  Color print finished in pen and ink and watercolor 46 x 60 (18 1/8 x 23 5/8) on paper approx. 54.5 x 76 (21 1/2 x 30)  Tate; presented by W. Graham Robertson 1939<br /><br />The full picture is shown on page 213 with a tiny number 249 in the corner by the top margin and a description on page 212 that includes more information than above about \\"Signed `1795 WB inv [in monogram]' and the inscription.  It is possible that the detail page 10 is about full size, showing the lower 30 cm. of a picture that is 46 cm. tall.  Catalogue number 248, Sketch for Newton c. 1795 described on page 212 as being on a paper slightly smaller than standard typing paper, might not appear in this book at all.  Turning back the page from 212 to pages 210-211 reveals a gigantic crawling Nebuchadnezzar 1795/c. 1805 (no. 247, detail) which is a 30 x 46 cm. (almost 12 inch by 18 inch) enlargement of less than half of a picture that was even larger 44.6 x 62 (17 5/8 x 24 3/8) originally.

US	44184384	R1W1N6WKV7QJOA	0671727583	67221443	Smart Women	Books	5	0	6	N	N	Take me back	I was a member of the book of the month club once, which was responsible for me owning some notable hardcover books, and I doubt if anyone actually read any of them more than the number of people who read my copy of SMART WOMEN by Judy Blume.  I thought of it today because I was trying to think of a euphemism for the one word I never say in a review, which comes down to a simple summary of the plot of this book, if you are familiar with the Loving Spoonful song `Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?' as it relates to the problem of one guy choosing between two women, only the song was about sisters and the plot in this novel is mother-daughter romantic disaster.  This book clings to the mind, even while you are reading it, because it attempts to examine the kind of problems that just get worse when you are growing old and can't go back and be absolutely devastating like the famous old philosophers expected their students to be eventually.  Students?  I can't believe I actually said that.  If this book is about learning something, most reviewers seem like the kind of people who don't want to know.	2004-08-29
US	44184384	R1IRFW48O16L36	0743464788	453769013	Pendulum: Leon Foucault and the Triumph of Science	Books	5	1	6	N	N	This book is easier to follow than my explanation	I do not doubt that the world is round, that it turns once a day, and a pendulum at the North or South Pole which was free to continue its motion back and forth in the same plane would seem to return to its original orientation after twenty-four hours.  The strange thing is that in Paris, at latitude 48 degrees, 51 minutes North, the down direction of the pendulum does not line up with the axis of the Earth's rotation, so *it*turns*out*that* it would take considerably longer, about 31 hours and 52 minutes, to get back to the original swing direction, according to PENDULUM LEON FOUCAULT AND THE TRIUMPH OF SCIENCE by Amir D. Aczel.  The two mathematical proofs shown in the Appendix, Proofs of Foucault's Sine Law on pages 241-245, show first the vector additions that break down components of a rotation vector into the horizontal and vertical directions from the point of view of the axis of the Earth's rotation, which would expect the pendulum to go swinging off into space if the Earth did not keep attracting it off course as the world turns.  The second proof has more mathematics and assumes the change depends on the idea that the north part of Paris is rotating slower than the south part, which must travel farther to complete its rotation each day, but we know this rotation, which is called omega, and the proof ends with \\"because omega = 2(pi)/24 hours, since the Earth rotates a full circle in twenty-four hours.\\"  The diagram on page 244 shows an angle theta (latitude) which lines up perfectly with the string holding the pendulum, for a pendulum swinging north and south, but though the north side of a circle under the pendulum will always be on the north side of Paris viewers, as the pendulum sees the Earth spinning the circle is twisting around below it while the point from which it is suspended keeps pulling it back over the center of the circle.<br /><br />In this space age, it is easier to imagine the pendulum hanging from an ultralight satellite in orbit high enough to maintain a position above a point on the Earth's equator.  For symmetry, I would prefer a pole long enough to have a pendulum at each end, one of which is at 30 degrees North Latitude, and the other at 30 degrees South Latitude.  The pendulums would have to be long enough so the weights that swing are not in orbit but are trying to fall to Earth.  Like a circus clown on a bicycle on a high wire far above three rings, no matter how fast the clown is riding, he does not seem to move when he is looking down, because he stays above the same place, but the moon, sun, and some planets keep changing places, and the weights on the pendulums rarely swing between the same two stars because he sees they are trying to fall toward the point which is at the center of the Earth directly beneath him.  Because the sine of 30 degrees is 0.5, it takes each pendulum 48 hours to line up with the same direction on Earth as the initial swinging direction.  If the clown started out with the sun over his head, the next time the sun is over his head, the motion might look the same, but only if he can't tell which side of the pendulum is which.  When he is totally in the dark, the sideways swinging might remind him that the stars have turned around from where they were when he started, and the only way the direction makes sense is that an accumulation of continuous steps must go through the opposite of any initial position when things have turned that far around.<br /><br />Some experiments have been tried and worked, so we don't need the outer space circus clown to prove any of this, but trying to think along these lines reminded me of the song, \\"Standing On The Moon\\" from the Grateful Dead `Built To Last' CD in 1989 or the wonderful `Downhill From Here' live concert DVD in the `Live In Concert' 3-DVD set.  Far out can mean so many things that might seem unrelated, but it knocked me out that Leon Foucault also was able to measure the speed of light in air and water by using a mirror that was spinning at high speed.  The key to getting the right answer is in being able to know precisely how fast the mirror is spinning, but I did not understand the deflection of the light beam he was trying to measure.<br /><br />It does not take long to read this book, but the problems which it covers are intriguing.hat was spinning at high speed.

US	44184384	R3D9MNFU2VJ1NB	0521406102	641876275	Nietzsche: 'On the Genealogy of Morality' (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)	Books	5	9	20	N	N	Nietzsche's most sustained philosophical discussion	This translation of Nietzsche's ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALITY by Carol Diethe, edited by Keith Ansell-Pearson for Cambridge texts in the History of Political Thought, includes some supplementary material, as is now customary for English translations of this book published by Nietzsche in 1887.  Section 4 of Nietzsche's Preface calls attention to ten sections in his other books.  Walter Kaufmann's translation has an Appendix of Seventy-five Aphorisms from Five Volumes, 28 of which are three lines or less long, showing Walter Kaufmann's preference for discreet little thoughts.  Not all ten sections mentioned by Nietzsche were included in Kaufmann's Appendix, but a footnote in this book promises to include \\"All the passages Nietzsche mentioned\\"  (p. 6, n. 7).  Twenty-nine sections are included in the supplementary material in this book, none of which are less than ten lines long, showing more of an appreciation for sustained thought.  Titles of these sections are not given in Nietzsche's preface, except for HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN volume II, section 89, which is called `Morality of Custom' on page 6, `Custom and its sacrifices' on page 135, and `Mores and their victim' in the Mixed Opinions and Maxims (1879) section 89 of Kaufmann's Appendix.<br /><br />I believe ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALITY is Nietzsche's most philosophically sophisticated work, and found that my knowledge of Latin was helpful in reading Walter Kaufmann's translation of the long Tertullian (circa 197 A.D.) quote in section 15 of the first essay, because Nietzsche's comments, such as \\"in better voice, yet worse screamers\\" were located in parentheses within the Latin text, while the English translation in the footnote contained additional information in brackets, such as `[Quaestuaria means prostitute, not carpenter:  see Nietzsche's parenthesis above.]'  This book also has Nietzsche's comments in parentheses in the Latin text, \\"(in better voice, screaming even louder)\\" (p. 33), but the brackets in the footnote also contain Nietzsche's comments \\"[i.e. screaming even louder] in their own tragedy\\" (p. 34, n. 42) so it is much easier to follow reading only the English, which tries to encompass every possible translation with its \\"`This is he', I will say, `that son of a carpenter or prostitute . . .'\\" (p. 34, n. 42).  I am leaving out a few insults after Nietzsche refers to `this well-known description of the mother of Jesus from the Talmud' (p. 34, n. 42), but they are just before Nietzsche adds some Latin of his own, \\"(Per fidem:  that is what is written.)\\"  (p. 33).<br /><br />This translation adds a footnote at this point quoting Tacitus at ANNALS XV. 44, which suggests why the supplementary material includes sections 195-203 of BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.  Kaufmann's translation mentioned section 200 in a footnote at this point, but it is interesting that section 195 started with \\"The Jews -- a people `born for slavery', as Tacitus and the whole ancient world says,\\" (p. 155 and n.1:  Tacitus, HISTORIES V. 8.).  Kaufmann's Appendix did not include BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, but he certainly assumed that readers would have access to an English translation of that work, having done one himself.<br /><br />My interest in ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALITY is mainly in combining Nietzsche's ideas about will to truth, listed in the index for pages xix-xx, 119-20, 126-7, 169, which includes the idea that will to truth is not so much a remnant of the ascetic ideal `as its kernel' (p. 126) with comedy, listed in the index for 9, 81.  Nietzsche links \\"the Dionysian drama of the `fate of the soul'\\" with \\"the grand old eternal writer of the comedy of our existence!\\"  (p. 9), leading up to \\"you almost need to be a cow for this one thing and certainly not a `modern man':  it is rumination\\" (p. 10).  Nietzsche seems less interested in comedy itself than in philosophers.  \\"A married philosopher belongs to comedy, that is my proposition:  and the exception, Socrates, the mischievous Socrates, . . .Every philosopher would say what Buddha said when he was told of the birth of a son:  `Rahula is born to me, a fetter is forged for me' (Rahula means here `a little demon'); . . `freedom is leaving the house':  so thinking, he left the house.\\"  (p. 81).  Nietzsche goes into Latin again to say `Let the world perish, but let philosophy exist, let the philosopher exist, let me exist' (p. 82, n. 76).  Thoughts about throwing `the human soul out of joint' (p. 110) hardly seem like the way to comedy or even music, but \\"The main contrivance which the ascetic priest allowed himself to use in order to make the human soul resound with every kind of heart-rending and ecstatic music was -- as everyone knows -- his utilization of the feeling of guilt.\\"  (p. 110).  The order of Assassins can be found in the Index of Names for the discussion on page 118, with its \\"inkling of that symbol and watchword which was reserved for the highest ranks alone as their secretum:  `nothing is true, everything is permitted' \\"  that challenges the belief in truth.<br /><br />Nietzsche mentioned THE WILL TO POWER as `a work I am writing' at the beginning of section 27 for serious consideration of the History of European Nihilism, but wanted to draw this book to a conclusion \\"that the ascetic ideal has, for the present, even in the most spiritual sphere, only one type of real enemy and injurer:  these are the comedians of this ideal -- because they arouse mistrust.\\"  (pp. 125-6).  This leads right into the will to truth being the kernel of the ascetic ideal, as mentioned above.<br /><br />The early Prefaces for `The Greek State' and `Homer on Competition' found on pages 176-194 are interesting for comparing the noble ideals of antiquity with the possibility `that we will be destroyed because we fail to keep slaves'  (p. 180).  Concluding with `it then only takes a panicky fright to make it fall and smash it. . . . they betray the Hellenic . . .\\"  (p. 194).Every philosopher would say what Buddha said when he was told of the birth of a son:  `Rahula is born to me, a fetter is forged for me' (Rahula means here `a little demon'); . . `freedom is leaving the house':  so thinking, he left the house.\\"  (p. 81).

Magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of Nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in Nam itself as a primary consideration.  Portions of this book originally appeared in `The New Yorker,' so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared.  Frances FitzGerald's original trip to Vietnam was in February to November of 1966, and resulted in articles for the `Atlantic Monthly,' the `Village Voice,' `Vogue,' etc.  People who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like Nam, where large numbers of young Americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion.<br /><br />This book is not perfect.  The only listing for `Tonkin Gulf Resolution' in the index is for the page on which President Johnson's use of the Resolution is questioned by Senator Fulbright in 1966.  That was the time this book is mainly concerned with, but it gives an enormous amount of background information.  It is possible to find a listing in the index under ` GVN' for `and U.S. entry into the war, 354' which gives the page that reflects Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara's testimony to Congress that:<br /><br />\\"It was in response to an amphibious sabotage raid by GVN forces that North Vietnamese PT boats attacked the U.S. destroyer Maddox, mistaking it for one of the South Vietnamese vessels.\\"  (pp. 352-353).<br /><br />Actually, the OPLAN 34A attacks along the Gulf of Tonkin coastline were operations planned and approved in Washington, D.C., and McNamara lied about South Vietnamese operations to maintain the secret status of U.S. operations, during which the North Vietnamese PT boats were responding to recoilless rifle fire from a small boat when American intelligence informed the Maddox that it was about to be attacked.  Radio intercepts of North Vietnamese naval messages on August 4, 1964, were used to convince LBJ and Senators that an attack had occurred when two American destroyers were picking up radar ghosts and sonar readings off the reflection of a hard-turned rudder, as shown by subsequent tests.  Edwin E. Moise's book, TONKIN GULF AND THE ESCALATION OF THE VIETNAM WAR has much more information about that secret circus stunt.<br /><br />Jeffrey Kimball's recent book, THE VIETNAM WAR FILES:  UNCOVERING THE SECRET HISTORY OF NIXON-ERA STRATEGY, contains a reference to the author of this book in a Memorandum by Dwight Chapin to Haldeman, January 18, 1973, about a month after heavy bombing near or in Hanoi to get some ceasefire agreement signed, hoping it could be called `The Peace Announcement' (p. 288) and attempting to describe a point of view different from what intellectuals were expecting.<br /><br />\\"The FitzGeralds and the Fondas, the Halberstams and Harrimans, the Clarks and Ellsbergs and Baezes are poised in the wings just waiting to treat the end of the war as their victory and to so opine from coast to coast.\\"  (Kimball, p. 291).<br /><br />I have the First Vintage Books Edition, August 1973, which was after Dwight Chapin's Memorandum, but I am not sure if American bombing in Cambodia had ended when the actual paper in this book was printed on.  There are only six lines of listings in the index for Cambodia, mostly on general issues, but the week I spent there was hardly earth-shaking.  Of more interest to me was the report in FIRE IN THE LAKE about the An Lao valley, where the battalion 1/12th Infantry from the 4th Infantry Division spent the months from September, 1969 to January, 1970.  I believe this was our first free fire zone, with a base high above a village that had been destroyed, surrounded by paddies in which elephant grass was growing instead of rice, but enemy soldiers were found harvesting highland rice on the hillsides.  Enemy contact was the only kind we had, after all other possibilities had been eliminated in the manner described in this book.<br /><br />\\"In Operation Masher/White Wing alone--a multi-regimental sweep through the north of Binh Dinh province--the Allied forces, by the estimates, destroyed an entire enemy division.  In the process they left hundreds of civilians dead and wounded and `generated' so many refugees as almost to depopulate the fertile An Loa valley.\\"  (p. 405).<br /><br />\\"While the American troops opened roads and `cleared' great stretches of territory, the Front guerrillas came back into every area except those heavily garrisoned by U.S. troops.  By the end of 1966 the NLF continued to govern the An Lao valley as well as the suburbs of Da Nang, Hue, Nha Trang, and Saigon.\\"  (p. 406).<br /><br />There is only one line in the index for Frantz Fanon, but anyone who is interested in how FitzGerald saw a link between revolution against colonial powers in African and Arab countries and the situation in Nam, \\"including the belief in Fate and the symbolic killing of self, which he called `the behavior patterns of avoidance. . . . the sudden crime waves that spread through the cities, the tribal warfare, and the fierce, irrational feuding of the native sects.  As he explained them, . . .\\"  (p.509).

US	44184384	R25POAT5HQ052U	0700612831	531280850	The Vietnam War Files: Uncovering the Secret History of Nixon-Era Strategy (Modern War Studies)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Nam policy history	At less than 370 pages, THE VIETNAM WAR FILES / UNCOVERING THE SECRET HISTORY OF NIXON-ERA STRATEGY by Jeffrey Kimball is a small book, compared to the size of the ax which it is attempting to grind on how poorly American policy works in those areas of the world where a quick victory is not in the cards.  The longer version of the story, told in NIXON'S VIETNAM WAR (1998) by Jeffrey Kimball attempted to cover the years 1953 to 1973.  The events of those years were rather awesome in leading up to the final situation, which is covered in depth in this book, described in the Prologue as carrying the analysis onward \\"from 1969 to 1975\\" (p. 3) to show how events conformed to expectations in the way Robert McNamara had expected the odds to be about even already in December, 1965, when considering how the war was going to present even tougher choices down the road.<br /><br />Those who were most interested in how awful Vietnam turned out as a big step on the road to American hyperpower status will not be surprised that Kimball's epilogue to this book begins with insights on `historical myth' and `mythical tale' from those times before declaring that Nixon's and Kissinger's memoirs \\"were self-serving, incomplete, and obfuscatory, and they took legal and administrative steps that delayed the release of relevant documentary evidence about their policies, strategies, and motives.\\"  (p. 297).  There was no good reason to tell Americans that power could make us more hyper than we already had been, but Kimball is good at finding the secrets which show how hyper the drive for American power has become.<br /><br />I like books which make secret policies a major quest in the historical area, and this one laments the fact that not much has been found yet about Cambodia.  History is such a dynamic pursuit, with odd quirks popping out from weird angles, that I doubt any adequate explanation of that bit of secret policy will ever be forthcoming.  People who thought that Americans needed to fight in Nam so San Francisco would be safe see that argument fail when it is applied to Cambodia, South Vietnam's only neighbor south of Laos, where a peaceful situation prior to 1970 rapidly turned into a victory for enemies of civilization in any form advanced enough to unleash a massive bombing campaign, as a demonstration of hyperpower capabilities when bombs were dropping like the cards in a game of 52 pick up.<br /><br />This book is most game-like in its use of card terminology for the Nixon strategy, which even carries over to \\"Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders had coincidentally decided that it was time to rejoin the world of nations, play the American card against the Soviet Union, and, especially, use the opportunity to get U.S. forces out of Taiwan.\\"  (p. 299).  That might seem like a bit much for the Chinese to hope for, but a tape on Nam reveals Nixon saying, \\"Oh, I don't mean to tell, tell Thieu we're getting out in the fall.  But it's moot, because we are without question gonna get out . . .\\"  (p. 168).  That was from Oval Office Conversation no. 527-16, Nixon, Haldeman, Kissinger, and John Ehrlichman, 9:14-10:12 a.m., June 23, 1971, in which Kissinger said, \\"Now, our cards, starting now, our cards are going to start falling.\\"  (p. 167).  Three weeks before, a press conference brought up antiwar sentiment `that American intervention was immoral' (p. 160) and a tape of the following morning, June 2, 1971, reveals that Nixon was \\"very agitated during the conversation.  Pounding his desk at one point, he vowed, . . .  He would use his `card' of massive bombing.\\"  (p. 161).  Since American troops were there, \\"it is certainly immoral to send Americans abroad and not back them up with American power!\\"  (p. 162).  Nixon might be a bit unclear about what actually happened after the French left North Vietnam, but he was worried about allowing \\"the bloodbath in South Vietnam that they had in North Vietnam where 50,000 of our good Catholic [unclear] ofDanang [a city shown on the map facing page 1 along the coast southeast of Quang Tri and Hue in South Vietnam] were murdered, 500,000 were starved to death in slave-labor camps [pounding his desk].\\"  (p. 162).

Kallir D. 344) shows mainly a face and hand appearing on the left side of page 62 far above striped trousers in `Man with headband and Hand on Cheek (Self-Portrait) 1909.'  A tiny patch of blue marks the edge of the sleeve just below the hand, and another tiny patch of blue is at the end of the outline of the other sleeve, just in front of the trousers, but the lines between the patches are faint, don't intersect, and imply that his stomach was flat as a board.<br /><br />Some interesting paper that is slightly more yellow and larger isn't big enough to show the top of his hair, his left hand, or anything below his hips in `Self-Portrait with Arm Twisting Above Head 1910' on pages 4 and 111.  One of my favorite Egon Schiele paintings, `Self-Portrait with Hand to Cheek 1910' is shown on page 115.  He is pulling his cheek down so hard on one side that his other ear sticks out.  Another favorite is `Schiele, Drawing a Nude Model Before a Mirror 1910' on page 135 which clearly shows the model's eyes watching herself in the mirror, while the artist's eyes, looking at himself, are so dark it seems like he can see you.  For a drawing done with a pencil, it establishes a perspective that shows great depth, even if one of the model's arms is missing where it approaches the edge of the paper or failed to line up with the rest of the picture.<br /><br />The picture on the cover is similar to many in the book; a few extra lines and colors don't stay within the outline.  `The Artist's Sister-in-Law in Striped Dress, Seated 1917' on page 402 shows stripes over her shoulders and running out from her hips, but the area around her hands is mainly blank.  The color of the paper works well for her chin and neck, and the darker paper on page 403, on which she is `Covering Mouth with Hands 1917' is a nice comparison, in which Schiele had a different angle to attempt to capture the chaos in her hair.<br /><br />The author of this book knows a lot about the art and life of Egon Schiele and the artists that he associated with.  The chronological order of the pictures does emphasize the sequence, but almost everything falls in the years 1907 to 1918, and his subjects didn't vary much.  `The Truth Unveiled 1913' on page 265 could be called a portrait of the artist contemplating his hands, or you didn't expect me to name this for the woman hiding behind me, did you?  I might like these paintings more than I should because I appreciate certain events in the life of the artist, who was so frail that he did not get sent to basic training and guard duty for the great war until June 27, 1915 (p. 326).  When he had sick leave in Vienna, he painted a portrait of his wife (p. 327).  He changed.  `As documented in his work from 1914-15, the transition between these two worlds had been extraordinarily painful for the artist. . . .  Like all young boys, he had to grow up.'

Books	3	3	3	N	N	Written for other professors	WHAT IS RELIGION ? by Paul Tillich, Translated and with an introduction by James Luther Adams (Harper & Row, 1969) combines three works originally written in German, one of which was published in 1925.  The two works in the final third of the book were presented to meetings of Kant-Gesellschaft in 1919 and 1922, and may now be found mainly in Gesammelte Werke volumes I and IX.  In the introduction by James Luther Adams, he reminds us of `the turbulent years in Germany which followed World War I, a period in which cynicism, despair, radical reconception, revolutionary impulse and heady utopianism vied with each other in appeal for public favor.'  (p. 10).  Tillich's essay, `The Conquest of the Concept of Religion in the Philosophy of Religion' (pp. 122-154) is printed second, but it is called `a necessary prologue to his PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION' (p. 12) in the Introduction.  I tried reading this book in the reverse order because the final selection, `On the Idea of a Theology of Culture' (pp. 155-181) contains an early expression of a topic which I previously associated with Paul Tillich, and it offered the most comparisons with the ideas of Nietzsche, who is listed in the index for pages 52, 123, 158, 171, 172, 173.  Real praise for Nietzsche might be associated with Tillich in his comparison:<br /><br />`Thus Nietzsche, since he acted in the name of the God who spoke through him, had a right to fight against God; Strauss, on the other hand, had no such right, for it was the human, the all too human, that spoke through him.\\"  (p. 123).<br /><br />`The Philosophy of Religion' first appeared in a HANDBOOK OF PHILOSOPHY that was a massive work on academic disciplines.  Tillich was struck by the opposing points of view which make definitions in this area the first problem to be dealt with.<br /><br />`It denies the philosophical conviction of truth as much as it denies the unconditionality of revelation to allow either of them to be forced into one sphere alongside others.  Every attempt of this kind must miscarry.'  (p. 29).<br /><br />As an early attempt to allow himself to define his own philosophy, this essay includes the idea of the Unconditional, (p. 35), an essence of religion, (p. 38), a psychological circle comparing one's own experience with what others experience fails when `the psychological method has given up the supernatural presupposition of the miraculous character of one's own experience, and therefore can freely acknowledge the other religions.'  (p. 39).  Religion's habit `depends on the opposition of true and false religion,' (p. 40), and a science of this habit fails when `It would have to repudiate the concept of religion as an attempt to place the true and the false on the same level.  It would not be at liberty to make the claim to be philosophy of religion, and would have to remain theology, a normative theory of religion.'  (p. 40).<br /><br />Near the end of this book, Nietzsche's philosophy is compared with `Jesus' fight against the Pharisees and Luther's fight against Rome,'  (p. 171).  Rage is associated with the `wish to consume thyself in thine own flame.'  (p. 171).  Tillich hopes for `a theonomous overcoming of the autonomous ethical forms without a relapse into the heteronomy of a specifically religious community of love.'  (p. 172).  Just a page later, `Nor does it help matters if we adorn this autonomous state with all the functions of culture and turn it into God on earth, as does Hegel;'  (p. 173).  The five parts of the final essay are:<br /><br />1.  Theology and Religious Philosophy<br /><br />2.  Culture and Religion<br /><br />3.  Theology of Culture<br /><br />4.  Cultural-Theological Analyses<br /><br />5.  Theology of Culture and the Theology of the Churchs.  Every attempt of this kind must miscarry.'

This book has 173 pages of writings and speeches (he gave an address in Concord when it observed the centenary of the birth of Ralph Waldo Emerson on May 25, 1903) by William James, followed on pages 177-334 by notes, ending with a note that the word dish-|washing was broken at the end of the first line on page 172 in `The Moral Equivalent of War' just as it was in the copy-text.<br /><br /> The James family had a number of famous writers, and some publisher is probably still selling novels and stories that William's brother Henry had not finished when he died, so I had not expected the first essay, `Introduction to The Literary Remains of the Late Henry James' to be about William's father Henry, author of SOCIETY THE REDEEMED FORM OF MAN, supposedly the confessions of Stephen Dewhurst, who is revealed here to be `an entirely fictitious personage.' (p. 3). William recognized the main emphasis of his father as theology and wrote, `Probably few authors have so devoted their entire lives to the monotonous elaboration of one single bundle of truths.' (p. 4). Regarding a huge source for his ideas, William reported, `Many disciples of Swedenborg, wielding high authority, say there is no warrant in the master's pages for Mr. James's views. It is certain, to say the very least, that Mr. James has given to the various elements in Swedenborg's teaching an extremely different accentuation and perspective relation to each other, from anything other readers have been able to find.' (p. 59).<br /><br /> Those who seek irony in divine appreciation of the human situation might like a few lines the older Henry James wrote about Jesus: `I find no trace of any other man who felt himself called upon by the tenderest human love to loathe and disavow the proud and yearning bosom that bore him. I find no other man in history whose profound reverence for infinite goodness and truth drove him to renounce the religion of his fathers, simply because that religion contemplated his own supreme aggrandizement; and whose profound love of man drove him to renounce . . .&quot; (pp. 57-58).<br /><br /> The speech which follows, `Robert Gould Shaw: Oration by Professor William James,' on pages 64-74 describes the attack by the first Northern Negro regiment on Fort Wagner one evening, and his glory to be buried in a trench by the Confederates the next morning.<br /><br /> `Preface to Second Edition' for HUMAN IMMORTALITY follows that, then the original lecture on pages 77-101. Similar topics fill `Preface to Starbuck's PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION' (pp. 102-104), `Preface to Lutoslawski's WORLD OF SOULS' (pp. 105-108), and `Introduction to Fechner's LIFE AFTER DEATH' (pp. 116-119). War is the main topic of `Remarks at the Peace Banquet' (pp. 120-123), which strongly asserted `The plain truth is that people want war.' (p. 122). But William James still praises the country that `knows that between civilized countries a war is a crime against civilization.' (p. 123). Trying to distinguish `Reason and Faith' (pp. 124-128), William James still questions `what is the use of only half-killing your enemy?' (p. 125).<br /><br /> `The Energies of Man' (pp. 129-146) might be read to find the ways in which William James shared the same concerns as new age practices which became popular among baby boomers later in the twentieth century. `From time immemorial, by Hatha Yoga, Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga, or whatever code of practice it might be, Hindu aspirants to perfection have trained themselves, month in and month out, for years.' (pp. 136-137). James had more interest when `some unusual stimulus fills us with emotional excitement' (p. 132), as the letter James read describing the state of mind and body of Colonel Baird Smith during `the six weeks' siege of Delhi in 1857' (p. 134) in which `Colonel Baird Smith, needing to draw on altogether extraordinary stores of energy, found that brandy and opium were ways of throwing them into gear.' (p. 136). More generally, `There is no doubt that to some men sprees and excesses of almost any kind are medicinal, temporarily at any rate, in spite of what the moralists and doctors say.' (p. 136).<br /><br /> `The Powers of Men' (pp. 147-161) managed to repeat what is quoted above about Colonel Baird Smith, `that brandy and opium were ways of throwing them into gear.' (p. 155).<br /><br /> Finally, `The Moral Equivalent of War' (pp. 162-173) set the standard for Harvard professors hopping, skipping, and jumping around on this issue. War is `a sacred spiritual possession worth more than all the blood poured out.' (p. 162). History from the ancient Greeks and Romans to 1898 runs from `The cruelty of those times was incredible&quot; (p. 164) to `The pliant politician McKinley was swept away by their eagerness, and our squalid war with Spain became a necessity.' (p. 164). Calling himself a `pacifist tho' I am,' (p. 165) he still had to admit, `All reflective apologists for war at the present day take it religiously. It is to them a sort of sacrament; . . .' (p. 165). James could imagine, with the help of a recent book, THE VALOR OF IGNORANCE by General Homer Lea, Japan claiming `the entire Pacific Ocean; and to oppose these deep designs we Americans have, according to our author, nothing but our conceit, our ignorance, our commercialism, our corruption, and our feminism.' (p. 167). James thought the argument could be met as a typical controversy in which, once a Harvard professor had managed to move the point, any logical opponent would follow wherever the discussion might lead. Grab onto Tolstoy's pacifism which `makes the fear of the Lord furnish the moral spur provided elsewhere by the fear of the enemy.' (p. 169).

There were a few pictures in the book, and I even have a reunion picture of the cast, Candice Bergen, Art Garfunkel, Jack Nicholson, and Ann-Margret with Mike Nichols taken on January 28, 2001 by Annie Leibovitz to remind me that the sexual competition between guys can turn into a lifelong quest for more excitement if women don't actually control the magical element of who is whose in a way that is more subtle than the plot of this movie.  The men in this movie appear to be successful professional American men, but the wit which is turned on their situation in this movie lacerates life as we know it.  As a book, it offers a script that provides the bare bones for understanding the assumptions behind the assertion of self as a controling motif in sexuality.  The tension between characters has aged well, as society in general seems to have become less able to cope with the people who actually live here and might even have to pay the bills someday.  Watching the movie can be a lot of look, look, look, while the years fly by, but having the book is something you can throw at the wall without doing much damage, if your aim is halfway decent and you don't have anything in the house that you might want to destroy.	2004-07-25

Smith, Ph.D., has a lot of facts right, but it is incredibly stupid to call something a gigantic fraud when everyone knows that it is going on, people are powerless to stop it, and people will vote for politicians who promise to give everyone tax cuts whenever it looks like the government will have some surplus. Smith knows that real surpluses are extremely rare; according to facts listed in the Social Security Chronology on pages xi through xiv, only two years since The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 made it illegal to include Social Security in calculating budget deficits and surpluses had an on-budget surplus. Those years were 1999 and 2000. Accounting trickery is not something that most people comprehend when it is applied to something larger than a lockbox, and the subtitle, How the Government is Draining America's Retirement Account, requires knowledge of quantities that are beyond comprehension, unlikely to be paid in any year in which they are due, because the only amount that is associated with that drain is the gigantic national debt, which had grown to more than 4 trillion dollars by the end of the first time a Bush had been president.<br /><br /> Smith is not fond of tax cuts, which he believes are likely to intentionally create a financial crisis to force benefit cuts that most people would not support. 1999 and 2000 were extraordinary years, at the peak of a business cycle and with the lowest unemployment in 30 years, and the national debt of more than 6 trillion dollars in 2001 was not actually growing, but would never shrink unless real budget surpluses and payroll taxes designated for social security funds could be used to reduce that debt. Some households in 1999 had already received a $40,000-plus average tax cut compared to the percentage of income the richest one percent paid in 1977, when rates were higher but incomes were actually lower, due to an almighty dollar that was losing value in the instability race with interest rates that dooms all comparisons eventually. $40,000 won't seem like much next year, but in 1999 the entire average before-tax income of the middle fifth of households was projected to be $38,700 per household. If most of those people aren't making more than that now, they are probably borrowing more money than ever, as the expansion of credit keeps the economy going, and they will really need more money when interest rates rise. That tax cuts are such a big issue politically tends to show that America is tending toward plutocracy, which you can look up in the dictionary or in the index of this book.<br /><br /> Smith even uses this point of view to explain Iraq. &quot;President Bush talks of bringing democracy to Iraq and other countries. Is he really . . . Or is it plutocracy that he really wants to impose on foreign nations?&quot; (p. 165).<br /><br /> More than a year ago, Peter G. Peterson, President of the Concord Coalition, was complaining about a $10 trillion projected deficit swing, when &quot;right now the long-term deficit outlook is even worse than the 10-year outlook.&quot; (April 30, 2003, p. 167). Paul O'Neill is also mentioned on pages 149-150 in connection with a study that showed future deficits roughly equivalent to 10 times the publicly held national debt, four years of U.S. economic output or more than 94 percent of all U.S. household assets. O'Neill was fired in December 2002, and the study was in a New York Times article on May 29, 2003, so it shouldn't be surprising if more people lose their jobs before the government informs any papers about any crisis of a financial nature.<br /><br /> The Social Security fund is expected to take in more money than it pays out until 2018. Smith thinks it is possible that Congress will then pass huge increases in the debt ceiling to borrow enough money to pay off its debts to Social Security. This would increase the public debt, taking money from the global economy to pay offsomething which is now called a government IOU, so interest rates might be pushed up a bit to compete with other likely borrowers of real money. With the gigantic national debt that will be due then, amounts needed for social security will be enormous. When the IOUs run out in 2042, social security revenue might pay 72 percent of benefits due.<br /><br /> Smith has been a professor of economics and has written newspaper columns. Trying to tell Americans anything gets a good head start when the ideas are simple. &quot;Apparently George W. Bush intends to impose his low-tax, low-service philosophy on all of the American people, whether they want it or not. He is trying to starve the government into turning its back on responsibilities it has held for decades.&quot; (p. 192). Against such an agenda, Smith can only whimper, &quot;And I am one of those extreme radicals who believe that the wealthy should not be able to use their wealth to buy political power.&quot; (p. 193). Plutocracy has to be worse than the current state of the Bush Administration for wealthy people to agree with that one, but a few rock stars might be humble enough to keep from running for office if they ask their fans how many people would want to vote for them. Rock stars aren't even in this book, but Smith is poor enough to admit, &quot;there is no Santa Claus for those of us beyond a certain age. But we so much want to believe in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, and the Easter bunny . . .&quot; (p. 194).something which is now called a government IOU, so interest rates might be pushed up a bit to compete with other likely borrowers of real money.

He is trying to starve the government into turning its back on responsibilities it has held for decades.&quot; (p. 192). Against such an agenda, Smith can only whimper, &quot;And I am one of those extreme radicals who believe that the wealthy should not be able to use their wealth to buy political power.&quot; (p. 193). Plutocracy has to be worse than the current state of the Bush Administration for wealthy people to agree with that one, but a few rock stars might be humble enough to keep from running for office if they ask their fans how many people would want to vote for them. Rock stars aren't even in this book, but Smith is poor enough to admit, &quot;there is no Santa Claus for those of us beyond a certain age. But we so much want to believe in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, and the Easter bunny . . .&quot; (p. 194).	2004-07-25

The author, Nils Johan Ringdal, has written about Germans and the Norwegian police in World War II, but has been collecting information about prostitution for so long that the final 30 pages of the books are references, ending with a page of movies. People who have hoped that condoms might be useful to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases will wonder what the Los Angeles police were thinking in 1990 when Gloria Lockett, now an activist, bought twelve dozen condoms in a drugstore, walked outside, and the police &quot;grabbed her purse and shook it upside down. Then they punctured every single condom, one by one, pushing the knife down into the latex membrane, slowly and with great enjoyment. Gloria got her purse back, along with a pile of useless rubber.&quot; (p. 401). This book does not have an index, but the short &quot;Quotes and References&quot; for each chapter at the end of the book includes the King James English Bible verses used in Chapters 2, Patriarchs and Priestesses, and 7, Repentant Sinners, with a few references from the Qu'ran for Chapter 9, Muhammad's Women. There is no Table of Contents for finding anything at the beginning of the book, but pictures appear between pages 150 and 151, just before Chapter 11, Celestial Whores, and between pages 310 and 311. The page facing 311 shows most of the world for two maps, &quot;The origin and early spread of prostitution 3000 B.C. - 1000 B.C.&quot; and &quot;Migration of Prostitutes 1914&quot; (European women and Japanese women, loosely taken from Ronald Hyam). The second map shows four arrows pointing directly at Shanghai, one of which is from San Francisco, but the arrow in the Pacific Ocean near San Francisco is labeled &quot;To Hong Kong from Shanghai.&quot; Page 311 itself is interesting for the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire by the Young Turks. &quot;When the grand harem of Constantinople closed down in 1909, 370 wives and attendants and 127 eunuchs became homeless. The deposed sultan was allowed to take a few favorites into exile in Salonica. The others were set free.&quot;<br /><br /> This book is highly aware that &quot;Sex and reproduction, happiness and security, have, to an almost absurd degree, become themes of public debate in Europe and the U.S., though the discourse is political and not moral. Hypocrisy and ambiguous argument rule the day.&quot; (p. 3). Trying to find a frame of reference that recognizes any individual's rights is far less clear than opting for personal viewpoints: &quot;Nobody has the right to sex, either unpaid or in exchange for payment: If nobody wants to sell sex, it is a crime to force anyone to do so. But when men or women do want to sell their bodies, they should have that full right without encountering punishment or discrimination. If the client behaves decently, the relationship between the sex buyer and the sex seller must be considered a purely private transaction.&quot; (pp. 3-4). Striving to find limits that satisfy political economy and the ethical interests of people who avoid such activity as a matter of principle make this a tough issue in the field of philosophy, and Chapter 4, Greek Liberalism, begins with the philosopher Socrates drinking hemlock &quot;surrounded by his young male admirers, such as the young Phaedon of Elis, who had just purchased his freedom from a brothel.&quot; (p. 52). Possibly Socrates was not the greatest Greek, since &quot;Solon founded Western democracy.&quot; (p. 54). &quot;But Solon is also the father of the sex industry, and his sexual reforms were closely linked to his other reforms.&quot; (p. 55). &quot;The sex industry quickly became a lucrative supplemental income for Athens and stole an important section of the market from the previously very popular Ephesus in Asia Minor, where a more old-fashioned, temple-related prostitution was still practiced.&quot; (p. 55). The emphasis, &quot;Men dominated Greek urban society,&quot; (p. 55) is in contrast with the earlier period studied by Johann Jacob Bachofen, Lewis Morgan, and the Communist Friedrich Engels. &quot;Bachofen argued that humankind had shifted away from the promiscuous freedom of the horde, through matriarchy, to patriarchy, a form of society that he considered to have developed in Mesopotamia, with Jewish, Egyptian, Roman, Indian, and Chinese variants.&quot; (p. 5). The mixture of cultures is particularly noticeable in the field of prostitution. &quot;Many feel that foreign and racially different prostitutes are tangible symbols of a world that is becoming a moral cesspool.&quot; (p. 385). This kind of history is likely to promote the belief that law itself is an intellectual cesspool when it attempts to deal with such situations by locking people up to stifle economic activity in a world where guys make most of the money, but supporting women and children is a low priority, as Socrates was partly condemned for not spending his time at work making money. The quality of Socrates' questions might be considered a higher intellectual level than the modern economic observation, &quot;As the demand for cheap prostitutes grew and recruitment failed, the vacancies had to be filled with imported foreign labor.&quot; (p. 384). This is now a very large field for the number of people employed, and transportation is one of the conveniences of a global economy. This book reflects all that perfectly.p. 55) is in contrast with the earlier period studied by Johann Jacob Bachofen, Lewis Morgan, and the Communist Friedrich Engels. &quot;Bachofen argued that humankind had shifted away from the promiscuous freedom of the horde, through matriarchy, to patriarchy, a form of society that he considered to have developed in Mesopotamia, with Jewish, Egyptian, Roman, Indian, and Chinese variants.&quot; (p. 5).

The history of ridicule is covered quite thoroughly, going back all the way to the ancient Greek general and poet Archilochus, who is mainly associated with a curse in this book. Will Durant in THE LIFE OF GREECE made the satiric barbs of verse by Archilochus directed at Neobule, her sister, and her rich father, Lycambes, in Paros rather self-fulfilling (if `all three of them, legend assures us, hanged themselves' sounds like they truly did it to themselves) while a military kind of feeling is described in this book as the curse usually associated with &quot;satire's supposed founder, Archilochus, delighting in the exquisite sight of the curse fulfilled upon the enemy,&quot; (p. 29), and then mentioned more than once to illustrate texts which should be much more familiar. &quot;Believing himself, as his friends also assume, cursed by God, Job responds as we might expect the victim of the curse of Archilochus to respond.&quot; (p. 35). An element of magic is added to such considerations, after mentioning that Shemaiah the Nehelamite called Jeremiah &quot;a crazy fellow who takes himself for a prophet,&quot; (p. 138) in the sentence, &quot;Uttered at a time that believed in the efficacy of words, Jeremiah's curse easily matches the fearful imprecations of Archilochus:&quot; (p. 139). A note containing Archilochus' curse also includes the information, &quot;A priest and servant of the War God, Ares, Archilochus obviously fashioned his own appropriate psalms.&quot; (pp. 204-205). It was easy to locate this information because Archilochus is listed in the Index of Authors on page 246, following the Bibliography (pp. 238-245), and before the Index of Subjects (pp. 248-253) and Biblical References (pp. 253-255).<br /><br /> Though written in an obviously scholarly manner, this book seemed ideal for introducing me to a vocabularythat I could apply to my own concerns, as a comic put-on artist parading a string of old cartoons in opposition to modern power and anyone who might think, &quot;Hey, we won the war.&quot; (I swear I read that in some news article dated March, April, or May, 2004, coming from someone in Washington, D.C. trying to exert a little influence on anyone who could change the provisions of a contract for cell phone service for emergency response coordination in Iraq.) The same reasoning might apply to anyone who acts like &quot;Hey, we own the oil&quot; or the world's largest economic system, safest drugs, hedge funds, or even weapons of mass destruction, though that seems less mentionable than special feces now. The tension in trying to determine whether the Bible or modern scholarship provides better terminology for actively engaging in the pursuit of contemporary meanings might be overwhelming for people who are just getting started in this kind of activity, but consider the choices:<br /><br /> scorn, ridicule, tendentious (p. 12), cruel, bitter, &quot;irony, bawdy and ribaldry, taunt and mockery, burlesque and lampoon, parody and denigration&quot; (p. 13), caustic wit and sardonic expression, &quot;black and gallows humour, satire and parody, raging anger and kaleidoscopic irony [thrice compared to that of Jonathan Swift], harangue and taunt, invective and cursing, and the whole panoply of derogatory attitudes displayed in the prophetic books&quot; (p. 13)<br /><br /> could be compared with Isaiah 14:4-21, called Isaiah's satire on the king of Babylon, which in verse 17 asks:<br /><br /> `Who made the world as a wilderness<br /> And destroyed its cities,<br /> Who did not open the house of his prisoners?'<br /><br /> Psychologically, there is some kind of antagonism to alpha male authoritarianism in the prophets who pick on the king of Babylon by listing people locked up. We hardly know who they were, or if their usual abode was searched for weapons like modern detainees, some of whom are still likely to remain nameless under the detention rules adopted as a result of 9-11, which seemed to be more of a destruction of the city in New York than at the Pentagon, where one side of a single building easily absorbed the crash of a passenger airplane without causing the kind of intelligence catastrophe that would have been the result of a crash at the CIA headquarters. The king of Babylon might seem to be a better symbol for alpha male authoritarian behavior than anyone in American society, which functions mainly as a bunch of clerks humbly doing their jobs and hoping for big breaks that have little in common with the sadistic wit pictured by Martin Grotjahn:<br /><br /> &quot;Under the guise of brilliance, charm, and entertainment the wit . . . is a sadist at heart. He is sharp, quick, alert, cold, aggressive, and hostile. He is inclined to murder his victims in thought; if he inhibits himself and if he does not succeed in transforming his brain child into a joke, he may develop a migraine attack instead.&quot; (p. 14).<br /><br /> But the forms of wit striving to achieve some form of recognition in American society and globally conform mainly to the entertainment values which determine commercial success. This book attempting to provide a scholarly look at Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, and Amos with an awareness of such scornful derision with which &quot;the very conventions of the social order are exposed as bootless&quot; (p. 108) also notes targets of satire that point &quot;to the disastrous consequences of these customary devices of safety and security.&quot; (p. 108).<br /><br /> People who are only familiar with portions of the Bible that are regularly read as scripture in public worship services might need to do a considerable amount of reading of parts of the Bible that they have not heard before to appreciate how truly this book reflects its sources. For anyone who reflects intellectually on the nature of wit, that should not be an overwhelming challenge.	2004-07-15

What was going on in the core of Unit No. 4 in the midst of a sudden surge in the energy level ultimately assumed the significance of a question raised by Arnold J. Toynbee in the first paragraph of Part V.  The Disintegration of Civilizations of his A STUDY OF HISTORY (Abridgement by D. C. Somervell, Oxford University Press, 1946), &quot;Is disintegration a new problem on its own account or can we take it for granted as a natural and inevitable sequel to breakdown?&quot;  (Chapter XVII.  The Nature of Disintegration, p. 360).  The assumption of those who were operating nuclear power plants was that conditions would never exceed a point at which the core became too hot for whatever cooling system was in contact with the reactor core to continue to function.<br />There is an interesting paragraph in THE TRUTH ABOUT CHERNOBYL by Grigori Medvedev, Translated from the Russian by Evelyn Rossiter (Basic Books, Inc. 1991) which describes the problems in the cooling system when pressing the AZ button to shut down the reactor caused a power surge:<br />&quot;The increase in reactor power had the following effects:  the hydraulic resistance of the core sharply increased; the water flow fell even farther; intensive steam formation occurred; there was film boiling*; the nuclear fuel assemblies were destroyed; the coolant, which by now contained destroyed fuel particles, came violently to the boil; and pressure rose abruptly in the fuel channels, which began to fall apart.&quot;  (p. 76, which also includes a note):<br />`*  &quot;Film boiling&quot; is a most undesirable condition which occurs when bubbles at the surface of the boiling water in the fuel channels are replaced by a film that prevents the heat of the core from being transferred to the water.  A safety margin is required at all times.--Trans.'<br />That does not sound as hot as a temperature or level of radiation which would cause the water molecules to breakdown to hydrogen and oxygen elements that would rise from the heat only to recombine in a cooler fire at a higher level, but the physical destruction caused by explosions made the attempt to feed more water to the core by opening valves worse than useless.  &quot;Akimov was convinced that the water from the functioning feedwater pump was traveling along these pipes and into the reactor; whereas in actual fact it was going nowhere near the reactor, but merely pouring into the lower compartments, flooding the cable housings and switching gear underground, and making an already bad situation worse.&quot;  (Testimony of Viktor Grigoryevich Smagin, shift foreman in No. 4 unit, p. 133).<br />Grigori Medvedev is a Soviet nuclear engineer.  In the Author's Preface to the American Edition, he admits the failures of nuclear bureaucrats who attempted to describe nuclear power as safe.  &quot;It now seems hardly surprising that Chernobyl marked the final, spectacular collapse of a declining era.&quot;  (p. ix).  It took a year to gather the information in this book, and knowing all that, to attempt &quot;a picture of the full horror of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, to revive the dead and the maimed, and have them return to the control room to relive those tragic hours.&quot;  (p. x).<br />The problem at Three Mile Island is discussed in the first chapter.  As temperature and pressure rose in that overheating reactor, &quot;Through the pilot-operated relief valve on the pressurizer, a mixture of super-heated water and steam began to be discharged into a special tank.  However, once the water pressure in the primary loop had dropped to the normal level of 2,275 psi (160 kg/cm-squared), the valve failed in the open position,causing pressure in the tank also to rise above the normal limit.  The emergency membrane on the tank disintegrated, sending about 97,700 gallons (370 meters-cubed) of hot radioactive water onto the floor of the containment building (into the central chamber).&quot;  (p. 12).<br />&quot;In the opinion of experts, shortly before the emergency core cooling system was switched on, or perhaps soon afterward, at least 20,000 fuel rods out of a total of 36,000 (177 fuel assemblies each containing 208 rods) were left without coolant.  The protective zirconium cladding around the fuel rods began to crack and fall apart.  Highly radioactive fission products started to leak from the damaged fuel rods.  The water in the primary loop became even more radioactive.&quot;  (p. 13)<br />The temperature in the reactor was higher than 752 degrees Fahrenheit (400 degrees C) so the computer recording the &quot;temperature in the core began to display only question marks and continued to do so for the next 11 hours.&quot;  (pp. 13-14).  Pages 16-19 list nuclear &quot;Precursors of the Disaster&quot; from 1951 to 1986 in the United States and from the September 1957 spontaneous nuclear reaction in spent fuel at the reactor near Chelyabinsk (&quot;livestock was destroyed and buried in pits&quot; p. 18) to a steam release on June 27, 1985 which killed fourteen people in No. 1 reactor of the Balakovo nuclear power station in the Soviet Union.

C. Somervell of Arnold Toynbee's multi-volume set into two small volumes is too selective to encompass the whole picture.  People with strong political opinions might even agree with Walter Kaufmann, at the end of his book, FROM SHAKESPEARE TO EXISTENTIALISM, that Arnold J. Toynbee's attempt to write A STUDY OF HISTORY in ten volumes, which provides abundant lessons which leaders of today ought to heed to avoid the ignominious fate of numerous nations, peoples, and civilizations who are far less prosperous than Americans today, if certain outstanding obligations are not considered and everything which must be reported as income for tax purposes is assumed to benefit someone, actually amounts to a form of argument in which, \\"His method is what Stephen Potter calls `one-upmanship.'  Where a red herring might be recognized and challenged, the queer fish that Toynbee introduces with an air of mildly bored authority silence all opposition--unless you either happen to know about them or have the patience to find out.\\"  (Kaufmann, FSTE, Chapter 20, `Toynbee and Religion,' p. 413).<br />The Table of Contents has parts and chapters both consecutively numbered with Roman Numerals, so Part V.  The Disintegration of Civilizations, includes Chapter XIX.  Schism in the Soul.  Subdivisions such as (3) Truancy and Martyrdom show such mixtures of cowardice and courage that even Toynbee gets caught considering subjective natures in the worst possible light:<br />`~`The truant soul of which we are in search is a soul whose truancy is inspired by a genuine feeling that the cause which it serves is not really worth the service that this cause demands of it.  Similarly the martyr soul of which we are in search is the soul which goes to martyrdom not merely or mainly to render practical service to the furtherance of that cause but rather to satisfy a craving of the soul itself for deliverance from<br />the heavy and the weary weight<br />Of all this unintelligible world.  [W. Wordsworth, `Tintern Abbey]<br />Such a martyr, noble as he may be, is psychologically more than half a suicide.  He is, in modern jargon, an escapist, as is also of course our truant an escapist of a more ignoble variety.'~'  (Toynbee, A STUDY OF HISTORY  Abr. Vol. I, p. 442).<br />Continuing on the same page, the disintegration of civilizations was not a pretty picture, even in ancient times:<br />`~`The Christian Church was the principal target for the parting strokes of a Hellenic dominant minority which turned savage in its death-agony; for this dying pagan ruling class refused to face the heart-rending truth that it was itself the author of its own downfall and destruction.  Even in articulo mortis it tried to salvage a last shred of self-respect by persuading itself that it was perishing as the victim of a dastardly assault on the part of the proletariat; and, since the external proletariat was now marshalled in formidable war-bands which were able to defy or elude the Imperial Government's attempts at retaliation for their galling raids, the brunt fell upon the Christian Church, which was the master institution of the internal proletariat.'~'<br />Toynbee is able to appreciate the martyrs of the early Christian Church.  \\"Ignatius of Antioch, one of the notable Christian martyrs of the second century, speaks of himself as `the wheat of God' and longs for the day when he shall be `ground by the teeth of wild beasts into the pure bread of Christ'.\\"  (Vol. I, p. 443).<br />There is much more to Toynbee than theology, but it was a very religious time when Volume I of the Abridged A STUDY OF HISTORY was published in 1947 and became an international best-seller.  The second abridged volume appeared much later.ch more to Toynbee than theology, but it was a very religious time when Volume I of the Abridged A STUDY OF HISTORY was published in 1947 and became an international best-seller.

In the case of Three Mile Island, what happened might be described as an accident more truly than in the case of Chernobyl, where stupidity became a more obvious factor in the series of events leading up to the accident.  It should not be unusual, now, for Americans to have some opinions about mistakes that were made in the design and testing of Chernobyl Unit No. 4, particularly after seeing how much of the building surrounding it was destroyed on April 26, 1986, as shown in the picture on page 80 of this book, at the start of Chapter 11.  Blowing the top off the reactor was the first clue the operators had that they needed to call some fire departments to help battle the blaze.  Wilborn Hampton does not give a definite temperature for what happened at Chernobyl, or at Alamogordo, New Mexico on July 16, 1945 (p. 3), or at Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945, or at Nagasaki three days later (p. 4), but \\"It was estimated that the temperature at the point the bomb exploded exceeded 10,000 degrees.  Heat engulfed the city.\\"  (pp. 4-5).<br />The efficiencies of producing electrical power from heat and steam seem to improve as temperatures rise above what a plant burning coal would produce, but the danger that human beings will misunderstand what is happening in such situations is one of the most frightening aspects of dangerous situations that people do not know how to control.  The first of the problems reported at Three Mile Island were some unusual radiation leaks.  Page 18 shows a March 30 story by Richard D. Lyons (Special to the New York Times) that described \\"large amounts of water containing small amounts of radioactivity\\" released by \\"the almost new generating plant.\\"  The element of human error involved in the situation might be due to that:<br />\\"Because of the radioactive water and gas within the containment building, no one was able to go back inside Unit No. 2 to make an assessment of the damage.  All they had to go on was information transmitted from instruments that might have been damaged by the accident.  When Miller ordered readings taken on the amount of heat and the level of radiation that were building up inside the reactor, the results were so high--one showed that the temperature in the top of the reactor was over 4,000 degrees--that he thought the equipment was simply malfunctioning and so he discounted them.\\"  (p. 25)<br />It was hot, and a large hydrogen gas bubble at the top of the reactor's core suddenly became the major technical fact that most of the drama from page 30 on makes people start to worry about a meltdown.  Conflicting stories in the press about the possibility of a hydrogen explosion kept Harold Denton, Joseph M. Hendrie, Roger Mattson, and Victor Stello arguing until there was a press conference after midnight that announced President Jimmy Carter would visit Three Mile Island the next day.  (p. 61).  Even Rosalynn was on the old yellow bus that took them to the island.  The major scientific revelation is the description of the argument that was going on at the same time:<br />\\"The radiolysis was not producing new oxygen that might trigger the hydrogen bubble.  Some of the water in the reactor was indeed separating into hydrogen and oxygen molecules, but because there was so much extra hydrogen, the oxygen was constantly combining with it to form back into water.  The bubble was, in effect, a built-in self-defense against an explosion.\\"  (p. 66).<br />After the bubble shrank from 1,000 cubic feet to about fifty cubic feet, a radiation level of 30,000 rems an hour inside the containment building was announced, lethal enough to make shutting it down an expensive problem.  The UPI article by Wilborn Hampton shown on page 72 reports the comments of George Boyer, the 76-year-old owner of a general store \\"just across the street from the bridge that leads to ThreeMile Island and its crippled nuclear plant. . . .  During the years of building the nuclear plant, Boyer's store was a hangout for the hundreds of construction workers. . . . `I remember everything went real smooth on No. 1 -- no problems at all,' he said.  `But No. 2 (the reactor that malfunctioned), there were always problems.' \\"<br />Sometimes things work, and sometimes there ought to be a way to go back to the beginning and do it right, but that never happens.  There are a few reports of human error in this book and problems with valves that didn't seem quite as important as that general sense that when things weren't going right, at least someone was willing to describe the system as stable.Mile Island and its crippled nuclear plant. . . .

Strauss, Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission quoted at the top of page 14 in this book, CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTER by Nichol Bryan (World Almanac Library, 2004).  The book attempts to provide individual insights on the issues which remain, which have often become political arguments about problems that remain to be solved.  The technology involved showed tremendous advances since basic subatomic particles started to be identified after the discovery of the neutron in 1932, but simply providing electricity to an advanced infrastructure for modern societies required unprecedented dependability that was keeping people up at all hours when most people will be better off sleeping.<br />\\"No wonder so many countries invested heavily in nuclear power -- the United States alone built more than one hundred plants between 1944 and 1985.  The amount of U.S. electricity provided by nuclear power grew to 20 percent.  In countries such as France, with fewer coal supplies, almost three-quarters of all electricity was generated by nuclear power plants by the mid-1980s.\\"  (pp. 14-15).<br />\\"People became concerned about how to dispose of the used atomic fuel rods, which remained dangerously radioactive for thousands of years.  Plutonium, one of the elements in these `spent' fuel rods, is also one of the deadliest substances known.  And, plutonium can be used to make atomic bombs.  Many worried that the spread of nuclear power plants could lead to more countries having nuclear weapons.\\"  (p. 15).<br />Chapter 2 describes the safety test run on the Unit 4 reactor at Chernobyl in April, 1986.  In the event of other electrical failures, the electricity provided by the turbine for that reactor core might not be enough to shut down the operation of the reactor.  \\"Because the same water that cooled the reactor also ran the turbines, the process that controlled the reactor started to seesaw.  As the turbines turned faster, the water flowed more quickly in the reactor and cooled it down.  Consequently, as the heat in the reactor dropped, it produced less steam to power the turbines, so the turbine slowed down.  Plant operators made constant adjustments to the speed of the turbines and the placement of the control rods in a frantic attempt to control the reactor.\\"  (p. 19).  The neutrons in the core of the reactor were able to produce a chain reaction much faster than anyone could insert control rods to slow down the neutrons that generated heat by splitting atoms when \\"At 1:23 A.M., the operators at Chernobyl lost the battle.  Power output in the reactor suddenly jumped to one hundred times the normal amount.  The radioactive fuel in the reactor core started to burst apart.  The steam in the reactor core exploded.  Seconds later, another explosion ripped through the reactor.  The twin explosions destroyed the core of Unit 4 and blew off the reactor's 1,100-ton (1,000-tonne) roof.\\"  (p. 20).<br />\\"By late afternoon, many of the smaller fires around the plant had been put out.  Then a new blaze erupted.  The graphite used in the reactor core began to burn.  Graphite is a form of carbon, similar to coal.  It burns with an intense heat.  Firefighters couldn't put out the graphite fire with water.  It burned for ten days, sending more radioactive smoke into the air.\\"  (p. 21).  One of the firefighters' wives said, \\"It was strictly forbidden to talk about this.  `Your husbands got poisoned with gases,' the families of the firefighters were told.\\"  (p. 23).<br />This book identifies the person responsible for informing the world that a catastrophe was taking place:<br />\\"On April 28, Cliff Robinson, an engineer at Forsmark Nuclear Plant 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Uppsala, Sweden, walked through a radiation detector to get to his office.  He was startled to hear the alarm go off.  When Robinson measured the radioactivity of hisshoes, he found levels never seen around the plant before.  `My first thought was that a war had broken out and that somebody had blown up a nuclear bomb,' Robinson recalled.\\"  (pp. 27-29).  Some people's feelings were hurt by the announcements which followed, and President Ronald Reagan's press secretary Larry Speakes carefully defended the position of the United States by declaring:<br />\\"The United States Government at no point encouraged inaccurate reporting on the accident.  If some reports carried in the mass media were in fact inaccurate, this was an inevitable result of the extreme secrecy with which the Soviet authorities dealt with the accident in the days immediately following it.\\"  (p. 32).<br />The biggest disagreement has been in the number of people who are dying as a result, and the miraculous survival of all the people who are not dead yet.  The media recently have shown a real interest in reporting the precise numbers of people who died due to any particular incident, however daily such incidents might have become.  There aren't any wild numbers in this book, like a global 500,000 or the 100,000 abortions sought by women who had been exposed to radiation and did not want to risk giving birth to a monster.  \\"Ukrainian nuclear experts estimate that more than two thousand five hundred deaths were caused by the disaster.

US	44184384	R1BQYCO2MHUKHM	3882439211	432233826	Zones of Exclusion: Pripyat and Chernobyl	Books	4	8	18	N	N	I enjoyed seeing this, but it doesn't answer many questions	There is only one page of text in this book.  Page 7, written by Elizabeth Culbert in New York City in April 2003, explains how Pripyat, a community of homes for workers from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, was evacuated 36 hours after tons of radioactive material had been released, hauling 50,000 people away in a fleet of buses.  &quot;Mandatory evacuation continued over the next 10 days, forcing 116,000 people to depart from towns and villages within 30 kilometers of the plant--this area would be named the exclusion zone. . . . Today the elderly are allowed to stay; children are not.  No one is permitted to live within a 10-kilometer radius of Chernobyl.  Pripyat remains abandoned.&quot;<br />&quot;Nearly 350,000 people were moved from contaminated regions of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, though hundreds of thousands still live in areas unsuitable for habitation--unsuitable not only because of radioactivity, but also because of severe socio-economic and psychological pressures. . . .  With limited local capacity to deal with health, economic and environmental challenges, living conditions spiral downward.&quot;  Thousands of Ukrainians would like the Chernobyl plant to reopen to provide jobs and power to the region.  But the danger of the collapse of the existing structure over the &quot;200 tons of uranium and a ton of radioactive plutonium&quot; at Chernobyl make it a bad place to risk having more explosions so close.<br />The pictures are monumental, as only pictures of a catastrophe can come close to capturing the essence of the slow deterioration of nuclear decay.  The picture on the cover, repeated on page 41, shows a farewell written on a red rectangle mounted on a light green wall.  Very institutional colors and furnishings, but the paint on the walls is peeling, and plaster around the window fell over everything in the picture.  The title of the book is written at the far edge of the ceiling:<br />Zones of Exclusion  PRIPYAT AND CHERNOBYL.<br />The book is printed in Germany, and the photographer, Robert Polidori, was given the necessary visas and authorizations to enter the area around Chernobyl in Ukraine to take these pictures on June 6-9, 2001.  Nearly at the end of the book, there is a picture, &quot;Robert Polidori in the Unit 4 control room.  Photograph by Konstantin Leifer, June 6, 2001.&quot;  The page before that has captions for the other pictures in the book, starting with:<br />3-4  Sarcophagus over the Unit 4 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.<br />Pages 1 and 2 are blank, and the picture of the sarcophagus on page 3 only has text on a sign just below the barbed wire at the top of a gray block wall, but the text is too small and faint to read.  There is a crane between the camera and the sarcophagus which looks like a combination of toothpicks.  I assume the cranes in these pictures are now too contaminated to be used elsewhere, though this book does not have any pictures of them glowing in the dark.  Page 4 shows the crane from another angle, closer to the side of a structure that is almost as large as the sarcophagus.<br />Page 5 has the title.  Page 6 shows an entryway with a sign &quot;Contamination Control Post&quot; in English.  Page 9 shows a mall with buildings that used letters of the Russian alphabet for their signs.  Trees are growing, even in the cracks in the pavement.  The pictures on pages 10-11 show buildings with the nuclear power plant in the background.  A lightpost on page 11 has trees close enough to hide some of the power lines in the bottom corner of the picture, but there would not be power in the line, so the trees don't need to be trimmed.  Pages 12-15 show electrical transfer stations with high-voltage wires, with the nuclear power plant in the background.  There are still a few guards and a STOP sign at the nuclear power plant on page 17.  Page 26 is blank except for the page number because the picture on page 27 is huge, showing the Unit 4 control room in the damaged condition that fate left it in.  Page 28 is blank because it marks a transition to pictures of a kindergarten classroom that has been neglected for years.  There were a lot of beds in the nursery on page 33, but the mattresses are falling apart.  I think the doll on page 36 might have been posed, like the chair sitting on the top of a desk near a picture of Lenin and some kids on page 37.  The dangling light fixture on page 39 looks as likely to crash down as the other metal channels lying about, and they don't look they were part of the ceiling.  The library on page 49 is really messed up.  A lot of people left their gas masks in the cafeteria on page 53.<br />Then there are pictures of an abandoned hospital, vacant residential buildings, vehicles that ought to be buried, old boats in the harbor, and small pictures of little places.  Trees that used to grow around the nuclear power plant are now lying in rows of piles in fields of radioactive logs.  This book makes the catastrophe seem pretty recent, compared to how long people ought to wait before these areas are populated again.amaged condition that fate left it in.

US	44184384	R3E971JYVJHP40	002718305X	354617314	Chernobyl: The Ongoing Story of the World's Deadliest Nuclear Disaster	Books	5	1	2	N	N	This attempts to understand the radioactive aftermath	The reactor at Chernobyl was too large and too well engineered to produce the kind of explosion that is considered typical for weapons, but it was capable of reaching temperatures that were much higher than mere fireman could cool by spraying water on the blaze.<br />For most of the people involved in fighting the fire, the temperature was a minor problem compared to the radioactive storm of particles and rays released in the reaction.  The operators in the control room thought they had some control over the reaction long after two explosions had flipped the concrete lid over the reactor and blew the roof off a large building.  Everyone who was not vaporized immediately knew that the reactor core had not exploded in the typical mushroom cloud catastrophe which is so familiar from hundreds of weapons tests.  Due to a fire, they did not have access to equipment which could have told them how high the level of radiation being released from the core had grown, but that level was so high, it could have produced panic, so large numbers of people would never be told.  Medical science is not really up to date on what people who are subject to such a subatomic particle ambush can expect for the rest of their lifespan, and all the doctors in the Soviet Union worked for the government, which never planned to tell the people much about anything.<br />The book, CHERNOBYL THE ONGOING STORY OF THE WORLD'S DEADLIEST NUCLEAR DISASTER by Glenn Alan Cheney, makes an honest effort to look at everything that people might learn from studying all the forms of subatomic particle ambushes that took place as a result of the Chernobyl secret circus stunt.  The sense of condemnation which drives this book is fought by those who had avoided for so long the question:  Who is Oedipus here, and who the Sphinx?  The science found itself starting off on a strange foot:<br />\\"The victims suffered from radiation and heat burns.  Their skin was browned like toasted marshmallow.  In some places it was black like burned marshmallow.  Their skin cracked, blistered, peeled, hung in strips. . . .  Their hair fell out.\\"  (p. 43).<br />\\"The world outside the Soviet Union knew more about what was happening than the victims it was happening to.  On April 28 Sweden registered the first signs of a radioactive mishap.  A monitoring station noticed rising levels of radioactivity.  Further analysis revealed a bizarre array of rare isotopes, a combination not normally produced by an atomic explosion or a nuclear reactor leak.  One of the isotopes was ruthenium, which melts only at 4,050 degrees F (2,250 degrees C)--a temperature found only on the sun, in a melting nuclear reactor, or, for an instant, in a nuclear bomb.  An assessment of atmospheric conditions pointed at the Soviet Union.  Sweden announced the discovery and made diplomatic inquiries to Moscow.  At first Moscow admitted to nothing but later conceded a trifling accident, a quick and minor release of radioactivity.\\"  (p. 83).<br />This book ought to be praised most highly for its attempt to picture what happens when subatomic particles ambush people in a way which the reader can understand.  Ruthenium is not a particularly exotic chemical element, with an atomic number of 44 and an atomic weight of 101.07, it appears in the middle of the periodic table of elements in the transition elements, and as a metal it is useful in alloys for electrical contacts that don't wear or corrode.  It can be great stuff, if you know how to use it.  It was not the first thing that was noticed in Kiev at the Physics Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine on Monday morning, April 28, 1986:<br />\\"That Monday, officials were surprised to find radiation coming into the building.  It was on people's clothes.  These weren't people from Chernobyl or Pripyat.  They were people who had just ridden city buses to work, as they had every other morning.  But this morning, April 28, the buses were radioactive.  They'd been to Pripyat to pick up the evacuees.  The evacuees had left so much radiation on the buses that people who sat in the seats the next morning were wearing clothes that would qualify as hazardous materials.  Dosimeters showed that clothing had radiation levels five times higher than that allowed on equipment used to handle radioactive material, and thousands of times higher than that allowed to come in contact with people.\\"  (p. 85).<br />\\"The train station was probably the worst place to be.  As empty trains came into the city they pulled in clouds of radioactive dust.  The trains themselves were radioactive.  The crowd at the station was radioactive, with everybody radiating everybody else.\\"  (pp. 89-90).<br />Local effects in the United States varied.  \\"Levels of iodine 131 were lowest in the region around Texas, where the least rain had fallen, and the death rate there remained unchanged from the year before.\\"  (p. 102).<br />\\"According to information in DEADLY DECEIT, infant mortality also soared in Germany.  In the most heavily contaminated regions it rose 68 percent.\\"  (p. 104).<br />Before the incident at Chernobyl, Lyme disease, \\"caused by a bacteria that was harmless to humans before 1975 . . . first appeared around Lyme, Connecticut, a few miles from the Millstone nuclear power plant.  Millstone has leaked more radiation than any other U.S. nuclear power plant besides Three Mile Island, and in 1975 alone released some three million curies.\\"  (p. 106).ck up the evacuees.

US	44184384	R30CPCXYPDGCI4	0819561444	980877270	Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytical Meaning of History	Books	5	26	39	N	N	This makes Schopenhauer seem like a mere philosopher	This book has been a paperback since 1960.  I became a high school freshman in 1960 and graduated from high school in 1965, which isn't much of an achievement compared to reading this book.  I took English, World History, Chemistry, Physics, Latin, mathematics, but when I wanted to take Modern Problems my final year, I was assigned to Family Living instead, so there would be a better balance of boys and girls in both classes.  I doubt if LIFE AGAINST DEATH by Norman O. Brown has ever been assigned reading for either course.  Chapter 13, \\"The Excremental Vision,\\" and chapter 15, \\"Filthy Lucre,\\" in which \\"the psychoanalytical theorems about money question the rationality of the norm itself, of which money is the center,\\" work as strongly against the popular opinions propagated by public education as against any individual's sense of narcissistic needs.<br />LIFE AGAINST DEATH was written during a very religious time, and Chapter 14 starts with the circumstances of illumination as revealed in a paragraph from Martin Luther which ends with:<br />`But once when in this tower I was meditating on those words, \\"the just lives by faith,\\" \\"justice of God,\\" I soon had the thought whether we ought to live justified by faith, and God's justice ought to be the salvation of every believer, and soon my soul was revived.  Therefore it is God's justice which justifies us and saves us.  And these words became a sweeter message for me.  This knowledge the Holy Spirit gave me on the privy in the tower.'<br />While I find LIFE AGAINST DEATH enlightening, it seems to me that it was written ten or twenty years too early to include the historical circumstances that could allow an entire generation, the baby boomers, to illustrate the forms of consciousness which conclusively have now established \\"the doctrine of the universal neurosis of mankind,\\" or \\"it is a Freudian axiom that the essence of man consists, not, as Descartes maintained, in thinking, but in desiring.\\"  Norman O. Brown's attack on an overly civilized form of rationality makes play the ultimate form of freedom, and harnessing economic revenues to enrich those who possess the highest entertainment values has made the culture of celebrity far more observable than the forms of science and technology currently being pursued by modern society.<br />Ultimately, the Freudian view of repression makes me wish for the opportunity to digress into everything that is supposed to be secret in modern society.  Norman O. Brown provides an intellectual platform for viewing the ultimate comedy of our situation, in which the science of Eros is linked to the politics of bizarre behavior in a manner that can hardly avoid being pornographic.  In 2004, the comic punch line for naked prisoners hiding their heads inside sandbags while a female guard points to the pixilated part of the picture ought to be:  This is a stick-up.  Back in the 20th century, people didn't joke about what the map of Vietnam looks like, but I think American policy in Nam was only possible because the American people had never seen a credibility gap that looked exactly like the map of Vietnam before, and those who had certainly weren't going to be allowed to say anything.  American totalitarianism was demanding silence on secret circus stunt principles:  anyone who explained how the trick is done would spoil the fun for everybody.  Religion came to be treated like that kind of magic, in which God could be anything that we wanted him to be, and mental play became more like the \\"Vengeance is Mine\\" cartoon by Edward Sorel on page 10 of \\"The Nation\\" (July 5, 2004) which has five pictures of American flags, with thirteen stars in the first and forty-eight stars in the middle of the page, followed by four pictures of a God who is upset by death machines, but even more by other superpowers who insist on \\"BLAMING ME FOR THEIR ATROCITIES!  That's when I began sending them global warming and schmuck presidents . . .\\"  Anyone who is aware of the real problems that modern societies face can hardly help but smile at the final picture of God waving a finger and proclaiming:  \\". . . AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING!!\\"<br />Part Three:  DEATH of LIFE AGAINST DEATH offers three chapters; the first is only ten pages on the theory of instincts.  Conflict arises from ambivalences which have long been known.  \\"Freud correctly found a model for his own view in the pre-Socratic philosopher Empedocles, who found the ultimate principle of the universe to be the eternal conflict between love and strife.\\"  Chapter 8, \\"Death, Time, and Eternity,\\" is considering the repetition-compulsion when it mentions a psychoanalytical abolition of time based on Kant's doctrine.  \\"This Copernican revolution makes time a psychological, not an ontological, problem for psychoanalysis.  It also, as Schopenhauer saw, opens up the possibility of man's emancipation from the tyranny of time.\\"<br />Chapter 5, \\"Art and Eros,\\" suggests \\"that art is essentially an opiate of the people, an escape into an unreal world of fantasy indistinguishable from a full-blown neurosis, both art and neurosis having the basic dynamic of a flight from reality.\\"  A society based primarily on entertainment values functions best when people can adapt to roles in the fantasy conversations which provide its primary means of redemption, lines like, \\"These are not the droids you're looking for.\\"  Movies, comedy, and some great rock 'n' roll songs provide more modern examples of this mechanism than what people were taught about art in school, but there might be an art school somewhere which has a handle on this.

The main character was supposed to study law, but preferred to write poems, a few of which resulted in him being imprisoned in the Bastille for eleven months beginning in May 1717.  (p. 4).  More than most philosophers, Voltaire tended to pick targets which are similar to the points which are most dear to the hearts of modern comics.  Serious thinkers will also find much to admire in this book.  In Chapter 4, Voltaire's Conception of History, A. J. Ayer quotes &quot;Voltaire's summary of Charles's career, if only as a good example of his style of writing history:<br />&quot; . . . His strength of will, developed into obstinacy, caused his misfortunes in the Ukraine and kept him for five years in Turkey:  his generosity, degenerating into extravagance, ruined Sweden ; his courage, swollen into rashness, caused his death :  his justice developed sometimes into cruelty ; and in the last years of his life the maintenance of his authority came near to being tyrannical. . . .  He was the first man to be ambitious for conquest, without desiring to increase his possessions ; he wanted to win empires in order to give them away. . . . His life should teach kings how far a peaceful and happy government is superior to such an abundance of glory.&quot;  (pp. 87-88).<br />Voltaire's opinions tended to be stronger than the views that modern professors strive to achieve to arrive at balance in their writing.  While Voltaire criticized Charles XII in great depth, Ayer emphasizes Voltaire's enthusiasm for Peter the Great in his HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE UNDER PETER THE GREAT (Vol. 1, 1759, and Vol. 2, 1763).  Ayer's knowledge of history includes the section `Six English Historians' in Lytton Strachey's book PORTRAITS IN MINIATURE, in which a chapter on Hume, who lived during the lifetime of Voltaire, states that Voltaire &quot;was indeed a master of narrative, but was usually too much occupied with discrediting Christianity to be a satisfactory historian.&quot;  (p. 107).  The index includes entries for both Hume and Strachey for that page and others, even for Strachey &quot;as source, 10, 11, 58, 171.&quot;  (p. 181).<br />The book dares to have a conclusion along the same line as its subject:<br />&quot;When we look farther afield and observe such things as the recrudescence of fundamentalism in the United States, the horrors of religious fanaticism in the Middle East, the appalling danger which the stubbornness of political intolerance presents to the whole world, we must surely conclude that we can still profit by the example of the lucidity, the acumen, the intellectual honesty and the moral courage of Voltaire.&quot;  (p. 174).actory historian.&quot;  (p. 107).

Escher	Books	5	6	14	N	N	stark, gigantic, modern, you need a table to read this book	My appreciation of art has been so influenced by the power of photography to capture things as I see them that I fail to see the works of M. C. Escher as being very artistic.  If art is supposed to show the power of human beings to capture the essence of objects as we see them, Escher seems to be trying to show us things we could never see, but that try to be art like cinnamon rolls that come from a refrigerated can of dough and icing might try to replace real cinnamon rolls in our lives.  Of the eight small pictures shown around the weird building topped with stairs and a tiny tower on the cover of M C ESCHER by Sandra Forty published by TAJ BOOKS 2003, a square near the lower right corner looks like a swirling combination of reptiles cooked up from splotchy shapes as a pattern emerges from the 10 x 10 squares around the edges, the shape of which suggests a pan of something from the oven.<br />I was introduced to the work of M C Escher about 33 years ago, after I was an adult attempting to understand the ways in which highly educated people understand the world.  Or, in the case of M C Escher, there seems to be real questions about what people are doing here at all.  On the stairs at the top of the building on the cover, the outer 14 hooded walkers seem to be climbing, holding the outer railing in their left hands, while the 12 inner walkers pass them descending the stairs with their left hands on the inner railing.  The inner courtyard does not appear to be square, because the front wall is so much longer than the back, but due to perspective, each step appears to be higher or lower than any other step.<br />Maurits Cornelis Escher lived from 1898 to 1972, about the span of life of my grandparents, and page 5, which contains that information, also shows \\"House of Stairs\\" (my favorite Escher design) in the center of that page, though a larger copy, Plate 40 on page 51, is the same picture at about 6 inches by 12 inches.  There are only a few pages in this book that don't have pictures on them.  At the top of the pages of text up to page 11, there is a thin strip reproducing a long mural called \\"Metamorphosis\\" that is mainly black and white with a little color where a sky full of flying birds transforms into a city by a waterfront with a little bridge to a castle sitting on a chessboard.  Escher did a lot, he \\"left over 2,000 drawings and 448 lithographs, woodcuts, and engravings. . . .  His legacy is carefully guarded by the M. C. Escher Foundation at Baarn, The Netherlands.\\"  (p. 5).  It is not surprising that this book contains some pictures that I did not have before.  In the case of Plate 47, \\"Plane Filling Motif With Fish and Bird,\\" (p. 58) I quickly saw four fish with eyes like circles, but it took me awhile to see a bird in the center between them, with an eye that looked like the number \\"6\\" which first seemed to be a cartoonish swirl to depict motion in whatever the fish were swimming in.  There is nothing realistic in that picture:  it looks more like a ragged potholder than a photograph, but the page is so black it can't be anything but ink on a page, which is what it is.<br />Escher's work is not totally devoid of women.  One in a white dress is walking into \\"Convex and Concave\\" in Plate 56 (p. 67).  Plate 7 shows \\"Jetta (Escher's wife)\\" 1925 woodcut 49.2 x 27.8 cm, looking very proper, with a collar that extends from shoulder to shoulder, holding a flower in front of a dark outfit that shows nothing of her figure, with her eyes lowered so that she can only see the flower if she is seeing anything.  Her hair is neatly parted, but a tiny curl is visible by one temple.  The picture is so black and white, the impression is that only her face, the flower and her hand are white, while her collar, neck and aura are trying to reside somewhere in between the light and the mystery where the shadow of her nose meets the edge of her lips.  People who have worked with wood and a gouge will be able to detect each cut in the wood, and the only thing which is stark about the picture is that his use of technique is so visible.<br />A famous design, Plate 51 \\"Gravity\\" 1952 Lithograph and watercolor (p. 62), shows orange, purple, green, yellow, red, blue creatures standing on star-shaped planes with a point over the back of each creature.  One point is a bit off center, with the five points of the plane on which the yellow creature is standing close to the edges of the picture, though five more points offset in the background suggest that the shape continues around to the other side.  The creatures are arranged so each is shown from a different angle, each facing in a unique direction, but each seems to reflect the same dull recognition:  I Know, I know, i know, i . . .d, and the only thing which is stark about the picture is that his use of technique is so visible.<br />A famous design, Plate 51 \\"Gravity\\" 1952 Lithograph and watercolor (p. 62), shows orange, purple, green, yellow, red, blue creatures standing on star-shaped planes with a point over the back of each creature.

It helps to have a few concert DVDs to promote an understanding of who does what in The Grateful Dead, but it would be impossible to know everything about the people who have been in the band without a very large book, as this one is, and the things that they have done, including an album in 1975 called &quot;Keith &amp; Donna&quot; and the album cover for which Jerry Garcia &quot;provided a whimsical drawing on the forehead of the Godchauxs' son Zion that would comprise the album's front cover, and the sessions enjoyed a similarly comfortable intimacy, since they were mostly recorded at Keith and Donna's home.&quot;  (p. 179).  I was not particularly aware of the Grateful Dead in 1975, Keith had joined the group as a pianist for the 1971 fall tour when &quot;Pigpen was missing gigs because of a debilitating liver condition.&quot;  (p. 136).  Donna &quot;joined the band as a backup singer in the spring of 1972, and stayed until the winter of 1979.&quot;  (p. 142).  &quot;Pigpen's Last Show&quot; was June 17, 1972 (p. 145).<br />People who go to concerts to hear someone sing some songs they know with enthusiasm would have liked Pigpen best.  When Warner Bros. Records Inc. was trying to promote &quot;Live/Dead&quot; on &quot;The Big Ball&quot; back in 1970, it included six and a half minutes of &quot;Turn on Your Love Light&quot; with notes that described it as &quot;the extravagantly soulful rendition of `Love Light,' here performed for your listening pleasure by Mr. Pigpen.&quot;  GRATEFUL DEAD THE ILLUSTRATED TRIP describes Pigpen as a performer that audiences loved who &quot;always had more nerve than I could believe,&quot; (p. 19), as Jerry Garcia said.  He was born as Ron McKernan, and it was only 16 years later that he dropped out of high school and hooked up with Jerry Garcia in 1961 when Garcia got out of the army and &quot;he took up the harmonica and everyone called him Blue Ron.&quot;  (p. 18).<br />The timeline in the book starts with the birth of Philip Chapman Lesh on March 15, 1940.  A lot of information can be located in the index, but there is nothing listed there for arrests, which tended to happen to people associated with the acid trips that were public events in California before LSD became an illegal substance.  A lot of titles can be found in the index under &quot;Albums/CDs (GD and solo band members)&quot; (p. 470), &quot;books on Grateful Dead&quot; (p. 471), &quot;films/videos&quot; (p. 472), and &quot;songs (GD and solo band members)&quot; (pp. 476-478).  Counting lines in the index, it appears that &quot;Dark Star&quot; and &quot;Drums&quot; are mentioned on more pages than &quot;Turn On Your Love Light,&quot; which appears at least 29 times in this book.  For those who are interested in tours, the index lists 21 by name, though six of those are &quot;Europe '70&quot; through &quot;Europe '02&quot; (p. 478).<br />Robert Hunter gets credit for the lyrics of a lot of Grateful Dead songs.  There are ten songs on the album &quot;American Beauty,&quot; which has a cover that can also be read as &quot;American Reality&quot; because a squiggly B looks like an R, and U could be LI (p. 124), nine of which have words by Hunter.  The exception is &quot;Operator&quot; by McKernan, who only got credit for performing harmonica and vocals on that album.  It is tough to play keyboards on songs that have not been written yet, something that only a real musician would even attempt, and Pig Pen was not good at intuiting what the other players were going to do.  His song is a conventional ditty, but the rest of the group was so good, they could make him sound like he fit in.  They needed him while he was healthy to attract crowds who will flock to a blazing spectacle, but his life span was typical for what can happen to kids who start heavy drinking at the age of 12.  &quot;Operator&quot; was &quot;one of only four Pigpen originals recorded by the band.&quot;  (p. 121).  &quot;American Beauty&quot; starts with a song that deserves some explanation:<br />&quot; `Box of Rain' served as a tribute to Lesh's sick father and is packed with symbolic imagery, from the `walk into splintered sunlight' that echoes common reports of near-death experiences to the cleansing rain that promises to `ease the pain.'  `Phil Lesh wanted a song to sing to his dying father and had composed a piece complete with every vocal nuance but the words,' Hunter wrote in the compendium of lyrics he named after the song. . . .  After serving as the very last song the Dead would ever play live with Jerry Garcia, `Box of Rain' routinely appeared in sets by Phil's side project, Phil and Friends, as well as in sets by The Other Ones.&quot;  (p. 121).<br />All of the DVDs I have in the LIVE IN CONCERT set have Brent Mydland on keyboards.  Born in 1952, he might have been trying too hard to catch up with the other guys when he died from a mix of morphine and cocaine shortly after the end of the summer tour in 1990.  When I have been criticized for singing, it is often for traits he displayed.  &quot;Some liked his soulful vocals and B-3 organ playing.  But detractors felt his aggressive and even hostile vibe, as shown in some of his songs, was out of place at Dead shows.&quot;  (p. 380).  The use of the word &quot;Dead&quot; in that sentence seems particularly apt, but this whole book is like that.<br />Shortly thereafter, in April 1991, Various Artists performing songs originally by the Grateful Dead called their album &quot;Deadicated.&quot;  (p. 388).

Back in 1790-1793, Blake produced THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL, an idea so rancid that it might be compared to finding Hosea's wife in a city named Saint Paul.  In this age of modern conveniences, smart shoppers are like cooks who prefer to find such ideas separated into rolls and placed side by side in a well greased pan, and publishers have found authors who are willing and able to accomplish this over and over, so that a well stocked library will offer many books on shelves that are hardly large enough to hold volumes of the size that makes Blake's art appear most splendid.  Most of the pictures shown in this work are black and white, but a few in color blaze with life.<br />Large books are often great monuments to tremendous sources of inspiration, and old studies of fields in which academic interest has been high can offer a wealth of knowledge that smaller books could only hint at.  A work like BLAKE AND TRADITION by Kathleen Raine, illustrated with numerous examples of pictures that depict the most stirring examples of Blake's imagination, including &quot;The symbolic representation of the female genitals as a shrine or chapel&quot; on page 196 of Volume One, is packed full of the things that any thinking member of modern society needs to be highly aware of just to keep up with everything that is going on.  I shouldn't have to say too much about this.  The directions on the rolls say:  do not over bake.	2004-04-18
US	44184384	R1MWLG5BGP7U3X	157322751X	144250243	Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human	Books	5	1	15	N	N	This book covers a lot of territory	This gigantic book summarizing a lifetime of teaching Shakespeare would not seem so familiar to me if the shocks of recognition were not always so close to the truths that I value most highly.  My knowledge of Shakespeare is not much, but the information this book contains about plays that loomed large in Walter Kaufmann's books FROM SHAKESPEARE TO EXISTENTIALISM and TRAGEDY AND PHILOSOPHY largely supports a bracing view of the worst things that Shakespeare could find to say about people.  A few years ago, at a performance of the play &quot;Cymbeline,&quot; I seemed to be much more disturbed than other members of the audience, seeing it in an intimate setting that put people on folding chairs close enough to feel that we were all taking part in what was going on.  Harold Bloom adds to that feeling of intimacy by declaring:<br />&quot;Iago, like Hamlet and Macbeth, is beyond us, but we are Iachimo.  Our bravado, malice, fearfulness, confusion are all in Iachimo, who is not much worse than we are, and whom Shakespeare intends to spare.&quot;  (p. 637).<br />I have a DVD collection (3 discs), LIVE DEAD, THE GRATEFUL DEAD IN CONCERT, which has an interview with the band, probably the special Dead Facts fan quiz on the GRATEFUL DEAD:  TICKET TO NEW YEAR'S recorded at the Oakland Coliseum on December 31, 1987, in which some fan wants to know what they think the words of the song, &quot;Iko Iko&quot; mean:  &quot;Jockamo fee na - ne'.&quot;  It sounds like Iachimo to me, and the attitude that the band adopts to come up with a reasonable explanation which will not produce any more questions is worthy of a truly comic society.  The song has been around since 1964, and one verse is like a Shakespeare play:<br />&quot;Look at my king all dressed in red.<br />Iko.  Iko, unday.<br />I betcha five dollars he'll kill you dead.<br />Jockamo fee na - ne'.&quot;<br />Incidentally, there is a version of &quot;Iko-Iko&quot; on the Warren Zevon CD &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive,&quot; which also has his song &quot;She Quit Me&quot; which was used in the movie &quot;Midnight Cowboy,&quot; which is pretty good if you want to see Dustin Hoffman playing a character called Ratso.<br />Bloom dates &quot;Cymbeline&quot; to 1609-10, with Shakespeare returning to Stratford in 1610 for semi-retirement (p. xiv), which allowed him to turn on his work with what Bloom regards as &quot;unmistakable overtones of his personal distaste for the London of 1609-10.&quot;  (p. 615).  The larger question is &quot;the question of Shakespeare himself.  What was he trying to do for himself as a maker of plays by the heap of self-parodies that constitute `Cymbeline'?&quot;  (p. 621).  Obviously, &quot;Shakespeare is his own worst enemy in `Cymbeline':  he is weary of making plays.&quot;  (p. 621).  Bloom still finds some good poetry:<br />&quot;Golden lads and girls all must,<br />As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.&quot;  (p. 629).<br />The six lines of [V.iv. 146-51] are so good that they show up on page 634 and 635 as &quot;Compulsive self-parody&quot; which leads to &quot;It is another of those uncanny recognitions in which Shakespeare is already beyond Nietzsche.&quot;  (p. 636).<br />It is easy for me to look up plays that other people might think are awful.  Bloom thinks that &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; was never staged at the Globe because it &quot;might seem too lively a satire upon the fallen Earl of Essex, who may be the model for the play's outrageous Achilles,&quot;  (p. 327).  Thersites denies having any honour:  &quot;no, no:  I am a rascal, a scurvy railing knave:  a very filthy rogue.&quot;  (p. 329).  Margarelon told him, &quot;The devil take thee, coward.&quot;  (p. 329).  Bloom is sympathetic.  &quot;If we can trust anyone in the play, then it must be Thersites, deranged as doubtless he is.&quot;  (p. 332).<br />&quot;Timon of Athens&quot; is considered unfinished.  &quot;Shakespeare appears to have to have abandoned `Timon of Athens,' for reasons stillunclear.  He never staged it, and parts of it are less finished than others.&quot;  (p. 588).  There are a few examples of &quot;venereal invective&quot; (p. 596) that were ultimately dismissed as unworthy of himself.  &quot;This hymn to syphilis is unmatched and unmatchable.&quot;  (p. 597).  There are topics which are far more worthy of poetry in this book, and the book makes every effort to present explanations which make the poetry worth understanding.  Not every reader in our society will make the effort to find what they want in Shakespeare.  This book will make sense to people who would want to know all this, whether it will do them any good or not.<br />This is April.  &quot;Shakespeare was christened on April 26, 1564, at Stratford-on-Avon, and died there on April 23, 1616.&quot;  (p. xiii).  He only lived to the age of 52, more or less.

US	44184384	RFU0VIW4IUEZ1	0691058385	706937271	The Crooked Timber of Humanity	Books	5	2	18	N	N	This point might be too sharp for you	There is an index for this collection of essays, but it does not find much to point to about the United States of America, except where particular examples get mixed in with the clutter of events that are described as the context of the rise of nationalism:<br />&quot;So too, it may be that no minority that has preserved its own cultural tradition or religious or racial characteristics can indefinitely tolerate the prospect of remaining a minority forever, governed by a majority with a different outlook or habits.  And this may indeed account for the reaction of wounded pride, or the sense of collective injustice, which animates, for example, Zionism or its mirror-image, the movement of the Palestinian Arabs, or such `ethnic' minorities as Negroes in the United States or Irish Catholics in Ulster, the Nagas in India and the like.  Certainly contemporary nationalism seldom comes in its pure, romantic form, as it did in Italy or Poland or Hungary in the early nineteenth century, but is connected far more closely with social and religious and economic grievances. . . .&quot;<br />A footnote which quotes the organ of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party for 20 July 1972 shows an awareness of the global side of the picture:<br />&quot;Between national and international interests not only is there no contradiction, but, on the contrary, there is a full dialectical unity.&quot;<br />By implication, the index identifies the policies of the United States of America with the belief that it can foster countervailing forces<br />&quot;as a barrier to unbridled chauvinism - seems about as realistic (at least so far as lands outside western Europe are concerned) as Cobden's belief that the development of free trade throughout the world would of itself ensure peace and harmonious co-operation between nations.  One is also reminded of Norman Angell's apparently unanswered argument a short while before 1914 that the economic interests of modern capitalistic states alone made large-scale wars impossible.&quot;<br />For me the most interesting part of THE CROOKED TIMBER OF HUMANITY by Isaiah Berlin is in the middle of the book:  &quot;Joseph de Maistre and the Origins of Fascism.&quot;  Written in the twentieth century, it is not surprising that this essay attempts to consider the political ideas which had previously supported an old order as the ideological foundation for the worst enemy of freedom as a realm of modern thought.  The Bible serves as an easier reference for me, particularly the books of Kings, in which it is reported, &quot;Ahab also put up a sacred pole and committed other crimes as well, provoking the anger of Yahweh, the God of Israel, more than all the kings of Israel who were his predecessors.&quot;  (I Kings 16:33).  Bad governments can come in many forms, but a prime example of how they operate can be found in I Kings 21:10 :<br />&quot;Confront him with a couple of scoundrels who will accuse him like this, `You have cursed God and the king.'  Then take him outside and stone him to death.&quot;<br />Joseph de Maistre is presented by Isaiah Berlin as a man who was above such suspicions.  &quot;Like Charles Maurras and T. S. Eliot, he stood for the trinity of classicism, monarchy and the church. . . . He is a Catholic reacrtionary, a scholar and an aristocrat . . .&quot;  And yet &quot;Maistre may have spoken the language of the past, but the content of what he had to say presaged the future.&quot;<br />Maistre was the son of a recently ennobled lawyer; he was considered a jurist, a diplomat, &quot;a philosophical critic and an exceptionally brilliant writer,&quot; a negotiator, and a man of affairs.  Born in 1753, Joseph de Maistre is described as &quot;the eldest of ten children of the President of the Senate,&quot; but we might not be familiar with this Senate because he was born in the dukedom of Savoy, part of the kingdom of Sardinia.  Looking for a foundation for his ideas is to seek a form of inversion:<br />&quot;An action in Maistre's universe is ineffective precisely in proportion as it is directed to the achievement of day-to-day interests, and derives from calculating, utilitarian tendencies which compose the outer surface of human character; and it is effective, memorable, in tune with the universe precisely to the degree to which it springs from unexplained and unexplainable depths, and not from reason, nor from individual will . . .  What is best and strongest is often violent, irrational, gratuitous, and therefore necessarily misrepresented, and made to seem absurd, only by being falsely ascribed to intelligible motives.  Human action in his sense is justified only when it derives from that tendency in human beings which is directed neither to happiness nor to comfort, nor to self-assertion and self-aggrandizement, but to the fulfillment of an unfathomable divine purpose which men cannot, and should not try to, fathom - and which they deny at their peril.  This may often lead to actions involving pain and slaughter, which in terms of the rules of sensible, normal, middle-class morality may well be regarded as arrogant and unjust, but which nevertheless derive from the dark unanalysable center of all authority.  This is the poetry of the world, not its prose, the source of all faith and all energy, whereby alone man is free, capable of choice, of creation and destruction, superior to the causally determined, scientifically explicable, mechanical movements of matter, or of natures lower than his, ignorant of good and evil.&quot;<br />Lately I have been advised that I should try working on something a bit more recent than MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK, but the copyright dates listed in the front of this book, 1959, 1972, 1975, 1978, 1980, 1983, 1988, 1990, must include years in which contemporary readers would consider Vietnam a topic which had been dealt with during years in which they were in kindergarten.

Nietzsche and, 1217-1218&quot; just before &quot;adaptation at the edge of chaos&quot; on page 1393.  This is an example of Nietzsche imagining intellectual traditions as being as undirected as a chain of individual organisms which exhibit changes, &quot;the causes of which need not be connected even amongst themselves, but rather sometimes just follow and replace one another at random.&quot;  (p. 1217).  The tradition is pictured as the range of contrasts that &quot;more or less mutually independent processes of subjugation exacted on the thing.&quot;  (p. 1217).  Nietzsche's use of historical method to emphasize a range of stages also fits Gould's &quot;principle of quirky functional shift&quot; on page 1231.  A fuller explanation later shows up:<br />&quot;The key to this expansion of evolutionary theory therefore lies in the category of currently useful traits with nonadaptive origins--my rationale for prefacing this topic with two sections to develop the prerequisites of the argument:  one on Nietzsche's principle of general discordance between bases of current utility and reasons for historical origin, and another on the terminology of exaptation as a framework for describing and appreciating the importance of currently useful structures coopted from a different ancestral status, rather than directly evolved for their present function.&quot;  (p. 1248).<br />&quot;SECONDARY AND CONSEQUENTIAL STATUS.  This common argument commits the historical error that inspired Nietzsche's warning.&quot;  (p. 1249).<br />&quot;Purely adaptationist analysis therefore cannot resolve history for two major reasons:<br />1.  Through the principle of quirky functional shift, and Nietzsche's discordance between reasons for current utility and sources of historical origin, our understanding of how a current trait works cannot elucidate its mode of origin--an ineluctably and logically central task of evolutionary explanation, and one of the most interesting questions that any historical science can pose.&quot;  (p. 1258).<br />This is fine as far as consideration of particular arguments goes, but it hardly brings out Nietzsche's foreboding that any future is still up for grabs among people who are willing to do anything if they think it will help them jump to the right conclusion.  As individuals within discrete communities, a paying relationship with a major part of the global economic structure is subject to as much competition as cooperation, and everyone might not be better off every time the poorest workers win their right to some compensation.

As individuals within discrete communities, a paying relationship with a major part of the global economic structure is subject to as much competition as cooperation, and everyone might not be better off every time the poorest workers win their right to some compensation.

A fading mentality that hardly has time for all of its thoughts, but impressed enough by modern knowledge of early epics to make bibliographies on the state of knowledge for various people, certainly for Charles Doria (pp. 50-51) and Ed Dorn (pp. 3-14), to establish:<br />&quot;. . . that logography and the muthologotic are in fact, prose to poetry and poetry to prose, one earth-bound matter:<br />&quot; or that it is taken literally in the discovery in the ground near Latakia or Ugaritic tablets, thus a poetry of some lines being therefore again new, or that Hittite and Sumerian text and poetry can now be placed beside the actual language and composition of the Rig-Veda, itself retained orally from a date prior to 1750 BC through some Englishman for the first time getting it into written and therefore readable as well as previously hearable for 4000 years, beside Celtic . . .&quot; (p. 50).<br />This small book collected some things that Charles Olson (1910-1970) wrote.  The copy that I have is from Four Seasons Foundation with copyrights for years from 1961 to 1974 &quot;by Charles Boer, Literary Executor of the Estate of Charles Olson.&quot;  The page numbers in this book are in brackets at the bottom of the page, with no numbers for pages before the main text.  There is no index, but notes on pages 81-109 attempt to explain a few highly scholarly materials.  There is not much poetry in this book, but judging from the examples, Charles Olson was a poet of a school which tended to be spaced quite like vast architectural monuments:<br />&quot;Lightness<br />shall descend<br />from<br />above:  a ship<br />is a church<br />upside-<br />  down&quot;  (p. 63).<br />That was along the left margin.  Near the right side of the page, starting on the line which had &quot;shall descend,&quot; is an explanation or citation:<br />&quot;shall not be soaring<br />vault VAULT SHORED-UP BY<br />BASTIONS [&quot;Flying-<br />volens:  BUTTRESSES]<br />Kirch Santa Clara Assisi&quot;  (p. 63).<br />There are many abbreviations and no list to explain what any of them might mean.  There is no index for looking up the names I already know like Homer, or might easily guess, like &quot;any of em as our kind of `You-liss-seas'?&quot;  (p. 11) or &quot;(say, Peek-gas-so, Prrrroost, JJJJoys,&quot; (p. 6) in the attempt to gain comprehensive knowledge on a frightening scale, but &quot;don't let that scare you:  I'm only trying to say how far bill WCW missed by not going behind Sam one Houston!&quot;  (p. 12).<br />The first question about a book like this is how reading it makes any sense.  I'm looking for the source of a single concept, proprioception, which might be capable of assuming that modern philosophy has reached a point in which the significance of any philosopher is primarily a matter of determining how well the philosopher perceived proprioceptive intellectual movements.  This reading of Charles Olson is supported by the assumptions and working premises at the beginning of &quot;A Bibliography on America For Ed Dorn&quot; on page 3 through the &quot;exercise of inversion&quot; (p. 4) because &quot; `TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE,' IS THE ONLY MORAL ACT WHICH CAN POSSIBLY CORRECT THE WEST, AS EITHER GREEK OR U. S.&quot;  (p. 5).  Alfred North Whitehead is called &quot;just the greatest, if you read only his philosophy.  If you read him on anything else, especially culture andor beauty, you realize that old saw, a man can't do everything!&quot;  (p, 7).  There is a chart on page 10 which puts &quot;viz, E. Dorn&quot; at the center of the page and &quot;MILLENNIA 12,000 BC to 1955 AD&quot; along a dashed line representing history in one of the top corners.  I tend to agree with the following advice:<br />&quot;Best thing to do is to dig one thing or place or man until you yourself know more abt that than is possible to any other man.&quot;  (p. 11).  Modern society might be considered an entertaining economic struggle among people who have competingideas about particular peoples and movements, with much woe for any people who expect conquering rulers to establish a particular morality among those enemies that can't be dispersed by aiming missiles at some leader in a wheelchair.  Much of the writing which follows that might be considered sketchy.  The grand concept that makes proprioception attractive as an avenue for further philosophy gets lost in a thread of words that can convey no more than what we have already learned about particular people, unless we have a tendency to be more ephemeral in the presence of words on a page.  At the end of the &quot;Introductory Note to the Bibliography, written December 9th, 1963&quot; we find:<br />&quot;You asked me for a curriculum.  I am proposing a re-arising of the Olympic Game:  the public is the body (Tantalus founded those Games by unhitching the linch-pin of the chariot of the father of the girl he wanted, then ruler of the place where the Olympic Games did start.

As far as civilized society goes, that is a period which did for human beings what a far more ancient period did for bees and ants.  There is no guide to pronunciation, but we might assume that it is not quite pronounced the same as hollow scene, an empty stage on which an audience expects something to happen, more or less civilized, depending on how popular a particular production has been.  In very intellectual circles, it might be suspected that THE MATING MIND by Geoffrey F. Miller is the most highly scientific book on \\"How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature,\\" as the subtitle puts it.  To find harem in the index, you can check \\"harem system of single-male polygyny, 76, 183\\" but you will find more if you also look under polygyny, where there is an entry for \\"runaway sexual selection and, 74, 98, 195.\\"  Harems don't always happen, but \\"To describe our ancestors as following mating patterns like `moderate polygamy' and `serial monogamy' is just a useful shorthand for identifying these sexual selection pressures.\\"  (p. 195).<br />Chapter 3, The Runaway Brain (pp. 68-98), compares the speed at which the human brain grew from the size common in apes with the speed at which the tails of a flock of birds would grow if the most fertile females prefer the male bird with the longest tail.  Long before the Holocene era, people who were fertile might have been more prone to rapid genetic change than we have observed lately because \\"One possible problem is that runaway sexual selection demands polygyny--a mating pattern in which some males mate with two or more females.  For runaway to work, some males must prove so attractive that they can copulate with several females to produce several sets of offspring.\\"  (p. 74).  Miller imagines this is likely to be driven by the sexual attractiveness of the male, but by the time we get to harems, I think my high school Latin teacher might have been closer to the mark when she told her class, \\"When the wolf is at the door, love goes out the window.\\"  As long as sex has been subject to a society's ideas about proper social standing or morality, women have been pawns who tend to end up with whichever male has the means to support a family.  Modern governmental efforts to collect child support from fathers who fled the family nest reflect how strongly the upper levels of a social structure believe in saddling its male pawns with financial obligations that conform to rigid economic patterns that would be a natural result of monogamous pairing.  History includes examples of the opposite.  \\"The first emperor of China reputedly had a harem of five thousand.  King Moulay Ismail of Morocco reputedly produced over six hundred sons by his harem.\\"  (p. 76).  \\"For millions of years, there was enough variation in male reproductive success to potentially drive runaway sexual selection during human evolution.\\"  (p. 76).<br />Even European societies experienced times when many women died in childbirth, and prosperous men might be expected to have a succession of wives who would be useful for raising the children as well as having more.  Some crazy book about Hitler's family even suggested that he came from an area of Europe where only a minority of peasants married.  When society puts a financial hurdle in the way of men who might otherwise choose a mate, a child born out of wedlock can easily produce suppositions about a small group of people who have known each other for a long time like the idea, for example, that Hitler's father (or maybe only his uncle) was also Hitler's grandfather.  Assuming that Hitler's mother was a young woman who had worked as a servant in the family of the man she subsequently married, is it still possible that Hitler's father was the illegitimate son of a woman who worked for a Jewish family until she became pregnant?  Then Hilter's other grandfather could have been Jewish, and laws against Germans working as servants for Jews were the proper German defense against such biological repetition of the Amalakite linkage of Eliphaz son of Esau and his concubine Timna in Genesis 36:12.  This is not quite the same as thinking that servants were harems, as Jacob's turned out to be in Genesis 35:22.  Nietzsche did not have any biological children, but there is a section called \\"Sexual Selection and Nietzsche.\\"  (pp. 337-339).  It might be easier to understand the six index entries for \\"Machiavellian intelligence theory\\" or to imagine that Nietzsche was the first philosopher who would totally agree with the point, \\"Plato and Hegel derogated art for failing to deliver the same sort of truth that they thought philosophy could produce.  They misunderstood the point of art.\\"  (pp. 282-283).<br />People who would criticize THE MATING MIND from the point of view of some morality might be misunderstanding something about the humor of history regarding sex.  I'm giving this book a high rating because it is willing to consider a multiplicity of factors in a scientific context in which theory is only meaningful if it relates to some form of behavior.  Comic societies will end up being most knowledgeable about sex because sex is more comic than any convention that society has ever been able to impose, and the Holocene is as good an example of diversity as any that I am aware of.dfather could have been Jewish, and laws against Germans working as servants for Jews were the proper German defense against such biological repetition of the Amalakite linkage of Eliphaz son of Esau and his concubine Timna in Genesis 36:12.

US	44184384	R2KXTNO6I6FKNB	031239621X	315902071	How Sweet It Is: The Jackie Gleason Story	Books	4	23	25	N	N	Full of interactions with the great one	This book is mainly about success in an era which shaped what American society is today:  high in entertainment values and celebrity personalities.  There is an appendix which offers a list of major accomplishments; Films, Major Television Shows, and Theater.  The final entry, for the classic play &quot;The Sly Fox&quot; in 1978, reveals that &quot;it almost rang down the final curtain.  In Chicago, he suffered a heart attack onstage in the final act but, with a trooper's instinct, finished the play.  He then underwent a triple bypass operation.&quot;  (p. 208).<br />Published in 1985, HOW SWEET IT IS:  THE JACKIE GLEASON STORY by James Bacon is an authorized biography in which the characters which Jackie Gleason played are as important as the people he met and the audiences who adored him.  The Foreword by Jackie Gleason is addressed &quot;Dear Jim, I have read the book . . .&quot; and admits &quot;Many are the times I have ended up wounded by a deep and ugly hangover after a day of wishful drinking.&quot;  (p. xi).  The Prologue admits that the author was barred from the set of a movie &quot;The Toy&quot; being filmed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1982 for being an evil companion responsible for getting Jackie Gleason drunk during production.  As Bob Hope said, &quot;An evil companion for Jackie Gleason?  I don't believe it.  He makes you look like an altar boy.  I don't believe it.&quot;  (p. xiv).<br />I was small when I was young, and Jackie Gleason was one of the heaviest people I ever saw on television.  Most of the pictures in this book show him younger than I remember him.  Henny Youngman was even younger than I remember him.  Chapter 10 is called &quot;Pow!  Alice, Right on the Kisser!&quot;  In Chapter 11, even one of his writers, Leonard Stern, had trouble seeing him.  &quot;He was in Doctors Hospital, either losing weight or getting over a hangover.  I went over there and the nurse told me the same thing--`Mr. Gleason is not well so he went home.'  I know the story has been around but it actually happened.&quot;  (p. 130).<br />Gleason hired Elvis for his summer replacement show.  &quot;Only there was a problem.  He was so damn good on that first show that Tommy and Jimmy [Dorsey] got pissed off.  They argued that they were supposed to be the stars, not Elvis.  Tommy had been through this same thing with Sinatra.  As a result, we only used Elvis a few times, not the six weeks I wanted.&quot;  (p. 141).  Soon Elvis had a movie contract signed with producer Hal Wallis, and was causing riots.<br />There is a picture of midget Billy Curtis holding at least five helium balloons and lots of string like a miniature statue of liberty in Los Angeles &quot;before the Great Gleason Express took off for a ten-day trip cross-country in 1962.&quot;  (3 pages before p. 109).  I think he must have started hopping.  &quot;Billy was holding too many balloons, and suddenly, the little guy was rising off the ground.  Gleason spotted little Reggie heading skyward and rushed out and grabbed him by the legs.&quot;  (p. 159).  Among the great moments of the trip:  &quot;the conductor yelled, `All aboard!' and the train chugged out of Union Station.  To the crowd waiting outside on the platform, Jackie gave his famous `Awa-a-a-a-y We Go!' yell and `Traveling Music' kick.&quot;  (p. 160).<br />The train trip cost his network $100,000, less than the house on the fairway of Inverrary Country Club at Lauderhill, Florida, given to him in 1973 to use his name for the Jackie Gleason Inverrary Classic stop on the PGA tour.  ` &quot;Look at that beautiful golf course.  Look at that blue sky with a few puffy clouds.  Why would anybody want to work with a life like this?&quot;  Whether it was golf, diet, cosmetic surgery, or whatever, Gleason's weight dropped from its onetime high of 289 pounds in the CBS days to 205 pounds in the early and mid-seventies.'  (p. 184).  I never weighed as much as that big guy on TV, but it is rather shocking to read that he later weighed less than I do now.  Many Americans now have a weight problem, and might even wish to have Gleason's dream house.  &quot;Instead of the twelve bars, it had one magnificent bar that would have done justice to the old Toots Shor's saloon.  In fact, it was reminiscent of Toots' circular bar, now torn down.  Jackie himself designed the barstools, from which it was impossible to fall off.&quot;  (pp. 184-185).hat he later weighed less than I do now.

Reading NIETZSCHE AND PHILOSOPHY by Gilles Deleuze in an English translation by Hugh Tomlinson, with a new Preface by Deleuze written for the translation in 1983 of a work originally published in French in 1962, serves as a reminder of the limits imposed on thoughts which are expressed within a scholarly milieu.  Philosophy is a goal which can easily be imposed upon Nietzsche because Nietzsche's writings show an in depth knowledge of pre-Platonic and Schopenhauer's philosophies, and a meaning restricted to the confines of decent philosophical practice is entirely praiseworthy.<br />What else could Nietzsche show?  Pornographic practices hardly fit well in a social setting, and Nietzsche's tendencies to show autoerotic mental patterns in his approach to what Deleuze designates as species activities and culture lie beyond the scope of anything considered in this book.  Nietzsche might also be thought to emphasize jokes and laughter somewhat more than Deleuze, who is not afraid to devote sections of this book to The Essence of the Tragic, The Problem of Existence, Hierarchy, Will to Power and Feeling of Power, Against Pessimism and against Schopenhauer, Realisation of Critique, The Concept of Truth, Art, The Problem of Pain, Bad Conscience, Responsibility, Guilt, Nihilism, Analysis of Pity, Nihilism and Transmutation:  the focal point, Affirmation and Negation, and even Dionysus and Zarathustra.  In fantasy as in reality, Nietzsche's ideas are suitable for consideration in a book on philosophy because they are capable of operating on a high level where \\"the selection of being which constitutes Nietzsche's ontology:  only that which becomes in the fullest sense of the word can return, is fit to return.\\"  (Preface to the English translation, p. xi).<br />Before proceeding to compare this book to the works of Nietzsche which it discusses, it behooves me to remind myself and others how I obtained knowledge of the market for books by building a collection of rejection slips for MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK, which culminated in a letter informing me that such a book was extralimital to the presses' goals, particularly in philosophy.  Even NIETZSCHE AND PHILOSOPHY seems to be aware of the joke which made a free world attack on godless Communists ironic:<br />\\"Pluralism is the properly philosophical way of thinking, the one invented by philosophy :  the only guarantor of freedom in the concrete spirit, the only principle of a violent atheism.  The Gods are dead but they have died from laughing, on hearing one God claim to be the only one, `Is not precisely this godliness, that there are gods but no God?'  (Z III `Of the Apostates', p. 201).  And the death of this God, who claimed to be the only one, is itself plural;  the death of God is an event with a multiple sense.  This is why Nietzsche does not believe in resounding `great events', but in the silent plurality of senses of each event (Z II `Of Great Events').  There is no event, no phenomenon, word or thought which does not have a multiple sense.\\"  (p. 4).<br />The very funny thing that separates Nietzsche from this totally philosophical reflection on his work is the declaration \\"and I have seen the truth naked, truly! barefoot to the neck.\\"  (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, II, \\"Of Great Events\\" translated by R. J. Hollingdale, p. 153).  Considering this pornographic is a sign of the loss of appetite for further thinking along this line.  Nietzsche appropriately saved this thought for after:<br />\\"And this is the tale of Zarathustra's conversation with the fire-dog:<br />\\"The earth (he said) has a skin; and this skin has diseases.  One of these diseases, for example, is called `Man'.<br />\\"And another of these diseases is called `the fire-dog':  men have told many lies and been told many lies about him.\\"<br />The sense of condemnation that clings to experiences of this nature might be considered anti-social when applied to an existing society.  Social activity is a narrow form of human endeavor, compared to which philosophy might be considered a vast wasteland, but one that is subject to considerable change.  Comparing books about philosophers to the philosophers themselves, including the things which they did not say in their books, but sometimes only in their notebooks, is an activity fraught with confusion.  Deleuze can be given credit for devoting much of his book to the philosophical context in which each philosopher has a unique self occupying a particular point in the grand sweep of ideas, but Deleuze and Nietzsche might not coincide in their views on particular individuals.  The first example in the book, on \\"Nietzsche's twofold struggle:  against those who remove values from criticism, contenting themselves with producing inventories of existing values or with criticising things in the name of established values (the `philosophical labourers', Kant and Schopenhauer, BGE 211)\\" (p. 2), does not mention the same philosophers as BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL section 211, in which Nietzsche observed:<br />\\"Those philosophical labourers after the noble exemplar of Kant and Hegel have to take some great fact of evaluation--that is to say, former assessments of value, creations of value which have become dominant and are for a while called `truths'--and identify them and reduce them to formulas, whether in the form of logic or of politics (morals) or of art.\\"<br />Nietzsche sometimes considered Schopenhauer a better kind of philosopher, as in \\"it is they who determine the Wherefore and Whither of mankind,\\" but subject to the question, \\"Are there such philosophers today?  Have there been such philosophers?  Must there not be such philosophers?\\"  (BGE 211).<br />Politics and philosophy have much in common.  As Deleuze wrote, \\"It is difficult in fact to stop the dialectic and history on the common slope down which they drag each other.  Does Marx . . . ?\\"  (p. 162).d been told many lies about him.\\"<br />The sense of condemnation that clings to experiences of this nature might be considered anti-social when applied to an existing society.

US	44184384	RUC9NAUWFANU	1576238822	475923660	Sheryl Crow; Guitar / Vocal edition with Tablature	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Old already, but it took time to learn all this	I have a Guitar/Vocal Edition with Tablature of this book:  SHERYL CROW (1997).  The first song in the book, \\"Ordinary Morning,\\" starts with a Slow blues (dotted quarter note equals 40) 12/8 time (ten measures/minute) vocal line in the key of B, with names of the chords G#m, G, C#, F#, and E7 above the first five measures to indicate the \\"Harmony implied by bass and keyboard.\\"  (p. 5).  The guitar tablature finally provides string and fret information for an A7 chord for the final six sixteenth notes (each a quarter of a second long) played on page 5.<br />This book does not show how to form every guitar chord for every song unless you look at the individual notes in the music and corresponding string and fret numbers in the tablature.  On page 12, under the title \\"If It Makes You Happy,\\" there is a chart showing the 23 fingering for the chord Em and a chart with x321 fingering for a C chord, but an \\"*\\" in the opening lines of the song for Gtrs. 1and for Gtr. 3 explains the open G tuning used for the tablature on pages 12-14.  C is formed in the early part of the song by using the fifth fret for the middle four strings or the 5 highest strings.  Because the fifth string has been tuned down (from A to G), the fingering shown in the chart for the chord Em at the top of page 12 could be used to play the first two eighth notes of an Am chord when the song finally gets to the word \\"happy\\" at the beginning of the chorus on page 14, but the second fret is also used for another string on the second beat in the chorus, and the notes which follow suggest the need for other fingers.  The Bridge which starts on page 15 has an Em chord and C chord used for Gtr. 2, and the explanation is on the last page of the book.  \\"Rhythm Slashes:  Strum Indications:  Strum with indicated rhythm.  The chord voicings are found on the first page of the transcription underneath the song title.\\"  (p. 124).  The Gtr. 2 at the Bridge must be using standard tuning to form the guitar chords as a typical Gtr. 2 would be following the written names of the chords at the beginning of the song.  Gtr. 1 drops out after four measures at the Bridge, but there are notes and Tablature there for Gtr. 4 (Elec.) and Gtr. 5 (Acoustic) playing Riff A \\"P.M. throughout.\\"  (p. 15).  The Guitar Tab Glossary by Kenn Chipkin and Aaron Stang on pages 123-124 (copyright 1990 Beam Me Up Music) explains that P.M. means Palm Mute.<br />Beginners learning music have to acquire mechanical techniques that must be practiced until they seem innate in order to produce a performance which adds elements that seem artistic.  Modern recording techniques have allowed fans to become familiar with the most sophisticated performances of pop songs as the modern form of artistic expression, with tremolo, trill, vibrato and staccato being just a few of the techniques that remain from the classical skill set.  Bending notes is a guitar trick that can be indicated in this book ranging from Microtone (to the equivalent of half a fret) to a whole step and a half.  The slide notes provided by Gtr. 3 in \\"If It Makes You Happy\\" don't start until after the vocal line \\"You get down, real low down.\\"  Then Gtr. 3 has eleven eighth notes before its first half note with seven slides between them, but the slides are all between two tones of a pattern that has just three musical tones.  After the line \\"You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train.  Well who hasn't been there before?\\" the slide goes up to a higher set of three tones, but with only four slides for ten notes.  At 98 beats per minute, each slide is taking place within three tenths of a second.<br />People who have the Sheryl Crow CD with these songs can look at the CD to see what the other songs are.  I actually like songs that are the easiest to learn.  Some of my favorites have a pattern of four chords that repeat throughout the song.  \\"Home\\" shows four chord charts under the title on page 62 and those chords dominate the song and the ending on page 75.  Only two additional chords occur in the Bridge on page 68.  Finding words might be a problem for people who don't automatically know them well enough to think of the right verse when the music is repeating.  Verse 2 appears in eight lines at the bottom of page 75, under the legato slides shown for the last three measures of \\"Home.\\"  Verse 1 has words under the vocal notes on pages 62-64.  Once the chorus starts and three guitar parts are shown, there are only four measures on page 64, five measures on pages 66 and 67, six measures on pages 68 and 69, and nine measures on each page 70-72.  Words for the vocal part on Verse 3 are under the notes on pages 71-72.  Most rock music does not show notes for vocal harmony parts, but the blend on the chorus of \\"Home\\" is so important that small notes are shown on pages 64, 65, 66, 70, and 71.  The harmony only has four musical tones, but with so much going on, it certainly helps to know what they are and when they change.

US	44184384	R1A47DPQK3SCZ6	0793560802	445791792	The Pretenders - The Isle of View	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Absolutely top quality	I have acquired most of what the Pretenders have produced, but since I've had this book, it is hard to think of anything that they did since this that is as good.  Maybe my taste is a bit soft and sentimental for a group that rocks as hard as the Pretenders.  A tragic outlook is prone to appreciate music for sympathizing with the sad moments of life.  The recent Pretenders CD \\"Screw Loose\\" [No, wait!  They called it \\"Loose Screw\\"] might be subject to more comic approaches in a society that values a variety of entertainment activities with new originality being most highly prized, but my heart was mainly grabbed most effectively in the 2003 \\"Pretenders Loose in L.A.\\" DVD by the use of their song \\"Biker\\" as a tribute to a dead rock star.  Chrissie Hynde must have also said something in that concert in memory of former members of the Pretenders, without whom we would not be where we are today.<br />This book has the music for 14 songs, 11 of them by Chrissie Hynde.  \\"Brass in Pocket\\" has words and music by Chrissie Hynde and James Honeyman-Scott.  \\"Hymn to Her\\" was written by Meg Keene.  \\"I Go to Sleep\\" is by Ray Davies, who leads The Kinks.  The book has 127 pages, and all of my favorite pages are devoted to the song \\"Revolution\\" (pp. 78-85, 124-127).  The top of page 124 shows fingerings for ten guitar chords.  Beginning guitar players might be familiar with the 231 fingering position for a standard E chord, but wonder why no one ever showed them a 341 fingering for F#m11 or a 134 fingering for a Bsus chord or a 134 fingering for a C#m7 chord before.  People who know the song \\"Revolution\\" should find quick ways to switch from one chord to another while maintaining the rhythm of that song.<br />The first line of notes on page 124 shows the quick lead-in played by a twelve-string acoustic guitar at the beginning of the song.  The TAB below the notes shows which strings and frets produce each note.  During the verse, that lead-in is repeated six and a half times.  The Verse directions include the strumming pattern for the second guitar, which plays the chords shown at the top of the page.  At the bottom of the page is \\"Rhy. Fig.3,\\" the third rhythm pattern, which features guitars one and two playing rhythm patterns except for the open pickup notes on two strings at the end of the line.<br />Page 125 has notes and TAB for the Pre-Chorus instrumental.  The bottom of the page shows the beginning of the Chorus:  Chords, rhythm, notes and TAB.  The Guitar Solo shows up on page 127, only four measures long, with the other guitar on Rhy. Fig. 3.  The music goes around and round before the CODA (four measures, which are repeated) and Outro (seven measures).<br />\\"Revolution\\" (1994) might be rock's most hopeful song on the topic.  It starts with children playing, but \\"what set us apart.  Couldn't wait for the real world to show us the strength of a lion's heart.\\"  This might look better as poetry:<br />The world is getting stranger, we'll never lose heart.<br />We just can't wait for the old guard to die before we can make a new start.<br />Bring on the revolution,<br />keep the pressure on,<br />I wanna die for something. . . .<br />I don't wanna die for nothing.<br />The CODA shown on page 85 is 15 measures long.  It has enough chords, notes (for piano and voice(all rests in the CODA) ) and the bass guitar line if a piano isn't playing that part.  The Outro is labeled, seven measures before the end, so accomplished musicians will all manage to end at the same time after they have run through it once or twice.  Anyone who has never done this should try it.erse directions include the strumming pattern for the second guitar, which plays the chords shown at the top of the page.

This play is an emotional experience that jumps back and forth over five years in the lives of four people.  Mathematics is the field within which individual creative activity is sought, but the interesting question about thought at such a high level is how anyone could establish authorship of anything that is authentically new if the circumstances allow some ambiguity.  The big joke in the play is about a young mathematician who is drummer in a rock band that performs an imaginary number.  It helps if the viewer is familiar with the movie &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; as the young mathematician-rock-drummer would be an ideal imaginary character if this play was about John Nash, as seeing people in that movie was not always proof that they existed.  The real question that hangs over the future in this play is how crazy anyone is likely to be in the short run and the long run, or if they can muddle through the emotional times without too much of some of the worst alcoholic beverages ever to be mentioned on a stage anywhere.	2004-02-18

Robin George Collingwood (1889-1943) took a year leave of absence on medical grounds from the University of Oxford, produced a first draft of this book during a voyage from England to Java, and explained the purpose of this book in a Preface dated 2 April 1939.  Early in the book, he backs up his views with the ideas about metaphysics of Berkeley, Hume, Kant and Hegel.  Chapter 3, Metaphysics without Ontology, proposes that &quot;Ontology will be my name for a mistake which people have made, Aristotle first and foremost, about metaphysics.&quot;  Nietzsche and Heidegger are not discussed in this book.  To the extent that particular individuals have been gripped by philosophical questions, their thinking is not considered important in the way in which it was important to them personally, but only insofar as their thinking was capable of producing a natural science.<br />Chapter 5, The Science of Absolute Presuppositions, must be understood as a product of Definition 6 in Chapter 4, &quot;An absolute presupposition is one which stands, relatively to all questions to which it is related, as a presupposition, never as an answer.&quot;  This might work perfectly in fields like mathematics, in which consensus is easy to arrive at among people who have some skill at sticking to a particular method, but it runs headlong into confusion when it is explained with &quot;Prop. 5.  Absolute presuppositions are not propositions.&quot;  This approaches the level of obscurity with which Richard Rorty discusses pragmatism when Collingwood points out the distinction, &quot;the logical efficacy of an absolute presupposition is independent of its being true:  it is that the distinction between truth and falsehood does not apply to absolute presuppositions at all, that distinction being (see def. 1) peculiar to propositions.&quot;<br />Chapter 6, &quot;Metaphysics An Historical Science&quot; makes clear that the form of science determines what is considered a cause.<br />&quot;(a)  In Newtonian physics . . . Events not due to the operation of causes are supposed to be due to the operation of laws.&quot;<br />&quot;(b)  . . . The peculiarity of Kantian physics is that it uses the notion of cause and the notion of law, one might almost say, interchangeably :  it regards all laws of nature as laws according to which causes in nature operate, and all causes in nature as operating according to law.&quot;<br />&quot;(c)  In modern physics the notion of cause has disappeared.  Nothing happens according to causes; everything happens according to laws.&quot;<br />Metaphysics can note such changes in the history of science by maintaining, &quot;It is a mistake, therefore, to fancy that by investigating the truth of their absolute presuppositions a metaphysician could show that one school of science was fundamentally right and another fundamentally wrong.&quot;  By sticking to history to evaluate metaphysical propositions, we can allow for the possibility &quot;These are historical questions.&quot;  Those who lack historical consciousness are more likely to &quot;present a piece of purely historical research as if it were a research into the universal nature of understanding.  But their mistaking it for something else does not alter the fact that it is history.&quot;<br />Part II of this book is called &quot;Anti-Metaphysics,&quot; beginning with Chapter 8, &quot;What Anti-Metaphysics Is.&quot;  Since the world is constantly changing, the three major categories are &quot;1.  Progressive Anti-Metaphysics.&quot;  &quot;2.  Reactionary Anti-Metaphysics.&quot; and a more complex case, &quot;3.  Irrationalist Anti-Metaphysics.&quot;  After explaining the progressive and reactionary cases, we get Chapter 9, &quot;Psychology as Anti-Metaphysics.&quot;  Here is another science which tells us how we think.  This gets us to Chapter 10, &quot;Psychology as the Science of Feeling&quot; and Chapter 11, &quot;Psychology as the Pseudo-Science of Thought.&quot;  At the cutting edge of critical thought, Collingwood cast a glance at a few contemporaries.  &quot;To plead that a criticism of TOTEM AND TABOO does not touch Freud's real position is to say that his views on religion, magic, and civilization are not grounded in his work as a scientist but are the mere opinions of a man whose reputation as a scientist has won for them a consideration they do not deserve.&quot;<br />Chapter 13, &quot;The Propaganda of Irrationalism&quot; expresses concern for civilization, religion, politics, education, social structure, and economic life.  In a world in which common ideas depend mostly upon &quot;the status of psychology as the pseudo-science of thought which claims to usurp the field of logic and ethics in all their various branches, including political science, aesthetics, economics, and whatever other criteriological sciences there may be,&quot; Collingwood suspects &quot;it is an attempt to discredit the very idea of science.&quot;  More complicated philosophical considerations crop up in Chapter 14, &quot;Positivistic Metaphysics.&quot;  This is getting close to the middle of this book.<br />Part III consists of examples.  Chapters 18 through 21 consider &quot;The Existence of God.&quot;  Chapters 22 through 28 explain &quot;The Metaphysics of Kant.&quot;  Chapters 29 to 33, on causation, conclude with &quot;Causation in Kantian Philosophy.&quot;  Chapter 34, the &quot;Epilogue,&quot; considers the views of other professors, Cook Wilson, H. A. Prichard, J. M. Keynes, John Wisdom, and A. J. Ayer, who &quot;are a group of neo-Kantians whose reverence for the master has induced them to accept&quot; what is now dubious.  &quot;To quote the bitter words of Earl Russell:  `The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm'.&quot;  I am not aware of the historical event pictured at the end of this book:<br />&quot;When Rome was in danger, it was the cackling of the sacred geese that saved the Capitol.

Colaiaco.  It has the Notes, Selected Bibliography, and Index of a scholarly work, and the last page of the Index shows more pages listed for Leo Strauss than for I. F. Stone.  There are even more entries in the Index for Friedrich Nietzsche than for Stone and Strauss, which shows an awareness of the larger philosophical questions involved.  All the information in this book is an outstanding background for understanding what Nietzsche was trying to explain in Section 340 of THE GAY SCIENCE, called, \\"The dying Socrates.\\"  Nietzsche was impressed by the last moment of Socrates' life.<br />`Whether it was death or the poison or piety or malice--something loosened his tongue at that moment and he said:  \\"O Crito, I owe Asclepius a rooster.\\" '<br />Colaiaco puts so much emphasis on \\"the moral claim that one's duty to obey God is superior to one's duty to obey the state\\"  (pp. 1-2) that the final words of Socrates must seem much more sarcastic after reading this book than for anyone who has merely shared I. F. Stone's interest in Athens as an origin of judicial process, democracy, and free speech.  I. F. Stone's THE TRIAL OF SOCRATES (1988) hardly mentions Nietzsche and Gregory Vlastos, but his knowledge of Greek language and culture provide an interesting political background for understanding Stone's imaginative chapters, \\"How Socrates Easily Might have Won Acquittal,\\" and \\"What Socrates Should Have Said.\\"<br />In fact, the trial put so much emphasis on Socrates' failure to observe the customs of ordinary Athenians, having his last words call for a sacrifice to the god of health might seem to be a continuation of the point Socrates was making in the conclusion of his argument at his trial.  \\"Surely, he presumes, unable to resist one final barb against his accusers, philosophers would not be executed for critical activity in the underworld.\\"  (Colaiaco, pp. 184-185).  Colaiaco accepts Socrates' willingness to participate in a death sentence as the ultimate triumph of philosophy over the judgments of this world, though his own acceptance of this judgment is hedged by the comment, \\"Significantly, he omits any mention of a possible encounter with Achilles, the Homeric warrior-hero whom he, as philosopher-hero, superseded.\\"  (p. 184).  On the scale of truth in philosophy and politics, this could be some indication of why modern politicians have so little expectation of being confronted by philosophers, as Hitler hardly ever heard anything from Martin Heidegger.al activity in the underworld.\\"  (Colaiaco, pp. 184-185).

Helms was uniquely qualified to see the big picture, having been a newspaper reporter who had lunch with Adolf Hitler (Chapter 2 is called `Lunch with Adolf') the day of a big rally in Nuremberg in 1936, a privilege that Americans willing to spend a thousand dollars a plate to attend a fundraiser with American presidents more recently might be jealous of, if being a millionaire is not enough to make them happy.  Henry Kissinger was happy to report in the Foreword that Helms was even invited to lunch with President Nixon after an early NSC meeting.  (p. xi).  There is even a picture of the famous Tuesday lunch group with LBJ, Rusk, Clark Clifford, General Wheeler, Walt Rostow, George Cushman and Walt Johnson.  There is even a picture of a lunch with Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush with the caption, \\"At lunch in the Vice President's office.  Aside from George Washington, the elder George Bush is the only President who had firsthand knowledge of the intelligence world.\\"<br />The Preface reports that February 2, 1973, was the day James Schlesinger was sworn in as head of CIA and Richard Helms lost the position which was his main claim to fame.  Richard Nixon had something to do with it, and Chapter 1, `A Smoking Gun' reports enough about the Watergate break-in to give the CIA perspective from the top, and ends with \\"Five months later, and a few days after his reelection, President Nixon called me to Camp David.  It was the last time we spoke while he was in office.\\"  (p. 13).  The Preface even claims \\"President Nixon had ended my intelligence career with a handshake at Camp David.\\"  (p. vi).  If Helms is right about that, there was no personal contact between the Director of the CIA and the President of the United States in December 1972 and January 1973, when the Vietnam ceasefire was being hammered into place and a record number of B-52 bombers were being shot down by North Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns and SAMs.  That figures.<br />The German spies are most fascinating in the beginning of the book.  Helms calls Martha Dodd an American, as she was the daughter of the American ambassador to Germany from 1933 to 1938, but she was also girlfriend of Boris Vinogradov, the press secretary at the Soviet embassy in Berlin.  After being charged with spying in 1957, she fled to Czechoslovakia.  \\"Martha was seventy when she died in Prague in 1990.\\"  (p. 20).  Spies and Richard Nixon have an acute sense of which side someone is on, and Helms seems to be particularly sensitive to the issues that Nixon would be prone to notice.  Other major personalities are easy to locate in the index:  Allen Dulles, James Angleton, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko, and Frank Wisner.<br />Chapter 8, \\"The Gehlen Organization,\\" deals with the group most responsible for allowing German intelligence after World War Two to maintain some continuity with the information that had been accumulating while Hitler was in power.  As the only employer in West Germany that was not averse to employing the upper echelons of the previous regime, it had no trouble recruiting four thousand former Nazis, but Helms did not find them reliable.  \\" . . . the American officers working with Gehlen in Washington neglected to insist upon being given the names of and biographical data on the RUSTY staff personnel. . . . Even in the confusion of the immediate post-war intelligence picture, this oversight violated one of the fundamental rules of secret intelligence, and helped to set the stage for the security disasters that in time all but destroyed the entire effort.\\"  (p. 86).  A lot of people have been jumping to this conclusion without having the kind of in-depth knowledge of the situation which Helms observed.<br />On \\"fundamental rules of secret intelligence,\\" (p. 86), Helms seems most upset that he received a felony conviction for denying something in testimony to Congress that he felt compelled to deny.  Helms was bitter that in his confirmation hearings to be appointed ambassador to Iran, he was asked questions by people who knew that the answer was officially secret, so he was being forced to lie to maintain a cover story that was maintaining dubious deniability.  This is the area of books on intelligence that I find most interesting.  Nosenko was not allowed to participate in a free debate in America over the nature of KGB activities regarding Lee Harvey Oswald because the entire nature of the KGB was a matter of exclusive CIA jurisdiction within the American system, and holding Nosenko a prisoner for years was the perfect symbol of the amount of control that the CIA believed it was entitled to maintain over such information.  Convicting Helms of a felony for lying to Congress was a matter of attempting to establish the principle that laws have a higher function than rules, and any individual within the American system is subject to the possibility of being hauled into court to be a patsy for whatever law the administration of justice intends to glorify in its present incarnation.<br />Helms doesn't exactly vilify Richard M. Nixon in this book, but just honestly stating \\"It has long been clear to me that President Nixon himself called the shots in the Watergate cover-up,\\" (p. 13) is damn close.  On our most recent impeachment, I think the movie \\"Candy\\" (1969, DVD 2001) with Enrico Maria Salerno as Jonathan J. John provides a better joke, when the police ask, \\"Did you see what happened to the girl in the blue dress?\\"  Film buff J.J.J. responded, \\"I don't know.  Who directed it?\\"  That is the way most Presidents feel about the CIA..<br />On \\"fundamental rules of secret intelligence,\\" (p. 86), Helms seems most upset that he received a felony conviction for denying something in testimony to Congress that he felt compelled to deny.

The Introduction by Richard Rhodes asserts that only two of the bombs shown on the cover of this book could &quot;encapsulate as much destructive force as all the explosives used in the Second World War.  World War II was a mere two-megaton war.&quot;  (p. 3).  I have heard how much noise a load of conventional bombs dropped by a B-52 makes landing in some mountains a few miles away, and it is easy to believe that since March 1949, the U.S. Strategic Air Command has had the power to destroy targets &quot;in and around seventy Soviet cities (and, collaterally, the cities themselves along with several million Soviet civilians) within thirty days with only 133 atomic bombs&quot; (p. 3), and those bombs were only atomic.<br />This book would have been impossible a hundred years ago:  no such weapons.  This book was impossible twenty years ago:  in 1984, big brother would not allow anyone who did not have the need to know so much precise knowledge of what was going on.  These pictures are proof, but such evidence is still subject to the height of absurdity, if anything can compare with one's own dubious experiences after imagining what this all cost:  &quot;The deafening roar brought to mind an image of a giant waterfall, with a wide, endless river of dollar bills cascading into a void&quot; (p. xiii) in the Prologue, but logic is subject to worse reasoning when the photographer was accused &quot;of having fabricated my earlier warhead photos.  A public affairs officer said that it was impossible that they would ever have given such permission, and that the photos I was showing them must be fakes&quot;  (p. xvii).  The military is largely a public institution, full of people who are quite capable of normal behavior, including a few deviations from normal conditions of secrecy when the rest of the world is expected to be entirely cowed by America's immense arsenal.<br />Paul Shambroom admits that he is not likely to get more pictures like these after September 11, 2001, but military authorities were still willing to help with information for the notes on pages 111-116, which include long-range plans, such as  &quot;The B-2 is expected to remain in service until 2040.&quot;  (p. 116).  The note for plate 78 also reveals that we have a fleet of 21 B-2 Spirit &quot;Stealth&quot; bombers that cost &quot;considerably more than 2 billion dollars for each plane.&quot;  (p. 115).  There are not many people in the pictures, and the people are not posed, so working with an elbow and chin up in the Trident II D5 submarine missile nose assembly must be the standard procedure at the Naval Submarine Base King's Bay, Georgia, as shown in Plate 42.  Reaching way inside a missile in a truck is a technician in Plate 33.  Plate 2 shows a chair for the Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall on December 17, 1993, when the first operational B-2 was delivered, but there are only a few women pictured in the entire book.  Plate 20 shows a woman serving a twenty-four-hour &quot;alert&quot; at an underground Launch Control Center in Newell, South Dakota.  Plate 71 might show a woman, if the wind in the Marshall Islands is ruffling her hair and making Bermuda shorts balloon out so they look like a skirt.

Hegel: Theologian of the Spirit (Making of Modern Theology)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Seriously done, but mainly philosophical	I should refrain from saying anything about who, if anyone might, would be adhering to the wrong religious doctrines in our own times.  Though the legacy of Hegel after his death is controversial, this book allows us to consider him &quot;a philosopher of religion&quot;  (p. 1), for whom &quot;the proper object of theology is religion itself, the relationship.&quot;  (p. 32).  With his knowledge of philosophy, Hegel was able to break religion down into four stages, in which the Greek religion based on art was considered the second stage.  Political superpower ideology seems to follow this as the Roman stage followed the height of Greek civilization.<br />&quot;The time of grief came when the Romans smashed the living individualities of the peoples, putting their spirits to flight and destroying their ethical life, before extending the universality of their lordship over the dismembered singular parts.  At the time of this dismembering for which there was no reconciliation, and of this universality that had no life--in this boredom of the world when peace was lord over all the civilized earth--the original identity had to rise out of its rent condition, it had to lift its eternal force above its grief and come again to its own intuition.  Otherwise the human race must have perished inwardly.&quot;  (p. 88).<br />I was most impressed by the connection between humor and legal oppression that arises in this situation, as if Hegel was also aware that comedy and law play to the same audience.<br />&quot;The latter [the Stoic autonomy of thinking, which passes through the movement of the skeptical consciousness to find its truth in that shape which we have called the unhappy self-consciousness] knows what the validity of the abstract person amounts to in actuality and equally in pure thought.  It knows that such validity is rather a complete loss; it is itself the conscious loss of itself and the divestment of knowledge from itself.  We see that this unhappy consciousness constitutes the counterpart and completion of the comic consciousness that is perfectly happy in itself.  Into the latter all divine being returns--the complete divestment of substance.  The unhappy consciousness, on the other hand, is conversely the tragic fate of the certainty of self that aims to be in and for itself.  It is the consciousness of the loss of all essentiality in this certainty of itself, and of the loss of even this knowledge of itself--the loss of substance as well as of self.  It is the anguish that finds expression in the harsh words, God is dead.&quot;  (p. 117)<br />&quot;Under the [Roman] legal status, then, the ethical world [of the Greeks] and the religion of that world are submerged in the comic consciousness, and the unhappy consciousness is the knowledge of this total loss.  It has lost the worth it attached to its personality both as immediate and as mediated or thought.  Trust in the eternal laws of the gods is silenced, just as the oracles, which pronounced on particular questions, are dumb.  The statues are now only stones from which the living souls have flown, just as are words from which faith is gone.&quot;  (pp. 117-118).<br />A portion of Hegel's famous Preface to his Phenomenology of Spirit is included in this book, in which he treats the word &quot;God&quot; as if being the subject of a sentence is the only proper use of the word:<br />&quot;The need to represent the absolute as subject has found expression in the propositions:  God is the eternal, the moral world-order, love, and so on.  In such propositions the true is just baldly posited as subject, but it is not presented as the movement of reflecting itself into itself.  In a proposition of this kind one begins with the word God.  Of itself, this is a meaningless sound, a mere name; it is only the predicate that says what God is, and gives God content and meaning; only when we get to the end of the proposition does the empty beginning become actual knowledge.  This beingso, it is not clear why one does not speak solely of the eternal, the moral world-order, and so on, as the ancients did, of pure concepts, of being, the One and so on, of what is the meaning, without adding the meaningless sound as well.  But it is just this word that indicates that what is posited is not a being or essence or universal in general, but something reflected into itself, a subject.&quot;  (pp. 95-96).<br />This book might be worthwhile for anyone who needs to brush up on how Hegel thinks about reflection.  In July 1802, `The Critical Journal of Philosophy' published Hegel's FAITH AND KNOWLEDGE, in which Hegel criticized the philosophies of Kant, Jacobi, and Fichte.  The Introduction of that work is called The Culture of Reflection (pp. 73-82) in this book, and reveals Hegel's awareness of the deepest thinkers of his own time:<br />&quot;Of course, the inner must be externalized; intention must become effective in action; immediate religious sentiment must be expressed in external gestures; and faith, though it flees from the objectivity of cognition, must become objective to itself in thought, concepts, and words.&quot;  (p. 75).<br />&quot;If an artist cannot give truth to what actually exists . . .&quot; (p. 81) &quot;then he will take refuge in feeling, in yearning and sentimentality as his remedy against actuality, spreading tears on the cheeks of the vulgar and bringing an `Oh Lord' to their lips.  Thus his figures will indeed look away beyond the actual situation toward heaven, but they will do so like bats that are neither bird nor beast, and belong neither to earth nor to sky.&quot;  (p. 82).<br />Near the end of the book, Hegel's lectures on religion include the story of Adam, Eve, the tree of knowledge, and &quot;Moreover, the serpent says that by eating the fruit of the tree Adam and Eve will become like God, and this appeals to human pride.&quot;  (p. 234).  Indeed.so, it is not clear why one does not speak solely of the eternal, the moral world-order, and so on, as the ancients did, of pure concepts, of being, the One and so on, of what is the meaning, without adding the meaningless sound as well.  But it is just this word that indicates that what is posited is not a being or essence or universal in general, but something reflected into itself, a subject.&quot;  (pp. 95-96).<br />This book might be worthwhile for anyone who needs to brush up on how Hegel thinks about reflection.

This book has no index, but there is very little in these lectures that an index could pick out as an adequate description of any of the topics covered in the book.  Pages 375-376 have a glossary, with some complicated words and phrases like &quot;time as it drags,&quot; but with no attempt to locate where to find such topics in the text of these lectures from 1929/30.  The Glossary is a guide to the translation, and people who have a favorite German word can check for the English word that is a most likely translation.  You are more likely to think there are some totally unlikely translations, if you only speak English, like &quot;resolute disclosedness:  Entschlossenheit.&quot;<br />Martin Heidegger is great, and you can't understand how he is great unless you comprehend the major problem in this book:  boredom.  Page 112 is devoted to smoking a cigar, and it is not just any cigar.  Smoking is studied as a social activity in which he watches himself taking part in a ritual that eventually leaves him empty because his entire life depends on what he thinks, and certainly &quot;not of viewing it in terms of isolated incidents, but of understanding it in the context of the whole situation of the evening, of sitting together, of making conversation.&quot;  (p. 111).  The social casualness is in sharp contrast with his desire for some enthusiasm for himself.<br />&quot;It--one's own self that has been left standing, the self that everyone himself or herself is, and each with this particular history, of this particular standing and age, with this name and vocation and fate; the self, one's own beloved ego of which we say that I myself, you yourself, we ourselves are bored.&quot;  (p. 134).<br />People who find Heidegger thrilling might find it interesting that there is very little information about other philosophers in THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF METAPHYSICS:  WORLD, FINITUDE, SOLITUDE, Translated by William McNeill and Nicholas Walker.  At the beginning, &quot;In Memory of Eugen Fink&quot; by Martin Heidegger, 26 July 1975, pictures Fink at this course listening &quot;with thoughtful reticence&quot; and later &quot;repeatedly expressed the wish that this lecture should be published before all others.&quot;  (p. v).  Philosophers mentioned in the text only get a few lines.  Novalis has his name in the title of section 2 on page 4, but he only gets quoted for eleven words:  &quot;Philosophy is really homesickness, an urge to be at home everywhere.&quot;  (p. 5)  Then Aristotle gets quoted with three Greek words that seem to mean &quot;Poets tell many a lie?&quot;  (p. 5).<br />When Heidegger gets to God on page 19, it just seems to be trouble.  &quot;Then philosophy too would have become utterly superfluous, and especially our discussion about it.  For God does not philosophize, if indeed (as the name already says) philosophy, this love of . . . as homesickness for . . ., must maintain itself in nothingness, in finitude.  Philosophy is the opposite of all comfort and assurance.&quot;  Heidegger opposes Descartes and theology since &quot;It, and with it all philosophizing of the modern era since Descartes, puts nothing at all at stake.&quot;  (p. 20).  Heraclitus is praised as a sign that &quot;The philosophers of antiquity already knew this and had to know it in their first decisive commencements.&quot;  (p. 22).  Plato gets credit for the distinction &quot;between being awake and sleeping.  The non-philosophizing human being, including the scientific human being, does indeed exist, but he or she is asleep.&quot;  (p. 23).  &quot;Hegel (to name a philosopher of the modern era)&quot; is mentioned without a quotation or even a footnote, &quot;but merely as an indication that I am not inventing a concept of philosophy here, nor arbitrarily presenting you with some private opinion.&quot;  (p. 23).<br />Chapter Three of the Preliminary Appraisal, justifying the inclusion&quot;of Comprehensive Questioning Concerning World, Finitude, Individuation as Metaphysics&quot; (p. 24) is back to the basic views about philosophy of the Greeks.  Heraclitus and Aristotle are considered &quot;by way of an elementary interpretation of the concept of truth in antiquity.&quot;  (p. 30).  Books were not published by big printing firms, like they are now, especially after &quot;Aristotle died around 322-21 B.C.&quot;  (p. 35).  The Aristotelian treatises were not collected for study until the first century B.C., long after Plato and Xenocrates established the main topics as disciplines:  logic, physics, ethics.  (p. 36).  Many of Aristotle's treatises did not belong within those topics, and Heidegger calls them &quot;Aristotle's philosophy proper.&quot;  (p. 37).  But there have been many approaches since then.<br />&quot;Through Christian dogma, ancient philosophy was forced into a quite specific conception which maintained itself throughout the Renaissance, Humanism and German Idealism, and whose untruth we are slowly beginning to comprehend today.  The first to do so was perhaps Nietzsche.&quot;  (p. 42).<br />With so few philosophers being mentioned, I was surprised to find in section 14 &quot;The concept of metaphysics in Franz Suarez and the fundamental character of modern metaphysics.&quot;  (pp. 51-55).  Considering Kant and Aquinas not as important as the questions raised by this Spanish Jesuit in the 16th century, &quot;who must be placed even above Aquinas in terms of his acumen and independence of questioning.&quot;  (p. 51).  While &quot;Suarez sides very positively with Thomas Aquinas&quot; (p. 53), &quot;it was precisely Kant who placed the possibility of metaphysics in doubt.&quot;  (p. 54).  Bouncing back to reality, &quot;We see most clearly at the place where modern philosophy explicitly begins, in Descartes, but especially in Fichte.&quot;  (p. 55).  The Preliminary Appraisal ends with section 15, in which the possibility of &quot;being gripped by a metaphysical question&quot; (pp. 56-57) sustains the book.  The shift to Part One is called &quot;Awakening a Fundamental Attunement in Our Philosophizing.&quot;  (p. 59).  The contemporary situation with the opposition of life (soul) and spirit in four philosophers leads to &quot;All four interpretations are only possible given a particular reception of Nietzsche's philosophy.&quot;  (p. 71).&quot;of Comprehensive Questioning Concerning World, Finitude, Individuation as Metaphysics&quot; (p. 24) is back to the basic views about philosophy of the Greeks.

US	44184384	R5X6PBQM6K5M7	0304706353	331406411	Dictionary of Semiotics	Books	4	1	2	N	N	College level material	I have been trying to find ideas that might be useful within the DICTIONARY OF SEMIOTICS by Bronwen Martin and Felizitas Ringham.  This dictionary is intellectual enough to have a Bibliography and an index, and could direct you to other books that would be helpful, but the first seven items in the Bibliography appear to be in French.  People who speak French might know what to expect in this dictionary if they already know the meaning of L'Espace, Semantique structurale, semio-linquistique, and semiotique.  People whose literary experiences have been in English will want to have a knowledge of fairy tales or action type movies which fall into the &quot;Canonical narrative scheme&quot; (p. 32) plot structure for understanding what is being discussed in most of the definitions of this book.<br />An application, &quot;A Semiotic Analysis of Sleeping Beauty&quot; (pp. 143-167) is provided for those who need to see an example of the form of discourse that semiotics produces in practice.  In a world in which entertainment seems to be the most commercially successful form of communication, an intellectual field like semiotics may provide intellectuals with a framework in which they can attempt to understand the significance of actions which might otherwise seem as mind-numbing as hours of video games.  I have not been spending much time on video games lately, but I had a tendency to play games that simulated activities on an assembly line or playing field that continued to proceed smoothly as long as the game player could keep pace with whatever was on the screen.  The &quot;Semiotic square&quot; (pp. 116-118) attempts to diagram forms of opposition in a way that produces something more complicated than linear thought, and time within the story of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (slightly less than two and a half pages) is analyzed in a manner that identifies fifteen figurative isotopies from &quot;once&quot; to &quot;finally.&quot;  The DICTIONARY OF SEMIOTICS includes a description of semiotics in the entry for Metalanguage:  &quot;Semiotics itself is a metalanguage, in other words, the term refers to the language or concepts that define the manner meaning is produced.&quot;  (p. 83).<br />If suddenly activities like video games could replace communication, the need or use for semiotics would disappear.  Particularly in the field of editorial cartoons, the subtle switch from comic books or movies about invading Mars being replaced by video games based on a Martian invasion by earthlings seems to point the way to a future in which this might be the main thing.<br />If my reviews of books on philosophy have sometimes been a catastrophe, it could be because I have usually been more concerned with what this DICTIONARY OF SEMIOTICS defines as &quot;Epistemic modalities&quot; than with how much a normal reader might enjoy any particular book.  Within the field of epistemic concerns, &quot;the modalities connected involve certainty/uncertainty and probability/improbability.&quot;  (p. 59).  Some of our greatest doubts are about history and what came before, so it seems possible to me that at the time of the founding of Athens, and possibly until the fall of ancient Athens and the hemlock for Socrates, there was a civilization in India that was a matriarchy, or which had displaced matriarchal societies to marginal areas which did not attempt to support large populations.  This civilization could have had great cities that were destroyed by invaders who lived in huts and left no trace of the cities.  I spent a year of my life in huts, away from large cities, and a number of Americans are still taking part in that kind of activity.  September 11 was an event involving the destruction of buildings, and the American reaction has taken a form that seems to rely on video game reflexes far more than on epistemic modalities.<br />&quot;In semiotic terms, epistemic modalities form part of the competence needed by an enunciatee to evaluate a proposition.  In order to establish an enunciative contract (implicit or explicit), an enunciator attempts to persuade (faire croire) the enunciatee, who, for his/her part, seals his/her own interpretative doing with an epistemic judgement, that is, with either believing (croire) the enunciator or doubting (ne pas croire) his/her statements.&quot;  (p. 59).<br />This book was published in 2000, but problems in stories correspond to the means used to evaluate where history is taking us.<br />&quot;The epistemic judgement in this instance refers to the assessment of the narrative subject's performance being in accordance with the initial contract.  It also relates to cognitive sanction in that it distributes belief or disbelief in statements made within a narrative. . . . Scientific discourse in particular is characterized by a surfeit of epistemic modalization which appears to take the place of verifying procedures.  The same goes for the experimental sciences and all discourse whose hypotheses are difficult to verify.&quot;  (p. 60).<br />In this book, politics does not appear in the index or as an entry in the main text, but it would fall between &quot;Poetic or aesthetic function&quot; (pp. 102-103) and Polysemy&quot; (p. 103).  Close enough for government work is:<br />&quot;The word `head' is polysemic, as it would appear in the dictionary as (a) a part of the body or (b) a leader, as in `Head of State'.&quot;  (p. 103)..

I have tried to explain the nature of this endowment in those few pages entitled &quot;Der Feldweg&quot; which first appeared in 1949 in a book honoring the hundredth anniversary of the death of Conradin Kreutzer.&quot;  (p. 43).<br />The Memorial Address is rather short, but it is followed by &quot;Conversation on a Country Path About Thinking&quot; (pp. 58-90) and a Glossary (pp. 91-93) which &quot;includes only those words especially important to the argument which are translated in more or less unusual ways,&quot; including &quot;Feldweg,&quot; which means &quot;country path.&quot;  One of the translators, John M. Anderson, also provides an Introduction to explain the differences in outlook of calculative thinking and meditative thinking.  The explanation includes a description of BEING AND TIME (pp. 15-18, 20-21), INTRODUCTION TO METAPHYSICS (pp. 18-19), and the special terms used in this book.<br />The Memorial Address is the simple part of this book, clearly aimed at &quot;Honored Guests, Friends and Neighbors!&quot;  (p. 43).  Instead of dwelling on music as the creation of those who seek to express their forms of meditation in notes that others can participate in, Heidegger names the forms through which spectators merely look and listen:  &quot;chained to radio and television.  Week after week the movies carry them off . . .  Picture magazines are available everywhere.&quot;  (p. 48).  Calculative thinking produces a habit seen by Heidegger as &quot;the superficiality of man's way of life.&quot;  (p. 49).  Speaking just three weeks before a Soviet test of a thermonuclear device dropped from an airplane on November 22, 1955, Heidegger said, &quot;Far more uncanny is our being unprepared for this transformation, our inability to confront meditatively what is really dawning in this new age.&quot;  (p. 52).<br />The attitude which Heidegger recommended to people at large reminds me of my own involvement in what I consider secret circus stunts.  &quot;But suddenly and unaware we find ourselves so firmly shackled to these technological devices that we fall into bondage to them.&quot;  (pp. 53-54).  By just observing, &quot;we stand at once within the realm of that which hides itself from us, and hides itself just in approaching us.  That which shows itself and at the same time withdraws is the essential trait of what we call mystery.&quot;  (p. 56).  Meditation is called for as a more human activity, and the composer is finally brought back to our attention.  &quot;If we respond to the prompting, we think of Conradin Kreutzer by thinking of the origins of his work, the life-giving powers of his Heuberg homeland.  And it is we who think if we know ourselves here and now as the men who must find and prepare the way into the atomic age, through it and out of it.&quot;  (p. 56).<br />The Conversation on a Country Path About Thinking has three participants:  Scientist, Teacher, and Scholar.  The scientist is eager to learn whatever might be useful, or what &quot;is said to shelter in itself the nature of thinking, whereas things themselves do not think.&quot;  (p. 76).  The Scholar is well aware of the views of Meister Eckhart and Kant, and can discuss non-willing in a manner that reminds me of aphoria and the forms of opposition related in the DICTIONARY OF SEMIOTICS to the semiotic squares used to illustrate its definitions of alethic modalities, being-able, believing-to-be, contradiction, deixis, having-to-do, illusion, life/death, modalities, secret, semiotic square, uncertainty, and veridiction.  In a semiotic analysis of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; page 161 of the DICTIONARY OF SEMIOTICS shows three semiotic squares used to illustrate the deep level by mapping the fundamental transformation between two poles of abstract meaning between which the text moves for each square.  Heidegger might be picturing himself in his Conversation as the teacher who can say:<br />&quot;Not only do I see this relation, I confess that ever since I have tried to reflect on what moves our conversation, it has claimed my attention, if not challenged me.&quot;  (p. 59).<br />We are all allowed to feel a bit lost, as the scientist says:<br />&quot;You say that the horizon is the openness which surrounds us.  But what is this openness as such, if we disregard that it can also appear as the horizon of our representing?&quot;  (p. 64).CS shows three semiotic squares used to illustrate the deep level by mapping the fundamental transformation between two poles of abstract meaning between which the text moves for each square.

US	44184384	RREBCVUGPPV7L	0521220963	873635300	004: The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes (Volume 4)	Books	5	6	10	N	N	Some great old ideas, including the famous long run	The Preface of Monetary Reform by John Maynard Keynes is dated October 1923, in a time when there were few economists.  As the Preface of this book states this dire aspect of the situation:<br />&quot;Nowhere do conservative notions consider themselves more in place than in currency ; yet nowhere is the need of innovation more urgent.  One is often warned that a scientific treatment of currency questions is impossible because the banking world is intellectually incapable of understanding its own problems.  If this is true, the order of Society, which they stand for, will decay.  But I do not believe it.  What we have lacked is a clear analysis of the real facts, . . .&quot;  (p. vi).<br />There are charts in this book to provide the facts which Keynes was concerned about.  Index Numbers of Wholesale Prices Expressed as a Percentage of 1913 on page 5 covers the years 1913 to 1923 (First half-year) for nine nations, looking most outstandingly bad for Germany, which has a final number of 765,000 for half of 1923, far larger than the maximum number of any other country.  Italy was at 624 in 1920 and declined to 577 in 1921, still higher than the 510 monthly average that France had in 1920.<br />A chart at the top of page 18 with dates from 1815 to 1922 is supposed to illustrate &quot;what a splendid investment gilt-edged stocks had been through the century from Waterloo to Mons, even if we omit altogether the abnormal values of 1896-97.  Our table shows how the epoch of Diamond Jubilee was the culminating moment in the prosperity of the British middle class.&quot;  (p. 18).  But for people who were concerned about the tumble taken after 1914, things were not so great.  &quot;The whole of the improvement of the nineteenth century had been obliterated,&quot; (I'm looking at an old edition, so my page numbers might be way off from whatever book you might be able to buy today).<br />The basic information that is most important to Society as a whole is contained in Chapter I, The Consequences To Society of Changes in the Value of Money, considering separately the interests of the Investing Class, the Business Class, and the Earner.  The power of any government which can produce money merely by printing it is considered in Chapter II, Public Finance and Changes in the Value of Money, particularly with respect to Inflation as a Method of Taxation.  In order to show that a government might have some choice in such matters, Keynes also considers &quot;Currency Depreciation versus Capital Levy.&quot;  If this seems like an odd topic now, Keynes is reassuring that such a move might only be considered &quot;when the State's contractual liabilities, fixed in terms of money, have reached an excessive proportion of the national income.&quot;  This might happen (sooner or later) to any country which stops producing anything except educational opportunities, medical bills, entertainment and banking, in years when a high national debt must be refinanced at high interest rates.<br />Chapter III gives us The Theory of Money and of the Foreign Exchanges.  Recently INFECTIOUS GREED by Frank Partnoy provided an example, early in his book, of how bankers still don't have any yardstick for figuring out how much they are making when Bankers Trust was trying to figure out how much profit it could declare on trading in the foreign-exchange markets by Andy Krieger in 1987.  Being able to bet the assets of a large bank on the direction that a currency would go in 1987 allowed Andy Krieger to get a job with George Soros in April, 1988, where turnabout became his main play.  &quot;Krieger reversed the position, and bet against the pound.  A single trade with Chemical Bank was for more than $1.8 billion.&quot;  (Portnoy, p. 33).  Really and truly, I think Partnoy blames Krieger for taking stable currencies and earning large bonuses by making them worth much less than they had been worth before he had the option to sell it at a given price.  Part IV. The Forward Market in Exchanges in Chapter III of Keynes's MONETARY REFORM attempts to state three practical conclusions.  First, hedging a risk won't work when the situation is so bad that there is &quot;a fear of a sudden implosion of exchange regulations or of a moratorium.&quot;  Partnoy seemed to think that the private trading in derivative contracts was where the big money was made, and public positions in an exchange could be fake positions hedging a bet in the opposite direction, but that there was no law against this kind of manipulation of the market for money.  Keynes was more interested in stability.  &quot;With free forward markets thus established no merchant need run an exchange risk unless he wishes to, and business might find a stable footing even in a fluctuating world.&quot;<br />Second, there must be money from speculators in such a market for the market to function.  &quot;The wide fluctuations . . . have been due, not to the presence of speculation, but to the absence of a sufficient volume of it relatively to the volume of trade.&quot;<br />Third, high interest rates don't matter as much &quot;unless the change in relative money-rates is comparable in magnitude (as it used to be but no longer is) with the possible range of exchange fluctuations.)&quot;  Possibly things have changed so much in the last 80 years that Keynes would phrase that differently today.<br />Chapter IV turns to &quot;the United States, which has enjoyed a gold standard throughout, has suffered as severely as many other countries,&quot; but not as badly as Germany and Austria back then.arket in Exchanges in Chapter III of Keynes's MONETARY REFORM attempts to state three practical conclusions.

It was not posted, and attempting to read that conglomeration of insights on the complexity of the arguments in this book now does not encourage me.  Just a few strands in the book coincided with my normal states of perplexity, and the only sense that tied them together was a common triumph of humor over interest:  we know different jokes, but the joke we know is not the best part of how we are able to evaluate new situations.  There is a tremendous tension in this book between having a paradigm and being able to exercise mental control in a way that leads to intellectual servitude.  The concern with science is the tip of the iceberg, like neology was the key for understanding Lenny Bruce for anyone who did not want to think any further than the words he could pile on once he got started.<br />When theology exercised control over education, it determined what was taught in a way that expanded its own importance.  David Friedrich Strauss wrote his major work about myths included in Bible accounts of the life of Jesus in about 1835, showing how real thinkers were unimpressed by the form of miraculous persuasion it had attempted to impose.  Steve Fuller, in this book, mentions David Friedrich Strauss as an example of a thinker who became too sarcastic to be included within the scholarly factions of his day.  With a pension, David Friedrich Strauss was able to write instead of teach, becoming as popular as any serious theologian of his time and able to pursue the content of popular opinion.<br />Social science has become such a group activity that the greatest relief in this book is when Thomas Kuhn has an opportunity to address what social science is doing, but admits that he doesn't know enough to get started down that road, because he doesn't want to fake it.  Experts of their own ideas have their own jokes, and the rivalries between departments at major universities push different points of view to the point where absurdity is not out of place in a book of this nature, which ought to be a warning to you, somehow.<br />I rate this book highly because it exceeds my standards for getting into the thick of things on an intellectual level that is sure to remain challenging for as long as the reader attempts to figure out what it is saying.  Thomas Kuhn has become famous for having a philosophy of science that any intellectual can use to measure how successful the participants in the sociology of knowledge have been.  Expecting the future to be different from the past, as happens occasionally, this book challenges how precariously such judgments maintain the egoes of modern thinkers.  If the book seems a bit thick with names and ideas, that is not something that should stop serious readers and thinkers.where absurdity is not out of place in a book of this nature, which ought to be a warning to you, somehow.<br />I rate this book highly because it exceeds my standards for getting into the thick of things on an intellectual level that is sure to remain challenging for as long as the reader attempts to figure out what it is saying.

The same is true of my rendering *ousia* as \\"thinghood,\\" when it is used in a general sense, and as \\"an independent thing\\" when it is used of singulars.  I have heard two sorts or criticism of my use of the word thinghood in Aristotle's PHYSICS.  The one sort, that it occasions laughter or embarrassment, is a general instance of Heidegger's observation in WHAT IS A THING? that philosophy is that at which thoughtless people laugh.  Let the laughter or embarrassment subside, and then judge the meaning carried by the word, both on its own and in its context, on its merits.  The other sort of criticism regrets the fact that thinghood is not as closely related to being as *ousia* is to *to on.* . . .' (p. xxxvii).<br />\\"Lassie is an *ousia,* and the *ousia* of Lassie is dog.\\"  (p. xxxviii).<br />Intellectuals need to pay attention to the concepts that are used in their own fields, if nowhere else, and Aristotle was close to the peak of ancient Greek intellectual attainment.<br />\\"Aristotle invents a second word, being-at-work-staying-itself (entelecheia), converging with it in meaning, to sharpen and clarify his use of being-at-work, and he gives an array of examples in which we are meant to `see at a glance by means of analogy,' what it means (1048a 39).\\"  (p. xxxix).<br />In the beginning of this book, ARISTOTLE'S METAPHYSICS, Translated by Joe Sachs, there is a Greek Glossary with 49 words or phrases on three pages, followed by an English Glossary of 43 words or phrases on eleven pages.  \\"This is a slightly revised version of the glossary that appears with the translation of the PHYSICS, based upon those passages in which Aristotle explains and clarifies his own usage.  Bekker page numbers from 184 to 267 refer to the PHYSICS; those from 980 to 1093 are in the METAPHYSICS.\\"  (p. xlix).<br />Chapters are short, especially in Book V (Book Delta), which Joe Sachs calls \\"Things Meant in More than One Way.\\"  This has usually been considered \\"a dictionary, but Aristotle himself, at the beginnings of Books VII and X, says that it is about the various ways things are meant.  The point is not to define words but to collect and organize the distinct senses of important words meant in more than one way.  These ambiguities are not verbal but inherent in things, and Aristotle steadfastly preserves them.\\"  (p. 77, n. 1).<br />I am not particularly fond of this book.  If undergraduate college courses are meant to provide students with general outlook on likely events, and graduate schools at major universities are intended to select those students who want to qualify for cutting edge work in a highly specialized professional discipline, the works of Aristotle seem to be the high point of a Greek attempt to create an upper level above anything that had previously been considered possible.  Alexander the Great, as a student of Aristotle, might be faulted for aspiring to far more than what could be useful, just as Heidegger seemed to be pushing for a German spirit that was sure to damn the rest of the world to misery when he assumed a place in the leadership of a German university backing Hitler and the Nazi party.<br />I did not find Aristotle's approach to religion in Book VI to be inspiring, though it does seem to be intellectual.  \\"But if there is anything that is everlasting and motionless and separate, . . .<br />\\"And while it is necessary that all causes be everlasting, these are so most of all, since they are responsible for what appears to us of the divine.  Therefore there would be three sorts of contemplative philosophy, the mathematical, the natural, and the theological; for it is not hard to see that if the divine is present anywhere, it is present in anature of this kind, and that the most honorable study must be about the most honorable class of things.  The contemplative studies, then, are more worthy of choice than are the other kinds of knowledge, and this one is more worthy of choice than are the other contemplative studies.\\"  (pp. 110-111).<br />This is a nice priority for an established church to maintain its dignity, but it is far more ancient than modern.  It is not clear how infinite his \\"triangle containing two right angles\\" (p. 112) is supposed to be.  Even his attempts to tiptoe around the major stereotypes of ancient bookworms seem limp.  \\"For instance, it is neither always nor for the most part that someone pale has a refined education, but since it sometimes happens, it will be incidental (or if not, everything would be by necessity).\\"  (p. 113).<br />The Index only mentions three pages in Aristotle's text for Socrates, though Aristotle often uses his name as an example:  \\"And since Socrates exerted himself about ethical matters and not at all about the whole of nature,\\" (p. 14) and \\"so that whether Socrates is or is not, one might become like Socrates, and it is obvious that it would be the same even if Socrates were everlasting.\\"  (p. 23).  Two generations of seeking lessons from Socrates, ignoring whatever meaning the hemlock had, took place before we find Aristotle finally admitting \\"For there are two things one might justly credit Socrates with, arguments by example and universal definition,\\"  (p. 260).  A real philosopher ought to do better than that.nature of this kind, and that the most honorable study must be about the most honorable class of things.

Paul mentioned God a lot in his letters.  &quot;The word `God' itself occurs 548 times in the Pauline corpus, 153 in Romans alone.&quot;  (p. 28).  Intellectually, the idea of God takes the most significance in theology, carried on still by those who follow in Paul's footsteps, with a humility emphasized in &quot;the concluding doxology early on added to Romans:  `to God, only, wise.' (Rom. 16.25).&quot;  (p. 32).<br />I rarely have any enthusiasm for religion as a church activity, particularly when it stifles humor as an instinctive defense of church ideas against the outright display of entertainment values, but intellectual study about religious doctrines is likely to be enlightening, even in such religious settings, where over-intellectualizing is likely to be condemned for its over-their-heads qualities but is sometimes tolerated in small quantities.  As an apostle, Paul made some striking attempts to expound on a new form of freedom, possibly in a way that is ironic in Philemon 13: &quot;while I am in the chains that the Good News has brought me,&quot; but sure that something good would result, as in Philemon 21:  &quot;I am writing with complete confidence that you will do even more than I ask.&quot;  With such faith, it is not surprising that those associated with the church have maintained the ability to write, even at great length, as in THE THEOLOGY OF PAUL THE APOSTLE by James D. G. Dunn.<br />Certain philosophical and theological disputes have attempted to deal with the issues raised in Paul's letter to the Romans, and nine pages of the Index of Scripture and Other Ancient Writings (pp. 772-781) are required to locate all the mentions of its verses in this book.  Although Jesus is pictured in the Gospels as being tested in his conversations with Pharisees and Sadducees, Paul was the monumental thinker who provided doctrines for thinking that Christianity was a religion with its own justification on a deep theological level.  Dunn's awareness of this problem:  &quot;Paul himself, as Pharisaic Jew become apostle of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, embodied one of the most painful of these tensions within himself.  [See particularly section 19 below.]&quot;  (p. 19 [n. 54]) is indicated early in the book, in his discussion of the religious doctrines shared due to &quot;evidently shared knowledge of the Jewish scriptures, presumably in most cases in their Greek (LXX) form.&quot;  (pp. 15-16).<br />There is a short list in note 39 on page 13 of letters actually believed to be written by Paul, including Romans and Philemon, but stating &quot;the majority regard Ephesians and the Pastorals as definitely post-Pauline (I side with the majority).&quot;  Those who think Ephesians is particularly uptight in ways that modern Americans are not, or shouldn't be, or wouldn't be if we were a thoroughly comic society, will be glad that we can stop blaming Paul for some things that uptight early church dignitaries wanted to put in the Bible anyway.  Still, we are stuck with a lot of verses like &quot;he who refrains from marriage will do better.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 7:38).<br />The theology has a tremendous scope, even if humans are dealt with in anthropological presuppositions.  Paul helped put Adam on the theological map, along with sin, death, the law, Jesus, Christ crucified, justification by faith, Israel, the church, and &quot;the law of the Spirit.&quot;  I already mentioned section 19, where the conflict between an existing religious tradition glorifying Israel and Paul's proclamations are greatest.  In the book translated into English as RELIGION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF MERE REASON, Kant belittled the idea of a religion that consecrated an entire people.  Kant found Christianity to be superior in its morality because it attended to the individual motivations whichhe considered the basis for morality within his philosophy.  Paul seems to be the main Biblical basis for this emphasis on the individual, though Christ's parable about separating sheep from the goats is worthy of this interpretation.  Modern religion, as an intensely private interior aspect of individual existence, likely to be ridiculed if it is mentioned in connection with bloody conflicts, still holds a picture of God &quot;who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else?&quot;  (Rom. 8:32).  Paul had enough knowledge of the Greek Jewish scriptures to quote them on the normality of such conflicts.  &quot;As it is written, `For your sake we are being killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.'&quot;  (Rom. 8:36).  Dunn tries to explain why Paul showed such concern for the Israelites.<br />&quot;In our attempt to follow the course of Paul's own theologizing through Romans we have now reached ch. 9-11.  At this point we are bound to stop short and take stock.  For the function of Chs. 9-11 within Romans, and so also within Paul's theology, has always been a matter of some controversy.  Why did Paul turn so abruptly to express his concern for his `kinsmen in terms of the flesh' (9.3)?  He had reached such a wonderful climax of Christian assurance in 8.28-39.  Anything following that would inevitably appear as something of an anticlimax.  But why this sudden descent to depths of existential angst:  `I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit, that my grief is great and the anguish of my heart unceasing. . . .'

The Penland School of Crafts, located in the mountains of North Carolina, seems large enough to be considered a community.  \\"Today the school encompasses 43 buildings located on 400 acres of land.  Each year approximately 1,200 people come to Penland for instruction and another 12,000 pass through as visitors.\\"  (p. 205).  I expected to find more pictures in the book of the interesting three-dimensional conglomeration on the cover, which is probably not a bunch of bananas, but maybe the artist thought it was.  The colors are similar to the \\"Yellowstone Rhododendron, 2001\\" and \\"Mountain Magnolia, 2001\\" shown on page 53.  Even if it is supposed to be a bunch of bananas, that would not make it the most surreal thing in this book.<br />I have had difficulty thinking about objects that appear to be weird in three dimensions, so the complexity of many of the pieces seems miraculous to me, but the step-by-step explanations of the process of constructing a few items demonstrate the possibilities of getting there bit by bit.  The first artist featured in the book, Clara \\"Kitty\\" Couch, produces terra cotta vessels that open out at the top with an edge so thin, looking so flimsy, that the first picture in the hands on series, \\"Rolling out the slab\\" (p. 17), showing the clay under a rolling pin, ought to produce an immense leap in the understanding of how the material is originally flattened before it is formed.  There are also pictures of Joe Bova \\"Rolling out a 12-pound (5.4 kg) slab to a thickness of at least 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) on a piece of plywood\\" (p. 152) and Mary Barringer \\"applying texture with a tectured roller\\" (p.198).  A description of Kitty Couch's work is called \\"Contemplative Coilings\\" (p. 12), but she does not try to make it all from one long rope.  She describes adding flat coils, one at a time, \\"When the base has become firm so that it can support itself.\\"  (p. 13).  More complicated layers of clay were used to produce Becky Gray's \\"Autumn Leaf Bowl\\" shown on page 24.<br />The works which I found most imaginative were by Sergei Isupov on pages 168 to 185.  By painting faces at odd places, such as under the armpits of a figure called \\"To Cast a Spell\\" (pp. 168, 176 - 185 and back cover), the spooky line of Rilke's poem, \\"Archaic Torso of Apollo,\\" `there is no spot that does not see you' (Translated by Walter Kaufmann in 20 German Poets, pp. 220-223) seems aptly illustrated.<br />There are some specialized techniques and equipment in this book that I will not try to describe.

The copy I have of SILVERADO (1991), was published when the father of Neil Bush was President of the United States.  Whether anything further has come to light, I can't say, and this book did not know why Colorado's plan to close Silverado at the end of October, 1988, during the presidential election campaign, was delayed by a mystery phone call that resulted in fantastic losses before the official closing date of December 8 or 9, 1988.  &quot;On October 21, the Colorado savings and loan commissioner called Mowbray in Topeka and said he would close the thrift before the end of the month.  Mowbray, suddenly and unexpectedly, ordered the proceedings to a halt.  A call had come from Washington asking Mowbray to hold off closing Silverado for forty-five days.&quot;  (p. 183).<br />I do not see any logic for assuming that the bank had hundreds of millions of dollars more in September than in December of 1988, but this book says:<br />&quot;The cost of that delay is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  In late September, regulators estimated the cost of Silverado's closure to be between $400 million and $600 million.  When the thrift was finally closed December 9, it cost $1 billion.&quot;  (p. 184).<br />If anything irks me about this book, it is the journalistic sensationalism.  I like to look at the pictures (pp. 97-112) to see who the book captures and how young they looked in the 1980s.  In the first nine months of 1990, Neil Bush even allowed the author to have six interviews (p. 7), trying to convince the public, &quot;Silverado was no different than any other well-respected savings and loan, and I acted in prudence in all matters, just like any other respected director would in my position.&quot;  (p. 12).  That shouldn't surprise anyone who knows more about the role of money in politics than they know about the role of mathematics in financial transactions, but this book itself is not much higher up the intellectual food chain.  There is so little information that I will provide summary topics for each chapter:<br />Chapter 1:  Denver<br />Chapter 2:  Michael Wise, the hypnotic new (in 1979) president of Mile High Savings.  &quot;Wise paid himself millions, but he never amassed the ridiculous icons of wealth that became hallmarks of some thrift executives' careers.&quot;  (p. 28).<br />Chapter 3:  &quot;The measly 5.5 percent savings and loans paid for deposits at the time was a joke.  No one in his or her right mind would keep money in a savings account that paid so little . . .&quot;  (p. 39).  &quot;Mile High was healthy in 1972, when interest rates were relatively stable.  That year, the nation's thrifts had a collective worth of $16.7 billion.  By 1980, that figure had crashed to a negative $17.5 billion.  Mile High, accordingly, was practically broke.&quot;  (p. 40).  &quot;The thrift doubled again the next year.&quot;  (p. 44).  &quot;Propelled by the commissions they got each time a big block of money moved, the brokers had pulled in 20 percent of Silverado's total deposit base by 1985.&quot;  (p. 51).<br />Chapter 4:  &quot;Neil came into the world on a wintry Texas day, January 22, 1955, the third son . . .&quot;  (p. 60).<br />Chapter 5:  &quot;As any number of late-night TV seminars will tell you, the secret to making a lot of money in the real estate business is not to use your own cash.&quot;  (p. 73).  &quot;So, under the approving eye of the Reagan administration, lawmakers passed the Economic Recovery Tax Act, another way of saying Big Tax Break.&quot;  (p. 74).  &quot;An investor could buy a share of a real estate project for $100,000 and get $200,000 in tax breaks.&quot;  (p. 75).<br />Chapter 6:  &quot;With Neil on the board, that's what Wise got.  In January 1986, just four months after Neil joined, vice chairman Vandapool wrote a memo to Wise (the samememo in which he praised Wise for transforming Silverado from a mess to a miracle).  `Let's admit it,' he wrote, `The Board is a legal necessity, but you and Jim (majority stockholder W. James Metz) control the company and you control the directors.'&quot;  (pp. 90-91).<br />Chapter 7:  &quot;By 1988, M.D.C., Silverado and Walters had donated nearly $1 million to candidates for governor, mayor, county commissioner and a spate of other local seats.  Thousands more went to national campaigns for Congress and the presidency.&quot;  (p. 134).<br />Chapter 8:  &quot;They believed Silverado was in bad shape, but they apparently didn't have any idea of the task on which they were about to embark.&quot;  (pp. 152-153).  &quot;There was no question:  The thrift was hemorrhaging, and it had to be stopped.&quot;  (p. 153).<br />Chapter 9:  &quot;A pig is a powerful and feared beast in the trade that symbolizes an audit out of control, paralyzed by confusion.&quot;  (p. 162).  &quot;Silverado's managers was furious.  How dare these pencil necks tell them how to run their business.&quot;  (p. 168).  &quot;The Silverado account was the pig of pigs.&quot;  (p. 172).  &quot;That such a frenzy of greed and irresponsibility should have occurred, of all places, in the accounting profession is mind-boggling.&quot;  (p. 173).<br />Chapter 10:  &quot;On June 8, 1988, the inevitable happened.  The Fort Worth real estate developer missed a $3 million dollar payment on a loan . . . According to the insane terms of the original agreement, Silverado was liable for the payment, and the developer wouldn't be paying Silverado for its $74 million loan.&quot;  (p. 177).  &quot;But it was clear that the thrift wasn't long for the world when on August 15 the Colorado savings and loan commissioner issued a capital call, the first step in a government takeover.  Two days later, suddenly sensitive to the appearance of conflicts of interest, Neil Bush announced his resignation from the board.&quot;  (p. 181).memo in which he praised Wise for transforming Silverado from a mess to a miracle).  `Let's admit it,' he wrote, `The Board is a legal necessity, but you and Jim (majority stockholder W.

The intellectual part played by the author seems to be like the \\"no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\\" in the song, \\"Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts\\" by Bob Dylan, the longest song on the \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" album, which has been extremely popular for years.  Situations are as different as the verses of that song, and Rosemary is not unusual when \\"she was with Big Jim but she was leaning toward the Jack of Hearts.\\"  Lily \\"had come away from a broken home with lots of strange affairs with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere, but she never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.\\"  The song is more tragic than this book.  The book is religious enough to adopt love as its ultimate standard.  Love can be a great motivator on a personal level, but the situations that it leads to in sex and warfare can be quite striking, like American troops breaking down doors in the middle of the night because they are trying to find people and weapons that are more dangerous than Hosea's wife.  I liked this book because it illustrated that sex might be considered useful in a lot of situations, which was not what I was experiencing in real life at the time.  Our society is due for some attitude adjustment on sex and love, and this book clearly thinks love is more important, but people who read it are more likely to be interested in the sex.  After you read it, you might know what Bob Dylan meant when he sang, \\"I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself.\\"	2004-01-08

G. Dunn, I noticed use of LXX as an abbreviation for Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testament possibly produced by 72 Jewish scholars in 72 days at the request of Egypt's King Ptolemy II (309-247? B.C.), which was the same abbreviation used by Kung in this book.  If this information was contained in this book, I missed it, and the review I wrote three months ago was obviously deficient in failing to grasp the source of a confusion that is less likely to arise when trying to read a thoroughly documented work which is extremely generous in its attempt to identify all its sources, as is the case in the scholarly summary of current issues in THE THEOLOGY OF PAUL THE APOSTLE by Dunn, which needed eight pages of Abbreviations to distinguish DJD (discoveries in the Judaean Desert) from DSS (Dead Sea scrolls), etc.  Dunn's book is generally so clear that it is easier to read than the review I wrote three months ago, if you want to know the truth.	2004-01-07

If you read the book first, then come to the first entry on page 340, &quot;already, always already, antecedent, before, beforehand, earlier, in advance, precedent, prior--expressions used with great frequency: . . .&quot; you know that dozens of pages can be cited for &quot;some characteristic instances: . . . &quot;  Longer entries provide more complete indexing for being, being-in-the-world, beings, Da, Dasein, exist, extant, horizon, interpretation, &quot;is&quot; (See copula), Kant, now, nows (nun), ontological, ontology, philosophy, problem, problems, problems, specific, projection, project, self, structure, subject, Temporal, Temporality, temporal, temporality (zeitlich . . .), temporalize (zeitigen), theses, thing, thingness, thinghood, thinking, time, transcend, truth, understand, understanding of being, unveil, and world.<br />Frankly, I am glad that I have previously attempted to read lectures and the Heraclitus seminars which used the Greek alphabet (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, etc.) for Greek words, so that I was warned that translation was necessary, and I learned enough Greek words to recognize that ancient language even when it is printed in transliterated form, with no indication that a foreign language is being used, as frequently occurs in this book.<br />&quot;In a corresponding passage Aristotle says that this `is' means a synthesis and is accordingly en sumploke dianoias kai pathos en taute, it is the coupling that the intellect produces as combining intellect, and this `is' means something that does not occur among things; it means a being, but a being that is, as it were, a state of thought.&quot;  (p. 182).<br />People with absolutely no knowledge of Greek might try reading the Lexicon entry for &quot;Greek expressions&quot; (pp. 358-359) before reading pages 73, 86, 115, etc. to remind themselves that when they read &quot;to on&quot; on page 53, they were reading Greek, as &quot;to ti en einai&quot; on page 85 is a bit more obviously not in English, as Aristotle was not.  How helpful is this?  Consider the final entry in Greek expressions:  zoe, 121.  Looking it up, I find in the final paragraph of section 12:<br />&quot;First, however, one problem makes its claim on our attention:  besides the extant (at-hand extantness) there are beings in the sense of the Dasein, who exists.  But this being which we ourselves are--was this not always already known, in philosophy and even in pre-philosophical knowledge?  Can one make such a fuss about stressing expressly the fact that besides the extant at-hand there is also this being that we ourselves are?  After all, every Dasein, insofar as it is, always already knows about itself and knows that it differs from other beings.  We ourselves said that for all its being oriented primarily to the extant at-hand, ancient ontology nevertheless is familiar with psuche, nous, logos, zoe, bios, soul, reason, life in the broadest sense.  Ofcourse.  But it should be borne in mind that the ontical, factual familiarity of a being does not after all guarantee a suitable interpretation of its being.&quot;  (pp. 120-121).<br />The actual lectures only consist of 22 sections, with &quot;The Being of the Copula&quot; in Chapter Four (pp. 177-224) primarily considered in sections 16 and 17, though the outline of the subject at the end of Heidegger's Introduction, section 6, suggested that this would be at the end of Part One, Chapter Four.  Section 18 on the existential mode of being of truth has also been included at the end of Chapter Four, where it seems to follow quite naturally.  Though it is only followed by Part Two, Chapter One, anyone who wishes to imagine more may adopt the idea stated by Heidegger on page 225 that Part Two would also have four chapters, in which we could encounter the basic problems again ending with &quot;fourthly, the problem of the truth-character of being.&quot;<br />There isn't anything about pandering in the Lexicon, but the 22 listings for &quot;copula&quot; might be close, considering the &quot;See `is' &quot; cross-reference and the amount of political scandal that has recently been generated by President Clinton when he was trying to think non-copulatively in the way he defined &quot;is.&quot;  The 1908 Oxford translation of Aristotle included in note 4 on page 181 illustrates the kind of compartmentalization that most people exhibited in thinking about the impeachment proceedings:<br />&quot;For neither are `to be' and `not to be' and the participle `being' significant of any fact, unless something is added; for they do not themselves indicate anything, but imply a copulation, of which we cannot form a conception apart from the things coupled.&quot;course.

The Contents has a lot of section number and titles, but the possibility of some confusion is already obvious in the title for section 3, &quot;The significance of the first part of the system with regard to the designation of both its titles.&quot; (p. v, pp. 17-26).  This still relates to the early part of the Introduction before &quot;Preliminary Consideration&quot; (p. v, pp. 32-42), which consists of section 5, &quot;The presupposition of the Phenomenology:  Its absolute beginning with the absolute.&quot;  If this seems excessive in the substitution of words for whatever this series of lectures is supposed to be about, there is a little chart of the basic Phenomenology-system at the bottom of page 7 which shows how Part I of Hegel's philosophy, his book, PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT, is merely an introduction to the Encyclopedia-system, which Hegel originally called Part II, before it was written, but which was divided in three parts, Logic, Philosophy of Nature, and Philosophy of Spirit, in the Encyclopedia which included Phenomenology of Spirit as merely &quot;The second section of the first part (subjective spirit)&quot; (p. 7) of the three main divisions included &quot;in the transformed system of philosophy.&quot;  (p. 7).  Heidegger admits that this is a very philosophical move:<br />&quot;But should one not say then that Hegel already at the beginning of his work presupposes and anticipates what he wants to achieve only at the end?  Certainly this must be said.  Indeed, whoever wishes to understand anything of his work must say that again and again.  The attempt to diminish this `fact'--as we would like to call it--show, furthermore, how little this work has been understood. . . . For it pertains to the essential character of philosophy that wherever philosophy sets to work in terms of its basic question and becomes a work, it already anticipates precisely that which it says later.&quot;  (p. 30).<br />These lectures on Hegel's first major work &quot;constitutes the lecture course given by Heidegger at the University of Freiburg during the winter semester of 1930/31.  The German edition, edited by Ingtraud Goerland, was published in 1980 by Vittorio Klostermann Verlag.&quot;  (p. viii).  Normally publication dates matter little in philosophy, and the English translation did not appear until 1988, but the publication in German in 1980 might be considered an answer to specific questions raised by hotshot American philosopher and Princeton professor Walter Kaufmann, near the end of his life, who published a three-volume set in 1980 called Discovering the Mind, after some of the ideas were presented in 1974 and the first draft was completed in 1976, in which Hegel was considered too rushed to be considered philosophical:  &quot;especially in his first book he came to write at such a pace that he put fleeting thoughts and doubtful notions down on paper and then had to send them to the printer without any opportunity to rethink what he had written.&quot;  (DM, V. I, pp. 255-256).  Volume II made the same points regarding the publication of Heidegger's first original work, only half a system in which &quot;Heidegger secularized Christian preaching about guilt, dread, and death, but claimed to break with two thousand years of Western thought.&quot; (DM, VII, p. xvi).  Privately, in &quot;an unpublished letter that Heidegger had written to Karl Loewith on August 19, 1921&quot; (DM, VII, p. 170), Heidegger had written &quot;but it must be added that I am no philosopher, and I do not imagine that I am doing anything remotely comparable; that is not my intention. . . . I am a `Christian theologian.' &quot; (DM, VII, p. 171).<br />It should be obvious that Heidegger was capable of recognizing systems and identifying them quite easily.  In HEGEL'S PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT, he has titles in his Contents that call out:  &quot;the System of Science,&quot; &quot;1. The system ofthe phenomenology and of the encyclopedia,&quot; &quot;2. Hegel's conception of a system of science,&quot; &quot;b)  Absolute and relative knowledge.  Philosophy as the system of science,&quot; &quot;4.  The inner mission of the phenomenology of spirit as the first part of the system.&quot;  Such an understanding of systems is entirely philosophical, and Heidegger's defense of his BEING AND TIME in the final few pages of these lectures is entirely philosophical in nature.  He was not supposed to be writing about himself, but about the philosophical &quot;problematic of `being and time' &quot; (pp. 146-147) which previously flared up &quot;for the first and only time, namely, in Kant--people refuse to see the problem and speak rather of my arbitrarily reading my own views into Kant.  There is something peculiar about the lack of understanding in our contemporaries by virtue of which one can become famous all of a sudden, and indeed in a dubious sense.&quot;  (p. 147).  That he could complain about being famous as a philosopher already in 1931, before any notoriety from political scandals could make the picture as messy as a German mentality would be a few years later, tends to show that Heidegger had a better grasp of philosophical matters than any of his competitors, of whom only Karl Jaspers, the famous doctor-philosopher whose books include one on GENERAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, springs to mind as truly great.<br />Heidegger pictures Hegel's first book as a process of creeping up on absolute knowledge.  &quot;Hence, the work ends with the short section DD, which is entitled `Absolute Knowledge.' &quot;  (pp. 32-33).  This leads up to the main assignment:<br />&quot;In this lecture course I presuppose such a first reading of the entire work.  If such a reading has not taken place or does not take place in the next few weeks, there is no sense in sitting here:  You cheat not only me but yourselves.  However, the first reading is not a guarantee that with the second reading we really understand the work.

(English and German Edition)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Great Title, tough text	The best guide to this book is the contents, pages iii-iv, which have topic titles for every few pages that probably won't mean a thing the first time you read them.  If you are serious about this book, you will pay attention to those titles.  Unless you speak German or Latin, or have a fantastic memory of why an expert like Heidegger would mention conglomerating thinkers like Hegel, the titles in the Contents will be the best guide you will have to figuring out what you are already supposed to know, when it finally matters.  You won't get such help again, when you finally reach long sections on judgment (pp. 153-181), synthetic judgments (pp. 181-184), and the final section of:<br />II.  The Question About the Thing in Kant's Main Work . . .<br />7.  Systematic representation of all the synthetic principles of pure understanding (pp. 184-244).<br />If there was ever a question that Martin Heidegger could use to demonstrate his knowledge of philosophy as a distinctly human outlook on what anyone might encounter, the book WHAT IS A THING? puts that question in the title.  Most of the book is a discussion of Kant's philosophical project, as seen from a far more modern perspective.  A short Preface by Martin Heidegger, dated April, 1962, states:<br />This work presents the text of a lecture which was held in the winter semester, 1935-36, at the University of Freiburg.  The lecture was entitled &quot;Basic Questions of Metaphysics.&quot;<br />The English translation by W. B. Barton, Jr. and Vera Deutsch is followed by an analysis by Eugene T. Gendlin of the University of Chicago, as published in 1967.  The Contents has detailed titles for the sections at the beginning of the book, including 12 items and an enumerated &quot;13.  Summary&quot; on &quot;A.  Various Ways of Questioning About the Thing&quot; before getting to the main topic, &quot;B. Kant's Manner of Asking About the Thing.&quot;  I was puzzled by the opening remarks, but the Analysis points out, &quot;Although written as a simple common-sense discussion, it contains all of Heidegger's major points.&quot;  (p. 247).  Most of the Analysis sticks to English, but four pages are referred to as supporting the idea, &quot;An object in German is a Gegenstand, literally a standing-against.&quot;  (p.260).  There is an index of German Terms in which ten pages of Heidegger's lecture are listed for the term Gegenstand, one page for Gegenheit, another page for Gegenstandlichkeit, another for Gegenstehen, a few for Gegenstehenlassen, and even one for Gegen-uns-stehenden.  (p. 302).  I don't know German well enough to know if this is getting too personal for you, but something bipolar seems to be an aspect of WHAT IS A THING?<br />The indices are of Names, German Terms, Latin Terms, and Greek Terms.  The topics listed in the Contents manage to be in English for Part A., but the first word in B. I. 4. is in Greek characters, which I believe can be transliterated as Logos.  Heidegger is close to the ancient Greek beginnings of philosophy, the problems encountered in Plato and the attempt at scientific determinations which Aristotle wrote about extensively.  The concern with Latin in this book seems to be derived from the work of Sir Isaac Newton, whose Principia in Latin was published in 1686-87.  A major topic in Heidegger's lectures seems to spring from the shift in philosophy from Aristotle through Newton to Kant:<br />&quot;Five years after the publication of the CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, exactly one hundred years after Newton's PRINCIPIA, Kant published an essay entitled THE METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL SCIENCE (1786).  On the basis of the position reached in the CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON it is a conscious supplement and counterpart to Newton's work.  At the conclusion of the preface to his piece Kant expressly refers to Newton's work.&quot;  (p. 77).<br />Greek terms for mathematics can be found on pages 69-75 and 91.  Latin terms for universal mathematics and common mathematics appear on page 101.  On the pages in between (77, 92), the Latin phrase `axiomata sive leges motus' this title of a section of Newton's work &quot;in which he presents the fundamental determinations about things as moved&quot; (p. 92) is almost translated as &quot;The project is axiomatic.  Insofar as every science and cognition is expressed in propositions, the cognition which is taken and posited in the mathematical project is of such a kind as to set things upon their foundation in advance.&quot;  (p. 92).  Trying to put Heidegger's point in a Latin phrase and basic German words:<br />&quot;1.  The mathematical is, as mente concipere, a project (Entwarf) of thingness (Dingheit) which, as it were, skips over the things.

On the pages in between (77, 92), the Latin phrase `axiomata sive leges motus' this title of a section of Newton's work &quot;in which he presents the fundamental determinations about things as moved&quot; (p. 92) is almost translated as &quot;The project is axiomatic.  Insofar as every science and cognition is expressed in propositions, the cognition which is taken and posited in the mathematical project is of such a kind as to set things upon their foundation in advance.&quot;  (p. 92).  Trying to put Heidegger's point in a Latin phrase and basic German words:<br />&quot;1.  The mathematical is, as mente concipere, a project (Entwarf) of thingness (Dingheit) which, as it were, skips over the things.

What seemed mysterious about McLuhan's mirth, when I was merely reading his books, might be even worse, now that I can`t stop thinking about how he topped everyone else, driven, as only a McLuhan fan would be, into trying to explain how Marshall McLuhan writing letters, attempting to explain his wildly radical ideas to the people of his world, ought to be understood as being comic, like a light-saber stab at grasping things that extended far beyond irony.  Collapse might be the word that is used so often in this book that, if it had been listed in the Index, the Index would have been more than 15 pages.<br />To understand modern society as a comic society, it helps to get beyond the famous comedians, movie stars, and around the little kid characters of `South Park' who attempt, in a thoroughly juvenile manner, to create their own involvement in modern life.  In the intellectual direction, Marshall McLuhan stands as a character possessing a level of thought which allows LETTERS OF MARSHALL McLUHAN to be a prime example of humor in action.  This might not be the perfect book for every reader, but it coincides nicely with my appreciation of how entertainment values resonate with real life.  This review is not an attempt to achieve some overall evaluation of this book.  Out of spite, I will try the opposite approach, emphasizing the idiosyncratic abuse of intellect as a weapon used by Marshall McLuhan to attack everything which any superpower would attempt to do while disguising itself as ordinary.<br />There are several dozen references in the book to Canada, CBC, CBC-TV, and CRTC (Canadian Radio-Television Commission).  McLuhan certainly felt enough at home there to enjoy himself by sending Pierre Elliott Trudeau a letter on January 5, 1973, which began:<br />Dear Pierre,<br />A one-liner that is very flexible in its use goes:  &quot;As Zeus said to Narcissus:  `Watch yourself!' &quot;  (p. 461).<br />At a time when the major powers were moving towards signing a ceasefire agreement in Paris, McLuhan was trying to draw attention to Viet Nam as a resonant interval, where the action is, a gap, an interface, understood as the political game, which is considered a game because it &quot;would seem to be rooted in the awareness of `play' as crux in all forms of social action.  It is a basic feature of play that it keeps us in touch, and is also extremely involving of our facilities.&quot;  (p. 461).  One of the key failures of the United States in Nam was the lack of success in imposing the official American policy on the views of those who were totally involved.  Policy was set by top officials in meetings in which the top priorities were more concerned about global geopolitics, which is bound to stumble in a world that McLuhan was trying to describe to Trudeau as being much more complex, especially to individuals:<br />&quot;When we are using only a small part of our faculties, we are working.  When we are totally involved, we are playing.  The artist is always at leisure, especially when most intensely engaged in making.&quot;  (p. 461).<br />What kind of an artist was Marshall McLuhan?  The easier question is how comic was he?  He could easily picture people sitting at home, within their own four walls, raging at the world outside, and he wasn't afraid to mention ongoing events to tell people what he thought.  After going to a dinner in Washington, D.C., at which he sat next to Vice President Hubert Humphrey and &quot;jokingly explained the advantages of living in a backward country like Canada.&quot; (p. 342), McLuhan sent Humphrey a letter on February 9, 1967, thanking him for &quot;sending me that splendid picture of us both.&quot;  In case Humphrey wasn't quite sure what people were thinking, McLuhan also wrote:<br />&quot;Viet is our first TV war.  TV creates an audience involvement in depth that automatically creates alienation of the public.  The same news covered by the old hot media like press has a very different effect.<br />&quot;While we are Westernizing the East by our old technology, we are Easternizing ourselves by the new technology.  TV is an orientalizing force, taking us all on an `inner trip' that blurs the old idea of private identity altogether.&quot;  (p. 342).<br />Calling attention to such forces, McLuhan expected radical changes to come about.  In a letter arranging a discussion in Maryland in 1969, McLuhan even predicted:<br />&quot;By the same token, if the slaughter houses were on all media every day, meat would disappear from our diet at once.  Photographic news coverage killed public hangings.  TV coverage makes the Viet business difficult to get on with. . . . The interface between print culture and electronic culture not only creates student unrest, it creates a collapse of all existing organizations in business and other establishments of the world.  This has nothing to do with ideology or concepts.&quot;  (p. 389).<br />Students certainly aren't as big an issue since the 1960s ended and they rested, whether it was because the draft ended or the philosophy of political change dropped into some hole that McLuhan thought was already there.  Second guessing how McLuhan was wrong about some of our own current events merely avoids a larger question that no one is showing any willingness to face, if a comic society is finally going to realize that a few ideas have to make sense, after the economic collapse follows the financial collapse that may come if owning stock becomes worth less than having a job or social security.  Imagining the doom of American policy in Nam produced more mirth than we are likely to feel at the ultimate demise of everything we face today, but McLuhan ought to get credit for making us think about going off in this direction.  After the laugh, how many of us have really been there, done that?ess has a very different effect.<br />&quot;While we are Westernizing the East by our old technology, we are Easternizing ourselves by the new technology.

This book of essays is written mainly by college professors, with one by Albert Goldman, a successful writer known mainly for his biographies.  The authors' scholarly specialties include Hebrew, Comparative Literature, History, English, General Studies in the Humanities, and the most ancient scholarly claim is a position in Yiddish Language and Literature in the Jewish sector of the Kiev Pedagogic Institute from 1928 to 1931, in the case of Meyer Wiener (1893-1941), who contributed &quot;On Sholom Aleichem's humor&quot; (pp. 37-52).  Irving Howe is also famous as the Editor of `Dissent.'  If that sounds vaguely un-American, Howe might still feel more American than Michael Greenstein, Associate Professor of English at the University of Sherbrooke, Quebec.  Someone in this book describes Charlie Chaplin as being very English Jewish, typical of the categories needed to comprehend the variety that this book attempts to cover.  There is no index, and notes are collected at the end of each essay.  The authors drop far more names than notes.  Albert Goldman has no notes, but he mentions 24 names in his first paragraph, plus the Marx Brothers, in a list which starts &quot;From the earliest years of vaudeville,&quot; (p. 80) and &quot;to the sick comics, Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, Shelly Berman, Woody Allen--they've all been Jews.&quot;  (p. 80).<br />There is an attempt to branch out to other subcultures in &quot;Beyond Kvetching and Jiving:  The Thrust of Jewish and Black Folkhumor&quot; (pp. 53-76, notes pp. 76-79), which cites a page of an article, &quot;Jokes Negroes Tell on Themselves&quot; by Langston Hughes in `Negro Digest' (June 1951).  The other essay title with Yiddish words is &quot;Lenny Bruce:  Shpritzing the Goyim/Shocking the Jews&quot; (pp. 89-104) by Sanford Pinsker.  The theme of comically vile speech is continued with &quot;The Unkosher Comediennes:  From Sophie Tucker to Joan Rivers&quot; (pp. 105-123, notes pp. 123-124) by Sarah Blacher Cohen, who also wrote the &quot;Introduction:  The Varieties of Jewish Humor&quot; (pp. 1-14, notes pp. 14-15).  The history is a bit older than I expected.  Sophie Tucker was Sophie Abuza until she married Louis Tuck at the age of sixteen, had a son, and &quot;left the baby with her parents to break into New York show business.&quot;  (p. 106).  A few of her songs were worth putting down on paper in a surprisingly explicit way, and I'm most fond of the song &quot;When am I Getting the Mink, Mr. Fink?&quot;  (p. 109).<br />The essay on Lenny Bruce by Sanford Pinsker starts by calling Lenny a &quot;neologist.&quot;  (p. 89).  Once Lenny got started on a topic, he let loose &quot;Words, showers of them, unleashed, sprayed, machine-gunned at the audience until they `cracked up,' couldn't stand it anymore . . . that was Lenny Bruce's brand of neology whether he was `working a room' or talking on the telephone.&quot;  (p. 90).  The best example of Jewish and goyish is:<br />`When Bruce insists, for example, that &quot;Pumpernickel is Jewish and, as you know, white bread is very goyish,&quot; he both reduces &quot;difference&quot; to a matter of supermarket preference and makes it clear that the Jews were hipper, smarter, superior, chosen--because they saw their corned beef through a rye, darkly.'  (p. 92).<br />Literary Americans and those who go to movies might be familiar with the works of Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Saul Bellow, and Philip Roth.  There are a few more authors mentioned in this book.  In fact, each of the essays in this book might have a list of favorite authors lurking somewhere within its appreciation of how well humor works.  It helps to have some sense of how modern writers picked up themes from people who do not ordinarily say what everybody else wouldn't say under any circumstances.  The modern writer is already aware that such circumstances exist.  The jokes in this book won't seem any more stale now than they were in 1987, when it was published.  Probably one good reason this book does not have an index is because literary society does not have a convention for how to list jokes about God.  I'm not going to tell you where they are, beyond:<br />&quot;We have a God in heaven, thank God; but has he got a people on earth, God help him!&quot;  (p. 17).eason this book does not have an index is because literary society does not have a convention for how to list jokes about God.

There is a doctor attending a dying patient at the beginning of the play, but the doctor is a minor character.  Most of the plot is about young people discovering what happened 23 years earlier, when an actress, a painter, and a poet started to live their lives as single people instead of forming couples, except that the plot reveals who had been the most significant couples in the days before being single was realized to be the kind of freedom most likely to produce youthful artistic accomplishments.  One of the creepy aspects of the play is how artistic skill is tied to youthful self-confidence, the pride in one's work that is difficult for an actress to maintain if she has been Marilyn Monroe for too long, for example.  Even the actress is a minor character in this play.  A professor of art who is functioning mainly as the head of some institution is a symbol of the societal need for fatherhood, but he is even a minor character compared to a picture that was painted 23 years before and a poetic image that might drive someone insane if the actuality of the image breaks into reality.  The picture becomes the life and love of this play, but most of the characters treat poetry like it is death itself.  Such comprehension might be more wrenching than creepy for people who are experts at this kind of thing, but what matters is that it is well done.	2003-12-19

This is more than the texts of a lecture series.  There are eight lectures given by T. S. Eliot (1888-1965) in 1926, &quot;On the Metaphysical Poetry of the Seventeenth Century with Special Reference to Donne, Crawshaw and Cowley.&quot;  Then there are three lectures, &quot;The Varieties of Metaphysical Poetry,&quot; given at The Johns Hopkins University in 1933.  There is an Author's Preface which is more like a note of the author to himself, on &quot;the intention of the author to rewrite these lectures as a book.&quot;  (p. 41).  That book &quot;is intended as one volume of a trilogy under the general title of `The Disintegration of the intellect' &quot;  (p. 41).<br />This book is edited and introduced by Ronald Schuchard, who has provided information about the circumstances in which the lectures were written and given, additions and corrections noted on the manuscript, literary context, translations of quotations, corrections of mistranslations (some of which were noted on the manuscript), notes on similar themes in other works by T. S. Eliot, and in Appendix I, a French translation of the lecture on pages 93-117 published as &quot;Deux Attitudes Mystiques:  Dante and Donne&quot; in 1927.  (pp. 309-318).<br />Dante ?  A great poet, is mainly of interest in this book as a philosophical poet, as recognized in the book THREE PHILOSOPHICAL POETS by George Santayana, which T. S. Eliot &quot;had read and mastered at Harvard, a book that had stimulated his theory and that was to become a central document in his Clark lectures.&quot;  (p. 2).  T. S. Eliot also accepted as a definition of metaphysical the conventional identification of poets and critics familiar with the great anthology, METAPHYSICAL LYRICS AND POEMS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY by Herbert Grierson.  In addition, an example of great poetry, Sappho's `Ode to Anactoria' (c. 600 B.C.) is printed in full in a note where it is mentioned by T. S. Eliot as &quot;a real advance, a development, in human consciousness; it sets down, within its verse, the unity of an experience which had previously only existed unconsciously; in recording the physical concomitants of an emotion it modifies the emotion.&quot;  (p. 51).<br />The first lecture attempts to establish the function of poetry, but students of Freud's &quot;Psychopathology of Everyday Life&quot; will be interested in how often the quotations on the fly by T. S. Eliot have been modified by his memory to apply specifically to him.  On page 52, he substituted necessity in place of nervousness for the reason two characters, &quot;not from good will, Marched along shoulder to shoulder&quot; in THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK by Lewis Carroll.  On page 53, &quot;When Shakespeare says `Man must abide'&quot; he is quoting from KING LEAR, v. ii. 9-11 which says &quot;Men must endure.&quot;  On page 56 the same line is compared with some lines from PURGATORIO by Dante, after asserting, &quot;If you recall my tentative division of the three types of philosophical poetry, you will see at once that Dante is the great exemplar not only for the type which forms the theme of these lectures, but of every type.&quot;  (p. 56).  The translation of the Italian in the notes does not attempt to inform readers of what the few Italian words misremembered in the text might have indicated in a Freudian analysis.<br />There is an Index to Editorial Material on pages 335-343, following the Index to the Lectures on pages 327-334.  Items not included in the indices include the lists of lectures given in Appendix II and Appendix III, indicative of a range of scholarship at the highest intellectual level, mentioning a 1992-3 series on `Three Models of Truthfulness:  Thucydides, Diderot, Nietzsche.'  (p. 322).  People who find that exciting might also discover that they missed `Irony and Solidarity' by Richard Rorty in 1986-7.  How close is this book to real philosophy?  The historical approach to its subject matter includes:  &quot;Not only a diversion of inquiry; it is rather as if, at certain times, the constitution of the human mind altered to adapt itself to new categories of truth, and new elements of thought.&quot;  (p. 79).  &quot;But dissolution so frequently begins within, that I think that the Jesuits had a great deal to do with it:  their fine distinctions and discussions of conduct and casuistry tend in the direction of a certain self-consciousness which had not been conspicuous in the world before.  I am here more concerned with defining clearly the difference in point of view, a true Copernican revolution which occurred centuries before Kant was born, a difference which marks the real abyss between the classic scholastic philosophy and all philosophy since.&quot;  (p. 80).  Nietzsche shows up as the author of a motto in a work &quot;which TSE told Hesse he would have published in translation in the `Criterion' had it been shorter (L1 [THE LETTERS OF T. S. ELIOT] 510).&quot;  (p. 81, n. 38).  &quot;Mankind suddenly retires inside its several skulls, until you hear Nietzsche - pretty well tormented in his cranial lodging - declaring that `nothing is inside, nothing is outside'.&quot;  (pp. 80-81).<br />The combination of poetry and philosophy in these lectures is leading to consideration of a minor poet.  &quot;Jules Laforgue was a young man who died at the age of twenty-seven in the year 1877. . . .  His poetry, and even his prose, is immature, rough and sentimental. . . .  He had an innate craving for order:  that is, that every feeling should have its intellectual equivalent, its philosophical justification, and that every idea should have its emotional equivalent, its sentimental justification.  The only world in which he could have satisfied himself, therefore, was a world such as Dante's.&quot;  (p. 212).  Similar information is given at the beginning of the final lecture on pages 281-282.  As an example for poets in our time:  &quot;One positive contribution towards poetry is all that one can hope to make; beyond that it does not matter whether one is Shakespeare or Jules Laforgue; whether one is `original' or `derivative'.&quot;  (p. 289).nquiry; it is rather as if, at certain times, the constitution of the human mind altered to adapt itself to new categories of truth, and new elements of thought.&quot;  (p. 79).  &quot;But dissolution so frequently begins within, that I think that the Jesuits had a great deal to do with it:  their fine distinctions and discussions of conduct and casuistry tend in the direction of a certain self-consciousness which had not been conspicuous in the world before.

US	44184384	R2YF5G3SJ5E2KW	0765804263	858115194	Woodrow Wilson: A Psychological Study (American Presidency Series)	Books	5	6	17	N	N	I should read this book more often	Sigmund Freud and William C. Bullitt produced a psychological study called THOMAS WOODROW WILSON, but they couldn't call it a psychoanalytical examination because they could not get Wilson, who died in 1924, to submit to the kind of personal investigation that would confirm the factors of his inner life.  We all have good reason to fear (it was almost four years ago when I signed a release to allow the Secret Seervice to have a copy of my psychiatric file to see how dangerous I was) what judgments psychiatrists could use to render our souls, and the history of psychiatry shows that politicians are not the first to have reason to complain.  THE FREUD/JUNG LETTERS, Edited by William McGuire, allows us to go way back to 18 December 1912, when Jung wrote to Freud, &quot;I would, however, point out that your technique of treating your pupils like patients is a blunder.  In that way you produce either slavish sons or impudent puppies&quot;  (Freud/Jung, p. 534).  Freud was quite capable, however, of treating the whole world like patients, and with the assistance of William C. Bullitt, who had known Wilson and wanted to write about him, had produced a final draft of this book in 1932.<br />Those were raw times, and the final text was not settled until Freud and Bullitt met in London in 1939.  Religion was a major factor in Wilson's early life, and its benefits are considered &quot;well suited to women and to men whose femininity exceeded their masculinity. . . . A more masculine boy than Tommy Wilson would have felt hostility to the `mores' of the family and community in which the Minister's son was reared; but he felt no impulse to revolt.  His masculinity was feeble. . . .  He was fortunate to have been born in a nation which was protected from reality during the nineteenth century by inherited devotion to the ideals of Wyclif, Calvin and Wesley.&quot;  (p. 71).  Now the geopolitical superpower keeps acting like Americans have finally faced the conflicts of those who &quot;had been brought up in the comparative freedom of European civilization.&quot;  (p. 71).<br />After Wilson's father died, this book pictures Wilson as the personification of the modern American attitude:  &quot;he assumed his father's throne, became God in his unconscious and began to act with a sense of his own inevitable righteousness.&quot;  (p. 78).  Wilson's major confrontations followed the pattern of a &quot;neurotic who has lodged a considerable portion of his libido in identification with Christ is apt, when faced by battle and harassed by fear, to take refuge in the comforting illusion that he too by submitting will achieve ultimate victory.  He fears to fight.  Therefore, through his identification with Christ he convinces himself that he does not need to fight, that by submitting he will achieve his aims.  And, if he has not a firm grip on reality, he is apt to convince himself after he has submitted that he has in fact won a victory, although in reality he has suffered complete defeat.&quot;  (p. 78).  This seems weird, applied to Wilson, because America won World War I, just like America overthrew the government of Iraq in 2003, just before a different kind of hell was breaking loose.<br />&quot;In Paris at the Peace Conference he feared the consequences of fighting.  He submitted, then declared that he had won a victory and announced that the Treaty of Versailles was indeed the peace of `absolute justice' which he had set out to establish.  His identification of himself with Christ was the mental mechanism which enabled him to reach that somewhat fantastic conclusion.&quot;  (p. 79).<br />In my own lifetime, &quot;Peace is at hand&quot; in October 1972 was followed by an agreement in January 1973 which barely qualified as a ceasefire for troops who were Vietnamese, and for the U.S. Congress, which was asked to keep sending money to support an ongoing war.  The North Vietnamese never did get money from the U.S. to rebuild for the incidental damage that might have been caused by American strikes from 1964 to 1973, and victory, as it was proclaimed for those in the United States, seemed to the peace crowd to be more like a nefarious (possibly still secret) plan to get the Vietnamese sides to keep fighting each other with a minimum amount of American assistance.  Nixon, Kissinger, and Ford might not have the same ultimate motivation as Wilson, but we can expect that each faced &quot;the conflict between his femininity and his exalted Super-Ego which demanded that he should be all masculinity.  If we are asked why from time to time his symptoms increased to the point of `breakdown,' we can answer only by generalization that his symptoms increased in severity whenever the events of his life produced a sharpening of the fundamental conflict.&quot;  (p. 81).<br />America needs the kind of president who can face such fundamental conflicts without such symptoms, but democracy ought to allow people who don't want America to out-German the Germans at their own personal, political, and geopolitical goals to have a say in how such conflicts could be avoided.  Clearly, if we don't want to fight, we should stay out of endless wars.  Even Wilson's troubles did not end &quot;the day when he was received in Paris as the Saviour of Mankind&quot; (p. 82).  By September, 1919, he was making speeches in which he complained, &quot;The formula of Pan-Germanism, you remember, was Bremen to Bagdad -- Bremen on the North Sea to Bagdad in Persia.&quot;  (p. 286).

If we are asked why from time to time his symptoms increased to the point of `breakdown,' we can answer only by generalization that his symptoms increased in severity whenever the events of his life produced a sharpening of the fundamental conflict.&quot;  (p. 81).<br />America needs the kind of president who can face such fundamental conflicts without such symptoms, but democracy ought to allow people who don't want America to out-German the Germans at their own personal, political, and geopolitical goals to have a say in how such conflicts could be avoided.  Clearly, if we don't want to fight, we should stay out of endless wars.  Even Wilson's troubles did not end &quot;the day when he was received in Paris as the Saviour of Mankind&quot; (p. 82).  By September, 1919, he was making speeches in which he complained, &quot;The formula of Pan-Germanism, you remember, was Bremen to Bagdad -- Bremen on the North Sea to Bagdad in Persia.&quot;  (p. 286).

Smith might be the book that the average reader of Jung's works wanted someone to write, simplifying the concepts that made it so difficult for the tormented Jung to write himself.  \\"By the age of four he had incorporated into his psyche the sophisticated and frightening concept of the underground man-eater dream, closely associated in his case with the burial of the dead.\\"  (p. 21).  The Notes for the entire book are on pages 179-181.  These are so short, it might be ironic that Chapter 3, Note 2 is simply, \\"Although Jung had never met Miller, he took her fifteen-page report of dreams and visions, published in Geneva in 1906, and expanded it into a book of more than four hundred pages.\\"  (p. 180).  The key to such authorship is clearly based on having a mind which has been caught in the same web, as is also true on the intellectual side of the picture.  \\"Jung was interested in a variety of philosophers and religious mystics, and upon close examination, one can see that the experiences of these philosophers and mystics paralleled those of Jung.  Swedenborg, the great Swedish mystic, clearly engrossed Jung for this reason.\\"  (p. 104).  Anything which triggered \\"the divided parts of his own psyche\\" (p. 2) helped him appreciate \\"that the approach to the numinous is the real therapy\\" (p. 3).<br />A major emphasis on Jung's father is that he \\"had been unable to secure an academic position.  Hence he became the minister to a series of small country parishes.\\"  (p. 13).  In a world where most people seem condemned to be spectators, Pastor Jung faced those who worshipped each Sunday with his suggestions for staying out of trouble, and he told his son, \\"Be anything you like except a theologian.\\"  (pp. 14, 32, 33).<br />Jumping ahead in the book to the relationship between Jung and Freud, Smith mentioned a letter on page 34 about a traumatic incident in Jung's childhood, which \\"Jung kept the memory of the assault secret from all except Freud until old age.\\"  (p. 34).  A lot more can be learned from the letter from Jung to Freud dated 28 October, 1907, in which Jung admitted that he would \\"rather not have said\\" how much he was in awe of Freud.  \\"Actually--and I confess this to you with a struggle--I have a boundless admiration for you both as a man and as a researcher, and I bear you no conscious grudge.  So the self-preservation complex does not come from there; it is rather that my veneration for you has something of the character of a `religious' crush.  Though it does not really bother me, I still feel it is disgusting and ridiculous because of its undeniable erotic undertone.  This abominable feeling comes from the fact that as a boy I was the victim of a sexual assault by a man I once worshipped.\\"  Jung was astute in allowing himself to confess this to Freud as a confirmation of many of Freud's beliefs, as well as indicating Jung's trauma from a personal incident that might be generalized politically.<br />Chapter 2 of THE DESCENT OF MAN by Charles Darwin is called On The Manner of Development of Man from some Lower Form, in which a HISTORY OF GREENLAND by Cranz is quoted on the belief of the Esquimaux \\"that ingenuity and dexterity in seal-catching (their highest art and virtue) is hereditary; there is really something in it, for the son of a celebrated seal-catcher will distinguish himself, though he lost his father in childhood.\\"  Our devotion to intellectual, spiritual, and political leadership might follow genetically, if it is understood that modern people, largely reduced to being spectators, worship anyone who has kindled a spark to seek the ultimate prize.  Frankly, Jung's trauma reminds me of \\"Ernst Roehm, Minister of the Reich, one of the founders of the Nazi Party, and Chief of Staff of the SA.\\"  (Max Gallo, THE NIGHT OF LONG KNIVES, p. 2).  On December 31, 1933, Roehm had received a letter from Adolf Hitler thanking him for \\"the force which allowed me to wage the final battle for power,\\" and as leader of the \\"SA to assure the victory of the National Socialist Revolution on the domestic front, . . . and the unity of our people.\\"  (Gallo, p. 7).  Roehm was among those killed between Saturday, June 30, 1934, and Monday, July 2.  A speech by Hitler on Friday, July 13, 1934 to the Reichstag meeting in the Opera House made Roehm a scapegoat for everything that Hitler had attempted to rid himself of.  \\"The life the Chief of Staff and a certain number of other leaders had begun to lead was intolerable from the point of view of National Socialism.  The question was no longer that he and his friends had violated every decency, but rather that the contagion was widespread, and was affecting even the most distant elements.\\"  (Gallo, p. 9).  As much as this seems ruthless, Smith was able to see this trait as common.  \\"Both Jung and his mother tended to personify aspects of the self.  Frequently in his autobiography he refers to the ruthlessness of his mother's No. 2 Personality.  But he too, as he acknowledges at the end of MEMORIES (356), could be utterly ruthless at times.\\"  (Smith, p. 27).  The Retrospect which starts on page 355 of MEMORIES, DREAMS, REFLECTIONS by C. G. Jung pictures himself more as a spectator.  \\"I stand and behold, admiring what nature can do.\\"  (Jung, p. 355).  \\"People who see nothing have no certainties and can draw no conclusions--or do not trust them even if they do.  I do not know what started me off perceiving the stream of life.\\"  (Jung, pp. 355-356).  \\"I was able to become intensely interested in many people; but as soon as I had seen through them, the magic was gone.  In this way I made many enemies.\\"  (Jung, p. 357).d as leader of the \\"SA to assure the victory of the National Socialist Revolution on the domestic front, . . . and the unity of our people.\\"  (Gallo, p. 7).

US	44184384	R2VZ9IBYS0YMW8	0226320847	329308821	The Constitution of Liberty	Books	5	17	40	N	N	Shows why there is no elsewhere elsewhere	This is a book that can be right in ways that confound all expertise, a basic text of political economy, brilliant enough to summarize all the mistakes of the twentieth century while they were still happening.  With an author born in Europe, aware of a society with classes based on great wealth, where culture was largely the activity of a few thousand incredibly intelligent people, but, due to a bestseller of his own, exposed to the dynamic economic growth of postwar America, teaching in an offbeat center like the University of Chicago, concerned about liberty, law, \\"The Decline of Socialism and the Rise of the Welfare State,\\" Social Security, and utterly convinced of his main point:  the necessity for taxation to pay for whatever benefits a government can contrive.<br /><br />Most people are still far from appreciating the economic basis for THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY by Hayek, which stands as a political argument so solidly made, it has a quality that might be considered crazy.  Published in 1960, the amounts of money being discussed in this book are ludicrously small for people who do not live in China.  In an economic system which was striving to become global in character, Hayek was concerned about majority thinking on incomes reaching some maximum limit, which might be imposed by progressive taxation (which was worse then in America and Great Briton than it is now), as an end to economic growth.<br /><br />\\"Where this may lead is illustrated by a recent proposal, only narrowly defeated, of the National Planning Commission of India, according to which a ceiling of $6,300 per annum was to be fixed for all incomes (and a ceiling of $4,300 for salary incomes). . . . Can there be much doubt that poor countries, by preventing people from getting rich, will also slow down the general growth of wealth?  And does not what applies to the poor countries apply equally to the rich?\\"  (p. 322, Chapter Twenty, Taxation and Redistribution).<br /><br />These amounts still might be in the ballpark for what people in some parts of the world could be willing to work for, if they had the opportunity, but the nature of economics has changed so much, the idea that people anywhere could be spending any of their time for such small change, while the American military is getting a billion dollars a week to look for whoever could be inflicting some real damage on the American economy, like September 11 did, is more than enough to make people wonder what Iraqis would do with freedom if they had it.  Some rewards have been offered to Iraqis for the kind of information that what make the Americans there happy.  The American way seems to be designed for managers who can figure out how to get to the top so they can retire with a deferred compensation package in the neighborhood of $139 million, like the recently resigned president of the New York Stock Exchange, who was in danger of handing out favors to people in that ballpark.<br /><br />If millions of dollars can provide a reasonable opportunity to give a person the freedom to enjoy himself, it is surprising that spending a billion dollars a week to support the American military in Iraq is not as much fun as complaining about it.  My favorite complaint can be found in the Index of Subjects under Experts (democracy and, social security).<br /><br />\\"3.  The extreme complexity and consequent incomprehensibility of the social security systems create for democracy a serious problem. . . . As a result, the expert has come to dominate in this field as in others. . . . But, almost invariably, this new kind of expert has one distinguishing characteristic:  he is unhesitatingly in favor of the institutions on which he is expert.  This is so not merely because only one who approves of the institution will have the interest and the patience to master the details, but even more because such an effort would hardly be worth the while of anyone else:  the views of anybody who is not prepared to accept the principles of the existing institutions are not likely to be taken seriously and will carry no weight in the discussions determining current policy.\\"  (pp. 290-291).<br /><br />Hayek had seen societies become unbalanced long before America's borrowing habits made the future turn to spending freezes as a last resort.<br /><br />\\"Does anyone really believe that the average semiskilled worker in Italy is better off because 44 per cent of his employer's total outlay is handed over to the state or, in concrete figures, because of the 49 cents which his employer pays for an hour of his work, he receives only 27 cents, while 22 cents are spent for him by the state?\\"  (p. 294).<br /><br />Obviously, Italy has been operating its scheme long enough to produce benefits that rival the amount which workers get.  Similarly, it seems the American government has an acute interest in having work done overseas, to avoid American workers earning the right to retirement under a social security system which might soon be as costly for American workers.  Hayek was writing before a large portion of American social security contributions were dumped into U.S. bonds to produce the trillion dollar surpluses that were never real.  It was truly amazing that America was able to balance the books for so long with such shaky maneuvers, but the plan was to produce a system like \\"that in Germany, where about 20 percent of the total national income is placed in the hands of the social security administration.\\"  (p. 294).  With what America is spending on the military, it is never going to be able to turn that much money over to a privatized administrator.les of the existing institutions are not likely to be taken seriously and will carry no weight in the discussions determining current policy.\\"  (pp. 290-291).<br /><br />Hayek had seen societies become unbalanced long before America's borrowing habits made the future turn to spending freezes as a last resort.<br /><br />\\"Does anyone really believe that the average semiskilled worker in Italy is better off because 44 per cent of his employer's total outlay is handed over to the state or, in concrete figures, because of the 49 cents which his employer pays for an hour of his work, he receives only 27 cents, while 22 cents are spent for him by the state?\\"  (p. 294).<br /><br />Obviously, Italy has been operating its scheme long enough to produce benefits that rival the amount which workers get.

US	44184384	R2ZISJEJFBNJF0	0415165113	664876133	Fifty Key Classical Authors (Routledge Key Guides)	Books	4	5	10	N	N	A very literary history	The classical world of Greece and Rome furnished early written works in poetry, philosophy, mathematics, history, plays, and the natural sciences.  By explaining the lives of FIFTY KEY CLASSICAL AUTHORS, this book gives the historical setting in which intertextuality had 1,000 years of allusion and the dynamics of appropriation to produce meanings which were not isolated but interactive.  I would consider the authors of this book young, as the Notes at the end of the Introduction reveal that a book on Virgil by Otis which was published in 1964 was written \\"before either of the authors of this book were born.\\"  (p. xxi).<br />Back in 1964, I was taking Latin in high school, but my high school only offered two years of Latin, so after tenth and eleventh grades, I gave it up.  I avoided reading the great Greek plays studied by the honors students at the University of Michigan in 1965-66 by enrolling in the College of Engineering, which had its own English courses, in which ancient civilizations were not the key to what we were supposed to learn, though writing one paper about something that was supposed to be funny was as challenging as sticking to the factual approach for which technocrats would become famous, in the event they ever escaped being anonymous.<br />Philosophy is much more aware of its origin in the Greek world, and Plato and Aristotle show up in this book, after the early poets, writers of the great tragedies, a historian, the comic Aristophanes, \\"the best of the writers of Old Comedy,\\" (p. 84), a speechwriter who is called a logographer, and the versatile Xenophon, who even gets credit for writing \\"Socratic texts.\\"  (p. 103).  Socrates was not a writer, so he is not discussed as a main character in FIFTY KEY CLASSICAL AUTHORS, but the index reveals that he was mentioned on 16 pages, similar to Suetonius, who is mentioned on 15 pages before having his own section on pages 365-70.<br />The index is mainly names, with more people than places.  Many names which appear in the text are not to be found in the index, especially names of two words.  Though \\"the epic poet Silius Italicus\\" (p. 274) can be found in the index between Sicily and similes on page 420, modern names are listed under the last name, as in Shakespeare, William; Shelley, Mary; and Shelley, Percy.  There is an Alphabetical List of Contents on pages viii-ix in which Julius Caesar appears between Aristotle and Callimachus, then Cassius Dio before Catullus.  In the index, the first entry starting with a C is Calabria, and Julius Caesar shows up between Julia (daughter of Augustus) and Juno on page 417.<br />There is no listing in the index for mathematics, but plenty for madness, manuscripts, marriage, Megalopolis, metaphor, metre, misogyny, mothers, Muses, and mutiny.  Following a single entry for Rabelais, there are multiple pages for readers, reading, realism, reception, recognition, a single entry for recusatio, many for repetition, revenge and reversal of fortune/peripeteia, but only a few for Rhodes and ring composition.<br />Occasionally the point of view in FIFTY KEY CLASSICAL AUTHORS is very British.  In discussing Seneca the Younger, \\"whose work dominated the Roman literary scene of the first century AD,\\" (p. 301), the book introduces him by saying, \\"However, it was during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras that Seneca really came into his own.  Seneca's tragedies superseded their Greek models, which were less accessible to a community who knew Latin much better than Greek.\\"  (p. 300).  For those who missed seeing  a recent performance, take comfort in knowing that the 1968 adaptation of Seneca's OEDIPUS by Ted Hughes \\"was revived in April 1998 at the Northcott Theatre in Exeter.\\"  (p. 301).  My interest in Seneca might be like Ezra Pound's, who wrote about him in his ABC OF READING in 1934, in which Pound \\"saw Seneca's writings as symptomatic of a nation `losing a grip of its empire and of itself.'  Yet Pound's condemnation of Seneca didn't prevail.\\"  (p. 301).  Could it be that the authors of this book stopped their timeline with the \\"Death of Cassius Dio\\" in post-AD 229 (p. 411) because they are not fond of those who blame the Roman Empire for falling apart?  Perhaps they want us to think that they do not approve or are not familiar with a history of Rome called HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, by someone named Edward Gibbon, who does not appear in the index of this book.  This book might be better than that one for people who are looking for useful information, but decline can also be found in the index of this book.  Even the works of Homer are not unaware of the fall of Troy, and the fall of Carthage gets a few sympathic words from the writers in this book who thought that Rome might well be damned by the rest of the world for doing something like that, so arrogant.il.\\"  (p. 301).

As a scholarly work, it maintains a certain dignity which avoids the insults that I have come to expect when reading poets like Archilochus, or Heine, and also found in the coarse German philosophers, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.  Written in the wake of the bicentennial of the French Revolution, the longest chapter is called \\"The Role of Memory in the Historiography of the French Revolution.\\"  (pp. 124-153).  The book mentions only a few philosophers, mainly Vico and Foucault.<br />Vico was one of the first to claim that Homeric epics were not written by an individual but emerged from a group of blind seers who for hundreds of years were \\"an emblem of the collective authorship of the epic poetry that bears the name.\\"  (p. 43).  HISTORY AS AN ART OF MEMORY by Patrick H. Hutton supports Vico's attempts to determine the significance and meaning of some of the world's most ancient literature.  \\"Rhapsode, he explained, literally meant `stitcher-together of songs,' and Homer was such a `binder of fables.' \\" (p. 44).  Vico's ideas are compared with the book PREFACE TO PLATO (1963) by Eric Havelock, in which, \\"Havelock was struck by the vehemence with which the philosopher Plato in his famous essay THE REPUBLIC banished the poet Homer from his projected ideal society for the `crippling effect' his poetry might have on the mind.  Although scholars had long construed Plato's judgment as a philosophical position between ancients and moderns, Havelock pointed out that the quarrel was better appreciated as a clashing of incompatible mentalities, not merely of opposing ideas. . . . Plato scorned Homer because he formed his thoughts in an altogether different way.\\"  (pp. 45-46).  Rather than blaming philosophy, it might be possible to blame Plato for attempting to think on behalf of a state that counted on loyalty far more than it valued thought.  Postmodern people who have encountered such curses (a few surfaced on some Nixon White House tapes in the 1970s) know that this long tradition of those who believe strongly in duty is not likely to disappear from history anytime soon.<br />Rather than joking about how much cursing a postmodern world has shown itself capable of producing, I should admit that I was also looking for jokes in this book, and found that jokes were mentioned in the discussion of Freud's study of \\"the unconscious mind's compulsion to repeat its unresolved dilemmas.\\"  (pp. 64-65).  Jokes which work by association with things that no one should ever forget help uncover the past.  \\"These places of memory are marked in many ways:  among them, parapraxes (slips of the tongue); jokes; dreams; screen memories; and even compulsive behavior.\\"  (p. 65).  Those who have been compelled to do many unpleasant duties might find some of them more absurd than the usual joke, but as such instances are quite common in history and still possible in postmodern times, \\"parapraxes and jokes mask the memories that lie closest to the surface of consciousness, and the unconscious conflicts that they hide are easiest to discern.\\"  (p. 66).  When a lie is really close to consciousness, the conflict that is easiest to discern is about who gets to spread lies and who is supposed to take it with stomach in, chest out, trap shut.<br />Seriously though, I thought about whether a few lines in this book might be considered insults.  Maurice Halbwachs is described as \\"admirer of the socialist tribune Jean Jaures and himself a committed socialist.  His writings display his thorough grounding in economics, not to mention a passion for statistical analysis seemingly at odds with the focus on imagery and imagination that the topic of memory requires.\\"  (pp. 73-74).  If that seems to start with something that looks like an insult, it largely escapes from it by changing the subject.  Published posthumously in 1950, Halbwachs managed to escape responsibility for things he hadn't done due to the war.  \\"One senses, too, that his thoughts on the subject were still provisional at the time of his death in 1945 in a concentration camp at Buchenwald, a victim of Nazi persecution.\\"  (p. 74).  If anything appeals to the idea of collective memory, not finished under those circumstances, his book is on the right topic.<br />Chapter 6, Michel Foucault, History as Counter-Memory, is quite free of insults, for a chapter that discusses \\"insanity\\" (p. 106), \\"the crazed, the nonconformist, and the eccentric\\"  (p. 106), \\"Madmen\\" (p. 106), \\"ship of fools\\" (p. 106) \\"pariah\\" (p. 106), \\"insane asylums\\" (p. 107), \\"Foucault's tableau of the madhouse\\" (p. 107), \\"The Foucault phenomenon well illustrates the turn from social to cultural history in French historiography since the early 1970s.  An emblem of that shift, Foucault also contributed to its accomplishment.\\"  (p. 108).  \\"Like Nietzsche, Foucault was challenging the Hegelian notion that history unfolds logically from primordial beginnings.  Most historians practicing today would consider this an intellectual battle long since won.  Few would place their faith in metahistorical designs.  But Foucault's argument took the challenge a step further by charging that an historiographical tradition unwittingly perpetuates belief in such a design.\\"  (p. 112).  \\"Laments about the demise of coherent traditions of literature or patterns of history invoke myths invented to serve the ends of those presently in power.\\"  (p. 114).  Getting really postmodern, \\"The imperative to speak openly about sexuality as a means of finding out the truth about ourselves, he observed, is the true sexual revolution of our times.\\"  (p. 114).  \\"Looking into the psyche, therefore, is like looking into the mirror image of a mirror.\\"  (p. 115).  I really skipped a lot.  Then, \\"He could be thin-skinned about criticism of his method by professional historians, as his angry reply to a review . . .\\"  (p. 115) certainly showed how reflective he could be when provoked in a postmodern way.ibility for things he hadn't done due to the war.  \\"One senses, too, that his thoughts on the subject were still provisional at the time of his death in 1945 in a concentration camp at Buchenwald, a victim of Nazi persecution.\\"  (p. 74).

The introduction quotes Deleuze on the nature of his philosophy, &quot;... We will speak of a transcendental empiricism in contrast to everything that makes up the world of the subject and object.&quot;  (p. 8, quoting Chapter One, Immanence:  A Life, p. 25).  For those who consider philosophy too confining to escape the metaphysics suggested by Kant, this might seem like a welcome suggestion, but the uniqueness of such a broad approach, as it might apply to changes in any particular life, is largely nebulous.  Even Chapter Two, Hume, in which &quot;A parallel conversion of science or theory follows:  theory becomes an inquiry (the origin of this conception is in Francis Bacon; Immanuel Kant will recall it while transforming and rationalising it when he conceives of theory as a court or tribunal)&quot; (pp. 35-36) is beyond my usual contemplation and &quot;its attempt to reduce the paradox of relations;&quot; (p. 37).  The final chapter, on Nietzsche, strikes notes which I know well enough to become critical, and I find an assertion which must make this book more unique than most:<br />&quot;Dialectics itself perpetuates this prestigiditation.  Dialectics is the art that invites us to recuperate alienated properties.&quot;  (p. 70).<br />Surely the right word for dialectics is prestidigitation, the sleight of hand that quickly moves things about to produce one thing where another was expected, but this book is produced in a world which is far more used to typing `prestige' when it has just been considering Kant, even if the paragraph preceding this unique assertion about dialectics ended with the kind of questions that Nietzsche was always throwing in Kant's direction:<br />&quot;Who can really think that Kant reinstated critique or rediscovered the idea of the philosopher as legislator?  Kant denounces false claims to knowledge, but he doesn't question the ideal of knowing; he denounces false morality, but he doesn't question the claims of morality or the nature and origin of its value.  He blames us for having confused domains and interests; but the domains remain intact, and the interests of reason, sacred (true knowledge, true morals, true religion).&quot;  (p. 70).<br />Thorough knowledge of Nietzsche is indicated by the ability to make his philosophy illustrate the grand theme of &quot;the symptoms of a decomposition.&quot;  (p. 72).  A key to this understanding is:<br />&quot;Nietzsche is the first to tell us that killing God is not enough to set about the transmutation of values.  In his work, there are at least fifteen versions of the death of God, all of them very beautiful.&quot;  (pp. 71-72).<br />Going back to dialectics as prestigiditation, most people seem to be lost in the efforts to stigmatize, or hoping for stigmatism as a vision not subject to astigmatism, particularly &quot;As long as the will to power is interpreted in terms of a `desire to dominate,' we inevitably make it depend on establish values, the only ones able to determine, in any case or conflict, who must be `recognized' as the most powerful.  We then cannot recognize the nature of the will to power as an elastic principle of all of our evaluations, as a hidden principle for the creation of new values not yet recognized.&quot;  (p. 73).<br />It might be possible to explain everything in this book by creating and giving value to words like *stigid* which unintentionally crept into the middle of a word in a complicated thought on the limits of the nature of philosophy.  The complexity of transcendental empiricism might even relate to the explanation that Deleuze offers for &quot;The will to power is the differential element from which derive the forces at work, as well as their respective quality in a complex whole.&quot;  (p. 73).  People who find this kind of thought too *stigid* for real mathematics, in which differential elements are usually determined easily if we know the formula from elementary calculus, but we rarely think about them otherwise, might not enjoy reading this book.  People who already know a lot of Nietzsche will not be surprised to find, &quot;Everywhere we see the victory of No over Yes, of reaction over action.  Life becomes adaptive and regulative, reduced to its secondary forms; we no longer know what it means to act.  Even the forces of the earth become exhausted on this desolate face.&quot;  (p. 75).  Perhaps the book has far more explanations than examples, and tends to emphasize the worst view of things overall, but it moves on, after &quot;Zarathustra cries out his great disgust, his great contempt,&quot; (p. 90).ulus, but we rarely think about them otherwise, might not enjoy reading this book.

Hayek, Vol. 1)	Books	4	3	11	N	Y	Truly a moral tangle	Written in 1988, THE FATAL CONCEIT is a summary of the economic and political arguments made in the life of its author, F. A. Hayek.  I am reading an early printing, the University of Chicago Press published this as THE COLLECTED WORKS OF F. A. HAYEK, VOLUME 1.  The attempt was not petty because the scope is so vast, dropping back to magical powers which preceded economics in Appendix G for \\"a remarkable little study by Sir James Frazer (1909) -- PSYCHE'S TASK\\" (p. 157) on \\"Superstition and the Preservation of Tradition\\" to emphasize \\"the effect of tabooing a thing.\\"  (p. 157).  This book is torn from its roots mainly by the times in which it was written, in which it is merely an example of rhetoric as an intellectual discipline that has disappeared as politics has slid to a level that assumes a micro-order no bigger than a box or a flat screen in at least one room of each house in those areas which consider themselves part of the civilized world.<br /><br />This book is a spirited defense of capitalism as an extended economic order. Hayek is utterly convinced that a close look at history shows that a strong government is more likely to stifle than to promote the efforts of those who could produce productive economic activity by following the rules which economics ought to provide for those with great wealth.  The main argument, for me, of THE FATAL CONCEIT is about morality, which is primarily avoided by modern people functioning mainly as spectators concerned with the behavior of human beings who have previously inhabited a world in which people had contact with each other.  Attempting to apply the lessons of this book is sure to be ironic in a comic society, in which those who are highest in the public eye merit the lowest form of treatment.  For example, the comedy channel on television is ready to ridicule any individual who has no way to escape from whatever comic role our entertainment values have assigned to people in positions of interest, while the audience is supposed to be too complacent to think that they can do anything about what they see.  The comedians who ape stupidity are filling in for furiously planning activists of the world, who are blatantly called intellectuals in this book, as in:<br /><br />\\"Intellectuals may of course claim to have invented new and better `social' morals that will accomplish just this, but these `new' rules represent a recidivism to the morals of the primitive micro-order, and can hardly maintain the life and health of the billions supported by the macro-order.\\"  (p. 75).<br /><br />Hayek was living in Freiburg im Breisgau in April 1988 when he penned the Preface on page 5, stating \\"There were to be no footnotes\\" and he was right until page 24, where the editor furnished information to support the text:  \\"Not only is the idea of evolution older in the humanities and social sciences than in the natural sciences, I would even be prepared to argue that Darwin got the basic ideas of evolution from economics.\\"  For Hayek, analogous laws, mechanisms, modalities and \\"cultural development rests on such inheritance -- characteristics in the form of rules guiding the mutual relations among individuals\\" (p. 25) that make sense, in the context of group selection compared to biological evolution.  \\"Despite such differences, all evolution, cultural as well as biological, is a process of continuous adaptation to unforeseen events, to contingent circumstances which could not have been forecast.  This is another reason why evolutionary theory can never put us in the position of rationally predicting and controlling future evolution.\\"  (p. 25).<br /><br />Having established that the small group environments of hundreds of thousands of years ago established instinctual loyalties that are more ontogenetic than phylogenetic in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 starts with a section on \\"Freedom and the Extended Order\\" (p. 29) which starts history with \\"So far as we know, the Mediterranean region was the first to seethe acceptance of a person's right to dispose over a recognized private domain, thus allowing individuals to develop a dense network of commercial relationships among different communities.\\"  (p. 29).  Hayek gave us no reason to suppose that he was thinking of drastic climate change when he wrote in Chapter 3, \\"Indeed, it will perhaps not be long before even Antarctica will enable miners to earn an ample living.  To an observer from space, this covering of the earth's surface, with the increasingly changing appearance that it wrought, might seem like an organic growth.  But it was no such thing:  it was accomplished by individuals following not instinctual demands but traditional customs and rules.\\"  (p. 43).<br /><br />Billions of people imply a lot more survival problems than anyone can think for, as President Woodrow Wilson discovered, or maybe died trying, sometime after the Great War, and Hayek is only going to provide support for anyone who is primarily interested in economic activity.  On a philosophical level, the most interesting thing about THE FATAL CONCEIT might be the charge of immorality on a theoretical level concerning Keynes, an intellectual opponent of Hayek, who is identified as \\"self-proclaimed `immoralists' such as Keynes\\" (p. 67) due to \\"his general belief in a management of the market order, on the ground that `in the long run we are all dead' (i.e., it does not matter what long-range damage we do; it is the present moment alone, the short run -- consisting of public opinion, demands, votes, and all the stuff and bribes of demagoguery -- which counts).\\"  (p. 57).  Television makes a superficial effort to keep people informed of major political issues, but, with even less awareness than economists exhibit of anything beyond the present moment, \\"is also a characteristic manifestation of an unwillingness to recognize that morals are concerned with effects in the long run -- effects beyond our possible perception -- and of a tendency to spurn the learnt discipline of the long view.\\"  (p. 57).<br /><br />Update for 2013, when I can read my own copy --<br /><br />Follow the trail of the thug mob (buy the bullet in the first verse).<br /><br />The reelection in 2012 of the Hey Joe political figure in the White House is the antichrist of all the reasons Jimi Hendrix and 28 Black Panthers were killed in and around 1970. Jimi Hendrix had been shaped by mob control of the music business so hit records could make money for the mob. If Jimi made $50,000 for a concert, $40,000 for his manager came out of Jimi's share. He had signed so many contracts when we wanted to be on his own in the music business that many powerful interest could keep him from getting money like he was a little kid. By 1970 he wanted to be able to play any music he liked and he was wasting so much studio time making tapes nobody was buying that his manager had no further way to profit from a black rock god packaged for white audiences.<br /><br />It has been over 48 years since the election which was supposed to matter the most for me before I could vote in 1964, when LBJ used the idea of a great society to paper over the kind of numbers racket that scum were reduced to in The Autobiography of Malcolm X because a large segment of society was frozen out by laws and crop eradication of the things Nietzsche and Freud would know about. The kind of economic exchange envisioned by Hayek was subject to government control like Ezra 9:11and12 so only the privileged would have an inheritance to provide their children. Hayek's discussion of The Philosopher's Blindness mentions Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas as adopted by the Roman Catholic Church for a condemnation of grab oxen for the benefit of more powerful people sitting on their asses with popular support.<br /><br />Austrian economics reminds me of Vienna and Berlin in Jane Fonda's movie Julia. The defenestration of socialist thinkers and the most important witness to what happened the night Jimi Hendrix died, like the fatwa death sentences that have been the mark on Salman Rushdie since 1989 (I'm sure some translator of The Satanic Verses was killed) could also spring from Ezra 9:11-12 as described by Hayek:<br /><br />The anti-commercial attitude of the mediaeval and early modern<br />church, condemnation of interest as usury,<br />its teaching of the just price,<br />and its contemporary treatment of gain<br />is Aristotelian through and through. (p. 47).<br /><br />Hayek's discussion of Marginal Utility starting on page 94 establishes that no absolute values exist in a system based on:<br /><br />Economic value expresses changing degrees<br />of the capacity of things to satisfy some<br />of the multiplicity of separate, individual scales of ends. (p. 95).<br /><br />The idea that government can freeze spending by building a capacity to assert stop*or*I'll*shoot when the original funding scheme gets to a bisexual financial transition stage for money that has already been spent can no longer apply to people who will not be your fool.learnt discipline of the long view.\\"  (p. 57).<br /><br />Update for 2013, when I can read my own copy --<br /><br />Follow the trail of the thug mob (buy the bullet in the first verse).<br /><br />The reelection in 2012 of the Hey Joe political figure in the White House is the antichrist of all the reasons Jimi Hendrix and 28 Black Panthers were killed in and around 1970.

McElheny, the author of WATSON AND DNA, worked under Watson at Cold Spring Harbor on the north shore of Long Island, New York, as director of Banbury Center from 1978 to 1982, organizing conferences on environmental sources of cancer.  This did not attract much money.  Support from the National Cancer Institute \\"took the form of book purchases.\\"  (p. 175).  Industry had to provide funding when deficits became severe, but Watson was willing to provide credit for others when money came in.  \\"Watson said that a conference on patenting life forms that I staged in 1981 had opened the way to the $7.5 million research cooperation between CSHL and Exxon.\\"  (p. 176).  There is a site map of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on page 173, and I needed to page through the book to find it, since there is no list of illustrations.  Page 58 showing DNA DOUBLE HELIX and FOUR BASES AS BASE PAIRS OF DNA is a schematic from MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL by Bruce Alberts et al.  An X-ray image of DNA made by Rosalind Franklin in May 1952 is shown on the third page of photographs following page 178.<br />The twentieth century produced some individual thinkers, and in scientific research those who were determined to be the first to provide an answer were seen by experts who had patiently acquired their knowledge as aspiring upstarts.  Anyone who could help them was likely to be like Erwin Chargaff, when Francis Crick \\"forgot which base was which.  He did not know which bases had NH[subscript]2, amino groups.  You could always look these up in a book!  Chargaff drew the formulas for the two smart alecks.  They were so ignorant.  He recalled, `I never met two men who knew so little and aspired to so much.'  They talked a lot about the `pitch' of the bases with respect to the long axis of DNA.  After the humiliating interview, Chargaff jotted a note:  `two pitchmen in search of a helix.'  He was not in a hurry to find the DNA structure.  Watson and Crick's ambition, and their worry about Pauling's beating them to the structure, left Chargaff cold.\\"  (p. 48).<br />One of the keys to the structure was that \\"It possessed a type of symmetry called `monoclinic C2,' which specified that the two helical chains ran in opposite directions. . . . In ten turns, then, the rung-like pairs of bases would be repeated, implying a rotation of 36 degrees from one base pair to the next.\\"  (p. 55).  It took a long time to get the proper form of molecules for the basic structure, with NH[subscript]2 instead of NH groups.  Watson was working with \\"enol\\" forms instead of \\"keto\\" until the fourth week of February, 1953, when Jerry Donahue convinced Watson which shapes were basic.  \\"The particular tautomeric form governed which hydrogen bonds could form between bases.  With enol, it wouldn't work.  With keto it would.  Donohue's intervention was vital.\\"  (p. 56).<br />The number of people working in molecular biology has increased so much since the basic elements of the field were figured out in this fashion that readers of this book are unlikely to achieve the fame acquired by many of the people this book describes.  Few will have the opportunity to go \\"to Fort Detrick, Maryland, the heavily guarded enclave where the military tried to make biological weapons out of deadly pathogens, and soon found that, as Watson said, `there was nothing good to tell the President.'  The pathogens were useless in a superpower conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, each with thousands of nuclear warheads.\\"  (p. 216).  Ultimately, \\"Said Watson, `You can't imagine them banning anything they thought would work.' \\"  (p. 217).  This book does not reach the point of trying to find WMD so we can ban them all over again, in places we sold them to after \\"Watson's Harvard colleague Matthew Meselson helped convince President Nixon to stop the work and destroy supplies.\\"  (p. 217).<br />Consider this book an investment in our future that will cost you much less than Exxon was willing to pay to learn how to patent life forms.ng to pay to learn how to patent life forms.	2003-09-01

TAKING DARWIN SERIOUSLY by Michael Ruse, a philosophical look at natural selection at the borderline of chimpanzees and humans, both of which must have started with some forms of adaptation that produced science and logic, which are now much easier to see in the humans, keeps returning to the desire to find that science was a result of epigenetic rules.  The philosophy sought as a support for science and morality clings to respectability in the face of the outrageous absurdity which is typical of sit-com situations and modern life.  Since Popper produced the idea in 1959, 1962, that \\"a genuinely scientific theory must expose itself to the real world.  It must be falsifiable\\" (p. 151), the world has provided impressive support for the comic supposition that we have probably been wrong about everything so far, whenever stupidity is rapidly gaining ground, and we have plenty to laugh about with good reason.<br />There is some informative material on Kant, a philosopher not known for comedy.  \\"This was the nub of Kant's so-called `Copernican revolution' in philosophy.  The mind does not passively receive knowledge.  It actively participates in its creation.\\"  (p. 179).  Throughout the book, credit is given to whatever cultural accomplishments of our biological ancestors produced the ultimate survival of a bipedal big-brain species such as we are, which must be the result of superior adaptation to the conditions of existence.  Like Kant, who once investigated fantastic stories about Swedenborg, being familiar with the common form of religion as it is practiced by his contemporaries is no barrier to the thoughts of Michael Ruse in trying to figure out how people have become far more successful than we might otherwise have been.<br />Taking a thoroughly modern view, the book of Job in the Bible is summarized in terms we should understand.  \\"A happy and successful businessman is tormented by one misfortune after another, and none of it of his own making.  Why did not Job curse God, which would have certainly been the rational thing to do?  Because, as the astute author of the Book knew full well, when things go wrong you need something to help you go on living (literally).  And if that something is belief in a supreme being, then so be it, even though such belief may be blatantly anti-scientific.\\"  (p. 177).  The Prologue of the Book of Job tells us that the fire of God fell from heaven and burned up his sheep and shepherds, but it also gives us, as readers, a basis for blaming Job's troubles on Satan, the Sabaeans who stole his oxen and donkeys, and the Chaldaeans who raided his camels.  TAKING DARWIN SERIOUSLY was published in 1986, a year in which Libya was condemned by our global superpower for terrorism on a scale that would have been as annoying to Job, but not quite on the scale of what finally happened on September 11, 2001, when religious fanatics were a major force (using airplanes instead of a gale) directed against great wealth precisely like Job 1:19:  \\"when suddenly from the wilderness a gale sprang up, and it battered all four corners of the house which fell in on the young people.  They are dead:  I alone escaped to tell you.\\"  In 2003, news is often about bombs which have shown the same antipathy and effect on buildings, buses, and military vehicles, in a manner which reflects Job 3:8:  \\"Let them curse it who curse the day, who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.\\"  Back before we had a settled order, cursing was a common experience of those who were not settled, and, as THE JERUSALEM BIBLE explains, Leviathan was \\"The dragon of primeval chaos; he might be roused by a curse against the existing order.\\"<br />There is not much on destruction in TAKING DARWIN SERIOUSLY, and the attention to philosophy is directed mainly to supporting a scientific conception of rules which work, as opposed to techniques which might end all life as we know it.  Reproduction and sex are not listed in the index, which is mostly last name, firstinitial, though \\"Creation-science\\" is listed to make sure that no one misses the arguments against it.  \\"Note also, incidentally, how frequently devotees of non-science defend their beliefs and practices by reference to supposed principles of science, real and apparent.  Astrologers claim to be more scientific than astronomers, chiropractors more scientific than doctors, and Creationists more scientific than evolutionists (Gish, 1972).  Rationality is important to us all, no matter how strong may be the call of other forces.  (Although Creation-science was developed as a political ploy, I am sure its devotees think it is genuinely scientific).\\"  (p. 178).<br />What humankind has shown most abundantly is a desire to make the rules, whatever form the rules might take in a particular setting.  Calling Job a businessman might be appropriate for a scholarly milieu in which business is expected to employ most of the students when they graduate, and business is the primary source of research contracts and grants for expansion.  Michael Ruse finds much more progress (trying to reach an explicit goal) in science, our ability to understand the basic situation which we face in the universe, than in the success produced by random, gradual changes produced by selection of naturally occurring genetic variety.  I continue to think that Darwin was willing to show that sex could be considered a major factor in selection of whose gene pool would be reproduced in each generation, but Michael Ruse might be more traditional in thinking that morality is the major factor limiting sex, and upper crust in thinking that sex is the major selection mechanism likely to produce a future in which humankind could be much less scientific than we are today.  We will certainly be much less scientific than we could be, but our cursing might become better, for all that.initial, though \\"Creation-science\\" is listed to make sure that no one misses the arguments against it.  \\"Note also, incidentally, how frequently devotees of non-science defend their beliefs and practices by reference to supposed principles of science, real and apparent.

The small paperback version that I have with an Introduction by Eliseo Vivas, published by Regnery/Gateway, Inc. in 1965, was actually translated by James W. Hillesheim and Malcolm R. Simpson, with the help of Carl H. Hamburg, Department of Philosophy, Tulane University.  The introduction quotes Nietzsche on how ideal education, made possible by someone with Schopenhauer's wisdom, is not merely training or inane indoctrination.  \\"Education is rather liberation, a rooting out of all weeds, rubbish and vermin from around the buds of the plants, a radiation of light and warmth, . . .\\" (p. xviii).  Eliseo Vivas must have looked long and hard to find anything so flowery in the works of Nietzsche, and applying such thoughts to Schopenhauer could \\"be open to a charge of irresponsibility,\\" (p. vii), as the first sentence of his introduction admits.<br />There is a Chapter IV in this book, beginning on page 34, which has, in the middle of the chapter, a distinctive quotation from Goethe, of Jarno addressing Wilhelm Meister, which is easy to locate in the other translations which I have.  I am interested in the paragraph following the quotation for a clue about the main emotions underlying philosophy.<br />\\"Thus, to be quite frank, it is necessary for us to get really angry for once in order for things to improve.  And the image of Schopenhauerian man gives us courage for this.  The Schopenhauerian man voluntarily takes the pain of truthfulness upon himself, and this suffering serves to kill his individual will to prepare that complete revolution and reversal of his being, the attainment of which is the actual meaning of life.  This assertion of the truth appears to other people as a sign of malice, for they look upon the preservation of their imperfections and pretenses as a duty of humanity and think that anyone must be malicious to break up their childish games in this way.  They are tempted to call out . . .\\"  (pp. 43-44).  A few pages later, still in the same paragraph, \\"He tortures himself and sees how no one else tortures himself in such a way, how rather the hands of his fellow men are passionately stretched out after the fantastic events on the political stage, or how they themselves strut about in a hundred masks, as youths, men, old men, fathers, citizens, priests, officials and merchants, thinking only of the comedy they are playing and not at all of their selves.\\"  (pp. 46-47).<br />My copy of J. R. Hollingdale's translation of UNTIMELY MEDITATIONS, with an Introduction by J. P. Stern (1983, reprinted 1989) does not have an index, and the Glossary of Names at the end of the book does not include Goethe, though \\"The man of Goethe\\" (p. 151) is a major topic in Chapter 4 of SCHOPENHAUER AS EDUCATOR.  Goethe, Rousseau, Faust, Mephistopheles, and the Devil are names that fill the paragraph in which Jarno is quoted as telling Wilhelm Meister:  \\"You are vexed and bitter, that is very good; if only you would get really angry for once it would be even better.\\" [In WILHELM MEISTERS LEHRJAHRE (1795-6), Book 8.]  (UM p. 152).  Hollingdale's translation of the next paragraph begins with:<br />\\"Thus, to speak frankly:  it is necessary for us to get really angry for once in order that things shall get better.  And to encourage us to that we have the Schopenhauerean image of man.  The Schopenhauerean man voluntarily takes upon himself the suffering involved in being truthful, and this suffering serves to destroy his own willfulness . . .\\"  (UM, p. 152)  The part of that paragraph, \\"or how they strut about in a hundred masquerades, as youths, men, greybeards, fathers, citizens, priests, officials, merchants, mindful solely of their comedy and not at all of themselves.\\" is on pages 154-155.<br />UNFASHIONABLE OBSERVATIONS, Translated, with an Afterword, by Richard T. Gray(Stanford University Press, 1995), was published as volume 2 of THE COMPLETE WORKS OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, Edited by Ernst Behler.  The paragraph quoted above runs from line 13 on page 203 to line 17 on page 207, which is the end of Chapter 4.<br />\\"Thus, to be quite frank, it is necessary for us to get really angry for once in order for things to get better.

Living in London, she is well aware of the chaos which results when a government attempts to try one approach, then another.  In the case of trains, her chapter on Infrastructure starts with the trains used by \\"a Briton, a formerly publicly owned, then privatized national rail system appears to have brought the worst of both worlds.  It seems to offer the certainty of delay and disruption together with the alarmingly high risk of death in an accident, all at high prices, and there is a vigorous debate as to whether it should be renationalized.\\"  (p. 50).  The question, \\"How old is it?\\" is not the key to the confusion about items which are \\"a subject of perpetual electoral dispute.\\"  (p. 51).  The whole world is old enough to break down, but economics keeps looking in the other direction.<br />This book is so modern, there is no doubt about who the author is or who she lives with.  A ten-year-old member of the family is likely to puzzle out situations as well as more professional people in her life.  The danger of earning a lot early in life, particularly in a life of crime, is described as a problem for people with short expectations:  banking with too much excitement is common for \\"workers with careers that will probably not last very long, such as sports stars or dancers or perhaps bond salesmen, with a pay structure that gives them high earnings but for a relatively short period.\\"  (p. 5)  On a psychological level, I thought that some humor could be found in her link of men, \\"only half of humanity,\\" (p. 7) whose \\"spending on the sex industry is rising faster than incomes overall.\\"  (p. 7).  Economically, we expect \\"the big growth will come in markets where demand is growing even faster than incomes as we become more and more prosperous.\\"  (p. 7).  We tend to exhibit \\"behavioral economics\\"  (p. 18).  \\"While people as a whole are pretty bad at figuring out risks realistically, teenagers, like some middle-aged men, are more willing to take risks.  Adolescents are trying to shape their independent identities as part of the transition to adulthood, and anybody in the throes of a midlife crisis is in search of a fleeting reminder of youth.\\"  (p. 19).  Did I mention that the first two words of Chapter 2 are \\"Bill Clinton\\" ?  (p. 8).  Thoroughly modern times have trickle down attitudes that share farce with journalistic awareness in books like SEX, DRUGS & ECONOMICS, which is not \\"An Unconventional Introduction to Economics\\" in such a society, it is more like a guide to borderline and mainstream activities that make up a large part of the variety features in daily newspapers.<br />Seriously though, we should all be aware that transportation problems in Afghanistan prevent farmers in certain regions from obtaining cash for any product except the paste from opium poppies, and portions of the world are understood most easily if the free world capitalist bets are considered off, and bombers at all altitudes are going to determine what remains standing in areas that were previously considered prosperous.  It is my understanding that the American Pentagon has been repaired, though this book notes that \\"Worldwide military spending fell from 3.6 percent of global GDP in 1990 to 2.4 percent in 1999, although the decline was concentrated in the industrialized and post-communist countries. . . . The worldwide peace dividend for 1999 may have been as much as [money amount]to [money amount].\\"  (p. 181).  Comparisons in this book could be to the worldwide market for illegal drugs.  \\"One widely accepted United Nations figure is [money maount](bigger than the global oil industry), employing around 20 million people and serving 70 to 100 million customers.  Perhaps half of the customers are in the United States, the biggest single market for drugs, as indeed for everything else.\\"  (p. 10).  As everything else faces declining profits, due to a lack of excitement and \\"heavy debt burdens,\\" (p. 10), expect \\"a substantial increase in drug production by developing countries\\" (p. 11) and I am expecting more U. S. military interest in \\"Columbia, Burma, or Afghanistan--although whether that is a cause or a consequence of the drug trade is not clear.\\"  (p. 11).  The Taliban are coming back, too, though I did not find them in this book, which makes no attempt to appeal to people who support Taliban policies.<br />A unique aspect of this book is the attempt to treat tobacco settlement money due to the states as a tax in Chapter 10, Tax Incidence:  Only People Pay Tax.  \\"In a piece of deliberate obfuscation, what amounts to a new national tax increase of about [money amount]on a pack of cigarettes\\" is being paid to states which sued the tobacco companies, \\"imposing an apparently staggering [money amount]bill on the cigarette makers,\\" in a deal worked out with lawyers getting payments estimated to have a present value of [money amount].

US	44184384	RE4J6XTSX8X7R	0226320618	688914972	The Road to Serfdom: Fiftieth Anniversary Edition	Books	3	5	39	N	N	Old intellectual political harangue	The vast majority of people, a long time ago, were serfs.  Those who are rich still get richer, but those who lived in California knew they could never pay enough property taxes to keep their government solvent.  In a war, with frequent incidents of destruction, political logic is easily portrayed as perverse.  THE ROAD TO SERFDOM by F. A. Hayek was published in 1944, and its history up to the fiftieth anniversary is well summarized in the Introduction by Milton Friedman and Prefaces by F. A. Hayek that are included in the 1994 paperback.  Due to new modes of triumph, some people have great expectations, but THE ROAD TO SERFDOM is about modern economic development leading to the stagnation of socialism.  Military measures are a topic of concern in Chapter 9, Security and Freedom.  The author's knowledge of Europe, where he was born and raised, prompted him to follow such considerations with Chapter 10, Why the Worst Get on Top, in which it is written:  \\"In the Central European countries the socialist parties had familiarized the masses with political organizations of a semi-military character designed to absorb as much as possible of the private life of the members.  All that was wanted to give one group overwhelming power was to carry the same principle somewhat further, to seek strength not in the assured votes of huge numbers at occasional elections but in the absolute and unreserved support of a smaller but more thoroughly organized body.\\"  (p. 151).  Television hardly seems to be as threatening, no matter how weirdly the news and entertainment mix and match, but combined with the courts, the major political parties, and the American electoral college in 2000, it largely seemed to support the imposition of a geopolitical superpower over the rest of the world, comparable to what Europe experienced when Hitler showed, \\"The chance of imposing a totalitarian regime on a whole people depends on the leader's first collecting round him a group which is prepared voluntarily to submit to that totalitarian discipline which they are to impose by force upon the rest.\\"  (p. 151).<br />Hayek was writing far too early to consider television, but his book has an antiquated view of the role of law which seems to me absurdly scholarly.  There is a big difference between legal training (his degree from the University of Vienna) and legal practice, mostly related to deals that involve real money.  Hayek writes about privilege without referring to attorney-client privilege, a consideration which makes most lawyers reluctant to discuss fraud by the officers of any corporation that has ever hired a firm that pays its lawyers to do legal work with the usual great degree of confidentiality assumed by those who expect to get paid.  Unexpected massive losses, no matter how likely in volatile times, don't get any consideration, even in this book.  Hayek is more concerned about people who are granted privileges by a government which expects them to perform a task that others will not be allowed to do.<br />Assume that for Hayek, \\"liberalism\\" means that no one is entitled to such privileges, which were standard in a feudal society, and could be blamed for the position of the serfs in such kingdoms, and interpret for yourself what he meant in 1944 when he wrote, \\"Because of the growing impatience with the slow advance of liberal policy, the just impatience with those who used liberal phraseology in defense of antisocial privileges, and the boundless ambition seemingly justified by the material improvements already achieved, it came to pass that toward the turn of the century the belief in the basic tenets of liberalism was more and more relinquished.\\"  (p. 23).  The turn of the century in 1900 was a time of restless thinking, when \\"the hope of the new generation came to be centered on something completely new, interest in and understanding of the functioning of the existing society rapidly declined; and, with the decline of the understanding of the wayin which the free system worked, our awareness of what depended on its existence also decreased.\\"  (pp. 23-24).  Financial speculation within the United States might have replaced manufacturing as the hope for the future, with an internet economy offering personal connections to whatever turned on the consumer becoming the ultimate shopping system for intimate personal interactions, by the year 2000, but on an individual level, each worker was assumed to have a financial interest in the Social Security system, with its lockbox for U.S. government bonds purchased with a portion of earnings and employers' contributions.<br />Defining the serfs, Hayek wrote, \\"It would indeed be privilege if, for example, as has sometimes been the case in the past, landed property were reserved to members of the nobility.  And it is privilege if, as is true in our time, the right to produce or sell particular things is reserved to particular people designated by authority.  But to call private property as such, which all can acquire under the same rules, a privilege, because only some succeed in acquiring it, is depriving the word `privilege' of its meaning.\\"  (p. 89).  Hayek was writing long before anyone thought of a lockbox protecting social security benefits, but it is easy to see Hayek's exasperation with guaranteed incomes putting everyone on the downhill path.  \\"Within the market system, security can be granted to particular groups only by the kind of planning known as restrictionism (which includes, however, almost all the planning which is actually practiced!).\\"  (pp. 141-142).  The biggest fraud to be guarded against is the devaluation of the lockbox by an utter collapse of fiscal discipline, recently observed in Argentina, suspected in the unbalanced budget of California, and bound to be worse in our future, but this is most likely, given the level of utter frustration with the economy we are rapidly approaching.in which the free system worked, our awareness of what depended on its existence also decreased.\\"  (pp. 23-24).

THE WILL TO POWER collected items from Nietzsche's notebooks that reflected the relationship between society and thought. Sections 925 and 926, written in 1888 and 1887 or 1888, mention John Stuart Mill, the golden rule, and Nietzsche's personal objection to the attempt to generalize morality for a great mass of individuals. \\"I abhor his vulgarity, which says: `What is right for one is fair for another'; `what you would not, etc., no not unto others'; which wants to establish all human intercourse on the basis of mutual services, so that every action appears as a kind of payment for something done to us.\\" (p. 489).<br />Section 925 calls J. S. Mill's kind of thinking \\"the instinct of the herd that finds its formula in this rule--one is equal, one takes oneself for equal: as I to you, thus you to me.\\" In Section 926 Nietzsche claims that each individual \\"is something unique and does only unique things.\\" Nietzsche is considered an aristocratic thinker because he explicitly separates himself from the masses to produce thoughts of his own. His thinking is \\"the cause of aristocratic segregation from the masses, because the masses believe in `equality' and consequently in equivalence and `reciprocity.'\\" Back in Section 744, Nietzsche disparaged philosophy about such things as \\"A science that, like all moral science, has not even reached the cradle yet!\\" (p. 394). As an example of how things really stand, section 745 is a short aphorism.<br />\\"An old Chinese said he had heard that when empires were doomed they had many laws.\\"	2003-08-13
US	44184384	RV3GNIZ2RW87Z	0803938624	410109634	Three Faces of Power	Books	3	6	25	N	N	A liberal genius trip	Kenneth E. Boulding did not just write this book. He also used it as a text for an evening course which contained a large number of adult students (\\"More than half the students had fulltime jobs in a great variety of fields\\" p. 258), and he asked each student to review the book. Fall of 1989 was such a modern time, most of them were subject to \\"the very act of thinking about power in our lives and experiences creates a process of revelation and self-analysis that may even make us look at ourselves in a new light. The internal search for the way in which the various forms of power have been exercised by a person and upon a person may have effects resembling a mild psychoanalysis.\\" (p. 259). Though this book does not suggest that anyone should try to write a review before reading the book, a comment, \\"we miss a great opportunity in our teaching by not encouraging students to read--and write--reviews, which sometimes save us the time it would take to read the book.\\" (p. 260). I have often spent more time reading a book than writing a review, but the larger share of my time has been devoted to ranting and raving about power issues on which I have firmly made up my mind, and my surprise that others are not in the same boat, on the same trip.<br />Threats are considered in a Chapter on \\"Organizations for Destruction,\\" justified mainly as \\"a counterthreat strategy--`You do something nasty to me and I will do something nasty to you.' The legitimacy of national military organizations in recent decades has come to rest much more on the claim that they ensure the defense of existing structures than on claims of conquest and empire.\\" (p. 145). Written long before a plane crashed into the pentagon on September 11, 2001, this approach did not rule out that police tactics would be nasty about any organization's assets if some money from those organizations had ever been used to support certain aliens in the United States in violation of some identity or immigration limitations. For those who suddenly find themselves involved, this might be described as a whole new ball game, hardly like \\"Saint Paul, after all, although a Jew, was a Roman citizen and free to travel all over the Roman empire. No doubt he paid taxes to it. This partial submission to the Roman threat system is one reason why the Christian church survived and grew.\\" (p. 144).<br />The irony in this book is mainly between the lines. I expect that organizations which continue to conform to their expectations have a tremendous advantage over the surprise produced by the bankruptcy of Enron, which produced the shocked reaction that anyone who pretended to be so rich and powerful could safely be stripped and left for dead as soon as it started to shred any documents that were likely to show that someone had been fooling people. THE THREE FACES OF POWER is not called *The Three Faces of Richard M. Nixon* and does not (he was still living when the book was written) even mention him three times, though the one time in Chapter 7, Personal Integrative Power, in a section on \\"Social Change Dominated by the Dynamics of Legitimacy\\" might be enough for the vultures who view disgrace primarily for its entertainment value to be satisfied. Lo and behold, \\"He transgressed the expectations of presidential behavior in the Watergate case and had to resign. . . . A scandal may result in the loss of integrative power on the part of the perpetrator, but what constitutes the scandal depends very much on the history, the norms, and the legitimacy structure of a society. I myself have lived through the virtual collapse of the legitimacy of political empire; the strong but not complete collapse of racism and sexism; a noticeable erosion of the legitimacy of centrally planned economies, although by no means their collapse; and some subtle erosion in the legitimacy of the military.\\" (pp. 113-114).<br />The tricky thing is how fast these rules changed after September 11, 2001, with a quick stop in Afghanistanand a presidential \\"State of the Union\\" speech about a government which employed professional torturers and rapists before the perpetual sexism of Middle Eastern society was confronted in Iraq, where the fear of an increase in the number of rapes is keeping women in their homes far more than was expected before the American liberation of Iraqi society from government domination. We are rapidly approaching \\"Every human being is different, every network is different, and it is not easy to formulate a simple model that applies to all cases.\\" (p. 114).<br />The goal with which this book was started in 1989, of providing a framework for thinking about things which have moved philosophers, but which philosophers have largely failed to control whenever they have tried, Plato to Heidegger being a trip similar to many others, is most unsettling in our future (2003 being my own personal hang-up at the moment) when even the items of common sense which it contains have been disregarded by anyone exercising authority for a short period of time, as anyone in a democracy may, if they are willing to take orders themselves. I might not know enough to read this book. A comparison of similar nations, Australia and Argentina, ends with Argentina in an economically disadvantaged position due to \\"the tradition of revolutionary violence and militarization in Argentina, which Australia somehow escaped, at least internally. There was, of course, the catastrophe of Gallipoli, a human sacrifice almost parallel to that of the Aztecs, but a long way off.\\" (p. 151). I'm guessing \\"a long way off\\" means just on the other side of Turkey from Iraq.

US	44184384	RBMLTTZ55547J	0306806703	582351486	Franz Kafka	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Written before he was so famous	Those of us who feel that Mozart might have been right, when he complained to his father about having to give music lessons for enough money to live, will find Max Brod entirely on our side in FRANZ KAFKA, A BIOGRAPHY, when it comes to &quot;Philistines who are of the opinion that it is enough if genius has `a few hours free'--they don't understand that all the available hours barely suffice to guarantee to an even tolerably uninterrupted ebb and flow of inspiration and repose its right and proper far-flung arc of oscillation.&quot;  (pp. 88-89).  Kafka obtained a doctorate in jurisprudence on July 18, 1906, did a year of unpaid practice in the law courts typical for those who intend to be called to the bar, and tried to find a job with office hours that would be through at 2 p.m. each day.  In July 1908, he began working at the Workers' Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia in Prague.  Work is tiring, so &quot;Kafka tried sleeping in the afternoon and writing at night.  That always went all right for a certain length of time, but he was not getting his proper sleep.&quot;  (p. 80).  With television providing entertainment at all hours, and people eating enough to produce sleep apnea to wake them constantly for another gasp of breath after we are too fat to sleep normally, it is not surprising that people find themselves in a state of mind which matches whatever Kafka was writing.<br />I checked a few biographies to see how much emphasis had been given to Kafka's work on the job, since reading recently in a book by Peter Drucker that Kafka does not get enough credit for requiring people in the presence of falling objects to wear safety helmets.  Max Brod had been a friend of Kafka in school, and worked for years in the post office while writing a book, so he was doubly aware of Kafka's attitude toward his work, because he allowed Kafka's feelings to determine his own occupation until he could no longer stand &quot;Suffering that has been raised to a degree that can only be described as fantastic.&quot;  (p. 81).  Brod quotes a letter in which Kafka's attempt to describe his work is comical.<br />&quot;people fall, as if they were drunk, off scaffolds and into machines, all the planks tip up, there are landslides everywhere, all the ladders slip, everything one puts up falls down and what one puts down one falls over oneself.&quot;  (p. 87).  When he was appointed a drafting clerk, all the new clerks had to listen to a member of the Board, who had &quot;given them a talk which was so solemn, and so full of fatherly sanctimoniousness, that he (Franz) had suddenly burst out laughing, and couldn't stop.  I helped the inconsolable Franz to write a letter of apology to the high official.&quot;  (p. 87).<br />By December 28, 1911, Kafka complains in his diary that, due to his family's share in a factory &quot;they made me promise to work there in the afternoons!&quot;  (pp. 89-90).  Max Brod thinks this mess is responsible for &quot;his later absorption into the world of sorrows that finally led to his illness and death. . . . but the disaster was essentially caused by the fact that a man so tremendously richly gifted, with such a rich creative urge, was forced just at the time when his youthful strength was unfolding himself, to work day in and day out to the point of exhaustion, doing things which inwardly didn't interest him in the least.&quot;  (p. 91).  This must be my favorite theme, in all of literature, that people are kept so busy, they would have to be fools to take the time to see what anyone else is doing.  Kafka wanted to be able to depend on others &quot;to keep everything running in the same good order as usual; for after all, we are men, not thieves.&quot;  (pp. 91-92).  This biography is written with the greatest friendly involvement in the life and death issues of its subject.  At the end, concerning a medical report on July 14, 1908, &quot;that Kafka, because of his affected nerves and `great cardiac irritability' had to give up his position&quot; (p. 248) it was only to be considered an excuse &quot;to transfer to the semi-government Accident Insurance Institute, where the work was considerably easier.&quot;  (p. 248).<br />This biography will be most meaningful to those who are familiar with Kafka's writings.  Many further items are also available.  &quot;Kafka's letters to Milena, her letters to me, and Janouch's recollections provide indispensable documentation for the period of Kafka's life in which THE CASTLE was being composed--documentation which is all the more important because Kafka's diary stops completely during the writing of the novel, and is relatively meager for the few years he had yet to live.&quot;  (pp. 221-222).<br />Chapter VII, The Last Years, has the beginning of Kafka's friendship with Dora Dymant in the summer of 1923.

The first chapter of that book is about Christopher Columbus, chapter 8 on Beethoven, chapter 12 on Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln, chapter 15 on Vincent van Gogh, chapter 16 on Friedrich Nietzsche, and chapter 20 on Adolf Hitler.  Anyone who reads it is sure to be astounded at how close Columbus, Nietzsche, and Hitler could be considered as possessing symptoms of the same disease.<br />THE POETRY OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE by Philip Grundlehner has a chapter on \\"New Lands,\\" in which a poem about Columbus is a major topic.  Nietzsche vaguely associated Columbus with sickness \\"In late November of 1881, for example, he wrote:  `Here in Genoa I am proud and happy--quite a \\"Doria magnate\\"--Or a Columbus? . . .  I need space--a great wide, unknown, unexplored world; otherwise I shall get sick of it all.' \\" (p. 120).  Back in Germany on September 9, 1882, he wrote to Franz Overbeck, \\"Everything that lies before me is new, and it will not be long before I catch sight also of the terrifying face of my more distant life task.\\"  (p. 129).  Two versions of the poem, \\"The New Columbus\\" from 1882 are translated on page 137, and the final three-stanza version of 1884 on page 138.  Columbus sometimes had trouble walking, but it is not clear how much Nietzsche actually knew about how disabled he was when Nietzsche wrote:<br />Let us stand firm on our feet!<br />Never can we go back!<br />Look forward:  from far away<br />One death, one fame, one happiness greet us!  (p. 138).<br />One of the early versions of \\"The New Columbus\\" was sent to Lou \\"as part of a dedication of a copy of THE GAY SCIENCE `to my dear Lou.' \\"  (p. 136).  Each version starts with a warning.  \\"Since the adventurer's fidelity must be to his spirit rather than to another person, a selfishness results that forbids any sharing relationship.  Nietzsche identifies this characteristic as a part of the Genoese heritage when he states in THE GAY SCIENCE that the people of this area are `overgrown with magnificent, insatiable lust for possessions and spoils.' \\"  (p. 139).  Grundlehner thinks that the use of the plural \\"we\\" and \\"us\\" in the last stanza is meant to include Lou.  \\"A probable explanation for this paradox lies in the confidence that Nietzsche gained in Lou Salome as an intimate who could accept the insecurities and dangers of the unknown and therefore participate in his vision.\\"  (p. 139).  That interpretation is more gentle than the idea that Nietzsche would be bound in chains and brought back to Spain, as Columbus was in 1499, for exceeding his authority by executing Spaniards \\"for insurrection against Columbus's rule,\\" as in the book, POX.  The officially available information about the health of Columbus was not available \\"until de Ybarra compiled it in 1894, [which] allowed later syphilologists to see a pattern of syphilis in Columbus's history.\\"  (POX, p. 11).  Whatever Nietzsche knew would have been by rumor, but the history of the Pox that was widely known included an epidemic in Naples, particularly among a French army which conquered it for a week in 1495, when the Pox became known as \\"Morbus Gallicus.\\"  (POX, p. 18).<br />Chapter 8 of THE POETRY OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE is called \\"Poetry as Pretension.\\"  (pp. 147-165).  The last line of the first stanza of \\"To Goethe\\" in the Appendix to THE GAY SCIENCE, as translated by Walter Kaufmann in 1974, was:<br />poetic pretension.<br />So it is not surprising to find the poem \\"To Goethe\\" discussed on pages 150-157.  The surprise is that the translation is so literal that it does not retain the poetic quality of Nietzsche's German or Kaufmann's English.  Instead,<br />is a poetic trick . . .<br />Walter Kaufmann might be assuming that anyone who had proceeded that far in THE GAY SCIENCE was familiar with all the terms that philosophers, poets, and great minds onthe order of Goethe and Nietzsche could use without being misunderstood.  My confusion was greatest on Kaufmann's use of the word, \\"ineluctable,\\" where THE POETRY OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE uses \\"deceitful\\" and, in its translation of the concluding \\"Chorus Mysticus\\" of Goethe's \\"Faust,\\" \\"inaccessible.\\"  (p. 151).  The best rhyme in the final stanza, of \\"the ruling force\\" with \\"the eternally fooling force\\" in Kaufmann, lacks \\"force\\" in THE POETRY OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, and the other rhyme in that stanza disappears completely with the use of a literal \\"being and appearance\\" instead of \\"false and true.\\"  You might learn a lot from this book, but people who are more interested in poetry than philosophy might be able to maintain the common prejudice that philosophers do not make very good poets.  But if you don't like to read much German, consider how likely it is that some of the German poetry in this book is top-notch, and can be compared to Goethe, as on pages 150-151.the order of Goethe and Nietzsche could use without being misunderstood.

Texts in this book do not appear in chronological order, with \\"Trickle-Down Greed\\" from January 1982 showing up on page 109, when the ideas of the rich, it can finally be admitted, \\"have gone a long way toward destroying the morale of the American people.\\"  If I really wanted a job, I might be much less willing to agree so wholeheartedly, as such political wishful thinking is becoming a major obstacle to intellectual forms of slavery for a living wage.<br />This book is a collection of articles from exciting (volatile) times, some when interest rates were high because of inflation, when it was easy to do a few calculations and show that the extra amount of interest being paid yearly on all debt \\"costs close to three times as much as the federal deficit the bankers moan about.\\"  With lower interest rates, \\"we'd be running a surplus, not a deficit.\\"  (p. 36).  In a perfect world, with a lower interest rate, we \\"would quickly and powerfully stimulate investment in productive enterprise, with a consequent growth in employment.  It would trigger a one-time surge in the stock and bond markets, followed by a gradual tapering off of speculation.\\"  (pp. 36-37).  Obviously right about the December 1988-January 1989 circumstances in which that projection was made, readers now can only wonder how stupid a vast speculative bubble based on the belief in a total change in the nature of the economy in the 1990s could seem in 2003, when the federal deficit grows at a time of incredibly low interest rates.  None of our problems are Brockway's fault, though he is still right about \\"The number of people living in poverty is growing, and within that group the number of those who work full time yet are poverty stricken is growing faster still.\\"  (p. 37).<br />Brockway was trying to look this far ahead.  \\"Well into the twenty-first century, for instance, we will be paying up to 15.75 percent interest on a trillion dollars' worth of Treasury bonds sold in the wonder-working days of former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker.\\"  (pp. 38-39).  This could have been part of a plan, and however stupid our current situation seems, one explanation could be that someone would like to produce a financial disaster so big that it will forever destroy the expectations of millions of people who could easily be deprived of everything by those who have the power to do so.  This book sure makes it seem like it could be part of a plan, like NAIRU:  the \\"nonaccelerating inflationary rate of unemployment.\\"  (p. 28).  Trying not to pick on anyone with a lot of power, Peter G. Peterson, President Nixon's secretary of commerce in 1972 (p. 57), is accused of being \\"a great sleight-of-hand artist.\\"  (p. 61).  \\"Finally, consider the aftertax income of the median families (this is where the wealthy shone like burnished gold).  In 1986 dollars it fell . . .  When you include the increase in Social Security taxes (largely engineered, as aforesaid, by Peterson), the fall was much greater.  In short, from 1977 to 1986, poverty was up a third; weekly earnings were down 10.4 percent; the median income was up 1.7 percent; but the after-tax income of the median family was down 5.3 percent.  And the after-tax incomes of the wealthy more than doubled.  This is what Peterson and his ilk are fighting for.\\"  (p. 62).<br />\\"Economists Can Be Bad for Your Health,\\"an article from December 1993, is about \\"The dense complexity of the Clinton plan, particularly all the stuff about managed competition, was intended to achieve\\" (p. 85) market discipline.  The same title might apply to a conference committee effort to produce drug benefits for elderly patients in 2003, if the Senate, House, Democrats, and Republicans who passed very different forms of economic inducement can bring market discipline up to date.  What Brockway calls \\"a beautifully apposite example\\" (p. 86) involving a drug used on sheep for \\"six cents a dose\\" (p. 87) was priced much higher after the Mayo Clinic, \\"conducted tests, at its own expense, then the Food and Drug Administration reviewed the findings and approved the drug for human use.\\"  The economic argument for Medicare coverage is \\"Medicare's loss ratio is in the 90s.  In other words, the market discipline imposed by competition among giant insurance companies costs the consumer at least 20 percent more than a government-run single-payer system.\\"  (p. 89).<br />\\"Starving All the Way from the Bank\\" is about how loans to Third World nations are in terrible trouble.  Based on the book, DEBT TRAP: RETHINKING THE LOGIC OF DEVELOPMENT by Richard Lombardi, Third World debt, $7.6 billion in 1960, was a trillion dollars in 1985, not likely to be paid off by \\"the notion that a growing GNP cures all ills.\\"  (p. 99).  Any attempts to produce money in areas where the people don't earn enough to sustain life are panning out as poorly as Export-Import Bank loans to \\"The national airlines of countries of fewer than a half million souls, most of them tribesmen . . . bought fleets of Boeing 747 jumbo jets.\\"  (p. 99).  Boeing and someone else got money in their pockets, not the tribesmen, but banks want that money now, too.an article from December 1993, is about \\"The dense complexity of the Clinton plan, particularly all the stuff about managed competition, was intended to achieve\\" (p. 85) market discipline.

US	44184384	RCTE53M7N69E5	019289322X	849373642	The Great Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy	Books	4	3	16	N	N	An educational series with some great issues	This book from 1987 was a result of a BBC television series in which living philosophers talked about the great philosophers, most of whom have been dead for a long time.  On questions like morality, it really isn't polite to question people the way Socrates did, upsetting them with abrupt confrontation in the hope of defeating superficialities to produce thought about how little we know about the things we can't define.  Plato, who was 31 when Socrates died from the hemlock in 399 BC, is the first philosopher to leave a series of books in which the ideas of Socrates combine with his own.  Plato also founded a school in Athens, and expected readers of his books to be familiar with what had previously been taught.  Television is the ultimately unlimited classroom in which two people discussing such ideas can be broadcast to those who want to be educated, and the book provides a format with an index, so those who wonder, later, what was said can look it up.<br />The first discussion in the book is about Plato, praises THE REPUBLIC as the book most responsible for philosophy's examination of the concept of justice, praises THEAETETUS for raising the question \\"What is knowledge?\\" in a way that knocks down the answers in Socratic style, forcing more thought about the issue than people have time for in real life, and calling that \\"a highly suitable response to this kind of dialogue.\\"  (p. 29).  Those who might want to be philosophers are sure to be inspired by such thoughtful responses, and could enjoy devoting themselves to the further development of philosophy contained in the rest of this book and all the written works it discussed.<br />People who read up to the Nietzsche discussion will find that life can be more tragic.  THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY \\"is concerned with pre-Socratic tragedy and with pre-Socratic Greece, which for him was a kind of golden age.  And the whole thing goes flat at the point when Euripides, Aristophanes and Socrates come on the scene.\\"  (p. 237).  Politics replaced drama, much as television turned from being an entertainment media to being the news center likely to be bombed by any global superpower that does not approve of what governments in control of their own stations are likely to say in their broadcasts.  Events which happened since 1987 are not contained in this book, which was written while Richard Nixon (19xx-1994) was still alive.  In 1974, Nixon resigned as President and told his staff, \\"My mother was a saint,\\" the kind of evaluation which powerful people can utter about the dead without fear of immediate and sustained contradiction, but serious questioners might wonder if she had any more insight than Socrates when it came to politics.<br />This book makes it easy to understand Socrates as Nixon understood his mother, but it fails to reflect how strongly political writers like I. F. Stone could be convinced that the execution of Socrates had more to do with the effects of civil war on politics in Athens after Socrates \\"taught others to think for themselves.\\"  The democratic majority in Athens was distraught at those who did not agree with them.  Intellectually, Socrates was the target for their anger that made the most sense.  Giving hemlock to Socrates was as just as the accidental bombing in May 1999 of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade might seem most inappropriate to journalists who were spending the night in the embassy because they didn't want to get killed for staying in the hotel which was bombed the same night.<br />War is only considered as a topic, briefly, in this book, and not as a context which determines what is, as opposed to what used to be.  Even the doctrine of just war is considered merely a balance between the feelings of pacifists, who consider war so wicked that each and every one ought to be condemned, and those who fall for \\"the only moral imperative is to win the war by the most effective means possible.\\"  (p. 72).  Thermonuclear weapons are likely to be used only by thosewho expect the total destruction of life on earth, since the philosophers have spoken.  \\"This medieval `just war' tradition lies behind two of the most significant contributions to the recent debate about nuclear weapons:  in Britain, the Church of England book THE CHURCH AND THE BOMB, and in the United States the Pastoral Letter of the American Catholic Bishops on Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Deterrence.\\"  (p. 72).  The word *debate* is the furthest possible choice of words from the reality.  Nuclear weapons have only been used as a secret project, and the use of the second atomic bomb was as secret as the first, as far as everyone in the world was concerned, except those who knew it was going to happen.<br />In the meantime, philosophy has turned into something that reflects the nature of war more than any other form of knowledge.  You might not be able to figure that out from this book.  A couple people talking about ultimate issues on television hardly seems like the catastrophic world in which disaster movies connect with audiences far more frequently than great art, music, or anything between the covers of books.  This book is highly educational about concepts that are educational, but don't be surprised to get past the middle of the book and still find thoughts like, \\"Right again.  Philosophers since Descartes had been trying to prove the existence of the external world.  Kant said it was a scandal that no one had successfully done it.\\"  (p. 261).who expect the total destruction of life on earth, since the philosophers have spoken.  \\"This medieval `just war' tradition lies behind two of the most significant contributions to the recent debate about nuclear weapons:  in Britain, the Church of England book THE CHURCH AND THE BOMB, and in the United States the Pastoral Letter of the American Catholic Bishops on Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Deterrence.\\"  (p. 72).

Much of the text is concerned with what doctors knew at certain points between 1492, when a large number of men who traveled with Christopher Columbus (who died in 1506) started raging epidemics of various diseases on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and 1948, when Adolf Hitler's doctors died.  The cause of death of everyone mentioned in the book is not included, but one of the doctors responsible for the information in the Military Intelligence Service Center Report, \\"Hitler as Seen by His Doctors,\\" \\"Brandt was executed on 2 June 1948 at Landsberg prison for his role in Hitler's euthanasia program.\\"  (p. 290).  The form of poetic justice involved in any consideration of the pox is similar to a poem of the early Greek general Archilochus, selection 184 in 7 GREEKS/ TRANSLATIONS BY GUY DAVENPORT, p. 55:<br />In the hospitality of war<br />We left them their dead<br />As a gift to remember us by.<br />In 1495, the French army of 18,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers for Charles VIII, king of France, took Naples, defended by Spanish troops and some women who came with them from Spain, but the people \\"expelled Charles within a week. . . .  Poor Charles was the first of many monarchs to fall prey to the disease.  Charles died of apoplexy three years later, at age twenty-eight, after hitting his head against the frame of a low door.\\"  (p. 13).  Spanish \\"soldiers expelled the women, who were cheerfully accepted by the French soldiers--an early example of germ warfare.\\"  (p. 14).<br />Hitler's heartbeat, heard through a stethoscope, had an extra musical note due to aortic weakness.  In 1875, a British army surgeon \\"found that about two-thirds of the records of fifty-three cases of rupturing aortic aneurysm had a previous history of syphilis.\\"  (p. 34).  Beethoven, (pp. 71-88), Schubert (pp. 89-96), and Schumann (pp. 97-111), then Hugo Wolf (1860-1903) whose \\"agonized tone\\" could be traced \\"to his infection,\\" (p. 314) get credit for setting the vibrations of their nerves to music.<br />Nietzsche, with a case that is well documented on pages 172-199 of this book, is the key philosopher for understanding the psychic link which bind the subjects of this book.  Jaspers and Jung are mentioned a few times, but Hayden can look directly at his work for evidence that \\"He thought of a future time when his work would be understood and appreciated.  In all these things we see a parallel with van Gogh during that same year.  Pure creative inspiration, mental illness, or paretic disinhibition:  whatever the combination, the result in each case was astonishing.\\"  (p. 199).<br />Many doctors knew what Nietzsche was suffering from, even if his mother and sister didn't know (p. 181) what he admitted when he was taken to \\"the nerve clinic of Dr. Wille, an expert on general paralysis of the insane,\\" (p. 174) in Basel in January, 1889.  Guy de Maupassant (1850-1893) was the rare author who told people, \\"I've got the Pox!\\"  (pp. 142, 144).  His story, \\"Bed Number 29\\" is summarized on page 145 of this book.  The victim in the story \\"was infected by the invading Prussians, but she got her revenge by passing her disease on to as many soldiers as possible. . . . she boasts that her score of deaths is greater than his.\\"  Deborah Hayden has done a tremendous amount of correlation of the information relating to the years from 1492 to 1948, but the psychic roots of much that she found is all too common, even though spirochetes did not provide a basis for the modern understanding of syphilis until they were discovered in 1905.<br />Recently in Science magazine (17 July 1998) the complete genome sequence of Treponema pallidum, the syphilis spirochete, was revealed to have 1,138,006 coding pairs containing 1,041 predicted coding sequences (Hayden, p. 26) but we still don't know everything.  \\"Existing diagnostic tests are less than optimal.  Even after treatment with penicillin some patients harbor spirochetes in `treponemal sanctuaries' such as the eye and the lymph glands.  Many of the details of its life cycle remain unanswered.\\"  (p. 27).<br />My favorite page 252, shows a young Hitler staring out of a picture in the top half of the page, then has, \\"In 1936 Hitler hired a syphilologist, Theo Morell, to be his private physician.\\"  By 1941, there is \\"a pattern of syphilis beginning with one of the most terrifying manifestations of late syphilis, disease of the heart.\\"  The main comedy of the book is the urban legend aspect, how many people relied on beliefs which had no scientific basis, which is not funny as it applies to modern HIV infections on page 45.  In Hitler's case, I think the funniest anecdote is related by Putzi Hanfstaengl, \\"who became Hitler's foreign press secretary\\" (p. 254) though \\"He ended up in Washington writing psychological profiles of Hitler and the Nazi inner circle for his old friend from the Harvard Club, Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\"  (p. 255).  The funny story was related by Putzi to Rudolph Binion \\"in the early 1970s\\" (p. 255) and elaborated in this book through page 256, when this book turns to \\"In Landsberg prison after the Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler wrote thirteen pages in MEIN KAMPF about syphilis being the direst threat to the future of the race,\\" based on the belief \\"that syphilis could be inherited for many generations.\\"  (p. 264).  In the syphilis epidemic after World War I, even Hitler had to wonder, \\"Finally, however:  who can know whether he is sick or healthy?  Are there not numerous cases in which a patient apparently cured relapses and causes frightful mischief without himself expecting it at first?\\"  (p. 264).  Please remember, \\"a glassblower with an infectious mucous patch in his mouth who infected a coworker when he passed a glassblowing pipe.\\"  (pp. 182-183).

Are there not numerous cases in which a patient apparently cured relapses and causes frightful mischief without himself expecting it at first?\\"  (p. 264).  Please remember, \\"a glassblower with an infectious mucous patch in his mouth who infected a coworker when he passed a glassblowing pipe.\\"  (pp. 182-183).

In Chapter 2, at the age of thirteen, he was already in training to be a great writer.  The first chapter ended with a paragraph describing his desire to battle the gods, &quot;the god of Stupidity,&quot; (p. 5), &quot;the god of Absolute Truth and Total Righteousness,&quot; (p. 5), &quot;the god of Mediocrity,&quot; (p. 6), &quot;the god of Acceptance and Servility,&quot; (p. 6) and &quot;other gods, less easy to unmask, shifty and shrouded in mystery;&quot; (p. 6), for whom &quot;my mother had been one of their favorite toys; they never left her in peace; from the snows of Russia to the shores of France, with her child in her arms, it was in vain that she tried to escape from them.&quot;  (pp. 6-7).  Romain Gary needed to defeat those gods and &quot;tear down the veil of darkness and absurdity concealing the true face of the universe.&quot;  (p. 7).<br />Published in 1961, this book has the kind of earth-shaking humor that formed the basis for THE DANCE OF GENGHIS COHN in 1967 (in French) and 1968 (English translation).  For all the chapters in PROMISE AT DAWN which are devoted to basking in maternal love, there are chapters in which people fail to show the same attention to him that his mother did.  Chapter 11, when he was nearly nine, starts with a description of Valentine, a lovely eight-year-old girl, whose first words to him seem to be, &quot;Janek ate his whole stamp collection for me.&quot;  (p. 70).  Such people must be doing the TV scripts of contest shows, as this kind of behavior seems to inspire some contagious reaction approaching insanity.  &quot;I ate for the lady one of my rubber galoshes.&quot;  (p. 70).  Curiously, she asked, &quot;Are you going to eat it raw?&quot;  (p. 72).  On a literary level, &quot;Twenty years later this puppy love inspired my first novel, A EUROPEAN EDUCATION, and also some passages in THE COMPANY OF MEN.&quot;  (p. 72).  There have been other things that Romain Gary has done in his life, but it is difficult to imagine that he could have done any of them better than writing books.my first novel, A EUROPEAN EDUCATION, and also some passages in THE COMPANY OF MEN.&quot;  (p. 72).

Economists primarily  serve planners, with whatever can promote the organizers of the technostructure who are looking for ways to expand their activity, usually in ways that produce private profit.  To produce examples of individual motivations, Galbraith mentions \\"Ditch-digging\\" (p. 81) and soon moves up, or down, depending on your point of view.  \\"But once again the ditch-digger is not the most powerful example.  The cabinet officer or high official who serves and on occasion concurs in action that he finds repugnant in order to advance measures of which he approves is a better case.  He came to be part of something approaching a majority of American officialdom as those involved in the Vietnam war came to explain why they went along.\\"  (p. 82).  A common form of ditch in Vietnam was a latrine, dug by soldiers because each of them was likely to need to use the latrine as much as the next G.I., and a place that had already been prepared next to a big pile of loose dirt, or a can under a simple crate with a large hole on top, was as luxurious an accommodation as any soldier could expect prior to being evacuated from Nam himself.  Digging the ditch was a pleasure, compared to the chore of burning what was in the can, but Nam was a situation that lasted so long, the Army needed to provide for human waste in a way that avoided unsanitary results from new troops coming in and digging up an area that had been the previous unit's latrine.<br />After a century of fantastic organizational growth, and fifty years of economics from Galbraith, it takes a tremendous amount of balancing contrary ideas to avoid the worst of what has gone before, in particular, the \\"cabinet officer or high official who serves and on occasion concurs in action that he finds repugnant.\\"  (p. 82).  \\"The Case for Social Balance\\" on pages 40-54 noted how, in times of economic growth that was highly profitable, industry salaries could rise faster than governments could keep up, and with high inflation, the revenues of cities \\"lag behind when prices rise.  The problem of financing services thus becomes increasingly acute as and when inflation continues.\\"  (p. 52).  Trying to balance public needs with the views of typical investors, \\"Urgent warnings were issued of the unfavorable effects of taxation on investment\\" (p, 53), Galbraith ends his balancing by trying to foist the higher sense of disorder on F. A. von Hayek, who wrote \\"Where distinction and rank is achieved almost exclusively by becoming a civil servant of the state . . . it is too much to expect that many will long prefer freedom to security.\\"  [THE ROAD TO SERFDOM, p. 98] (THE ESSENTIAL GALBRAITH, pp. 53-54).<br />Arguments tend to illustrate how primitive political positions are, and sending millions of individuals from America to Vietnam as members of the armed forces, supposedly to protect American interests in drilling for oil in the South China Sea, where oil reserves had not even been identified at the time, helped some of them to learn, \\"Compulsion is inconsistent with either identification or adaptation.  If a person is compelled to accept the goals of an organization, he is unlikely, at least as long as he is under the sense of compulsion, to find them superior to his own.\\"  (p. 83).  This does not resolve the situation in 2003, except for those lucky investors who check the news every day to see if the oil wells are still safe.<br />After everyone has absorbed \\"The Concept of the Conventional Wisdom,\\" (pp. 18-30) in a way that assumes a higher standard of living will be most highly regarded in our society, pursuant to \\"The Myth of Consumer Sovereignty,\\" the position of Galbraith as a thinker might be considered self-effacing in the extreme.  Once you see what he is saying about American society, the truer it is, the less likely a political movement which must appeal to voters with such values is to succeed in putting his point across.  Anyone who claims to represent the interests of the people, whether they are people of America, or peasants in Nam, or the people of Iraq, is quickly accused of being a fake with views that do not conform to reality in any corner of the globe.<br />If readers are looking for irony, allow me to point out the observation, common in 1987 prior to the crash of October 19, \\"Galbraith doesn't like to see people making money.\\" in \\"The Speculative Episode.\\" (p. 254).  Themes in THE ESSENTIAL GALBRAITH might be considered to be in the order followed by the economic cycle.  Near the end, \\"In Goldman, Sachs We Trust\\" is a selection from THE GREAT CRASH, 1929, which was published in 1955 \\"and is still in print today; on occasion it sells more than all my other books combined.

I might have read this book a long time ago, when Nicaragua was a political concern in the United States, as I remember the approach which Gunter Grass took to this problem in \\"Superpower Backyards,\\" written in 1982, with an English translation in \\"The Nation,\\" March 12, 1983.  After the Sandinistas had taken power in Nicaragua and Grass spent eight days there, he started his article with a Mexican saying, \\"My poor Mexico, how far you are from God, and how close to the United States!\\"  (p. 149).  Grass was born in Danzig in 1927, lived in West Berlin, and \\"Spiritually as well as geographically, I felt closer to the Solidarity movement in Poland.  Actually, as I see now, Solidarity and the Sandinistas have much in common.  Poland's fears of intervention by the Soviet Union have their counterpart in Nicaragua's fears of intervention by the United States.\\"  (p. 149).  In 2003, the geopolitical picture has changed in some places, the catastrophe which Russia would like to end in the area around Chechnya is much more persistent than the hijacked airplane attacks suffered in the United States on September 11, 2001, but there is still some fear of new attacks that signals a lingering intellectual connection between what is in this book and American intervention elsewhere in the world.<br />Flying into Managua with a layover in Miami gave Grass an opportunity to rent a car and look for \\"two of the training camps for Cuban exiles and Somocistas south of Miami Beach.  One of them was hidden behind mounds of garbage; the other was behind a fence with a metal sign on the gate reading \\"FBI area.\\"  The penalty for unauthorized entry is ten years in prison and a ten-thousand-dollar fine.\\"  (p. 152).  There might still be Cubans in training there, hoping to lead Cuba to democracy any year now, when the inevitable finally happens.  As recently as June 8, 2001, U.S. federal court sentenced five Cubans to 15 years and up to two life sentences for espionage for monitoring the actions of groups in Miami which have caused the deaths and injury of hundreds of people.  The last page of this book would inspire the German government to help Nicaragua develop its agriculture.  \\"Will the government in Bonn understand (and why not?) that if we help Nicaragua we help ourselves?  Or will it obey the wishes of the superpower-ally and get out the cudgel for Cuba--a familiar reaction which can club to death anything, not just the Sandinista revolution but also one's own thoughts?\\"  (p. 157).<br />The introduction by Salman Rushdie was written at least three years before Rushdie became the object of a million dollar reward, and long after Rushdie read THE TIN DRUM in the summer of 1967.  The state of mind of \\"exiles, refugees, migrants\\" (p. x) is called \\"a triple disruption:  he loses his place, he enters into an alien language, and he finds himself surrounded by beings whose social behavior and code is very unlike, and sometimes even offensive to, his own.\\"  (p. xi).<br />The first half of ON WRITING AND POLITICS is about what great authors have done.  Alfred Doblin, Thomas Mann, Bertold Brecht, Franz Kafka, and Schiller are mentioned on the road to a very modern understanding of \\"Schiller's purpose was to make the Thirty Years' War intelligible as a clearly structured whole.  One event followed from another.  His ordering hand disclosed relationships, looked for meaning.  More than once, Doblin deliberately smashes this whole construct to bits for the sake of reality.\\"  (p. 11).  \\"THE TIN DRUM in retrospect or The Author as Dubious Witness\\" (pp. 25-30) explains the author's great success, though \\"afterone night in the custody of the Paris police I was overcome by a positive longing for the West German police--we left Paris soon after THE TIN DRUM was published (and left me), and moved back to Berlin. . . . Since then I've found it harder to write.\\"  (p. 30).  The chapter \\"What Shall We Tell Our Children?\\" is on the great poet, Heine.  \\"Heine remains a stumbling block to the Germans.  His witty seriousness and laughing despair are beyond them.  I do not except myself, for when, soon after the end of the war, young and hungry for hitherto forbidden literature, I read Heine's `Rabbi of Bacherach' for the first time, . . .\\"  (p. 83).  As a writer, Grass sees the complicated side of complexity.  \\"The success of `popular' enlightenment has never been more than skin deep.  Demonstrably as television series\\" (p. 88) exhibit entertainment values, . . . \\"they are quite incapable of disclosing the complex `modernity' of genocide and the many-layered responsibilities at the root of it.

Later Grass confesses that in November 1938 \\"I was eleven years old and both a Hitler Youth and a practicing Catholic.\\"  (p. 89).  \\"I never, up to the beginning of the war, heard a single prayer in behalf of the persecuted Jews, but I joined in babbling a good many prayers for the victory of the German armies and the health of the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler.\\"  (pp. 89-90).  Now he can safely complain about \\"The many-faceted moral bankruptcy of the Christian West.\\"  (p. 90).one night in the custody of the Paris police I was overcome by a positive longing for the West German police--we left Paris soon after THE TIN DRUM was published (and left me), and moved back to Berlin. . . .

Fleet ready for loading at main hub\\" (p. 9) and other aspects of \\"the largest all-cargo air fleet in the world\\" (p. 9) that reinforce the feeling that everybody needs to have lots of money or this country's bankers won't be the only unhappy people in the world. In a *GO JET* world, the final picture, with a caption, \\"working to meet the needs of business throughout the world,\\" (on the page after 94), might even be uplifting after a text which urges, \\"People had better start to find their voice for the emerging debate\\" (p. 94) about regulating our financial institutions again, so this \\"Larger Agenda Series\\" text seems like a hardcover magazine with one long article at times. William Greider is still a top reporter on the state of the economy. THE TROUBLE WITH MONEY is mainly about the American economy. Written in 1989, when the dollar was incredibly strong due to high interest rates, which brought in the flood of foreign investments able to finance growing trade deficits and federal deficits by furnishing an increasingly speculative market for debt, banks were failing at record rates. The price of oil was too low for people with huge mortgages to pay their loans in Texas, while manufacturers paying workers American dollars suffered from a decreasing ability to sell their products in the rest of the world. I'm so stuck in 2003 now, only 14 years later, that complaining about anything in this book is like a drunken bat out for blood that dried up a long time ago. But I'm as upset over the current news about any predictions of improvement in the global economy, a constant hope of those who are looking for the next big spurt of growth that would prevent the kind of collapse that I will attempt to provide in a factual analysis of this book, though at this point, the effort is as much psychiatric anamnesis as the entertainment value of the question in the form of an offer: do you want to bet?<br />Every percent of something is different from a percent of something else, and this applies mainly to the U.S. Department of Commerce chart on page 70, \\"Inflation-Adjusted Interest Rates.\\" With a positive 4.42 percent in the 1980s, Greider thinks \\"the bloated interest rates of the 1980s were rivaled during only one other period in this century--the Roaring Twenties, when similarly distorted social values were in full play.\\" (p. 71). Those who check the numbers at the bottom of the chart will discover a whopping negative 5.13 percent for the 1940s, showing that lenders had little chance of getting their money back at the same value, as time was changing the situation greatly in favor of those who could use money productively. Today's interest rates might seem small to us, \\"but, historically, 0.35 percent represents a generous rate of real return on short-term T-bills.\\" (p. 70). These numbers were from \\"Alan Greenspan, the new Federal Reserve chairman, in the fall of 1988 provided the Senate banking committee with some stunning economic figures that, curiously, the press ignored. Greenspan's numbers described the bedrock reality of the 1980s and explained much about the turbulent era--the lopsided prosperity at the top, the periodic financial crises, the erosion of corporate balance sheets, and other unsettling developments . . . plainly about the true cost of money.\\" (p. 69). When the government needed money for World War II, \\"The Fed, in those years, kept nominal long-term rates at a steady, stable 2 percent, and federal deficits as a percentage of the gross national product then dwarfed the deficits of the Eighties.\\" (p. 71). Constantly comparing things to a drunken bat might not make our situation much clearer, but the federal deficit for the fiscal years ending in 2003 and 2004 might seem large when they are compared to the numbers which this book has preserved.<br />\\"The ingenious politicians had found a way to commit upward of $160 billion in public money to rescue the S&Ls--with only marginal impact on the reported federal deficit.\\" (p. 4)<br />\\"The New York Fed itself, for instance, served in 1986 as a clearinghouse for a daily flow of financial transactions exceeding $1 trillion . . .

US	44184384	R12I39UNPT8VX0	1882926846	165264273	J R R Tolkiens Sanctifying Myth: Understanding Middle Earth	Books	4	2	27	N	N	Catholic exhaulting faith in myth, very well too	This book is the most current attempt to ascend the intellectual height at which myth, or its meaning as it is currently understood, is documented with scholarly precision.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to save my ironic comments about errors in this book, in my own theological reactions, or in the world in which we unfortunately find ourselves, until the end of this review.  Catholics are used to being proud of what remains of their tradition, and for some readers, this book might seem to be part of a series of books in which Catholics become bolder in proclaiming their religious connections to the story of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, for which the 150,000,000 copies of the book circulating in many forms might be the other measure of its success.  Joseph Pearce is not afraid to jump from Tolkien to The Bible in the foreword of this book, but I think the Gospel of John in the New Testament is much more similar to a creation story in THE SILMARILLION in which Eru \\"made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought, and they were with him before aught else was made.\\"  (p. xi).  Unless this happened in a formless void and in the dark, this is not \\"a remarkable similarity to the creation story of the book of Genesis,\\" (p. xi), it is more like John 1:1-3.<br />To explain what is eating me about this book, I will start right in on the world.  In a society based entirely on entertainment values, that religion makes the most sense which creates the most empathy for the understanding of great character in the form of humility, with an involved myth about beastly tasks performed under duress as the content most endearing to the hearts of the sub-creating form of humanity.  Bradley J. Birzer's book, J. R. R. TOLKIEN'S SANCTIFYING MYTH has a foreword by Joseph Pearce, who was responsible for collecting the essays in TOLKIEN/ A CELEBRATION in 1999.  In that book, \\"Tolkien and the Catholic Literary Revival\\" was a lengthy selection by Joseph Pearce in the middle of the book.  Walter Hooper's explanation of \\"one of Tolkien's most important literary theories -- that of `sub-creation' which he wrote about in his essay `On Fairy Stories' \\" (p. 187) was near the end of that book.  \\"Modernity in Middle-Earth\\" by Patrick Curry on pages 34-39 of Pearce's book already raised the issue of secularization in our time being the process by which we see \\"any ultimate values denied beyond the bread and circuses of instrumental knowledge, material consumption and sensational entertainment.\\"  Modernity, for Tolkien and these authors, means the grave dangers we face \\"under the banner of economic globalization.\\"  Birzer saves that bad news for the last of his six major chapters, which cover Tolkien's life, Sub-creation, Created Order, Heroism, Nature of Evil, then Middle-earth and Modernity.  A conclusion promises \\"The Nature of Grace Proclaimed.\\"<br />On days when the world seems enthralled with a myth in which we are the noose, and those who do not heed roadblocks in their own neighborhoods are likely to perish in the operations which are attempting to destroy the remnants of last year's government, in those cities where the formerly powerful might still be hiding, it is theologically challenging to see how, in the world of \\"faerie,\\" the inhabitants could picture such events as evil, particularly in the eyes of those who keep getting into the news by chanting that America is the devil.  J. R. R. Tolkien was not the most innocent author to live in the 20th century.  Though he was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, in 1892, his father and mother were both dead by the end of 1904, and the priest who was Tolkien's guardian would not let him marry until he was 21, so he got married on March 22, 1916, at the age of 24, after he had joined \\"one of the most decorated English regiments of World War I.  A year later, he saw battle at the Somme, one of the bloodiest of the war.\\"  (Birzer, p. 2).  To become a famous author, Tolkien first becamean Oxford don, shared writings with a group of friends they called Inklings, and mumbled like a man with a pipe.

This biography has many short chapters, and displays a considerable balance.  The structure of the book reflects the nature of Hayek's thoughts.  \\"Hayek put forward the difficult idea of spontaneous order.  In a spontaneous order, individuals may exchange and interact with one another as they desire.  There is no central management of individual decision making.\\"  (p. 3).  The fame of Friedrich Hayek is associated mainly with the political views needed to maintain a thriving economy as much as with the idea that no one person knows everything that is going on in an economy which functions as Adam Smith pictured, with each person acting in his own interest in order to produce the mix of goods and services that best provides the needs of all.  Adam Smith is listed in the index, but not quite as much as Milton Friedman, who is occasionally mentioned as being more popular than Hayek, as well as more correct in the analysis of monetary policy in the United States at the start of the great depression.<br />Hayek finished a law degree and a second degree in political science from the University of Vienna before he lived in the United States from March 1923 to May 1924.  (p. 31).  One of his first economic articles in 1924 was \\"on American monetary policy suggesting that an expansionist credit policy leads to an overdevelopment of capital goods industries and ultimately to a crisis. . . . So I put in that article a long footnote sketching an outline of what ultimately became my explanation of industrial fluctuations. . . . A rate of interest which is inappropriately low offers to the individual sectors of the economy an advantage which is greater the more remote is their product from the consumption stage.\\"  (p. 41).  The Federal Reserve Bank had been designed to keep the economy moving by offering great deals to capitalists, but when Hayek noted the tendency to produce instability, he became the head \\"of the evolution of Austrian business cycle theory.\\"  (p. 41).  When the depression became the lowest point reached by the American economy in the 20th century, Hayek continued to think that low interest rates in the 1920s had produced the instability which produced it, while Milton Friedman produced a monetary explanation which is more widely accepted.<br />Public opinion is often a matter of simplifications which avoid the complexity that real problems present.  Chapter 8, on Keynes, quotes Keynes attacking Marxism as if Marxism were nothing but a public opinion.  \\"How can I adopt a creed which, preferring the mud to the fish, exalts the boorish proletariat above the bourgeois and intelligentsia who, with whatever faults, are the quality of life and surely carry the seeds of all human advancement?\\"  (p. 68).  German was a problem for Keynes, who wrote \\"in German I can only understand what I know already!\\"  (p. 70).  Hayek tried to review Keynes' TREATISE ON MONEY  for an English journal, \\"Economica,\\" when he was about to start teaching at the London School of Economics.  Keynes seemed to think that his criticism could be characterized as \\"The wild duck has dived down to the bottom--as deep as she can get--and bitten fast hold of the weed and tangle and all the rubbish that is down there, and it would need an extraordinarily clever dog to dive after and fish her up again.\\"  (pp. 357-358).  Hayek was allowed to publish a reply in the \\"Economic Journal\\" edited by Keynes \\"to an article by Piero Sraffa attacking him, and concluded his reply, `I venture to believe that Mr. Keynes would fully agree with me in ... that he [Sraffa] has understood Mr. Keynes' theory even less than he has my own.'  Keynes then footnoted, `I should like to say that, to the best of my comprehension, Mr. Sraffa has understood my theory accurately.' \\"  (p. 72).  The finishing touches on this argument are complex.  Keynes wrote that his footnote was appended to Hayek's reply \\"with Prof. Hayek's permission,\\" (p. 72), a sure sign that Keynes was amused at agreeing farmore with Sraffa, however Hayek might feel about it, and that he had done everything he could to force Hayek to see it his way.<br />Hayek was admired most for his popular book, THE ROAD TO SERFDOM, which considered central planning in control of an economy as a major step on the way to totalitarianism.  He expected his book, THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY, to appeal to the same readers, but when it was published on February 9, 1960, people had other concerns.  In \\"The New York Times Book Review,\\" Sydney Hook presented the mainstream economic opposition to Hayek's major concerns.  \\"He is an intellectual tonic.  But in our present time of troubles, his economic philosophy points the road to disaster.\\"  (p. 203).<br />Considering disasters in the area of economics, it is difficult to counter the idea that any government program offers the kind of deviation from stability that anyone would expect from a drunken bat.  One idea that was almost popular at the end of the 20th century was a lockbox, where workers' money could be kept until it was time for them to retire.  Hayek followed John Locke in thinking that civil government can maintain an impartial liberty through \\"certain basic rules on everybody.\\"  (p. 224).  LAW, LEGISLATION AND LIBERTY was supposed to provide some guidelines, but there was no lockbox in the title, or in the title of any of Hayek's books.  Now tax law has changed, as a basic incentive for a rise in the price of common stock, without safeguards to see that income is taxed even once.  Speculation seems to be the common assumption upon which everyone is now to be satisfied.  Actually, I suppose the government might never stop flying around like a drunken bat.  For all the complexity in this book, it is much less like a drunken bat than the opinions I find in any newspaper.more with Sraffa, however Hayek might feel about it, and that he had done everything he could to force Hayek to see it his way.<br />Hayek was admired most for his popular book, THE ROAD TO SERFDOM, which considered central planning in control of an economy as a major step on the way to totalitarianism.

US	44184384	R11DBVZ33XYGAY	0395971306	328102720	Between Friends: Perspectives on John Kenneth Galbraith	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Sharing a point of view	This is a birthday tribute book, in which a famous author, Harvard professor, economist, former Ambassador to India, and incredible wit is praised in print by people who find themselves honored by the opportunity to detail their links with John Kenneth Galbraith.  Many names are scattered throughout the book, which has no index for finding them again.  All my life I have wanted to be smart enough to be as witty as JKG, and in the present economic situation, it is a great comfort to find evidence that so many people share that aspiration.  Freud is mentioned as a possible source of \\"a similar remark about individual people in psychoanalysis\\" needed for a comparison on page 126 with a comment of Karl Marx in CONTRIBUTION TO THE CRITIQUE OF POLITICAL ECONOMY, originally published in 1859, \\"Mankind inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve.\\"  Conversations between these people can be daunting when it seems to lack any point whatever, and JKG has the kind of courage that it takes not to worry when an interest in political economy puts someone in a spot which requires responses at a level which most people have trouble maintaining at their best, responding to cues about basic conditions that establish who they are in ways that the inquisitive JKG could notice, when it was missing in those who had formerly been powerful, as when he met ex-Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas Home and told Roy Jenkins, \\"Who was that man?  I thought he was Alec Home.\\"  (p. 50).<br />Power is a major consideration in this book, as a factor that was not adequately considered in the mainstream economic theory of motives which were thought classically to drive supply and demand.  JKG noticed that the affluent society's maximization of production produced an increased need for public goods like trash collection and police to protect people from being swindled.  The friendly tributes at the beginning of the book frequently note how tall and witty JKG was, and pages 161-175 at the end provide examples from books that JKG wrote of his thoughts on Farming, The Scotch, Rules of Academic Life, Economics and Economists, Writing, Politics, Politicians, Family, Places, and The Wisdom of Age.  My favorite choice of words, \\"or a drunken bat,\\" (p. 171) occurs in the section on Politics, and seems less hyperbolically suggestive of the fears that the Scotch possessed and the way everyone felt in 1968 than the kind of comparison which JKG used to describe a government crisis, in addition to \\"or a drunken bat.\\"<br />I have not been doing Harvard many favors in recent thoughts which associate it most frequently with the Unabomber, Daniel Ellsberg, or Henry the K., who was repudiated when he might have wished to retain the kind of association with Harvard that JKG maintained for 50 years.  Galbraith was a key adviser to JFK, and his book LETTERS TO KENNEDY still makes interesting reading, but JKG did not stay on for the debacle produced by President Johnson, and many in this book considered JKG a leader of the effort to oppose the Vietnam war.  Political party was not an overriding consideration for JKG, certainly not in 1981 when he wrote the description of Johnson which is included in this book, that might be applied to Woodrow Wilson or any number of American presidents.<br />\\"Johnson sought to compensate for his uncertainty in foreign policy with an outward display of firmness, strength, decisiveness.  This made him open to the advice of those who urged the seemingly strong as distinct from the restrained and considered course.  Perhaps also his instinct was for an assertively masculine pose, as others have suggested.  Combined, these qualities put him at the mercy of those who took pride not in their knowledge but in their will to act.  Thus the disaster in Southeast Asia.\\"  (p. 173).<br />Seriously, though, there is a section on Economics in this book and an attempt throughout to present phrases which JKG ought to get credit for adding to the vocabularyof political economy.  On the birthday question, if you hurry, you should be able to obtain and read this book prior to October 15, 2003, when John Kenneth Galbraith will be 95 and coincidentally, Friedrich Nietzsche will be 159, though Nietzsche has been dead more than a hundred years.

US	44184384	RY5XN6BDLFWV2	0226320626	647773742	Hayek on Hayek: An Autobiographical Dialogue (Supplement to the Collected Works of F.A. Hayek)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Master of free trade arguments	Concern for the self in this book zeroes in on the intellectual basis for a tremendous reputation in free world economics.  It is by and about Friedrich August von Hayek, who died on March 23, 1992.  Most of the 170 pages are devoted to the years leading up to THE ROAD TO SERFDOM, which Hayek wrote during World War II and published in 1944.  The &quot;autobiographical notes that Hayek wrote over a period of years beginning in 1945,&quot; (p. ix) which are used throughout the book, tend to look back into his past.  Part Three, beginning on page 99, explains that the war provided a setting for thinking and writing &quot;studies on the abuse and decline of reason to which I had devoted the first two years of the war.&quot;  (p. 99).  Part Three ends with a transcript (pp. 110-123) of a Radio Discussion, April 22, 1945, with University of Chicago assistant professor of economics Maynard C. Krueger, national chairman of the Socialist party, who ran as vice-presidential candidate on the national Socialist ticket in 1940, and Professor Emeritus Charles E. Merriam, who served three terms as alderman on the Chicago &quot;City Council, and in 1911 was narrowly defeated for mayor of Chicago.&quot;  (p. 109).<br />The discussion begins with a few pages on planning.  When directly questioned about TVA, Hayek responded, &quot;There is a great deal of the TVA to which no economist in repute, and certainly not the laissez-faire people, will object. . . . If the hydroelectric power really could not have been provided by private enterprise, I have no objection.&quot;  (p. 113).  If you really want economic growth, Hayek has a point, &quot;where you can create a competitive situation, you ought to rely upon competition.&quot;  (p. 113).  This might be the same point:  &quot;I am a convinced free-trader, and free trade is part of the same philosophy.&quot;  (p. 115).<br />The former alderman, Merriam, notes how the competition of ideas may result in the opposite of Hayek's ideal.  &quot;It was not the fact of communism but the fear of communism that was the most powerful factor in the development of Naziism.&quot;  (p. 117).  The argument gets back to planning, as Hayek says, &quot;That method of central planning which is proposed as an alternative method of organizing production to take the place of competition means that a government, or some central authority, must take complete control of the resources.&quot;  (p. 119).  &quot;Most of the war controls are central planning, but it is only temporary. ... During the war, we all have to go to some extent totalitarian.&quot;  (p. 119).<br />If people have truly lost control of the government whenever it puts itself in a war unnecessarily, the socialist Krueger might be addressing everybody when he asserts, &quot;You seem to place no faith whatsoever in the political process as a means of keeping government responsible to the people.  Is that really your position?  Do you have no faith in the political process as a means of establishing responsibility?&quot;  Hayek is as contrary as possible on this point.  &quot;I am quite convinced that it cannot be effectively controlled by the democratic process.  It requires a degree of agreement among people which we can never expect in a free society.&quot;  (p. 121).  One sure quality of death, particularly during wartime, is that we will never hear a live broadcast of those three thinkers on the radio again.  Since television has cut attention spans, Merriam might be truer than he knew then about Hayek's chapter of THE ROAD TO SERFDOM &quot;on `Why the Worst Get on Top,' you seem to express grave doubts about the ability of a democratic society to accomplish much.  You say, for example, that the more intelligent people are, the less likely they are to agree.&quot;  (p. 122).  Who would be willing to apply Hayek's concluding sentence to a current catastrophe -- lacking any economic sense, but costing billions -- American activities in Iraq?  &quot;I had realized that some kind of state action is extremely dangerous.  Therefore, my whole effort was to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate action.  I have attempted to do that by saying that, so far as the government plans for competition or steps in where competition cannot possibly do the job, there is no objection; but I believe that all the other forms of government activity are highly dangerous.&quot;  (p. 123).<br />Part Four starts out with some &quot;wholly abstract problems.&quot;  (p. 125).  He spent years writing THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY, &quot;so that I was able to take the finished manuscript to my American publishers on my sixtieth birthday, May 8, 1959.&quot;  (p. 130).  Most of us were a lot younger back then, and to escape retirement at the age of 65, Hayek moved back to Germany.  While the conversations quoted in this book are often after that date, they usually refer to what occurred in the years when he was most active in what was going on in the world.  As a thinker, it is not surprising that he made more money than Karl Marx.  The Index of Persons and Places on pages 161-170 is one of the best I have seen for explaining who each person mentioned in the book was, with more about Lord John Acton than about Achilles, and not much on Karl Marx (1818-1883).  A question that he was asked in an interview printed in Reason magazine (July 1992), supposed that Joseph Schumpeter had been more right than Marx on how governments could be more responsible for &quot;the collapse of capitalism due, not to its weakness (as Marx had predicted), but due to its strengths.&quot;  (p. 154).  Hayek could enjoy this paradox of Schumpeter, &quot;that capitalism was certainly much better but it will not be allowed to last, while socialism is very bad but it is bound to come.&quot;  (p. 154).  Democracy allows the freedom for people to complain in ways that can inspire the government to make things worse, if I am catching the drift.lized that some kind of state action is extremely dangerous.

US	44184384	R1B95V83MPX5CM	0691011710	710007138	The Making of the Cold War Enemy: Culture and Politics in the Military-Intellectual Complex	Books	4	1	13	N	N	How the West won	More than an overview of the best university and think tank efforts to help American policy makers turn the Cold War into a propaganda battle that the West could win, THE MAKING OF THE COLD WAR ENEMY by Ron Robin (Princeton University Press, 2001) almost captures the perversity of the times in which World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam were not quite what everybody was expecting to happen next, but close enough to fit into the conceptual framework that explains how narcissism was the greatest enemy against which governments and the social planners on every side were sure to end up offending someone.  Typical of the thinkers included, Thomas Schelling is given credit for maintaining a single idea.  \\"Whether analyzing the strategies of America's global adversaries, domestic economic developments, or social trends at home and abroad, Schelling identified monopoly--economic, political, or ideological--as the source of all evil.\\"  (p. 39).<br />Don Quixote does not appear in the index of this book.  Karl Marx isn't there, either, or any philosopher who might be associated with the concept, \\"end of ideology,\\" which is an entry in the index and is discussed at several places in the book.  After World War II, the shift in psychological warfare was not much, because \\"the task of the efficient psychological warrior was to devise a mechanism for circumventing the repressive devices of modern civilization in general and military life in particular in order to tap into the individual's natural state of narcissism.  The exploitation of socially subversive primal drives was the main, if not the only, task of efficient psychological warfare.\\"  (p. 96).  I was surprised that a journal article by Edward Shils, \\"The End of Ideology?\\" in 1955 was \\"credited with coining the phrase `end of ideology,' \\" (p. 130) in those contexts where \\"political rhetoric was of little significance.\\"  (p. 130).<br />There is a single entry in the index for Henry Kissinger, due merely to a comment he made for a New York Times article on reactions to the book, REPORT FROM IRON MOUNTAIN.  \\"A chagrined Herman Kahn dismissed the report as `very bad satire,' while Henry Kissinger diagnosed the author as `an idiot.' \\" (p. 229).  The seven pages of the index do not fully reflect the number of times that some names appear in the book.  I'm not actually sure if the name, Don Quixote, appears in the book, but I know that other names in the book have prompted me to check the index, only to wonder if the author, a Professor of History at Haifa University in Israel, has a habit of referring offhandedly to characters of books, television shows, or movies, as President Ronald Reagan frequently did, which are just as fictitious as Don Quixote.<br />One name in the index, Carl Pletsch, is of an author whom I have slighted far more than he ever slighted me, and in 1981 he wrote a journal article, \\"The Three Worlds, or the Division of Social Scientific Labor, circa 1950-1975\\" which is covered by this book.  \\"As historian Carl Pletsch has observed, modernization theorists approached the competing socialist bloc as a proto-modern development, encumbered temporarily by an ideology preventing its `efficient and natural' development.  By contrast, the free world appeared to be at a higher evolutionary stage, `guided by invisible hands' and supposedly developing `without ideological prescription or management.'

The tenth chapter was the goal of this quixotic quest, \\"Paradigm Lost:  The Project Camelot Affair,\\" on pages 206-225 would bring about \\"Extensive disenchantment with modernization as dominant theory and the demise of Project Camelot as exemplary praxis.\\"  (p. 224).

US	44184384	R2E7K7PEK2YY02	0471184772	725481065	Who's Afraid of Adam Smith?: How the Market Got Its Soul	Books	3	1	9	N	N	Unplugging a new Prometheus	Economics has been a large part of everyone's political expectations lately.  In WHO'S AFRAID OF ADAM SMITH? / HOW THE MARKET GOT ITS SOUL by Peter J. Dougherty, there is a section called \\"Prometheus Unplugged\\" at the end of Chapter 1, ..., in which we are expected \\"to watch economists expand impressively on the technical side of Adam Smith's legacy.  Continuing breakthroughs in the analytical apparatus of fields such as finance, strategy, growth, organizations, trade, and money promise to charge the wealth of nations in untold ways, to fuel the fire of economic growth . . .\\"  (p. 19).  That is not what is happening.  I just read HAYEK ON HAYEK, (1994) on how THE ROAD TO SERFDOM (1944) by F. A. Hayek tried to demonstrate that modern methods will not dominate any market by political means because of the complexity of systems in which no one knows what is coming next.  People who plan big budget surpluses always have them snatched away before the national debt is reduced to a pittance.  Cutting taxes is a political stunt, in this context, in which even WHO'S AFRAID OF ADAM SMITH? is trying to tell us, \\"As economist Paul Romer has said of the connection between innovation and growth, `No amount of savings and investment, no policy of macroeconomic finetuning, no set of tax and spending incentives can generate sustained economic growth unless it is accompanied by countless large and small discoveries that are required to create more value . . .' . . . history instructs us that the real leaps forward--those that yield true progress--come from those new intellectual breakthroughs, not political logrolling.\\"  (pp. 39-40).  Neither party is going to learn how to save a geopolitical economy by reading this book, as long as the recent growth in the amount of money available for investment has driven the rate of interest, the return for money market funds, to almost zero.<br />What is going on?  Individual addictions have become so therapeutic for people in American society that it doesn't take long for most people to get what they want.  Smokers are currently in the process of being saved from their road to serfdom, and they might get stomped out for openly enjoying something that is almost condemned in this book.  \\"Note the number of rich and middle-class kids who still head to the psychic hinterlands or into drugs or sex or music in search of Meaning or something that closely resembles it.\\"  (p. 34).  I have tried to argue with those people, and have discovered that most of them would rather not argue about economics at the level currently utilized in U.S. politics, but they applaud Ralph Nader for saying, *The future of the economy of this country is industrial hemp.*  Check with Ralph on that quote.  It always seems to be funnier, somehow, when he says it.<br />Allow me to call the author of this brisk little book P.J.  This has shades on the cover, informally, I'm sure, but the Preface ends with thanks \\"To Grady Klein, cunning designer, my thanks for a jacket that so beautifully captures the spirit of this work.\\"  (p. xiv).  Chapter 1 blends economics with P.J.'s knowledge of publishing books, a profession which has allowed P.J. to associate with Nobel prize winners.  Chapter 2 is short, on the success of Paul A. Samuelson's textbook on economics, introducing the ideas of Keynes on smoothing out business cycles to a generation of college students since 1948.  Selling more than 750,000 copies established a common outlook among professional people concerned with wealth, and P.J. would like to see a consensus on growth preserved.  But at the beginning of Chapter 3, The Warning, is Robert Heilbroner, \\"If socialism failed, it was for political, more than economic, reasons; and if capitalism is to succeed it will be because it finds the political will and means to tame its economic forces.\\"  (p. 30).  American troops wiping out a convoy of smugglers at the border of Iraq and Syria is not something that John Maynard Keynes was contemplating when he wrote the other quote, about capitalism trying to be \\"as efficient as possible without offending our notion of a satisfactory way of life.\\"  (p. 30).  The old people who have grown used to being a growing part of the consumers of American society, and whose numbers are about to boom like the children of those who believed in the economic growth that became standard in 1948, while P.J. reports that modern economics, \\"in the wake of the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001--\\" (p. 186) is shifting to \\"a new and bewildering set of concepts that include slinky terms like . . . information cascades, adaptive behavior, market friction, diffusion rates, and other such exotica.\\"  (p. 187).<br />I don't actually think that growth is the ticket that is taking the global economic community anywhere that it wants to go, though it is easy to see why political speeches still try to push audiences in that direction.  Effective economic organizations, a safety net, and even P.J.'s concern for the moral side of Adam Smith's legacy need to be preserved longer than the smokers.ng when he wrote the other quote, about capitalism trying to be \\"as efficient as possible without offending our notion of a satisfactory way of life.\\"  (p. 30).

US	44184384	R375J627DU3WPB	0195128478	797844651	Lost Crusader: The Secret Wars of CIA Director William Colby	Books	4	8	23	N	N	History now, not current events	Anyone who thinks of Saint Paul, Minnesota as an Irish Catholic stronghold ought to be able to imagine Margaret Egan Colby giving birth to William Egan Colby here on January 4, 1920, (p. 20), only one day after my own mother was born someplace else.  LOST CRUSADER/ THE SECRET WARS OF CIA DIRECTOR WILLIAM COLBY by John Prados (Oxford University Press, 2003) is full of such close associations.  Prados does not approve of everything that was done, however much Colby might.  For example, after Hugh Tovar's service in Jakarta, \\"What Colby did can only be interpreted to show that he thought highly of the Indonesian affair:  Colby dispatched the CIA's man on the scene of the bloodbath to Laos to run the agency's secret war there, probably the Far East Division's most sensitive covert operation.\\"  (p. 157).  A number of issues are pursued throughout the book, over many chapters and in many settings.  References to crusaders (what would Osama say?) might be considered a geopolitical red flag in 2003.  Is CIA policy in the Middle East like certain popes who considered the rulers of the Holy Land (long ago) as of the wrong religion to control Jerusalem?  This is still a dicey question today.<br />As an undergraduate at Princeton, starting in the fall of 1936, \\"Religious Catholic that he was, Bill had a problem with the Princeton rule that first- and second-year students had to attend at least half of Sunday chapel services, as the school was strongly Presbyterian.  Colby fulfilled this requirement by becoming an altar boy at the Catholic Chapel.\\"  (p. 25).  I'm not sure why this would be a problem, unless Presbyterians automatically take attendance, but the priest doesn't look to see who is at mass, wouldn't remember anyway, and only keeps a schedule of who is serving as altar boy.  Later, while Colby was working for the CIA in Rome under Ambassador Clare Booth Luce, it is reported that Pope Pius XII had excommunicated all Italian communists in 1949, (p. 55) a sure sign that he didn't want to see them around anymore.<br />The early part of LOST CRUSADER fills in a lot of information on his OSS activities in France and Norway, where Colby wanted to capture the town of Lierne in Operation \\"Rype,\\" but was delayed until after the German capitulation in May, 1945, when the Germans \\"gave up on May 11 without difficulty.  Major William E. Colby corralled 10,000 German soldiers.\\"  (p. 33).  He was not so lucky on his first day in Saigon, where he was assigned as CIA deputy chief of station in February, 1959.  Cambodian troops had arrested Cambodian General Dap Chhuon just days after he had been visited by Ed Lansdale and senior U.S. Pacific Theater Commanders who \\"were traveling on a survey of United States military assistance programs and stopped in Cambodia.\\"  (p. 67).  Among the items captured by the Cambodian troops on February 21, 1959 was \\"a CIA radio and its agency operator, Victor M. Matsui.\\"  (p. 68).  Colby had to explain to the Cambodians what Matsui had been doing there.  Richard M. Bissell had ordered some communication with the plotters because \\"Bissell had wanted to know about Cambodian events as the plot unfolded, perhaps to see how these things worked\\" (p. 68) purely as a means of gathering intelligence, but Norodom Sihanouk (with Wilfred Burchett) published a book in 1974, MY WAR WITH THE CIA, that bitterly complained, \\"The CIA was in the forefront (except, when it suited their purposes, to remain concealed) of every plot directed against my life and my country's integrity.\\"  (p. 68, see Chapter 6, n. 1, p. 350).<br />In Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the links that tied CIA activities in those countries to Bill Colby were so similar in nature that one of the few jokes in the book tying them all together came from Army Colonel Charles Wilson, at Pleiku in 1964, who `described the Ho Chi Minh Trail as the \\"Averell Harriman Memorial Highway,\\" which must have tickled Colby, who had to deal with Harriman during the Laotian negotiations at Geneva.'  (p. 133).  Considering that Woodrow Wilson and Bill Colby both attended Princeton, an amazing coincidence is how often each of them disagreed with a Henry Cabot Lodge.  The Lodge who became an ambassador to South Vietnam in 1962 was the Junior of the two, but he still had a mind of his own.<br />Buddhists were expected to be the kind of people who would cause little trouble for either side, but just having demonstrations created a weird scene in which `Madame Nhu spoke sarcastically about bonze \\"barbeques,\\" while Nhu himself demanded a hard line, resisting concessions.'  (p. 110).  In Vietnam, the French \\"had created an indigenous elite using Catholicism as a means of ascription.\\"  (p. 111).  70 percent of Vietnamese generals were raised as Catholics and \\"an additional 16 percent of Vietnamese generals converted to Catholicism after Diem's rise to power.  Nguyen Van Thieu stood among them.  Most telling of all, only four Vietnamese generals would admit to being Buddhists, out of a cohort of almost a hundred.\\"  (p. 110).  By early 1965 the CIA was seeking \\"extension of covert support to key Buddhist leaders.\\"  (p. 145).  Nguyen Khanh, \\"himself a Buddhist\\" (p. 142), who had been a Viet Minh in the August Revolution of 1945, (p. 177) became the South Vietnamese leader in 1964, while Henry Cabot Lodge was Ambassador, but Maxwell Taylor took over as Ambassador in the summer of 1964.  (p. 142).  On August 25, 1964, a CIA cable to Colby complained that Khanh \\"has in effect put his government entirely in the hands of Tri Quang.\\"  (p. 142).  In January, 1965, Colby went to Vietnam with McGeorge Bundy on a trip that included an incident in Pleiku \\"that killed many Americans in their barracks.\\"  (p. 145).  \\"Another feature of Mac's Vietnam trip would be a meeting with the Buddhist Tri Quang.

Having a great president appeals to the kind of people that truly believe it makes so many states worthy of uniting into a single country, though Lincoln, who preserved the Union, might have been a deeper thinker than anyone in the pellucidly placid times in which we ought to live would realize.  Hundreds of years later, we should be grateful that we don't have the problems they faced, particularly the wars fought on American soil in their times.  Woodrow Wilson is the first (or the first American president after Polk, McKinley, and Teddy Roosevelt) to think that the power of the United States might be so great that fighting a war in other parts of the world could settle the hash of the rest of the world so well that all nations would be forced to see things our way.  I'm afraid the book, WOODROW WILSON by Louis Auchincloss, makes it easier to count the ways in which Wilson ended up being wrong, even when he counted up to 14 points, than any history could show how compromising could have helped, on a few important occasions.<br />Louis Auchincloss seems to be well informed about the leading cultural figures of Wilson's time, and the book contains a number of quotations from people who were paying attention, as well as clear descriptions of the positions of Colonel House, Henry Cabot Lodge, Walter Lippmann, and Edith Bolling Galt or Wilson.  There are ten chapters and no index, so it is not easy to look up anything specific, such as who considered Roosevelt Dionysian in making emotional appeals to the people, while &quot;Wilson was the Apollonian, favoring the primacy of reason.&quot;  (p. 47).  Not everyone thought so.  &quot;Lindley Garrison, his first secretary of war, described him as a man of high ideals but no principles.&quot;  (pp. 47-48).  Wilson had prepared for the presidency by studying and writing, speaking well to crowds and offering policies that people might vote for.  He cut tariffs so much, he had to institute the income tax to provide sufficient government revenue, and tariffs went back up after he was no longer in office, but it worked:  people could import cheap sugar for a few years.<br />The medical information in the book is specific.  The president had a doctor, and also a wife who protected his health, after September, 1919, in her fear &quot;that any frank revelation of his health might have been fatal to her husband.&quot;  (pp. 2-3).  The anger that overwhelmed Wilson at the end of his life was related to the disability he had suffered, but it seems to relate as well to the intellectual sense of being stymied, after winning his big war, by the big questions, why?, for what?, that retained some religious significance for him, humbled though he had been in so many ways.  This book provides more than an outline of Wilson's character.  It is a tragedy that could spook the daylights out of anyone who thought some plan had been prepared for the situation that the world faces today, if not sooner.igh ideals but no principles.&quot;  (pp. 47-48).

Though I am not a published poet (in spite of describing myself as the most spaced out poet on the planet in a few reviews), I have been to Ann Arbor, Michigan and New Hampshire, and I was surprised with how similar some of our experiences have been.  I have been to a writing workshop, so it was possible for me to follow the process by which she has shared and refined poems before attempting to have them published.  I have also been to church and taken part in discussions in that context, and was not surprised that Jane Kenyon never found the courage to submit the final poem in the book, &quot;Woman, Why Are You Weeping?&quot; to that process.  People don't usually talk about `apathy and bafflement' while &quot;waiting/ for the bread and wine of Holy Communion&quot; after having been to India.  (pp. 205-09).<br />It would be awful for me to joke about the contents of this book, but I think I found a joke by Jane Kenyon in the article, &quot;Poetry and the Mail,&quot; originally published in &quot;The Concord Monitor,&quot; 16 August 1993.  &quot;All poets share one thing, however--a daily dependence on the mail.  `It is joy, and it is pain,' as the great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova once said, though not about the mail.&quot;  (p. 128).  The poem itself, &quot;Like a white stone in a deep well,&quot; (p. 16) is included in this book.  Memory is mentioned in the second line, and in the final line of the poem, and must be what Anna Akhmatova was thinking about, or about &quot;how the gods turned people/ into things, not killing their consciousness.&quot;  (p. 16)<br />Most of the poems by Kenyon in this book show up in the Interview with Bill Moyers (1993).  What I find most modern is the open discussion of depression, crept up on with a question about the melancholy of winter in the poem, &quot;February:  Thinking of Flowers.&quot;  (p. 151).  In a poem, &quot;Having it Out with Melancholy,&quot; the second part starts with a list of pills that takes up three lines, and I would bet that none of them ever appeared in any book that Freud read.  I like the poem &quot;Otherwise&quot; on pages 168-69.  The last one in the Moyers interview was &quot;Let Evening Come.&quot;  (pp. 170-71).  I suspect that most of the readers of this book will be serious poets.  It is difficult to imagine another group who would be eager to contemplate an article like &quot;The Physics of Long Sticks.&quot;  The last paragraph of that article is devoted to the question, &quot;Why can't people be more like dogs?&quot;  (p. 103).uot;Having it Out with Melancholy,&quot; the second part starts with a list of pills that takes up three lines, and I would bet that none of them ever appeared in any book that Freud read.

Less than a century later, Karl Marx was able to demonstrate, in his book, THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY, how vacuous the ideas of good and bad, as they are usually applied in political economy, turn out to be in practice.  Americans have largely accepted the notion of a consumer society totally dependent on copyright and trade laws to protect the value of the entertainment and related therapeutic products which it produces.  What might be most upsetting to readers of this book, that someone like myself could use it to reflect on the events of 9/11/2001 as a challenge to such modern assumptions, as if the policing powers which maintain the world financial situation of today have more to fear from an examination of how this book treats consumption than from the usual lessons based on the growth of wealth, might make this an unacceptable view of what this book actually says.<br />When this book was written, Adam Smith was able to combine economic ideas about the distribution and production (which he considered the highest good) of articles of commerce, in contrast to \\"the bad effects of the monopoly,\\" in a way that caused thinking people in Britain to believe that the world would be materially better off if the American colonies were free of rules which required those who produced all the tobacco from Maryland and Virginia to sell it in or through Great Britain.  Adam Smith was worried that capital maintained to store this product in London was depriving England of the opportunity to produce goods that would generate more wealth.  \\"At the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money.  The rule is, Weigh and pay.  At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the time only that goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough.\\"  The American revolution was greeted by economic free traders as an event likely to cause a great increase in the wealth of nations, and the normally victorious political element maintains a strong belief in this fiscal ideology.<br />The current situation might be closer to \\"the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse.\\"  Near the end of Book IV, \\"Of Systems of Political Economy,\\" Chapter VII, \\"Of Colonies,\\" there was a frightening example of how bad things might get to be.  \\"In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects of the colony trade.\\"  Plenty of things went wrong, causing a large portion of the population to feel that they were victims of circumstances, \\" . . . but above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\\"  Certainly, a great deal of money is in circulation today, and a tremendous amount is considered working capital, capable of producing many things that people might want, but the routine search for contraband includes cash in an amount exceeding $10,000, the amount which might be capable of buying a large amount of illegal substances.  Police are actually so unfamiliar with cash transactions that large amounts might be held as evidence, until the police have been convinced that they have no reason to suspect the person who had the money of being involved in any sort of laundering activity.  When Adam Smith was writing, his work was as shocking to those controlling the monopolies of his day as radical protests of today rile the police on the beat today, whose confiscation of vehicles, which are sometimes temporary, to see if they were used to transport illegal substances, is not considered in any way similar to hijacking airplanes in order to crash them into buildings which symbolize a violation of the right of the people to personal pleasure in a manner which averts the collapse of society as we know it.

The author and lectures were set in England, back in 1959, three years after an article called `The Two Cultures' had been published in New Statesman.  \\"There are about fifty thousand working scientists in the country and about eighty thousand professional engineers or applied scientists. During the war and in the years since, my colleagues and I have had to interview somewhere between thirty to forty thousand of these--that is, about 25 per cent.\\" (p. 12). The norm seemed to be: \\"The degree of incomprehension on both sides is the kind of joke which has gone sour.\\" (p. 12) This is the basis on which I base my claim that we are all living in a very comic society: the thing that we have in common is that we know different jokes. Any individual who can be characterized can be caricatured to the point of absurdity, and everyone else will understand the absurdity more than any particular aspect of being.<br />I consider myself a polymorphously perverse form of baby boomer humor: born after World War II, son of the clergy from farm families, educated in engineering and law, draftee with Nam service in the post-Tet quietus, often out of work, intellectually comfortable with books that no one is even trying to understand anymore. I know this book is a classic for sociological thought about modernity. The least surprising thing about this book is that the reference to \\"the kind of joke which has gone sour\\" followed a joke, at the beginning, about \\"one of the more convivial Oxford great dons . . . came over to Cambridge to dine. The date is perhaps the 1890's. . . . He addressed some cheerful Oxonian chit-chat at the one opposite to him, and got a grunt. He then tried the man on his own right hand and got another grunt. Then, rather to his surprise, one looked at the other and said, `Do you know what he's talking about?<br /> \\" `I haven't the least idea.'<br /> \\"At this, even Smith was getting out of his depth. But the President, acting as a social emollient, put him at his ease, by saying, `Oh, those are mathematicians! We never talk to them'.\\" (pp. 3-4).<br />These lectures have a tremendous amount of charm, but they remind me of how poorly society is capable of talking about important things, politics, or things that transcend politics, like a state of collapse that is sure to result from having extremely large short-term financial obligations with high interest rates (mostly demanded from countries which are falling behind) rapidly leading to a situation with absolutely no liquid assets.  One of the main reasons this situation can not be discussed is because no one knows who is going to be stuck dealing with it.  The suspense is making complacency difficult, if not impossible, as we all wait until everybody sees the whole thing happen in slow motion, which won't be until long after the big collapse. There is no index and the notes to this book are mostly informative. Note 18: \\"The number of engineers graduating per year in the United States is declining fairly sharply. I have not heard an adequate explanation for this.\\" (p. 57). I'll bet it was because the engineering students found out that most engineers are not highly paid, and the engineering professors didn't know anything that was worth any money to anyone who wanted to work outside of a few major specialties like chemical and electrical that required sophisticated skills. Compare what you know about economic growth with \\"The latest figures of graduates trained per year (scientists and engineers combined) are roughly U.K. 13,000; U.S.A. 65,000; U.S.S.R. 130,000.\\" (n. 19, p. 57). The lectures were a few years after the space race started when Sputnik went into orbit on October 4, 1957, and America decided to race for the moon.  Snow might have been happier if the world had opted for a longer term goal of economic abundance.  \\"This disparity between the rich and the poor has been noticed.  It has been noticed, most acutely and not unnaturally, by the poor.  Just because they have noticed it, it won't last for long.  Whatever else in the world we know survives to the year 2000, that won't.  Once the trick of getting rich is known, as it now is, the world can't survive half rich and half poor.\\"  (p. 44)onger term goal of economic abundance.  \\"This disparity between the rich and the poor has been noticed.

GOD'S LAUGHTER:  MAN AND HIS COSMOS by Gerhard Staguhn was originally published in German in 1990 as *Das Lachen Gottes.*  While I consider this book worth reading, the contents make the most sense to me if the book is read as a prelude to the question whether God might properly be considered as a person who suffers most from the status \\"until then he is always condemned to comedy\\" as described in section 273 of BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL by Friedrich Nietzsche.  GOD'S LAUGHTER is quite sophisticated about physics, which advanced in a truly spectacular fashion in the early twentieth century up to the point when further developments became secret, mostly due to Soviet and American military applications, or subject to more than the usual hypothetical doubt.  The idea of Stephen Hawking that finding at least one complete theory which accounts for the creation of the universe \\"would be the ultimate triumph of human reason--for then we would know the mind of God,\\" (p. 239) is subject to the conclusion, \\"In the end, all theory up to and including the quarks can be seen as a specific form of mythology.\\"  (p. 239).  The physics of subatomic particles and high energies is at least as difficult to grasp as modern theology, or even philosophy since Kant, so the real question might be who is more adept at dealing with the usual level of confusion about things.<br />The index of this book lists only the names of particular people, not their ideas, so it is difficult to use it to locate signs of decline like neutron bombs or the ultimate collapse of a star \\"into some kind of neutron slush.\\"  (p. 210).  Chapter 7, \\"Even Stars Must Die:  Red Giants, White Dwarfs, Black Holes,\\" describes what is expected to happen in \\"star ovens\\" as their density and temperature keep climbing.  The ultimate description of ourselves as previous stars is \\"With the exception of hydrogen, all the atoms--or rather atomic nuclei--of which we are made were once located inside stars that subsequently exploded as supernovae.\\"  (p. 209).<br />Nietzsche is in the index, and gets credit for the desire \\"to regain this world after God and the next world had been lost.\\"  (p. 32).  Written a hundred years after Nietzsche's books, this book is not afraid to admit that German ideas \\"betrayed his own life-affirming philosophy; thus providing a direct path to the nihilism of our century, which found its most terrible manifestation thus far in Nazi ideology.\\"  (p. 33).  Some of the results of physics were pretty terrible in the twentieth century, too.  Instead of taking such a gloomy view of reality, it is more cheerful to admit that Nietzsche had some amazing ideas that relate directly to the title of this book, and to the novel, LAUGHING WAR by Martyn Burke:<br />*Todlachen* said Sam Senior one day when they sat together in a booth too close to the jukebox.  It means laugh till it kills you.  It's a German word.  Oi, God too has a sense of irony.  (Burke, p. 34).<br />Nietzsche pictured that laughter most powerfully in Part Three of THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, at the end of the section called \\"Of Apostates.\\"  (Penguin Classics, translated by R. J. Hollingdale, p. 201.  THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, p. 294).<br />The conclusion of this book exhibits a modern level of sophistication.  \\"As with relapses into mythical and mystical thinking in past epochs, here, too, a deep religious exhaustion leads people to expect solid proof for the unprovable.  In a way, modern science adds fuel to this hope.\\"  (p. 238).  Though it is rarely mentioned, theology is still ticking, and Paul Tillich gets credit for saying, \\"This is the God Nietzsche said had to be killed because nobody can tolerate being made into a mere object of absolute knowledge and absolute control.\\"  (p. 246).  Readers of this book might not be aware of how limited any outlook based on ideas seems in a comparison with a monstrosity of teeming feelings which exceeds the scope of consciousness even more than this book, for GOD'S LAUGHTER is rather puny compared to the vast scope of Nietzsche's work.  The funny thing is that any decline in philosophy since the time of Nietzsche might have been intentional as far as everybody was concerned, so help me God.her puny compared to the vast scope of Nietzsche's work.

Erdman attempts to put the views of Blake into his social and economic setting.  The basic contrast between Eros and Thanatos, familiar to us from the late writings of Freud, \\"a brilliance now recognized by critics who speak of Blake as having anticipated `the whole of Freud's teaching' or Jung's charting of `psychic patterns,' \\" (p. 238), actually date back to the ancient Greek poet Empedocles, on whom Nietzsche lectured as a young college professor.  \\"The life of sexuality is the best, the noblest, the greatest opposition against the drive for divisions.  This is demonstrated most clearly in cooperation between the conflicting social classes for the sake of production.  That which belongs together is torn apart at some point and desires to be together once again with itself.  Love (philia) has the will to overcome the rule of strife:  [Empedocles] calls her Philotes, Affection, Cyprus, Aphrodite, and Harmonia (. . .).  Innermost to this drive is the search for equality:  with inequality for everyone, Aversion arises; with equality for all, want.  Nietzsche, THE PRE-PLATONIC PHILOSOPHERS (translated by Greg Whitlock, pp. 114-5).<br />This book makes the point very clearly with respect to America.  \\"To say that she wants to be loved, not raped, is to say, economically, that she wants to be cultivated by free men, not slaves or slave-drivers; for joy not for profit.\\"  (p. 210).  \\"For `counting gold' is not abundant living; and grasping colonies and shedding blood whether in the name of royal dignity or in the name of commerce is not living at all, but killing.\\"  (p. 209).  During the terror following the French Revolution, Blake was engraving from sketches showing \\"conditions of human servitude in the South American colony of Dutch Guiana during some early slave revolts\\" (p. 213) for a book by Captain J.G. Stedman on the years 1772 to 1777, but the book was not published until 1796.  \\"We know he was working on them during the production of his `Visions of the Daughters of Albion' because he turned in most of the plates in batches dated December 1, 1792, and December 2, 1793.\\"  Stedman \\"was in love with a beautiful fifteen-year-old slave, Joanna,\\" (p. 215) and married her, \\"But he was unable to purchase her freedom, . . .  The captain's own Joanna, to prove the equality of her `soul' to `that of an European,' insisted on enduring the condition of slavery until she could purchase freedom with her own labor.\\"  (p. 215).<br />Some details in this book are likely to make free people glad we have escaped so much, but most might fret that we are not actually being offered peace.  \\"In William Blake's Paradise the intellectual lions and lambs will not actually lie down together but will roar and bleat at each other in an energetic comradeship ranging over all topics which the Human Imagination can conceive.\\"  (p. 449).the book was not published until 1796.  \\"We know he was working on them during the production of his `Visions of the Daughters of Albion' because he turned in most of the plates in batches dated December 1, 1792, and December 2, 1793.\\"  Stedman \\"was in love with a beautiful fifteen-year-old slave, Joanna,\\" (p. 215) and married her, \\"But he was unable to purchase her freedom, . . .

US	44184384	R15J878KMCTEW2	0817005722	250376886	Protestant theology in the nineteenth century;: Its background & history	Books	4	3	13	N	N	Well informed about some things I know	As philosophy has developed into a field in which a prime consideration is whether it is possible to catch someone in the act of thinking, theology is expected to be something a bit different. In Chapter 23, on Richard Rothe, Karl Barth wrote: \\"His biographer Hausrath reports in amazement that one never seemed to meet him when he was not in secret conversation with an invisible power and reality; on one bright day during his lifetime he is said to have appeared to one of his pupils `in a transfigured form'.\\" For those who lack such attributes, as in the case of the most typical, Barth observed, \\"We may reflect upon the great practical problem he raised, which caused him to be so violently rejected, and think how he was in fact unable to find an effective counter to this rejection; we may observe him in the grief and loneliness which was brought upon him on the one hand by the truth he unwillingly represented, and on the other by the insufficiency and lack of fertility of his zeal for truth. Observing these things we involuntarily see not only him, bit in a certain aspect the typical theologian of the century, so that we are not then content, like Hausrath, to establish that Strauss was `essentially a pathological figure.' \\" I'm not giving a page number for anything in this review, knowing that a 1959 translation of eleven chapters of this book was published with the title FROM ROUSSEAU TO RITSCHL, the complete book was prepared from lectures \\"which Hitler prevented him from finishing\\" according to the Preface to the First Complete English Edition in the Judson Press edition, 1973, and I have not had an opportunity to compare either with whatever might be currently available.<br />What strikes me about the book, as a whole, is that it attempts to cover religious thought at a time which coincides with the concepts of Karl Jaspers in his unfinished history of THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS VOLUME IV, subtitled: The Disturbers. Barth died in 1968 and Jaspers in 1969, though Jaspers was born in 1883 and Barth in 1886, and both were concerned about German thought in the century that produced them. Jaspers sees a relationship between Kant and Lessing, though \\"Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON appeared a few weeks after Lessing's death.\\" Lessing might not have learned much from Kant, but Kant \\"learned aesthetics and religion from him. . . . Seen objectively, here were two Germans who overcame and went beyond the halfhearted and shallow Enlightenment of reason to the true enlightenment, which is the medium and presupposition of the philosophy of Existenz.\\" Kant and Lessing are both considered in Part I/Background of PROTESTANT THEOLOGY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY by Karl Barth.<br />A big difference between Barth and Jaspers is on David Friedrich Strauss, who gets credit, in Jaspers, for information on a huge volume by Reimarus, which \\"became known at a time when it had lost most of its interest. A quarter of the material was published in 1850-52 in Niedner's JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL THEOLOGY; the rest was reported on in a careful analysis by D. F. Strauss.\\" Barth is more interested in what Strauss might have been thinking, and quotes that, \\"he found it possible to write, as early as 7th April, 1837: `I am beginning to find the manner of pure science a dry one. I was not really meant to be a scholar; I am much too dependent upon mood, and far too self-occupied.' \\" (Chapter 19/Strauss). Barth even quotes Albert Schweitzer, [this is not in the book, D. FR. STRAUSS UND DIE THEOLOGIE SEINER ZEIT], who wrote, \\"Strauss must be loved in order to be understood.\\" Barth suggests that we sympathize. \\"It may well be that in David Friedrich Strauss, just because there is no tragic quality in him, a secret ailment of the whole of modern theology is focused and represented in a special way, so that it was not without justice that he was probably the best-known and most influential theologian of the nineteenth century, in non-theological and non-church circles.\\" It is in the field of music, in which the praise of Strauss for Mozart, the universal genius, where Barth found Strauss superior to those who most ferociously were his detractors. \\"In this poor Strauss really seems to have chosen the better part, as against Nietzsche, who, as is well known, was the helpless slave of the dreadful Wagner at the time of his great deriding of Strauss.\\"s in the field of music, in which the praise of Strauss for Mozart, the universal genius, where Barth found Strauss superior to those who most ferociously were his detractors. \\"In this poor Strauss really seems to have chosen the better part, as against Nietzsche, who, as is well known, was the helpless slave of the dreadful Wagner at the time of his great deriding of Strauss.\\"	2002-10-27

Dos Passos is sensitive to the progressive issues which were supposed to make politics meaningful to ordinary participants in the process, but the end of the book runs into prohibition, the moralistic attempt to legislate the end of all evils, which produced an economy of booming illegality and immorality on a scale that this book does not attempt to encompass.  Wilson's great wish, when the Treaty of Versailles was placed before the Senate, was, as Wilson put it, \\"The united power of free nations must put a stop to aggression and the world must be given peace . . . It has come about by no plan of our conceiving but by the hand of God who has led us into this way.\\"  (p. 483).  This is at the beginning of Chapter 24, which is called \\"The Supremest Tragedy.\\"<br />President Wilson, somewhere in this book, is asking the people who are talking to him for a continuation of his ideal: please find an American president who can think of the entire world to come after him.  He did not mean that American corporations need to acquire the right to see the whole world as booty in their quest for profits.  Personal details on how Wilson actually perceived the world include the Wilsons preparing for \\"the final longdrawn ceremonies of a dinner at the Elysee Palace:\\"  (p. 482):<br />(When the invitation came from Poincare Wilson flew off the handle.  He vowed he would not sit down at table with the swine.  It was as if all the resentment of the frustrations suffered in Paris were focussed into hatred of the stubby little President of the French Republic.  It was all House and Henry White could do to convince him that not to accept the invitation would cause an international incident.  Perhaps Mrs. Wilson had already clinched the matter by getting a special dress for the occasion designed for her by Worth.)  (p. 482).<br />One of the major characters in this book is Teddy Roosevelt, who became President in September 1901 after President William McKinley was shot in Buffalo, in the Temple of Music of the Pan-American Exposition.  The assassin declared that he had been inspired by \\"Emma Goldman who was inciting working people in Chicago to bring about the triumph of right and justice through anarchy. . . . The Chicago police arrested Emma Goldman but the judge turned her loose for lack of evidence.  Editorials demanded the deportation of foreign anarchists.\\"  (p. 4).  This book keeps bringing in T.R. as representative of the politics of these times until he was \\"too weak to talk.\\"  (p. 432).  \\"By Christmas T.R. was thought sufficiently recovered to go home.  Two weeks later he died, without a murmur, in his sleep in his own bed at Sagamore Hill.\\"  (p. 433).  There was a Congressional election campaign shortly before the armistice is 1918.  Late in July T.R.'s youngest son, Quentin, \\"had been shot down fighting a formation of German planes.  At first he was listed as missing.  Then the Germans reported his death and burial with full honors behind their lines near Cambrai.\\"  (p. 432).  T.R. made a campaign appearance \\"in Carnegie Hall, flashing his eyeglasses and clacking his teeth and waving his arms with his legendary zest\\"  (p. 432):<br />On October 26, before a packed and cheering audience, he hauled the President over the coals for his call for a Democratic Congress.  He denounced the arrogance of Wilson's conduct of the war.  With his customary combination of wild inflammatory statements and commonsense reasoning he tore the Fourteen points to pieces, crying out that they were shams and would not bring the peace with justice the American people wanted.  (T.R. hadn't been able to get Wilson's war away from him:  maybe he could carry off the peace.)  (p. 432).<br />Photograph number 25 from 1916 shows a campaign truck with a sign on the front that says:<br />VOTE FOR WILSON<br />PEACE WITH HONOR<br />PROSPERITY<br />PREPAREDNESS<br />On the side:  WHO KEEPS US OUT OF WAR?<br />The captions on the photos are brief, as skimpy as subtitles in a silent movie.  By 1916, \\"on the western front the British had lost half a million men and the French nearer two million, with the gain of only an occasional thousand yards of shellpocked mud on the Flanders front.\\"  (p. 156).  Wilson's Secretary of War, Lindley Garrison, and Assistant Secretary Breckenridge resigned because they favored universal military service while Wilson still thought \\"that the Administration could not move faster towards military preparation than the people moved.\\"  (p. 160).  Eight soldiers and eight civilians were killed in Columbus, New Mexico by several hundred men led by Villa on March 9, which was about the size of any problem an American Secretary of War ought to be able to handle, and \\"Wilson picked a man after his own heart.  Newton D. Baker was a progressive reformer and a Wilson man from long before Baltimore.  He was reputed to be an ardent pacifist.\\"  (p. 161).<br />There are some exciting descriptions of the war in France and the confusing situation in Russia at that time.  Details like \\"The growth of war exports, without compensating imports, tended to fill the railroad yards in the east with empty freightcars waiting for a westerly load.  On top of that the prolonged cold spell froze up locomotives, trapped barges on rivers and canals and increased the nationwide demand for coal and petroleum products.\\"  (p. 297).

At the time, \\"Wages represent only 37-38 percent of our gross national product--for the rest of the developed world that figure is 70 percent and over.\\"  (p. 142).  Parallels with present problems that continue to bother people who consider continuous progress an economic necessity of the first order might occur to any reader who is willing to think that the design of thermonuclear devices, for which the author, Andrei Sakharov, is famous, might be trivial compared to the kind of chain reactions which monetary policy produces.  Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev is a main character in this book, and Sakharov's attempt to tell him what needed to be done on June 1, 1989, reflects how rigidly the old system clung to \\"achievement of unlimited personal power.\\"  (p. 133)  This book suggested Sakharov's solution:  \\"In brief, economic reform is practicable only if there are changes in the character of ownership in agriculture and industry, if the Party's and state's stranglehold on power is ended and if the highway robbery practiced by the central committees is eliminated.\\"  (p. 130).<br />Global capitalism is not what it used to be.  Those who have taken control have pushed the envelope of subjugation and economic strangulation so far that it is difficult to refute the idea that the west supported the looting of the public assets in the former Soviet Union with the observation that those who were previously capable of highway robbery merely found an economic method for maintaining this power, as well as greatly increasing their wealth.<br />Soviet methods of maintaining control over the economy still seemed brutal in Sakharov's time.  \\"In those same days there was a shocking massacre in Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley.  The main victims were Meshki Turks, but Russians, Tatars, Jews, Armenians, and Ukrainians were also slaughtered.\\"  (p. 137)  \\"in any case, religious differences cannot be the motive--both the Uzbeks and the Meshki are Sunni Muslims.

Buckley, Jr. uses the style of the typical mystery detective to muse on the inner confusion which drove the ideology of secrecy in search of \\"The Golitsyn Epiphany: the United States Government continued unaware of the lengths to which Soviet policy was based on persistent, systematic, dogged disinformation and deception.\\" (p. 144). Chapter 56 covers Angleton's last 45 minutes on the job, from DCI Colby's \\"Effective at noon today you are relieved of all duties,\\" (p. 299) but Colby didn't actually say that his job was being terminated, so naturally James Jesus Angleton kept thinking along the same lines as throughout the book, obsessing on what is going to happen to things in his safe at \\"almost two in the morning.\\" (p. 302). The final chapter is clearly from Angleton's point of view. \\"I am doing an important exercise.\\" (p. 303). In the end, the nature of Angleton's personal obsession is made perfectly clear, but the vast stretched time in which the book is set, skipping from December, 1962 (Chapter 36, p. 205) to January, 1966 (Chapter 51, p. 271) to November, 1972 (Chapter 52, p. 276) to February, 1973 (Chapter 53, p. 281) to 1974 for the final chapters, manages to miss the length of time the agency lost to confusion in unnecessary disputes, as: \\"On the matter of Nosenko, for instance, I [Angleton] ruled that his credentials were suspect.\\" (pp. 291-2). If ever an agency did not want to believe what a Soviet agent was saying (the best example of a perfect failure since the great tragedy \\"Oedipus Rex\\"), it was whenever Nosenko was talking to the CIA, but the ability of intelligence to defeat itself is not what this book is about.is not what this book is about.	2002-10-23

I also have the book, KARL MARX by Isaiah Berlin, and noticed some of the same themes, though this book is mainly concerned with a half century prior to the writings of Karl Marx.  I try to see the humor in history, so when Isaiah Berlin says that Helvetius's principal work, published in 1758, \\"was found to be so atheistical, so heretical, that it was condemned both by Church and by State, and was burnt by the public hangman,\\" (p. 11) I'm not surprised that this might be \\"the first clear formulation of the principle of utilitarianism.\\"  (p. 13).<br />Rousseau is the philosopher that Berlin blames most frequently for stating opposition to those who are overly refined.  This includes \\"All those nineteenth century thinkers who are violently anti-intellectual, and in a sense anti-cultural, indeed . . . including Nietzsche himself, are the natural descendants of Rousseau.\\"  (p. 41).  The Germans were not particularly well off, politically or materially at the time, so some tried to advance themselves by studying Kant.  \\"Therefore, Kant says, the most sacred object in the universe, the only thing which is entirely good, is the good will, that is to say the free, moral, spiritual self within the body.\\"  (p. 57).  Fichte's biggest contribution to 20th century political thought in Germany has been on leadership as a solution for a crisis, and Berlin considers the hero:  \\"The favored image is that of Luther:  there he stands, he cannot move, because he serves his inner ideal.\\"  (p. 65)  But Fichte went in a philosophical direction.  \\"Fichte gradually adopts the idea that the individual himself is nothing, that man is nothing without society, that man is nothing without the group, that the human being hardly exists at all.\\"  (p. 67).  The first three pages of notes are mainly citations.  The notes on Fichte cover seven pages and include additional phrases from Fichte's work not mentioned in Berlin's lectures but noted on the manuscript.  This provides the opportunity to read bits like, \\"the natural institution of the State ends this independence provisionally and melts the separate parts into one whole, until finally morality recreates the whole species into one.\\"  (p. 166).<br />The notes on Hegel provide a citation for `slaughter-bench.'  Hegel gets credit for a new way of looking at the history of everything which is so inspired by greatness that \\"To see a vast human upheaval and then to condemn it because it is cruel or because it is unjust to the innocent is for Hegel profoundly foolish and contemptible.\\"  (p. 92).  Also, \\"Hegel's most original achievement was to invent the very idea of the history of thought.\\"  (p. 99).  From there, it figures that Saint-Simon would expect the French to produce rationally a society.  \\"For him, history is a story of living men trying to develop their faculties as richly and many-sidedly as possible.\\"  (p. 112).<br />On the other hand, I also have Isaiah Berlin's book, RUSSIAN THINKERS, and Joseph de Maistre, the last lecture topic for this book, was a source for Tolstoy.  \\"Maistre is fascinated by the spectacle of war.\\"  (p. 139).  \\"Tolstoy read Maistre because Maistre lived in Petersburg during the period in which he was interested, and he echoes his description of what a real battle is like, describing the experience of people present at the battle rather than giving the orderly, tidied-up account constructed later by eye-witnesses or historians.\\"  (p. 140).  After that, the phrase, \\"says Maistre in a mocking manner,\\" (p. 141) applied to the ideas in the preceding lectures, establishes that \\"No metaphysical magic eye will detect abstract entities called rights, not derived from either human or divine authority.\\"  (pp. 143-4).  I think the last lecture is far easier to understand than the others.n the others.	2002-10-21

The caption says, \\"My knack for magic tricks always worked with kids in Vietnam.\\" It is on the same page as a picture of \\"Randy Kehler giving the talk at Haverford College on August 28, 1969, that opened my eyes to the possibilities of resisting war.\\" The big question, who looks less like a fool? 14 kids who don't know what is going on, or the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) on the wall behind Randy, or Ellsberg having lunch with Henry Kissinger at San Clemente in August 1970, after Kissinger complemented Ellsberg on the Lowell Lecture series, \\"The Art of Coercion\\" which Ellsberg had given to Kissinger's seminar at Harvard in 1959, when Ellsberg got to explain Hitler: \\"Hitler had deliberately cultivated among his adversaries the impression of his own irrational unpredictability. He couldn't be counted on not to carry out a threat to do something crazy, mutually destructive.\\" (p. 344).<br />Secret activities generate an aura, THOU SHALT NOT ADMIT, which Daniel Ellsberg's book, SECRETS, is all about. Early in the book, on pages 7 to 20, the cable traffic of August 4, 1964, from Captain John J. Herrick in the Gulf of Tonkin, is explained as Ellsberg attempted to figure out what it meant from the Pentagon. The information provided is far less complete than in TONKIN GULF AND THE ESCALATION OF THE VIETNAM WAR by Edwin E. Moise, which analyzed the radar \\"skunks\\" picked up by the destroyers and the confusion caused by their inability to decide whether there had been three or five `(The fact that \\"N,\\" \\"O,\\" and \\"P\\" never got within twenty miles of the destroyers has been downplayed or completely ignored by most of the authors who have interpreted these skunks as North Vietnamese PT boats waiting in ambush for the destroyers.)' (Moise, p. 120). Mostly I think Ellsberg is wrong, as information coming from the government is typically wrong in ways that will protect intelligence gathering sources and methods, which really tried to maintain the illusion that everything the North Vietnamese had done had been unprovoked.  I don't believe \\"intercepted North Vietnamese cables supposedly confirming an August 4 attack actually referred to the attack on August 2.\\" (Ellsberg, p. 10). It seems far more likely to me that North Vietnamese cables confirming an attack on August 4 actually referred to a covert OPLAN 34A maritime operation 70 miles from the Maddox and the Turner Joy, about which McNamara testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1968, \\"that the President had announced publicly on 3 August that our patrol would continue and consist of two destroyers. It is difficult to believe, in the face of that announcement, and its obvious purpose of asserting our right to freedom of the seas, that even the North Vietnamese could connect the patrol of the Maddox and the Turner Joy with ... action taking place some 70 miles away.\\" (Moise, pp. 104-5). The secret circus stunt interpretation that I'm inclined to believe was that it was American intelligence which, interpreting cable intercepts of North Vietnamese reactions to the covert operation, convinced Captain Herrick 70 miles away that he was about to be attacked.<br />Ellsberg's book, SECRETS, has an index which lists a lot of people and incidents, but I found it a bit confusing on the major questions of our lifetimes. Checking out \\"Kennedy, John F.: assassination of, 194, 272,\\" the emotional outpourings on pages listed seem to apply more to Bobby than to JFK. \\"Being his own man in the Senate after losing his brother, and with his father disabled, must have had a lot to do with it.\\" (p. 194) He quotes Bobby on Nam, \\"We didn't want to lose in Vietnam or get out. We wanted to win if we could. But my brother was determined never to send ground combat units to Vietnam.\\" (pp. 194-5). A lot of people concerned about Nam in 1961, when the number of American military troops assigned there started to increase into the thousands, had trouble seeing a distinction between advisers and soldiers actually taking part in a war, and the distinction was not that American troops would only fire if they were fired upon. On the other assassinations in November, 1963, Ellsberg wrote:<br />Lansdale left Vietnam, and Diem and his brother were eventually assassinated in a U.S.-authorized coup, in which, ironically, Lansdale's former CIA team member Lucien Conein was the liaison between the coup plotters and the American ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, who strongly favored the coup.

This book is far too technical to have fugue-ing in the index. It doesn't even have confabulation. Sullivan's book, The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry (I gave my copy to my son last year, so I'm not seeing it now) might be a better source for functional definitions of the terms that I should be thinking about when I run my thinking into America's experience in Nam. I was hoping that, looking at descriptions of schizophrenia, I could find some technical description of aggravation, like: try grabbing a machine gun and shooting it straight up in the air ~ it works the same way.<br />Due to a 150 day drop when I ended my tour as a draftee in Nam, I only served 19 months in the U.S. Army. SCHIZOPHRENIA AS A HUMAN PROCESS by Harry Stack Sullivan contains a paper, \\"Psychiatric Training as a Prerequisite to Psychoanalytic Practice\\" originally reprinted from Amer. J. Psychiatry (1934-35), in which Stack attempted to convince the American Psychiatric Association to require psychiatric training in a mental hospital to contribute to \\"the professional competence of the psychoanalyst.\\" (p. 309). In order to learn anything, \\"I personally favor heartily the requirement that the young physician make many written statements as to his view of this and that. Suave, quick-minded people often conceal in their spoken comments misapprehensions that they entertain. Once their views are recorded, deficiencies in their formulations are readily pointed out. Intensive criticism . . . coupled with some clinical demonstrations of how things really are done and of what has significance in the relationship of a competent psychiatrist and his patient, would vastly abbreviate the staggering amount of time it takes the average intern to find a clue to the nature of psychiatric therapy. I have said often that it takes 18 months residence . . . Moreover, adequate supervision would remedy immediately one grave development that now involves many young physicians who enter the psychiatric field.

Most of these pictures record tiny episodes, but those thinkers with a long view might refuse to accept that there were ever two Nams in the 20th Century.  When France tried to pick a southern area called Cochin China for itself as a French colony in 1945, there should be little doubt that it was merely usurping part of Ho Chi Minh's independent Vietnam.  A picture shows Ho in Hanoi, 39 days after his declaration of Vietnamese independence on Sept. 2, 1945.  The picture of Le Minh Truong by himself, Kontum, 1972 (p. 114) is as unexciting as my own pictures taken in that area in 1970.  The surprising picture on page 49 was taken May 9, 1973, soon after the American withdrawal:  \\"Cuban leader Fidel Castro hoists a victory flag at the site of the strategic 1968 battle [Khe Sanh].\\"  There are so many troops in the picture that it doesn't show any bomb craters, and a mountain in the background (possibly as far away as Laos) shows that the area was not entirely leveled.  Khe Sanh had the highest priority for B-52 strikes when North Vietnamese troops threatened the U.S. troops there and this book says that \\"was part of the North's plan to divert U.S. and South Vietnamese forces from population areas prior to the Tet offensive.\\"  (p. 49).  This might provide a lesson for anyone planning a war against American forces, which are bound to rely on a strategy which depends heavily on bombing, and Americans are organized so they pay more attention to their top priority than to anything else.  A panorama made from six negatives of \\"supply trucks rolling through a ghost forest denuded by defoliants dropped by American planes\\" (p. 135) shows some of the damage from 40 million pounds of Agent Orange \\"which were sprayed over five million acres, creating environmental havoc.\\"  (p. 135).  Such tactics suggest that the war was against Nam as a whole, and not a strategy that would have been adopted by one half against the other.  The American Civil War was pretty bad, but Abe Lincoln never nuked the South.  General Sherman was hard on South Carolina, but not as bad as Americans who wanted to nuke Nam.  The defoliated mangrove forest, Ca Mau Peninsula, 1970 (p. 104-5) looks awful, \\"Americans denuded the landscape with chemicals to deny cover,\\" as if we were involved in a cat and mouse game, but couldn't decide how serious we wanted it to be.  A weird picture in which \\"An NVA soldier positions a Chinese-made mannequin\\" (p. 60) (a long time after Hamburger Hill) is the perfect: SO?  SHOOT ME picture.<br />I found a lot of irony in the information on page 56 about only 8 of 109 students (the guys who are smiling) being accepted into the army in Hanoi, Aug. 1971.  The standards were tough:  these \\"young men were chosen because they had good revolutionary credentials, which usually meant that they didn't come from landowning families.\\"  This sounds like a perfect way to pick people who would be willing to hold on to a government job, regardless of the circumstances.  The increase in the NVA, from 35,000 in 1950 to over 500,000 by the mid-1970s, didn't require a mandatory system until 1973, when the United States withdrew and the NVA was free to pursue military objectives without being bombed.  With the use of American support, South Vietnam's ARVN were capable of suffering \\"243,000 dead and a half a million seriously wounded.\\"  (p. 202).<br />Picture (p. 218) Russian MIGs \\"at a remote air base\\" on January 1, 1973 and the military parade (p. 220) on the outskirts of Hanoi in October, 1973, after the United States had stopped its bombing.  Hiding all these things is the result of a lot of effort.  On page 54, Hanoi, 1972 \\"Military trucks park in relative safety in front of the French embassy. . . . In November 1971, however, American bombs accidentally struck the embassy.\\"  It sounds like the embassy was still pretty safe, but the attack on the U.S. Embassy by a squad of Viet Cong sappers on January 31, 1968, mentioned on p. 151, definitely sounded intentional.nal.	2002-10-13
US	44184384	R8TWDBHZ29WM7	0877851441	935916280	THE HEAVENLY CITY: A SPIRITUAL GUIDEBOOK	Books	4	12	14	N	N	Interesting (in light of later developments)	I might never have bought this book on my own, but I was in a church study group.  This book was first published in Latin in 1758, before the American revolution.  Swedenborg had been trained in science and engineering, and worked in mining.  According to the Introduction, this book, &quot;the philosophy of the new religion,&quot; comes from heaven.  &quot;The only difference between things in heaven and things on earth is that everything in heaven is at a higher stage of development; everything there is spiritual, and spiritual things are far more developed than material things.&quot;  (p. 6).  This book is quite small, about a hundred pages.  Kant must have read far more of Swedenborg's dreams and visions before writing his book, DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER ILLUSTRATED BY DREAMS OF METAPHYSICS in 1766.  Kant had been hoping, before he read all he had of Swedenborg, that Swedenborg would be able to provide some explanation for the powers of telepathy which Swedenborg possessed, which were most amazing.  This book is confined to the topic of religion.<br />Things have changed in some denominations since 1758.  A note by the translator alleges that those churches where &quot;people are not allowed to read the Bible&quot; (p. 7) are different now.  Harmony, in this book, relates to a divine plan.  &quot;Goodness and truth come from the divine, which is the source of everything.  This means there cannot be anything in heaven or on earth that does not relate to these two things.&quot;  (p. 13).  Since human beings have motivation and understanding, &quot;The goodness in us is our motivation, and the truth in us is our understanding.&quot;  (p. 15).  An additional twofold aspect:  &quot;In good people, the inner part is in heaven with its light, and the outer part is in the world with its light. . . . In harmful people, the inner part is in the world with its light, and so is the outer part.&quot;  (p. 17).  For most people, &quot;We are `sense-oriented' when our inner part is so superficial that we do not believe anything unless we can see it with our own eyes and touch it with our own hands.  When we are like this, we are the lowest type of materialist, entangled in fallacies about everything that has to do with religious faith. . . . The body is just an extra outer part added on, in which the other two exist.&quot;  (p. 20).  Everything after that is about spirit.  &quot;Thinking and motivation are the spirit's inner part, and speech and action are its outer part.&quot;  (p. 20).<br />Chapter 10, on &quot;Freedom,&quot; starts to illustrate certain dangers.  &quot;Things we do under compulsion do not come from our own motivation, but from the motivation of whoever is forcing us to do them. . . . Freedom to do good things and freedom to do harmful things are as different and as distant from each other as heaven is from hell, though they seem outwardly similar.  Freedom to do good things comes from heaven, and is called heavenly freedom.  Freedom to do harmful things comes from hell, and is called hellish freedom.&quot;  (p. 54).  Religion becomes more important in Chapter 12:  &quot;When we are living in kindness and faith, we regret our faults every day.  We think about our bad traits, admit them, avoid acting on them, and ask the Lord for help.&quot;  (p. 63).  Not only do we suffer when we are under compulsion, according to Chapter 13, &quot;Every bad trait that has become second nature to us through long habit is passed on to our children. . . . Finally, so many bad traits have been passed down to us that all of our life is nothing but faults.&quot;  (p. 67).  But society has become so revolutionary in all its aspects, breaking chains of compulsion so often, all we are left with is Chapter 14, &quot;Inner Struggles.&quot;  As the thoroughly modern Christian (pretty amazing for a book written in 1758), Swedenborg proclaims, &quot;So you can see that inner struggles are brought on by hell and are not from heaven.  This is part of Christian belief, which says that God does not torment anyone.&quot;  (p. 71).<br />Part V, Christian Observances, has religious explanations, such as &quot;Heaven and Hell,&quot; which reflects &quot;we stay there forever,&quot; (p. 84) either way.  Part VII, Facets of Religion, tackles philosophy in Chapter 19.  &quot;But our religious philosophy by itself does not make us religious--only living by that philosophy does.  This means faith by itself does not make a religion, but living by our faith, which is kindness, does make a religion.&quot;  (p. 87).  On government, the idea, &quot;These officials should reward people who live in an orderly way, and punish people who defy law and order.&quot;  (p. 101)  There is probably a lawyer somewhere who thinks that means we should make all tax cuts permanent, and build more prisons, and his client's accountants might even agree.  &quot;Otherwise, the human race will be lost.&quot;  (p. 101).  But, &quot;Rulers who believe that they themselves have the authority are not very wise,&quot; (p. 103) which must have been how Freud felt when he wished he had written &quot;I can heartily recommend the Gestapo to anyone&quot; before he left Vienna.hristian belief, which says that God does not torment anyone.&quot;  (p. 71).<br />Part V, Christian Observances, has religious explanations, such as &quot;Heaven and Hell,&quot; which reflects &quot;we stay there forever,&quot; (p. 84) either way.

I have been reading a lot of magazines, in which the funniest thing that could relate Freud's life to our times was that he had been ask to sign something, like Americans being able to waive a few rights in order to achieve some meaningful concessions from a government which had its own ideas about the kind of order which needs to be imposed.  All Freud wanted was to leave Vienna, after \\"a gang of storm troopers did come to the apartment and confiscated $500,\\" (p. 359), \\"the Nazis moved in on the Psychoanalytic Press and arrested Martin for a day,\\" (pp. 359-360), \\"the Gestapo took Anna in for a day of questioning,\\" (p. 360), and:<br />There is a widely circulated story that before finally allowing the party to leave, the German authorities made Freud sign a document stating that he had been treated with `respect and consideration.'  It is said that he asked if he could add something, and wrote, \\"I can heartily recommend the Gestapo to anyone.\\"  This sounds like a fine bit of Freudian irony, though it would have been foolhardy to endanger so many lives on the very point of departure.  The document has subsequently been found and it contains no such comment.  Perhaps it was what Freud imagined himself writing.  (p. 360)<br />This reminds me, too much, of Nietzsche, in ECCE HOMO, complaining that Stendhal \\"took away from me the best atheistical joke that precisely I might have made\\" (Walter Kaufmann translation, p. 244).  As R. J. Hollingdale put it, in the Penguin Classics edition, \\"Perhaps I am even envious of Stendhal?  He robbed me of the best atheist joke which precisely I could have made:\\" (p. 28).  In a thoroughly comic society, any book which can precisely describe the setting for the best joke I ever read, \\"I can heartily recommend the Gestapo to anyone,\\" deserves to be read.  I hope it is this useful for everyone.	2002-10-12

This book is an interesting guide to what we now know about Kant's life, and a scholarly summary of what he might have meant in his own time and place.  Kant was the philosopher selected by Nietzsche for section 193 of THE GAY SCIENCE:  \\"Kant's joke.  Kant wanted to prove in a way that would dumfound the common man that the common man was right:  that was the secret joke of this soul.  He wrote against the scholars in favor of the popular prejudice, but for scholars and not for popularity.\\"  (THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, p. 96).  In TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS, Nietzsche named Kant in his explanation of \\"How the `true world' finally became a fable:\\" (THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, pp. 485-6).  \\"Any distinction between a `true' and an `apparent' world ~ whether in the Christian manner or in the manner of Kant (in the end, an underhanded Christian) ~ is only a suggestion of decadence, a symptom of the decline of life.\\"  (THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, p. 484).  What set Nietzsche apart from the scholars of his own day, at least as long as he was considered sane, was his willingness to display a sly contempt for the kind of clarity which any functioning society demands, which suggests that Nietzsche had some different ideas.  If anyone who wrote philosophically at the level of Kant could still be understood well enough to be called \\"an underhanded Christian,\\" it is ironic that a more modern philosopher would consider Kant \\"an embodiment on a large scale of what is wrong with philosophy\\" for the opposite reason:  \\"Suppose he had not insisted on certainty, necessity, and completeness!\\"  (Walter Kaufmann, DISCOVERING THE MIND, VOLUME ONE, GOETHE, KANT, AND HEGEL, p. 195).<br />One of the things that makes philosophy interesting is the range of ideas which it offers to anyone who is trying to think of something to say about his enemies.  Fichte was a contemporary of Kant, in trouble with the authorities from 1997 to 1800 when he was suspected of being an atheist because he thought a moral world order provided a more godly deity than the underhanded Christians of his day were used to.  This was very close to the end of Kant's life, and Kant's circle of friends consoled themselves with ideas like:  \\"The name `Fichte' means pine, and bad proofs were sometimes called `proofs of pine.'  Furthermore, to `lead someone behind the pines' could mean to be deceptive.  Some of Kant's acquaintances agreed.\\"  (Manfred Kuehn, KANT, A BIOGRAPHY, p. 391).<br />I was most interested in examining this book because it considers an early work, included in Kant's THEORETICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1755-1770, on Emanuel Swedenborg, DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER ILLUSTRATED BY DREAMS OF METAPHYSICS.  The existence of the work itself, like Freud's summary ON DREAMS (1901), drawn from Freud's on INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS (1900), shows a strong affinity for the kind of thinking about Christianity which is much closer to a modern understanding than most people would expect from the contemporaries of Kant and Swedenborg.  Kant might be much more modern than Swedenborg because he willingly states a conclusion, as \\"a matter of policy, in this as in other cases, to fit the pattern of one's plans to one's powers, and if one cannot obtain the great, to restrict oneself to the mediocre.\\"  (p. 174).

This was very close to the end of Kant's life, and Kant's circle of friends consoled themselves with ideas like:  \\"The name `Fichte' means pine, and bad proofs were sometimes called `proofs of pine.'  Furthermore, to `lead someone behind the pines' could mean to be deceptive.  Some of Kant's acquaintances agreed.\\"  (Manfred Kuehn, KANT, A BIOGRAPHY, p. 391).<br />I was most interested in examining this book because it considers an early work, included in Kant's THEORETICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1755-1770, on Emanuel Swedenborg, DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER ILLUSTRATED BY DREAMS OF METAPHYSICS.  The existence of the work itself, like Freud's summary ON DREAMS (1901), drawn from Freud's on INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS (1900), shows a strong affinity for the kind of thinking about Christianity which is much closer to a modern understanding than most people would expect from the contemporaries of Kant and Swedenborg.  Kant might be much more modern than Swedenborg because he willingly states a conclusion, as \\"a matter of policy, in this as in other cases, to fit the pattern of one's plans to one's powers, and if one cannot obtain the great, to restrict oneself to the mediocre.\\"  (p. 174).

US	44184384	R34284M5I4S5WT	9997515161	360040972	Oedipus Rex	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	This has a bold style.	This tape of a 70-minute lecture by Princeton Philosophy Professor Walter Kaufmann was recorded at a poetry center in New York City on December 2, 1963.  The death of President John F. Kennedy, which had occurred the week before, was mentioned by Walter Kaufmann in connection with his first major point about the treatment which Sophocles devised for Oedipus.  As had just happened, the experience of seeing the first of men suddenly brought down produces an unexpected insecurity in the crowd attending this play, quite extreme compared to the ideas which Aristotle had advanced about tragedy and the guidelines which Plato's Republic would impose upon poets.  The major points of the lecture are:<br />1).  man's insecurity.<br />2).  man's blindness.<br />3).  the curse of honesty.<br />4).  tragedy is inevitable.<br />5).  the problem of justice.<br />Before getting to the major points about the play, a lot is said in praise of Sophocles, who lived from 496 BCE to 406 BCE, wrote more than a hundred plays, and frequently won first prize.  Oedipus is only one of his character's who gets so angry that he no longer understands when he is told the exact truth.  In Oedipus Rex, what makes him most angry is that he wants the truth and the others want to hush things up.  Somehow this is related to the famous Freud, who in Kaufmann's book, THE FAITH OF A HERETIC, is called \\"the modern Oedipus who solved the riddle of the Sphinx and understood man's condition like no one else, was singularly blind confronted with his closest friends and followers, unable to perceive how sick they were.\\"  (p. 309).  In my notes, section 83 of THE FAITH OF A HERETIC is mentioned under the second point, blindness, when Oedipus is thoroughly spelling out the curse for hounding the villain from the homes of Thebes to rid it of the plague.  Poets and plays prior to Sophocles emphasized the family curse.  The more modern view of fate is more representative.	2002-10-12

The modern world has turned into a bunch of spellbound spectators, and Mark Crispin Miller is trying to figure out how bad things are by seriously considering those things that a thoroughly comic society would only find amusing.  Talking is not an activity which appeals to many people today.  Being in a crowd is like going to church for so many people that it shouldn't be surprising that \\"Voices Carry\\" was the first song of Til Tuesday that could be considered a hit.  The single mix version of \\"Voices Carry\\" is currently available on the Aimee Mann \\"Ultimate Collection\\" CD.  The word \\"Hush,\\" used in that song, is a euphemism for what I usually hear when I am out in public.  There are so many things that are more interesting than one person trying to say something, it is a wonder that anyone in a thoroughly soundtracked society learns to say anything without communicating an overbearing weight of strained vindictiveness.<br />Now that President George W. Bush has gotten enough on-the-job shocks to feel that he has found himself, engaged in a battle for the safety of all Americans which is so suspicious of what anyone might say, that silence it truly golden, this book, THE BUSH DYSLEXICON, might be subject to an attempt to impose a deeper meaning.  It is most unfortunate for this book that I acquired it shortly after reading THE SECRET WAR AGAINST HANOI by Richard H. Shultz, with its memory of two Kennedy brothers, starting from their most vindictive moments on Saturday morning, January 28, 1961, and thereafter.  If our future is mainly our children, the future of our government seems to be mainly the children of the people who killed President John F. Kennedy and those who plot killings using security guards, as may have been the case in the death of Bobby Kennedy.  The failure of a nuclear test ban treaty to be ratified by the U.S. Senate before this book was published in 2001 is as much as I need to know about who is exercising power now, compared to how President Kennedy saw things at the time of his death, for me to think that the killers' kids rule.  What is said in this book is what any educated person might think about the way such a particularly clique talks to each other, but talks down to everyone else.<br />Page 1 starts with the possibilities which would be most familiar to those whose expectations have been shaped by TV, a comic hit on the clique, \\"a mere commercial venture . . . taking on the latest round of flubs and pratfalls.\\"  Page 2 contains the boast, \\"As a New Yorker, I could vote safely for Ralph Nader, and I did so with a certain wary pride.\\"  I love this objection to party politics as an evil, observed by someone who thought that a governing clique might try to do more than loot the world of all its commercial possibilities:  here in Minnesota, Al Gore got less votes than Bill Clinton had, though nationally Gore received more votes than Bill Clinton ever did.  There might be a lot of books by people who were outraged by the same things Ralph Nader complained about, and an openly criminal war on drugs was a big factor in the minds of those who felt it was the political parties that get most excited about a war on anything, but never shut it off.  This book does not have an index, so it is not easy to find anything on a particular topic.  Relating as well as it does to its main topic, just about the only thing you will find in this book is George W. Bush.<br />Individuality is not what it used to be.  Highly educated people are so sensitive to the sociology of knowledge that the particular point of view of an assault on anyone who speaks publicly for a great establishment is easily dismissed.  \\"This book, you figure, must be just another snickering ad hominem attack on yet another U.S. president.\\"  (p. 1).  After a president has been subjected to impeachment proceedings for something as personal as Clinton's behavior in the White House, it does seem that people understand that kind of thing much more readily than easy subterfuge on the scale which is practiced daily by the governing clique.  Saying anything in such a situation, \\"George W. Bush is so illiterate as to turn completely incoherent when he speaks without a script or unless he thinks his every statement through so carefully beforehand that the effort empties out his face.\\"  (p. 6).  Experts on the use of the Socratic method as a teaching mechanism at Harvard might remember the experience, something that the Unabomber might remember from the psychological experiments that he endured as an undergraduate at Harvard.  Miller's remarks about the new thinking reflected obscurely in the remarks of George W. Bush merely shows how much he underestimates the ability of the ruling clique to upset the current use of smoke and mirrors:  \\"To believe that Social Security is somehow not a federal program, that the word `insurance' is mere Washington bureaucratese, . . . is to suffer from no disability but ignorance.\\"  (pp. 6-7).  Miller is not ready to have this particular rug pulled out from under him.<br />Philosophically, the idea that Bush has found an axis of evil, the one sure thing that he can rely on, seems to stand the philosophy of Nietzsche on the distinction between good and evil being primarily a judgment of the powerless, back on its head, where it has always belonged, in spite of the philosophers who contend that people might believe anything.  It isn't so, and Nietzsche couldn't just come right out and say it, but on \\"Meet the Press,\\" on April 15, 2000, George W. Bush said, \\"Laura and I really don't realize how bright our children is sometimes until we get an objective analysis.\\"  (p. 137).  Theoretically, \\"how bright\\" could be a quality that a lot of children share, and they are all that bright when how bright is the objective analysis that even Nietzsche could agree with.  People who think that issues about gay Republicans, the creation of the world, anyone who preaches hate, the wall between church and state, or books in general all deserve a deeper analysis than anything that has been said before won't learn much from this one.ly than easy subterfuge on the scale which is practiced daily by the governing clique.

US	44184384	R2NWGF5O36QQH8	1859846319	415848956	The Trial of Henry Kissinger	Books	4	3	18	N	N	Like a bad case of American anthrax	American publishing being what it is, I am sure that if Christopher Hitchens had wanted to write a book called *dirty deeds done dirt cheap* his publisher would think that a better theme and title would be THE TRIAL OF HENRY KISSINGER. Among those who consider Orwell one of the top writers of the 20th century because most people would consider his work more political than the stories of Kafka, the idea of war crimes is associated far more strongly with certain clandestine policies known only to Henry Kissinger and his team of nobodies than with anything that any German or Japanese general did in World War II. Hitchens devotes pages 25-30 to General Telford Taylor's book NUREMBERG AND VIETNAM, but these subjects hardly go together. The Nuremberg laws adopted in Germany under the direction of Adolph Hitler were about race, and the effort of the allies to enforce laws in Nuremberg of an entirely different nature after Germany was defeated was as ironic as American college professors trying to lecture about an ancient Greek tragedy called \\"Oedipus Rex.\\". Henry Kissinger was as likely to end up violating any open standard established by the Nazis in their attempt to achieve racial purity as American anthrax would be a bad powder to have in letters to U. S. politicians.<br />The most confusing thing about this book for me was the lack of a time frame which would include things at Waco, Texas, which hadn't even happened yet before Congress had abolished the right of self-defense in situations involving federal law-enforcing officers. I'm not saying that Henry Kissinger was ever, in his entire life, so lowly that he had to use his official status to try to enforce some law. There is a distinction to be made between the law itself, and anyone who is determined to use the law against you, and Henry Kissinger seems to have stayed as far from this distinction as any American official brighter than John Ashcroft would be expected to. Hitchens is far more willing to consider the possibility that \\"direct collusion in the murder of a democratic officer in a democratic and peaceful country\\" (p. 66) is a crime.<br />One thing I noticed, reading this book, that few others are likely to find as funny, is that certain things happened on April 22. Having a year in Vietnam, which I will always associate with law and the possibility of war crimes, I realized that the calendar was full of the possibility that any particular day might be the date on which a typical mortal might actually die. For Richard Nixon, April 22, 1994, was the date of his death, and I was struck at the time with the idea, or maybe it was just a joke, that this ought to be remembered as a great deleted expletive event. Hitchens writes about particular dates with his dramatic flair, \\"From his roost at Nixon's side he describes a Kissingerian moment on 15 December 1970\\" (p. 22) about having a \\"pullout right at the fall of '72 so that if any bad results follow they will be too late to affect the election.\\"  I had my own, personal interest in this timing, which seems to be far more important than any criminal intent, and nothing in the Nuremberg trials established that a war would be criminal for bad timing if it occurred during my lifetime, while I was a draftee in the U. S. Army, under my feet, over my head, or all around me.<br />What can we learn about April 22 from this book? \\"It only got better. On 22 April 1970, Haldeman reports that Nixon, following Kissinger into a National Security Council meeting on Cambodia, `turned back to me with a big smile and said \\"K[issinger]'s really having fun today, he's playing Bismarck.\\" ' \\" (p. 37). \\"He was able to make a dramatic appearance on Capitol Hill on 22 April 1971, at a hearing held by Senator Edward Kennedy's Senate Subcommittee on Refugees.\\" (p. 39). A mere year after Kissinger's \\" ' \\"fun,\\" ' \\" Fred Branfman was able to show Congress and \\"the State Department's envoy, William Sullivan, a former ambassador to Laos . . . that Laotiansociety was being mutilated by ferocious aerial bombardment.\\" (p. 39). Even after negotiating a peace agreement with three Vietnamese parties to the conflict, signed in January, 1973, and \\"even after the Nixon--Kissinger administration had undertaken on Capitol Hill not to intensify the raids, there was a 21 percent increase of the bombing of Cambodia in the months July-August 1973. The Air Force maps of the targeted areas show them to be, or to have been, densely populated.\\" (p. 38). Richard Nixon lived for twenty years after this, and Kissinger might be so old now that any of this must seem like reckless activities of his younger days, when his telephone calls included messages from Nixon's drunk friend, Bebe, who might have been joking.

US	44184384	RAF0POZ9ZLQ85	0786868783	330116058	Massacre at the Palace	Books	4	5	39	N	N	Doomed is not being too critical	Drug use warning:  The religious context of this book is Nepal, and the author, Jonathan Gregson, is likely to describe the Hindu temple attendants in Kathmandu as being stoned, a stunning departure from purity in a book about a curse that is described as:  \\"It is also about ritual purity and, strange to say, the symbiotic relationship between cows and kings.\\"  (p. 6).<br />I might have given up on this book, already, but it is difficult to decide.  The most modern aspect of our global situation faced in this book is the enormously destructive power of modern weapons, but the psychological potential to find something beyond mere entertainment in the use of such tools of sudden destruction keeps being thwarted by shock.  What was really great might already be lost.  A lot of intellectual activity seems most meaningful when it still creates the impression that it is going someplace.  It might be unsettling to readers and shoppers searching for modern consumer items, contemplating momentary enjoyment of the best that this market has to offer, that the best items available should be evaluated as historical artifacts, more meaningful as a memory in a lifetime that has already registered these deaths as part of the problems encountered in going with the flow.  Could anything be worse than now, when shoppers merely contemplate them as objects that might be produced by prospective expenditures?  This ought to make at least as much sense as page 16 of the New Republic of October 7, 2002, which quotes Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, telling my U.S. Senator, Mark Dayton of Minnesota, \\"What's different is three thousand people were killed!\\"  Would this particular consumer item be worth less, if the only people who had ever been killed in Kathmandu's royal palace one day were Nepal's royal family?<br />There is no index in this book, but it is unlikely that an index would have listed all the entries for cows, anyway.  The first chapter is called \\"Of Cows and Kings,\\" and the religious background for this book includes a curse on Prithvi Narayan Shah, the first king of the Royal family, which has ruled Nepal since 1769.  \\"According to a legend that is as old as the Kingdom of Nepal,\\"  (p. 4)  Gorakhnath was a Hindu sage, \\"and he lived only on milk, butter, and curd, the product of Hinduism's sacred cows.\\"  (p. 5).  The story reminds me of a joke about cows which was fully explained by Calvin Trillin in a column called \\"Uncivil Liberties\\" (The Nation, 11/21/1988, p. 518).  During the Iowa primary campaign, Trillin tried to suggest how the contest was overly sensitive to agricultural issues, and he later had to eat his words.  \\"I would like to say in the most direct way possible that Michael Dukakis was never under the impression that you have to kill a cow to get the cheese.  George Bush never said that the life of dairy farmers is particularly hard because they're often required to milk right through the cocktail hour.\\"  In response to his critics, Trillin wrote, \\"For those of you whose letters indicate that you see nothing at all strange about the proposition that you have to kill a cow to get the cheese, all I can say is that you ought to think about getting out a little more.\\"  This history of the doomed royal dynasty of Nepal applies that thinking to just about anyone who can't decide how much they should care about cows.  High-caste Hindus in the Himalayas \\"had chosen to go into exile rather than live under beef-eating Muslims\\" (MASSACRE AT THE PALACE, p. 7) in India, but the army with which it had originally conquered Nepal included many warrior tribes, including beef-eaters.  When there was gunfire in the Royal Palace of Nepal, it was usually \\"the crown prince practicing on one of the firing ranges, or blasting off at cats, bats, rats, crows, or just about anything else that moved.\\"  (p. ix).  Stories about deer hunters who shoot a cow are usually about a mistake, or some kind of joke, and this book searches through history asif there must be some other possible explanation.<br />For the royal family, modern times brought an inability to tell what mattered.  \\"The king had to walk a fine line between his own liberal views and the minimum requirements of a Hindu monarch.  He had little time for caste divisions nor, for that matter, the issue of cow slaughter, which is firmly linked with the Gorakhnath cult and is still a live issue today.\\"  (p. 113).  It was not obvious what path would be best for the future, and the royal family was becoming too interested in personal fulfillment to offer realistic alternatives for Nepal or even for history.  This is a serious book.  Once you start reading it, you ought to be thinking about why it matters.if there must be some other possible explanation.<br />For the royal family, modern times brought an inability to tell what mattered.  \\"The king had to walk a fine line between his own liberal views and the minimum requirements of a Hindu monarch.

The distinction between philosophy and ideology is the mystery which makes this book interesting.  &quot;Ideology, Napolean asserted, was abstract speculation divorced from reality.  With Napoleon the term *ideology* thus acquired a perjorative meaning that challenged philosophy's traditional sovereignty.  To call philosophy `ideology' was now to say it was ineffective in the world.  It operated in a dream world of abstraction.&quot;  (p. 5).<br />The government of Germany, back in the early 1840s, was not based on elections depending on ideology to determine policies conforming to the will of those who were governed, and France, at the time of Napoleon, might be considered the greatest failure in Europe of the use of revolution to establish a government of the people.  Translating anything that this book is about into practical politics is probably beyond the capacity of what Mark Crispin Miller called TV in THE BUSH DYSLEXICON (see &quot;But there is now very little place for . . .&quot; p. 64 of Miller).  The thing I like about Harold Mah's book, THE END OF PHILOSOPHY, THE ORIGIN OF &quot;IDEOLOGY&quot;/KARL MARX AND THE CRISIS OF THE YOUNG HEGELIANS is that he gets the picture right from the religious perspective, which is a minor aspect of the book.  The distinctions between followers of Hegel were religious as well as political:<br />If God as spirit developed by embodying itself in the mind of humanity and the institutions of the present, then this was entirely at odds with the Christian notion of a transcendent God who promised fulfillment in an afterlife.  The debate over Hegel's supposed pantheism and whether or not his philosophy disallowed the possibility of immortality raged throughout the 1830s.  In 1835, the publication of David Friedrich Strauss's LIFE OF JESUS radically transformed the controversy.  Up to then, Hegelians had attempted to reconcile Christianity and philosophy, a transcendent God and immanent spirit.  But Strauss asserted that reconciliation was no longer possible . . . (p. 37)<br />As Strauss himself later noted, the controversy over his book brought about yet another alignment in the Hegelian school.  Orthodox or &quot;right&quot; Hegelians continued to cling to the conventional Hegelian view of the substantive compatibility of Christianity and philosophy.  &quot;Center&quot; Hegelians tried to reach a compromise, asserting that some aspects of the two forms of consciousness could be reconciled.  &quot;Left&quot; or Young Hegelians accepted Strauss's rejection of Christianity and his humanism.  (p. 37).<br />That much of the book is really clear to me, and a good place to start a biography which ends with the thought:<br />The theory of ideology strives to remedy the intellectual's sense of being severed from the real world.  Its formulation is his attempt to come to terms with a world that has forsaken him.  (p. 229)<br />Then there are notes from page 231 to 279, citing a lot of original sources.  By the time I got to the index, I was looking for things that weren't there.  Fichte is only mentioned on one page, with a line of poetry that Karl Marx wrote:<br />Kant and Fichte soar to heavens blue . . .

A picture even shows him playing a \\"guitar during a meeting of his prayer group from the Chapel Woods Presbyterian Church in Decatur, Georgia.\\"  Someone who was six years old when Chapman shot John Lennon in 1980 would have been 18 in 1992, when this book was published, and decided to remain a nobody in American society, could have been 25 in 1999 and taken part in the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  A real nobody wouldn't have known that the bombs were falling on an embassy, and nobody would really be held responsible, either, because everybody wants to maintain their rights to be nobody.  The frightening thing about this book is its consideration of options for anyone to be somebody in a global society which encompasses millions of people in the United States and billions in the world.  There are pages in this book about drug use.  Is this book the reason that so many more people in our prisons are serving time for drugs than back in 1980, when some people were surprised that John Lennon was shot?	2002-10-02

There is an index, but it does not have a listing for triple cross thinking (covered mainly at the end of the \\"Going North\\" Chapter).  The index is more helpful on the Counterinsurgency, Counterintelligence, Covert action, Covert operations, and Covert paramilitary campaign (listed topics) thinking which finally produced the triple cross operation.  Without trying to explain how numerous officials in the United States were supposed to approve everything that was being done to create the kind of revolution which superpower thinking truly wanted, in their effort to make the people with power in North Vietnam think that an internal Sacred Sword of the Patriots League considered itself to be potentially more popular than the government of North Vietnam, a more recent approach to understanding this guide might consider how well this guide would work as a plan for triple cross activities, possibly including elections, elected officials, and the courts, to convince people in the United States that a Sacred Sword of the Patriots League had successfully taken over government operations in the United States of America.  Specific comments in this book about the triple cross:<br />Could SOG create a triple-cross system to convince Hanoi that, in fact, it had uncovered only part of a much larger and more intricate subversion operation inside its borders?  (p. 93).<br />The triple cross was not just against Hanoi but also \\"against our compatriots,\\" noted the chief of OP 34, who was convinced that the STD was infiltrated by enemy intelligence.

US	44184384	R3445KOJU6YY96	039914871X	934933413	The Secrets of Inchon: The Untold Story of the Most Daring Covert Mission of the Korean War	Books	4	8	9	N	N	History, and a lot about boats.	This is a great story. Most of it takes place in the few weeks preceding the U.N. landing of troops at Inchon in September, 1950, only a few months after the Korean war started. The author, Gene Clark, was supposed to send as much information as possible to Tokyo prior to the landing date. Fortunately, he was highly aware of many aspects of such operations from his previous service in the American invasion of Okinawa in 1945. In 1948, he served as an interpreter at Japanese war crimes trials on Guam, and his account of his weeks in Korea is filled with information about how well ideas were translated from one language into another. A short paragraph in which he quotes himself is capable of showing how quickly his mind operates on many levels in the midst of complex situations, thusly:<br />\\"Can't we get some clothes for these men, Kim? And get that doctor to take care of those splinters right away,\\" I directed. Min's back and arms were a bloody mess. We couldn't afford to have this man hospitalized. (p. 150).<br />That's from a page in the middle of the book, where the 15 pictures are located. Back in 1950, Gene Clark was not transmitting pictures in his reports to Tokyo. His radio communications were quite limited, and a lot of the spying took place after dark. Even the picture of his ten men on the island about eleven miles from Inchon, showing Clark with his shoulder holster and Youn standing \\"with the pistol in his belt,\\" doesn't use the nicknames which were constantly used in the story \\"in case they were captured by the Communists.\\" (p. 18). Clark had a knack for picking names for his top buddies that could be confused for major Asian figures: Yong Chi Ho and Kim Nam Sun. My confusion about which Kim was part of this story was greatest on page 129, after a digression about \\"a certain doom for more than a hundred of the innocent peaceful inhabitants of Taemuui-do, sacrificed on the blood-drenched altar of Communism to the ambitions of the traitorous and false Korean prophet, Kim Il Sung, the Soviets' puppet president of North Korea,\\" as related to Clark by Kim after his interrogation of the mother of Political Officer Yeh of the North Korean People's Republic. Yeh had been assigned to impose order and collect rice for the Red High Command on an island a mere five miles from where Clark was able to observe things like, \\"Down the beach, a sampan was shuttling back and forth between beach and junk, landing the people from Taemuui-do.\\" (p. 128). Yeh's father had been a close friend of Kim Il Sung and had been captured and later executed by the South Korean counterintelligence organization for which Kim Nam Sung had previously worked, \\"But Syngman Rhee had fired him for failing to predict the North Korean invasion.\\" (p. 24). The attempt to capture Yeh to extract whatever information he might have about Red High Command intentions on the defense of Inchon is barely plausible, but it was an exciting episode.<br />General of the Army Douglas MacArthur is mentioned a number of times in this book. There is no index, so this will not be an easy source to use for those who are looking for details about how well General MacArthur did in 1950, but a picture of how pleased he was, sitting on the bridge of the USS Mount McKinley on September 15, and walking ashore on September 17, are great evidence of this operation's success. The Epilogue, written by another after this manuscript was revealed by Clark's surviving family members in 2000, gives Clark the credit for flashing \\"earthshaking news to headquarters in Tokyo\\" (p. 324) from islands in the mouth of the Yalu River at the end of October, 1950. A million Chinese troops, with human wave tactics that are easy to imagine, after the number of casualties that begin to mount up in the actions reported in this book, changed the situation enough to confine the UN army mainly to South Korea. In noting the medals won by Gene Clark, the Navy Cross which he received for an action behind enemy lines in early 1951, escorting Brigadier General Crawford Sams, a doctor, to determine if Chinese troops were dying of bubonic plague, which might have required \\"the daunting task of vaccinating their entire army against the plague,\\" (p. 325) seems most modern.es in early 1951, escorting Brigadier General Crawford Sams, a doctor, to determine if Chinese troops were dying of bubonic plague, which might have required \\"the daunting task of vaccinating their entire army against the plague,\\" (p. 325) seems most modern.	2002-10-01

Don't ask me why I would consider this book just a political primer, though the title, A GRAND DELUSION/AMERICA'S DESCENT INTO VIETNAM suggests that the bottom of anything was not America's initial position.  I took a look at the Books portion of the Bibliography on pages 791-7, in which the top seemed to be a long way from Nam, starting with the book by Jonathan Aitken listed first, which is NIXON:  A LIFE, and then the two books by Stephen E. Ambrose also have titles which start with that famous name, NIXON.  Is it funny if a nickname might be spelled the same way as the abbreviation at the beginning of the title of the book by Louis Baldwin last on page 791, HON. POLITICIAN:  MIKE MANSFIELD OF MONTANA?  as in, Hon who?  As jokes about Nam go, this might not be as funny as anything I could ever say in a review about my Hosea knock, knock joke, which might get to be more than offensive with each book that I might try to relate it to.  In the case of Nam, all my knock knock jokes (Stella who? Stella nutter Hon. Politician?) ought to relate to how many Vietnamese were knocking on America's door, pleading for American forces to drop more bombs someplace in Asia.<br />The Introduction, on pages 1-5, with its concise list of key lessons, possibly overexerts itself in showing how capable it is of shocking readers who don't think that democracy automatically means peaceful.  When things go wrong, all hell breaking loose shoves us into the realization of how, both evenly and oddly, a mind can assert possibilities like, \\"Without a war in Vietnam and the political turmoil it sparked, it is unlikely that Richard Nixon, and perhaps even Ronald Reagan, would have been elected president.\\"  (p. 2).  In following Mann's attempt to illustrate a web of delusions, myths and illusions, and how they had their way with us, I counted more than a dozen uses of the word \\"political,\\" three uses of policy, politics, and election or elections in the Introduction.  Other key words seemed to be:  apathetic, democratic ideals, electorate, issue, legacy, partisan, politically, policies, promises, and voters.  The Prologue, about Senator Frank Church, on pages 7-18, attempts to show that, strictly speaking, Senator Church should not be considered a pacifist or isolationist, a position which had been popular out in Idaho and still made a certain amount of sense before 1939.  History used to be different, but in February, 1965, it was American bombs which \\"would fall on North Vietnam for the next three-and-a-half-years.\\"  (p. 9).  In that context, Senator Church was likely to be called anything for using the word, \\"self-defeating,\\" (p. 10) and whatever his intellectual powers and logic, \\"negotiations\\" (p. 11) weren't being considered as a solution to whatever problem Vietnam became in the:  Knock, knock, Who's there? situation of those years.<br />Big books on the subject of Vietnam, like Robert McNamara's, constantly surprise me in the number of things they do not know.  In this book, I think the numbers are particularly bad for November, 1946, when I was about to be born.  As reported by Robert Mann, \\"In November, the French shelled the northern city of Haiphong -- then under Vietminh control -- and killed several hundred Vietnamese civilians.\\"  (p. 69).  This did not generate any news reports in the United States at the time it happened, so it isn't surprising that modern history is a bit vague about how much bombardment took place.  Back in 1967, THE UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM by George McTurnan Kahin and John W. Lewis claimed, \\"The mounting tension culminated on November 23 with the French naval bombardment of Haiphong, where at least 6,000 Vietnamese civilians were killed.  The Vietminh retaliated by launching coordinated attacks against the French in Hanoi, which touched off major hostilities.\\"  (Kahin, p. 27).  As far as the civilians who died on November 23, 1946, were concerned, this might have been more like being one of the civilians in the Pentagonon September 11, 2001, than the people from all over the world in the twin towers that day, since the people of Haiphong in 1946 were overwhelmingly not French.  The dispute was about control of the customs of the port, and I have read that it was the Chinese section of Haiphong which was shelled, targeting the merchant class more than the indigenous Vietnamese.  Perhaps the French should ask Osama bin Laden how they ever could have done that?  I thought it might be good for me to read this book, in case it ever looks like the United States might get into some war for the sake of some former friends who now might be turning against us, and who might be impressed by a similar attack in their part of the world, but it isn't obvious from this book that such an attack would be a good idea.on September 11, 2001, than the people from all over the world in the twin towers that day, since the people of Haiphong in 1946 were overwhelmingly not French.

This is the kind of book that makes me feel my own personal reactions the most.  The other big books on veterans, LONG TIME PASSING and UNWINDING THE VIETNAM WAR, were more about personal recovery.  I consider NAM by Mark Baker a small book, more about the nature of the war than about who was there.  As Mark Baker tells it, \\"I only understand Vietnam as though it were a story.  It's not like it happened to me.\\"  This book, HOME TO WAR, is about real people who found themselves back in the United States.  One of them in the Prologue, Phil Gioia, mayor of Corte Madera, has a weird dream.  \\"In the dream, I realize, `Wait a minute.  Those guys are all dead.  They died a long time ago.'  And that's when I wake up.\\"  (p. 12).  This book jumps right into the politics of the situation.<br />Politically, the guys that this book is about weren't accomplishing much on their own, so they tried to support Senator Eugene McCarthy in his run for president early in 1968.  At least McCarthy wanted an end to the war in Vietnam, and that's what they wanted.  \\"On March 12, McCarthy stunned the nation by winning 20 of New Hampshire's 24 convention delegates.\\"  (p. 30).  That month, Larry Rottmann, who had been wounded in the Tet offensive, was discharged from the Army.  Then he spent a week in Wisconsin working for McCarthy.  When they went to Indiana, \\"Rottman was in charge of a group of vets that followed Kennedy around in order to wave their McCarthy placards in his face every time he spoke to the media.\\"  (p. 30).  Robert Kennedy was then a Senator from New York, formerly Attorney General of the United States and popular enough to get \\"42 percent of the vote in Indiana, compared to McCarthy's 27 percent.  Rottmann took his group of vets to the airport in Lincoln, Nebraska, to await Kennedy's arrival for the primary there.  Exasperated to see the same guys in his face once again, Kennedy confronted Rottmann and demanded, `Why are you working against me?'  Rottmann replied that they weren't . . .\\"  (p. 30).  They were just trying to remind him that some people \\"simply found McCarthy `more down-to-earth and more sincere, both in his politics and in his lifestyle.'  Kennedy evidently failed to appreciate Rottmann's point of view; he restated his dismay that Vietnam veterans weren't campaigning on his behalf instead of McCarthy's.\\"  (p. 30).  It can be embarrassing to try to tell a frontrunner what the multitude of radicals really think, when the idea that they all think gets this fuzzy.  Elections are too important to let the candidates who are best politically, with their illusion that they agree with everybody, think that anyone really cares about them.  Another President Kennedy might have been able to end the Vietnam war at that time by letting the Pope tell him how, and a lot of people thought that he would, until \\"... Sirhan Sirhan aimed a pistol at his head, taking him out of politics forever and enshrining him as one more dead American hero.\\"  (p. 31).  I'm not sure that the bullet in Robert Kennedy's head came from Sirhan Sirhan, since a security guard was behind Kennedy and a lot more shots were fired than Sirhan Sirhan's pistol could manage, but this book is more about perceptions than about what was actually going on, and the police in Los Angeles, California, typically take a pretty simple view of what was going on, as well as taking as much of the evidence as they could get their hands on.  HOME TO WAR isn't supposed to be about a war in the United States between the police and people who are politically active, but pages 33 on to 36, about \\"what a battlefield Chicago was destined to become that August,\\" show how much it helped veterans realize \\"that lying on a big scale had become the American way of life, and it was just such lying that had kept the war going, and going nowhere, for so many years.\\"<br />Finally, on page 59, \\"VVAW was just beginning to initiate the `rap groups,' which were groups of veterans sitting around in a room and confiding to one another the most troubling aspects of both their military service and their experiences in coming home from the war.  Toward the end of 1970, Al Hubbard would bring in two psychiatrists, Chaim Shatan and Robert Jay Lifton, to guide the discussions.\\"  (p. 59).  It isn't too surprising that, with all this introspection, the political situation came to reflect a deeper shudder, with the participation of guys who had served in graves registration, who \\"naturally gravitated toward the crazies.\\"  (p. 120).

Douglas climbing mountains is one of its dramatic themes.  The most interesting part of the book for me was how much trouble Justice Douglas could create for the rest of the U. S. Supreme Court and those who believe that law ought to conform to their ideal of an orderly administration of justice.  In the middle of June, 1953, Justice Douglas issued a stay of execution for Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, thinking, \\"The Rosenbergs' indictment, trial and sentence had been under the wrong law, the Espionage Act of 1917. ... And under the Atomic Energy Act, a judge could impose the death penalty only on the recommendation of the jury and only with a showing that the offense had been committed with intent to injure the United States.\\"  (p. 306).  Then \\"Justice Douglas left Washington and headed west by car, thinking that his stay would remain in effect until the full Court could hear arguments during the fall term.\\"  (p. 307).  Justice Robert Jackson \\"suggested that his stay was an attempt to play to his liberal constituency with a popular solo performance.\\"  (p. 299).  Justice Jackson's law clerk, William H. Rehnquist had written a three-page memorandum in which the political context was considered:<br />... the public opinion which has voiced itself in favor of the Rosenbergs is not even properly called `left-wing' in the sense that the respectable liberal group in this country is behind it.  It is a tiny minority of lunatic fringers and erratic scientist-sentimentalists.  (p. 303).<br />Justice Jackson was willing to hear the Rosenberg case so \\"the Court would save itself embarrassment and put to rest any doubts about the fairness of the Rosenberg trial\\" (p. 303) when Douglas had threatened to issue a memorandum \\"agreeing with the Court of Appeals that some of the conduct on the United States Attorney was `wholly reprehensible',\\" (p. 302) but Douglas wasn't willing to act in the case until he found some reason to believe that the Rosenbergs might be able to win.  On June 19, \\"When it was clear that a Court majority would not uphold the stay under any conditions, Justice Burton cast his vote with the majority, making the vote six to three.\\"  (p. 310).  The Court's decision was, \\"The Atomic Energy Act did not repeal or limit the provisions of the Espionage Act.  Accordingly, we vacate the stay entered by Mr. Justice Douglas on June 17, 1953.\\"  June 19 must have been a Friday, because \\"Out of respect for the Jewish Sabbath, the scheduled execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg on the evening of June 19 was moved up from the original 11:00 p.m. time\\" so it was all over by 8:16 p.m.  (p. 311).  Justices Black, Frankfurter and Douglas wrote dissenting opinions which \\"made a shambles of the majority's easy conclusions.\\"  (p. 311).  That should be pretty easy to do, for anyone who was born with a brain and isn't afraid to be considered one of the lunatic fringers.elieve that the Rosenbergs might be able to win.

The surprising ending to the selection is:<br />The description of my illness must not give a wrong impression.  I am not forgetting that all my suffering was truly alleviated.  All the complaining and desperate phrases that I have reported here must be understood against the background of the fundamental situation:  the certainty of being loved and of love itself.  (pp. 534-5).<br />Jaspers was born in 1883, so the diary entries from 1903 and 1904 were his state of mind at the age of 20, and even later, he must have still been feeling like an invalid for the entry of February 15, 1907, when he was at least 24 and wrote &quot;The future confronts me like a mountain which I cannot climb over.&quot;  (p. 533).  The greatest thing about his condition was, &quot;I could do no military service.&quot;  (p. 534).  Being isolated from that might have actually helped him reach the aforesaid conclusion.	2002-09-14

Often in this book, Richard Rorty is able to comment on reactions that other philosophers had to things that he had previously written.  On the topic of truth, each philosopher must be attempting to state things that the others had assumed but wouldn't say themselves, and I suspect this mainly because page 1 already has something to say about advanced thinkers, \\"like believers in universal human rights, know what is really going on.\\"  It is quite a future we have been having since this book came out in 1998, with games involving secret particles causing America to complain that thousands of specially designed high-strength aluminum tubes present a danger to civilization in recent months.  These tubes might be a sign of \\"Iraqi interest in acquiring nuclear arms.\\"  [Michael R. Gordon and Judith Miller in NEW YORK TIMES, 09/08/2002 or so].<br />In the chapter of this book, \\"The End of Leninism,\\" Rorty attempts to see the need our future, which somehow is here already, has for some rhetoric.  \\"But unless some new metanarrative eventually replaces the Marxist one, we shall have to characterize the source of human misery in such untheoretical and banal ways as `greed,' `selfishness,' and `hatred.'\\"  (p. 235).  I'm amazed at how quickly the economic thinking of our time adopted the assumption that sustainable human life would be part of a system in which each life might be required to be economically responsible for paying whatever cost would be associated with providing whatever power and water might be necessary to sustain its existence.  Even aluminum tubes might play some part in economic self-sufficiency, but people who do their thinking for the governments on this planet seem unlikely to think so.<br />\\"The End of Leninism\\" is the chapter of this book in which Rorty discusses a comic frame suggested by Kenneth Burke in the book ATTITUDES TOWARD HISTORY in 1936.  Rorty, in assuming intentional acts by those \\"butchers who have presided over the slaughter-benches of history ~ people like Hadrian and Attila, Napoleon and Stalin, Hitler and Mao\\" (p. 241) fails to demonstrate how the politics of Chairman Mao is particularly apt for such a vivid appreciation of how we now make much ado over deaths which political subordinates chose not to make a big deal of, but which are now seen as highly political.  Even Stalin and Hitler might be ironically considered worse now than when they actually had the power to do what they are now merely condemned for.  Rorty seems puzzled by Burke's simple statement, \\"Comedy requires the maximum of forensic complexity.\\"  (p. 241, ATTITUDES TOWARD HISTORY, p. 42).  If people couldn't complain about these things now, down to the smallest detail, they would not seem so funny.  What Burke means by complexity might be illustrated best by his statement, \\"The best of Bentham, Marx, and Veblen is high comedy.\\"  (p. 241, ATTITUDES TOWARD HISTORY, p. 42).  Rorty is concerned about seeing these people \\"as people who help us understand how we tricked ourselves in the past rather than as people who tell us the right thing to do in the future.\\"  (p. 242).  This would be great if someone figured out how to do the future of September 11, 2001 without any \\"apocalyptical talk of `crisis' and `endings,' less inclined toward eschatology.\\"  (p. 242).

People who can't remember whether Richard Brautigan is alive or dead should read this book to remove all doubt. This book was in a notebook that Brautigan finished on June 28, 1982 with thanks for the notebook and pens that he bought on January 30, 1982, his 47th birthday. Some of it isn't pleasant. Already on February 6, 1982, he wrote, \\"In my Top 40 of terrible things to do in my life is flying with a hangover.\\" (p. 50). There is a big gap, with no entries dated between March 2, 1982, and June 22, 1982 when he was busy in Montana teaching writing for the spring quarter \\"at a local university.\\" (p. 70). One of the things that makes the book so sad is that he thinks the reader really wants to know how he broke his leg, and he finally admits, \\"I fell over a very intelligent piece of furniture in my hotel room.\\" (p. 74). He didn't want to be writing so much about himself. He was trying to figure out something about a woman. \\"I think she was in her early forties, but I do not know her exact age and probably never will. I guess it wouldn't make that much difference in the long run. She's very dead.\\" (p. 78). Everything from then on seems to be nearer the end. June 28, 1982 has a lot of \\"Continuing\\" entries, including his advice to a former writing student, \\"I told her to write about the things she knows about.\\" (p. 106). His own lapses are only too obvious when he writes about rereading \\"to find out where I was when I stopped writing and lapsed into so many short and painfully embarrassing longer lapses.\\" (p. 107). I really shouldn't have told you about how he broke his leg. It is that kind of thing that makes anyone's use of the word \\"intelligent\\" highly suspect.	2002-08-25

I have been using this book for years, but I never had to learn anything that is in this book, being so amateur in philosophy that I don't have to trouble myself with the ideas for which most of the people in this book have become famous.  I have usually expected things to be much simpler than the information which this book has to offer.  It has nice definitions of some Greek and Latin words that I find meaningful, once I know what they are supposed to be about.  On the Hebrew source of the word \\"Gehenna,\\" the place used for \\"the city dump of Jerusalem\\" where fires burned constantly, the extra information, \\"according to tradition, [first-born] children had been sacrificed there to the god Moloch,\\" provides a lot of insight into its use in The New Testament, where the King James Version often uses \\"hell.\\"<br />For years, this book was my main source of information on Giordano Bruno (1548-1600).  I suspect that it is right about \\"he was condemned to death, and burned alive in the Campo Dei Fiori on February 17, 1600.\\"  I have tried to make sense of a few of Bruno's books, like THE EXPULSION OF THE TRIUMPHANT BEAST, but I'm inclined to accept the list of main ideas in this dictionary as the sum of his accomplishments.  Dying for the idea that \\"The universe is infinite\\" makes more sense than some of his monads, and \\"To consider reality in its multiplicity\\" is an achievement that I can appreciate.<br />On the other hand, the entry for Paul Tillich (1886-1965) illustrates a theologian's ability to distinguish \\"between three forms of reasoning~heteronymous, autonomous, and theonomous.\\"  I thought heteronymous would be pretty good, but Tillich thought that even \\"Autonomous reason takes its principles from within, but thereby reveals itself as vacuous and tautological.\\"  Being able to accept that Tillich would say that is part of being able to appreciate what this book is all about.  I'm not saying that these guys are always right about anything.	2002-08-24

A. by John Dos Passos, as a soldier in Vietnam, in June and July of 1969.  Reading the two earlier volumes on America's lofty aims and actual experiences in World War One and the economic boom which followed it in the United States helped me try to imagine what my life would be like, as I faced growing old in a country which increasingly depended upon its global dominance for its style of life.  Volume 3, THE BIG MONEY, ended this gigantic series with a political point of view that stuck with me more than any of the fictional parts of this novel.  A look at the Contents in the sample pages gives some indication of the other tidbits in this trilogy, Newsreels, popular songs, and short bioographies, which make the composition of this trilogy unique.<br />Of the biographies, I would consider \\"The Bitter Drink\\" on Veblen the most intellectual item in THE BIG MONEY, and my best introduction to how Socrates ended up drinking the hemlock.  Most biographies were about people who were so famous that they might still be remembered.  \\"Tin Lizzie\\" is a life of Henry Ford.  \\"Poor Little Rich Boy\\" was William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper owner whose father died in Washington, a senator, but who was only elected to the House of Representatives, where he justified his politics with, \\"you know where I stand on personal fortunes, but isn't it better that I should represent in this country the dissatisfied than have somebody else do it who might not have the same real property relations that I have?\\"  However familiar this might sound today, Dos Passos wrote that \\"his affairs were in such a scramble he had trouble borrowing a million dollars, and politically he was ratpoison.\\"  The biography of Hearst is at page 375 in the paperback which is currently available, a few pages after \\"The Camera Eye (50) they have clubbed us off the streets\\" (p. 371) which says:<br />America our nation has been beaten by strangers who have turned our language inside out who have taken the clean words our fathers spoke and made them slimy and foul<br />their hired men sit on the judge's bench they sit back with their feet on the tables under the dome of the State House they are ignorant of our beliefs they have the dollars the guns the armed forces the powerplants<br />they have built the electricchair and hired the executioner to throw the switch<br />The final nonfiction biography in THE BIG MONEY is called \\"Power Superpower\\" on page 420.  Samuel Insull had been learning shorthand \\"and jotting down the speeches in PARLIAMENT for the papers\\" before he came to American in 1881 to be Edison's personal secretary.  As president of Chicago Edison Company after 1892, \\"If anybody didn't like what Samuel Insull did he was a traitor.\\"  The part I liked best was after the stockmarket crash, when there were accounting problems involving a number of companies.  \\"He held directorates in eightyfive companies, he was chairman of sixtyfive, president of eleven:  it took him three hours to sign his resignations.\\"  When \\"Revolt against the moneymanipulators was in the air,\\" he ran off and extradition proceedings involved at least four countries to bring him back to Chicago for a trial.  So, \\"With voices choked with emotion headliners of Chicago business told from the witnessstand how much Insull had done for business in Chicago.  There wasn't a dry eye in the jury.\\"  The result was different from the trial of Socrates in Athens a few thousand years earlier, and I think Insull had a better retirement than Socrates asked his friends to provide if they had to pay a fine for him.  Maybe we are better off than some people.

It includes English translations by nine other poets, but most (33) of the 60 poems in this book have been translated by A. D. P. Briggs, who has devoted four books to Pushkin and has also edited four other volumes in the Everyman's Poetry series.  Briggs also revised Chapter 8 of Oliver Elton's translation of Yevgeny Onegin, which he describes in the Introduction as, \\"A few stanzas from the end of the novel are included here in order to give a general impression of how the novel works.\\"  (p. xvii).  Poem 16, \\"The Caucasus\\" is credited to F. Cornford on pages xxi and 19, but the Acknowledgements on page 104 credits a book, POEMS FROM THE RUSSIAN (1943), \\"trans. Frances Cornfield [this mistake might be due to the enormous number of actual cornfields that currently exist on this planet] and Esther Polianowski.\\"  Of the Pushkin poems translated by C. M. Bowra in a book from 1948, eight poems are included in this book.<br />The Contents lists the titles of the poems, and the Introduction explains poetic qualities which the translations in this volume attempt to match, \\"partly to ensure that interesting formal properties like these are not lost.\\"  (p. xv).  The first paragraph on page xvi attempts to show how the poems \\"are grouped roughly thematically,\\" into the order in which the themes are encountered in the first poem in this book, \\"Winter.  What shall we do out in the country?\\"  Pushkin's major themes are identified as the personal, the natural world, poetry, love, some poems of ideas, and his poems on those topics comprise the first half of the book.  The longer works in the final portion of the book include the concluding stanzas of YEVGENY ONEGIN (which has 366 stanzas altogether), Chapter 8, Stanzas 33-51.<br />The poems \\"Remembrance\\" and \\"Elegy\\" are mentioned as examples of a Pushkinian philosophy of life.  Thoughts \\"Settle in limpid twilight languidly distilled,\\" as the third line of the poem \\"Remembrance\\" puts it.  Pushkin is capable of other feats, and the introduction observes that one long poem, \\"(known in Russian as `Gavriiliada' after the angel Gabriel) is an overtly sacreligious re-enactment of several Bible stories (Adam and Eve, Joseph and Mary, the Annunciation, etc.) run together into an extended sexual romp.\\"  (p. xviii).  This kind of thing is usually considered a catastrophe, as far as serious philosophy is concerned, and \\"In its day Pushkin could not acknowledge authorship; neither could Russian criticism until recently.\\"  (p. xviii).  It reminds me of the poem, \\"the boys i mean are not refined,\\" by e. e. cummings, which was only included in a limited edition of nine copies of his book, NO THANKS, in 1935, but was dropped in subsequent editions until after his death in 1962.  Similarly, the introduction by A. D. P. Briggs notices Pushkin's use of \\"swearwords in `The Waggon of Life',\\" (p. xix) which Briggs called, \\"language unusable until recent times in both Russia and England.\\"  (p. xvii).  Anything that I might say about such language might be considered totally off the subject here, but a revisionist view of the relationship between poetry and philosophy might make some personal comments appropriate here.<br />As author of the unpublished, unedited, and largely unwritten MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK, any claim that I might make to knowledge of philosophy is highly suspect, similarly to the status achieved by Martin Heidegger when he is considered the Nazi philosopher.  In my case, the must dubious aspect of convergence might be expressed by using the phrase *peace with honor* instead of any swearword that might appear.  This could be catastrophic for the poetic values involved, but purely for philosophical reasons, I would like to insert *peace with honor* in place of the swearwords in Pushkin's poem, \\"The Waggon of Life.\\"  The second and third stanza become:<br />We climb aboard the boards at dawn<br />Full of wild devilment and crowing;<br />Spurning the lanquid life with scorn,<br />We cry, `Go on, get *peace with honor* going!'<br />But by midday we've lost that boldness,<br />Feeling the wagon shake and judder.<br />Dread are the heights and dizzy gorges,<br />We cry, `Slow down you silly *peace with honor*!'<br />A few things about this book seemed British to me.  The word which made the least sense to me was \\"judder,\\" in the poem \\"The Waggon of Life,\\" on page 39.  If the word was made up to produce a rhyme, the line it was in would have made more sense if it had ended with the common word, shudder:<br />Feeling the waggon shake and shudder.<br />The stanza doesn't end with:  \\"We cry, `Slow down you silly buggy!\\"fe with scorn,<br />We cry, `Go on, get *peace with honor* going!'<br />But by midday we've lost that boldness,<br />Feeling the wagon shake and judder.<br />Dread are the heights and dizzy gorges,<br />We cry, `Slow down you silly *peace with honor*!'<br />A few things about this book seemed British to me.

After attempting a few summaries of what philosophy is all about, it is great to be able to be able to come back to a book like this and see how so many people got started in this puzzling field. Nietzsche wrote so much, and other philosophers have done everything that they could to be competitive with whatever thoughts they have considered insipid, that this summary is always relevant for those who understand that \\"Whoever thinks much is not suitable as a party member: he soon thinks himself right through the party.\\" (p. 63). Most Americans are sure to think that it should read \\"thinks too much,\\" but they have been easy prey for all those who expect them to be insipidly faithful to the expectation, also expressed by Nietzsche in the form of the commandment, \\"Thou shalt not think.\\"  From a paragraph on page 532 called \\"The Right To Stupidity\\" to the end of this book, Nietzsche increasingly attacks what he considers \\"pure foolishness.\\"<br />Walter Kaufmann, the translater of the selections included in this volume, might prefer to be remembered as a philosopher who questioned guilt more than anything else. Among the selections here:<br />\\"The bite of conscience, like the bite of a dog into a stone, is a stupidity.\\" (p. 68).<br />There is also something on pages 96-7 about the guilt of witches, which we now see as fictitious, and Nietzsche wanted all guilt to be considered equally false.  \\"It is thus with all guilt.\\"  This book does not have an index.  Anyone who is serious about philosophy deserves to have some book which lists items that are considered important alphabetically in the back of the book so that what has been read does not disappear forever, but can be located and reread when it might be useful. Early readers of this book might have thought that Nietzsche's philosophy was mainly THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, with a before and after. Actually, a lot of Nietzsche's works could be studied for major significance in great detail beyond what is included in this book, and Zarathustra might be considered an alter ego which speaks for an individual good spirit that has to laugh to maintain whatever sense it wishes most strongly. A short section of THE GAY SCIENCE called \\"Kant's Joke\\" is included on page 96, just above the section on \\"Guilt,\\" and \\"the secret joke of his soul\\" might be how right he was, or even how right Nietzsche was going to be.  In this book, that is only seven pages before Walter Kaufmann's preface to THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, which calls Nietzsche \\"shy, about five-foot-eight, but a little stooped, almost blind,\\" and \\"an utterly lonely man.\\" (p. 103).

I can only compare this book to great works in the field of philosophy.  Hegel and Schopenhauer started writing before this book was written, and both were famous for being slower than their peers to impress anyone.  Hegel and Stirner wrote anonymous articles in journals before publishing a large major work.  It still isn't clear to some people what Hegel's philosophy was supposed to accomplish, and students took a lot of notes at his lectures, trying to figure it out.  For Max Stirner, THE EGO AND ITS OWN was his only major accomplishment, and it doesn't seem that hard to figure out.<br />The education of Max Stirner, as outlined on pages xxxiii-xxxiv, included philosophy at the University of Berlin, University of Erlangen, University of Konigsberg, completion of formal studies at the University of Berlin, but after taking oral exams, was only awarded a conditional status and spent an unpaid probationary year teaching, \\"followed by a period of private study and irregular work.\\"  He was a teacher \\"at a respectable private girls' school in Berlin\\" from 1839 to 1844, when his book was published.<br />Compared to the brilliant writings of Nietzsche, the contents of this book seem to me more like the fate of philosophy that has fallen into the hands of a Lutheran.  Of a fellow philosopher who sought to liberate our thinking, this book says, \\"But from this it also appears how thoroughly theological is the liberation that Feuerbach is labouring to give us.\\"  (p. 33).  I can relate to that kind of thinking, but Max Stirner doesn't accomplish much for himself until he gets to the second part of the book:  I  Ownness (pp.141-154)  II  The owner (pp. 155-319)  III  The unique one  (pp. 320-324).<br />Isaiah Berlin, in his book KARL MARX, notices how closely Marx and Max Stirner associated with the same people, though Marx thought of them as \\"three sordid peddlers of inferior metaphysical wares\\" (Berlin, p. 105) and wrote of Max Stirner, \\"Under the title of St Max he is pursued through seven hundred pages of heavy-handed mockery and insult.\\"  (Berlin, p. 106).  The idea of a man being master of himself is called a \\"doctrine, which had a great influence on Nietzsche and probably on Bakunin (perhaps because it anticipated Marx's own economic theory of alienation too precisely), is treated as a pathological phenomenon, the agonised cry of a persecuted neurotic, belonging to the province of medicine rather than that of political theory.\\"  (Berlin, p. 106).  At least Berlin isn't talking about religion.<br />Max Stirner is listed in the index of THE SOCIOLOGY OF PHILOSOPHIES by Randall Collins and occupies such an interesting place in Figure 14.2.  Young Hegelians and Religious/Political Radicals, 1835-1900:  DIE FREIEN and the Nihilists (Collins, p. 766) that I expected this book to fill me on on the details about a lot of people.  Martin Luther is mentioned by Max Stirner about six times in the text of THE EGO AND ITS OWN, but the mystery of his importance is not as clear as the confusion leading up to his appearance near the end, with a paragraph before, about \\"There are crazy people who imagine that they are God the Father, God the Son, or the man in the moon, and so too the world swarms with fools who seem to themselves to be sinners; but, as the former are not the man in the moon, so the latter are ~ not sinners.\\"  (Stirner, p. 317).

The author has gathered a lot of details and his interest in Russia is the main context in which the subject is considered.  With the emphasis in this book on how extraordinary the Communist regime of the Soviet Union had been in ruthlessness even before it had the opportunity to acquire atomic weapons, I was afraid that its approach to what I was really interested in would be too tame and toothless for my taste.  More than most nuclear scientists, Andrei Sakharov has been recognized as a great dissident.  Many thought that this was some kind of folly.  \\"In a joke of the time a dog explains glasnost:  `The chain is longer, the food is still far away, but you can bark all you want.'\\"  (p. 373).  Jokes were a major feature of the situation.  There is a paragraph early in the book, about a mannerism of a great Russian poet, who announced his appreciation for the best of his own work with the words, \\"`O Pushkin, you . . . !'  At moments of insight, rubbing his hands in delight, Sakharov would repeat those words aloud.\\"  (p. 48)  The big joke about Pushkin was most appropriate a hundred years after his death, after the official Pushkin Year of 1937, when a few people still had the nerve to say:  \\"If Pushkin had lived in our times, he still would have died in '37.\\"  (p. 46).  Sakharov grew up in tough times, but his sense of reality grew in proportion to the responsibilities which he assumed.  When he was picked on in a personal manner, and he felt that the Soviet system reacted in a way that seemed inappropriate to him personally, he was capable of exhibiting his own toughness.  When Tatiana, Bonner's daughter, was expelled from Moscow University, he was capable of losing the restraint with which people are expected to submit to those who sit in positions of authority.  Poor Ivan Petrovsky, rector of Moscow University. \\"Sakharov lost his temper and pounded the table twice with his fist.  Later that day Petrovsky dropped dead from a heart attack, and in some quarters, including the Academy, Sakharov was considered complicit in Petrovsky's death.\\"  (p. 248).  Joseph Shklovsky, author of FIVE BILLION VODKA BOTTLES TO THE MOON, considered himself a leader \\"because of his mastery of cursing, an art he had learned as a construction foreman.\\"  (p. 59).  Reporting on a month which Sakharov and Shklovsky spent on a train fleeing Moscow as students during World War II, Shklovsky reported, \\"One day he asked me a preposterous favor:  `Do you have anything I can read on physics?' . . . My first impulse was to send this mama's boy and his ridiculous request straight to hell.\\"  (p. 59).  Years later, concerning Petrovsky, Shklovsky said, \\"I can't forgive Andrei Sakharov for the sharp rebuke he delivered to the poor rector.\\"  (p. 248).<br />Since Sakharov was seeking convergence with the rest of the world more than anything else, it made sense for him to go see everyone \\"From Margaret Thatcher to Daniel Ellsberg\\" (p. 360) when he had the chance.  He even \\"had half an hour alone with Edward Teller before a formal banquet honoring Teller on his birthday.\\"  (p. 375)  Later he convinced Solzhenitsyn's wife to call Solzhenitsyn to a phone in Cavendish, Vermont so that \\"there should be nothing left unsaid between us.\\"  (p. 376).  With Elena, he met \\"both the head of the Italian Socialist Party and the pope.  And, in an event that captures the flavor of that year of wonders, Sakharov and the pope discussed perestroika in the Vatican.\\"  (p. 379).<br />He finally met Gorbachev on January 15, 1988, (p. 366) and the two found themselves in an interesting political situation.  After elections on March 26, 1989, Sakharov was to represent the Academy of Sciences in the First Congress of People's Deputies on May 25.  \\"Yeltsin won Sakharov's admiration when he demanded live television coverage of the congress.\\"  (p. 381).  Gorbachev had a committee to draft a new constitution approved \\"when someone noticed all its members were communists.\\"  (p. 384).  Sakharov was added to the committee and became the major opponent of Article 6 of the constitution, which gave the Communist Party a monopoly on power.  Open debate was new to those who had been involved in officially secret proceedings, and Sakharov found himself involved in arguments in which Gorbachev said, \\"I'm against running around like a chicken with its head cut off.\\"  (p. 385).  When the fight turned to Afghanistan, Sakharov had said things which rankled the usual superpower thinking on the Soviet side, and continued to insist, \\"The real issue is that the war in Afghanistan was itself a crime, an illegal adventure, and we don't know who was responsible for it.\\"  (p. 386).  There were shouts in opposition to his views, but polls for the best deputy \\"showed Sakharov number one, Yeltsin two, and Gorbachev seventeenth.\\"  (p. 386).

I find the book difficult to read, but people whose minds have absorbed the awesome responsibility assumed by the United States at the end of World War II for maintaining a peace which surpasses the decency of any former age ought to see if they can relate to the author's position on this work as a classic example of how historical ethics can subsequently be applied to anything which tended to favor the worst kinds of behavior.<br />There is something in this book, and in Isaiah, about an ox and something too absurd to relate in a review as an actual sermon that has been preserved for hundreds of years. ...The problem with reading this book (for those who would consider such an activity to be anything other than a distraction from the daily activities of our mundane world) is the problem that anyone who seeks a foundation for an honest society might still express: among whom would an honest society be more likely, or even possible?	2002-07-05

Having to practice the piano as a kid seems to me such a great start for the life of an intellectual, that even the beginning of this book made sense to me.  I can relate to most of the character features of this book in an intellectual way, also.  It is reported on page 573 that &quot;Ellsberg was invited by undergraduates to teach a student-sponsored course on `nuclear weapons and foreign policy'at Stanford in 1979.&quot;  As a lesson in reality, student interest dwindled rapidly when students discovered &quot;that Ellsberg `relied too much on his memory of what he personally was involved in. . . . It may not have been well organized.&quot;  More in line with the way everybody is thinking about these things, Harvard Medical School arranged for Ellsberg to teach a course under a center John Mack &quot;had set up called the Center for Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age.&quot;  (p. 573).  This approaches the field of philosophy in allowing the students to think that they are directly engaging in a study of the thoughts of their professor.<br />I have owned WILD MAN / THE LIFE AND TIMES OF DANIEL ELLSBERG for a year, and appreciated the information about his Harvard years the most.  He certainly had more fun at Harvard than I ever had.  Photograph number 5, showing &quot;Daniel and Carol Ellsberg holding the purloined ibis at Harvard&quot; shows how readily the students who wrote the &quot;Crimson&quot; could make the news in their paper whatever they wanted it to be, including his line, &quot;It is absurd to maintain that a copper bird could have arranged a series of audiences with notables, or eluded pursuers unaided.&quot;  (p. 89).  Ultimately, news in this country became about what the students at Harvard thought it was.  I'm afraid the failure which WILD MAN frequently expresses about the life of Daniel Ellsberg relate to the character of our political system as much as to anything that Daniel Ellsberg might have done.<br />For a few months, I have been reading SAKHAROV / A BIOGRAPHY by Richard Lourie, and I noticed that Daniel Ellsberg was mentioned on page 360 of that book, as someone that Sakharov saw after seven years in which he had seen no one.  Sakharov is not mentioned in WILD MAN, not even in the list of people who Tom Wells would give more credit to than Daniel Ellsberg for accomplishing something in the control of nuclear weapons.  Politically, it was always felt that Daniel Ellsberg's contributions were &quot;not going to be any kind of dynamite,&quot; (p. 351), but Ellsberg himself seemed &quot;nervous and worried. . . . He spoke fast and made jerky movements.  He seemed to be a harried man.&quot;  (p. 351).  Sakharov had the advantage of dealing with a political system which could see the need for a change, when he could deal with a leader, Gorbachev, who sincerely needed to find ways to change things for the better.  Daniel Ellsberg is already in a system in which change is such a constant that almost anyone in the system could be the anonymous source who told Tom Wells, &quot;I mean, he doesn't even begin to pretend to be interested in me anymore.&quot;  (p. 604).ading SAKHAROV / A BIOGRAPHY by Richard Lourie, and I noticed that Daniel Ellsberg was mentioned on page 360 of that book, as someone that Sakharov saw after seven years in which he had seen no one.

It usually isn't obvious to such groups how much the rest of the world might disagree.  This short work on ancient Greek drama by a French educator attempts to examine a few other angles, and it manages to produce a broader perspective on such things by examining elements of ancient art which resonate about like \\"Oedipus has forced open the door that Jocasta had carefully closed on herself, and now everyone can see the woman hanging, `caught in the noose that swings'.\\"  (p. 17).  The details of the book are about the poetic aspects of characters like Evadne in \\"Suppliant Women\\" by Euripides, who ends it all with the cry, \\"Here I am on this rock, like a bird, above the pyre of Capaneus, I rise lightly, upward on a deadly swing.\\"  (p. 18).  The end of this book is actually a cast of characters, listed alphabetically, so the final place of honor goes to Theseus, on whom it reports, \\"King of Athens, husband of Phaedra, and father of Hippolytus, whom he wrongly cursed.  See Euripides, `Hippolytus'.\\"  (p. 95).	2002-06-26

If I had a lot more time, I might search the text and all of its charts for the name of David Friedrich Strauss, author of the German study, THE LIFE OF JESUS CRITICALLY EXAMINED translated into English by George Eliot in 1845.  There is no listing in the index of this book for Strauss, but the name D. F. Strauss appears in the text in a paragraph on page 621 which also mentions Darwin, and on some charts, such as Figure 13.1 GERMAN NETWORK, 1835-1900:  NEO-KANTIANS, HISTORICISTS, POSITIVISTS, PSYCHOLOGISTS on page 690, where it even appears in a rectangle like the names Hegel, Schelling, Hegel again, and Schleiermacher near the top of the chart.  The rectangles might indicate a level of fame that assumed that certain of their books had been read, though George Eliot once wrote, &quot;but I do not know one person who is likely to read the book through, do you?&quot;  Similarly, by size, this book might be considered the most professionally encompassing but intellectually democratic attempt to offer a theory (the law of small numbers) that approaches philosophical thought in the manner which socialized religion has used to convert religious belief to something which it can find useful.<br />While some outstanding experts on humor, like Freud and Heine, are mentioned in this book, the index does not provide lists for jokes.  I tried looking up the key terms in the line, &quot;Science is a sacred cow.&quot;  The number of entries on Schools, Science, and Secularization only list a few pages, from 609 to 613, on anti-scientific intellectuals.  There are no entries for Cow, but it would be between the listings for Courts and courtiers and for Creativity, which includes a bit (see pages 44-46, 52) on a discussion of emotional energy.  Comedy would be found between the listings for &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot; and Conflict as source of intellectual change.

The classic story by Washington Irving which establishes the theme of this bargain book of stories might also serve as a reminder of how out of touch anyone who preserves a sense of how the past has shaped this world can be in a social situation which needs to concentrate totally on an appreciation of what is happening now.  Among the selections in this book is \\"English and French Character,\\" in which Irving observed how an Englishman \\"makes a little solitude around him by his silence and reserve; he moves about shy and solitary, and, as it were, buttoned up, body and soul.\\"  (p. 184).  There are also observations, in \\"The Art of Bookmaking,\\" of authors at work \\"in the reading room of the great British Library~an immense collection of volumes of all ages and languages, many of which are now forgotten, and most of which are seldom read; one of these sequestered pools of obsolete literature in which modern authors repair and draw buckets full of classic lore, or `pure English, undefiled,' wherewith to swell their own scanty rills of thought.\\"  (p. 99).  Somehow the occasion gave Washington Irving a fantasy, which he related quite vividly, of old authors from the portraits which hung on the walls of this famous reading room attacking an expert on Greek thought, and \\"There was something so ludicrous in the catastrophe of this learned Theban that I burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, which broke the whole illusion.\\"  (p. 103).<br />My relationship (what I might steal most easily, if I were an author) with Rip Van Winkle might be more like the part of old Peter Vanderdonk, a character in that story who \\"assured the company that it was a fact, handed down from his ancestor the historian, that the Kaatskill Mountauns had always been haunted by strange beings.  That it was affirmed that the great Hendrick Hudson, the first discoverer of the river and country, kept a vigil there every twenty years, with his crew of the Half Moon, being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of his enterprise and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the great city called by his name.  That his father had once seen them in their old Dutch dresses playing at ninepins in a hollow of the mountain, and that he himself had heard, one summer afternoon, the sound of their balls, like distant peals of thunder.\\"  (p. 17).  When I hear thunder, though, I am reminded of how much it sounds like a distant echo of bombing in the mountains where I heard my first B-52 bombing strike, near An Lao northwest of Bong Son in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam almost 33 years ago.  Other people might have different associations for thunder, but the link to Rip Van Winkle remains uncanny.he scenes of his enterprise and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the great city called by his name.

Page 397 ends with an entry on Ticket Punching, so Ticket Punching is the caption at the top of the page.  Of the nine entries on that page, I was most familiar with 365 Days, a book by Ronald J. Glasser, a U.S. Army Medical Corps physician who treated burn patients in Japan.  There is also an entry for Strom Thurmond, a U.S. Senator since 1954, on that page.  All that page 397 says about Thot Not, Operation is \\"See Daniel Boone Operations.\\"  Daniel Boone was a Special Forces thing in Cambodia.  Ultimately Thot Not was arrived at as the perfect description for such people who, being \\"dressed as peasants or in unrecognizable uniforms, went into Cambodia to gather intelligence or to sabotage communist installations at the Southern end of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, despite U.S. law forbidding operations in countries not at war with the United States.\\"  (p. 88).  The entry for Operation Arc Light covers almost a page, from the first strike on 18 June 1965, dropped from B-52s flying above 30,000 feet, to the last on 18 August 1973.  I had missed seeing the effective strikes against NVA forces at Khe Sanh in 1968 and Pleiku and An Loc in 1972 when they happened, and only visited one of those sites in the highly exciting time in between those events.  There are only eleven lines in the entry for Fonda, Jane, not counting the \\"See also:  Hawks and Doves; Teach-Ins.\\"  (p. 131).  The entry on Free-Fire Zones is longer, and includes the information that \\"After 1965, the Pentagon renamed the zones `specific strike zones,'\\" (p. 138), but I was in one after 1969 and still think that the army was calling them Free-Fire Zones.  I was too close to Pinkville to know what the Pentagon was thinking about a lot of things, so this book contains a number of revelations, even for me.  Also from Washington, D.C., Appendix E has the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Public Law 88-408; 78 Stat. 384 which clearly stated, \\"the United States is assisting the peoples of southeast Asia to protect their freedom and has no territorial, military or political ambitions in that area.\\"  (p. 543)  Appendix F on pages 545-578 contains the text of the Paris Peace Accords~27 January 1973, and I might read this some day to see if it says anything about American bodies, a subject on which there is no entry in the main part of the Dictionary, but which has been the subject of much diplomatic discussion since the Accords were agreed to, and articles in the press always seemed a bit vague about what the elements of the agreement were.

The subtle things in this book are suspected of being capable of doing serious damage to the idea of consensus.  Still, this is mainly a book for serious readers who seek ideas in previous centuries.  It is unlikely to provide much material to songwriters and comedians who long for sustained fame in the 21st century, and who might benefit by providing the kind of depth contained in the title of Chapter XIII, \\"It is Shown That Scripture Teaches Only Very Simple Doctrines, Such as Suffice for Right Conduct.\\"  (p. 175).  This unabridged Elwes translation, available from Dover Publications since 1951, was originally published in 1883.  According to the Introduction, the second work included here on pages 279 to 387 (where this unfinished work reaches a lack of conclusiveness with, \\"we shall easily see that men and women cannot rule alike without great hurt to peace.  But of this enough.\\") A POLITICAL TREATISE was translated by A. H. Gosset, \\"who has also, in my absence from England, kindly seen the work through the press.\\"  (pp. xxxii - xxxiii).  The lofty thoughts presented in the main work here are primarily theological in nature.  There is no index, and the Notes on pages 267-278 are those of the author on the primary work, A THEOLOGICO-POLITICAL TREATISE.  Chapter I, \\"Of Prophecy,\\" on \\"sure knowledge revealed by God to man,\\" (p. 13) as distinct from ordinary knowledge which all share, and Moses is considered first, as unique in the sense expressed by Deut. xxiv. 10:  \\"And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses whom the Lord knew face to face.\\"  (p. 18).  Furthermore, Spinoza wrote, \\"that if Moses spoke with God face to face as a man speaks with his friend (i.e. by means of their two bodies) Christ communed with God mind to mind.\\"  (p. 19).  There is a return to the earlier view of Moses on pages 123-4 in Chapter VIII on \\"The Authorship of the Pentateuch.\\"  After an examination of the early books of the Bible, and especially Deuteronomy, it was the opinion of Spinoza, \\"I cannot find anyone, save Ezra, to whom to attribute the sacred books.\\"  (p. 130).<br />The Introduction by R. H. M. Elwes provides a few facts about Spinoza's life on pages x-xx and a brief summary of his writings, primarily the Ethics from pages xxiii to xxxi.  The description of appetite, desire, pleasure, and pain on page xxvii as a basis from which \\"Spinoza deduces the entire list of human emotions\\" is thought to be the best of Spinoza, but that isn't what this book is about.  As the Ethics developed, \\"The doctrine that rational emotion, rather than pure reason, is necessary for subduing evil passions, is entirely his own.\\"  (p. xxviii).  Tobacco is not mentioned often in this book, but it is reported that one of Spinoza's amusements was \\"smoking now and again a pipe of tobacco.\\"  (p. xix).  Also on Saturday, February 20, 1677, Spinoza spent some time with the landlord and his wife \\"in conversation, and smoked a pipe of tobacco, but went to bed early.\\"  (p. xx).  His friend and physician, Lewis Meyer, came to see him the next day, the 21st, and Spinoza expired at about three o'clock on that Sunday afternoon, while the landlord and his wife were at church.  The malady from which Spinoza suffered was called phthisis, and it seems as unlikely that any pain that he might have suffered will be conclusively linked to the habit which he enjoyed by doctors who currently do research on heart and lung problems for the leading companies in the tobacco industry, but there may be some basis here for finding a link between philosophy and what they call \\"junk science.\\"<br />Those who seek commentaries might find a number to choose from.  Spinoza's works were targets of opportunity for philosophers who were concerned about freedom of religion.  The final mention of Spinoza in the text of THE SOCIOLOGY OF PHILOSOPHIES by Randall Collins (Harvard University Press, 1998, paperback, 2000) is in a section called Deep Troubles:  Free Will and Determinism, Substance and Plurality.  As simply summarized there, \\"Spinoza avoided two-substance dilemmas by positing a single substance with mental and material aspects\\" (p. 843).  The conclusion of that section of Collins's Chapter 15, \\"Sequence and Branch in the Social Production of Ideas\\" is \\"No doubt future philosophies will be created upon this long-standing deep trouble.\\"  (p. 845).  That seems far more likely than that anyone will explain why Spinoza died of phthisis.tance and Plurality.

Dreaming of Babylon might be the ultimate description, in a detective story, of the results of American intelligence when applied to the question of left and right (whichever one happened to be pointing straight up in the air went click instead of boom).  The Hawkline Monster has a college professor working in ice caves until he was turned into an elephant foot umbrella stand.  This must be about cold war intellectuals, and it might even be safe to say that, now that the cold war is over, but the intellectuals are still here.  Trust me, I am not giving too much away about these books.  There are so many jokes packed into these novels that offering a rubric for understanding how anyone could write this stuff and still feed chickens in Montana with his household garbage, the corn cobs of which seemed like skylab to him when one landed on a chicken's head, should not be read as an attempt to impose any limitation that would keep people who know how this stuff goes from thinking that my opinions about this stuff could easily seem as clueless as the thoughts of the detective in Dreaming of Babylon after a major league baseball pitcher practiced throwing fast balls at his head.	2002-05-22

The Apology which Montaigne wrote for the work of Raymond Sebond arose from his understanding of a book, Theologia Naturalis, written in an obscure form of Spanish, which Montaigne's father (\\"in the `last days' of his life\\") requested that Montaigne translate into French for the benefit of those who were engaged in the struggles of the Reformation, \\"a period of intellectual ferment and of religious and political disarray.\\"  (p. ix).  Montaigne finished and dedicated his translation on the day of his father's death, 18 June 1568, when Montaigne was 35, married, and engaged in a legal position.  The Apology does not identify which of its ideas were original with Sebond.  There is no index, so I am unsure of how often the name Sebond appears in the text  The Introduction on pages ix to xxxiii explains the circumstances and theology of the book philosophically, as understood at All Souls College, Oxford, on Easter 1986.  The dedication and \\"Montaigne's translation and adaptation of the Prologus of Raymond Sebond\\" appear on pages xl to xliv.  Those who have a complete edition of the ESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE should be able to find the material in this book at II:12, though this book is clear in which portions appeared in 1580, 1582, 1588, or from the \\"text of the manuscript edition being prepared by Montaigne when he died, interpreted in the light of the posthumous editions.\\"  (p. xxxv).<br />On the doom or dumber question, we can find, \\"Philosophy in general agrees that there is an ultimate remedy to be prescribed for every kind of trouble: namely, ending our life if we find it intolerable.\\"  (p. 62).  This is associated with, \\"As the Greeks said at their banquets: `Let him drink or be off! (Aut bibat, aut abeat!')~That is particularly apt if your pronounce Cicero's language like a Gascon, changing your `B's to `V's:  Aut vivat ~ Let him live . . .\\"  (p. 62).  The long latin poems are provided with English translations in brackets, so it is possible to understand that a poem by Cicero ends with him worrying \\"lest you start to drink too much and find that pretty girls laugh at you and push you away.\\"  (pp. 62-3).  This might be typical of philosophy, but Montaigne is capable of grasping more difficult situations.  On learning, this work declares, \\"even our system of Law, they say, bases the truth of its justice upon legal fictions.  Learning pays us in the coin of suppositions which she confesses she has invented herself.\\"  (p. 111).  Civilization might be based on a belief that law is a better solution than suicide for every kind of trouble, but a lot of news is about people who have opted for some form of suicide or something worse.

I bought PERSECUTION AND THE ART OF WRITING because I wanted an easy approach to whatever contribution Leo Strauss might be able to make to the understanding of political philosophy, and the idea that writers might be persecuted is fundamental to my understanding of what separates social thinking from what a philosopher might be capable of.  The second chapter, which covers the topic &quot;Persecution and the art of writing,&quot; is only from page 22 to page37 of this book.  The Introduction attempts to provide a basis for understanding all the essays in this book &quot;within the province of the sociology of knowledge.&quot; (p. 7).  The final chapter, &quot;How to Study Spinoza's THEOLOGICO-POLITICAL TREATISE,&quot; is the culmination of a series of articles, which first appeared in 1941, 1943, and 1948, that is primarily concerned with understanding the works of a few philosophers in a manner which might be helpful &quot;for a future sociology of philosophy.&quot; (p. 7).<br />The particular work of Spinoza discussed was an attempt &quot;to refute the claims which had been raised on behalf of revelation throughout the ages.&quot;  (p. 142).  Studying the Treatise is primarily philosophical because &quot;the issue raised by the conflicting claims of philosophy and revelation is discussed in our time on a decidedly lower level than was almost customary in former ages.&quot;  (pp. 142-3).  Later it is admitted that Spinoza's own age did not have Spinoza's books to discuss.  &quot;The only book which he published under his own name is devoted to the philosophy of Descartes.&quot;  (p. 152).  &quot;But Spinoza, who wrote for posterity rather than for his contemporaries, must have realized that the day would come when his own books would be old books.&quot;  (p. 153).  My own understanding of Spinoza is not helped by the fact that the longest quotations, in note 2 on page 143 and note 19 on page 153, are in latin.  Note 13 on page 149 quotes Carl Gebhardt (Spinoza. OPERA, vol. II, p. 317) in German.  I thought I was going to be able to understand it best when Strauss wrote, &quot;To ascertain how to read Spinoza, we shall do well to cast a glance at his rules for reading the Bible.&quot;  (p. 144).

In the case of the Bible, the idea of revelation offers the consolation to people who never wanted to be considered its authors that the book was written by someone else, as the angel who dictated the Koran to its prophet is the ultimate target of the book THE SATANIC VERSES by Salman Rushdie in the most modern comic edition of this conflict.

This book, published in 1958, realistically expected to provide its readers with an education in philosophy of religion which would allow society to function on an intellectual level which has not been approached at any time since then. As an example of the kind of excitement which was considered possible in those heady times, the following paragraph might even be considered politically relevant to the problems which still face leading thinkers today:<br />One can hardly recommend Coulton's work too highly as a supplement to the works of Gilson, Maritain, and Copleston; and to those who prefer to read a Catholic's report on some outstanding saints, one may commend Malcolm Hay's enormously exciting book, THE FOOT OF PRIDE: THE PRESSURE OF CHRISTENDOM ON THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FOR 1900 YEARS. What is questionable about the sentences quoted from Coulton is merely the manner in which he exempts the New Testament from his strictures. (pp. 214-5).<br />After 44 years of people doing their own things, it seems more likely that \\"Foot of Pride\\" only rings a bell as the name of an obscure song by Bob Dylan, released on CD in a Bootleg Series (Volumes I-III), and sung by Lou Reed on a 30th anniversary Bobfest TV special (\\"When the foot of pride comes down, there ain't no turning back\\" sounds especially convincing when it is coming from Lou Reed, wrapped in rock 'n' roll) than that people in the 21st century will ever be asked if they have read a book by Malcolm Hay.  The Bibliography (p. 438 of CRITIQUE OF RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY) reveals that its title was changed to EUROPE AND THE JEWS when it was released by Beacon paperback in 1960 with a new preface by Walter Kaufmann.  I might have found that book exciting, if I had been able to find that book, but I only looked in the obvious places, and of all the books I ordered last week, it will be the last to be shipped. This kind of problem is sure to happen to people who use the writings of scholars of the last century as a guide to how people think.  With events becoming so much more important than mankind, it isn't clear if that topic (what were we thinking?) is ever likely to be considered again.<br />What we have now, in addition to a lot of other choices, is a channel which offers cable TV subscribers comedy 24 hours a day. There is a section in this book on philosophers who can't laugh, \\"perhaps related to the prohibition of laughter in church.\\" (p. 13). In our own times of a thoroughly comic society, it seems that Nietzsche's \\"lighthearted derision of the spirit of gravity, and his exhortation to laugh\\" (p. 13) have become a therapeutic norm which was approached by Walter Kaufmann at the conclusion of his section on laughter. \\"Hegel had seen enough to laugh but felt ashamed to and hid his humor.

I don't know enough German to read this book as it was intended to be read.  I had a German dictionary the first time I tried to plow through it, and I was keeping my attempts to translate anything by Heine which was quoted in the original German.  When I was really stumped, I could look back on my previous efforts and see that I couldn't be sure about much, as the German dictionary always offered more interpretations than Heine could possibly have meant to say, and I could only pare things down to the context in which I was finding them in this book.  There are still parts of this book that I find enlightening, and the idea that I am only getting a gloss which lacks the insight that quotations of Heine were supposed to add to the text makes my attempt to understand this as forlorn as the feelings which I often associate with reading Heine's poems by themselves.  The relationship of meaning to explanation is most obvious when Sammons adopts a critical distance from Heine, as in the Introduction:  The Elusive Birthdate, The Poet as Executioner:  DIE BADER VON LUCCA, Poet Versus Tribune:  BORNE, Appendix 1 on The Communist Image, and Appendix 2 on The Jewish Image:  Max Brod.<br />My favorite line in the middle of this book, on the first page of Chapter 6, is about an incident which is considered notorious.  \\"For not only did Heine engage in a battle of wits with an unarmed man, but he made use of other weapons in a way that was, to say the least, far from sportsmanlike.\\"  (p. 150).  This is about a polemic which \\"was the ultimate result of a series of stupidities,\\" (p. 150) and I found a translation of Heine's book in which \\"the satirical ruthlessness of which he was capable\\" (p. 152) was perfectly clear to me, and I could understand how someone in Freud's position might appreciate this kind of humor.  I even like it, myself.	2002-05-07

My favorite part of the book is the fourth major topic, \\"Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious.\\"  The jokes might seem a bit stale.  My printing of this book is copyright 1938, and comparison of its index with the online version of pages shown indicates that the newer version is not quite the same number of pages, but the book itself is the same as the original.  For people who have trouble remembering psychological concepts or intellectual approaches to anything, but who never forget a joke, Freud's ability to keep referring to the same joke in different contexts offers an ideal opportunity to see how an expert in a field can intertwine basic concepts with known ideas to create the sensation of intellectual progress.  Speaking of experts, the index has 16 entries for Heine, the first of which is merely a footnote on how dreams might work like Heine, who was famous for making the bad poetry of the King of Bavaria (Herr Ludwig?) ridiculous, in THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS.  The poem is only in German in the edition I have, so the comment, \\"He does it by using even worse rhymes,\\" might only be funny for people who know what German sounds like.  The final mention of Heine, which might be to a joke that Freud had not told before, is to a verse in which he complained, \\"until at last the buttons tore from the pants of my patience,\\" in Freud's discussion of the various forms of the comic.  You might not appreciate how big this book is until you have read it.	2002-05-07

This is a book which seeks a place for humanity in the poetic extremes of intellectual life.  Near the end, \\"Dionysus in 1990,\\" Georges Bataille, author of THE ACCURSED SHARE, gets credit for writing, \\"Religion is the satisfaction that a society gives to the use of its excess resources, or rather to their destruction.\\"  (p. 188).  With the thoroughly modern economic ploy of monetary expansion in the late 20th century, the progress of humanity was based largely on the willingness of everyone to engage in deep play, in which \\"The game that is played with the surplus is gambling, with a built-in risk of self-destruction, a built-in need for competition, and a built-in demand for new goods to replenish the store and be in turn destroyed (as in `planned obsolescence').  A need for hemorrhage is built into the system.\\"  (p. 187).  This is a culmination of the intellectual approach in these essays, from the years 1960-1990, and, as the Preface puts it, looking back is \\"partly retrospective, at the end of an era.\\"  (p. ix).<br />APOCALYPSE AND/OR METAMORPHOSIS begins with an outstanding Phi Beta Kappa Speech delivered at Columbia University on May 31, 1960.  Already on page 2, this book declares, \\"Resisting madness can be the maddest way of being mad.\\"  Religion is considered \\"the learned ignorance, in which God is better honored and loved by silence than by words, and better seen by closing the eyes to images than by opening them.\\"  (p. 3).  The second selection in this book is aphoristic.  \\"Daphne, or Metamorphosis.\\"  It seems to be about poetry.  \\"Petrarch says that he invented the beautiful name of Laura, but that in reality Laura was nothing but that poetic laurel which he had pursued with incessant labor.\\"  (p. 10).  Similarly, the next section considers Sir John Falstaff in Shakespeare.  \\"The horn, the horn, the lusty horn, Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.\\"  (p. 37).<br />The fifth section of the book, \\"The Prophetic Tradition,\\" is an attempt at \\"Ecumenical prophetic history,\\" (p. 47), which is contrasted with \\"Hegelian triumphalism.\\"  (p. 47).  Islam is seen as part of the prophetic tradition.  \\"Protestants should be able to see that the need for a Protestant Reformation was there already in the seventh century C.E., to be perceived by prophetic eyes.  Blakeans should be able to see that there is no way to accept `Again He speaks' in Blake unless we accept that again He speaks in the Koran.\\"  (p. 48).  The anti-philosophical attempt by Justinian to purify Christian doctrine by closing the schools of philosophy in the year 529, and Christian opposition to the Gnostic Judaeo-Christian heresy \\"which struggled to avoid the catastrophic rupture between Christianity and Judaism\\" (p. 49) is the background for Norman O. Brown's philosophical attempt to conclude, \\"Islam is to be envisaged as dialectical evolution, or evolutionary mutation, in the prophetic tradition, in response to the limitations built into the structure of orthodox Christianity by its compromise with Roman imperialism; by its commitment to scriptural canon, creedal orthodoxy, and episcopal hierarchy; and by its consequent scandalous history of schism and persecution (duly noted in the Koran).\\"  (p. 50).

Stone seemed to take it personally whenever any part of the globe was under consideration for being sent back to a new Stone Age by modern weaponry.  Regarding proposals for more relentless pursuit of American policy in Vietnam on January 20, 1966, he wrote, \\"But this tough old troglodyte is not through yet.  The whole air force drive in Vietnam is to transform a war we can't win to a war we might; from a war for the loyalties of the Vietnamese people into a war to destroy them; this is giving the obsolete B-52 its last murderous gasp over South Vietnam's jungles and rice paddies.\\"  (p. 104)  That was a long time ago, and Stone can hardly be blamed for failing to see that the situations which could make such activities popular would fail to end in his own time.  He had some grasp of history, but hardly could tell that we were all heading for catastrophes in which being unable to relate would be the new norm.<br />Torment is the key word in the title.  The 1960s were years which were my golden age for understanding the geopolitical situation, because I was young enough  to appreciate political views without regard for who was making money or controlling the means of production.  I. F. Stone was astute enough to make his own economic criticism count in such times, even in the unlikely context of a review of the life of General Curtis LeMay, \\"after a lifetime of bomber command, as he told it to the writer of his story, MacKinley Kantor.\\"  (p. 92):<br />His nearest approach to an unfriendly remark about the capitalist system is an angry comment in his account of how the Air Corps flew the mails in 1934 under Roosevelt.  \\"The public bought the idea (and still retains it),\\" he comments sourly, \\"that scores of Air Corps pilots lost their lives in an heroic but absurd attempt to emulate the superb performance of the commercial airlines.\\"  It is only in the bitterness of his feud with McNamara, that he allows himself to reflect by implication on the Business Man. . . .(p. 93).<br />Much as such disputes might have mattered in the Department of Defense, I. F. Stone was independent enough, in his own paper, to have his own approach:  \\"The military-industrial complex never had an officer more loyally blinkered.\\"  (p. 94).  These were merely preliminary matters to be gotten out of the way before discussing the forms of torment which were to be most closely associated with General Curtis LeMay in the tasks which he had willingly attempted to accomplish.  The point at which I feel that I learned the most from I. F. Stone was in finding an intellectual foundation for this kind of torment in \\"the doctrine of the Prussian military writers of the nineteenth century.\\"  (pp. 96-7).  It was an approach adopted by Hindenburg in Poland, early in World War I, on November 20, 1914, when he wrote, \\"Lotz is starving.  That is deplorable, but it ought to be so.  The more pitiless the conduct of the war the more humane it is in reality, for it will run its course all the sooner.\\"  (p. 97).  The statement was only a little more than fifty years old when Stone quoted it.

I have an old hardcover copy of this book, copyright 1904, reprinted in 1936, when times had been hard and weren't getting much better.  The Preface had proclaimed a unique point of view:  \\"the aims, motives, and means that condition current business traffic.  This choice of a point of view is itself given by the current economic situation, in that the situation plainly is primarily a business situation.\\"  (p. v).  Later on, considering the nature of technological society, Veblen adopts a view of thinking that is very much like the thoughts of Karl Marx on people who try to survive by having a job in such a system.  \\"His place is to take thought of the machine and its work in terms given him by the process that is going forward.  His thinking in the premises is reduced to standard units of gauge and grade.  If he fails of the precise measure, by more or less, the exigencies of the process check the aberration and drive home the absolute need of conformity.\\"  (p. 308).  This is not particularly appealing to anyone who has had the misfortune to see the results of such thinking in military pacification procedures, strategic bombing campaigns, politics, philosophy, psychology, religion, and the practice of law as a professional occupation.  People who cannot see a connection here never read anything like this book.<br />Veblen has a footnote in the chapter \\"Civilization and the Machine Process\\" on the workman's intellectual life, which is weakened by being prone to being twisted by those striving for purpose and benevolence that seems to apply to cyberpower capabilities allocating capital in our global financial system \\"after the manner of current nursery tales and pulpit oratory, he is sure to go wrong.\\"	2002-04-23

The Preface of this book notes the distinction between the items in this book, \\"lectures intended for a so-called `general audience' (that is, students and teachers in colleges and universities, as opposed to gatherings of specialists in philosophy); second, occasional contributions to newspapers and magazines,\\" (p. xii) and the three volumes of PHILOSOPHICAL PAPERS which were published previously.  This collection is for the wider audience, and it demonstrates an understanding of how society functions in the absence of what has usually been considered philosophy.  It shows an awareness of philosophy, but with a realistic appraisal of how little it might control our thoughts.  \\"This means, for example, that we cannot employ the Kantian distinction between morality and prudence.\\"  (p. xvi).<br />The philosophical case for the existence of irony is acute in this book's consideration of the alternatives possible in the life of Heidegger.  As it is and was, \\"For those of us who wish to pick over the tools in Heidegger's box, the fact that the man who designed these remarkable tools was first a Nazi and later a cowardly hypocrite is just one of history's many ironies.\\"  (p. 192).  In the world as Rorty would prefer it, Heidegger's books could have been slightly different, and he imagines \\"the INTRODUCTION TO METAPHYSICS contains a contemptuous identification of the National Socialist movement with the mindless nihilism of modern technology, as well as the remark that Hitler is dragging Germany down to the metaphysical level of Russia and America.\\"  (p. 195)  Heidegger's philosophy would still boil down to \\"This struggle, this private pursuit of purity, was the core of his life.  It was incapable of being greatly influenced either by his love for particular persons or by the political events of his time.\\"  (p. 195).  Ultimately, the privacy which the real Heidegger sunk into is condemned by Rorty as denial of the torment which he chose to ignore.  \\"In our actual world, he turned his face away, and eventually resorted to hysterical denial.  This silence brought on his unforgivable silence.\\"  (p. 196).  What really hurts this book is the realization that reality could be so bad that eventually any country's greatest philosopher might end up getting his share of the blame.turned his face away, and eventually resorted to hysterical denial.

Mostly this is a book of portraits, and the sculptures which are in this book are usually called &quot;Head&quot;.  The best of the sculptures, in The Tate Gallery in London, looks pretty tall for a head.  Even the painted faces might seem a bit long, but I think the main tendency has been for Modigliani to paint noses which were longer than the noses on the people I see.  Some of the faces have a nose which is defined by a distinctive curve on just one side of the nose, but the only profile view which I remember in this book is the 1909 Charcoal of Paul Alexander on page 25.  Sometimes the color of the nose makes the tip of the nose seem like the only realistic part of the picture, as in the oil on canvas painting of Chaim Soutine in 1916 on page 43.  The paintings on pages 44 and 45 provide a nice contrast between his use of lines on both sides of a long, straight nose (the guy) on the left and a single curve in Portrait of a Girl, 1916, on the right.  There are four women with distinctly different noses on pages 82, 83, 84, and 85.  I might not have noticed this so much, except that when I was most interested in art, someone told me that all my pictures looked the same, and I realized that the best one that I had ever done (it looked more like a close-up) was an ear.	2002-04-07

I never really had to draw artistically, but I spent years drafting mechanical objects, carefully placing straight lines in proportionally accurate positions.  Having a book like this is much less embarrassing than signing up for a drawing class and having personal responsibility for drawings which don't look good, for whatever reason.  The ability to draw is a major basis for art, as far as I am concerned, and a lot of the mechanics are obvious once a technique is successfully demonstrated.  Anything you see in this book can be believed, and possibly even understood, artistically.  This book also provides a short history in art, mainly about one person in Paris from 1906 to 1913, who had a friend who told him \\"Don't throw anything away.\\" (Page 9 explains how \\"Paul Alexandre begged his friend not to destroy a single sketchbook, a single study.\\")  There are, in addition to hundreds of drawings, some oil paintings reproduced in this book.  On page 88 is one which was bought by the author's father because the person who commissioned The Amazon, 1909, rejected it (she might have thought that the eyes were too large; \\"The Baroness did not like her portrait very much and recognized herself in it still less when Modigliani decided at the last moment that he had to repaint her red jacket in yellow.\\"  p. 89), so it was purchased by Paul Alexandre.<br />First, I am impressed that black and white photographs from that era can be reproduced so large and well.  The people (see pages 14, 18, 20, 33, 45, 49, 51, 72, 79, 107) and places in Paris (pages 22, 36, 68, 70, 71, 81), postcards from Livorno, Modigliani's native town (pp. 108-9) and even a book by Nietzsche, Ainsi parlait Zarathoustra on page 63, fill these pages nicely.  The manuscript notes reproduced on some pages are usually in French.  Part of one is translated as \\"Equilibrium by means of opposite extremes.\\"  (p. 92).  Earlier it was mentioned that Modigliani was not the type of person who kept track of things in a journal, so \\"these brief lines are particularly precious to us, even if, in the absence of any other documentation, we are unable to understand their full meaning.\\"  (pp. 92-93).<br />Secondly, there are explanations of the elements of Modigliani's sculptures and pictures.  One feature which he drew a number of times, caryatids, are defined at the beginning of a section discussing those drawings.  \\"Another setting which is theatrical in character is created by the architectural use of caryatids in place of pilasters or columns to support the entablature of a building.\\"  (p. 189)  There are foldout pages of the drawings which follow, so that, after seeing the figures on page 193, and turning to page 194, the next page which is visible is page 199, which lists the contents of pages 195-198, which are hidden until 194 and 199 are folded out to reveal the four pictures inside side by side.  This might be set up this way because plate 108 shows a Hermaphrodite caryatid, frontal view, which was supposed to be hidden from anyone who didn't know where to look for it.  The other ones might have been hidden because they were smiling, or too luscious, and placed there as a special reward for those who happened to be reading the book slowly enough to discover them.<br />Thirdly, the next section, Sculptural heads, starting on page 237, doesn't have much to say, but the comparison of the drawings of Head in left profile runs from pages 255 to 263, without numbers on some pages.  Plate 194, Head in left profile with earring; Blue crayon heightened with red gouache, is large and colorful.  In the later sections of the book, there is a study with blue ink on page 368, and my favorite color in the book is the blue ink on pages 389, 390, and 392.

One feature which he drew a number of times, caryatids, are defined at the beginning of a section discussing those drawings.  \\"Another setting which is theatrical in character is created by the architectural use of caryatids in place of pilasters or columns to support the entablature of a building.\\"  (p. 189)  There are foldout pages of the drawings which follow, so that, after seeing the figures on page 193, and turning to page 194, the next page which is visible is page 199, which lists the contents of pages 195-198, which are hidden until 194 and 199 are folded out to reveal the four pictures inside side by side.  This might be set up this way because plate 108 shows a Hermaphrodite caryatid, frontal view, which was supposed to be hidden from anyone who didn't know where to look for it.  The other ones might have been hidden because they were smiling, or too luscious, and placed there as a special reward for those who happened to be reading the book slowly enough to discover them.<br />Thirdly, the next section, Sculptural heads, starting on page 237, doesn't have much to say, but the comparison of the drawings of Head in left profile runs from pages 255 to 263, without numbers on some pages.  Plate 194, Head in left profile with earring; Blue crayon heightened with red gouache, is large and colorful.  In the later sections of the book, there is a study with blue ink on page 368, and my favorite color in the book is the blue ink on pages 389, 390, and 392.

When I was young, I was taught that I should appreciate J. S. Bach and other musical geniuses about like Walter Kaufmann grew up thinking that Hegel was really something. Kaufmann and I have both noticed how reluctant Hegel was to admit who he was talking about, so he considers it an anomaly on page 490 of the J. B. Baille translation of THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF MIND that the name Oedipus has been inserted into the sentence \\"In the story of *OEdipus* the son does not see his own father in the person of the man who has insulted him . . .\\" Walter Kaufmann lists the persons whom Hegel actually mentioned in his manuscript (\\"only thirteen men and women are named.\\" p. 125). I would say Kaufmann left out Julius Caesar, since the preface happens to discuss historical facts like the year in which Caesar was born. Reading the translation of the preface by Walter Kaufmann in HEGEL TEXT AND COMMENTARY, a separate paperback volume with the same index as HEGEL A REINTERPRETATION, is the best approach for understanding Kaufmann's method of explaining Hegel. His commentary in that book is mostly in the form of notes at particular places in the text, and they do not always refer to persons that might have been meant by Hegel, as a lot of philosophy has happened since Hegel, and Walter Kaufmann was aware of various interpretations and more modern philosophers like Kierkegaard and Heidegger (who, \\"unlike Hegel, seeks to move philosophy closer to poetry rather than science.\\" note 10 on Commentary page 93). Having HEGEL A REINTERPRETATION as a separate book allows Kaufmann to try to demonstrate the scope of philosophy in a way that Hegel attempted to do, encompassing it all as no one had tried to do since Aristotle.<br />I learned a lot reading this book years ago, allowing myself to feel a lot like Fichte in the comparison, \\"Nobody today would rank Fichte with Kant;\\" (p.110). Self-consciousness in German is not quite what it is in America today, but a large part of how modern the intrusive nature of our media has allowed us to become is the constant measure of our own sorry self-consciousnesses becoming aware of each other, a very Hegelian philosophical theme. The appreciation of particular geniuses in our own day might be troubled by knowledge such as Kaufmann's, that \\"There are not many non-German composers in a class with Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven; and during their era German poetry was coming into its own, too. The great achievements of the period were triumphs of the artistic imagination.\\" (p. 114).  Our own composers always seem to be thinking about something else instead of what it would take to make their music better.<br />Did anybody notice how long the song \\"Lily Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" was on Bob Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" album? If \\"the drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind\\" could be applied to philosophy, it might be as a form of consciousness which seeks to avoid an overwhelming awareness of anything which is actually going on. Hegel ought to be considered good for philosophy in the way that Bob Dylan would be good for people whose interest in music involves owning the rights to the songs. The big legal questions in our society are about who has to pay for people to keep singing or swapping this stuff. Most people who buy this book will read it as consumers. Hegel was usually not a philosopher to be considered dangerous, but somehow, people like Marx, who read Hegel as an introduction to how unsettled things of their own day were, were dangerous in a lot of intellectual fields. I learned a lot about Fichte the first time I read this book.  His attempt to identify God with a moral world order is clearly stated, and it only takes a little knowledge of human nature to see how his career suffered the consequences, with the result, \\"Accused of atheism, he published a couple of vigorous defenses in 1799 and threatened to resign if reprimanded, which was construed as a resignation--andhe was let go.\\" (p. 102). Hegel managed to avoid getting clobbered in that kind of argument, and modern philosophy has a lot of appreciation for everything he managed to say without causing a lot of trouble. This book pulls it all together.he was let go.\\" (p. 102).

Karl Marx  obtained his doctorate in philosophy in 1841, based on a thesis on post-Aristotelian Greek philosophy.  He became a newspaper editor in 1842, until the government closed the publication.  Marx moved to Paris, and wrote THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY in 1847.  (p. 5).  Most Americans believe that the American revolution was fought to establish principles of equality.  As equals of anyone, we certainly don't think of ourselves as having fought the American revolution against our own government.  Marx and Engels created the COMMUNIST MANIFESTO in 1847, a mere 14 years before the American Civil War, when it seemed like Americans on both sides were being blamed for fighting against a Union or the rights of states, and the Americans who were on the same side as General Sherman had the clearest picture of their military policy (war is hell).<br />THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY was written just before Marx might have been considered the founder of a settled doctrine, but it is full of signs that Marx saw how necessary it was that those who would rule should think like a government, or like a burning bush, and more honest than the law could ever be.  Most of the observations in this book are based upon economic considerations.  In pure economics, the almighty dollar would be the standard for determining matters of exchange, but this book is in search of a basis for political economics.  In opposition to the political economics of Proudhon, which was based on the idea of equality, Marx wrote:<br />Hypotheses are only made in view of some end.  The end proposed to itself in the first place by the social genius which speaks by the mouth of M. Proudhon, was the elimination of that which was evil in each economic category, in order to have only the good.  For him good, the supreme good, the true practical end, is equality.  And why does the social genius propose equality rather than inequality, fraternity, Catholicism, or any other principle?  Because \\"humanity has realized successively so many particular hypotheses only in view of a superior hypothesis,\\" which is precisely equality.  In other words:  because equality is the ideal of M. Proudhon.  He imagines that the division of labor, credit, the workshop, that all the economic relations have been invented only for the benefit of equality, and nevertheless they have always finished by turning against her.  From the fact that the history and the fiction of M. Proudhon contradict each other at every step, he concludes that there is a contradiction.  If there is a contradiction it exists only between his fixed idea and the real movement.<br />Henceforth the good side of an economic relation is that which affirms equality, the bad side is that which denies it and affirms inequality.  Every new category is a hypothesis of the social genius to eliminate the inequality engendered by the preceding hypothesis.  To sum up, equality is the primitive intention, the mystic tendency, the providential end, that the social genius has before its eyes in turning round and round in the circle of economic contradictions.  Providence is also the locomotive which conveys all the economic baggage of M. Proudhon better than his pure and heedless reason.  (p. 129)<br />In the time of Marx, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and proletariat classes was political, but the almighty dollar has managed to produce a politics which is fundamentally only for those of standing, who have \\"conflicting, antagonistic interests, inasmuch as they find themselves opposed by each other.  This opposition of interests flows from the economic conditions of their bourgeois life.\\"  (pp. 133-4).  According to Marx, any attempt by a humanitarian school of economics was doomed to have a theory which was actually based \\"upon interminable distinctions between theory and practice, between principles and results, between the idea and the application, between the content and the form, between the essence and the reality, between right and fact, between the good and evil side.\\"  (p. 135)  Marx proposes an ability to see beyond this, imagining the power of \\"the revolutionary subversive side which will overturn the old society.\\"  (p. 137).  Even without communism, the papers are full of the efforts of the doomed to try this stunt, and of the government to stop them.  General Sherman was as American as any economist.ce and the reality, between right and fact, between the good and evil side.\\"  (p. 135)  Marx proposes an ability to see beyond this, imagining the power of \\"the revolutionary subversive side which will overturn the old society.\\"  (p. 137).

Big books are heavy, and knowing that I can find every picture that is still known of a particular artist takes some of the excitement out of seeing what is on the next page.  Some of the early pages, and even worse, plates 62 and 63, have pictures in black and white, which isn't the way I expect to see them, because I know they have been robbed of the original color.  The list of plates numbers 73, which is a fair number for 80 pages.  The Contents lists 8 topics, all of which are interesting enough, and \\"The Artist and Society\\" was particularly a problem for Egon Schiele. I think the most is packed into those seven pages, which includes pictures of Lovers 1911, Self-Portrait 1912, Agony 1912, Nude Black-Haired Girl Standing 1910, Prisoner! 24 April 1912, Cardinal and Nun 1912, Hindering the Artist is a Crime, It Is Murdering Life in the Bud! 23 April 1912, For my Art and for My Loved Ones I will Gladly Endure to the End! 25 April 1912, and Fighter 1913.  I relate most strongly to the (in prison)autobiographical portraits, and I'm disappointed that Self-Portrait with Hand to Cheek 1918 is not in color on page 27, but the explanation on the following page is good, even if it mentions his critics:  \\"Alessandra Comini has put forward the convincing explanation that, whatever else it may mean, the gesture is a punning reference to the artist's name:  in German the verb schielen means to squint, and apparently a number of hostile critics used this correspondence to make sarcastic jokes about Schiele's eyesight.\\"  (p. 28)  Plate 72 is a late portrait which I have seen in an art museum, exhibited with other paintings.  The paint covers the canvas and it is signed, Egon Schiele 1918, the year of Schiele's death, but the final comment of this book is \\"This, the most painterly of all his late works, is a final, monumental statement of Schiele's vision of the artist.  It was left unfinished at his death.\\"  It is not clear from the picture what more he might have done, and he previously had left things out.  If he was going to finish anything, I think he should have given the Black-Haired Girl Standing in 1910 a right elbow.m the picture what more he might have done, and he previously had left things out.

The philosophical side of this book might be a strong support for the idea that philosophy was in bad shape when Nietzsche found it.  The political side of the book ought to establish that it was no wonder.  Before I bought this book, I had a copy of THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY by Karl Marx, which was written when Nietzsche was quite young.  It was an attack on the thoroughly political view of economics which had been adopted by Proudhon.  According to Berlin, \\"Marx was convinced that Proudhon was constitutionally incapable of grasping the truth; that, despite an undoubted gift for telling phrases, he was a fundamentally stupid man; the fact that he was brave and fanatically honest, and attracted a growing body of devoted followers, only made him and his fantasies more dangerous;\\" (Berlin, p. 87).  In a move that is sure to remind historians of how often Communists turned against others who thought that they were on the same side, Marx's book attacked the roots of Proudhon's system in Chapter 2, The Metaphysics of Political Economy, with his usual summary of Hegel.  \\"As to those who are not acquainted with Hegelian language, we would say to them in the sacramental formula, affirmation, negation, and negation of the negation. . . . Instead of the ordinary individual, with his ordinary manner of speaking and thinking, we have nothing but this ordinary manner, pure and simple, minus the individual.\\"  (Marx, p. 115).<br />Berlin is capable of providing summaries of the issues, even admitting that \\"Marx took immense trouble to demonstrate that Proudhon was totally incapable of abstract thought, a fact which he vainly attempted to conceal by a use of pseudo-Hegelian terminology.  Marx accused Proudhon of radically misunderstanding the Hegelian categories by naively interpreting the dialectical conflict as a simple struggle between good and evil, which leads to the fallacy that all that is needed is to remove the evil, and the good will remain.  This is the very height of superficiality:  to call this or that side of the dialectical conflict good or bad is a sign of unhistorical subjectivism out of place in serious social analysis.\\"  (Berlin, pp. 85-86).<br />The current clash of civilizations might be considered as stupid as anything that Marx analyzed in Proudhon's system, by those who are sure that philosophy is a style adopted by the good side, while anyone who has adopted the politics of mounting destructiveness has all the faults which the free world has always attributed to communism.  Plenty of poisons have entered this contest in the last 155 years, since Karl Marx tried to side with the rising class while arguing against their unexamined notions of good and evil, but philosophies have been as powerless on this kind of question as Nietzsche might be considered absurd for attempting to encompass powerful ideas.  People who can't relate to this book must lack an appreciation for something that philosophers always wanted, even in the days of the pre-Platonics.  It might be considered tough to read, having been revised little since it was Isaiah Berlin's first great book in 1939.  I thought it was better than a lot of what I have tried to read about Hegel, and I wasn't trying very hard.perficiality:  to call this or that side of the dialectical conflict good or bad is a sign of unhistorical subjectivism out of place in serious social analysis.\\"  (Berlin, pp. 85-86).<br />The current clash of civilizations might be considered as stupid as anything that Marx analyzed in Proudhon's system, by those who are sure that philosophy is a style adopted by the good side, while anyone who has adopted the politics of mounting destructiveness has all the faults which the free world has always attributed to communism.

This book by Reinhard Steiner gives a very intellectual treatment to the art of Egon Schiele.  From pages 9 to 11, Nietzsche is quoted as a guide to the self, and for the first quote, Steiner must be translating from the German himself, for the footnote is not to an English version of Nietzsche's work.  Could this be familiar?<br />It is a theatre of the self which is in dangerous proximity to Friedrich Nietzsche's aphoristic description (in 1888) of the modern artist:  &quot;The modern artist, physiologically close kin to the hysteric, bears the signs of hysteria in his very character too . . . The absurd excitability of his constitution, which makes a crisis of every experience and drags drama into the merest chances of life, renders him utterly unpredictable:  he is no longer one person, but at most a gathering of persons, and now this one, now that will be conspicuous amongst them, with unabashed confidence. . . .&quot;  (pp. 9-10).<br />Almost everything in the book is reproduced in color, but the paintings might not please everyone.

I am not overly familiar with this book.  It is the most recent translation of a major work by Heidegger that I have seen this year, and I thought I ought to look into it to see if the thinking around Heidegger is getting any better for me personally.  The more I know about philosophy, the less I have to read to start getting an opinion of my own, and a page of this stuff was usually enough to put me in a different frame of mind.  Plowing on after I lost my idea of whatever thread I was following had a tendency to be soporific, so I recommend this book to people who have a lot of time to sleep.<br />There is a little section 72, &quot;Nihilism&quot; on pages 96-8 which makes me think philosophy must mean a lot less now than when Nietzsche inspired Heidegger to write, &quot;Nihilism in Nietzsche's sense means that all goals are gone&quot; (p. 96).  For the 20th century to produce a great philosopher like Heidegger and put him in the midst of some of the greatest political foolishness of the 20th century, and have most professional philosophers think that he was showing too much activism when he joined the Nazi party, but was being extremely professional when he managed to maintain his standing in the party while Hitler was in power by not saying anything bad about Hitler, makes me think the comedians of the age might have been in a better position to do some political thinking.  In the movie, &quot;The Dance of Genghis Cohn,&quot; a little dummy that looks like Hitler was the kind of funny bit which got the comedian beat up by some younger members of the Nazi party right after the show.  That kind of German society seems to be what Heidegger has most on his mind in his description of nihilism.  &quot;Proof for this is the gigantically organized event for shouting down this anxiety. . . . The most disastrous nihilism consists in passing oneself off as protector of Christianity . . . on the basis of social accomplishments&quot; (p. 97).  Younger people than Heidegger have found a lot of individual ways for having goals, and the main reason that they haven't been able to put it together is that a collection like the United Stoners of America is not naturally cohesive.  Heidegger was a long way from wanting that to be so out in the open.  He must attempt to be so philosophical that his last sentence for the section on nihilism is &quot;Instead this awareness must recognize the abandonment of being as essential sway.

The situation in this book, a couple in a canoe, could be used to understand a lot of situations, if all of the incite provided by Theodore Dreiser were applied.  Most obviously to me, it seems that American policy in Vietnam was shaped by someone who thought that the map of Nam looked a lot like a canoe, without noticing that the American half looked a lot more like a canoe than the other half did.  I also find that the book is related to philosophy.  The guy in the book is not presented as knowing a lot of philosophy, but most of what most people would accept as good philosophy is like knowing that a guy has a choice between being happy that a woman is not pregnant, or happy that a woman is pregnant, but if he is unhappy that a woman is pregnant, he is more likely to fall back on something in his unconscious, like the man in this book kept thinking about her inability to swim.  I think women would have been more likely to learn to swim back when this book was set if they didn't have to wear so many clothes.  Some of my contacts with philosophy have led me to believe that philosophy is a lot like the clothes that the woman was wearing.  The woman in the water might have been a lot closer to learning to swim if she had gotten out of her clothes, but she was at a public lake.<br />The position that the guy finds himself in at the end of the book, being considered responsible for the woman's death, greatly resembles the failure of the American policy of Vietnamization in the 1970s.  America had the ability to withdraw its forces from Vietnam by promising both sides that it would pay them to keep killing each other, but actually looking at it that way seemed like a bad deal to the US Congress, which was supposed to make it happen by providing the money.  People who understand this book might know what I mean.	2001-08-11

I recently looked back into this book for a sense of what made Heidegger unique in 20th century philosophy.  A lot of philosophers were facing political questions in the years in which Heideggers support of Hitler made his professional advancement possible.  This book is not trying to pick on Heidegger in an individual way in its overall approach to the situation, even when it points out that those professors whose careers were cut short when Heidegger found them unGerman were also not unique.  Any problems which I may be having, dealing with my own political opinions related to the concept of how crisis, modernity, and what is German, all of which this book considers in a conservative way relating to Fichte at the birth of the political, become strictly my own personal problems as long as I am inclined to see things from a more radical perspective inspired by Nietzsche.  At the young age of 33 I tried to deflect a lot of these things off myself by reflecting them back on Walter Kaufmann, who had translated THE GAY SCIENCE by Nietzsche into English in 1974.  Given the uncertain nature of my life at that time, it would have been difficult for him to tell me that I had been trying to read philosophy too politically, because, for all he knew, being political might have turned out to be important to me in my life.<br />This book mentions a few very German thinkers who are now familiar to me:  Carl Schmitt, and two brothers named Gehlen.  Two of those three might be considered unnerving, because Schmitt would withhold judgment about anything important until the basic condition of friend or foe had been established, and one of the Gehlen brothers was involved in a kind of intelligence which evaluated information strictly on how reliable a source the information could be attributed to.  Those who know me must be glad that I havent managed to be any more political than I have been for both reasons, be they friend or foe, as I feel highly suspect in either of those categories.  What really tied Fichte to Heidegger for me in this book was the bold statement on page 39, in Fichtes Addresses to the German Nation.  There must always be one who is first; then let him be first who can.  Now that everybody knows that it didnt work out well for Heidegger, anyones willingness to do that politically for philosophy is highly suspect, and modern philosophy seems to be just as likely to belittle any individual attempter as any other element of modernity will tend to chaos.<br />What I understood in this book when I read it a few years ago seems obvious to me now, but there is a lot more philosophy than I really like, and it is tough to say that any of it is more important than the philosophy.  If Walter Kaufmann paid any attention to my views on Nietzsche, it might have been because I was some indication that an element of chaos had become so obvious in America (the hypersexuality of sex, soldiers and swearing was not a topic covered by this book, or philosophy in general) that some ideas might actually be considered important in restoring a sense of order, a topic which is mentioned in this book, but order has not been an aspect of the modern intellect which it has been possible for me to deal with personally.ies.

It is too bad that there isn't as much information shown about the music in this book as great marketing of CDs provides for some popular items.  I recently heard Eric Clapton play in Saint Paul, and I'm sure thousands of people know a lot of the songs in this book, but after a concert, I enjoy looking at the book to see if anything that is down in black and white makes more sense than it did when I heard it.  My best example would be the song &quot;Layla.&quot;  In the book, it is written in a key of D flat, with a few changes for the verses, chorus, and instrumental at the end.  The music in the book doesn't try to show everything going on at the same time, so it never seems to be as complicated as the song itself.  After all these years of trying to put the opening notes together, I have finally heard this song often enough so that the quick run at the beginning is just what I'm thinking when I try to play it.  People who can't get to that point will not enjoy this book very much, but people who really don't know if they could put a few parts of this song together from a bunch of notes ought to make the effort.  One of the verses starts out, &quot;I tried to give you consolation, . . .&quot; but people who really know this song probably remember the line, &quot;before I finally go insane,&quot; better.  Having this book might not be good for everybody, but being able to play this stuff is great, as far as I'm concerned.  Give it a try.	2001-07-31

This is the work in which Hegel called the absolute that night in which all cows are black.  Those people who think that philosophy is impossibly complicated might start by looking at Walter Kaufmann's comments on how bad the other translations and comments on this amazingly swift work by Hegel have been.  The other bit of humor here is Hegel attacking philosophy in a way that can only seem to be a personal attack on the views of Schelling, and then Walter Kaufmann thinks Hegel lied when he told Schelling in a letter that he wasn't thinking of him personally when he was writing about how superficial philosophy seems to people who only read the stuff.  What is truly astounding is how inspired people feel when they right this kind of stuff.  Religion and poetry seem to be competing for inspiration that can claim to be as deep, but religious doctrines and poetic theories get rated along with stale philosophies in this kind of search for an absolute, which really might seem like a night in which all cows are black the first time through this.  It helps to have a few other books around to help comprehend this stuff by putting Hegel in a context where this summary of what his first two major works might be about (he wrote his LOGIC later) strives for some importance.  This could be as close to official German university philosophy as any student would ever understand, but Hegel might be found complaining here that students don't understand a lot of this any more than other people.	2001-06-23

Morality is subject to some rolling blackouts in this book.  At the end, the law stepped in and made sure that the destruction was mutual.  Law seems to be particularly inept in situations where a book is this hard on the reader, and those critics in the Norton Critical Edition who consider this novel almost a crime against literature have a point.  If all the characters were being put on trial, instead of merely trying to live, the law would allow each of them to be tried separately because of the doctrine of mutually antagonistic defenses.  There were parts of this book I enjoyed:  Angel Clare sorting the cows for milking made a lovely theme.  Hardy kept referring to the barnyard as a &quot;barton,&quot; but I'm sure he wasn't directing that jibe at me, personally, because this book was written long before I was born.  I've been to barnyards that were as full of &quot;mulch&quot; as the &quot;barton&quot; described in this book, and Hardy is putting things mildly.  I liked the part when Alec had been reformed and Tess discovered him preaching to the Methodists without thinking that he was any better for all the things he was trying to say.  Somehow Alec getting on the other side of things was still Alec, and he would have preferred to be happy than to preach all the time.  For me, the plot revolved around Angel Clare's need to find a place where he could get money without shame.  Alec had as much money as Tess would ever need, and he wanted to give it to her in his own way.  There is an early baby problem that Tess didn't tell Alec about until they had more problems than any novelist could make disappear.  D. H. Lawrence tried to understand this book in unfulfilled male and female principles, and aristocratic principles which isolated Tess and Alec d'Uberville.  I'm glad this book has been appreciated so long that I finally read it.  It was an involvement that went further than just feeling like a barnyard.	2001-05-30

I'm much more excited about this book than the first time I reviewed it.  It was written back in 1992, and I could have considered it one of the most American studies of Nietzsche to be produced in the late 20th century.  What made my first review exciting was how well I managed to ghost Walter Kaufmann in writing that review.  Kaufmann had chosen to be a professor in the philosophy department of a great American university, at a time when cultured people everywhere might expect a modern philosophy to be enthralled with the idea of philosophy forming a basis for world order striving for the kind of educated greatness enhanced by Emerson.  Since reading more of Emerson, I must rate him more highly than in my first review of this book, particularly in his work on Plato.  Nietzsche might join Emerson in the view &quot;the bitten world holds the biter fast by his own teeth.&quot;  That is what Emerson noticed after:  &quot;so all this mammoth morsel has become Plato.  He has clapped copyright on the world.&quot;  Walter Kaufmann and I may have differed from each other generationally in our views on how well rock 'n' roll might also claim the world.  Philosophy is much more difficult to discuss than the most recent songs, and the people who might read this book for professional reasons wouldn't have much excitement to talk about, so the years passed this book by in stony silence until I came along and compared it to what Walter Kaufmann said about this kind of simple comparison of the views of another with Nietzsche.  Hegel set the standard for making philosophical comparisons, and Kaufmann kept trying to show how German this approach is.  I really liked the idea of Kaufmann having an American alter ego who was going to make decisions based on the line, &quot;Common, it'll be fun.&quot;  This worked for me better after I tried it than before.	2001-05-30

I checked the index to Walter Kaufmann's translation to this book to see if it had anything to recommend on war.  In the section listed, 273 I think, Nietzsche happened to mention how much comedy and concealment there is in war.  The rest of the aphorism probably tries to point out something that living people might be able to use.  I think it was something about having objectives.  What I find so interesting in Nietzsche is how often he can get carried away with some point that living people would not want to know, like how much comedy there is in war.  As a famous lonely thinker, he must keep track of his mind like someone whose friends are all dead or in jail.  The apostle Paul used to write letters when he was in prison, so Nietzsche could probably imagine what he was really thinking while he diverted himself by writing letters to the churches who get major mention in the New Testament, the kind of thing which Nietzsche's mother wanted him to study for a truly holy occupation.  Nietzsche was wild enough to try a few things that had not been done so thoroughly before, and writing on a few themes that philosophers had tried in milder forms in the centuries after hemlock had been given to Socrates to express how the living political crowd in Athens felt about all his questioning might have given him the courage to declare a war on the dead, in his own way, as his form of life.  Those who confuse Nietzsche's efforts with the steps taken by political crowds in their attempts to govern might not be crazy enough to understand what philosophy is all about when the comic elements in war become the primary reason for embracing war.  I lack a better explanation for this book.	2001-05-24

It is difficult for me to get past the first picture of the old temple in Cambodia, taken by Walter Kaufmann in 1963, at the beginning of this book.  The day has its hours and minutes, but Cambodia has its years.  It has been 31 years since I was in Cambodia, and the artistic possibilities of that much time don't apply in abstract ways, like taking that many years away from being funny.  Most of the pictures in this book try to find something to praise in old things, including mummies, and the &quot;old is beautiful&quot; theme seemed perfectly appropriate for a philosophy which was so wrapped up in living.  I didn't think this book was as deep as some that I have read.  I can't imagine what would ever make a book like this popular, but that hasn't usually been my concern.  If I tried to produce a philosophy of time that could encompass the confusion which the really famous philosophers of the 20th century produced on that subject, I would only be misleading the readers of this review about the nature of this book.  This is just a study in time appreciation, like an ecologist might like trees and animals.  Barely literate scholars might assume they are studying philosophy when they read this book, but I'm not going to say anything that would make it seem at a lower level than what it is.  This is a picture book by someone who appreciated poetry and philosophy, had great taste in literature, but was trying to communicate with people who had no sense of greatness.  Or maybe I'm missing something because I didn't notice anything heroic.	2001-05-24

I read this book in an English translation which was copyright 1968, and I am sorry to see that the English title, THE DANCE OF GENGHIS COHN, is no longer on the market.  If there is any question of people laughing about some intellectual alliance between a new country which was created after World War II and Germans, the arch-enemy of the ghost who is the title character of this book, the lack of this title to laugh it is a small price to pay for &quot;Peace to our ashes,&quot; and ashes to Ashcroft, while we're at it, or whatever.	2001-04-28
