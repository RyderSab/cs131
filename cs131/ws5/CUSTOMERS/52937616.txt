I was very disappointed. First off, the book seems light on both information about stevia and recipes.  But more important, as a few other reviewers have noted, the recipes that are contained in the book are either so unappealing you have no desire to make them, or don't taste very good once you do make them.  For example, I wanted a few good pudding recipes.  The butterscotch pudding contains 4 cups of yams.  The lemon pudding has yellow squash as its base.  Now, I'm all for vegetables, but when I'm eating dessert, I want dessert.  Not squash puree. I made a spaghetti squash recipe that had proportionally so much stevia it was sickening.  I'm a good and experienced cook. These recipes were awful.  Not recommended.	2005-02-05

So far, everything I've tried has been very good-- I had no idea that you could pressure cook a pot of pasta in just a few minutes with only a small amount of liquid.  But her pasta with butternut squash and ricotta was very tasty and not at all mushy as I'd feared.  I appreciate that after each recipe she lists several variations, including vegetarian versions where possible. I find that many of her recipes require some seasoning adjustments as they can tend slightly on the bland side.  But as a book on basic technique, it's indispensable.	2004-12-27
US	52937616	RL2SNROM6A5TE	0870113992	14984625	Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art	Books	5	17	18	N	Y	Wonderful Book	I have a few Japanese cookbooks that I never use because they seem to be just random collections of recipes.  Though I love Japanese food, I had always been a bit intimidated by the thought of cooking it, because the ingredients and techniques are so far from those I usually use in my cooking.  I have to say I love this book.  Not only for the throrough introduction to Japanese ingredients, cooking techniques and food culture, but also because the author makes all of this understandable to the Western cook.  Some of the recipes are time intensive, but I appreciate that whenever possible, he also includes short-cuts (for example, while he shows the way to make dashi from scratch, he also identifies an instant dashi mix that produced great results).  The recipes I've made so far almost all came out quite similarly to those I have enjoyed in Japanese restaurants. Enthusiastically recommended.	2004-12-22

The recipes are terrific. I also have Casas' Delicioso! (which I highly recommend as well), but I prefer this book because it is better organized, with more of the standard Spanish recipes I crave (seafood with green sauce, scallops with sherry sauce, etc.-- fantastic).  But with her later books such as Delicioso, Casas (or her editor) has learned to provide clearer, more accurate cooking instructions.  In The Foods and Wines of Spain, the instructions are much more vague. How high should the heat be on the stove? How long should you sautee the onions? What does it mean exactly to \\"dust\\" something with flour? These things are often not spelled out.  I am a pretty experienced cook but I would definitely benefit from some better instructions in some of the recipes. I can see how this book would be confusing for the novice cook or someone fairly new to Spanish cuisine-- if you are in this category you might want to start out with Delicioso!.	2004-12-22

I am an avid stir-fry cook and this book has some great wok stir-fry recipes, but it has so much more. It is a comprehensive guide to wok history, culture, maintenance and cooking techniques-- and demonstrates how a wok can be used for so much more than stir-fry.  The recipes are great and pretty foolproof.  I also own The Chinese Kitchen, by Eileen Yin-Fei Lo.  I like that book and use it often, but especially on busy weeknights, I appreciate that the recipes in Breath of a Wok generally call for far fewer ingredients and taste just as good.	2004-12-22

I was particularly interested in how to bring out the flavor and tenderness in some of the cheaper cuts.  So I bought this book, and it didn't disappoint.  Not only do the authors explain everything under the sun about how to choose and buy meat and which cuts work best with different types of cooking methods, but they also provide scores of delicious recipes.  For most types of meat, they will give you a \\"master recipe\\" outlining the basics, and then a range of flavor/sauce variations.  The recipes range from good to excellent-- they call for a nice variety of ingredients, but they are not by any means overly-sophisticated or inaccessible. Lisa's Lazy Pot Roast is the best pot roast I've ever made. <br /> <br />The book has also introduced me to methods for improving my execution of dishes I was already familiar with. Thanks to the authors, my stovetop porkchops are much juicier than they had been before.  The temperature doneness chart alone almost justifies the price of the book-- I'm constantly referring to it whether or not I'm using one of the book's recipes. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves meat and wants to broaden their horizons in this area.	2004-12-11

I had always looked down on slow cookers, primarily because I always associated them with Campbells \\"cream of\\" soup cooking.  This book impressed me because the recipes are healthier and more sophisticated than the other books I looked at.<BR>So far, I have made 6 recipes from the book.  All have been good and some really delicious.  I made very good veal stew and pot roast and some decent pasta sauce.  Right now I have his beef chili simmering away and it smells fantastic.  Here are some of the negatives:<BR>*There is some minimal prep work involved in most of his dishes, such as browing the meat, sometimes sauteeing onions and vegetables, etc. This is not really a downside for me, as I think it is ridiculous to expect to be able to just toss things in a pot and have a dish come out well.  The prep work doesn't usually take more than 15 minutes or so, and that is time that I will gladly put in to improving the quality of my meal.<BR>*Many of the dishes are, to my tastes, underseasoned.  The spicy dishes are not hot enough, garlicy dishes need more garlic, etc. If you have a bolder palate, you will need to learn to adjust the seasonings.  I don't consider this a real downside to the book either, as I bought the book more to learn slow cooker technique.<BR>*Almost all of the recipes in the book are geared to a 3 1/2 quart cooker. Most cookers sold these days are larger-- mine, and the ones I mostly see in the stores, are 6 quart.  So the timing he uses in the book will ususally have to be adjusted for a larger cooker, sometimes as much as a few additional hours in my case.<BR>But despite these drawbacks, I like the book and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for some tasty slow cooker recipes or pointers on technique, and won't freak out spending a few minutes on prep work.  If you are new to slow cooking like me, after trying a few of theserecipes and understanding the methods involved, you will be much better equipped to branch out on your own and become creative with your own recipes, too.	2004-01-28

I was thoroughly disappointed by this book.  It is not a comprehensive manual, but a series of (VERY) short essays, most of them not going beyond the obvious.  For example, there is a section on using public speaking to promote yourself and your book.  It sites just one website as the ultimate source to look at for speaking opportunities-- shawguides.com-- and while I'm sure this is a fine site, it is not applicable to the vast majority of writers out there.  It is a shame the authors didn't take the time to do any further research to make the book more widely relevant, or to provide real resources on many of the topics they address.<BR>If you are a total, and I mean total novice to computers and the internet-- for example, if you don't know much about word processing programs or what a newsgroup is-- this book may be helpful to you.  But if you come into this with any prior knowledge whatsoever, no matter how basic, you may find this book a complete waste of money.	2004-01-14

The meze (Turkish appetizer) recipes are uniformly terrific-- the spicy pureed feta and spicy tomato recipes alone justify the price of the book.  They have become standards in our house and are requested by guests time and time again.  For the most part, the dishes are easy to make, although a few are labor intensive. Instructions are clear. The pictures make one's mouth water. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is that I most enjoy cookbooks that both have good recipes and are fun to read.  There is not much to read in this book other than the recipes.	2003-12-17

I own so many cookbooks I don't use that generally before I buy a new one, I get a library copy and test some recipes.  Prior to borrowing this book, I tried out 3 different Thai/SE Asian cookbooks, and rejected them all for being either too complicated for everyday cooking, or not &quot;authentic&quot; enough. One look at this book and I ordered it.  The recipes have been uniformly excellent-- the grilled chicken with hot and sweet dipping sauce and several of the vegetable dishes introduced me to delicious taste combinations that I have never experienced in Thai restaurants. More common dishes such as the stir fried chicken with holy basil and the pad thai are as good as-- or better-- than most of the restaurant Thai that I have had. I can't wait to try more. The ingredients are relatively easy to find, and they do suggest substitutions in many instances. On top of all that, it is a beautiful book to own. I am definitely buying multiple copies of this book to give as holiday gifts this year.	2003-10-13

I don't like using no-fat ingredients, fake butter, artificial sweetener, etc.  To me, they make the food not worth eating, much less cooking.  What I like about this book is that Pepin shares creative, inventive recipes that incorporate butter and oils in moderation, and he shows that you do not have to use a lot of these for a dish to be flavorful.  It is all in the seasonings and preparation.  And this is a cookbook that you can use on an everyday basis, as the recipes truly are simple... some of them so simple that you wonder how good it will really be.  I have made over a dozen dishes from the book so far, and have not yet found a bad one.	2002-12-07

I was just out of grad school, and had no idea how to cook anything, much less chicken.  For the next 2 years or so, whenever I had friends over (which was often), I cooked almost exclusively from this book, and got the reputation as the best cook around.  Although my cooking abilities and tastes have expanded since then, I still look at this cookbook as a must for beginning cooks.  The recipes are easy to follow, and organized by cooking method (ie., bake, fry, etc.)  The instructions are very clear, the recipes are uncomplicated and use ingredients that are easy to find, yet are very tasty.  Even now, while I don't follow the recipes exaclty anymore, the book is a good source of ideas.	2002-11-24

Although some of the recipes are \\"dated\\" in that they are overly fussy, there are so many recipes in here that have become staples over the years and that get consistent raves every time I prepare them.  The carrot and squash puree, the black and white bean salad... even the Thanksgiving turkey and stuffing recipe... I have made over and over and never get tired of them.  That is more than I can say for some of the dozens of other cookbooks that are collecting dust on my shelves.  The recipes are not \\"beginners recipes\\" by any means in the same sense as the Fanny Farmer cookbook, and yet when I first got this book, I was in my 20's and not at all experienced in the kitchen.  But the recipes were clear and easy to follow, and I credit this cookbook with helping to move me up to the \\"next level\\" in my cooking all those years ago.	2002-10-31

Every recipe we've tried has been delicious and authentic.  While we are not novice cooks, we knew little about Chinese ingredients and next to nothing about Chinese cooking techniques.  But the recipes are so clear and easy to follow, that once we stocked our pantry, we were producing wonderful tasting and visually pleasing dishes that put our neighborhood Chinese restaurants to shame.<br />Although the recipes generally require a fairly long list of ingredients (it is not unusual to need a few different types of soy sauce and vinegar), and you will need access to a good Asian market, you will be able to use the ingredients you buy in many different dishes.  The book opens up a new world of flavors and textures, and the author manages to inform and entertain with information on Chinese history and culture along the way.<br />This is one of the best cookbooks I've purchased, and I buy a lot of cookbooks.  Highly recommended.	2001-01-06

The strength of this book is that it gives you a great overview of different vegetables, grains etc. and the variety of things that can be done with them.  On the negative side, the instructions often lack detail.  For example, she might tell you to heat oil and saute a particular ingredient, but neglect to tell you how high the heat should be.  Also, if you tend to like highly spiced food, many of her recipes are totally bland and really need to be spiced up.  For every real &quot;winner&quot; in the book, there have been 2 or 3 things I wouldn't bother making again.	2000-10-18

It is probably somewhat helpful for those who realize that practicing law is not for them either while in law school or shortly  afterward, but there are better resources out there.  The book consists of  some introductory material which says that if you don't like law or cannot  find a decent legal job, you are not a &quot;loser,&quot; followed by a  large collection of &quot;sample&quot; letters and resumes.  You get the  idea after one or two, but as this book really has nothing else to say, the  many samples serve as redundant filler.	2000-03-03

Her chicken dishes are among the best I've made, and I am thrilled with how authentic the tapas dishes are.  The recipes are  easy to follow and most are fairly easy to prepare.  They are organized by  region rather than type of dish.

Unfortunately, the book was marred by repetition, uneven writing and most notably, the arrogant tone of  the author. It seems as if first and foremost, the author is concerned with  letting the reader know what a special human being she is.  She tells us  that people in the middle to upper range of experience shouldn't offer  their services for less than $5,000-10,000 a day, and inserts an  unnecessary chart showing us all the money she made.   While she does this  with an outward tone of &quot;you can do this too,&quot; she is intelligent  enough to know that most of us won't be commanding this money.  I was  offended by her condescention.  Nonetheless, I admire her shrewd  self-marketing.  I just wish I hadn't bought the book.	2000-02-14

While it is not a book which gives you step by step instructions for starting your own business, there are plenty of those books out there. However, for people who are working through personal  issues of dissatisfaction with their current job or working environment,  and thinking that there must be some better way, this book is  invaluable.<br />This book lets you know that you are not alone in your  thinking, and that there are many alternative ways to use one's skills,  interests and passions to achieve a more interesting life balance while  still making a comfortable living.  And it shows you that once you free  your imagination, there are limitless possibilities. Before reading the  book, I was mulling over one small germ of an idea, which I was trying to  muster the courage to act upon.  As I was reading, many other potential  money-making ideas came to mind, and I am excited to move forward.<br />While  I am content to read most self-help books free in bookstores or libraries,  I actually bought this one.	2000-02-12

This book not only  hits the nail on the head as to reasons for dissatisfaction with the law,  but offers sound ways to evaluate  possibilities for change, both inside  and outside the law, in terms of one's personal interests.  And the  examples of people who did make changes are very inspirational.  The  resources offered are the most comprehensive I've seen.  Very valuable.
