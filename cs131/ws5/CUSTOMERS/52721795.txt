I won't add to the previous reviewers' applause for Man Without A Face except to say that I found the sexualization of the relationship disturbing -- Nabokov joins NAMBLA. The intimations of homosexuality detract from the  themes of trust and redemption. Still, an excellent read and well worth the  time. Parents should be prepared to discuss the sexual implications with  their children.	1999-04-06

This issue features a treasure trove for magicians and Johnny Eck fans. The cover photo of Johnny is the best I've ever seen. Featuring excerpts from a telephone interview with the man himself, along with Johnny's typewritten unfinished autobiography, Pandemonium Vol. 3 is the only place you can find so much Johnny information in his very own words. And Johnny was a consumate story teller: his words are a treat. Lavishly garnished with fabulous photographs -- from a darling shot of Johnny and twin brother Robert as babies in frocks, through a series of photos of rehearsals for the legendary &quot;Miracles of 1937&quot; sawing-in-half routine, to an elderly Johnny grinning on the front stoop of his Baltimore row home -- this issue is a treat for the eyes as well as the brain. If you can get a copy, by all means buy it.	1998-06-07

While not on a par with Rosemary Rogers' classic  Sweet Savage Love, No Ties struggles valliantly to  give you characters almost as insipid. It has all the elements -- the young, redheaded virgin who thinks she knows everything; the dark, brooding older man with the manners of a drunken ape; and the requisite undertones of tragedy (the heroine is an orphan). Gibson, in keeping with the series' theme of &quot;kids and kisses,&quot; gives the hero custody of his orphaned nephew, a one-dimensional child of requisite pathos and cuteness. The only thing missing is a plot. At least Sweet Savage Love had that.	1998-05-06

Not only is it interesting as a study of funeral practices, but it also offers insights into business psychology, marketing, and sociology. Mitford's style is piercing and humorous (the chapter about emblaming often made me laugh out loud) while remaining very respectful of the deceased and their loved ones. Classics are never out of date -- and The American Way of Death is a classic.	1998-03-30

What they had to say was surprising: that it was not financial circumstances, or even logistics, that led them to the abortion clinic, but lack of support for the pregnancy among those closest to them. Real Choices challenges the assumption that women need abortions or even choose them for rational reasons; rather, it raises the question of whether they actually are pressured into abortion because of the laziness and disinterest of their loved ones. Real Choices is a disturbing yet heartening read.	1998-03-30

Schrank examines the ways in which we forgo what we really want -- or even asking ourselves what we really want -- and instead settle for what is in front of us. The analysis applies not only to consumerism but to modern institutions as well. Snap, Crackle, and Popular Taste is a fast and fun read, bound to get you thinking.	1998-01-11

Cold, starving, and trapped in the Andes, the survivors of a charted plane crash struggle to survive. Despairing, their families search for them. Read interweaves the stories of the survivors and their loved ones as they face insurmountable odds. A moving testimony to the power of faith -- in God and in the human spirit. The moment when Canessa's father learns that his son, whom he had given up for dead, is alive and waiting for him, is one of the greatest moments ever captured in words. Their Christmas reunion makes this a good Christmas tale.	1997-12-19

Non-Christians may find Joni's spiritual reflections tiresome or puzzling, but will still find inspiration in a young girl's transformation from suicidal despair to spiritual serenity.

The heroine, Virginia Brandon, is such a bubble-headed tease that you want to slap her silly, the way the hero frequently does, which may be why you keep turning the pages. The hero, Steve Morgan, has the morals of an alley cat and little else to recommend him. His one redeeming quality is that he hates Virginia almost as much as you do. Each of them singly is mind-numbingly stupid, and the two of them together are positively Martian. The only sensible thing either one of them does is eat, drink, or sleep -- and even then, they usually screw it up. I think what I love best about this book is that end up married, and never did any couple deserve each other more.	1997-12-17

This is a book that makes you want to wrestle people to the ground so you can read it outloud to them. In my mind the narrator always sounds like Arlo Guthrie doing Alice's Restraunt.

I didn't have a clue who Dave Barry was when I checked this book out of a library in 1984.

The New York Times refused to review Aborting America when Nathanson first relesed it -- and the reasons why will be obvious upon reading this eye-opening insider account of the political games that led to the legalization of abortion in America. Nathanson describes the side of abortion prochoicers don't want to acknowledge -- the lies masquerading as data, the seedy practitioners whose life-threatening habits are overlooked by their bedfellows, the shameless political machinations. Nathanson digresses into pontificating in the final chapters, but the meat of the story is there, and is required reading for anybody for whom ignorance is not bliss.	1997-12-16

I must admit that I'm a bit biased toward this book, because I know the author, and I know that over twenty years of research are represented here. What started out as part-time digging through coroner records and dusty court files turned into a full-time research project, and the results are staggering. It's a pity Sherlock's style is so brash. His tabloid tone detracts from the credibility of all his hard work. But believe me, he can fully document every tale he tells and every claim he makes. It's worth plowing through his digressions and diatrabes to get to the meat of the matter -- solid documentation of deaths, injuries, rapes, sordid abortion clinics, corruption that staggers belief. Just keep in mind as you read this book that the first reports of Nazi atrocities were dismissed as too fantastic to be believed. When Sherlock speaks, believe him. There is a wealth of information here, and Sherlock's biting words can be appropriate, given the subject matter.	1997-12-16

Carol Everett can paint a vivid picture, and in The Scarlet Lady she paints an unflattering self-portrait. &quot;Money, money, money. That's where my heart was,&quot; she often proclaims. The Scarlet Lady reveals how low she was willing to stoop to make a buck -- even to the point of complicity in a patient's death and the cover-up afterward. Carol's conversion to Christianity, and her exit from the abortion business, is movie-of-the-week material, and even the unbeliever will find her story riveting. An eye opener, and an excellent read.	1997-12-16

Santa Claus left the Educator Classic Library version of Howard Pyle's classic under the Christmas tree when I was all of eight years old. That beloved volume has been around the world with me, and I still pull it off the shelf and read it at least once a year --  which makes at least 28 readings to date -- and it never grows stale. Pyle's use of archaic language somehow makes the tone more intimate, as if you are really there with him, wryly observing the comings and goings of a strangely innocent if somewhat brawl-happy breed of men. Tom Sawyer would have thrived in Pyle's Sherwood. Charming, lilting, engaging, he makes his characters come alive, and creates a tale adults and children will cherish together -- my young children and my agemate friends laugh aloud with me at yet another retelling of Little John's adventures as a barefoot friar. I drew tears from a college oral interpretation class with Robin's death scene. I fell in love with Robin and his men as a child, and was drawn from that to study history and linguistics.

Crutcher makes no bones about his politics on abortion: he wants it stopped, entirely. After reading this book, the reader will have a difficult time disagreeing. His descriptions of events are often taken verbatim from hospital records, court documents, and autopsy reports. They are not for the squeamish, and bring home a reality that numbers never could.  A mother describes sitting at the bedside of her dying 13-year-old daughter: &quot;I had to keep my hand pressed over my mouth to keep from screaming in horror.&quot; A respected abortion doctor reflects on his fellows: &quot;Following good standards costs money. And people don't want to do that.&quot; An abortion clinic nurse describes her work environment: &quot;The real philosophy is, each woman is worth X amount of money and the more women we can see, the more money we can make.&quot;  Crutcher throws down the gauntlet, challenging those who defend legalized abortion to clean up their act. Yet he argues that ultimately such efforts will fail because abortion inherently contaminates everyone and everything it touches.  The first rule of battle is to know your enemy, and Crutcher left no stone unturned. Lime 5 is painstakingly documented, and his sources are unimpeachable. Whether you agree or disagree with his conclusions, he presents a picture of abortion that every American should contemplate.  Lime 5 is a must read for everyone.	1997-12-15

Though clearly romanticized and seen through the rose-colored glasses of hindsight, The Story of Jane tells a tale of women running a criminal abortion syndicate for ideological rather than financial motives. The author's treatment of Harvey Karman (whom she identifies as &quot;Jordan Bennett&quot;) overlooks the less savory aspects of his career, such as his conviction in the death of a woman in a motel-room abortion in Los Angeles, and leaves this reader wondering what else she chooses to gloss over. Nevertheless, the book is an interesting and insightful read, and worth the trouble for prolifer and prochoicer alike.	1997-12-15

For those in the middle, it is an excellent summary of prolife philosophy and the data that supports that philosophy. For the prochoice, it is a thought-provoking challenge.

However, that doesn't make her research or her observations any less valid today. Written with her gentle, there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I perspective, Every Woman puts a human face on the bland statistics on abortion complications. Meticulously documented, Saltenberger draws on medical journal accounts of abortion injuries and deaths, placing them in the perspective of women's lives. A must read.	1997-12-15

But this one is not particularly deserving of adulation. Although it does expose how shamelessly NARAL (then the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws) played &quot;the Catholic Card,&quot; The Abortion Papers is a disappointment for those expecting a shocking expose. This book does nothing to eclipse Aborting America, and if you have to buy only one Nathanson book, this isn't the one.	1997-12-15

A look behind the myths and legends, Lee's groundbreaking book relied on extensive interviews with the women who sought and obtained abortions -- legal, illegal, quasi-legal, and self-induced -- in the days before legalization. Lee examines the factors that led women to choose abortion, the means by which they found an abortionist, and their attitudes toward their experiences. This book is a must read for prochoice and prolife alike.	1997-12-15

Don't let the title fool you: this book did not become obsolete in 1980. Noonan provides a primer in Constitutional law as it applies to abortion in America. More recent cases have only built on their predecessors, so by all means read this important book.	1997-12-15

Readers of the true crime genre might like Sherlock's style, but most people will find him a bit too in-your-face for their taste. This is a shame, because The Scarlet Survey is a no-holds-barred look at the seamy underside of American abortion practice. Sherlock peers under every rock, and describes with gleeful loathing whatever he finds crawling there -- and there is indeed vermin galore. His sources are excellent and carefully cited. The Scarlet Survey is an eye-opener, and worth the read if you can get past the tone.	1997-12-15

Prolifer and prochoicer alike will find this book informative. The authors hold nothing back as they describe methods many women have used -- and will use again -- to obtain abortions, including fraud and filing false reports for rape. Prochoicers will find many ideas and resources, and prolifers will find political ammunition. A must read for anybody interested in understanding the mindset of the prochoice movement in the United States.	1997-12-15

It's often said that there is nothing new to say about abortion. Harrison has something new to say -- said over two decades ago and foolishly ignored.

The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) is the research arm of Planned Parenthood, and exists to give the patina of scientific respectability to Planned Parenthood ideology. Abortion and Women's Health is yet another example of this ideology disguised as science. However, the canny reader can still glean some useful data from this publication, keeping in mind that the authors' interpretation of the data is dubious at best. This publication is worth buying only for the hard-core abortion researcher.	1997-12-15

Although Hern intended his book for other practitioners, it is a valuable resource for activists, lawmakers, and attorneys. Hern, a member of the National Abortion Federation and co-author of their standards of practice, is recognized by prolifer and prochoicer alike as the foremost authority on abortion practice in the United States. Abortion Practice covers all aspects of practice, from counseling to follow-up, including guidelines for the assessment of abortion facilities. Courts have upheld Hern's guidelines as a standard of care in malpractice litigation. Public officials might consider his recommendations in drafting abortion policy, regulation, and law. Prolife and prochoice activists alike will find food for thought and political ammunition in the pages of this detailed and comprehensive work. Be forewarned that this book is not for the squeamish; but for the stalwart reader of any political or ideological persuasion, Abortion Practice is a must-buy.	1997-12-15

Denes is, in her own words, &quot;a proabortionist with a bad secular conscience.&quot; In trying to come to grips emotionally with her own abortion, she immerses herself in an abortion hospital, observing patients, staff, and herself. In Necessity and Sorrow is as much an exploration of the human condition as it is of an abortion hospital, and the observations are often bleak and disturbing. Denes brings you along on her hellish journey, compelling you to contemplate the reality behind the rhetoric. Read it and weep.	1997-12-15
