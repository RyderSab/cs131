US	48523769	R3NXLKLWS656MJ	189376205X	358314355	Arans & Celtics: The Best of Knitter's Magazine (Best of Knitter's Magazine series)	Books	5	181	184	N	N	Great classic looks collected under one cover	The decision for many buyers on whether to buy this lovely trade paperback may well rest on how long you've subscribed to Knitters Magazine and just organized you are.  This book is another in their series of &quot;best of&quot; books and it includes over 30 beautiful sweaters.  However, they only took patterns out of eight issues (16, 40,44,46,48,51,56,and 60).  So, if you've subscribed since the mid-90's (as I have) you probably own most of the patterns already.  Still, I plan to keep my copy for the sheer convenience of having so many patterns in one place and the knowledge that all the quirks should be fixed for these often complex patterns.<br />If redundancy isn't an issue for you, A&amp;C is a very appealing collection of patterns.  The format is similiar to the magazine including charts rather than line by line written instructions.  There are numerous sidebars with very handy instructions.  The look of the sweaters is essentially equally divided between the traditional and modern takes on traditional techniques.<br />While probably half the sweaters are basically unisex, the breakdown based on the gender of the models is as follows: women - 2 turtlenecks, 8 crew necks, 7 cardigans, 2 vests and 2 looks I can only describe as &quot;other.&quot;  Men are featured in 3 crewnecks and 3 vests.  Children's looks are 3 crewnecks, 1 cardigan and 1 vest.<br />This isn't a book for beginners.  Only 1 pattern is described as &quot;easy+.&quot;  The vast majority are described as intermediate with 5 advanced/expert sweaters.<br />21 sweaters call for medium weight (worsted) yarns with 7 light weight yarn sweaters and 6 bulky yarn sweaters.  Needle sizes reflect this distribution with all but 4 of the sweaters being knit on needles within the US size 4 to 8 range.<br />Bottom line:  Not a must have book for every knitter, but a worthy addition to your shelf if you like cables and texture knitting	2004-01-30

That being said, \\"The Purl Stitch\\" is a very good book overall.  <br />The book is a terrific book for the advanced beginning knitter who's ready for some interesting looks but appreciates (and needs) a detailed pattern that doesn't assume much prior knowledge.  This is the same as \\"The Knit Stitch.\\"  Where this book differs is in what it offers the advanced knitter.  The earlier book may have all been garter but the designs were so spectacular (most notetably the \\"Einstein Coat\\")that it was a \\"must have\\" book for me and most of the veteran knitters I know.  The designs in this book are still good, but because stockinette stitch and knit & purl patterns are so prevalent, the designs just seem a bit more familiar and a little less compelling. <br />For those of you who can't flip through the pages, here's a quick sense of the chapters:<BR>1. 23 pages of basic skills including the purl stitch (both right and left handed versions); purling with the yarn around your neck; decrease stitches; reverse shaping; and seaming in stockinette.<BR>2. Purling one row in six - a triangle shawl (with optional edging) and a boxy (but cute) v-necked cardigan/coat for both women and children.  It concludes with a good piece on \\"reading your knitting\\" (i.e. knowing where you are by looking at your work).<BR>3. Stockinette stitch - a shaped, fitted, rolled neck shell; an a-line jacket in bulky wool; and the turtleneck mini-dress (or top) from the front cover. The final section teaches ways of attaching new yarn and hiding the loose ends.<BR>4. Reverse stockinette with five patterns--a serape; a set in sleeve, two toned top; a unisex zippered vest; an Asian inspired cross over vest/top (cute); and kangaroo pouch hooded sweat-shirt styled tops for adults andkids.  The skill section teaches fulling (aka as felting or messing with wool and hot water).<BR>5. Ribbing - four patterns-- a raglan, open necked 2x2 ribbed snug blouse (cute); a 3x1 rib sleeveless or long-sleeved turtleneck; a 3x1 ribbed masculine pullover; and a 3x2 v-necked collegiate style unisex cardigan.  There are two many tips to list.<BR>6. \\"A little of everything\\" - two mistake rib scarves; basic cuff-down socks; a round lacy scarf/miniskirt; gauntlets (sort of like fingerless gloves); and a Canadian weight hat and mitten set for adults or kids.  The skill section is about grafting the toe stitches of socks.<BR>7. Using charts for mixed knit & purl patterns - a collared wrap; several variations of a basketweave look for adults and kids (including the ritual \\"Touch Me\\" decadent yarn top).<BR>8. The book finishes with more great advice on sizing, gauge, picking yarns and such.<br />Scattered through the book are \\"meditations\\" where Sally takes a step back from the technical stuff and muses on knitting things including a charming list of the 10 things she wishes she'd learned earlier.<br />It's a good for any knitter and should be super book for the wonderful group of folks who've taken up knitting during this latest popularity surge.  Thanks Sally for another good one.	2003-09-26

The looks are sharp but traditional enough not to go out of style quickly.  Each pattern runs 4 to 6 pages with several photo angles and detailed instructions.   The end of the book features a section on finishing tips which is most appropriate given the tailored tone of most of the sweaters.<br />For those of you who can thumb through the book before ordering, here are some details that may be helpful:<BR>     1. Colorwise, there are 14 solid color jackets and 7 multicolor slip stitch patterns.  The multi-colors are mostly tweedy looks.  Most of the solid color sweaters are knit is stitches other that stockingnette - twills, nubby textures and such.  There is only one lace project.<BR>     2. The writer/editors rate one sweater as easy; two as \\"easy plus\\"; fifteen as intermediate; and three as advanced.<BR>     3. The yarn weights are on the light side -  one in sport weight; nine in DK weight; nine in worsted weight and two in bulky.  Also, this book employees Knitter's Magazine's new generic yarn requirements system (with only small print notations of the specific yarn used in the model jacket).<BR>     4. The needles involved are also on the small side - four sweaters on US size 3; four on US size 4; two on US size 5; four on US size 6; six on US size 7; and one on US size 10.  As one knitter who is getting pretty tired of the bulky look, this is one of the best part of the book IMHO.<BR>       In summary; a great book for professionals who've had to keep their knitting in the closetor the knitters who never know what to make to the young woman lawyer in the family.	2003-03-14

This book is all about vests.  25 separate patterns for less than a dollar a pattern - a great value.  I've had the pleasure of learning vest construction from Cheryl and know that these patterns contain the little details that will make the vests work - i.e. armholes that don't gap and such.<br />For those of you thinking of buying the book sight unseen here are some details that might be helpful:<br />---three traditional fair isle designs (2 pullovers and one button front)<br />---eight single color designs - bavarian twists, the many buttoned vest (cute!); irish with the vertical x's and o's; a celtic lattice pullover; a tunic length 'bookworm' button-front; a mandarin collared texured button front; a traditional v-neck men's pullover with four columns of cables; a casual, all garter vest with a shawl collar; and a fine yarn, v-neck button front.<br />---three vests with wide vertical bands and a single button - done in African, Peruvian and Korean colorwork patterns.<br />---one vest with vertical stripes designed for the Nepalese recycled silk yarn.<br />---three vests knit fair isle style but with bold varigated yarns on a black background.<br />---two Japanese inspired panel designs.<br />---two traditional Scandanavian looks - a pullover and a button-front.<br />---a side to side vest with Navajo patterning (but easy to adapt to other looks).<br />---a traditional vest with a big lace collar.<br />Even as a person who rarely wears vests, I enjoy having this book on my shelf.  The photography is crisp and the the text is clear.  If you like to wear vests, that this book would be a treasure trove of projects.	2003-02-10

I couldn't be more delighted with what the came in the mail.  The Knitting Experience may not cover everything about knitting.  It's all about the knit stitch - nothing about purls (until the next book).  So what's in the book---<br />  1. A preface teaching the novice the basics - holding the needles, casting on, etc.<br />  2. Chapter one has several simple scarves and a triangular poncho - sized for adults and children<br />  3. Chapter two introduces knitting in the round with a mini-skirt, leggings, and a cap.  Also a flat knit cap and mittens.<br />  4. Chapter three features a jacket and vest knit from side to side.<br />  5. Chapter four features the \\"star\\" of the book - the Einstein coat which is knit in panels going different directions (very cool!). Sally offers the coat in sizes from infant to large mens.  There's also a purse and a bunting pattern.<br />  6. Chapter five features features several variations of a summer weight pullover with styling ranging from modest to sexy.<br />  7. Chapter six introduces the skill of slip stitch using the same stitch pattern in a mix of pullovers and cardigans for both children and adults.<br />  Fully half of the book is devoted to teaching skills - big sections at the beginning and end of the book and smaller sections in each chapter.  Sally offers an encylopedia of wisdom - often with a sense of humor.  Her list of 10 most significant knitting discoveries is terrific.<br />  Bottom-line - run, do not walk, to Amazon.com or whoever has this book in stock and get a copy of your own.	2003-02-05

These days there are camps all over the country but the original (and quite possibly the most widely attended) is the camp started by Elizabeth Zimmermann several decades ago.  Her daughter, Meg Swansen, now runs the camp which actually takes place in a hotel in Marshfield, Wisconsin.  It's a fabulous experience filled with beautiful yarn and loads of knitting wisdom.<br />\\"Sweaters from Camp\\" might be better titled \\"Sweaters from the Campers.\\"  A couple of years ago Meg challenged all current and former campers to design sweaters using the extensive colors (160 plus) of fingering weight shetland wool in a fair isle style format.  Campers, some who are professional designers and some who had never designed a sweater, responded.  This book is the stunning result.<br />So what might you want to know about the book if you can't look at it before buying?  Ironically, my favorite part of the book isn't the sweater patterns.  Rather it's the 27 pages at the start of the book.  This section includes 7 pages on how to design a sweater - ribbing choices, armhole options, neck shaping, sleeves from the top or bottom, and borders.  There's a handy table of suggested numbers for stitches based on size and guage.  The second half of the introduction section is an awesome collection of tips on technique.  When I attended camp, these tricks were the most valuable part of my experience.  The book lays them out in great detail.  Virtually every tip on using i-cord is offered.  Other goodies include the \\"jogless jog\\", \\"spit splicing\\", \\"knitting back backwards\\", \\"circular knitting on 2 circular needles\\", five options on steeks, swatching options, and two color knitting with two hands.  This section is worth the price of the book alone.<br />As for the sweaters, there are 13 vests - one childs, 2 mens, and ten for women.  Most are button fronts with a v-neck.  The next section, entitled \\"Small Things\\" includes two children's pullovers, tams for children and adults and a teddy bear outfit.  We're then treated to ten pullovers - mostly unisex looks.  The book concludes with a nice selection of cardigans.<br />The \\"look\\" of the book is primarily traditional fair isle.  Most of the sweaters use several colors.  My favorites are probably the less conventional sweaters.  There are several that only use two colors in all-over patterns.  There's also a terrific block effect fair isle in a child's sweater that will need translation into an adult look someday.<br />All told, it's a stunning book.  The photography is plentiful and a visual treat.  The print is large and the patterns are detailed (averaging over four pages per pattern).  Even if I never knit one of the sweaters as written, \\"Sweaters from Camp\\" will be a steady source of both pratical and inspirational ideas.	2002-11-08

Banks is a bit like scotch whiskey - an acquired taste.  Much of the pleasure in reading this book lies in knowing Banks and his supporting characters.  What kind of music will Banks be \\"into\\" in this book (it changes in each book)?  Will Susan Gay develop a life outside of her work?  What nasty tricks will Burgess be up to in this episode?  What's up with Banks' marriage and can he resist temptation one more time?<br />So, my advice to other readers is to invest the time in reading this series from the start.  The first few books are only so-so but they lay the foundations to make later books a much enjoyed reading experience.	2002-08-15

And while I give it two stars for hints of underlying promise, I gave up after 70 pages.  I only give up on about 2% of the books I start so there has to be something pretty wrong (for me - 40 something female avid reader).  In this case, it's profanity.  Now I've been know to drop a juicy four letter word once in awhile.  However, I started to be annoyed with the constant profanity in this book early on.  Then I started looking for a page with a profanity - and I couldn't find one in the next twenty pages that I read.  Bottom line -- the profanity so distracted me from the plot that I simply could not get into the book.	2002-06-28

Why?  Because I'd already learned how to knit on two circular needles (this information is available on many websites).  And I already have plenty of patterns for knitting socks from the top down.  I was really hoping that this book would have the courage to focus on socks that start at the toe but it didn't.  <br />Bottom line - if you don't have many sock patterns and haven't been able to learn the two circular method off the net, than this book is probably a good resource to own.  Otherwise, try to look at it and judge if you need it.  That caveat aside, knitting on two circular needles is absolutely wonderful and well worth learning!	2002-02-05

I expect that it well be as well used as the previous five simply because Cooking Light recipes consistently provide the interesting and healthy meals we crave.  This book contains all of the recipes from the ten issues published in 2001 as well as the &quot;how to&quot; sidebars for the recipes. <br />So what distinguishes this book relative to its predecessors?  First, the opening pages contain the staff's favorite recipes.  This is a nice place to start since the entire book can be a little overwhelming.  The bigger distinction is that the magazine's special theme in 2001 was a series on how to cook various ethnic cuisines.  These recipes strike me as be light versions of the authentic dishes without much dilution for American tastes.  The cuisines featured include: Chinese, Italian, French, Caribbean, Greek, Spanish, South America, Middle Eastern, Indian and Mexican.<br />My edition (bought directly from the publisher) included a card with a password supposedly giving me access to a website for book owners only.  This website is supposed to include more pictures and a gizmo to match what's in my pantry with recipes.  So far (three weeks), I haven't been able to access the site.<br />Otherwise, this book is a good addition to my shelf.  Now if they'd only publish an index for all six volumes....	2002-02-05

My heart sunk a little when one of the reviewers said the book was only for beginners. I've been knitting for over 30 years and teach advanced classes. Had I wasted my money? No.<br />I've been reading \\"The Joy of Knitting\\" a chapter at a time and really enjoying it. The book consists of twelve chapters. Each chapter has ten to fifteen pages of thoughtful prose followed by a project/pattern. The heart of the book is the prose. The topics include knitting how to sections about fiber, color, and texture. What sets this book apart from the others are the wonderful chapters on the greater essence of knitting -- the history of knitting; knitting groups; tricks on knitting gifts; knitting resources on the internet; computer design; the internationalization of knitting (i.e. the recent interest in Russian shawls, Latvian mittens, etc.) and a final chapter on knitting to improve the world.<br />The patterns include a simple mobius scarf,watch cap, socks, a palm pilot cover, Latvian mittens and seven others.<br />This isn't a book for novices but is a perfect book for the newly \\"hooked\\" knitter who wants to know more about the greater universe of this wonderful hobby. Even as a veteran, I learned more than enough to justify the cost of the book and will urge my local store owner to carry the book.	2002-02-05

In my recent review of &quot;Concourse,&quot; I bemoaned the lack of Lydia in the story.  The great news is that Lydia is definately back in place as the protagonist in this book.  Bill Smith is still around but only in a supporting role.  Why is this important?<br />First, the mystery itself returns to having Lydia's Chinese ancestry and life in Chinatown play a major plot in the book.  Concourse was just another Caucasian mystery in many ways.  It also sees the return of the lots of insights on life as a Chinese-American daughter and younger sister.  In sum, this book has much of the atmosphere and humor that I enjoyed so much in the first book, &quot;China Trade.&quot;<br />The mystery itself is only so-so.  Lydia's hired to deliever a blackmail payment for a clothes designer.  The list of possible suspects is pretty short and it wasn't hard to guess the ending.  Still, I enjoyed the characters and the setting so much that I didn't really mind.	2002-01-03

Many authors can't even overcome those obstacles in a way that flows.  The obstacles in this book are numerous.  Rosie is a victim of years of sexual abuse at the hands of her dead step-father and has responded by becoming an active alcoholic who dresses like a man and won't look in mirror.  She needs hand to reach her goal of making her farm pay (revenge on the step-father).  Her county has a law that a man can be saved from the gallows if he marries a woman from the county.  Enter Bowie - dishonorably discharged Army captain and convicted murderer.  He chooses marriage over death -- conveniently forgetting his wife in name only, Susan.<br />2/3's of the book is the story of Rosie and Bowie as he clears his name and guides Rosie out of her nightmare.  He's helps by some great side characters.  1/3 of the book is the story of Susan.  Bowie assumed she was safe in Washington DC.  It turns out that she's been disinherited and goes to Wyoming as a mail order bride only to be rejected because she has a son.<br />Many authors would have made a total wreck out of such a mass of complications.  Osborne works her way through with skill and tenderness.  It's not a perfect book.  Bowie's a bit too good to be true.  And it didn't move me to tears.  Still, it's a much better than average read.  And the critics agree with me.  The book was chosen by Romantic Times as one of the 200 best books of the last two decades.  Likewise, The Romance Reader's reader's poll chose it as one of the 100 best books in the history of romance novels.	2001-12-01

Lydia Chin, Chinese-American Manhattanite, was a fun new slueth. Her partner, Bill Smith, had a small role in the book which was filled with Chinese-American culture.<br />Concourse is an entirely different sort of book. It's narrated by Bill Smith and is almost entirely his adventure. Maybe it was the monotoned narrator on the Chivers audiotape but I found myself vacillating between neutral and negative when it came to Bill. He smokes way too much and just seemed pretty whiney. Lydia drops by once in awhile but there's hardly any of her charm or the interesting cultural aspects of the first book.<br />The mystery itself starts with the death of guard at a nursing home in the Bronx. Bill goes undercover as a guard and quickly finds lots of unanswered questions. The prime suspect in the crime, a gang leader named Snake, convinces Bill that someone else did the crime. Then there are more deaths and strange happenings around the nursing home. The solution is nicely complicated without being totally beyond belief.<br />According to my notes this book won a Shamus award and was chosen by the Independent Mystery Booksellers as one of the 100 best mysteries of the 20th Century. It didn't do all that much for me but it might be better reading in print (and for someone is isn't as opposed to smoking).	2001-11-29

Still, when my friend Lynn Gate's stocking was chosen to be the cover sock for this book, I had to check it out.  My conclusion - if you're a knitter with a need or a yen for Christmas stockings, this is a very inspirational tome.  There's tremendous variety in the stockings presented from a felted, hot colors stocking knit up in Noro to some delicate lace affairs.  All of the instructions are for stockings knit from the top down and most of the stockings have traditional gusseted heels.  Of course, the best part of knitting these gems is that you only have to knit one - no second sock syndrome.  <br />Bottom line - a good book for intermediate or better knitters who want to knit Christmas stocking with more complexity and pizazz than the free patterns on the internet.	2001-11-15

It could have been better but for one thing.  The publisher chose to quote a key piece of dialog in the fly-leaf.  Nothing usual about that except that it's from the end of the book and raised expectations that left me frustrated.<br />Most of the book is pretty much formula, well done but formula all the same.  Ugly/disfigured girl is given a new face, makes a great success of her life until....   I found her romance with Michael/Miguel, a Mexican-American, to be refreshing and well told.  Some of the other aspects of the book were painfully predictible.  Also, there were some minor editing gaffs - did Michael go to Harvard or Berkeley?<br />Still, I read the book in it's entirety in a single night.  So - very readable but not sure if it'll be very memorable.  All the same, someone out there liked it.  It was nominated for a RITA award for Best Contemporary Single Title.	2001-11-12

At age nine she ends up living in the streets and eventually earns desparately needed cash but using her amazing ability (magical?) to forge great works of art.  She escapes to the straight life when a visitor from the past threatens her into forging a painting owned by Adam.  Turns out the painting was painted by the twin and is of a glen in the fairytale world.  Adam had stubbled &quot;across&quot; as a child and knows the meaning of the picture.  It was in the book and so Brigit knows what it means. <br />The book revolves around the growing romanced between the two as they struggle with both evil humans and their own confusion about the meaning of the painting.<br />It's all pretty farfetched but the book is certainly a pleasant enough read.  Not a keeper for me though - no tears or belly laughs.	2001-11-11

It was written in 1931 which provides some charm.  Oh the thrill of a real electric ice box rather than having to meet the train for blocks of ice.  Mayo was literally hard for me to understand - his accent is incredibly thick.  Also, the narrator is a different person so we don't get much of a sense of what makes Mayo tick.<br />Bottom-line: Might be worth going out of your way to find if you are either 1)a big fan of early mysteries or 2) a fan of Cape Cod.  Otherwise, an ok read if it drops in you lap.	2001-11-11

Recently, I visited a true naturopathic doctor (there is a difference - about four years of medical school's worth) and had testing for food allergies.  Turns out several the highly recommended foods for my blood type are food that cause low-grade reactions (bloating, flatulence, lethargy)for me.  No wonder it didn't work.<br />Bottom-line:  Some good information on the body's ability to digest different things but still too much of a blanket approach given the individuality of each human being.	2001-11-09

The Kirkus review in the editorial section does a wonderful job of telling the key plot points so I won't be redundant.<br />I liked a number of things about this book.  Johnny/Jack Deal is a very appealing protagonist.  While I will always have a bit of a crush on Travis McGee, he isn't exactly a everyday sort of guy.  Deal is very much an everyman caught in a vortex of events that are beyond his control or understanding.  He responds with a nice mix of anger, humor and action.  The supporting cast is also well done - particularly Leon, the heavy for the bad guys.  He's strickly a character out of the Hiaasen school of Florida wackos.<br />I'll be reading the sequel to this book (Raw Deal) soon although I am a bit perplexed as to how Deal will continue to find himself involved in murder.  My father was a contractor and the most crime he ever saw was the periodic stealing of materials from a job site.  Still, if Jessica Fletcher could encounter a body a week, I'm sure Deal can too.	2001-11-05

Things quickly become complicated.  The victim has been rolling in the hay with many of the women at the farm.  The owner's granddaughter is missing.  Computer files quickly reveal double books.  And then someone starts attacking Fran as she investigates....<br />All told, I found this a mediocre read - despite it's have garnished a nomination for a Shamus Best Paperback.  The sense of place was so vague that I had to keep reminding myself where the book was set (rural New York and Pennsylvania).  There were so many characters that none of them had much depth.  And, well, I guess Fran Kirk with her history of spousal abuse simply wasn't a protagonist that I warmed up to very well.	2001-11-04

In Mystery Mile, Campion emerges as the clear star - abet a somewhat mysterious and charmingly quirky one.  I think I'm going to like Albert a great deal.  He's already showing a wicked sense of humor and irony.  He's clever but hardly perfect.  And there is a real sense of mystery about him - what is his real identity?  <br />This mystery is a solid example of a pre-Depression mystery with a family of swaggering Americans, a mysterious &quot;oriental&quot; (definately a pre-political correctness book), an English country house and a wonderful villian - Simister.  Albert meets the Americans on ship when he saves the father's life.  It turns out that it was the fifth attempt on the man's life - he's a judge who has a lead on Simister's identity.  The book revolves around Albert's efforts to both protect the judge and track down Simister.<br />Bottom-line: a very pleasant read with enough twists and turns to keep a reader interested.  The late 1920 atmosphere is particularly wonderful.	2001-11-02

Indeed, take away the silly cover and it probably could be placed in the literature shelf.  The book certainly includes the growth of a relationship but it is so much more complex than 99% of the romance market.  Indeed, it was a bit more of a challenge than I wanted at times (I read it while ill) but I'm glad I stuck with it.<br />The challenge lies mostly in the language of the book.  For many authors it would be enough to have a Quaker character with all of the &quot;thee/thou&quot; language.  Kinsale starts with not only the Quaker language but Maddy's struggle to be a Quaker falling in love outside of her faith.  THEN, Kinsale creates a most unusual hero - a regency rake who's a mathematical genius.  THEN, our hero has a stroke and we spend much of the book looking at (and hearing) the world through his impaired facilities.  Both his speech and his hearing are damaged and the reader has to guess at what he says and hears.  It can be done but it requires careful reading.<br />Bottom-line:  An unusual romance that is worth the extra effort - but it is important to go into this reading experience prepared for a different experience.	2001-10-30
US	48523769	R23E36ZDDIG3TL	0553293249	666241227	The Wild Island	Books	2	5	8	N	N	Pretty disappointing	I read the first Jemima Shore novel and found it pretty mediocre.  Still, they made a television series based on the books so I figured there must be something right about the series.  Having just finished the second book in the series, I'm baffled.<br />In The Wild Island, Jemima heads to a remote Scottish island for a quiet vacation.  When she gets there, her host is dead and his odd family is virtually at each other's throats.  Turns out the dead host thought he was the legitmate heir to Bonnie Prince Charlie.  More deaths follow.  Of course, things are sorted out in the end with Jemima in the middle of it - though I'm not sure if she made much of a difference.<br />Fundamentally, my problem with this series is that I just don't care for Jemima.  She isn't a warm character.  There is no humor and she takes herself very seriously.  I am particularly troubled by her habit of falling into bed with married men (not a bright idea even in these liberated times) and her total lack of remorse.  This make two men in two books.  I'm hardly a prude but this plot device leaves me cold.<br />Bottom-line:  There's probably a reason why this series faded into the sunset after six or seven books.	2001-10-29

All Night Long was a wonderful mix - a confirmation of the known and some nice new tidbits.  For example, I knew that dairy farmers can somehow work way too hard and still be really sexy.  What I didn't know was that Wisconsin had it's own episodes in the wars of the Frontier.<br />To avoid redundancy, I won't rehash the plot.  Suffice it to say that this novel is a most entertaining window into life with cows and could go along way to improving the image of male dairy farmers.  I found both characters to be appealing and accessible.  The side plot of searching for the truth about the dead soldier was fascinating.  About the only flaws in the book are the dreadful cover and the fact that this two have sex more often than I can imagine.	2001-10-29

I say that in the sense that this book puts forth most of the best elements that are found (more or less) in every book in this series.  <br />There is the sense of place.  In this case, the book lets the reader into the world of the lepers.  Set aside by humanity, the leper colony of St. Giles proves a multi-dimensional world with an integral role in the plot.<br />There is romance.  As in most of the books in this series, Cadfael lends a sympathetic ear to a smitten pair.  In this case, their obstacles are many and it's a fun read as things are unraveled.<br />And then there is Cadfael seeing what others miss.  It is Cadfael that notices a twig of a rare flower near the dead body.  Likewise, Cadfael sees some bruising on the body that could only be caused by a certain ring.  And more than once, Cadfael simply applies his experiences to discern what human nature is most likely to do.<br />My gripes with the book are worth a point off.  Foremost, the author seems to have forgotten rule number one of detection (surely as applicable then as now) - who would benefit financially from the death?  I also missed Hugh's presence.  And a most minor quandry -- were they really able to tell time to the point of distinguishing between 6:15 and 6:20 back then???<br />Bottom-line: a very solid and pleasant read for fans of historical mysteries.  Reading of earlier books in the series would be helpful but isn't necessary.	2001-10-27

Still, the slow pacing made me reluctant to read her second book.  Now I've read it - and it has almost the opposite problem.  I had no problem with inhaling it in an evening.  But when it was over I was left feeling unsatisfied.<br />Fundamentally, the flaw in this book is the huge use of coincidence.  Everywhere Tempe goes she runs into murder (the Jessica Fletcher syndrome).  OK, I can deal with that.  But that she happens to stumble onto murders in different countries that are related?  That her sister just happens to fall in the circle of the murderers?  Just too much for my pragmatic mind...<br />I like Tempe and her supporting cast.  I'm just hoping that this is only a case of second novel fails to follow the big debut and that the third novel will be a dandy.	2001-10-26
US	48523769	R2Y396OW2EKK83	0345312007	929665073	The Tree of Hands	Books	4	9	12	N	N	Masterful writing (if a bit bleak)	This book started out a bit of a &quot;duty&quot; read.  After all, how could I call myself a dedicated mystery reader having read only one Vine/Rendell.  This book won a Dagger which seemed reason enough to chose it over others by Rendell.  My recollection of my earlier read (as well as the reviews of her books in general) was that her stories tend to be a bit on the bleak side.  In many ways, &quot;The Tree of Hands&quot; is a dark and sad story.<br />Still, the bleakness of the story is a small price for the chance to read this intriguing tale of three lives that are at once spiraling out of control and towards each other.  Most interesting is the story of Benet.  When Benet's toddler son dies of illness, Benet's mentally ill mother brings home another boy of the same age.  Benet is aghast but doesn't want her mother (or herself) to be arrested for kidnapping.  Then she discovers the child has been abused.  At the same time, the boyfriend of the biological mother is falsely accused of the boy's murder and we watch his world unravel.  A third plot is added latter which is more tangentially related.<br />Rendell spins this tale in a way that captured even me, a reluctant reader.  In one sense it was a depressing read but at the same time I was captivated and eager to read another chapter.  &quot;The Tree of Hands&quot; is hardly a conventional murder mystery but it is an excellant example of pyschological suspense.	2001-10-25

It gets a humorous and warm treatment in &quot;Breathless&quot; where the women of a small Georgia town go on strike to shut down the town's main tourist attraction - a whorehouse.  The book focuses on the romance between Lily, leader of the women, and Daniel, lawyer for the owners of the brothel.  Their history is bad but when murder occurs they find themselves on the same side.<br />While there is a healthy dose of &quot;Americana&quot; in this book, I enjoyed the political edge - suffrage and women's rights.  Still, the best part of the book are the strong characterizations including several strong secondary characters.  The plotting is probably the weak point as the book lacked a strong page turning quality.  Still, a fun relaxing read even if it probably isn't a keeper.	2001-10-24

The good news is that she does theme well.  Isadora isn't flourishing in her setting.  The theme of the book is that the freedom of a new setting and the love of a good man can make a girl beautiful both inside and out.  Wigg's does it in an entertaining way.  Isodora liberation in the course of the sea voyage (complete with a charming cast of characters in the crew) and in 1850's Rio (by definition liberating?)makes for a fun read with lots of great images.<br />The romance is also very nicely paced with growing attraction and tension between the two -- leading to some pretty sexy scenes that are guaranteed to make the reader forget everyday life.<br />The critics agree.  The book was nominated for both a Reviewer's Choice and Francis awards.  It was also selected in a readers' poll as one the ten favorites of the year.	2001-10-19

On the whole, Night Work was worth the wait though it is far from perfect (or even the wonder of &quot;A Grave Talent&quot;).  <br />After the vague mystery of &quot;With Child&quot;, it is refreshing to return to the police procedural foundation and a healthy dose of Kate's police partner, Al.  I also got a kick out of the early crimes of the Ladies of Perpetual Disgruntalment.  The core of the murders reads well between the pure evidence and the abusive history of victims.  I particularly enjoyed the exploration of the marriage traditions of India when set in the US. The writing is good - if lacking a bit in the editing. <br />What didn't work for me in the book was the overwhelming sense of political correctness.  I'm fine with the lesbian relationships but King got both preachy and redundant in this story.  Likewise, this isn't the first time that she's explored religious themes.  However, at times this book reads more like a piece of feminist religious propaganda trapped in a mystery.  Sure, some of it figures into the plot but about 20% of the book seemed pretty irrelevant to either solving the crimes or growing the key characters.  Likewise, the ending is pretty abrupt without clearly exploring the motivations of the killers (and not very many clues leading up to their identification).<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a series that is critical to read in order.  This is the forth book in the series.	2001-10-19

So much of the romance I've been reading of late has been so mediocre that I figured a few chapters would be the sleeping tonic I needed.  Was I wrong.  I ended up staying up and reading the entire book.  <br />Winner of a Romantic Times' Reviewer's Choice Award, Stolen Hearts is a solid entry in the contemporary romance/jewel thief subcategory.  The editorial reviews capture the set-up well.  What I enjoyed was the gradual unraveling of the plan and the terrific twist at the end.  The characters are a bit two dimensional but not to the point of annoyance.  All told, a pleasant light read.	2001-10-17

My opinion is decidedly more ambivalent.  I basically found the book to be a grind to read with just enough redeeming features to keep me from giving up.  Which was good because the pages actually turned somewhat easily towards the end.<br />For those who know Boulder, the book is worth the time for no other reason that to read about the Boulder &quot;Trifecta&quot; - a bumper sticker contest in the law office.  It really captures the essence of Boulder.<br />For the rest of you, I'm hard pressed to encourage this book unless you're interested in either the militia movement or repressed memory issues.  Interest in (or at least tolerance for) a healthy does of lesbian politics wouldn't hurt either.  I don't know if it was the issues or the writing but this book was incredibly easy to put down.  Things warmed up in the final hundred pages but even then Wesson wimped out on the ending.  I'd much prefer a Stephen Walsh White mystery set in Boulder.	2001-10-10

After going through the reviews, there seems to be an unusual number of new readers who aren't bothered by a lack of background and many old readers who are bothered by a lack of new material.  I still enjoy getting reacquainted with the gang in each book but would agree that there isn't much progress in their lives in this book.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  However, it had much to do with the setting - Killdeer resort.  We spend lots of time in Summit County and it was great fun identifying the bits and pieces of the various resorts that Davidson borrowed to create her fictional resort.  For example, The Bistro restaurant is clearly based on one of my favorite restaurants in Keystone.  And, yes, all of the skiing is fun for a skier to read about.<br />The plot is probably more on the 3.5 star range.  As usual, DMD assembles a reasonably interesting half dozen new folks and drops enough clues that any one of them could be the bad guy.  I echo some of the other reviewers in our frustration with Goldy's underhanded investigative techniques and her inability to stop stupidly putting herself into peril. You'd think she'd learn to listen to Tom.	2001-10-05

It inspired me to go back to some of her earlier novels.  The good news is that Stabenow gets better with time.  The bad news is that some of the early stuff is pretty weak.  The basic problem with this book is that there isn't much mystery.  A man goes missing for ten months and no one reports it?  When found, his body is naked and he's died from mosquito bites.  He's the son of the local fundamentalist minister.  300 pages later we find out who killed him.<br />The basic problem with this book is that for every page that moves the plot forward, Stabenow includes ten essentially irrelevant pages.  The ramblings range from entertaining (does musak justify homicide?) to tedious (an encyclopedia excerpt on mushrooms) to touching (Kate's memories of going to college).  There's much discussion on religion and education.  These are two topics of interest to me so I didn't mind that they were mostly off topic.  Other readers may be justifiably less tolerant.<br />Bottom-line:  Many musings and not much mystery.  Stabenow can do(and has done)better.	2001-10-03

That's a hard act to follow and Smith sure tries.  Many of the good parts of the first book are still present -- Skip's wonderful observations of Southern manners first among them.  Got a killer holding a hostage outside?  The Police are meeting at your house for a strategy session.  Of course you serve coffee and cookies -- Cream anyone?<br />Unfortunately, the Edgar also seems to have given Smith the clout to ignore her editors and this book is easily 25% longer than necessary.  The fact that the killer must be among the 12 step crowd (Codependents Anonymous) and in the six assigned to Skip is determined early.  We then go through endless pages without moving the mystery forward.  <br />Bottom-line:  Still a nice sense of New Orleans but slow pacing make this an optional read.  Reading of New Orleans Mourning helpful but not required.	2001-10-03

Taking a solid but somewhat common plot, Smith adds a layer of observation and interpretation to make for a rich and thoughtfully paced suspense read.  For example, Smith spends what seems, at first, to be an inordinate amount of time describing the declining mill town of New Caxton, Rhode Island.  However, as the book progresses, many of the clues to the triple murder lie precisely in what is normal and what was abnormal in the minute details of everyday life in New Caxton.<br />Denise Burke, the narrator/true crime novelist, is very different from Nancy Prichard's new protagonist, Marie Lightfoot.  Denise is an interesting and rich personality - not just because she shoots the bull with Hilary Clinton.  The book is full of her inner thoughts which are processed in a most female style.  Male readers need to be prepared for some very &quot;Venus&quot; type thinking.<br />The book missing a fifth star for a couple of reasons.  First, the book starts with the murder of the Congressman, then spends 90% of the book in a relatively linear narrative of events preceeding the murder, and then has a brief post murder wrap-up.  Since the real mystery isn't the murder of the Congressman but rather the triple murder, why confuse the issue.  Also, while I enjoyed the asides about the Clintons, I think the marketers do the potential readers a disservice.  Bill and Hilary have nothing to do with the core of the story.<br />Bottom-line: A nicely written mystery that takes time to think and observe.  The pacing may be too slow for some readers.	2001-09-28

It's a solid (not stellar) book in the series.  As a native of the Bay Area, I enjoy her musings about the locale as much as the story and she goes some pretty interesting places in this episode.  Also, Don the DJ from Games to Keep the Dark Away is back so we have a little romance for Sharon.	2001-09-28

A Stephen King caliber author lives in Colorado as a virtual hermit.  He makes his thrice-yearly trip to the mailbox only to discover that all his business mail stopped four months earlier.  Then he hears that &quot;he&quot; is coming public and will be interviewed on television -- but it's clearly someone pretending to be him.  Then his house is blown up.  He goes to watch the imposter's interview and meets with his agent's assistant.  Instant sexual chemistry.  The bulk of the book involves John's slow convincing of Teryl of his story and then their efforts to thwart the imposter.  <br />Overall, I enjoyed this book.  It took a healthy dose of &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; at times.  The main characters are pretty appealing (though both are carrying unnecessary amounts of baggage).  The sexual chemistry is bubbling and the encounters are well written.  <br />Bottom-line: a better than average romantic suspense novel for an entertaining read.  &quot;Passion&quot; won a Romantic Time's Reviewer's Choice award for best romantic suspense.	2001-09-27

Perhaps because of this early date the book has both extra charm and some rough edges.  On the charm front, Poirot is still a developing character and I had the sense that Christie wasn't just delivering a formula character.  She also has the flexibility to place the plot in France which is largely a positive (even if all the &quot;M's&quot; get a bit confusing).  Hasting is still pretty unpolished.  Also some of the plot transitions are choppy.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It has many twists and turns.  Some of them are truely clever and a few are predictible.  The title is a tad misleadling.  While a body is found in the sandtrap of a golf course, golf has virtually nothing to do with the murder.  However, the reader needs to be alert as there are many &quot;links&quot; that will prove important as Poirot sees beyond the obvious to find the truth.	2001-09-26

Before they can honeymoon, Annie's assistant Ingrid is abducted and a dead man is found in her house.  The resulting search is so far fetched as to be a farce in many ways.<br />This isn't one of Hart's best books.  My primary peeve is that she forshadows the murderer early and often.  Also, for a book with the word &quot;Honeymoon&quot; in the title, there's very little romance.  I'm also getting really tired of the character of Posey.  Annie deserves a more worthy adversary.	2001-09-25

When a black attorney who has built a high profile practice sueing the LAPD on civil rights violations is found killed on the downtown funicular know as &quot;Angel's Flight&quot;, Bosch, Edgar and Ridder are called in.  In a city haunted by both the Rodney King riots and the OJ trial, the investigation proceeds on pins and needles. As Harry digs, he comes to suspect that the truth may lie in the case Elias was working on - the civil case stemming from the murder of an eleven year white girl from a powerful family.  It all gets nicely complicated.  Harry's also trying to quit smoking (finally!) and his marriage to Eleanor is on the rocks.<br />On the whole, I enjoyed this Bosch.  It was nice to have a book that didn't spend huge amounts of time in Las Vegas.  This book has plenty of juicy twists and turns without treading in the realm of obscurity.  It's still not as good as some of the early Bosch stories but well worth the time it took to read.	2001-09-17

Mostly it came down to failing to see much of a purpose for the book's existance.  Depressing and sad.  I sense from the other reviews that maybe this is a book that resonates more with male reader - I glad someone liked it.	2001-09-14

So if you're someone who knows your Holmes, you can ignore the rest of this review.<br />If your knowledge of Holmes is so-so (like me), you may find this book to be a mixed bag.  I found Irene and Penelope to be very interesting.  Unfortunately, the book covers several years and is pretty scattered.  (Of course, the fact that I've been reading this in the midst of the World Trade Center/Pentagon tragedy may speak to my mind being just as scattered.)  Still, I felt that there were whole chunks of the book that just went over my head.  Maybe Holmes fans will understand.	2001-09-13
US	48523769	R1RJ8SCCBDJQ7U	0786707542	20471690	The Black Dudley Murder	Books	4	5	6	N	N	More menace than a typical house party murder	Written in 1929, this book has to be one of the first house party murder stories.  I've read many and usually it's a bunch of nice, if eccentric, characters and not an obvious murderer in sight.  The Black Dudley Murder stands out because of the ongoing sense of menace due to the presence of a group of evil criminals at the house.  Determining the murderer and bringing him to justice is far less important for our hero, Abbershaw, than escaping from the master criminals holding the house party hostage.  What's worse is that Abbershaw has burned the papers that are the only ransom that will free the group.  <br />It's a fun read with a little more of an edge than many classic British mysteries.  This is my first Allingham and I was surprised by the minor role played by Campion.  I can only guess that Allingham decided to feature him after this book was written.  I'm looking forward to getting to know him better in later books.	2001-09-06
US	48523769	R367ROPWZ1G04V	0553712462	243328997	Flags of Our Fathers	Books	4	2	6	N	N	Powerful story; poor writing and balance	I've seen the picture and the statue.  I always thought that they raised the flag and the battle (if not the war) was over.  Perhaps the most powerful message of &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; was that the flag raising came at the beginning of the battle for Iwo Jima and that three of those six young men never left the island (let alone became fathers).  The book is well worth reading the get the straight story of the the photograph (not posed but also not the first flag raising that day) and the stories of each of the six men.  It's powerful stuff.<br />HOWEVER, I'm withholding one star (and considered two) because of two significant problems with the book.  The first is the writing and editing.  Many reviewers have complained about excessive redundancies in the book.  Well, I listened to the abridged tape and it still swims in redundancies.  You'd think after two editings....   Also, as the child of a member of the Army Corps of Engineers in the Pacific Front, I second the comments concerning Bradley's Marine bias.  The other services also played important roles in the Pacific theater.<br />Bottom-line:  Worth reading if you remember that this is primarily the story of one Marine and his five companions in a fluke moment when a picture was taken.  If this book can get a person born after 1970 to appreciate the sacrifices of WWII then it has served an important purpose.	2001-09-06
US	48523769	R3HMAX0COV9XDF	0445402296	320900982	The Murder of Richard III	Books	3	18	18	N	N	House party mystery farce	The house party mystery is a classic format.  Here, Peters takes the format and applies a liberal dose of history as the guests are a group dedicated to clearing the name of Richard III.  (Richard is the king whose image is that of the one who killed his nephews.)  And while this book is hardly a technical treatise on Richard's innocence, it is an entertaining pitch for that argument.  (Josephine Tey's &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; is a more convincing fictional argument - also a great read.)<br />As the guests wander around in costume and are generally being eccentric, accidents start to happen.  Most assume it is just a &quot;joker&quot; trying to disrupt the meeting but Jacqueline Kirby is suspicious.  It's a fun, light entertainment as she considers each of the guests as potential suspects -- and then saves the day.<br />Bottom-line:  This is the second in Peter's Kirby series.  Reading of the first book isn't necessary.  This book is a good (not great) read for fans of English history who can appreciate a cast of overblown characters.  Amelia Peabody fans may find the book too different for their tastes.	2001-09-05

I loved the movie but this book is, at best, so-so. Max carjacks Lora in Cancun and off to the jungle they go. He's a total jerk but somehow she can't resist his hunky body. Right... In the course of things we have rich drug lords, plane crashs, tropical jungle pools, creepy thugs,... All pretty stereotypical. Mostly though, the book simply asks the reader to believe that there is a chemistry between Lora and Max that I found hard to buy into. Too bad - I like romantic jungle pools.<br />Still, someone out there felt this book is a keeper.  It is listed on Romantic Times top 200 books since 1980.	2001-09-04
US	48523769	RV871RAMQWAFM	0671887971	176411000	Ring of Truth	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Couldn't put it down	Maybe it was just a good night to stay up with a page-turner. Ring of Truth, the second installment in Nancy Pickard's new series about true crime writer, Marie Lightfoot, kept me up well past bedtime the other night. It's not a perfect book - I'd give it 4 and 1/2 stars if the system allowed - but it's a good read.<br />Lightfoot continues writing about true crime in her home state of Florida (including a nice essay pondering why Florida spawns so many wierd criminals - shades of Carl Hiaasen). This case involves a liberal minister sentenced to death for killing his wife. Ironically, the minister is a leader in the anti-death penalty movement in the state and has be advocating the release of another condemned killer. Marie's book looks at both murders. She's sent it to her publisher but has nagging doubts that something isn't quite right. When new evidence turns up, Marie can't resist revisiting the case...<br />There are a number of things that set this book apart from the usual mystery fare. First, Pickard really knows how to write. Secondly, a true crime writing protagonist provides a great angle on crime. Marie, in theory, can talk with everyone involved. Even better, for the reader, is that Pickard alternates chapters between Marie's book and Pickard's narrative about Marie's ongoing investigation. It's a refreshing mix. Third, the conclusion is clever without coming completely from left field.<br />I'm still a bit ambivalent about Marie. In a genre stuffed to the gills with protagonists &quot;haunted by their pasts&quot;, it's a bit wierd to have a protagonist with virtually no past. This book has a bit more about life as a writer and Marie's love affair. But she still has no family or childhood. Definately different.<br />Bottom-line: A good page-turner. Reading of the first book &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; would be helpful but isn't imperative.	2001-08-31
US	48523769	R2EV0TWABGIUV8	0380725827	3388802	Firestorm (Anna Pigeon)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Much peril but not much park	Overall, this is good, exciting read. It's the fourth book in the Anna Pidgeon series and was nominated for an Anthony award. The plot focuses around a firefighting crew that is caught in a firestorm. (A tender topic here in Colorado where memories of the Storm King tragedy are still fresh.) When the crew emerges from their shelters, one member is dead with a knife in his chest. The same snow storm that caused the firestorm prevents rescue. Anna and her small group are stuck on a mountain with both the peril of killer weather and a murderer. The bulk of the book is a mix of survival and Anna trying to uncover each person's background and activities during the firestorm.<br />There's much to like in this book. The sense of danger and peril gives this book an edge that's been missing in earlier books. Anna's fledgling romance with Fredrick grows in a long distance manner. The firefighting crew is a most interesting and ecclectic bunch. The layers of possible motives are both interesting and plausible. <br />It misses a fifth star for a couple of reasons. First, there's almost nothing about Lassen Park in the book. One of the things I loved about the earlier books was the sense of the park Barr instilled in each book. This story could have taken place almost anywhere in the west that has a hot spring. Anna also does the fingercounting of possible suspects a few too many times. <br />Bottom-line: A solid exciting read that most will enjoy. Probably not the thing to take with you if you're going camping in a high fire risk area. Nor is it a book for people wanting insights for an upcoming trip to Lassen.	2001-08-30
US	48523769	R13YTOM8RNPPOX	0451191692	479197499	Remote Control (Alan Gregory)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Better the second time around	As a long time White fan, I read this book shortly after it was released. I raced through it and my overwhelming reaction was &quot;weird.&quot; I recently checked out the tape for my husband to read and decided to give the book a second chance. I suspect that the slower pacing of the tape forced me to pay attention to the many details that make this book make sense. The cyber part of the book is still pretty weird but now the mystery worked. <br />Alan Gregory's wife, Lauren Crowder, has center stage in this book. She's befriended Emma who has been blessed/cursed with Kennedy-like fame after the assassination of her father, the Surgeon General. Emma gets involved with a computer whiz and things start to turn ugly. The book is written in alternating chapters of present time and short-term flashback. In the present time, Lauren is standing outside of Emma's house during a blizzard. She fires her gun to warn off a stranger. The stranger is shot. Lauren is arrested -- and then goes into a medical emergency. Did Lauren shoot the stranger? What's going on in the first place? <br />This book is complicated. Alan and Lauren, who I normally love, are caught up in hiding too many secrets to be believed. Their refusal to confide in old friend, detective Sam Purdy, stretched their credibility considering all he's been through with them. Still, there are some truly page-turning moments and some good laughs along the way. The vision of the electric pink &quot;bunny&quot; on the snowplow is wonderful. <br />Bottom-line: This is definately NOT a book to read cold-turkey. Readers are strongly encouraged to have read at least two of the previous four Alan Gregory novels before attempting Remote Control. Then, my advice is to read this one slowly. It's not White's best work but can be a good read with the right approach.	2001-08-28

I ended up with a copy of &quot;E&quot; last week and decided to give it a reread.  Now I remember why I was excited about Kinsey Millhone.  <br />&quot;E&quot; is for Evidence has some great elements.  First, Kinsey is her own client - investigating why she's been framed for insurance fraud in a warehouse arson.  Without client confidentiality rules, Kinsey has so unusual elbow room.  Her search leads her into her past.  The warehouse was owned by the family of a high school friend and Kinsey plays the old school tie for all its worth.  To complicate matters, it's Christmas and her landlord and &quot;cook&quot; are both gone.  In this vulnerable moment, enter Kinsey's second ex-husband.  <br />Many of the other reviewers complain about the slow pacing in the first half of the book.  I didn't notice any problems -- and with books on tape, when it drags, it really drags.  The plot certainly has high energy by the conclusion.  There are plenty of twists and turns.  The conclusion is all I ask of a mystery - more or less unpredictible but with just enough clues planted along the way that the solution doesn't come from left field.	2001-08-15
US	48523769	R245HMI9B9B59S	006100345X	665415995	The Ghostway	Books	4	14	15	N	N	Eloquent narrative outweighs slow plot	Tony Hillerman's book are often marketed as quick paperback reads.  Sure they are mysteries at heart but they are more than mysteries.  Hillerman asks the reader to think. <br />In this book, Hillerman is pondering heavy questions.  The first underlying theme is whether Chee should leave the reservation for a job with the FBI.  Since Chee does lots of driving in the book, we share many hours of internal debate on the issue.  The second and more subtle theme involves aging and wisdom.  While the core of the mystery involves middle-aged folks, many of the most valuable witnesses are very elderly.  They are the people many investigators would ignore.  I found the Chee's interviews with the seniors to be top flight writing.<br />The actual plot is ok.  Chee has to spend more time in Los Angeles that I enjoyed.  Still, city life for Native Americans is a reality.  There were a couple of annoying redundancies as certain plot points were revisited.  The survivalist bad guy was pretty over the top and his excesses were quite unnecessary.  <br />Bottom-line:  Not my favorite Hillerman but not a waste of time by any definition.  For those who like to read their books in order, this is number six in the greater Chee/Leaphorn series.	2001-08-15

It's my first read in the series and I expect I'll read a few more -- Miss Silver is a knitter after all.<br />This story revolves around an 18 year old girl who may or may not be an heiress. In the meanwhile, a conspiracy appears to exist that threatens the girl's safety. Most of the book focuses on the girl and some acquaintances who take it upon themselves to protect her. One of the friends hires Miss Silver but her appearences are infrequent.<br />Bottom-line: A good 1920's English mystery for those who are fond of Christie and others. I'm hoping for more Miss Silver in other books.	2001-08-14
US	48523769	R3TO6ZKCWJFPTN	042517946X	573290210	Death on a Silver Tray (Beau Brummell Mysteries)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Won Agatha for best first novel	The mystery genre tends to be focused in the present.  The sub-group of historical mysteries is growing and its always nice to have another series.  The most distict thing about this novel is its setting - London during the early 19th century, a period know as the Regency.  Romance readers are probably more than familiar with the decadence of the era but based on the other reviews, it is a breath of fresh air for mystery readers.  Having read more than a few romances about the era, it's not so new for me.  Also, Stevens' presents a group of people who value things that I have a hard time relating to on a personal basis.  So, the setting doesn't do much for me.<br />It also took me a while to warm up to our slueth, George &quot;Beau&quot; Brummel.  Based on the real person who was the leader of fashion at the time, Stevens has found an unusual slueth.  He spends hours on his wardrobe, worries excessively about what people will think about anything he does or wears or says.  Modest he is not.  Does he work as a slueth?  Maybe.  I just didn't like him very much, particularly at first.<br />The actual mystery - who killed the cranky widow - is pretty plain vanilla stuff.  The killer makes sense in the end but the clues are few and far between.  Many of the clues are dropped by the cat in a manner that is straight out Braun's &quot;The Cat Who...&quot; series.<br />Bottom-line:  Thumbs up to Stevens for trying something different in the mystery genre.  Readers may or may not take to Beau. Still, the book is certainly a pleasant enough read for readers to see if they like him for themselves.	2001-08-10

I also learned some interesting trivia about the campaign world.  But beyond that it's a pretty flat read, particularly for Stuart Woods.  While Woods isn't likely to win a Pulitzer prize ever, his books are generally both high energy and original.  This book is neither.<br />The book is full of cliches.  Will Lee reminds me much too much of Robert Redford in &quot;The Candidate.&quot;  The right wing stalker has been done over and over lately.  The plotting is painfully predictible -- every crisis point has a happy ending.  Even the dialogue is predictible.  Do we really need to listen to the standard flight attendent speech in its entirety?<br />Bottom-line:  Not one of Woods' better efforts and there are better political thrillers out there.  Still, if it's the only thing available at the airport, it'll entertain you for a few hours.	2001-08-09

Still, it took me almost a week to work through this book when I usually inhale a Cadfael in a day or two.  Much of the problem was in the pacing.  The book starts out slowly and then only has energy in fits and starts throughout.  The other part is that Cadfael's role is unclear.  The book has nothing to do with his herbal and medical skills.  He actually seems to be meddling in a very civil matter.  It also would have been nice to have more of the political elements.  Oh well -- I still looking forward to reading the next book in the series (The Leper of St. Giles).	2001-08-02

Dams first book in this series, &quot;The Body in the Transept&quot; won the Agatha for best first novel.  This book, the second in the series is a solid follow-up.  (Reading of the first book is nice but isn't necessary.)<br />The book starts with the discovery of the body of a young stranger in the deserted town hall.  Our heroine, retired teacher/American living in England - Dorothy Martin - just &quot;happens&quot; to be in on the discovery of the body.  From there on, her sense of justice and curiosity won't rest until the killer is found.  The town hall is in the middle of a tempest about it's future.  Was the murder related to the feud between the preservationists and the developers?  As Dorothy digs further, there are some other ties between the suspects that may matter....  The solution comes together nicely - not the obvious guess but not a total surprise either.<br />Half the fun of the book is seeing English village life through Dorothy's adoring American eyes.  Leaky roof problems are annoying but also part of the &quot;experience.&quot;  Roundabouts on the highway are a menace.  I also find myself liking Dorothy even if she is a terrible snoop.  I'm particularly fond of her growing relationship with Alan Nesbitt, the chief constable.  We don't get much &quot;senior&quot; romance in books and it's about time.	2001-07-31

The Independent Mystery Booksellers chose this book as one of the 100 best mysteries of the 20th century.  It is, however, a most unusual mystery.  The dead bodies weren't murdered.  Nothing was stolen by thieves.  <br />But there is a puzzle to be solved.  Lori (an American) &quot;inherits&quot; a project.  She is charged with reading through a half century of correspondence between her mother and Dimity.  When Lori and Dimity's lawyer (Bill) arrive at Dimity's English cottage it quickly becomes apparent that Dimity is haunting the place. Dimity is a most friendly ghost caught in a purgatory of sorts.  The puzzle is to figure out why she's in purgatory and then to fix the problem.  This challenge sends Lori and Bill all over Great Britain to find answers and romance.<br />I enjoyed this book.  It is almost painfully sweet at times.  Somehow the song &quot;Don't worry, be happy&quot; kept crossing my mind.  Still, a series that I'll continue to read - it's a great antidote to a batch of hard boiled PI stories.	2001-07-27

She's general manager for the island's radio station, participates in the local effort to help nesting turtles and has a nice guy in life.  Then things start to go wrong.  She inherits the chairmanship of the local parade committee.  Her boyfriend goes skiing and never comes back.  Then the most obnoxious member of her committee, a recent arrival and know-it-all, is found murdered on the turtle's nesting beach.  Kelly isn't planning to investigate a murder but curiosity gets the best of her.<br />While this is not classic literature, it is a fun and light departure for the genre.  It even managed nominations for best first novel from both the Agatha and MacCavity folks. It also garnished an Anthony best paperback nomination.  I enjoyed the setting which Grilley uses well with only a couple of boring tourist lectures.  She gives us &quot;continentals&quot; a vicarous insight into really living on an island.  The plot is so-so at best with too few real contenders for the killer (tho the reason for the killing is pretty clever).<br />Bottom-line: a tropical cozy for your beach or poolside reading OR save it for a snowstorm when you need a mental vacation.	2001-07-26

I thought I'd check out the series from the beginning.  It may be a long time before I get to the books that won the awards.<br />Knots &amp; Crosses is a competently written police procedural set in Scotland.  It was, at least for me, a bit of chore to read.  The bleakness was the difficulty.  A nasty child murderer is sought.  Rebus is a bit too stereotypical - divorced, alienated, chain smoking loner with a past that the reader has to guess about.  With the exception of some tourist info (meaningless to me, having never been there), there just is no relief for the reader.  While everything is resolved in the end, the reader doesn't get many clues to chew on in the process of the novel.<br />Bottom-line:  I'd give this two and a half stars if the system allowed.  Fans of British police procedurals may like this better but I'd rather read Daziel &amp; Pascoe or Inspector Barnaby.	2001-07-26

Most of them have been well written stories but rarely page turners.  I picked Mrs. Pollifax up at the library the other day because the tape was there (and the tapes on my list were all checked out).  Was I ever surprised.  This was a really fun and entertaining read.<br />The jist of the story is that your grandmother joins the CIA in the 1960's.  I had two grandmothers of Mrs. Pollifax's age and the imagery is wonderful.  There are plenty of plot summaries elsewhere in this page.  Suffice it to say that even after 35 years, this is a good book.  Sure, it's a bit dated but if you think of it as a historical mystery you'll do just fine.  There is plenty of witty banter and humor.  Some of the plotting and action is a bit stereotypical but done with just the right amount of parody.<br />Bottom-line:  An oldie but a goodie.  A cozy with international intrigue and humor.  I'll be reading the next book (The Amazing Mrs. Pollifax) soon.	2001-07-25

It's all an undercover job to try to locate the missing star.  But when blood turns up in the player's home, things get complicated.<br />Complicated is a good word to describe this, the third book of the Myron Bolitar series.  The first half of the book moves along pretty cleanly.  The second half brings in numerous complications and red herrings -- maybe more than was absolutely necessary.  And the ending, in classic Coben style, is strictly out of left field (although, as usual, it makes sense in hindsight).<br />Critical acclaim for the book includes awards for best paperback of the year from both the Edgar and Shamus folks.  It was also nominated for the Anthony and Dilys book for the year.  But the reason I like this series is the wit and humor.  Myron and Win belong to my late boomer generation and I love the references to that culture.  The wisecracking and the inuendos are also lots of fun.  And, what can I say, I'm a woman who likes sports.  It's nice to read a combination of mystery and sports.	2001-07-25

While it lacks the polish and originality of her later efforts, I found it an enjoyable read.  <br />Elizabeth is a new college graduate, clueless as to her future.  She's drafted to be the bridesmaid for her cousin who attended a mental hospital for her &quot;finishing school.&quot;  Much of the book is devoted to the eccentricities of the Chandler family - a cousin who lives at the physicist's commune, an overbearing aunt and the cousin who built his home in the style of Neuswanstein (spelling?) - the Disneyland castle.  It takes half the book for the murder to occur.  The local cops are terrific characters.  The solution is a bit improbable but I still enjoyed to book overall.	2001-07-24

While it is hardly a great novel, the book did a solid job of making the miles go by.  It had enough complexity and red herrings that our meal breaks were filled with friendly debate on who each of us thought was the &quot;real&quot; killer.  There also was plenty of humor - the &quot;leopard skin butt flosser&quot; will be an inside code for a good laugh for years.<br />There's also some pathos in the novel.  The insider's view of the manipulation of the bestseller's list and, more generally, the popular reading offerings is saddening.  The &quot;maleness&quot; of the small elite francise authors list is fundamental to the plot of the book.  Likewise, Abby's need to escape from her publishing past.  This compenent is a message that elevates this book from being a simple commercial thriller.<br />The book isn't perfect.  Abby seems to forget much of her legal training at critical times.  Also, the final 10% of the book dragged on far to long after the resolution of the plot.  Still, it's a perfectly fine book for passing the time (and the miles) on a hot summer day.	2001-07-23

Rostnikov is in the doghouse after his adventures of the first two novels in this series.  He has a new boss who is, of course, a jerk.  The powers that be have claimed his assistants for fairly glamourous cases: Karpo is seeking a weeping sniper and Sascha is trying to locate a car theft ring.  Rostnikov is left with the &quot;dregs&quot; - the murder of an 84 year old Jewish man.  The only clues -- one of the killers resembles a face in a 60 year old photo from the victim's youth and the killer took a brass candlestick.<br />Karpo and the sniper is an interesting story with a good ending.  Rostnikov gets into the action on the car theft ring - a story that ends with high drama (Kaminsky's screenwriter past comes through). And then, the case of the murder is closed without a solution.  Rostnikov, never one to leave things undone, keeps looking in the killing only to unveil a most interesting tale.<br />Overall, a solid third installment in the series.  New readers are encouraged (strongly) to go back to the beginning (Death of a Dissident) as the evolution of the main characters is as much a part of the reading experience as is the solving of the crimes.  And why read this series rather that the others?  Half of what I like is simply the Moscow setting and learning about everyday life in 1980's Russia.  The other half is that the main characters are really growing on me - Rostikov with his grit and intelligence; Karpo the stoic; and Sascha just trying to juggle his wife and mother.	2001-07-20

Anglophiles will throughly enjoy the details of college life in Cambridge.  George does a wonderful job of capturing the little inner worlds of the colleges and the role of the Cam in the life of the city (if my memories of a semester there in the 1970's hold true).  It's also a darn good mystery with a new prime suspect every fifty or so pages.  The ending is a bit like a gourmet dinner - tricking to taste the complexity, a tad difficult to digest but ultimately satisfying.<br />The subthemes of the book are equally interesting.  Much of the book has to do with well-meaning, loving people trying to meet the expectations of those they love.  Elena, the victim, is deaf with parents who have spent twenty years trying to make her as &quot;normal&quot; as possible.  But what is normal for a deaf person?  Much (too much) of the book dwells on Havers internal battle over whether she should send her Alzheimer's inflicted mother to a small care facility.  <br />I've withheld a fifth star because of my unresolved confusion about Lynley's relationship with Lady Helen.  I really enjoy this series but sometimes the publication order and the actual timeline are confusing.  In this book, all of a sudden and out of the blue (for me) Lynley is ardently persuing Lady Helen.  There are references the &quot;past nine months&quot; but I felt like I'd missed something.  Quite frankly, I'm not surprised by Helen's reluctance to get involved if the building blocks of the relationship of are as vague to her as they were for me.<br />Bottom-line:  A strong and interesting mystery that should satsify old and new readers alike.  New readers are encouraged to start at the beginning of the series to better understand the personal side of the players.	2001-07-20

In addition to dealing with Max's mother's increasingly bizarre suggestions for the wedding, they're acting in the summer rep production of Arsenic and Old Lace.  The sluething starts with page one as the play is plagued by numerous pranks and mischief.  In addition, there are problems with the &quot;star&quot; of the play - an aging surfer movie star who is chasing everything female on the island.  Things turn serious about half way through the book when surfer boy turns up dead.  The prosecutor sets his sights on Max as prime suspect and Annie is on the case.  The ending is a bit of a curve ball but it worked for me.<br />This was a good, but not great, read.  The high school Thespian in my past enjoyed all the theater stuff.  I found the prosecutor, Posey, so overblown as to be uncredible.  Indeed, most of the new characters seemed rather two dimensional.  I continue to enjoy Annie and Henny's references to fictional characters but some of the references were really obscure.  The pacing is pretty solid as Annie is one the case virtually every waking hour.<br />Bottom-line:  Not quite sure why this won an Agatha but a good read.   Readers new to the Death on Demand series are encouraged to start at the beginning -- &quot;Death on Demand.&quot;	2001-07-18
US	48523769	R3LCM5C486CDHN	0345374266	646585022	Shadows in Bronze	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Falco returns in fine form	Take the sardonic wit of Spenser or Stephanie Plum and transport it back to 70 A.D. and you have Falco.  There are three things to enjoy in this book (and series) and this book is well done on all three.<br />First, there's the mystery.  A murder in Rome comes with hints of a possible consipiracy against new ruler (and Falco's employer) Vespasian.  Falco is sent first south and then west to locate the dead man's brother and another potential suspect.  A mysterious freedman, Barnabas, (half-brother of Helena's dead ex-husband) keeps turning up with deadly results.  The bulk of the action takes place in the bay of Neapolis (see maps in the back of the book) and is a nice of mix of political intrigue, personal ambition ....<br />Second, is the wonderful humor.  Falco is a genuine wisecracking guy and often brings a smile to your lips.  Davis also has a knack for taking an aspect of modern life and transporting in back in time.  The section on the risks of buying a used chariot is a gem.<br />Finally, there's the romance.  Falco is still WAY too poor to persue Helena but she keeps turning up.  What's a guy to do but make the lady happy?  Things aren't totally resolved by the end of the story but the relationship definately progresses.<br />Bottom-line:  Don't take this wrong but a series that is sort like a Flintstones for grown-ups.  Modern day human foiables are cast in Roman times with the most interesting and entertaining results.  Keeping track of the names is a challenge (there's a list in the book) but worth it.   Reading of \\"Silver Pigs\\" first is encouraged but not essential.	2001-07-18

I would have enjoyed it a great deal more if the family trees had been placed in the front of the book rather than in the appendix (since I was a good girl and didn't skip ahead to the end).  Considering there is a whole story devoted to a postcard mailed to &quot;Anna&quot; where the intended receipient could have be half of the village, keeping track of the names is tricky.  The family trees are really helpful - if you know they are there.<br />Otherwise, the format of the book makes for good reading.  The book is a series of episodes in the lives of the women in three families.  They aren't quite short stories since characters and plot lines reappear every so often.  At the same time, the stories are distinct enough that I was able to put the book down between chapters.<br />Bottom-line:  A pleasant read with the chance to armchair travel into life in a small Austrian village.  Our book group liked the book a great deal although it didn't stimulate an extensive discussion.	2001-07-16

It won an Agatha so you're exepecting lots of sluething.  Think again.  The mystery component is, at best, about one-fourth of the book.  And then, just to be really annoying, Maron never really tells you why or how the killer killed.  Normally this would totally sour me on the book but I enjoyed the other three-fourths of the book enough to forgive her.<br />What this book (and series) is really about is life in contemporary rural North Carolina as seen through the eyes of Deborah Knott.  Deborah (don't even think of calling her Deb or Debbie) is the youngest of twelve children (you need a scorecard to keep the brothers straight) and is a district court judge.  Between family and litigants, the book is filled with tales of small town life - paternity suit shananigans, stock car racing history, feuds over old family burial plots, and church goers who will gamble on any day but Sunday.  Hunters wives (like me) will laugh out loud over the &quot;buck fever&quot; story towards the end of the book.<br />This particular book dwells on the effect of growth on the community.  Land prices are skyrocketing and tract homes are replacing fields.  When an elderly landowner (and former stock car builder) is killed without direct descendents, the possible heirs are all looking to grab his land and make a killing.  But did they kill to make a killing?  One of the possible heirs is Deborah's ex-husband from a annulled marriage - just to make things interesting.<br />Bottom-line:  A good book for people who want to read a book in a southern setting that finds the middle ground between the angst of literary fiction and the buffoons of Jeff Foxworthy.  Folks who need non-stop mystery action may want to look elsewhere.	2001-07-15

In fact, they were so positive that I actually put off reading the sequel because I feared it wouldn't live up to the original.  Alas, I fear I was correct.<br />This is the third King book I've read (To Play the Fool and A Darker Place being the others) that deals with a religious cult.  I think the books were all written around the same time and religion must have been all but an obsession for King.  Unfortunately it makes for pretty uninteresting reading for me personally.  So, in this book I skimmed many pages and found that I really didn't care much about what was happening the Childe's regiment of &quot;suffragettes/cultists.&quot;<br />While there isn't much Holmes in this book, what is provided is plenty interesting.  I'm probably somewhere in the middle on the controversy concerning the romance between Holmes and Mary.  Yes, the age difference is troublesome.  Still, they are both such unusual people that why should they be usual in who they love.<br />Bottom-line:  Uninteresting plot/mystery dulls the enjoyment of reading about Mary's attaining her majority (and her fortune) and the maturation of her relationship with Holmes.	2001-07-14
US	48523769	R1JBP5ZS7J7RCL	0806963174	592097002	Big Book of Knitting	Books	4	47	47	N	N	Solid alternative in the basic reference knitting book arena	The list of basic reference books for knitters is pretty short.  I've owned and used Vogue Knitting for years.  Montese Stanley's book never quite worked for me.  And, sure, I'd love a copy of Hiatt's Principles of Knitting (but not at the three figure prices asked on e-bay).  So it's good that Katharina Buss has added a solid alternative in this category.  It's even better that it's now out in trade paperback for those on a budget (or trying to justify buying another basic reference book).<br />First, let me join the other reviewers in saying that this is NOT a book for novices or beginners.  There are some pages that are applicable but most of the information is complicated enough to create a risk of scaring a new knitter away from knitting forever.  This is a very good book for knitters who are ready to add polish to their knitting or want to alter existing patterns.  Even this thirty year knitter found some new tricks in this book.<br />Thumbing through the book, here are some highlights (and things I don't recall being in my copy of Vogue Knitting): 1. A list of cleaning symbols and other good tips on caring for finished garments. 2. A detailed section on edges and hems - now that styles allow for looks other than plain ribbing. 3. Several alternatives for facing - definately for the experts but facings create a great look. 4. Fifteen pages on necklines - great for the knitter with a pattern with an ugly neckline. 5. A section on putting in zippers. 6. Sections on shaker stitch, intarsia, and entrelac. 7. A big section on short rows. 8. A section on embossed ribs (think Coogi sweaters).<br />Bottom-line:  I'll certainly get my money's worth out of this book over time.  Vogue Knitting will probably stay my primary reference just because it's such an old friend.  This book was originally written in German and the main complaint I've heard about it is that some of the written instructions suffer in the translation.	2001-07-13

I strongly urge anyone considering reading these books to try to read them in order also.  Quite simply, half of the fun of this series is following Goldy, Tom, Arch, Julian, Marla and the rest of the gang as their lives evolve.  Sure, DMD provides sketchy background fillers, but it really helps to know what has happened in the past to understand the present in this book.<br />That being said, this is a good read.  The book is broken up into more or less equal parts of Goldy's home life (Tom's suspended and decides to remodel the kitchen, Julian's back and Marla's being audited, and Arch is talking about finding a girlfriend); trying to salvage her business against a ruthless new competitor; and poking her nose into the murders of (1)the contractor who trashed her kitchen and, then, (2) her cooking mentor.  Lots of the action takes place in an old homesteader's cabin - the site of a catalog modeling shoot which was also the site of the murders.  Goldy is feeding the models and starts to wonder.  <br />As a Colorado resident, I continue to enjoy this series.  DMD does a nice job in this book of working a little bit of local history into modern day life in Colorado.  Skimpy models wearing lingerie in a homesteader's cabin in the mountains.  Just thinking about it....	2001-07-12

The book has over a thousand recipes culled from thirteen years of the magazine. That's a pretty nice place to start. Then, unlike the annual books, this is an organized book so all of the desserts are together and such. <br />But why buy this instead of &quot;Five Star Recipes&quot; (the &quot;best of&quot; book released a couple of years ago)? For starters, this book has at least five times as many recipes. Also, FSR is mostly pretty fancy stuff - great for entertaining but more complicated than most of us want for every day. This book has enough room for both the showy and everyday standards. For example, it has about six versions of meatloaf alone.<br />But the part I wasn't expecting and found most wonderful are all of the sidebars filled with wisdom on the basics. For example, there's a nice section on tricks for boiling eggs that teaches you how to avoid getting the green rim around the yoke.<br />Bottom-line: This is a winning cookbook. Veteran cooks will find good recipes and still learn new tricks. I'm also thinking that it has great potential as a bridal shower/college graduation gift.	2001-07-12

This book made it to my reading list based on two major endorsements - Romantic Times awarded it a Reader's Choice award and then included it in their 200 best since 1980.  In many ways it is very deserving for this is hardly run of the mill fare.  <br />Just in the early pages, we have Cassidy's writer father all but sacrificing her to the convicted murderer, Richard Tiernan, in exchange for an exclusive on Tiernan's memoir.  Tiernan is an unusual hero - to say the least.  Not a confessed murderer but yet one who won't persue a strong defense of his case.   And then there are the missing children....   <br />The sexual tension in this book is intense (almost to the point of being hard to believe) and the sex scene are heated and detailed.  The end has some good twists and turns - but you'll need to read the book.	2001-07-11

The dynamic changes a bit in this book.  Hester has the leading role as she is the link to the family of both the victim and the accused.  Likewise, since the arrest happens early in the book, much of the book focuses on the formation of a legal defense resulting in a much bigger role for Rathbourne.  Monk isn't forgotten but his role is secondary.  (Indeed, the handful of times where he explores his forgotten past are almost awkward interruptions in the flow of the book.)  I liked this use of the three characters -- probably because I like Hester a great deal.  She's feisty and smart.<br />The overall reading experience is a mixed bag.  After an adequate start, the book really bogs down in the middle section.  Some good editing would have trimmed about 30 pages.  Fortunately, the final hundred pages are dandy -- more than making up for the tedium of the earlier parts of the book.  It was also interesting to read a book that was focused on the motive for the crime rather than determining and locating the criminal.<br />As seems to be the case in all the Perry books I've read so far, the plot is focused on getting behind the facade of respectable upper class Victorian families.  Who else would have the money to hire our heroes?  I enjoy the upstairs/downstairs insights as well as the historical social commentary.<br />Bottom-line:  I liked this Agatha nominated book.  First time readers are strongly encouraged to read this series in order (starting with The Face of a Stranger).	2001-07-03

What really struck me about this book (perhaps because I listened to the unabridged tape) was how so much of the plot turned on what happens when a writer is less than precise with language.  Mortimer does a masterful job of creating Felix, a writer who doesn't even realize that his misstatements are misstatements or the trouble those statements cause.<br />Overall, it took me a while to warm up to the book but by the end I was rooting hard for the truth to emerge.  The actual ending was a little corny but ok.  It's a book filled with a fun assortment of characters.  More than a few humorous jabs are made at the modern publishing world and modern society in general.  Not a laugh out loud book but one that made me chuckle to myself.<br />A New York Times notable mystery in 1997 - for those who are fond of books with credentials.	2001-07-03

I've recommended Murder on the Iditarod Trail and Sleeping Lady to many people.  I won't be recommending this book.  <br />With Deadfall, it felt as if Henry was struggling to find a plot and/or meet a deadline.  The first half of the book was very ponderously plotted.  The pace picks up in the second half.  The good news is that it's really hard to guess who the stalker is.  (One thing I like about this series is that the &quot;bad guy&quot; is often the last person you'd suspect.)  The bad news is that the logic behind the stalker is pretty far fetched -- and if you missed the clue in the early pages, it isn't repeated as they unwind the story at the end.<br />I'm also enough of a romantic that I'm growing a little impatient with Jesse's ambivalence about making a commitment with Alex.  Jesse's &quot;I'm an independent woman&quot; attitude just doesn't quite work for me -- particularly when she's just relied on a group of men to help her.  He's a good guy Jesse -- wake up!<br />Finally, I listened to the unabridged audiotape of the this book which may have lessened my enjoyment of this tale.  The narrator (Peiffer) speaks with only a little more emotion than a monotone.  Dialogue, in particular, comes across in a painfully stilted voice.  This may be a better series to read in printed text.	2001-06-30

That's the basic premise of this &quot;marriage comes first, revelations come second and love comes later&quot; romance.  I'm sure it's hard to come up with original ideas in a genre with so many existing plots.  Still, this one stretched my ability to suspend disbelief.  Her family would let her get married looking like a hag rather than risk disgrace?  Austyn, a pretty smart guy, couldn't tell she was costumed?  Yea, right....<br />I read this because it was the winner of Romantic Time's Reviewer Choice Award in the Love and Laughter category in 1995.  It's my first Mederios novel.  Overall, it was a pleasant enough read but nothing exceptional.  Nothing made me laugh out loud but there were a few scenes that brought a smile to my face.	2001-06-30

As a book club book it was pretty successful.  We didn't talk all that much about the book itself but the book prompting some wonderful discussion about food and memories and the like.  <br />For the reader without a discussion to look forward to, I'd be reluctant to recommend the book.  Something is missing for me about this read.  I've given it three stars because the actual writing (particularly some of the food descriptions) is quite strong.  But the content is lacking.  I'm all for memoirs of interesting people but I really learned far more about Moore's relatively ordinary life than I ever wanted to know.  Then, just to confuse things, are some pretty random essays about food totally outside of the context of the memoir.  It just doesn't work for what I want out of a read in this type of a book.	2001-06-29

Cop, PI, amateur - what did it matter?  Several hundred mysteries later, I've come to appreciate that each player in a mystery has access to different information not to mention having differenct perspectives and agendas.  I've also read true crime.  But never before have I read fiction written from the perspective of a true crime writer.  It really is a great idea.  First, true crime writers are only going to write about pretty sensational crimes.  Even better, Marie has access to virtually all the players and a legitimate reason for talking with them.  And for the reader, there's the interesting format where Pickard switches from excerpts of the book within the book (written in true crime style) to the personal narrative of Marie as the post trial search for the truth reveals itself.<br />For a summary of the plot of this book, I refer you to the excellent editorial review by Amazon editor Flynn.  Pickard works the Florida setting well.  This book worked great as a page turner though I agree with other reviewers that the ending is just a little to tidy and easy for the author.<br />Suffice it to say that Pickard has launched a series with great potential.  I agree with other reviewers that the book is a bit skimpy on details about Marie Lightfoot -- but it only whets my appetite to learn more in future books.  And since true crime happens everywhere, Pickard should be able to justify lots of travel expenses as she &quot;researches&quot; settings.<br />For fans of the the Jenny Cain series, this is a very different type of book.  While hardly a &quot;hard-boiled&quot; gorey affair, it isn't a cozy either.  It is a good summer read for fans of both genres.	2001-06-29

It's not often that a genre fiction hero is a source of quotes.  But it is the philosophical aspect of McGee that keeps this series from being a totally dated antiquity.  Travis loves women.  Travis is a chauvanist, but a thoughtful one.  This is only my second McGee novel (trying to read them in order) but I find myself most entertained by his musings on women, loyalty to friends, work and - in this book - the role of New York in the downfall of humanity.<br />The plot is described only too well in other reviews.  Suffice it to say that most of the action takes place in the third quarter of the book with a medical scenario that would make Robin Cook proud.  It's all a bit far-fetched but the pages turn easily enough.  I'd give it 3 and 1/2 stars overall if the system allowed.	2001-06-28
US	48523769	RAWRGCPHQTGY7	0345370759	424518078	All the Great Pretenders	Books	2	6	7	N	N	Agatha nominee left me flat	After being pretty impressed with recent Agatha first book nominees, I've been venturing back into some of the older nominees.  This book, a nominee in 1991, wasn't very impressive.  The story is set in a B&amp;B in a small town in Tennessee.  Far too much of the book is about the B&amp;B and small town life.  Such mystery as there is only gets rolling in the second half of the book.  It seemed to me that the author's real agenda was to write about life in her town and the mystery was an afterthought.<br />Bottom-line: Not sure what this book did to earn a nomination and not surprised the series hasn't gone on to further critical acclaim.  There's better southern small town mystery out there (Margaret Maron, Carolyn Hart and others).	2001-06-27

What I enjoy most about the entire series is the fact that it has elements of three genres - romance, mystery and science fiction.  Does it do any of them perfectly?  No.  Is is refreshing to read something that isn't strictly formula?  Yes.  Could a first time writer get a publisher for something so out of the mold?  Probably not, but Nora Roberts knows how to tell a story and publishers know she sells books.<br />In this book, an outspoken female prosecutor is killed.  The victim is a close friend of Eve's boss.  One of the interesting elements of the book is Eve's conflict between office politics and what's best for resolving the case.  The media is hard on the case - and the newly famous female detective.  Her relationship with billionaire, Roarke, only increases the pressure.  Much of the book focuses on the maturation of Eve and Roarke's relationship which has some rocky moments.  <br />I also enjoyed the future setting.  Manhattan in 2058 is an interesting place.  (And everytime I think the gadgets are impossible, I remember my skepticism about a thing called cell phones when a client discussed them in 1983.)  I'm looking forward to learning more about this familiar but not so familiar world.	2001-06-26
US	48523769	R1W3XYMODR88C	0380798468	480213526	Butchers Hill (Tess Monaghan Novel)	Books	4	9	15	N	N	Award winning urban tale	Butchers Hill won both the Agatha and Anthony awards for best paperbacks (as well as being nominated for the MacCavity, Edgar and Shamus paperback awards).  It's a good book but I suspect some publisher marketing or a weak year for the competition.  Butchers Hill is a solid read but hardly earth shattering.<br />First and foremost, this is a very urban tale and not about the pretty side of city life.   The book revolves around Tess' first two clients at her new office.  What start out as simple cases to locate missing persons quickly grow complicated and intertwined.  Tess is thrown into the world of urban foster care issues.  The plotting is strong and I found myself thinking about the book between chapters.<br />My jury is still out on this series.  The Baltimore setting doesn't do much for me - it's pretty bleak through Tess' eyes.  Tess doesn't stand out among her peers in the female P.I. land.  Kinsey and V.I. have been doing similar stuff for a long time.  Of the new generation, I'd rather read Evanovich's Stephanie Plum who seems genuinely orginal (and funny).<br />Bottom-line:  Still not sure what the fuss is about concerning Lippman.  A perfectly adequate read but nothing outstanding.  Reading of previous books in the series (Baltimore Blues and Charm City) is helpful but not essential.	2001-06-25
US	48523769	R2ED7SMN5OJ7MU	0380707837	465821520	White Cargo	Books	5	27	29	N	N	Daddy....	Cat Catledge is just beginning to come to terms with the murders of his wife and daughter when the phone rings.  One word - &quot;Daddy&quot;- and then the phone is hung up.  That phone call leads Cat and the readers on a journey through Colombia as Cat tries to find and rescue his daughter, Jinx.<br />Drug trafficers have fallen out of favor as the villians of choice in thriller fiction.  This book, written in 1988, was written at the height of their popularity and is still a darn good read.  Cat is a good hero - a rich computer printer inventor who has plenty of vulnerabilities (first and foremost his family).  Woods provides an great group of friends to fill the gaps for Cat.  I particularly liked Bluey, the renegade Australian pilot.<br />Since Jinx was kidnapped by pirates off the Colombian coast, much of the book takes place in that country.  Woods does a nice job of telling the reader about the various cities without falling into the traveloge trap.<br />And, yes, the pages turn easily.  A fun read for all (except, maybe, the fathers of beautiful eighteen year old daughters).	2001-06-24

Vulnerable woman ends up on bitter man's ranch and so forth.  The Wedding Raffle is an original in this field.  The Literary Times review details the plot throughly.<br />First and foremost, both Honor and Luke are genuinely likeable.  Both are wounded hearts but the reasons for their wounds ring true and the inevitable recovery happens realistically.  I also really liked Honor's spitfire of a mother-in-law.  <br />Where this book is unusual lies in a very skillful and interesting threat subplot.  Most threat subplots are tedious and annoying.  In this book, Dawson creates a plot that mixes up family dysfunction with a healthy dose of Texas politics in the years before Texas was annexed by the U.S.  Sure I read romances for entertainment but I always enjoy it when education is artfully woven into the plot.   This subplot works really well.<br />Bottom-line:  A much better than average western historical.  I'll keep it on my shelf and might be lending it out.	2001-06-24

He starting writing thrillers while still an active player in the NFL.  Somewhere along the line he picked up a law degree, passed the bar on the first try, and established a business law practice.  He now comments on football in USA Today and on NPR as well as announcing games for FOX (which he says is &quot;like methadone for a heroin addict.&quot;)  He also has four small children.<br />Somehow, in the middle of all of this he writes books.  This is his first book without a hint of football and it worked pretty well for me.  This is your basic vacation reading sort of a book.  It has a well paced plot, is written competently and the chapters leave you wanting to read more.  Green is a bit heavy handed with the forshadowing.  Likewise, the is it Sales or Lipton ping-pong is overdone.  (Makes you wonder how good a writer Green would be if he actually wrote full-time.)<br />The characters vary in quality.  Most interesting for me were Sales, the murder victim's father and Bolinger, the Austin, Texas cop.  Casey Jordan, the lawyer turned slueth, is harder to warm up to.  As for Lipton, the law professor, he is right up there with Hannibal Lector.<br />Bottom-line:  Not likely to win any awards but a good choice for those who like legal thrillers for their entertainment reading.  It is a bit gorey for those with squeamish stomachs.	2001-06-22

While I kept turning the pages, the excessive gore really left me with a very bad feeling about this book and the author.  Which doesn't mean that it's a bad book.  It simply is not the kind of book I prefer to read.  I was already skeptical after reading the first book in the series (A Drink Before the War) but decided to give Lehane a second chance.  After all, this book was included in the Independent Mystery Bookseller's list of the top 100 books of the 20th Century.  This will probably be the end of the line for Lehane in my reading list.<br />In addition to the gore, I simply don't find myself liking Patrick and Angie very much.  Patrick seems to have a pretty shallow notion of love.  Lehane still hasn't given me enough insight into Angie to get a sense of what's there to like.  There are so many mystery series protagonists that I would love to spend time with, it seems silly to invest anymore time in these two.<br />Bottom-line:  Probably a pretty good read for those with a high tolerance for(or interest in) dismembered bodies and the like.  As for me, I'm going to track down some nice cozies where the drama is more mental.	2001-06-22

Still, Michael Connelly has the ability to take that setting and produce a compelling series.  I really enjoyed the earlier Bosch books.  This book is good but I got the sense that Connelly is getting a little bit bored with Bosch.  <br />Much of this book seems to be a rehash of elements of earlier books.  It's back to Vegas - again.  Harry's hauled into IAD - again.  Harry's smoking obsessively - again.  With a movie producer as the victim, I had the sense that Connelly was playing the Hollywood movie card that he'd held in reserve for a day when his writer's block prevented more orginal and compelling plots.  On the positive side, I really like the additions to Harry's police comrades.  It's nice that he finally has a supervisor with a brain.  And I'm optimistic about Eleanor - lone wolf Bosch was due for a change.<br />Bottom-line:  Even a weak link in this series is better than the best that many other authors produce.  Still, not the best book for a first time reader of Connelly to consider.  It's worth going back to the Black Echo and reading this series in order.	2001-06-21

In this case, an American protagonist, Dorothy Martin, guides us through British village life, high church nuances and murder.<br />This book has all of the things I want in a four star rated book.  The writing is always competent and sometimes quite witty.  The plot moved along with only one or two annoying digressions into tourist information.  And, most important, I like Dorothy.  Maybe it because I've recently helped my own mother cope with widowhood but Dams has created a character who ran both true and likeable.  Of course, the hint of an upcoming romance with the widowed chief constable will have me back for more soon.<br />The mystery itself is solid.  There are plenty of suspects with reason to kill the victim.  Was it church politics?  Was it a matter of musical taste?  Was it an agrieved employee?  Was it a jealous scholar?<br />I've held back a fifth star for a couple of reasons.  While I throughly enjoyed the book it isn't so outstanding that I'll be recommending to friends (yet).  Also, as a non-Christian, I felt Dams was a bit heavy handed with the religious angle (even if the victim was a Canon).	2001-06-19

Good, but somehow lacking the magic of the first effort.  That's how I feel about &quot;A Dedicated Man&quot;.  I really debated between giving it three or four stars.  <br />It easily earns three stars as an least average British police procedural.  The writing is competent.  The clues (or lack thereof) all make sense in in the end.  It gets another half star for its many thoughtful observations of the Yorkshire environment - both the landscape and the mentality of the people.  I'm pretty much rounding up the score after that.  I like Banks and plan to keep reading the series which has received considerable praise in recent years.  Still, I haven't found anything so fascinating that I'm going to recommending the book or series to friends---yet.	2001-06-18
US	48523769	RP9BQIBOD1I4V	051512527X	323363922	Blue Moon	Books	3	8	8	N	N	Interesting characters and setting but...	Set in the 1820's when Illinois is on the frontier, Blue Moon has the potential to explore some new territory in the romance genre.  For starters, the main characters are a refuge from a brothel and a man described as the &quot;oldest living virgin in the territory.&quot;  The obstacles to their love (because there must always be obstacles) are even fairly original.  And certainly, Landis can write a terrific romance (Sunflower and Come Spring are permanent members of my keeper shelf).  Somehow, it doesn't all quite come together in Blue Moon.  I'd lay the blame on too much time spent on the threat posed by Darcy, the brothel owner.  The time could have been better spent on more interaction between Olivia and Noah.<br />Also worth noting, this book is the sequel/spin-off to &quot;Just Once.&quot;  I went out of my way to read them in order but that probably isn't necessary to understanding and enjoying Blue Moon.	2001-06-18

I give much of the credit to Andrea Thompson, the perfomer of the unabridged tape who does a terrific job of maximizing the impact of Parker's one liner's and other humorous (if sometimes cynical) asides.  Thompson and Parker combine to create Sunny, a nice addition to the ranks of the female P.I.  As a detective, she's not all that unusual.  It's as a person that Parker has created a person that I'd really like to spend time with.  She's smart but has just the right levels of vulnerability.  I could live without the dog, but I'm not much a of dog person.<br />The underlying mystery (and it's solution) isn't exceptional but is interesting enough to keep this reader involved.  A fifteen year old has run away from home.  Finding out why she's run is ultimately more of a mystery than finding the girl herself.  It brings in a mix of Boston high society, state politics and some local mob wars.  Sunny's ex-father-in-law proves handy.  There's a bit of romance too.<br />Bottom-line:  May be redundant for long time Spenser fans but a very enjoyable read for this new fan of Parker's work.	2001-06-15

For that alone, this book is worth the time it takes to read.  In this book Chas is working on a series of columns about how restaurants manipulate (if not plain cheat) their customers to spend much more money than planned.<br />The problem with this book stems from this same subject.  At times, Richman loses sight of her fiction writing and writes with a lecturer's tone.  It's a mixed blessing as the information is often fascinating.  Still, it disturbs the pacing of the fictional plot.  The plot/mystery in this book is a bit far-fetched but the book is set in Washington D.C.  It's being to appear that almost anything can happen there.<br />Bottom-line: A fun read for anyone who engages in recreational restauranting.  Reading of her first book &quot;The Butter Did It&quot;  would be helpful but isn't critical.	2001-06-14

Somehow I don't think Prodigal Summer will meet the same fate.  Not that it's a bad book.  It just lacks the power of Poisonwood.  Perhaps it's due to the less exotic setting.<br />Still, Kingsolver actually makes the triple and parallel plot device work pretty well.  I didn't expect to like the &quot;Old Chesnuts&quot; plot but it was the one I looked forward to most by the end.  While the eroticism of &quot;Predators&quot; was fun, Deanna's preachiness wore thin quickly.  And while it wasn't exactly a fun read, I suspect that Lusa and the &quot;Moth Love&quot; story line may actually linger the longest.<br />I read this for a book club and it produced the good (but not great) discussion common when everyone in the group is essentially in agreement about liking the book.  I'd give it 3 and 1/2 stars if the system allowed.	2001-06-14

It happens to be one of my favorites and it's always fun to read a well done version.  In this case, Win owns all but the house of the Texas ranch he grew up on.  The late owner's will provides that it will be inherited by Win's wife.  Only one problem -- Win has no wife and the prospects are bleak.  With only hours to go, he convinces the widow living in the shanty to marry him.  Kora has her own pragmatic reasons to agree - she and her siblings are starving. Proximity and chemistry do the rest.<br />The auxillary plot is pretty much the western cliche of a threat to the ranch with mysterious riders in black dusters.  It doesn't add much to book.  Thomas does manage to stay out off the worst of the half-breed plot cliches.<br />Thomas produces some good romantic tension and chemistry between Win and Kora.  I read the book in three hours straight and will hold on to it, at least for awhile.  The Romance Reader, a magazine, awarded the book five stars.	2001-06-14

Laura is an aspiring painter (training with Titian) who is planning to finance her studio by becoming a courtesan.  Sandro is a forty-something nobleman who heads up the police.  They meet when the Doge's assistant is killed just after visiting Laura's bordello.  Shortly thereafter ruffians assault Laura and the mystery begins....<br />In someways this is a May to December romance.  Indeed, the obstacles to their joining are obvious from the start - he's twice her age and would lose his status as a noble if he marries a commoner.  She, in turn, has genuine artistic talent if she can just get admitted to the all-male Academy.  He, of course, is not too wild about her finacing plans.<br />The mystery works well in this romance and has a genuinely surprising ending.  I also really enjoyed the insights on life in 16th Century Venice.	2001-06-08

It couldn't be as good.  Well, I was wrong.  It may even be better.<br />I suspect that Stabenow was simply getting bored with Kate and wanted to write something a little different.  Well, in Liam she's created a great format to tell us about that unusual species, the Alaskan Male.  (Hey, they even have - or had - magazine about the phenomenon.)  A healthy chunk of this book is about the war between the sexes, Alaskan style.  Sure, the mystery takes a back seat but the humorous observations more than made up for it.<br />As for the mystery, Liam is literally landing at the airport when the first suspicious death occurs.  By the time the mystery is resolved, the reader has met a cast of eccentric characters that somehow ring entirely true, learned A LOT about herring roe fishing, and gotten under the skin of a macho man dealing with his world seemingly falling apart.  There's plenty of crime in Newenham, much of it falling into the boozed up small town variety (shooting the jukebox and the post office) but something deeper and uglier is going on.  There's an amazing amount of money at stake in the herring season.  Could that be the cause?  Or is it just small town romance gone wrong?<br />Bottom-line:  A genuinely enjoyable read even if Stabenow digresses from the mystery plot at times.  Liam Campbell is a nice mix of too good to be true and 1990's angst inside.  I'll be reading the next book in the series soon.	2001-06-06

It's just that it's hard to pin down anything exceptionally good or bad to say about it.  <br />While a female homicide detective is still pretty rare in both fiction and the real world, there are so many female protagonists in mystery fiction that Kate Gillespie doesn't really stand out for me.  Her character doesn't seem very deep - aside from a fondness for lattes and the good sense to live in the East Bay, she's pretty one dimensional.  The plot is more than a little conviluted with far too many players, potential hints and stage business for my taste.  It's all explained in the end but some of the sub-plots prove to be pretty irrelevant.<br />And then there's the men in her life.  Her ex-husband is actually one of the more interesting characters in the book - sort of a creep but maybe not.  The relationship with her supervisor has chemistry and trouble written all over it.  Burcell does an adequate job of working the Bay Area setting into the story line although the plot could have been set almost anywhere.  My biggest gripe is that Kate never seems to encounter traffic on the Bay Bridge -- clearly a work of fiction.<br />Bottom-line: A pleasant read for fans of mysteries with female protagonists or set in the Bay Area.  Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.	2001-06-06

It made for very powerful reading that haunts me weeks after reading the book.  He grows a bit more venturesome in The End of War with somewhat more mixed results.  <br />There are still three very real people in fictionalized form in this book.  The tough part is that they are Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill.  He also adds three fictional stories - Russian soldiers, an American photojouralist and a mother and daughter in Berlin.  In the audiotape interview he states that his intention is to borrow from the Greek tragedy structure of the Gods orchestrating from above and the impact of their decisions on the mortals.  <br />In an overall sense, Robbins is very successful at explaining the mix of loftly and petty motivations behind the Allies decisions in the Spring of 1945.  On one hand, there are thoughtful decisions but there are also big decisions made for very human reasons.  For example, at a point when the Americans and the Russians are both about 60 miles from Berlin, Roosevelt acquieses to letting the Russians take Berlin in an unspoken trade for the Russians' participation in Roosevelt's dream - the United Nations.  Imagine what the world might have been like if the Americans had liberated Berlin.<br />The actual reading experience of the book is good but not great.  The six plotlines rotate along the timeline of history.  Sometimes the transitions flow but others are abrupt.  There's also so much potential material in each sub-plot that none of them feels fully developed.  Robbins' prose is solid with some very dramatic scenes.   <br />Bottom-line:  A good read for fans of historical fiction.  If you can, try to listen to the interview at the end of the Recorded Books unabridged tape.  It provides some great insights on Robbins research and his message.	2001-06-03

Sure there are some things that are dated but I like to think of that as adding to the authenticity.  And yes, by the time everything is sorted out at the end, it's pretty easy for the reader to say that the clues were all out there in plain sight.  But as you read, Dame Agatha does a nice job of keeping you guessing.  (This is due in part to her spliting up Tommy and Tuppence for the better part of the novel.  The reader learns what each of them learn but they don't always have the chance to communicate with each other.)<br />I enjoyed the political espionage aspects of the book as well as being able to see the evolving romance.  The Russian Revolution is a very real thing for these characters as is the post-war readjustment.<br />I haven't read any other books in the Beresford series but I really like the mix of spunk and pragmatism in these two.  They have a youth and spirit and are a nice contrast to Marple and Poirot.  I'll keep reading all three series but the Beresfords may get a bit of priority.	2001-06-01

But all the reviews by other readers made me step back and think again.  I'm still extremely glad that I read this book but it is a book to take with the proverbial grain of salt.  The following are some of the thoughts this book provoked for me....<br />First, it is interesting to me that the book turns conventional political wisdom on it's head in terms of &quot;friendly&quot; and &quot;enemy&quot; states.  From Brooks point of view, Iran and Iraq are actually pretty good places to be a woman if access to some political power and fitness are the standards.  Alternatively, our Desert Storm ally, Saudi Arabia, is a place that is far less in tune with American values, if measured in terms of the western standard of women's rights.  I also felt that Brooks didn't spend enough time on two geographic categories - women in the small Gulf States and Muslim women in European and American societies.<br />On a separate note, maybe I'm naive but it seemed pretty absurd to me that all this separation of the sexes is simply because the sight of a woman's flesh or the sound of a woman's voice could cause unpure/sexual thoughts.  Well, I mentioned this to my husband who basically said &quot;well, yeah, those those things do cause those sorts of thoughts.&quot;  So now I'm left to ponder whether Islam is trying to fight the inevitable tide of lustful thoughts or if maybe it has the right idea.    Maybe Dave Barry is right when in his book &quot;Complete Guide to Guys&quot; he says &quot;I'm not saying that womend don't think about sex.  I'm saying that women are capable, for at least brief periods of time, of not thinking about sex, and the most guys are not.&quot;<br />Likewise, as a Unitarian Universalist, I'd like to think that there are positives and negatives in all religions and cultures.  Yes, I find the idea of clitorectomies pretty horrific.  Still, it seems like most of the western women I know are experiencing the functional equivalent of sexual drive neutralizing in the form of exhaustion as they persue the western ideal lifestyle.  And it's not like we don't have our fair share of fundamentalists who would like to see women back in the home and dressing &quot;properly&quot;.<br />Bottom-line:  Not a book to swallow as the absolute truth but a book that can be a valuable place to start in thinking about different ways of dealing with the differences between men and women.  (And while I missed the discussion, my book group reports that this was a dandy book for a lively debate.)	2001-06-01

It's good but I don't think it's all that good.<br />Basically,  the first quarter of the book is pretty conventional Regency farce including a rather absurd section on a day for each of the seven sins.  Also, Dominic is a pretty self-centered jerk in the early pages.  The book improves as the setting shifts to Scotland and Catronia's true mission (one with considerably more worth than her original story) emerges.  The book is probably at its best when exploring the politics of Scotland in the early 19th century.  The romance plot worked reasonably well but was nothing exceptional.<br />Bottom-line: Five stars for Scottish history and politics and three stars for a so-so romance = four stars overall.	2001-05-30

Jane lives in a remote coastal area where here neighbors include a couple of &quot;pulp&quot; fiction writers, a critic and some other unusual folks.  Of course, a corpse turns up.  <br />The first two-thirds of the book are solid, if unexceptional.  It's interesting to watch Dagliesh walk the tightrope of investigating a death that isn't his job - and for once to have the official police investigators portrayed as reasonably competent folks.  And while other reviews were let down by the ending, I found the final third to be page turning stuff.  (Of course, being in the middle of a major thunder storm helped :)) I found the plotting to be nicely complex and the solution to be that nice mix - a surprise but one that made sense when all of the reasons were laid on the table.<br />For new readers this book has fewer references to Dagliesh's friends and on-going life than some of the others.  I.e. - you won't be frustrated landing in the middle of ongoing plots, but you also aren't getting a full picture of his life that evolves with the reading of the series in order.	2001-05-29

Far more important though, IMHO, is that this series is both illuminating and entertaining.  This book provides insights on the pilgrimage experience, something often referred to in other stories but rarely described in detail.  It also continues the series' complex telling of the relations between Christians and Jews at a time when church and state are virtually identical.<br />All of this happens in the midst of the evolving relationship of Catherine, her husband Edgar and Catherine's extended family.  Then just to make things interestings, their traveling companions start to die at regular intervals.  It's a cozy in the sense that the murderer must be part of the traveling party and the gore is pretty minimal.  Still, as the layers are unveiled war, politics, religion, abuse and a whole host of other factors come into play.<br />Bottom-line:  A very good read for fans of historical fiction.  This is a series that is well worth reading in order to best understand Catherine and Edgar.  It starts with Death Comes as Epiphany, winner of the McCavity for best first novel for 1993.	2001-05-27

I might have liked the print version of the book assuming it filled it the gaping holes in the abridged tape.  As it was, the tape was a frustrating experience in trying to keep track of a very large cast of characters; unexpected flashbacks; and sudden changes of scene.  LeCarre's narration didn't help as he often spoke too softly.<br />I'm not even sure if I can wrote coherently about the plot.  Truely the tape was so scattered that I only have a mild sense of the complexities motivating Oliver.  The rest of the characters, including some with terrific potential such as his father, are barely two-dimensional as abridged.  I did manage to grasp that Oliver is torn between loyalties to his father and to the British government.<br />Bottom-line:  Maybe the print version is worth reading but avoid the tape.	2001-05-25

They looked so long and boring.  Well, the unabridged tape of Street of the Five Moons is hardly boring and the time flew by.  Much of the credit goes to narrator Barbara Rosenblatt.  Peter's writing is full of pithy asides and Rosenblatt does them to perfection.  I lost track of the chuckles this tape produced.  She also juggles four accents (American, German, English and Italian) with ease.  Through it all, she has great diction and inflection.  <br />And, yes, there's a pretty good book underneath it all.  Before her incredible success with the Amelia Peabody series, Elizabeth Peters wrote two other series.  This book is the second in the Vicky Bliss series.  Vicky is a Munich based American art historian.  She's a fun character with a wicked sense of humor.  The first book in the series was set in Rothenberg, Germany.  This book is set in Rome and Tivoli with a comfortable level of tourist tidbits.<br />The plot is this book is only so-so.  Great works of art are being forged, including a piece from Vicky's museum employer.  Preliminary clues send her to Rome.  It's all a bit far fetched but I liked spending time with Vicky so much that the flaws in the plotline were minor irritations.<br />Bottom-line:  Can't say how this would read in print but certainly a charming, fun audiotape.	2001-05-25

It seemed time to check out the book series that is the basis for the show.  All I can say is that I'm glad I had the show as a mental resource.  It's hard to point to any one problem with the book.  Perhaps the problem is that the book was written in 1970 and is a bit dated.  Perhaps the problem is that much of the book centers on rugby, a sport I don't know in the slightest.  And, perhaps, there are just some rough edges in the first time writer's style.  Bottom line was that I found the book a bit of chore to get through.  Still, I like the characters well enough that I'll certainly give Hill another chance (or two).	2001-05-23

Warshawski series as they were released and thought I know Vic pretty well.  However, this first book in the series proved an unexpected source of new insights on one of the leading ladies of PI fiction.  Some of it was simply background stuff.  More interesting was just getting a sense of who she is and why she ticks.  <br />The mystery is interesting enough.  A University of Chicago student has gone missing.  Before she can blink, VI is immersed in a murder mystery with links to big insurance, a sleazy union and a very dangerous mobster.  Still, her sarcastic humor and basic good heart come through as we tour greater Chicago.  The pages turn easily.<br />Bottom line:  Certainly a good read for those who are new to the series and not a bad read for longtime fans.	2001-05-23

Well, SEP has returned to the Chicago Stars and this may be one of her best.  I devoured this book even as I wiped away tears (of tenderness and laughter).<br />In Molly, SEP has created an incredibly likeable heroine.  Molly is a great mixture of spunk and wild imagination with a fragile interior.  Kevin is a complicated jock who is still dealing with childhood baggage.  Other authors try to write this combination into their characters, but SEP really makes it work in this book. I loved Molly's imaginary world with Daphne the high fashion bunny and Benny, the wild badger.  Even the real world secondary characters are colorful without being unreal.<br />The plot is probably only a four star effort as it's a bit contrived.  Still, I liked Molly and Kevin so much that I stayed up way past my usual bedtime just to find out how they were going to straighten out their complicated romance.<br />And for all those romance publishers who say the jocks can't be heroes, if this is an example of just how good a romance about athletes can be, then I can only hope that more publishers will get on the bandwagon.	2001-05-23

Set in 1958, in the height of the Spudnik anxiety, the reader gets a mix of early space program with D.C. area political intrigue.<br />Follett has assembled an interesting central cast - a group of friends from their days at Harvard (late 30's/early 40's) who went on to intrigue in WW2.  They're now in their late 30's and crossing paths as the countdown to the last hope for the American space program is due to launch.  Our protagonist, Luke, wakes up with amnesia and the story begins.  Along the way, he's able to look at old friends with fresh eyes.  An old flame comes to his rescue and well....<br />Wow, what a group of mixed opinions in these reviews.  All I can say that as a middle aged reader who hasn't seen all those Hitchcock movies, this was an entertaining read.  I listened to George Guidell's unabridged reading and found myself sitting in parking lots so I could just listen to a few more pages.  That doesn't happen all that often these days.	2001-05-22

The sisters are up to their usual bickering in a way that brings a smile to the reader's lips on a regular basis (and out and out laughter on occasion).<br />This episode focuses on geneology after the aunt of the groom, a genologist, dies in a suspicious fall.  Could she have been killed for unearthing a branch of a family tree that should have stayed buried?  The whole lineage thing is all the funnier for the southern setting where what one's ancestors did in the Civil War really matters to some people.<br />The book loses a fifth star for a disappointing ending.  Likewise, once you know the ending some of the actions of the killer don't quite make sense.  Still, I certainly enjoyed the read to get there.	2001-05-21

For that alone, true mystery fans need to read at least a few of the books in the series.  This book isn't exactly typical (of the ones I've read so far) in that most of the action takes place in a fictional fishing town several hours south of SF.  Many of the regulars in Sharon's life are only seen in a glimpse but the new folks are plenty interesting.<br />The mystery is both simple and complex.  How so?  When the killer is unveiled, it wasn't anyone I'd put on my list (the surprise) but I kicked myself for not considering that person (in hindsight, there had been enough clues).<br />I listened to the unabridged audiotape of this book, narrated by a woman named Dunn.  It may be a matter of personal taste but I found her narration to be technically correct but so flat in emotion that I suspect it detracted from my enjoyment of the book.  I'll be reading the paper versions in the future.	2001-05-16

What is wasn't (at least for me) is the literary blockbuster that I read about in the critical reviews.  There just isn't that much meat to this work. I liked the format of vignettes going back in time.  At the same time, that format left me hanging without resolution on some of the stories and thinking &quot;why bother&quot; about others.  The writing has all the earmarks of modern, slightly pretentious literary fiction.  Her writing it for creative writing classes comes through, unfortunately.<br />Our book club struggled to find a half-hours worth of material to discuss in the book.  We'd hoped for more.	2001-05-15

I'm glad I gave it that chance.<br />I won't rehash the plot - there are other good reviews of it.  It's an ok story though I felt the second half of the book was a rather weak resolution to a promising premise.<br />It's Elvis that makes this book sing.  He's growing into an intriguing, complicated personality without the dark side (i.e. alcoholism, smoking, anger) seen so often in PI fiction.  His quirks are fun (all the cartoon references).  More than that, this man knows and loves his food.  Even better, he shares more than a few terrific meals with us.  I was salivating for all the wonderful Asian food more than once.  <br />Bottom-line:  I'll be reading the next book in this series soon.  For new readers, this is the second book in the series.  It's probably not critical to read the first book to enjoy this book.	2001-05-15

As a certifiable yarnaholic I generally read (and enjoy) almost anything about knitting.  However, I struggled with reading this book and then how to rate it fairly.  It isn't necessarily a medicore book; it simply isn't my &quot;cup of tea.&quot;<br />Each chapter has three parts: a story from mythology or a fairy tale; a section of instruction; and a simple design loosely tied into the theme of the chapter.  This is a really terrific book if you are (1)into new age spirituality and (2) a beginning knitter.  Since I am neither, it just didn't do much for me.<br />There is a very good section on fibers and their various personalities.	2001-05-15

What is fun and unusual about this book is that two women are kidnapped.  Oh joy, something a tad bit new in a genre where women are carried away solo regularly.  However, Barnett doesn't do much with the women together, choosing instead to write two parallel love stories.  The love stories are ok.  The Georgieana plot line seemed a bit stereotypical but I enjoyed the Amy plot line.  <br />Otherwise, as a reader I found it distracting to not have any sense of the timeframe of the book.  For the first 100 or so pages, it could have been set anytime after the 1800.  Eventually, there are enough hints to narrow it down to the late 1800's.<br />Bottom-line: A pleasant before bed read but not going to be a keeper in my collection.  Still others must have really liked it -- it is a winner of a Romantic Times Reviewers Choice award.	2001-05-14

The editorial reviews provide a great summary of the plot of this complicated kidnapping story.  Let me add that the book was nominated for three best novel of the year awards -- McCavity, Agatha and Barry.  It deserves that type of recognition.<br />What makes this book unique is that Irene is so normal.  I'm getting a bit weary of the &quot;hard-boiled female PI&quot; that is so popular these days.  The lonely woman with one (or more) major problems (alcoholism, anger, etc.)can be a bit hard to relate to, not to mention boring.  Irene has grown from one of these characters to a newlywed.  No small part of this book involves her trying to balance her professional needs with her need to save her husband.  The fact that the search takes her back to his family and former girlfriend just makes things that much more interesting.<br />The kidnapping itself is full of unusual twists.  The kidnappers motivation lies in childhood trauma and the desire to force the determination of the unknown cop who caused that trauma.  Interesting stuff.<br />Bottom-line: A tight, page turner.  Reading of the previous four books in the series would be helpful but isn't imperative.	2001-05-14

At the same time, my husband is just now reading them for the first time and I've been re-reading the old books so I can enjoy them with him.  So, with the perspective of nine books, I opine that this is not one of the best.  <br />It's an ok read but nothing that kept me up past my bedtime.  I'm not sure what doesn't work in the book.  After the high politics of Higher Authority, this book seems somewhat mundane.  The victim, Peter, is interesting but not very empathetic.  It's hard to care much about him and why he died.  The book is a bit too scattered with too many deaths.  Perhaps my lack of satisfaction derived from the ending which is far too skimpy and leaves many questions unanswered.  Also, the usual poking fun at Coloradans (and Boulder in particular) is lacking.<br />Bottom-line:  I'm still a big fan of this series.  First time readers of the series are strongly encouraged to start at the beginning (Private Practices) since it is much more enjoyable to grow with the central cast of characters.	2001-05-12

Barr had done a masterful job with the park settings but the human element hadn't quite clicked.  Things come together much better in this book, the third in the series.<br />As always, Barr takes the reader on a wonderful insiders tour of life in the National Park Service - this time at Mesa Verde in southwestern Colorado.  (Hillerman fans will find a different perspective on the high desert but it works well.)  The mystery is plenty solid.  An unusually high number of medical emergencies are occuring in the park.  Then a ranger is found dead in mysterious circumstances.  At the same time, a domestic situation is plaguing Anna's days.  Then there are reportings of appearances of mysterious night spirits.  Are the Anazazi returning?  It all comes together with a nice mix of Anna's brain power and puzzle pieces fitting together.<br />Still, what elevates this book above the first two books is Anna's struggle with her inner demons.  We learn much more about her marriage and widowhood as Anna tries to come to terms with her attraction to certain men in her life.  As the deaths start to pile up, Anna's alcoholism begins to really complicate her life.  In some books this would be too much but Barr makes it work - a good balance for the sometimes too smart and clever public face of Anna.<br />Bottom-line:  A good read for all.  Fans of the southwest will really enjoy the co-star of the book, Mesa Verde.  Reading of the first two books in the series is helpful but not necessary.	2001-05-12

First, George Guidall does a his usual terrific job with the narrative.  More importantly, my edition included an hour long interview with the author which crystalizes just what an accomplishment this book is.<br />First, this is only loosely fictionalized fact - Zaitzev is a real person.  Indeed, Robbins was able to interview him for the book (and Zaitzev was so excited he had a heart attack).  Chernova is real except for the fact that his publishers made him make her an American.  And yes, Zaitzev and Chernova did fight and love together.  Likewise, the duel with Thorvald is also real although Robbins admits to fleshing in his character.  Even some of the side stories are real such as the story of the Muslim who delievered food to the snipers.  And, he admits that &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; was a major resource and inspiration for this book.<br />As for the reading (listening) experience, this is a darn good book.  It starts off a bit slow but then I'm not a hunter.  My hunter husband loved all the detail about the guns and successful sniping.  I was more fascinated by the characters inner thoughts on war and killing.  Zaitzev snipes by hunting intuition.  Chernova hunts the &quot;sticks&quot; out of pain and anger over the murder of her family.  Thorvald snipes people using the language of skeet shooting.  The details of the courage in spite of the suffering are very inspiring.<br />Bottom-line: an entertaining education about an aspect of WW2 most Americans know little or nothing about.	2001-05-09

The Brother Cadefel series is now well into its third decade but the writing (and the reading) remains fresh and entertaining.  This book won the British Silver Dagger (top runner up for best novel) in 1980 and it could still be a contender.<br />This episode has Cadefel defending the child of his childhood sweetheart after the poisoning of her new husband.  We learn a bit more about Cadefel's background - both in Wales and as a Crusader.  Hugh Beringer returns as the honest and smart deputy.  I also rather liked Cadefel's new assistant, Mark - a monk with spunk.  The action takes Cadefel to the Welsh borderlands and it's fun to see him in a new context.<br />Bottom-line:  Not exactly a page-turner but a wonderful read to savor and enjoy over a couple of days.	2001-05-07

This one's going right back to the used book store.  I finished it but overall is was a flat, tedious read for me.  <br />So what doesn't work in this book.  For starters, Raine and Jack are both entirely two-dimensional to be very interesting.  It's as if the author invested all of her creativity in the supporting cast (which is plenty colorful).  Nothing happened to make me care if they got together.  Also, as a former attornery, the legal aspects were pretty shaky.<br />Still, I may well read the sequel, Far Harbor, since I already like Raine's sister.	2001-05-04

Still, at the end of each chapter of Lion in the Valley, I found myself easily distracted.  This is most disappointing as this is one of my favorite mystery series.  Many of the usual attributes are present including Amelia's pithy wit and Ramses' precociousness.  What seems to be missing is the mystery.  Oh, there's a vague hint of a threat and then a vague, unsatisfying finish to the book.  But the tension never really takes off.  <br />Bottom-line:  A pleasant read for those already familiar with the series but a poor choice if you've never read any other books in the Amelia Peabody series.	2001-05-04

Jo Beth is back with her nice mix of sass and humor.  The kennel is growing but there are a few problems - including a vicious ex-husband on the loose and a missing businessman.  Romance is in the air for all the ladies at the kennel - or so it seems.  <br />The highlights of the book are two-fold.  First, it's always nice to read a mystery that doesn't have a dead body.

I appreciate and agree (to some degree) with both camps.  This is not you usual British murder mystery and it may - or may not - be a taste you'll enjoy (a bit like drinking Scotch whiskey).<br />The writing is highly stylized.  Each time you pick up the book, it takes a few pages to connect with Caudwell's dry and ascerbic tone.  Hence, not a great book to read if you're at risk of interuptions.  Likewise, the unusual format wherein the reader is asked to solve the mystery long-distance through a series of letters is different.  I found it to be a refreshing change but can sympathize with those who would prefer a more hands-on mystery.  <br />Another unusual aspect of the book is the narrator, Hillary Tamar.  We are told almost nothing about her.  On one hand, it makes her rather mysterious but on the other hand, it doesn't make her very interesting or warm.  The rest of the legal band aren't much deeper.  The tour group is a bit more fleshed out but are still pretty two dimensional.  The underlying mystery is pretty simple, though it took me awhile to figure it out.<br />Still, this book was selected by the International Mystery Booksellers as one of the top 100 mysteries of the 20th Century.  Caudwell's later books have received many accolades and I'm optimistic that the glitches in this first book will be fixed.	2001-05-04

Based on the volume of strong and positive reviews for the book on paper, something must have been lost (big time) in the abridgement for tape.  What I heard can only be described as a adult cartoon played by two-dimensional characters in a fantasy.  Bottom-line:  Save your money and buy the book in paper.	2001-04-26
US	48523769	R317FH5JG267M2	0671045776	316856658	Hermit's Peak: A Kevin Kerney Novel (Kevin Kerney Novels)	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Abridged tape doesn't quite click	Having heard all three previous books in the Kevin Kearny series in their unabridged form, this 4.5 hour abridged version left me rather flat.  I realize this is the norm for the commercial tapes but I find the orchestrated music annoying.  I also am ambivalent about the narrator.  His speech patterns are authentic to the New Mexicans I've known.  At the same time, it's a clipped speech pattern that was bothersome to me at times.<br />As for the book itself, this isn't as strong an offering as Serpent Gate.  It's fun to have Sara Brannon back and to have Kearney struggling with the love thing.  But this book (and this may be the fault of the abridgement) lacks much of the charm of earlier stories.  I really missed his gay landlord -- tho the dog, Shoe, is fun.  Fundamentally, the crimes that he's investigating are rather pedestrian after the sophisticated crimes of Serpent's Gate.  Also, I second the comment of the reader that the abundance of place names and players was hard to keep track of - particularly when listening instead of reading.<br />Still, this is a good series.  For new readers, I'd strongly advise not starting with this book as there are many references and plot lines that stem from earlier books.  And, after reading one too many mysteries with alcoholic or otherwise ugly protagonists, it is so refreshing to have a hero who's basically a good guy.	2001-04-26

But I am most glad that my book club chose this book.  The bottom line is that I read 364 page of science (about 360 pages more than I do most years).  Not only that, I learned many useful things about how my body works.  Even better, I had a few good laughs along the way.<br />What works best in this book is often a question of where the reader is at in her life.  The younger women in our group were very interested in the sections (many) on reproduction.  The aging boomers in the group were more fascinated by the sections on hormones and a wonderful chapter on why post-menopausal women may be a key factor in why man evolved beyond the apes.<br />Still, I'm taking one star off for inconsistent writing.  Angier wanders between &quot;plain english&quot;/journalist writing and science writing.  The Ph.D's in our group thought there was too much &quot;silly&quot; writing.  We non-scientists agreed that there were segments that seemed to be written in a foreign language.  No wonder there's so much contraversy in the reviews.<br />Bottom-line:  A good read for women who know they know far too little about the uniquely feminine part of their biology.	2001-04-25

While the writing won't win him a Pulitzer, it certainly provides a reader with good, page-turning suspense.  The territory is pretty familiar stuff but he does a craftmen's quality job with it.<br />I won't rehash the plot but I must comment on Carol Starkey.  Both my husband and I found ourselves really disliking this character.  Fundamentally, Crais has gone way overboard in making her a poster girl for the walking wounded.  Surely she could have be a nicely complicated heroine simply on the basis of being brought back from the dead, being horribly scarred, and having lost the love of her life before her very eyes.  The chain-smoking, hard-drinking components were the worst kind of overkill.  Worse than that, both of these habits occupied way too much space while doing little to move the plot forward.<br />Bottom-line:  A book that works as a page-turner but flawed enough that I'll think twice before picking up another book with Carol Starkey as a protagonist.	2001-04-25
US	48523769	RS25DD0EOY6K	0312955901	916977288	China Trade	Books	4	32	34	N	N	Entertaining, educational debut in Chinese American series	In a genre that is finally reasonalby well populated by woman and African Americans, an Asian slueth (of either gender) is still a rarity.  Enter Lydia Chin, an ABC (American Born Chinese)who still lives with her mother in Manhattan's growing Chinatown.  For me, a native of Oakland (which has a strong Asian community), the highlight of this book is the entire sensory experience.  Rozan, an Anglo, does a wonderful job of writing a book that stimulates the senses of smell and taste.  It doesn't hurt that Lydia loves to eat and shares her wonderful meals with the reader.<br />The mystery revolves around a couple of crates of missing Chinese porcelains (hence a wonderful pun in the title).  Lydia and her sort of partner, Bill, explore a mix of Manhattan museums and gangs as they seek the china.  The resolution is nicely complicated and shouldn't be obivous - at least to the Anglo reader.<br />What keeps the book from pure hard boiled status is Lydia's meddling family (they don't approve of her work); a convenient best friend who's a cop; and Lydia's ambiguous relationship with Bill (good ABC girls aren't supposed to be attracted to white dectectives).<br />Bottom line: A solid debut in a series I'm already looking forward to reading again.	2001-04-24

For starters, the reader really gets to know Alex better in this book and he's beginning to grow on me.  The core plot is dandy and the resolution is a page turner.  And, while Alex is based in Los Angeles, much of the action takes place near the Mexican border in an interestingly twisted imaginary town called La Vista.<br />The weakest point of the book is an virtually unrelated divorce plot which absorbs way too much of the first half of the book.  Likewise, the horticulture sections needed some serious editing.<br />Bottom-line: A solid entry in the Delaware series, which in turn is a solid but not spectacular series.  After two books, Alex has yet to break new frontiers or do anything that hasn't been done before.  Maybe in the next book....	2001-04-23

In that sense, this first novel in the DCI Barnaby series certainly qualifies.  Badger's Drift is a collection of buildings (village would be generous) at a T intersection.  Virtually every resident is a suspect and they're a nicely mixed lot.  Cozy heroes (and heroines) tend to have warm and fuzzy aspects - Barnaby has a wife he adores despite her utter inability to cook and loves to putz around in his garden.<br />What cozies don't contain, as a rule, are multiple murders, reformed and current prostitutes and illicit relationships that are, shall I say, more than adultry.  <br />I really enjoyed the mixed tone of the book, even after I realized I'd seen the screen version on TV a few years ago.  Graham does a nice job of taking many classical mystery elements and giving them a new spin.  I'll admit that, knowing the ending, I was looking extra hard for the clues that would lead to the resolution.  There weren't many but there were a few.<br />It's also worth noting that this book won a McCavity for best first novel and was selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers as one of their top 100 mysteries of the 20th Century.<br />Bottom-line: A nice series for those who like British mysteries but want a little less rough stuff than Daziel &amp; Pascoe or Frost.	2001-04-21

The main virtue of &quot;The Flower Net&quot; is a nice change of pace on all three counts.  Despite the opening of China, it's still a pretty rare setting for fiction, mystery fiction in particular.  Likewise, the featuring of a female Chinese investigator was refreshing in concept.  Even better is that she's a nicely complicated yet empathetic protagonist.  Her American counterpart, David, isn't nearly as interesting.  While the villians aren't surprising in the long haul, they aren't just the usual Triad types either.<br />If the book has a weakness, it's the revived romance between Liu and David.  It seemed irrelevant to be crime solving and not very interesting.<br />This review is based on the six-hour abridged tape version.  I found that the plot followed pretty well.  The narrator, an American-Chinese woman was a mixed blessing.  Certainly there were aspects of the story where her underlying speach patterns were perfect but sometimes her tone was a bit awkward.<br />Bottom-line:  A nice change of pace from mysteries set in the US or England.  Not great literature but I learned some new things and like Liu enough to want to read a sequel.	2001-04-20

After all, it had won the Agatha for best first novel and had been nominated in the same category for an Anthony, a Barry, a Dilys, a McCavity and a Romantic Times Reviewer's Choice.  It's a fun, reasonably entertaining read. Still, the competition must have been pretty weak to get so many nominations.<br />The book is fundamentally equal parts humor, romance, and mystery.  As is often the case when trying to do so much, nothing is done exceptionally well.  I certainly had a few laughs - as would any former maid of honor.  (Quite frankly, if I'd been maid of honor for any of the three brides, some justifiable homicide might have occured.)  The book is about weddings and certainly has some romantic moments.  The mystery takes a back seat for much of the book - sort of an amusing sideline for Meg's eccentric father.  The ultimate resolution is no big surprise but at least the three wedding days are completed.<br />Still, I enjoyed this book.  It may not be perfectly crafted but it flowed well for a light, before bedtime sort of read.	2001-04-20

I like Tess - I just don't love her.  The writing is good - but not great enough to be noteworthy.  The side characters are ok (they were more interesting in the first book) but certainly lack the pizazz of, say, the side characters in Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.  There's some humor but somehow it only makes me chuckle, not laugh out loud.<br />This is the second book in Lippman's series.  It's probably not necessary to read the first in the series to understand this book.  The first book, Baltimore Blues, is both better and worse.  This book has much stronger plotting between the saga of the planted stories about the basketball promoter and the tale of Esskay, the retired greyhound.  At the same time, Lippman's use of Baltimore as a setting is almost invisible.  Baltimore was such an interesting part of the first book.<br />I'll probably keep reading this series, but less out of affection for Tess than simply because all those critics and award committees must be seeing something worthwhile.  Maybe with another episode, I'll see it too.	2001-04-16

I'm trying to fill the gaps in order.  I'm glad I'd read several other books in this series first otherwise, I'd probably not read anymore.  <br />Basically, Design for Murder, is too designed.  The blueprint is laidout entirely too clearly to be entertaining.  I know the classic cozy has a list of suspects but it felt like that list was repeated over and over and over again in this book.  I second the reviewer who commented that it was hard to care who murdered the victim.  Indeed, I was simply annoyed that it took about half of the book to knock the obnoxious woman off.<br />As for the &quot;name-dropping&quot;, that is precisely the signature of this series.  This is a series for mystery addicts to enjoy all of the references to writers and characters.  I get about half of them and there's always a little sense of being &quot;in the club&quot; when I know what she's talking about.  However, this is also the reason I haven't passed these books on to my husband.  All the references to Poirot and Wimsey and the like wouldn't mean a thing to him.<br />Bottom-line: Not the best book in an otherwise good series.	2001-04-16

Fundamentally, it's a book about a romance that emerges out of a life and death situation.  We've all seen in in the movies and it makes the pages turn.  It just doesn't happen to be my favorite plot line.  The pragmatist in me simply doesn't like the &quot;happily ever after&quot; chances of a couple that falls in love while in peril. <br />But if you like that combination of romance and suspense, this is a darn good example of the genre.  Velvet is a spunky heroine.  It was particularly nice that she doesn't spend half the book denying her feelings.  She feels and she acts on her feelings.  Jason's baggage is probably necessary for the plot but got a bit old - particularly since the author waits way too long to expose his big secret.  And, if you have to have a villian, Avery is decidedly evil.  <br />Bottom-line:  Good sensual tension and plenty of suspense (if you're into that type of a book.)  If you're like me and like a romance without outside evil, you're better off with a writer such as Judith McNaught.	2001-04-13

How fun to find a book that is just a an exciting fun read with glamourous settings and a murderer who wears up-grade cashmere.  (My last Boston set mystery was a Dennis Lehane - this is a completely different version of Boston, thank heavens).<br />Oh, there's blood and gore but there's also champagne and romance.  I often don't care for the mix but Adler does a terrific job of the blend.  Fundamentally, there's enough chemistry between Mallory and Harry that the pages turn.  And, unlike many romantic suspense novels where you simply want to skip the suspense pages, Adler writes a engrossing who dunnit.  The writing isn't top-notch but it goes down easy.  It was good enough to be a nominee for Romantic Times Romantic Suspense book of the year.  A good book for reading at the beach or when you're home sick with a cold.	2001-04-13

That results in some very dated language (&quot;cool cat&quot;) which can be funny.  The fun part of it is that this story revolves around interior decorating and the late 60's must have been one of the wierdest periods for decorating ever.<br />The fundamentals of this book are vintage Braun.  Qwill's mustache twitches, KoKo drops clues in the form of hairballs and it's all done with a minimum of gore.  My only grievence is that Braun is a bit heavy handed with the forshadowing and I guessed who did it awfully early on.	2001-04-12

Seth is an understandably troubled hero and Pippa has some very real demons.  I enjoyed the growing romantic chemistry between them.  <br />The side plots are where this book stumbles.  The story about his son works quite well and keeps this from being just another cookie-cutter book about a trouble boss saved by a charming assistant.  What I found to be utterly gratuitous was the whole evil threats/bombing aspects.  This seems to be a real trend in 1990's romances.  It seems to be something of a cop-out when the really tough thing to write about is the growth of the relationship.<br />Bottom-line: A pleasant read but not a book I'll be keeping or lending to friends.	2001-04-11

That's what happened last night.  It was less than 12 hours from library checkout to completion.  In fairness, I'm already a huge fan of Stephen White's Alan Gregory series.  Still, number nine is a dandy and will hopefully bring him the upper eschelon sales he richly deserves.  The double-edged sword of that wish is that this may not be the best book for a first time reader of the series.  I strongly recommend reading this series in order as the underlying subplots concerning Alan and Lauren (girlfriend/wife) and others evolve in each book.  <br />The editorial reviews do a nice job of summarizing the plot.  This isn't the first time that White has backseated Gregory for another central character (see Higher Authority).  Once again, it's a courageous move that works.  Kristen/Katherine/Peyton is a strong character and Carl Luppo, retired assassin, is nothing short of fascinating.<br />The half-star reduction is for the relatively serious tone of the book.  One of the reasons I love the Alan Gregory series is the underlying humor, most of which is poked directly at us Coloradans.  There's a hint of it when Luppo, in trying to dress anonymously Colorado style, puts on a Rockies windbreaker and a Broncos baseball cap.  Talk about clashing.  Still, there used to be many more of these moments.<br />Bottom-line:  Existing fans will enjoy this book immensely.  New fans will still have a good read and will, hopefully, buy lots of the earlier books and make Stephen White the household name he deserves to be.	2001-04-10

There are many impressive and likeable things about this debut novel.  The writing is terrific, particularly the dialogue and Patrick's inner reflections.  There's lots of cynical wit - both dry and humorous.  Lehane makes Patrick a character who the reader cares about - and one that you want to follow into further books in the series.  Likewise, the plot of Boston gang warfare intermingled with Massachuesetts state politics works pretty well.  Lehane also does a terrific job of conveying the atmosphere of many aspects of summertime Boston - most of which are never seen by tourists.<br />Still, I'm debating if I'll continue reading this series as a matter of my personal taste.  Foremost, this is very gritty, hard-boiled stuff and I found it pretty depressing.  Also, I really struggled with the character of Patrick's partner Angie.  I found it hard to empathize with her abusive relationship with her husband.  She also plays second fiddle to Patrick in a way that left me cold.<br />Bottom-line:  A top-notch read for fans of the hard-boiled school of mysteries.  Those of us with more of a taste for cozy mysteries should read with caution.	2001-04-09

Karen Harper does a great job of taking this most improbable piece of history and winding a nifty mystery fiction into the life of young Elizabeth.<br />The strongest part of the book are the characters.  Harper had plenty of material for Elizabeth and makes her come alive.  Bess is both sympathetic and, at times, annoyingly regal.  Her nemisis, known as &quot;she&quot; for much of the book, makes Cruela de Ville look like a PTA president.  She may be a bit overdrawn but is lots of fun (in an evil sort of way).  The supporting cast of Bess' Privy Council work well - with Harper regularly casting doubts on whether one or more are spies for Mary.<br />The pacing moves well and kept me turning pages (well, turning tapes as I listened to the unabridge audio version).  Bottom-line: a fun historical mystery series that I'm eager to read more of soon.	2001-04-07

I suspected I was in for a great read when Romantic Times picked this as Lowell's best book in their list of the 200 greatest books since 1981.  It was better than that.<br />Start with two protagonists with exotic backgrounds.  Caitlin (the male protagonist) is a former CIA agent who infiltrated Vietmam after the fall of Saigon.  Lindsay is the child of Chinese missionaries who witnessed the brutality of the early days of Mao.  She's now a museum curator specializing in ancient Chinese artificats.<br />The plot revolves around a missing Chinese bronze sculpture which is rumored to be in the San Francisco.  Caitlin and Lindsay are trying to find it, as are the FBI, the PRC and assorted other dangerous parties.  (Keeping track of all these players and their motivations makes this an unusually challenging read for a romance.)  There's lots of lurking in the corners of Chinatown and relatively little of tourist San Francisco (a good thing in my opinion).<br />But the real reason to read this book is the chemistry between Caitlin and Lindsay.  It's hotter than the best Hunan food in San Francisco and will warm up your dreams.  <br />My only gripe about the book -- the name Caitlin made me think of sweet little girls, not a studly guy.  Oh well.	2001-04-07

I still enjoy the magazine but these books are great for those nights when you want to do something different with the chicken (or whatever).  <br />After four months, I doubt this will be my most used volume.  CL has gotten a bit fancier each year and I still turn to earlier volumes when I want a light version of everyday fare.  What's really missing from this book (or their internet site) is a five star index.  The book includes indexes for name, main ingredients and order of appearance.  My wish -- an index by cuisine since I love Asian food.<br />Bottom line: Not necessarily a book for dieters but a good resource for people seeking to eat and live in a healthy manner.	2001-04-04

Crombie updates that idea by making her house a time-share retreat.  Our hero, Duncan Kincaid, has been given a week and finds himself sharing more than cocktails with the eclectic group of guests.<br />This is a pleasant, well paced read.  There aren't any huge surprises or novel concepts.  It's not a surprise that virtually every one of the guests has a secret or two.  And the reader knows from the start that one of the guests must be the killer.  Still, Crombie did a nice job of keeping me guessing.  While the book isn't a page turner, it is an entertaining read.<br />I read this book mostly because it's the first in the Kincaid/James series that achieved a MacCavity award and Agatha and Edgar nominations for the fifth book in the series - Dreaming of Bones.  I expect to enjoy the three books in between as I work my way to the award winning book.	2001-04-04

I barely made it through &quot;Tularosa&quot; (way too gory for the drive to Santa Fe with my 70 something mother).  &quot;Mexican Hat&quot; was an improvement, with great atmosphere but a less than memorable plot.  In &quot;Serpent Gate&quot;, everything comes together.  There's lots of New Mexico (and Santa Fe in particular) for atmosphere.  More importantly, there are a pair of interesting plots: the murder of a small town cop whose background isn't pretty; and a major art theft by Kerney's nemesis from Tularosa - DeLeon.  Frosting on the cake are a couple of interesting side players including Kerney's landlord/host Fletcher.  <br />McGarrity uses an interesting contrast in writing styles.  In the murder case, the reader is left in the dark and stumbles right along with Kerney.  Meanwhile, the reader is the fly on the wall for all of DeLeon's planning in the art theft and the subsequent events.  <br />Bottom line:  A throughly enjoyable romp -- particularly if you're fond of Santa Fe (one of my favorite places).	2001-04-03

Several years and many lists later, I finally got around to reading the book.  I guess I'd expected something staid and hard to relate to.  Was I ever wrong.  This is a really fun and entertaining read. <br />The strong part for me is Rei, our 27 year old half Japanese, half caucasian, slueth.  She's witty and with it -- reminded me a little of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum.  Her romance with the Scot, Hugh, is plenty sexy and fun too.  As for the foreigness of the atmosphere, Massey does a nice job of holding an American reader's hand while providing lots of information and sense of place.  My only regret is that I read the other reviewers and most of the Japanese residents have many complaints about this aspect of the book -- it worked for me.<br />Bottom line - a fun new sassy heroine in an interesting setting.  I'm eager to read more in this series and only wish it was on tape so my husband could listen to it.	2001-04-03

I like to read my mysteries in series.  &quot;Gallows View&quot; is where it begins.<br />Banks and his family have moved from London to a small town in Yorkshire.  They're settling in well when a Peeping Tom case complicates Bank's life.  To appease the local feminists, an attractive female psychologist is asked to consult.  Enter the human side of Banks -- struggling with temptations.  Then a series of burglaries escalates into murder in a neighborhood called &quot;Gallows View.&quot;  It may be a small town but it certainly isn't boring.  <br />I read this book in a day.  The writing is tight, the characters were genuine and the mysteries developed nicely.  Robinson is a native of Yorkshire and one gets a nice sense of place.  Fans of Inspectors Morse and Barnaby are likely to enjoy Banks too.	2001-03-31

This book will make you think again about Scandanavian knitting styles.  The book is entirely about textured/patterned single color sweaters -- and they are beautiful.  <br />Lavold, a Swede, has called on Nordic antiquity for a wide variety of intricate and intriguing cabled patterns.  The resulting charts are both the best and worst aspects of the book.  Basically, I'll keep the book long after the sweaters go out of style because the cable patterns are timeless.  Whether I'll use them often is another question as I find the charting system in this book confusing.  <br />Bottom line:  A nice addition to the library of any knitter interested in textured or aran knititng but not a must.	2001-03-31

There's lots of desert scenery and insights into Native American life.  Unlike other books, this book is focused entirely within the Navajoes but even then we learn that there are 58 clans, 57 who keep Navajo time and then this clan that's slow even by Navajo standards.  Of course, much of the mystery takes place on their turf.  <br />Joe is investigating a variety of backburner cases as an excuse to be in an area where a motorist had nearly hit him.  As he digs deeper, a missing helicopter and an FBI investigation seem to be involved in whatever is going on.  Enter the Dirk Pitt side of Joe's personality.  I won't spoil the surprise but suffice it to say that Joe endures flame, flood and a host of other harrowing experiences as he solves the crime and saves the day.<br />Bottom line: Less religion and culture, more action than the other Hillerman's I've read.  Still, a fun, entertaining read.	2001-03-31

Unfortunately for me, he's a good hunter and we've had at least one elk in our freezer every season for years.  I'm a city girl and this cookbook has been a lifesaver.  The sections on the care and cooking of elk are really useful.  The recipes even taste good (considering it's elk).  The Ragin' Cajun stew has become a mainstay of my winter cooking rotation.  <br />The rest of the cookbook tends towards hearty midwestern fare -- not exactly Cooking Light, but good on those days when comfort food is a priority.	2001-03-31

First, I read the last pages and found out &quot;who dun it.&quot;  Then I read the reviews on this site, many of which complained about the ending and how the author had failed to set it up properly.  So, I had my own game for the final 200 pages - trying to find the clues that would expose who did it.  The reviewers were right -- this ending comes completely out of left field and leaves the reader feeling cheated.<br />All of which is too bad because this book has lots of promise.  The exploration of WW1 shell shock (post-traumatic shock syndrome) in Rutledge is very interesting.  And while other reviews didn't care for the haunting voice of Hamish, the executed soldier/Watson, I enjoyed his blunt ability to see through the blarney.<br />The plotting is a bit slow -- and the redundancies grew a bit old.  Still, I'll probably give the second book in the series a chance.<br />In fairness, someone out there really liked this book (or it came out in a really weak year for first books).  It's on the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association's Top 100 of the Century list.  It was also a nominee for the Dilys, Anthony Best 1st Book and the Edgar Best 1st Novel awards.	2001-03-30
US	48523769	RZ9KQNDFKOY7N	0942018192	285616673	Latvian Dreams, Knitting from Weaving Charts	Books	5	54	54	N	N	Terrific technique section, wonderful charts, pretty designs	First, for those who are not familiar with Joyce Williams, let me offer my humble opinion that she is one of the most inventive knitters alive today.  Joyce has an amazing ability to solve little nagging problems that have been deemed &quot;unsolvable&quot; by the greater universe of knitters.  This book is chock full of these solutions.<br />The first 30-plus pages of the book concern techniques - including a nice write up Joyce's great two needle circular method (no more double pointed needles when knitting socks!!!) This part of the book is worth the price all by itself.<br />The bulk of the book are Joyce's designs for a variety of garments, most of which are knit in the fair isle or stranding tradition.  These are gorgeous garments.  One blessing/caveat -- I was lucky enough to participate in a showing of these garments at Meg Swansen's Knitting Camp and they are very heavy and warm.  It's also important to note that Joyce deliberately leaves out needle sizes and yarn amounts for these patterns.  Why?  Because most of the sizing is accomplished by changing needles and guage.  Her instructions on this are clear but the presentation is likely to be disconcerting for knitters who are used to conventional &quot;blind following&quot; of patterns.<br />The final segment of the book is a terrific collection of charts for stranded or textured knitting.  This is where the &quot;Latvian&quot; aspect figures into the art.  All of these patterns are based on Latvian weaving patterns.  The result is nice group of charts (and resulting knitting) that strongly resembles it's Nordic &quot;cousins&quot; but has its own sort of spice.<br />Bottom-line: An absolute keeper for the technique and charts alone.  Not recommended for novices or beginners who are heavily reliant on patterns.  A wonderful addition for thinking knitters who miss Elizabeth Zimmermann's works.	2001-03-29

They are both late twentysomething white guys who can't quite shed their family and roots.  The locations are different but both are players in the plots.<br />Normally I don't care for Texas settings in novel (it's a Colorado thing) but this one works.  Much of that has to do with Navarre's having spent ten years in the Bay Area (where the writer, Riordan, a Texas native, lives).  It's a nice mixture of cravings for Peet's coffee while drinking Big Red soda cut with tequila.  Navarre is a pretty likeable guy - and is the first guy shamus with a cat that I can recall.<br />The mystery is only worth three stars as it is a bit muddled and has a few too many players.  Still, a fun read and I'm looking forward to the second book in the series, The Widower's Two Step.  It should also be noted that the book won Anthony and Shamus awards as well as making the Washington Post year-end list.	2001-03-27

It's not an easy thing to do, but it works quite well here.<br />I enjoyed this book more than the first book.  Carlotta is growing as a character and was easier to warm up to.  I also got a kick out of Barnes' take on the prep school scene -- having visited more than a few in my days as an admission director for a liberal arts college.  <br />The book is a little out of balance -- she's also on a case to get her buddy, Mooney, of the hook and his case takes a back seat to the preppie case.  I'm also got a bit tired of the &quot;humorous&quot; interludes involving the remodeling of Carlotta's bathroom.<br />Bottom-line:  An enjoyable read for Carlyle fans but not worth lots of effort if you can't find a copy easily.	2001-03-27

It's well written with interesting characters.  It just isn't quite the masterpiece that the first two Martinelli books are.<br />Much of this book focuses on Kate's personal life crises - Lee has left to recover with a long lost aunt and Kate doesn't know where she stands.  She spends more and more time with Jules, the soon to be step-daughter of her partner, Al Hawkin. (Readers of the previous books will remember the child genius.)  She spends some of the time tracking down a runaway friend of Jules.  In the second half of the book, Jules disappears during a road trip to Seattle.  Still, Kate isn't allowed to participate in the the active search and acts policelike only on the fringes.<br />Bottom-line:  Probably a worthwhile read for existing fans of the series but wouldn't be the best book for starting the Martinelli series (which is terrific overall).	2001-03-26

The &quot;in Death&quot; series is a wonderful exception -- occurring, no doubt in part, due to the track record of writer Nora Roberts.  Aren't we lucky to have something so unusual as a mix of mystery/romance/science fiction and have it be a fun read.<br />This is the first book in the popular series.  I've read a few of the others and wish I'd read this one first.  The mystery in each book stands alone but this book explains a great deal about what motivates Eve Dallas.  It's also fun to read about how she and Rourke get together (even if he's far more overbearing than most real women would stand).	2001-03-24

I keep hoping that she'll produce another masterpiece.  &quot;Just Once&quot; isn't it.<br />This book is simply a little to predictible (or maybe I've read too many novels with this plot).  A woman in distress is saved by a man who, in spite of himself, falls for her.  She makes a fool of herself trying to be useful, which she's never been in her pampered life.  Jemma and Hunter are likeable but hardly memorable.<br />Though it's not advertised as part of a trilogy, it appears that this is the second in a series of related books - Daydreamer would be the first and Blue Moon the third.	2001-03-24

Those who expected a detailed yet page turning book such as &quot;The Alienist&quot; were very disappointed.  Just because they are set in around the turn of the century, does not mean they are similar.  Those who approach this book as a literary fiction with mystery flavoring (think Perez-Reverte or Pairs) are more likely to find the book to be what they expected.  If nothing else, the fact that it's a trade paperback (not a mass-market paperback) and that it has a reading group guide should alert you to the other than a typical mystery character of The Fig Eater.<br />That being said, in many ways I got what I expected out of this book.  I selected it because of the setting in 1910 Vienna.  Shields does an impressive job of conveying a strong sense of time and place in this novel.  It's easy to draw pictures in your head of a city that has one hand in modernizing Europe and the other hand in its Hungarian/Gypsy heritage.  The food descriptions are fabulous.<br />Unfortunately, the plot suffers for the abundance of detail.  The pacing is slow.  Likewise, while the main characters are described in detail, they didn't grow on me.  There was something clinical instead of warm about them.<br />Bottom line -- this isn't a pure entertainment mystery but if you are interested in turn of the century central Europe, a book you may want to consider.	2001-03-23

This story revolves around the death of a movie star and has a kind of glitz that doesn't seem to be so popular these days.  (Maybe it's just because I haven't read a Judith Krantz or Sidney Sheldon novel since those days.)  All the same, it's a solid potboiler with glamorous players in beautiful settings (highrise Manhattan and a spa near Pebble Beach).  Fun, light reading.<br />I liked Elizabeth Ashley's reading on the abridged audiocassette.  Her gravel edged voice (think Lauren Bacall) is pleasant for my ear and she did a good job of character voices.  The abridgement followed well and it was pretty easy to keep track of all of the players -- most of whom could be the murderer.	2001-03-23

Maybe the editors chose to leave all of the gorey, grusome aspects of the book in the abridgement and deleted the &quot;normal&quot; stuff.  <br />In all events, my husband (a former policeman/army officer) didn't seem to mind the gore and maybe you won't either.  It reminded me a great deal of some of the recent Cornwell efforts in terms of the kinky, bloody aspects.<br />Still, we both found the taped abridgement to be choppy and confusing.  One can only hope that the paper version lacks these problems.	2001-03-21

Not a good thing and it gets worse when Rostnikov determines that one of the victims is an American investigative journalist.  Further digging brings in the KGB, an international terrorist brigade and more deaths.  And, as expected, Rostnikov and his assistants, work in and around the system to solve the crime(s).<br />I enjoyed this story a great deal though not as much as the first book - Death of a Dissident.   What I like most about the Rostnikov series is how a generic, could happen anywhere, crime story is altered when seen through Soviet eyes.  Dissident was a 100% Soviet story and that was part of it's charm.  The introduction of a number of international players in this book somehow blurs the distinctiveness of the earlier book.<br />As the child of a WW2 veteran, I'm also struck by how Rostnikov, also a WW2 vet, has some of the same &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; traits.  Somehow this is a group that is both patriotic yet willing to work outside of the system if the system gets in the way of, say, fixing a toilet.  Read the book and you'll understand.	2001-03-20

And you're still hungry for mysteries set in the 1920's.  This book is probably worth an evening.  It's not a mesmerizing as the greats but is still a solid cozy with a likeable,'liberated' (for that era) heroine.  The pacing is pretty slow.  <br />Also, after reading Airth's &quot;River of Darkness&quot; which is also set in post-WWI England, this story seems a little shallow.  It's one thing for a book written in those times not to include modern concepts.  It seems somewhat strange to see a 1990's book without a touch of psychology.	2001-03-17

If this book was fictional, you'd say it was too impossible to be true.  But it is true.  The story is the book.  Shackelton and his men endure almost two years of amazing danger and hardship.  You can read some of the other 200 plus reviews for details.<br />I haven't read any of the other versions of this story.  I'm just glad that somehow a 1959 book found it's way back to the lists of books to read.  Is it dated?  Possibly.  I can only suspect that Lansing sugarcoats some of the tensions that surely existed.  However, unlike more recent versions, there were still living survivors of the party at that time.  The book benefits from Lansing's ability to interview them but one suspects that he also edited the book to honor their sensibilities.<br />Bottom-line:  Don't complain about your heating bills or not being able to decide what to wear until you've read this powerful tale.	2001-03-17

For no particular reason, I expected a meaty, challenging read - something along the lines of Smiley or Hamilton.  What I found was a much more simple book that left me unsatisfied.  The writing is correct and the fundamental story is one worth telling.  Still, there are lots of loose ends in the story.  The most frustrating part is the end where it seems to me the story is just starting.  What was life like with Jay back in their lives?  What could they resume and what was irrevocably changed?<br />Bottom line -- an easy read with some thought provoking elements.  Still, it is so straight forward that my book group ran out of things to talk about in the book after only 30 minutes.	2001-03-13

There's just about as little violence as you can have while still having a murder.  The story centers around a small group of diverse characters, in this case a vacation fishing school class.  And, this book introduces a slueth, Hamish MacBeth, who makes Columbo look like a millionaire.  The victim, Lady Jane, has made everyone (including you, the reader) ready to kill her with her evil inuendos.  But who did it?<br />Anyhow, a solid read for a snowy day with a cup of cocoa.

In the first part, our heroine, Olivia, is so ignorant that she makes herself miserable.  In the second part, she's so dumb and angry that she makes herself miserable.  I spent the better part of the book wanting to do something that would make her wake up - figuratively.  It doesn't help that I found Spencer to be a self-centered unsympathetic character.  Somehow, his noble misery just annoyed me.<br />I'm bummed I didn't like this book.  The Door County setting held a great deal of promise.<br />In fairness, someone out there liked this book.  It won a Reviewer's Choice award from Romantic Times.  It was also garnered a five star review in The Romance Reader.

I suspect this book would be tough to enjoy without reading the opening book of the series - Until Proven Guilty - first.  So much of this book involves recovery from the events of the first book.<br />The mystery in this book is solid enough - a mix of electoral and parole board politics and money.	2001-02-26

Some days I can do it, other days I can't.  Fortunately, I read this in a good mood and was able to enjoy it (tho I swear I never watched the Dukes of Hazzard).  The characters are caricatures of southern small town life.<br />Still, it's only a three star effort in my book.  The mystery component is rather weak - certainly not a page turning suspense novel.

It had great courtroom tension, changing suspects and lots of suspense.  This was a good thing because more than once the dialouge was so stilted and cliche that I found myself wincing.<br />This is fundamentally a book about lawyers (for better or for worse).  Every key character is either a lawyer or has a life that is entwined with the legal system.  It isn't always a pretty picture.  Almost all of the characters come off as some sort of obsessive personality.  Interesting, yes; sympathetic, not really.<br />Still, you keep wondering who killed the supreme court law clerk and, then a month later, the Oregon Supreme Court justice.  Are the killings related?  There are more than a few great theories and line between the obvious and the sublime is very sketchy.<br />Bottom line:  an entertaining read that will tickle your thinking process without challenging it too hard.	2001-02-23

This book, written in 1972, introduces Jacqueline Kirby, a middle aged librarian with more than a few eccentricities.  It's set in Rome, where Kirby befriends a group of graduate fellows.  One of the students dies suspiciously in the catacombs.  What follows is a mixed of locked room mystery (one of the seven students must have done the deed) and lots of early Christian archeology/history.<br />Overall, the book has a bit of a dated tone.  It reminded me of the Disney interpretations of Mary Stewart's mysteries.  There's nothing wrong with the tone, it's just a bit different.  Also, I've read later books in this series and Kirby evolves into a much wittier sleuth in later volumes.  In other words, Peters hasn't quite found her wonderful, sarcastic wit in this book.  Still, a solid cozy of a read.	2001-02-14

But when the car teenager Tricia &quot;borrowed&quot; is identified in a drive by shooting, all the evidence points to her despite her denials.  Her mother and inspector Goldstein believe her and investigate further into the victim's strange boarding house and habits.  Goldstein's partner keeps focusing on Tricia.  The victim is universally hated in the neighborhood but alternatives to Tricia are hard to find.  <br />I read this book primarily because 1) it won a MacCavity for best first novel in 1987 (in a tie with Faye Kellerman - who has gone on to fame and fortune)and 2) it's set in Oakland, my hometown.  I find the award perplexing as this simply isn't all that great a book.  The author can't seem to settle on a protagonist and 180 pages is too little time for any of the characters to emerge as interesting or sympathetic.  Overall, the story is flat and fractured.  Likewise, it lacks humor and warmth.  The Oakland angle is also disappointing.  She barely works it as a setting and what she does use is strictly guidebook level.  Janet Dawson's series is much more interesting if you happen to be interested in Oakland (don't laugh).<br />Bottom line -- doubt I'll be reading the remaining two books in this series.	2001-02-13

While I had forgotten much of the mystery plot (not unusual for me), the insights into Mormonism really stuck with me.  I reread the book this week (so I could chat with my husband, a first time reader) and came away even more impressed.<br />Having spent considerable time in Utah, I find the exploration of the LDS church in this book fascinating. I'm a bit of a religious skeptic and probably share some of White's biases.  Still, this book strikes me as being carefully researched and jives with what I already knew of the life in Utah.  It's a tremendous education about a part of America that is rarely explored in fiction (or elsewhere).<br />The other outstanding feature of this book is that it focuses on Lauren Crowder, Alan Gregory's girlfriend.  As I mentioned in an earlier review, this really is a series that should be read in order (if possible).  This is the third book in the series.  I admire White's courage in backseating Gregory.  Lauren is an interesting character and lends a different (more serious) tone to this book.  Still, I can see that this is a bit of a curve ball for what some readers may expect.  So -- you're forwarned now - enjoy it.<br />Oh, yes, the mystery.  There is one and it's ok.  Actually, it reminds me a bit of some of the earlier Grisham books.  It's probably the weakest part of the book but good enough that you won't want to put the book down towards the end.	2001-02-12

Having entering the Bay Area legal scene a year after Susan Wolfe, I can vouch for the authenticity of Howard Rickover's angst.  Yes, partners do dump projects on your desk that can't be billed and then chastise you for not having enough billable hours.  No, partners generally don't get murdered in their offices.<br />Anyhow, the mystery aspect of this book is adequate but the sense of life and greed in the 1980's legal world is very real.  I left the law in 1989 - can only hope that things are better.<br />My notes indicate this book won an Edgar for best first novel.  I can't find any hint of sequel.  Wolfe must have had to get her billable hours back up	2001-02-10

Indeed, I found myself liking Jenny a good deal more in this book than in some of the others.  She displays a charming dry wit that I really enjoyed.<br />This book sets up the earmarks of the series.  For me, a westerner, the clearest distinction is the strong sense of New England that permeates this book and series.  Not that it is a foreign country, but certainly it is its own place.  It's also fun to get insights on how foundations work -- a setting I haven't seen in other books.<br />Bottom line -- a debut book that is a good read in its own right.	2001-02-10

Stephanie Plum, Alan Gregory, and others always bring a smile to my face.  Now I can add Didius Falco.  What is different is that his snide remarks are 1,930 years old  and concern things like going to that barberic land called Britain where, heaven forbid, it's so cold you have to wear socks.<br />I happen to love fictional history so this is a great match of mystery and history.  I learned more about the Roman Empire under Vespesian than I've learned since college.  And it wasn't just politics--- the book includes a good sense of everyday life.  Did you know that urine was used as bleach?<br />There's also a dandy mystery with complicated webs of politics and greed and murder to be solved.  Didius has a few missteps but ultimately has the moxy to unravel the tangled mess.<br />My only quibble is a modest one.  I listened to the unabridged tapes.  The narration is in first person, past tense which is ok.  Unfortunately, the narrator has the voice of a fifty/sixty year old man.  This made it a little hard to visualize a 29 year old Falco (particularly in some of the more romantic moments).<br />Bottom line - a series I'm eager to continue reading for the clever mystery plotting, the engaging main characters and the history lessons.	2001-02-09

Indeed, I am wondering what the fuss is about this author -- but I'll give him another try -- someday.<br />So what's wrong (or right) about this book?  Basically, I realized about half way into the book that I really didn't like any of the the characters.  Part of the problem is that there are way too many characters so there's no chance to develop a sympathetic protagonist (or even a crook).  The book also bounces around between all of these people and lacks any sense of flow.	2001-02-09

On a ship with less than 200 people (and 15 tons of gold) there's only so many places to look for a murder.  Still, Alex and Jessie have quite a search on their hands as sub-plots emerge.  Periodic, anonymous conversations by the bad guys only add to the suspense.  The final 20% of the book has lots of action (and remarkably little blood).<br />The use of the scenery is both a strong and weak point in the book.  This series is a favorite because I enjoy the armchair traveling experience of going to Alaska in the books.  Maybe it was having to listen to every word on tape, but the traveloge was a bit too much in this book.<br />Finally, make sure to read the author's notes.  This book is based on a real ship and a real anniversary sailing.  Lots of real people are used as characters which is fun.	2001-02-07

Basically, it's really difficult to like Marian, the heroine.  She does lots of stupid things.  She's not helped by the author who only reveals her motivation at the end of the book, long after I'd ceased to care about Marian.  <br />Griffith isn't much better.  I've been reading romances for decades and remember the bodice rippers with fondness.  Still, he treads an awfully fine line between seduction and rape.  <br />Finally, as a big fan of Josephine Tey's &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot;, I was really annoyed with the blind following of Dodd in her treatment of Richard III.  Tey's book very convincingly states that Richard's reputation is not deserved and that the propaganda that created the reputation didn't start until many years after this book was written.	2001-02-06

It deserves all of that recognition.  Why?  Because Airth has managed to combine some of the best of the classic British mystery (the aura of Dame Agatha lurks) with some of the most interesting aspects of newer detective fiction - psychology and post war trauma.<br />I'm looking forward to the promised sequel -- as the characters have lots of room for growth.  It's also a great time period for exploration.<br />Least you think this is a cozy, please be aware that in Pike, Airth has created a portrait of evil that will make you sure that your doors are locked and you're on your guard.<br />Bottom line -- a very good read for fans of historical mysteries (Caleb Carr, Anne Perry)or British police procedurals.	2001-02-03

Who would publish a book that has an expatriate Englishman trying to unearth the secrets of a dead Greek in sites including Turkey, Sofia, Athens, Geneva and Paris.  Yet that is a huge part of what makes this book so special.  It is a very &quot;continental&quot; tale.  For me as a reader, it's the difference between great French cuisine and McDonalds.<br />There's also the inevitable time difference.  Even though the book focuses on much of the underbelly of life, it does so with an eloquent voice of its time.  It's hardly a cozy, but the suspense is a product of thought and atmosphere - not gadgets and gore.<br />This review is based on the unabridged audiotapes which are a treat with lots of different accents.  Since much of the book is told as a series of verbal stories about Dimitrios, it seems all the more appropriate for them to be heard as stories.<br />So, tired of modern cookie cutter mysteries and thrillers?  Treat yourself to this classic and be transported to another world.	2001-01-31

If the five stories chosen for the audiobook are the best of the thirteen stories in the unabridged book, then I fear the reader is in for a dull time of it.  At least readers like myself, who want a little more meat than short stories deliever.  The stories are pretty typical of what you expect from Christie - rather civilized criminals who are found out by one minor slip.<br />I only read this because I'm trying to read the Miss Marple series in order.  My advice to others, persue this book if you like mystery short stories, otherwise don't worry about checking it off your list.	2001-01-31

Unfortunately, the actual reading of this book was a disappointment.<br />Here's my guess on what happened.  Take a New York writer, a New York editor and a New York publisher.  Someone forgot that some of the readers might not know or care about every last corner and building in New York City.  Hence, many incredibly detailed descriptions were allowed to stay in the book that should have gone to the cutting room floor.  <br />The first 250 pages of this book were painfully slow for me.  At least the final 100 pages had both action and philosophy and read smoothly.<br />Bottom line -- probably a good book for those who know and love Manhattan.  As for the rest of us, I'm sure better books of time-travel and mystery and romance are out there.	2001-01-31

This story is the heart of the book -- as J.D. has progresses in his relationships with the children in fits and starts.  Sometimes the fits were a bit much -- particularly in the case of Caleb who went from a simpathetic to simply annoying character (but then again, he's an adolescent and it is probably true to life.)<br />The romance with Kelsey takes a back seat in this book.  It also didn't ring quite true for me.<br />Bottom line -- this book is a good read for the fans of &quot;small towns can heal whatever is ailing you&quot; plot lines.  I enjoyed it enough that I'll probably track down the two previous books in the Bethlehem series(as soon as I figure out the titles).	2001-01-30

Yet I really, really enjoyed Kendrick - a twelfth century ghost with a Jag in the garage (who cares if he can't drive it) and a passion for American football.  The first two hundred pages of this book are a delight.  Genevieve inherits Kendrick's castle and he goes from trying to scare her to death to falling in love with her.  I consider myself a grounded, logical person but I had no problem suspending disbelief for this part of the story.<br />Ironically, it's the next hundred pages when a human problem of Genevieve's becomes the obstacle that I wanted to throw the book across the room.  Her &quot;problem&quot; was beyond believing for me.<br />Still, this has some potential as a keeper simply because Kendrick is one of the most enchanting heroes I've encountered in the last year.  He kind of makes you want to have a ghost of your own.	2001-01-28

I'm sure that with 200+ reviews, a reader can get a good sense of the substance of the book.  I'd like to put in my vote for the tape.  <br />First, the tape is narrated by the author.  Usually, this is a disaster.  Indeed, Cisneros has a high pitched voice that probably wouldn't work for most books.  However, in evoking the voice of the child/woman, Esperanza, her voice seems just right.  And, since this book is a memoir, she can convey the emotion in a true fashion.<br />The other treat is the introduction.  I don't know if this is in later editions of the printed page version. On the tape, Cisneros tells of the writing of the book and the public's reaction.  It's a powerful five minutes.<br />The stories vary.  The strongest message for my middle aged anglo ears was the amazing commonality in growing up female in the USA - wanting nylons, not being sure about boys - in spite of ethnic and class differences.	2001-01-24

In a real world of love matches followed by divorce, the world of fiction has arranged marriages followed by love.  I'm actually rather partial to this formula in fiction and this is a good example of it.  Indeed, it is good enough for a Rita and selection by Romantic Times as one of the 200 best romances written since 1980.<br />Unlike some other reviewers, this book didn't move me to tears or knock my socks off.  It's a good read with some steamy love scenes.  What distinguishes the book from others is the setting -- 1157 to 1161 Wales - when King Henry is trying to conquer the Welsh.  This is a political marriage of a Norman knight and the daughter of the Welsh king.  As a result, the usual &quot;I don't like you because you're a Norman&quot; tension is much more complex and ultimately complicating than the typical romance written about this period.	2001-01-24

It's a solid enough mystery.  The historical and geographic settings make for very interesting reading.  We both started out knowing virtually nothing about the atomic bomb project.  We now know much more of the history and personalities of the projects -- even if we are still clueless on the science.<br />Where we diverged strongly in opinion concerned the romance between Mike and Emma.  My husband says that &quot;it's the stuff of guy fantasies.&quot;  As the daughter of WW2 era parents, my reaction was that the romance was just that -- such a fantasy that it interfered with my ability to enjoy the story.  I just can't buy Emma's promiscuity in the context of what I know of women during those years.<br />So, three stars from me and five stars from my husband = four stars.	2001-01-24

Even for beginners, the lack of shaping (armholes, etc.) allows for a project that can be elegant when finished and is often deceptively easy to make.  Shawls are in the fashion news and Cheryl Oberle's book couldn't be timed better.<br />This is primarily a pattern book.  Cheryl's designed 25 terrific rectangles, squares and triangles drawing upon international traditions (and her own imagination).  She includes a brief history of the tradition as an introduction to each shawl.  The photography is wonderful.  As for Cheryl being the model, the story (straight from Cheryl's mouth) is that Cheryl was demonstrating how to wear the shawls to the model.  The photographer said that there was no way the model would ever wear the shawls as gracefully as Cheryl -- hence Cheryl the model.<br />My only reservation on this book is that it's light on technique.  There's a small opening segment with everything one needs to know for the book.  But, if you aren't looking to make one of the shawls, this isn't the sort of book you're likely to use as a reference or source of inspiration for your own designs.<br />Skill range -- advanced beginner to expert.	2001-01-23

This is a beautiful and BIG book - coffee table size and 174 pages.<br />The most astounding thing about this book is the amazing range of projects offered within the theme of lace.  Just among the shawls offered there are: 3 triangles, 2 rectangles, 8 circles, 2 faroese and 3 squares.  Then there are garments ranging from shrugs and tunics (6) to socks (3) and a christening gown.  Then, just for grins, is Debbie New's lace boat (I kid you not!)<br />As for the skill levels required, there are a few projects for solid beginners.  (The actual knitting of lace isn't difficult -- it's the keeping track of where you are in the pattern that is the trick.)  Most of the projects are best suited to knitters with some experience with lace.  <br />Beyond the patterns, there's a good techniques section in the introduction.  There's also a gallery of lace projects where the designer doesn't have a written pattern available but it has some fun ideas (including the boat).  There's also a section with a message from each designer.  The book concludes with a section about the making of the book - coordinating 30 designers, photographing garments on several continents (and the photos are stunning).  What a project for Meg Swansen to coordinate.<br />Bottom line -- a gorgeous book of patterns but with enough technique and design that you can use it as a reference too.	2001-01-23

She left knitters a huge legacy including four wonderful books.  I own all four, and this is my favorite.<br />First, I really enjoy the autobiography woven through the book.  From a childhood in England to marriage and children in the USA, it's a very interesting story.  For the career minded, it's a wonderful tale of a cottage industry grown on talent, charm and hard work.<br />This book also includes several of my favorite &quot;patterns&quot;.  For those unfamiliar with EZ, a word of caution.  The greatest of Elizabeth's accomplishments (IMHO), was her rebellion against blind following of patterns.  Sure, you could make exact duplicates of her sweaters, but where's the fun in that?  Elizabeth teaches (and writes patterns) in terms of concepts and thinking.  The result -- patterns that can be adapted for different weights of yarn and different bodies.  So, in this book are &quot;instructions&quot; for a beautiful Norwegian sweater; the classic shetland wool, fair isle neck sweater so popular in the 70's; the mocassin sock (easy to reknit when heels and toes wear out); the &quot;Pi-R&quot; shawl; and the great mobieus scarf (think the infinity circle).<br />If you have the chance, the video series that accompanies this book (for a series of PBS shows as I recall) is also a treat.  Schoolhouse Press produces them (don't know if Amazon carries them).<br />Bottom line:  Not a book for the novice knitter but a wonderful addition to the library of any person who can no longer remember how many times they've said &quot;just let me finish this row.&quot;	2001-01-22

I'm lucky enough to fall into both categories.  So, one minute I enjoy the chatter about worsted weight versus sport weight yarn and in another moment, I laugh out loud at the discussion of &quot;hot dishes&quot;  (called casseroles by the rest of us in the USA).<br />Ferris is improving with each episode.  In this book, Betsy keeps having scary &quot;accidents&quot; and can't figure out why someone would be out to get her.  We, the readers, know of course. It's fun to follow the twists and turns as Betsy figures out what's up.  Catching the culprit is almost an anti-climax.<br />A fun read with lots of snow and Christmas for atmosphere.  Now, if they'd only produce the series on audio-tape so I could knit and &quot;read&quot; at the same time!	2001-01-21

I finally read Heart of the Sea last night and enjoyed this light read immensely.  <br />What makes this book work?  For starters, while some of the other reviewers didn't care for it, I rather like the unabashed ambition of Darcy and Trevor.  Materialism isn't always a good thing but at least these two are honest about it and hence their characters have some motivation.  I also felt some genuine romantic tension between the two.<br />I also felt that the Garrick and Gwen sub-plot actually worked in this book, whereas it had only annoyed me in the first two books.<br />Bottom-line:  Not great literature but a solid, predictible read.  Enjoy the Irish atmosphere and six likeable main characters and don't worry too much about how things will turn out.	2001-01-20

(Murder on a Girl's Night Out is the first in the series.)  Once again, being sixty-something and retired in Alabama is looking to be lots of fun and a little bit dangerous.<br />This time the sisters get involved in a death at an art gallery featuring &quot;outsider&quot; art (think quilts, primitive oils, etc.)  The book is strong on humor, sisterly chat (and teasing), winter in Birmingham and teacher love.  The mystery is pretty weak -- particularly the conclusion which both comes out of nowhere and is way too convenient.<br />Bottom line -- a fun, light read of the cozy kind.  As another reviewer mentioned about Anne George, it's nice to find an author that you can recommend to your senior citizen mother.	2001-01-19

Note that the title is slightly different -- including the word &quot;creative.&quot;  Indeed, this is probably the most intriguing, but least likely to be knitted, collection of the three books.  The collection has four basic parts:<br />1. Knit/purl patterns -- simple you think.  However, the average row repeat in this group is about 16 rows and several patterns go over 30 rows and over a dozen stitches.  Pretty to look at, hard to memorize.<br />2. 20 pages of slip stitch/multicolor stitches, primarily mosaic stitches.  These aren't as hard as they look, but tend to create a heavy fabric.<br />3. 16 pages of Cross Stitch/Twist Stitch patterns. Again, not as hard as they look -- cable effect without cable needles in most cases.<br />4. 34 pages of complicated cables.  These are the eye candy of the book -- lots of fun to look at, though more complex than the average knitter is likely to use regularly.<br />So, aside from the substance, why buy this book.  As with volumes 2 and 3, the color photography is wonderful if you're looking for ideas.  As for picking this volume over the others, the biggest distinction is that this is the only one of the three books that uses charts (all three have written instructions).  For those of us who are partial to knitting in the round, this is terrific.  The charts are not written in the standard &quot;magazine&quot; symbol system and that takes a bit of adjustment.<br />As with my review of the other Harmony books, I urge others to check out the Barbara Walker treasuries.  The photography is only in black and white but on the whole I find them easier to use when the needles are in my hands.	2001-01-19

I, quite honestly, am baffled as to what is in this novel to make it stand out and deserve this treatment.  There are many other romances which are much more deserving.<br />Not that this is a bad read - it's just a predictible, formula novel.  It includes many cliche plot twists - trapped by a snow storm in a cabin, hero who doesn't think he deserves to be loved, etc.  As a Bay Area native (with four grandparents who all remembered the 1906 earthquake vividly), the history is pretty shakey also.  Likewise, while I'm not a fan of any malicious characters, this book has two sources of threats.  One is reasonably necessary for the plot but the other one is simply annoying.<br />Bottom line -- not a waste of time but hardly extraordinary.	2001-01-18

We both came away disappointed with this installment.  The problem is pretty basic.  In the other books in this series, the mystery is the core of the book and the setting is the frosting on the cake.  The mix is seriously reversed in this book, which is fine if you really want to learn about the Aluetian Islands.  It's not so hot if you want a page turning mystery.  <br />Bottom line -- if you really like reading your mysteries in order, this is worth reading since the horrors of the crab boat are referred to often in later books.  Otherwise, don't go out of your way to find this book.	2001-01-17

The hippies, Watergate, Vietnam were very real but the writing of the times often doesn't hold up well.  This book is a nice exception.<br />Dance Hall of the Dead is one of the earliest of the Leaphorn/Chee series.  In many ways it sets up (and epitomizes) the formula that has made this books so popular.  Leaphorn (and Chee) is both a Navajo and an everyman.  The mystery will lead to encounters with the white culture and another southwestern Native American culture -- in this case the Zuni's.  And yes, there will be a serious dose of southwestern history, culture and spirituality.  And, in the case of this book and many others, the case will be solved due to some violation of a cultural taboo by a bad guy outside of that culture.  The pacing will be that of the southwest -- a mellower clock that the coasts operate on.<br />What stands out in this book is the author's insights on the mindsets of teenagers.  More specifically, what happens when the usual teenage angst is complicated by trying to live in multiple cultures as is the case of the missing boy, George.  George is a Navajo, living in modern America with all of its white culture, who wants to be a Zuni.  Ah, youth....	2001-01-12
US	48523769	R1NZYSRKYOPTTP	0553452789	690006310	Well Schooled in Murder	Books	4	7	8	N	N	English prep school murder	Ah, murder at the English public school.  It's practically a mandatory setting for writers of English mysteries.  And while I haven't read all of these books, this certainly is a solid example of this sub-sub-genre.  There are dysfunctional families, odd faculty members and alumni/parent politics.  More importantly there's the school's honor code and then the unwritten but very powerful student code.  (Reminds me of some military academy scandals we've seen in the USA.)<br />In all events, this is a good read assuming the reader is looking for the features of an English mystery - not much gore, a bit of class struggle, a stiff upper lip hiding the passions underneath and such.  Some of the other reviewers said this was boring a read.  I'd counter that the book is what it sets out to be, an exercise of the mind rather than the gun.<br />A note to readers not familiar with Elizabeth George -- this is a series that is well worth reading in order.  The relationship of Lynley and his partner, Havers, is a complex one and grows in each book.  Likewise, the story of St. James, his forensic consultant, doesn't make much sense when read out of order (in my experience).  This is the third book in the series.<br />So, want to settle in for the night and be transported to English school life - this is a good choice.	2001-01-12

It doesn't have much to do with real life but it sure makes for good sexual tension in a novel.  It that sense, this book succeeds completely.<br />What is less successful is the developement of the love aspect.  I agree with other reviewers that the declaration of love on Dom's part seems to happen out of thin air.<br />As for the auxillary plot(s), this one is ok.  I generally am annoyed by the seeming trend to require some sort of &quot;evil&quot; as a catalyst to bring the couple together.  At least this one seems modestly relevant.  It would have been nicer if Dom and Anne simply could have found each other's arms for good reasons -- not out of fear.<br />Bottom line: An ok read, pretty sexy love scenes but not a book that touched me deeply.	2001-01-11

It is definately not a cozy.  With 55 reviews (and counting), I'll let others tell the plot.  <br />What I liked about this book was the snappy pace and the underlying concept of the crime.  What I didn't like was primarily the guns and the gore.  This is not a book for people with weak stomaches or those prone to nightmares.  Likewise, I second the comments of others that there are a few too many convenient coincidences and more than a few unsubstantiated conclusions/deductions that are nagging, tho not fatal flaws.<br />Bottom line:  A good book for readers who like lots of action and good guys take out the bad guys violence.  Not a great book for those who don't like gore or who do need logical sequences.  (I think my husband, a hunter and former MP, who likes to get lost in a book, will enjoy this more than I did.)	2001-01-11

Add the techno-element of a Tom Clancy.  Toss in a dash of the international intrigue of a Robert Ludlum.  Set it on fire-- and you have California Fire and Life.<br />What a treat to find this book.  So many of the &quot;new&quot; Southern California school of mystery writers seem to be the same.  Sure there are elements here - Jack surfs and his girlfriend is a Latina.  But this is a book with a solid driving plot and an interesting angle -- arson.<br />I must admit I started out planning on only four stars for this book because of the sometimes overwhelming detail about the chemistry and physics of fire.  Still the section on fire as a &quot;seduction&quot; is a gem.  However, my husband convinced me that this detail (which he heard on tape and couldn't skim over) was one of the best parts of the book.  Must be a guy thing.<br />So, for those who love the best of the classic elements in mystery/thriller reading but are looking for a refreshing change -- my solid thumb up.	2001-01-10

Well, at least for those of us living in a high-tech society (with time to write review for the internet), the first reaction to this book can be pretty horrifying.  The poverty, the death, the lack of hope, the dung....<br />I am so grateful to my book group for forcing a second look at the book.  As we tried to shed our personal responses we found some interesting things.  For example, though it is an arranged marriage, it's a much stronger and happier marriage than most portrayed in contemporary Western literature.  Indeed, the family is rarely unhappy -- only when on the edge of starvation or other drastic items.  Their lack of possessions doesn't seem to really bother them.  Perhaps a good lesson in Simple Abundance for us all.	2001-01-09

This is probably one of those times, since I generally wouldn't chose an abridged audiobook.  In this case, this editors seemed to have sucked the life out of Ana Grey.  So many of the other reviewers talk about an intriguing new protagonist.  Well, the Ana I heard was boring and a bit whiney.  I just didn't like her.<br />Tape or no tape, the bigger plot is also a bit out there - not the movie star part or the Salvadoran refugees -- just that Ana is related to them.  Smith does a good job of portraying life in Los Angeles north of Montana Ave.<br />So, my advice - read the paper version, if anything.  If you really want a sizzling new writer from So. Cal - try Don Winslow.	2001-01-09

It's still a great addition to a library but if money is tight, you may want to give priority to EZ's other books.<br />This is the book based on the PBS series she did about twenty years ago.  It goes from the very beginning of knitting - how to cast on to some fairly sophisticated color stranding (aka as fair isle).  <br />The bulk of the instructions are pure EZ -- no conventional patterns for her.  Instead she teaches you how to measure the body in a few key places and &quot;design&quot; a sweater based on the proportions indicated by these measurements.  Learning how to THINK like a knitter is an invaluable skill.  And for the faint of heart, more or less conventional directions are provided in an appendix.<br />Some of the patterns are a bit dated but some are classics.  This book includes the famous baby surprise jacket - knit in one rather strange looking glob, a couple of key seams and you have a great baby coat.  There's also a good section on shawls which seem to be back in fashion in 2001.<br />Bottom line:  A good book for your third dozen books as you put together a knitting library.	2001-01-08

It's a theme we don't see often in romance novels.  (I sometimes suspect that there are more nobles in novels than ever existed in real life.)<br />The first two-thirds of the book are devoted to the romance as the two get past some real obstacles to love (class, in love with others and such).  This part of the book works very well.  The final third concerns their involvment in the 100 Years War and the tests that puts on the relationship.  This part is a bit tedious.  It also includes some revelations that are a bit too formulaic for an otherwise original book.<br />Still, I liked the characters a good deal.  Both of them grow in the course of the novel in ways that are believeable and appealing.	2001-01-07

Even advanced beginners can fall in love with a yarn and want to make a scarf or another non-fitted garment with a stitch (or several) that make the work the knitter's own design.<br />So where does this book fit in?  If you're just starting a knitting library, you're probably better off buying one of the &quot;big&quot; knitting how to books (such as Vogue Knitting) which has a section on stitches.  The next step, IMHO, is one (or all three) of Barbara Walker's wonderful stitch treasuries.  The photos are black and white but the instructions are clear.  (And, we just heard on the knit list that a fourth treasury is in the works!).  This book (and it's companion volumes) are a logical next step.  I enjoy them primarily for the excellent color photography.  There are some patterns that are simply much more appealing in color.  <br />As for comparing this book with volumes 2 and 4....  This book is strong on unusual cables and lace patterns.  It also has many pages of slip-stitch and color work.  For shawl and afgan fans, there's a solid section of edgings.<br />Bottom line:  A good reference for knitters looking for the second dozen books in their libraries, but not a must.	2001-01-06

Myron is still a funny guy from New Jersey and the sports angle is still a refreshing change from the typical cast of characters in mysteries.  The sport of the book is tennis and the insights into the pressure and commercialization of the sport were educational.<br />So why not five stars?  This may be a little picky but unlike some of his other books, the end of this book was something I figured out at least one hundred pages out.  Some of the other reviewers complain of his books being &quot;formula.&quot;  Well, one of the formula elements of this series is the complete surprise ending.  I missed it in this book.<br />Bottom line:  Not a must read but a pleasant evening, particularly if you like Myron's humor or tennis.	2001-01-05

Jim Chee, Navajo policeman, is on the scene.  The DEA suspect him of being an accomplice in the drug plane.  The windmill may be a Hopi problem and as far as the Hopis are concerned, Jim might as well be a white man.  As is the case with the rest of this series, Chee solves the crimes with a mix of old fashioned police work and noticing when things supposedly done by Navajos aren't quite in keeping with Navajo culture.<br />I listened to the unabridged tapes and found this a very entertaining read.  The mystery may be a bit slow to unravel but that's because Hillerman takes the time to explore the landscape and culture of the desert southwest.  That may not be everyone's interest but I enjoyed it.<br />For those who try to do things in order, this is the second book featuring Jim Chee (Blessing Way is the first) and the fifth in the Leaphorn/Chee series.	2001-01-04

Fortunately for her, a handsome American who knows the locals says she's his wife and they let her go.  So much for logical opening chapters.<br />Still, this is a fun light read.  Charlie needs the &quot;cover&quot; of a wife while trying to local a missing employee on the island where he grew up.  Penny, an otherwise intelligent woman, thinks she's going to jail if she doesn't go along with Charlie.  It takes awhile for them to uncover the reasons behind the disappearance but the romantic tension grows at a nice pace.  I also appreciated that the protagonists were tall, attractive AND smart.<br />What I really liked about this book is that the author keeps a good balance of humor, romance, and suspense.  Some of the so-called romantic suspense I've read lately has been really dark - violent, kinky sex and otherwise bleak. Rice does a good job of avoiding those traps and the result is a romance with suspense -- just the way I like it.	2001-01-04

The structure is a chapter for each month.  Each chapter is more or less equal parts conversation about knitting in general and then a pattern that is suitable for the month.<br />The real reason to read and reread this book lies in the openings of each chapter.  January talks about guage in aran sweaters.  Sounds technical, right?  Well, Elizabeth (or EZ as many knitters call her) chats with you through the thought process rather than lecturing you.  Later on, EZ opens a discussion of knitting in the dark as follows: &quot;What? You can't knit in the dark?  Stuff and nonsense; anybody can.  Shut your eyes.  Knit one stitch....&quot;  <br />The patterns are a mixed bag.  Some of the adult sweaters look a little dated but the book includes some timeless classics such as the layette and mocassin socks.<br />Finally, at the risk of offending out host (Amazon), be sure to check with EZ's daughter Meg Swansen at Schoolhouse Press before you give up searching for this book.  If anyone would have a stash of them for sale, it would be Meg.	2001-01-03

They travel to an island off the southern coast.  The notes continue.  Of the group on the island, almost all have some reason to hate the actress or want her money.<br />This is a pretty classic closed room mystery in the Agatha Christie mold.  Cordelia is a fairly engaging slueth.  As best I can tell, this is the end of the Cordelia Gray series.  Too bad.<br />The audio cassette performance is in the tradition of old time radio with multiple voices and sound effects.  It's a bit confusing to keep track of who's who but not too confusing.  I recommend trying to listen in one sitting, if you can.	2001-01-02

This is one of several stitch directories in my library.  It isn't my favorite but I still use it regularly.  <br />What I like about this book is the photography of the samples.  Other books may (and often do) explain the actual working of the pattern better (Barbara Walker's Treasuries come to mind) but you have to be attracted to a pattern/stitch to even want to try it.  This is a very good resource when looking for a stitch that strikes your fancy.<br />Of the various volume in this series, this is certainly the most useful for everyday knitting.  The other books have some neat fancy stuff but when it comes to relatively basic stitches, this is a handy book to have on the shelf.	2001-01-01

It's set in the early days of the realm of King John - the king who was so bad that the barons forced the Magna Carta on him.<br />As for the romance, virtually every romance novel involves overcoming obstacles to finding true love.  Usually the pair are from warring countries or he's killed a family member or something serious is in the way.  In this book, there is no good reason for our heroine not to be willing, if not thrilled, to be betrothed to Falcon.  He's young, handsome and even on the same side.  Why he puts up with her running off to court and total self-centeredness is hard to understand.<br />Still, the pace is enough that I never doubted that I'd finish the book.  It's the first of a trilogy (with The Marriage Prize and The Dragon and the Jewel).  I doubt I'll go out of my way to read the other two volumes.	2000-12-31

She's a jewelery designer living in a co-op apartment and he's a successful real estate developer living on a houseboat. The menace factor escalates as do the steamy sex scenes.<br />So why only one star?? -- 1. There's no romantic chemistry between Paris and Tobias.  2. The rest of the characters in the book are pretty unpleasant.  3. There's some really gratuitous rough sex between some of the supporting characters - not fun to read at all (for me).  4. Because I came really close to abandoning this book midway through because I simply didn't care for the good guys and didn't want to waste my time reading about the bad guys.<br />Still, in fairness, somebody out there likes this book.  It's on the Romantic Times Top 200 books of the 80's and 90's and was a Reviewer's Choice nominee.  Just wouldn't be on my list.	2000-12-29

This book provoked the most heated, on-task discussion my book group ever experienced.  And what was so contraversial?<br />Some of our younger members (30 somethings) had a hard time with the idea of over age 50 romance.  Our 50 somethings thought that it was about time the world acknowledged that post-menopausal women still enjoy sex.  <br />Some of the group found the sex scenes too racey and others thought they were really boring -- the sex itself, not the writing thereof.<br />Our more politically correct members struggled with the idea of a woman being &quot;kept&quot; by a man in pursuit of her art.  Others thought that it was about time that women artists had their own muses to provide support for them.<br />Probably the most contraversy revolved around the artwork itself - a series of male nudes painted in settings of the great paintings of Jesus.  Our group covers a wide span of religious beliefs and there were some really passionate opinions on whether or not this was blasphemy.<br />I personally really enjoyed this book and enjoyed the discussion it provoked.  I'd recommend it to individual readers and book groups who are tired of everyone agreeing on books.	2000-12-29

It features American knitters from all over the country -- very fun to see pictures of some of the designers and learn about them.  There are also about 40 designs, some classic and some that are pretty out there.  The photography is divine.<br />Unfortunately, this book hasn't stood the test of time well for me.  I tend to prefer knitting books that I refer to over and over again.  This book lacks the quality of being a good reference for either technique or designing.  I doubt that I look at more than once every six months.<br />Bottom line -- if you can find a copy for a good price, a nice second tier addition to a knitting library.  But if the budget is tight, there are many equally beautiful and much more useful books on the market.	2000-12-29

I'm knitting a second design and pondering several more.  Still, even if you don't like the looks of the designs, this book is worth buying if you have a box or a closet or a room full of leftover yarn or yarn that just hasn't quite become a sweater.  (Who us knitters, buy yarn just because? :))<br />There are two huge reasons to have this book if you have yarn.  First, Sally provides a very thoughtful chapter on how to organize your stash in a manner that will both stimulate your creativity while protecting your valuable stash.  Secondly, she provides terrific instruction on using the color wheel to combine colors in a manner that doesn't just look like you threw a bunch of leftovers together.  The designs are a bit boxy -- in part, I suspect, because of the complexity of the color work in most of the sweaters.<br />This is not a book for beginners, but a fabulous resource of intermediate and advanced &quot;fiberholics&quot;.	2000-12-26

While not dark at a noir level, this is a heavy tale.  It's interesting but not beach reading.  (If you like your psychiatrists with a sense of humor, try the wonderful Stephen Walsh White series featuring Alan Gregory in Boulder, Colorado.)<br />The Independent Mystery Booksellers Association voted this one of the 100 best mysteries of the 20th Century.

Maybe it was the less than sympathic victim.  It's hard to make a 30 year mother unlikeable and deserving of death but Kate Sumner may be that character.  The use of only two suspects was at times intriguing but left me feeling a little like a tennis ball after a long volley. I'll admit that I cheated and read the ending ahead of time.  That may have actually improved this read since I was concentrating on how they'd unmask the killer, not who was the killer.  The police procedural part was fairly interesting.	2000-12-21

Death of a Dissident, while acknowledging the Communist state, is much more a book of real people living and working in this world.  Just because they're communists doesn't mean they don't commit crimes of passion or worry about their children or whether they can win an athletic competition.<br />This is the debut of the long running series feature Rostnikov and his two assistants.  I'll certainly be reading more.  It's fundamentally a police procedural -- but with both a Russian mind and the Russian system to work within.<br />In this book a dissident is murdered the day before a show trial where he had hoped to get his message to the western media.  It quickly becomes clear that this isn't a KGB murder but that a mad man is out there.  Kaminsky guides the reader through a fascinating mix of genuine clues and red herrings.  A good read.<br />I haven't read later books in this series but so much happens in this book to establish the chemistry of the trio of detectives.  It's worth chasing down a copy to start at the beginning.	2000-12-19

On one such venture, she encounters pirate Devon.  They kiss and then it's back to her boring life.  Then, on a trip to London to please her aunt, Merry is kidnapped in the course of a burglary and ends up on Devon's ship.  It quickly is clear that Devon is no ordinary pirate - and he demands that Merry turn over the name of her brother.  She refuses.  This leads to several hundred pages of fun romantic tension as the two learn to trust each other and love each other. In the meanwhile, the reader becomes good friends with a charming pirate crew.<br />Lots of romantic tension, an interesting setting (War of 1812 politics) and some great characters make this a really fun read.  It misses a fifth star because it's a bit to drawn out.	2000-12-19

Indeed, it's a testament to Dame Agatha that she devised such a complex plot at such an early stage in her writing career.<br />The plot is classic British small town mystery.  An unpopular man is dead and there are a host of people with motives - but none with an obvious opportunity.  Miss Marple chases some red herrings but eventually sees that which isn't quite right.<br />I listened to the abridged BBC version with mixed feelings.  Three hours is probably a reasonable amount of time for this plot so I don't regret the abridgement.  However, this is a presented as a radio drama (not a reading of the text) and it's a bit confusing to follow all of the characters.  I'd recommend that other readers listen to this in one sitting, preferably with few distractions.	2000-12-18

Barr once again transports the reader to a national park with the eyes of a ranger.  This time we visit Isle Royale, in the middle of Lake Superior, a rocky place where transportation is by sea.  (A deadly sea -- remember Gordon Lightfoot's The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald???).  It's worth looking up the park web site for a map.<br />The humans in the book are plenty interesting also.  Anna Pidgeon is a bit more multi-dimensional than in Track of the Cat.  She has her flaws and a wicked little sense of humor is more evident.  The characters on the island are solid and make for plenty of red herrings. <br />The flaws in this story are minor.  It takes a long time for the set-up and I began to wonder if we'd ever have a mystery.  The ultimate solution is very original but how Anna makes the connections also left me shaking my head.<br />Bottom line -- a solid mystery plot with an interesting education about Isle Royale and its unique environment.	2000-12-18

But rarely has it been handled better than is in this fascinating mystery, The Face of a Stranger.  Imagine waking up not knowing who you are.  Imagine having to pretend you haven't lost your memory because acknowledging it would mean the end of your job and probable poverty.  Perry explores this fascinating territory in the character of William Monk, working class Victorian detective.<br />The characters are probably the strongest part of this novel.  Monk is most interesting as snatches of his past are revealed to him -- not all of which are pleasant.  Hester Latterly is introduced as the veteran of Crimean War nursing (think Florence Nightengale).  Even the circle of friends and acquaintences of the victim span a variety of circumstances.  The Crimean War also plays a significant role as England struggles to come to terms with its lost sons and prestige.<br />The unraveling of the mystery works quite well with an appropriate number of informative red herrings.<br />All things considered, a dandy read.  The book is a bit on the dark and bleak side, but nothing so depressing that you wouldn't want it for a vacation read.  I look forward to learning more about Monk in the next book in the series, A Dangerous Mourning.	2000-12-16

In this second book in the series, Thomas Black is hired to locate a missing man, Lance. Lance failed to meet his black girlfriend at the marriage license bureau. It turns out that Lance is the sole heir to a 15 million dollar fortune who has lived as a street person for the last few years. Hence, Thomas follows a trail through both the homeless life of Seattle and the black sub-culture as he seeks Lance.<br />This was a pretty good read. The clues, while sometimes pretty improbable, turn up regularly. Still, there's no glamour in this tale or humor.	2000-12-15

This is the first romance I've seen set in the Phillippines during the Civil War against the Spanish in 1896.  So far, so good.<br />Unfortunately, Jill Barnett (whose work I usually enjoy) mucks this up with two protagonists who I found pretty annoying.  Lollie is such a ditz that her screw-ups go from funny to simply stupid.  Sam is violent and mean.  I had a hard time finding the chemistry between them.<br />Still, this book was selected by Romantic Times as one of the 200 best romances since 1981 so other readers must enjoy it (just not me).	2000-12-15

I'm a little surprised it won an Edgar but it was almost 20 years ago.  Standards may have changed.  <br />What stands out about this mystery is the nautical/Cape Cod element.  Boats and ships and ship building are the core of this novel.  I found this interesting.  The plot is a little far fetched, but I'm not a bored guy trying to get through a mid-life crisis by poking my nose into a murder. My middle aged husband has gotten quite a kick out of this book - so maybe it's a guy thing.<br />Bottom line: a good read - easy to imagine the reader on the beach with this story.  I'll check out at least one other Boyer book.	2000-12-13

Jaded American with Irish roots goes to Ireland and finds love with charming Irish woman.  I'm not sure if this a complaint.  Sometimes all I want out of a romance novel is a new spin on a favorite plot line, which is the case with this novel.<br />That concern aside, this is a solidly written and entertaining title.  Romantic Times has awarded it a Reviewer's Choice award and named it one of the top 200 novels in the last 20 years.<br />I particularly liked the pacing of the romance which unfolded gradually through the book with plenty of hints.	2000-12-11

It was an interesting introduction to Mallory - child of the streets and genius computer hacker.  Having read the other reviews I suspect that the tape glosses over some of the complexity that seems to cause controversy.  <br />Probably the most interesting elements of this story revolve around the illusions and the insider trading but enough said - don't want to give too much away.<br />I'm not yet in love with O'Connell but will certainly gave the sequel a read.  In the for what it's worth department, the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association selected this book as one of the top 100 mysteries in the 20th Century.	2000-12-11

Yet this book (and series I assume - as this is the first in a series) is different from Diane Mott Davidson's Goldy the Caterer series.  The heroine sleuth is Shirley McClintock - fifty something, retired from a high level job in Washington DC (only vaguely described), twice widowed and now living on her family ranch.  She's not afraid to take a stand against the pro-lifers outside of an abortion clinic or to fight for an orphaned child.  She's spunky but in a refreshing way.<br />The murder mystery part of this book is solidly constructed.  The probable culprits emerge fairly early but the reasons for their actions are only revealed at the end.  It all has to do with an evangelical church, a real estate depression and women's rights.  Not safe territory but very interesting for me.<br />I'll be reading more in this series.	2000-12-09

Rita Morrone, Philadelphia lawyer, is a sassy lady with a penchant for play life like a poker game.  Indeed, her best friends are her father's poker cronies and they are probably the most memorable thing about this book.<br />Despite Barbara Rosenblat's splendid narration (as always), this book doesn't click.  The pacing is inconsistent, particularly at the end which has about three extra chapters. Rita's legal life and ethics go beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief. She's a partner at her age???  She has no clue as to legal ethics??? Get real.  And it's too bad, because I like the poker buddies and would love to encounter them again.	2000-12-09

Seriously, this is a small town romance where the greatest obstacle to Sophie and Zeke's happiness is their own pride.  It's cute for awhile but there were times I just wanted to knock their heads together and tell them to wake up.<br />Fans of Pamela Morsi will probably enjoy this book.  It's pretty well written -- enough to win a Reviewer's Choice Award from Romantic Times.  Besides, it may well be the only book ever set in Rocky Ford, Colorado -- a small town on the eastern prairie that grows the most wonderful melons.	2000-12-08

In this sense, this is typical, if not classic, PI fiction.  <br />So why read this book?  I read it because a critic named Gardner named it one of the best dectective books of the 20th Century.  I'm not sure if I'd go that far but it's a solid read.  There are plenty of red herrings and a curve ball ending.  It's also a bit of a time capsule.  Readers with ties to the East Bay will enjoy the jaunts into cities rarely seen in fiction (Castro Valley and Concord).	2000-12-07

It had books and it had Colorado (always fun to read a book and know where everything is....).  I really missed the Colorado element in this effort which is set in the Puget Sound area.<br />Also, while the bookman's insight remains fascinating, the plot of this book is bit too far-fetched to ring true, particularly the ending.<br />Still, above average writing gives this four stars.	2000-12-06

Mallory's mentor and hero is found dead in the bathtub and there are rumors flying of a newly discovered Hammett.  Add in a variety of writing types, two widows of the dead man, a slimy publisher and a cute magazine editor.  It's a fun, light read - not cozy cute nor noir dark.

Selected by Romantic Times as one of the top 200 romances written since 1980.<br />Basically, this is a book with a split personality.  The first 300 or so pages are the saga of a poverty stricken Irish girl going through one crisis after another.  Our &quot;hero&quot;, Bryce, appears three times - all briefly.  The final third of the book is their &quot;romance&quot;.<br />This book disappointed me.  It may be just my taste, but when I set out to read a romance, I expect the male and female to be interacting with each other.  Also, the characters aren't very interesting or deep.  Callie is so busy surviving that there isn't much else to her.  Bryce is a one dimensional guy that we never learn much about.  Indeed, the only character with any charm for me was the butler, Edward - a chess playing, closet romantic black gentleman.<br />If you like rags to riches sagas, there are better efforts out there (think Barbara Taylor Bradford) and if you want romance....	2000-12-03

Not that I have anything against courtroom dramas, but I always wondered what the fuss was about.  Now I can only say that I really wish I had read this book as a teenager, even though it was still a wonderful read for this 40-something year old.<br />It is an eloquent testimony to growing up in the South during the depression.  However, unlike so many &quot;Southern&quot; novels, this isn't a depressing book.  Tough, difficult things happen but the reader comes away inspired.  It reminded me a little bit of Angela's Ashes.  Perhaps this feeling derives from the narrator being a child but it works.<br />I won't bore you with the plot.  Simply said, this is a classic for good reason.  It has lots to say and it says with style and grace.  It also has enough plot to be chosen by the International Mystery Booksellers Association as one of the 100 best mysteries of the 20th century.	2000-12-01

She ends up agreeing to be the mistress of lumber and shipping tycoon Jason Drake in exchange for his &quot;protection.&quot;  The saga that follows covers about five years as Mary and Jason find a life on his island in the San Juans.  <br />I read this book because Romantic Times named it one of the 200 best in their 200th anniversary issue.  I'm not sure that it would be a keeper for me.  Still, it's a good story with enough complexity that I read it more slowly than many historical romances.

I re-read Private Practices in one sitting last night. It only reconfirmed why I grab White's books as soon as they're printed.<br />First and fundamentally, White writes with great suspense and lots of unexpected twists and turns. In this book, a ski death, a spousal abuse murder,the crash of the United flight in Sioux City, a gas explosion and a gourmet restaurant all find their way into the tangled web.<br />Still,when I recommend White to friends (which I do often), the recommendation always includes the wonderful dry humor of the books.About 3/4's of the humor is universal and a healthy forth is directed at Colorado things - weather, the People's Republic of Boulder and skiers. Funny enough for outsiders and really big grins for locals.<br />One word of caution to new readers of the Alan Gregory series. Unlike many male slueths, Alan doesn't have a new babe in each book. If you want to follow his romantic relationship, as well as the progress of friends and neighbors, this is a series worth reading in sequence. It starts with Priviledged Information. This book, Private Practices, is the second in the series...	2000-11-29

That's just the first 100 pages of this book.  This book looks at the first four years of Miranda and Jared's marriage and they go go through some wild &quot;adventures&quot; in the path to true love.<br />It says something that this book is still in print after almost 20 years.  It also was chosen as one of Romantic Times Top 200 Books of the 20th Century.  The pacing is fast, the locations exotic and Miranda is a fun, spunky heroine.  While the setting is largely the Regency period, this is no conventional Regency romance.<br />Unconquered is a fantasy, but it's a fun romp.  Some of the undertones are a bit dated but surely were just the thing in 1981.  I gobbled it down in a single sitting.  Enjoy	2000-11-25

Kate Martinelli fan shouldn't be quite so surprised for the concept of cults has been featured in the Martinelli series.  For this is not a murder mystery, who-dun-it, in any kind of a conventional form.  The story is of the pre-emptive investigation of a cult.  There is a suspense component --what in the heck is going on here.  Still, the meat of the book focuses on the transformation of Ann Waverley/Anna Wakefield under the heat of undercover investigation.<br />The writing is, at times, brilliant and at other times, too wordy and redundant.  The overall tone is dull and bleak.  The ending left me breathing a sigh of relief (that it was over) on one hand and also really wondering what happened to the characters.	2000-11-25

They weren't awful but they just didn't resonate with me.  So, I pulled Body of Evidence, the second in the Kay Scarpetta series, off the shelf.  I was reminded why I became a Cornwell fan.  The plot is interesting with some great twists and turns.  The characters are growing more complex.  Mostly it's a tidy book with a clear beginning and ending.  So many of the most recent Scarpetta's seems to leave things unresolved.  <br />This isn't an awesome book but a good solid read, particularly for readers who are new to the genre and would be more comforable with a known author.	2000-11-24

Tess Monaghan is a native of the city and gives many wonderful insights as she unravels the mystery of who killed a prominent attorney.<br />Four stars for characters -- Tess is a delight.  She has much of the humor of Davidson's Goldy, Evanovich's Stephanie Plum or Grafton's Kinsey Milhone.  I look forward to getting to know her better in further episodes.  The supporting cast is very interesting also, particularly Tess' aunt Kitty who runs a feminist cum childrens bookstore.<br />Three stars for plot-- this one takes a while to get rolling.

Most are multi-color intarsia efforts (Sharp's signature) for advanced knitters.  There are several single color efforts suitable for advanced beginners and up.<br />My reservations about buying this book are threefold.  First, I tend to shy away from expensive books that are just patterns.  Unlike Meg Swansen's Knitting, this book doesn't have much in the way of technique tips or other timeless hints that I can use in my general knitting.  Secondly, published in 1997, the designs are already looking a little dated.  Third, there are better books out there for inspiration on colorwork.  Kaffe Fassett's books are much more likely to provoke artistry.  Sally Melville's Styles is a much more helpful guide for color combining and stash reduction.<br />So, a book to enjoy and buy if the designs really catch your fancy.	2000-11-22

Not your typical premise for historical romance.  I wasn't quite prepared for this.  However, in a genre with many &quot;done to death&quot; settings, this is interesting stuff, assuming you are expecting it.<br />The romance takes a backset to the politics of this book.  It didn't capture my attention.<br />The book also has a moderate dose of Christian fundamentalist undertones which may be hard for some readers (like me) to handle.  <br />All the same, I can see why this book won a Reviewer's Choice award.  It's a little bit like the Oscars.  This is an original and different book.  It may not be something you'll like but it deserves recognition for it's courage in trying to write of new and unusual themes.	2000-11-20

This is a great book for the library of any intermediate or advanced knitter.  Meg has designed clever and stunning sweaters.  The Turkish pair are all but mesmorizing.  Still, I may never knit any of the sweaters.  They're beautiful but I've seen them in person and they are generally too heavy for my climate.  All the same, they're photographed beautifully and are simply wonderful to drool over even if you live in warmer parts of the world.<br />Still, the quality that makes this book a keeper is the wonderful tricks and techniques section in the front of the book.  Tired of bloops of underlying color when attaching i-cord; Meg offers a simple and totally effective solution. There are dozens of these tips which can transform your knitting from amateur to finished.	2000-11-19

I read this book in one sitting, which speaks well for the pacing and the writer's voice.  There's not much original about this marriage of convinience tale but Claybourne tells it with plenty of wit and humor.  Melisande is a fun and endearing heroine.  William is missing some important details - why did he run away to America and such.  <br />I'll hold on to my copy of this book for now and be happy to lend it to a friend, but I won't fret if it doesn't come back.	2000-11-19

It's a first book and it was written in 1929 (before the crash).  Yes, the language is of a different place and time.  Some of it is awkward for a modern ear (the &quot;foreigner&quot; phrase in particular).  Still, I enjoy being transported to a different world once in awhile and reading writing from that time is different than when a modern writer writes of history.<br />The plotting on this is pretty simple - finite number of suspects and such.  The ending came a little bit too much from left field for my taste.  <br />Bottom line - an adequate first effort.  Don't judge Tey on the basis of this book -- later books are much better.	2000-11-18

I was disappointed with &quot;Killer Pancake&quot; which just didn't click for me.  In &quot;The Main Corpse&quot;, Diane and Goldy are back in real Colorado and doing much better.<br />The key pieces of this puzzle include a very rainy June (we had more than one in the 1990's), a gold mine, a shady stock offering (Colorado was infamous for them in the 1980's), and lots of running around in the mountains.  <br />The plots in this series are typically not the main reason to read the books.  What I really enjoy is Goldy's &quot;voice&quot; as she tells her stories and the way she portrays the up and down sides of life here in Colorado.  Both aspects are in fine shape in this mystery.<br />One caution to those who may be thinking of picking up this book for a first read of this series.  This series, more than most, is a continuing affair as Goldy and her family and friends mature.  It's well worth it to start with her first book, Catering to Nobody, and working your way through the series.	2000-11-17

In late 1800's Montana, lady doctor Olivia is abducted by outcast Gabe to save his twin daughters from diptheria.  Of course, when it's time to go home, a convenient landslide traps them for the winter.  <br />This is a very solid romance read.  A pragmatist might find it a bit contrived.  Still, it brings to life a fantasy that many women share.  So enjoy it if you can find a copy.	2000-11-17

I've used my copy so much that the spine broke.  Ended up getting it spiral bound at the copy shop which has worked great.<br />Bottom line -- thank the knitting goddess that this is back in print and get a copy if you don't have one!	2000-11-17

And while the setting is integral to the plot, there is not much atmosphere in this book.  Basically, this is a dated (written in 1973)piece.  It is, if such a thing is possible, a Cold War cozy murder mystery.  I like cozies and I like a good Cold War thriller (LeCarre, etc.) but for me this combination just didn't work.  It lacks the cute and clever of an endearing cozy.  Nor doesn't have the page turning suspense of a good Cold War thriller.<br />Also, don't be fooled by the title -- the cat has almost nothing to do with the book.  Cat mystery fans will have much more fun with the Lilian Jackson Braun/Rita Mae Brown/Carole Nelson Douglas series.	2000-11-16

Well, this book is seventy years old and goes to prove that wacky families are nothing new in literature.  It includes the last of the Oakes clan - early Yankee settlers who are now running away to the circus, crazy or simple.  They can't farm their own land so enter the Polish immigrants.  What follows is a clash of cultures, bigotry and a little romance.<br />While the plot could be part of contemporary fiction, it is the tone and style that sets this book apart.  Some of the writing would not pass any political correctness test.  Still, in other ways there is a gentle and calm quality that makes this book quite readable.<br />The good/bad part of the book is that my book group all agreed on it.  We found it a pleasant window into a world that was fairly interesting.  Still, it didn't incite much passion in any of us, let alone providing any juicy meat for disagreement.	2000-11-14

What a treasure.  The book isn't for novice knitters but if you're a solid beginner there are good choices and if you're an expert there are some ideas that will keep you knitting all night.  It includes baby socks and tough big guy hiker socks.<br />Technically the charts and instructions are very easy to follow.  I particularly like the fact that there are several toe-up socks in addition to the the usual leg-down socks.  They also made the book relatively timeless by just designating yarn weights and yardages - not specific brand names that will probably not be on the market in the future.<br />I also like that the socks are the result of a contest and while there are some &quot;designer&quot; socks, most are the creations of talented hobby knitters.  Congrats to XRX.<br />My only wishes for the next edition --  1. a discussion on washing and care of socks (since they get dirty when worn). 2. instructions, if they could get permission from Joyce Williams, of her brilliant 2 circular needle method of knitting (a wonderful improvement over double-pointed sock knitting).	2000-11-14

This book really opened the eyes of both my husband and I about the world of 1950's Watts and the whole red-baiting McCarthyism scene.  Pretty scary stuff but a good thing for two white boomers.<br />EZ Rawlins continues to grown as a character.  Clay's narration on the unaudited tape is terrific.  The side characters are pretty interesting.  The plot is solid and has a dandy twist at the end.  Still, what lingers with me is the scenes of black life - the churches, the bars, EZ's wisdom on concealing his wealth.<br />A good read if you like mysteries and/or are interested in a look at African-American culture from a point of view other than the Oprah books.	2000-11-14

Boy knows girl, girl knows boy but both are clueless that they are meant for each other.  What is different about this book is that it takes on ageism as Miss Hattie is several years older than Reed.  It's also set around the turn of the century, a time that hasn't been done to death in romantic fiction.<br />The book's a little slow to get started but the last hundred pages are hard to put down.  Not a keeper but a good read.	2000-11-14

Alamo Square with Victorian Row houses with downtown in the background.  Muller's third Sharon McCone novel has a terrific sense of place and taught me many new things about the Victorian scene in San Francisco.<br />Still, the pacing seems a bit bogged down. The side characters, often a highlight in Muller's books, aren't very interesting or sympathetic.  Who cares if one of them is killed -- just don't wreck the Tiffany Lamp.<br />A good read if you love the atmosphere of &quot;romantic San Francisco&quot; but otherwise so-so.	2000-11-13

Perhaps not the best way to learn your purls and knits, but wonderful if you're tired of being a blind follower of patterns.  EZ can teach you how to be a thinking knitter - and one with a sense of humor.  Scared of steeking a sweater (i.e. cutting it with sissors)?  EZ will guide you through the process in detail and finish with the advice to drink a glass of wine, lie on the bed and recover.<br />I'm a serious knitter and while I've mastered the technics of the book long ago, I still pick it up for EZ's wonderful, chatty style.  The typos drive some people crazy but make the book all the more real for me.	2000-11-13

I commend the author for the courage to write about drug treatment for adolescents.  Not the kind of thing most publishers love but I learned a little bit.<br />That being said, this is a good romance. The protaganists, Summer and Brody, are complex enough for the romantic tensions to be genuine.  The book falters when the author trys to overlay a sinister component which seemed rather contrived and unnecessary.	2000-11-13

Actually, Harry probably would prefer a dog but the independent, ornery nature of a cat seems more true.<br />Harry's on suspension and finds himself digging into the unsolved murder of his prostitute mother.  By the time he's done we've learned plenty about Los Angeles in the early 60's, politics and the angst of a policeman without a badge.  My husband, a former cop, simply shakes his head at Connelly's ability to express the experience of a renegade cop.<br />We listen to these as books on tape and 13 hours go by in flash.  Connelly's books are terrifically paced and this one has one heck of an ending.	2000-11-13

Was Richard III the evil murderer of the princes -- or not?<br />I think this book one of the most fascinating mixes of history and mystery (two of my favorite areas) and reread it regularly.  So when my book club asked me to recommend a mystery, this was an easy choice (backed up by it's ranking as one of Amazon's best mysteries of the Century).  Well, they hated it. Why bother solving a centuries old mystery?  So I offer this experience to say that this is a terrific book if you like mysteries or English history.  Others may not care for it.	2000-11-13

His inquiring mind leads to poachers, land grabs, militias and family secrets.<br />McGarrity provides Kerney with some solid, if a bit two-dimensional, supporting characters -- sexy assistant district attorney, want-to-be a cop assistant and lots of crusty ranch types.  Still it is the imagery of the Gila mountains and the desert surrounded highways that is lingering days after I finished this book.  <br />Bottom-line: Excellent sense of place, good plot and players.	2000-11-13

As a first book goes, it's solid but not stunning.  Carlotta and her supporting cast (crazy artist roomie, cab drivers, &quot;little sister&quot;) are all interesting enough.  The plot seems a bit contrived.  The blues music interest doesn't quite ring true.  It's as if the author was told to give your character and interesting hobby.<br />Bottom line -- Don't go out of your way to read this book but at the same time, don't let it put you off from later books in the series, some of which are great reads.	2000-11-13

This book isn't about trends or things you could never wear or afford. <br />What this book is, is simply a great reference for most common needs of the beginning and intermediate knitter. There are bigger stitch dictionaries. There are books with way more patterns. What this book delivers is enough information on most topics to help you on a regular basis. I've owned this book well over a dozen years and still use its wonderful cast off and grafting diagrams routinely. <br />I found this easier to work with than Montese Stanley's or June Hemons Hiatt's books -- and in the case of Hiatt, much more affordable.	2000-11-13
