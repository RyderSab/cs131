The story is quite good but, now and again, seems to get into a different mode. I mean one minute he seems to be talking to us of events yesterday or last week, then the next as if it was years ago.<br /><br />The reader, though, is the perfect compliment to the ideas conveyed by the author. It was easy for me to imagine the subjects face simply by hearing the narrator's voice speaking the writer's words. I was able to easily imagine an old shipmate (M. Hill of Missouri) telling some of us his life story.<br /><br />Had the last chapter been omitted I would have given this five stars. Even so, I and all my friends at westwardho.us would have been proud to have written a book only half so well as Larry wrote this'n - Bill Anderson.	2005-09-05

Bush at War	This work by Woodward gives a terrific insight into the minds of Bush and those around him at a period of great emotional stress.<br /><br />After 9/11 there was bound to be a vengeful attitude. The rout in Afghanistan planted the seeds of the Bush Administration Folly In Iraq. Sorry, but one must call it as one sees it.<br /><br />As I listened to this audio I was struck by the realization that the Bush Administration does a great job of following the script. When circumstances deviate significantly, however, the Bush Administration mirrors Bush - there is no ability to improvise or to funadmentally adjust to the new reality.<br /><br />First case in point is Iraq after Saddam Hussein was ousted. The military succeeded in their task beyond expectations. It was only afterwards that America got caught in the quagmire that is obviously a civil war between the Sunnis and Shias (fought for the Shias by American and British troops).<br /><br />Second case in point is Louisiana and Mississippi the five days after Hurricane Katrina. The Bush Administration was unable to do anything quickly because they had no script!<br /><br />Two points more - Colin Powell should have resigned when it became clear to him that Bush had decided to go to war. To figure out why I say so, I encourage you to buy the book.<br /><br />The second point is that Woodward probably should not be writing news for the Post plus writing books of this sort. The sacrifice that he has to make to gain access and insight has to be paid by his inability to report his insights when he has them in the daily newspaper for fear such comments will reduce his access. He may not recognize the cost, but it is apparent to many of us readers.	2005-09-05

Any deliberative, thoughtful, introspective reader will devour this treatise.<br /><br />Religious persuasion may lead you to consider Joseph's obervations. Certainly I, in reading his statements, was enthralled with his candor and frankness.<br /><br />Religious persuasion, however, should not prevent you gathering the insight of this remarkable historian.<br /><br />Don't confuse this book for a specific insight into today's Middle East turbulence. It frankly has no direct bearing on current events in any concrete sense.<br /><br />Having said that, though, I must interject that in an oblique, or abstract, way, the Wars of the Jews is of immense value in comparison of mass psychology and in leadership evaluation. In other words, The Rome of the first century is not altogether different than the America of the 21st century.<br /><br />That, however, is only one aspect in which this book is a must read. A second reason is to gain insight into a region that was undergoing massive change 2,000 years ago. In reading this book, or in listening to the audio version, the area called Palestine, Syria, Israel or the Middle East actually comes alive.<br /><br />You can gain a real understanding of the times. Mind you, the facts and figures (data) of the times is available in many other ways. None, though, provides so strong a sense of the times as does this text.<br /><br />If those two reasons are insufficient, then, by all means, consider the worth of this magnificent rendition for its tidbits into Jesus and John The Baptist, or his explanation of the three basic groups of Jews - Pharisees, Sadduccees and Essenes. You will find in this discussion, if you take time to contemplate, much to absorb your mind in realizing for just how long has humanity been debating such conflicting philosophies as we now do.<br /><br />Trust me, this is one book that each serious truth-seeker will want to keep in their library. Ditto the audiobook version.

Lest you think I am some wimp for watching a daytime soap I will introduce myself. I hate soaps. Sorry, I find 98% of them to be tripe examples of self pity - yes, that sounds like Julian Crane, but what can I say?<br /><br />Passions, though, I have found to be one of those kinds of series that is simply fascinating. I LOVE THE THING!<br /><br />I suppose it was the snide humor that gripped me. And Timmy and his heart-wrenching death. You shall always live in our hearts, Josh Ryan Evans, for you reminded us all of the power of goodness, nearly as well as Pope John Paul II.<br /><br />Anyway, the book Hidden Passions is a terrific read and gives one a great insight into the characters of the best series to come to TV since The Simpsons.	2005-04-05

Certainly, this is a fun, inspiring book written by a person who knows what he's writing about.<br /><br />There are well-written chapters for each of the top sellers - parakeets, cockatiels, finches and love birds. I found each of the bird breeding-specific chapters to be helpful, although further details should be included in a future edition.<br /><br />I am hopeful the author, or another capable writer with experience, will soon issue a similar book for the more lucrative Parrots, Macaws, and so forth.<br /><br />Even 10 years after writing my original review of The Complete Guide to Raising Pet Birds for Profit, this book remains one of my three favorite in this category. My other two favorites are The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Caged and Aviary Birds and The Complete Pet Bird Owner's Handbook.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the prospects for profitable bird keeping will definitely live The Complete Guide to Raising Pet Birds for Profit.<br /><br />There are several other sources, print and digital format for more detailed information on raising aviary birds.

If you will peruse my other two reviews of guides published by Food Service Professional you will note I am not bashful - when they short change me I tell you straight out!<br />This guide, though, is superior to any other guide I have read - thorough, detailed, and helpful without wasting reams of paper to appear more complete. This is a must-read for anybody wanting to set their menu prices at optimum profitability.<br />I especially appreciated the various formulas, explanations and examples they provided so I could get my head around the topic (as the Brits are fond of saying) and not feel that some rule of thumb (such as, three times the ingredient cost) is the only way to price. Rules of thumb can get you in trouble and are only a guide based on 'all other things being equal.' That explains why I liked their information throughout chapter 5. This one chapter would probably be worth a full semester in college!<br />To be sure, the principles elucidated in chapter five can be applied to any business economics class and such students would gain immeasurable benefit.<br />Be watching for LJ's Breaking Free$ to learn more ways to make money by starting your own business or small farm - Bill Anderson (LJ).	2004-01-12

Further, the update through the 20th Century should shed light on some of the origins of the current conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.<br />I submit that the conflict is rooted in the greed of rich businessmen and landowners from both groups - exploiting religious prejudice for personal profit and power.<br /><br />It is not so much that Ariel Sharon or Yasser Arafat are bad men as that they have become ensnared by the traps set a hundred years ago by those who were afraid to lose influence and financial standing. Nearly every single Israeli and Arab I have spoken to has a desire for peace and freedom - they want to put a roof over their children's heads, give them balanced meals, and send them to university so they, the children, can go on to also provide a better life for their own children and grandchildren.	2004-01-12

This is an excellent book if one wants to know how fur farming was done in the 1920s and 1930s and could even have been great into the 40s and 50s. Now, though, that modernization has crept in I can only rate this book as good and interesting reading for the person wanting to get some useful information.<br />I am confident this book would find a niche market for those of us wanting to start a fur farm if the publisher would update it and include some color photographs of fur farms as they now ply their trade.<br />Getting help from fur farmers, though, may be difficult due to the tactics recently used by fanatics that don't believe other people have a right to pursue happiness while doing something they enjoy. I'll not do such groups the dignity of naming them for that would simply do nothing to promote tolerance and love.<br />Back to my review:<br />Fur farming and raising other similar critters can help one extricate him or herself from the drudgery of wage-slaving - most of us would love to break free from the tangled web our society has woven but we are unable to find a small industry that appeals to us.

It has become fashionable for politicians to ridicule government spending and waste. Certainly there are occasions when employees have squandered funds on research, but in the early days of our republic such was not the case.<br />This book, combined with the two-part HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIANS (Bulletin 30 issued by The Bureau of American Ethnology) are great compilations that could only have been funded by the federal government. In dollars and cents no private concern could expect a fair return on their investment that would have been necessary to get the results that was accomplished.<br />You will have to search long to find the books. Amazon might be of much help. I, however, found my copies at Powell's Books in Portland, Oregon.<br />Contrary to many depictions by Hollywood, many American pioneers fought to defend the rights of Native Americans.

This is a terrific book for any aspiring publisher considering trying to improve their community by starting a weekly newspaper.<br /><br />As a former magazine publisher and journalist for a small community weekly newspaper I can speak with some authority regarding this book - buy it, read it, ponder it, then read it again and again.<br /><br />Jock Lauterer writes from experience and does a great job on getting you to understand the world of local news reporting . Bear in mind, daily newspapers provide a great service themselves, but, community newspapers are the key to community growth.<br /><br />At the community level, though, it is you who will be setting the agenda that will evolve into next year's headlines!<br />Actually, every once in awhile you will be the first to report on something that later does become of national interest - in 1980 the little paper in Powell, Wyoming reported of the discovery of a long-thought extinct Black-footed ferret near Cody, Wyoming. In 1990 I wrote a small blurb regarding Iraq's invasion of Kuwait that became the defining and deciding issue of a congressional campaign in Oregon.<br /><br />You will especially appreciate the lessons learned described in Chapter 20 - Two case studies of community newspaper start-ups. Lauterer gives a good narrative on two occasions in which he started community newspapers - one a stunning success, the other less successful but not at all a failure. His honest appraisal of the latter serves as a good reminder to anyone thinking about trying to invest their life savings and their soul in their ideals.<br /><br />Community Journalism is a great book for anybody contemplating a career in journalism. This book belongs in every community library, as well as on every small town journalist's bookshelf.	2003-12-30

I have found this to be one of the best western books ever written.

Although they don't intend to print fiction, they are thinking about making an exception for this terrific title. Why?<br /><br />The folks at westwardho say, \\"Log of a cowboy is so near to truth that it is hard to call it fiction. It certainly is more true to life than some of the news articles written in the recent past!\\"<br /><br />I appreciate much of the modern miracles we take for granted - internet, mobile (cellular) phones, satellite TV and the ability to produce tremendous, special-effects driven movies. Still, I wonder if we are missing something in all our instant self-gratification lifestyle...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I am not one to call the old days the good days. We not only have more luxury today, we also have more opportunity and greater political and intellectual freedom. I am merely trying to point out that many of us fail to seize opportunity and fail to recognize the value of our more primitive instincts.<br /><br />Read THE LOG OF A COWBOY and see if you don't also wonder.

I bought my copy at a small store in Cairo, Egypt and devoured it.<br />The layout is appealing but a bit too appealing for my taste - a little too liberal with the color in areas that do nothing to enhance the sound advice within.<br />I've read many books on retailing and even owned a couple businesses myself. This book is better than most and I especially appreciated the explanation on location for your retail business. These authors explain why one type of location will work for a certain class of business, but not for another class - I've not found many writers that explain this differentiation, but it is of especial importance.<br />I rated this book four stars, but 4-1/2 would be more fair. The book is a good introduction but is skewed a little too sharply towards chain stores and franchises.

Not since reading Three Against The Wilderness or Crusoe of Lonesome Lake have I found such a great, true, adventure story. Correction - I have never before come across such a great story.<br />Make no mistake about it, this is one of those books that, if you are fortunate enough to find stuck in some far flung second hand bookstore, you will devour every word.<br />Wolhuter matter-of-factly explains his life from about age 10 when his adventures began in a South Africa that was every bit as wild as the American West, but with the added dangers of lions, hyenas and other dangerous beasts.<br />Those of you expecting to read something derogatory about the natives though will be sadly disappointed. Wolhuter, in fact, obviuously was not blinded by prejudice for he was not fooled by rumors of uprisings that turned out to be false. Fortunately, though, Wolhuter spends no time discussing the natives and far less discussing the politics of the time that led to the Boer War and so forth. Indeed, although he did fight for the British side, one imagines through his narrative, that he could almost as easily fought for the Boer side, such is his empathy for friends and his antipathy for politics.<br />I found his investigation of the scene following a lion kill of a native woman and her child to be riveting - surpassed only by his account of his own harrowing escape from death by two lions.<br />Memories of a Game Ranger is a must read. Hollywood will discover this story soon and make it into a blockbuster, perhaps starring Kevin Costner or Harrison Ford.	2003-08-11

Understand first, unlike Asimov, I am a true believer. As such I feel it is incumbent to gain a true understanding of just exactly what it is God wants of us and for us.<br />This means that as I read any given passage of the Holy Bible that I not get myself caught into the trap of so many other believers - in other words,, I will not say to others that such and such is true simply because, &quot;...it says so in the Bible.&quot;<br />I am frequently annoyed that so many Christians don't understand Jesus's purpose. He wanted us to understand and live to the intent of God's Commandments and not to simply follow the letter of the word with ceremonies in precisely this way or that.<br />I found Asimov's treatise to give me a terrific understanding and especially appreciate his explanation of the meaning of names for various people and places.<br />Asimov makes a very good point to many of us who falsely believed the first Jews were slaves building the pyramids in Egypt. He does so without malice but with a matter-of-fact discussion of the fact that the structures were not once mentioned in the Bible.<br />He also enlightens us as to precisely where in Egypt Moses and his followers lived and, perhaps most crucially, explains the simultaneous transfer of the first Philistines to roughly the same region as Moses's followers and the fact that at that time neither group seems to have been antagonistic towards one another.<br />Only later, as each group grew in population and as the various outside intruders dissipated (Hyksos, Hittites, Egyptians) did the two come to despise each other.<br />Asimov also especially provides a good insight into several New Testament stories that seem to have been rehashed Old Testament stories.<br />It is natural for many to disagree with me. I respect those of you who do. My point is that my belief and faith depends not on miracles or the words of the Bible. It depends on my belief in the goodness of mankind. It depends on my belief in forgiveness of sins that came when He sacrificed Himself on the cross. It depends on all of us seeking His truth so we can do His will.

I returned to work in Egypt in April 2000 and, for some inexplicable reason, had a hankering to see the movie upon which this book was based. Aware that such a desire was pointless, I started searching high and low for the book - pestering associates and bookshops throughout Cairo.<br /><br />Then, the Vatican, according to CNN, announced that the never-before-revealed secret third prophecy had indeed come to fruition - the attempt on the Pope's life May 13, 1981. (This interpretation was agreed to by the main witness of the events, now a nun!)<br /><br />Wow...uncanny that I was at the same time looking for the book. After months searching I found this book.

UPDATED REVIEW: As I stated in my original review, this book was enthralling and read very much like a novel. However, it appears the writer may have taken greater poetic license than he admitted to when it was first published. I hope someday he will re-write it just as the two people saw the mountain.<br /><br />I found it nearly impossible to put this book down.<br /><br />I have thrice visited the traditional Mt. Sinai and have myself concluded that, although a beautiful sight, the traditional mountain cannot possibly be the mountain Moses received the commandments. It is not even the highest peak in the immediate area.<br /><br />Thus, it is not so far-fetched for me to succomb to this reputed discovery. Still, I asked friends and associates in the Middle East their thoughts. Many Christians disagree with me, but many Moslems agree that this book could be correct, for they grew up with stories that indicated Moses (Musa) had lived for a time in the area highlighted by the book.<br />I do wish the author had not consolidated certain facts. I also do still have some skepticism in certain parts, for some conspiratorial type data is not adequately sourced.	2003-07-20

Messers Garment and Dean both have written intelligent, insightful commentaries regarding who the hero was that may have stopped the nation's political slide into \\"might makes right\\" government of, by and for elected leaders.<br />Okay, perhaps it only ended up sending our government into a nation ruled by lawyers and corporations, but, at least it has not become subject to the whim of just one elected man or woman.<br />Funny thing is, both Garment and Dean seem to have overlooked the one most likely candidate. If you read both Garment and Dean's studies, then re-read All The President's Men, then consider the following, I think you can easily see why I am certain Deep Throat is George Herbert Walker Bush.<br />Height is correct. GHW Bush is a tall man.<br />Speaking in a lawyerlese fashion? Recall Bush's refusal to allow John Anderson in the New Hampshire debate in 1980 was based on compliance with the rules. Also recall Bush saying, regarding Iran-Contra, that he was 'not in the loop.' Both could conceivably be the stand of one who used such a phrase as, \\"...corroborating evidence.\\"<br />And how many people do you know who could lose a run for senate, then go on to become first US representative to China, Chairman of the Republican Party (who told Pres. Nixon, 'You have to resign...') then head of the CIA, then vice president, then President and father of another.<br />Then, recall his statement during all the fuss about his son's election and the court battle: He said something and the manner in which he spoke reminded me so much of Deep Throats mannerisms and speech.<br />Understand, I voted for neither Bush for President. However, because I am convinced of the elder's patriotism and that he truly always did what he honestly felt was right for the USA, and because I believe he did help us remove an evil administration (by this I mostly mean those around Nixon that led him down a tragic path) and because I am sure he also spilled a lot of insider information regard Iran-Contra, I have immense respect for George Herbert Walker Bush.<br />Mark my words.

I doubt I shall ever come across a better writer of history or Science Fiction in this lifetime.<br />Asimov was a great student of history, psychology, and science. Unlike most students and academics, though, Asimov also was a superb writer in each area and could distill the essence of his knowledge into entertaining non-fiction or fiction. Read his books regarding history of civilization or about Black Holes or about religion and I'm sure you will appreciate his knowledge about such diverse topics and his ability to keep you awake at night reading!<br />I'm not saying you will agree with his every point - only that you will be exposed to a well-articulated discussion.<br />In the Foundation series, it is clear Asimov has combined history and psychology to an extraordinary degree. The question is, was this young man of Russian birth writing of Russia's future or was he merely writing of England's past?<br />You see, a great civilization has encompassed all the known world. Then, inevitably, it will begin a collapse. As in other empires, collapse begins in part due to the burdensome administrative hub (Moscow, Washington DC or London?), combined with a recession at a time when the outcast and downtrodden are fed up with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of a better future (Eastern Europe or the inner cities of America or Britain). This dilemma is further exacerbated by revolutionaries and terrorists in the hinterlands.<br />Enter Mr. Seldon. Clearly he is based on the alter ego of Asimov himself, for the man is a student of mathematics, psychology, religion and history, as well as of politics.<br />I could write a book to dissect the brilliance of the writing and the lessons for all leaders, but will simply say that Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation make up my favorite all-time trilogy. No knock against Lord of the Rings intended. LOTR is terrific but not quite as good.	2003-07-01

While reading this book, I lived in Cairo, Egypt. Actually, I lived there and worked quite near the American embassy. Had Grisham at least visited Cairo and toured the area he would have known a key premise would be impossible. I can't explain because I don't like spoilers.<br /><br />What also hurt this book is that Grisham seems to think you can view a few clips of CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and get inside a terrorist's mind. If that were even remotely possible, our CIA would have vanquished all the world's terrorists. Although I agree with many that what terrorists do by murdering, at random, innocent men, women and babies is horribly unGodly, the way to portray such villains is not to stereotype them. Get deeper into their mindset --- kind of what Donnie Brasco did, he got inside the mind of a Goodfella better than any writer I can imagine.<br /><br />That is not to say that The Brethren was devoid of a good plot. It just was poorly executed and had lousy character development, plus the premise was faulty.<br /><br />If readers still want to read The Brethren, all I can say is, good luck.	2003-06-30

There was a time when people thrived in living among, not against, nature. There was a time when people reveled in a world without television, mobile (or cellular) phones, television or computers. Sorry messers Gates, Jobs, et al, there really was such a time!<br />Ralph Williams's story seems now to be only great fiction, for his feats are every bit as phenomenal as are those now shown on the big screen. Still, even though they may seem to be fiction, I can assure you they are most certainly true. Furthermore, great as they were, his successes were not that far different from many other folks of that time.<br />My grandfather emigrated to North America from Norway about the same time Williams moved to Canada's British Columbia. In fact, while he trapped in B.C. Grandfather may well have met Williams. Anyway, grandfather married after a few years and moved to California where he tried to homestead a quarter section that is now part of a famous ranch on a fork of the Kern River in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.<br />Alas, the Great Depression happened along and Grandpa was told by his kin to either homestead, or stay working at their glass factory in South Gate in southeast Los Angeles. For the sake of his family he gave up the homestead and told fellow homesteaders goodbye.<br />That winter a terrible blizzard struck the homesteaders. Grandpa raced his motorcycle the few hundred miles to the foothills of the mountains. He then cross-country ski'd food to the stranded folks - covering a distance of 17 miles from valley floor (perhaps 2,000 foot elevation) to the farmers at some 8,000 foot high. Such a feat is reminiscent of Williams in this great classic Crusoe of Lonesome Lake.<br />After you read this book, get a copy of Three Against The Wilderness by Eric Collier.

Now, all three are quickly disappearing from our libraries.<br /><br />Three Against is a heart-warming story of one Britisher finding himself in a remote area of Canada's British Columbia. In a search for a life he could enjoy among nature, he finds a badly damaged remote tract of land and decides to make a life for himself and his new wife (Native American) by restoring nature's grandeur by introducing beaver.<br /><br />The story is one of courage and sacrifice and helps explain not only the early days of conservation but of how one man could make a difference in his environment by acting locally. Margaret Meade would have been proud as punch.<br /><br />After you read this book, read Go North Young Man by Gordon Stoddard, and Crusoe of Lonesome Lake. You will probably do as I and keep a copy for reading every couple of years to remind yourself you can dream, you can improve your world, and you can enjoy living without too greatly harming the environment - C. William Anderson.	2003-06-30

Now, perhaps I loved it because it was not assigned to me, but because I checked it out of the school library.<br />At any rate, I doubt a better novel will ever be written. The only novel to equal Shane is Old Yeller.<br />I'm working on my own novel, Hear Me Whimper, Feel My Pain (about Arabia after T.E. Lawrence) and can  only hope to elicit a small portion of the emotion from readers that either Shane or Old Yeller yanked out of my heart.<br />To be sure, there are a lot of good, heart-wrenching stories available. Where The Red Fern Grows, Gentle Ben come quickly to mind. Shane, though, and Old Yeller, are the top two stories of all time. In print, audio, or video, either of them will touch any open-minded person's heart.	2003-06-30

As previous publisher of a magazine for people wanting to return to nature I had read the original book many years ago. This edition is a vast improvement with some 80 pages of additional information and it has been updated to reflect current practices.<br />If you are considering raising dairy goats primarily for your family milk needs, or as a part-time supplemental income, this book is perfect for you.<br />If you want to expand later into making dairy goats your primary income, you will want to add Goat Husbandry. Goat Husbandry has two basic flaws - it is more highly technical and it is intended mostly for the UK.<br />Belanger's book would be more complete and would eliminate my need for Goat Husbandry if only the following two issues had been more thoroughly covered:<br />1 - Provide income projections for several classes of commercial dairy goat operations. Perhaps a chapter of 40 pages would be needed to do the topic justice, but if done properly, commercial dairy goats could become more accepted by the financial community and, therefore, could promote the practice.<br />2 - Provide a chapter showing, say, three dairies that meet the requirements of Grade A. Yes, it is a widely variable regulation even within a single state, but at least readers could gain a better understanding of the costs, design and implementation to achieve such status. Perhaps even interviews of the operators could be included in a manner similar to Gail Bowman's humorous phone chats with Annette Maze in Raising Meat Goats For Profit.<br />The two points above are not meant as criticism, for, as I stated, Belanger has done a great job with this book. I'm just wishing he could add the two points above so I could make room on my bookshelf by discarding Goat Husbandry. Further, although Goat Husbandry does provide some information on commercial dairying with goats, it itself is not especially thorough on the topic and, further, is so dedicated to costs and incomes in Britain that it is not very useful for North America.<br />Hmmm...perhaps there is yet room in the market for yet another goat book. Say, &quot;Commercial Dairy Goats in Canada and The U.S.A.&quot; Get busy Jerry or I'll write it!<br />I am certainly pleased with Belanger's Raising Dairy Goats and will keep it on the same shelf as Goat Husbandry and Raising Meat Goats For Profit. With these three, my goat library is nearly complete.<br />Incidentally: Belanger formerly published Countryside &amp; Small Stock Journal, perhaps the best ever magazine for small livestock farmers. It is now run, I think, by his kids and you can view it on the web.ot very useful for North America.<br />Hmmm...perhaps there is yet room in the market for yet another goat book.

Speaking frankly, I used to smirk at the series of books titled &quot;Raising _______ The Modern Way.&quot;<br />Too few of them were useful. Belanger's Dairy Goats and Simmons's Raising Sheep were the only two exceptions. Of course, that was then, a time when books for folks returning to nature just weren't common. Now, as more books are available, it seems Storey's has decided to improve their entire line.<br />The result is that Storey's Guides are now really excellent and provide a great deal of useful information. This is especially true with Raising Sheep.<br />Among the numerous books for prospective sheep ranchers I choose this as the best, most complete useful book for the small farmer.	2003-06-29

I have a good deal of familiarity with the Arabs, but not nearly enough.<br />I am a safety manager in construction and have worked some in the West Bank and visited shops in Israel. Further, I am married into a family with roots in the conflict. My wife's grandfather was a Lebanese, but employed in 1915 as Consul to Turkey by the country we now call Iran. Possessing diplomatic immunity, Rafiq Habib Jabbour helped Feisal escape the Turks to help lead the revolt written extensively by T.E. Lawrence.<br />Rafiq would later help lead a revolt against British occupation of Egypt. Upon release from prison Rafiq returned to Lebanon, then headed to Palestine to lead a revolt against the Brits. Shortly thereafter he was apparently poisoned.<br />Back to my main point. The prejudice within this book is apparent when the author so rudely dismisses the Arab revolt against the Turks and then goes on to show only the negative side of the Palestinian cause.<br />Having said that, I still did find much useful insight into the roots of the problem still haunting us all. That, my friends, is that there simply was a common bond, in times past, between wage-earning Palestinians and wage-earning Israelites.<br />Likewise, the businessmen (Israelite and Arab) were united against the working class due to a fear the world would be overtaken by Communism. Pity the wealthy class failed to recognize that belief in God precludes devotion to any earthly authority.	2003-06-27

More important, Gail Bowman is obviously experienced in the craft she writes about and her love of the most cantankerous of farm critters shows through.<br />This is one of the few chatty how-to books that I have found did not waste even a page of type.<br />No matter the topic, it is apparent Ms Bowman has learned from experience and is unafraid to tell us her mistakes as well as her successes. But, she is not preachy and doesn't try to convince us there is only one way. She freely informs us of methods and techniques, and even other breeds, reported to her by other breeders.<br />I had long thought the best way to try and make a living with goats would be as a dairy, but, milking a hundred goats can be mighty tiring for a bare living. Thus, I was considering meat goats after downloading some introductory blurbs published by the Saskatchewan Ag folks.<br />I, however, remained skeptical of meat goats for profit. I was concerned I might be getting into a branch of agriculture for dreamers (the visionary sort, no disrespect meant) but, at age 50, I just don't feel the hankering to blaze any new trails. In other words, I want to let today's youth do the experimenting. I just want to earn money to sock away for my retirement.<br />Well, Ms Bowman has done a great job in showing me that meat goats are not the 21st Century equivalent of ostrich, emu, elk, deer and bison. They are a viable farm product that can produce a reasonable income without having to create a new market or without having to depend on other breeders for one's profit.<br />I nominate Raising Meat Goats For Profit as one of the Best How-To books for the 21st Century!<br />If I were still publishing farm magazines I would definitely be shouting the news to my readers. Raising Meat Goats For Profit is a masterpiece.	2003-06-22

Finally, exasperated, I surrendered and bought a Mac iBook in Cairo, Egypt, even though almost no individual in this country uses one.<br />This iBook is running on Jaguar. In other words, it runs on system 9 (of which I am well-experienced), and system X in which I have not a clue! To make a long story short, I bought Mac OS X Jaguar Hands-on Training because I was having troubles trying to re-learn 9 and to learn to use X in a manner similar to 9.<br />The explanation of the differences between 9 and X helped bail me out of deep schisms I was falling towards.<br />The training in iLife programs, especially iTunes, iPhoto and iCalendar has given a deep appreciation for Apple - the corporation that knows how to provide a real system and computer for people who want to get a mission accomplished instead of impressing folks with how computer literate they are. In other words, engineers will use Windows, managers, writers and editors will use Mac.<br />This book is a quick read despite its 800-plus pages. The included lessons and examples on the accompanying CD are extremely helpful, especially for my wife, Dina, who has never used a MAC!<br />Allow me to use a metaphor. God made man in His image. Eventually, man made computers in his image - that is the MAC.<br />Mac is a Godsend.

Then, the prospective youth might whet his or her appetite sufficiently to choose a more complete book.<br />I did find the illustrations and photos to be helpful, but if the cost for such artwork resulted in shrinking the font size down to a barely legible size, then probably some of the pictures should be removed. Even many youth will have trouble reading such small type!<br />The booklet covers a lot of ground with brevity. Thus, it is a quick read,<br />However, although the potential for sheep raising for milk production is heavily promoted in the advertisement, our kind author does a great disservice regarding milking sheep on page 52:<br />&quot;The teats of sheep are much smaller than those of cows and goats. This makes milking them harder because you can use only a couple of fingers rather than the entire hand (see colr photo on page 55). There is no point in describing in detail how to milk a sheep because it is a skill that must be acquired through practice.&quot;<br />Illustrations and photos and a bit of imagination could have seized a golden opportunity here. If it is that difficult to explain that is precisely what the author should have tried.<br />Although I did find the book not to be informative enough for me, I do think it would be a great e-book for a free download. Perhaps a short video clip could be included to show how sheep are milked. As such, the PDF could serve as a loss-leader in attracting readers to purchasing more complete books on sheep and livestock production.<br />Again, this book is best thought of as a FFA gift for teens interested in raising sheep on a small scale.

A prospective store operator needs to understand how to setup his or her store and, just as important, how their competition operates. Beginning store operators also need to understand their industry in detail not merely from the viewpoint of their competition and from their customers, but from their suppliers position.<br />Gourmet To Go does a great job from a narrow viewpoint. Probably the only topic not suffriciently explored is the hands'-on advice. Perhaps the next edition will detail the possibilities for including rollergrills, microwaves and how to earn what the industry refers to as \\"Plus-sales.\\" I'm speaking of the technique in all fast food chains and convenience stores to get customers to spend more money.<br />Other hands-on topics that should be discussed are controlling theft and the experience of many store operators who have lost significant chunks of money in providing lottery tickets. I know of a feww whose losses exceeded $10,000. Adding insult to injury, lottery only reimburses stores from one to three percent of gross sales and pay-outs for winning tickets.

Okay, let me get this off my chest. I started with the first home computers (remember the TRS80 4K? I recall a Bill Gates article in Compute! where Mr. Gates lamented his failure to monopolize BASIC programming.<br /><br />I graduated to Texas Instruments and Compaq and the classic Osborne. Then, I embraced the PC and chuckled at the toy with a mouse.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter I used my first Mac. Until 18 months ago I swore I'd never again use a PC. Working overseas, though, has forced me to return, as Macs are not readily available in Egypt.<br /><br />Biggest difference between Mac and Pc? I never consulted a manual to learn how to use the Mac. It is instinctive.<br />Second biggest difference? In some 16 years of using a Mac the only time it ever crashed was because of frequent power outages in rural Oregon and my not having Norton Utilities.<br /><br />Alas, now that I am back on a PC (until my return stateside) I have found the weekly freeze-ups and crashes demand I consult the reference manuals. Just as is Windows, the manual is confusing and almost too heavy to take aboard an airbus as a carry-on, but it is necessary. With patience you will find your answer.<br /><br />At nearly 1,000 pages I wonder how many acres of rain forest Gates has forced to be cut down though!<br /><br />This book is the best trouble shooter for Windows 98.<br /><br />UPDATE - by 2010 Macintosh computers were back in Egypt and, boosted by iPods, iPhones and iPads since then, Macs have been selling good at several locations in the greater Cairo area. In 2013 I returned stateside with two Mac Minis bought in Egypt and hope never to return to the looney world of Windows.	2003-05-07

If you're the sort who likes to buy software and then use it without consulting the manual you probably own a Mac.

And the accompanying manual is as confusing as some passages in the Bible!<br />If you're one of the rest of us and have bought an Adobe product, I advise you to get the Classroom In A Book tutorial.

I've read the fifth edition and found it to not have the number of typos other reviewers found in the 7th Ed., so I presume the typos were intentional as is common among publishers to protect their copyrights.<br />At any rate, this book is intended for the journalism student. It can get somewhat dry. In such a setting one can't expect cotton candy and Reese Peanut Butter Cups!<br />The people that can best benefit by reading this text are the people at your local weekly newspaper and the reporters for Fox News Corporation. Objectivity and source attribution are sadly lacking at many community newspapers, at Fox News and at Al Jazeera. Okay, that's a bit harsh. But I digress.<br />When I was younger I obtained more than two years college credit simply by obtaining business books, reading them, and working each and every exercise at the end of each chapter and then taking College Level Eaxamintions through CLEP. This book is one in which the reader could do likewise and obtain at least sufficient knowledge to earn one year credit.<br />Then, even if you choose not to enter the workforce as a news gatherer, writer or editor, at least you would have an appreciation for the process.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone involved in writing news or features or for those who interface with newspeople.	2003-05-06

When I owned a small bakery in the Oregon Cascades I developed a line of savory pies in part by using information included within this book.

Before I discuss this book, readers should know I have probably read fewer Stephen King Horror novels than any living American. I have little time for his epics - I prefer to watch the movie versions.<br />Why? Most novels I read need to be less than 150 pages or I lose interest. I see a 300 page novel and I fear I'll get bogged down with descriptions of yet another unique acacia tree or that sun's ray with some peculiar glow. I'm not accusing King of having done so in his novels, it is just that I remember too many of those books from when I was a youth in the 60s.<br />Besides, I am more of a non-fiction buff. That was why the first Stephen King book I have ever read cover-to-cover is On Writing - A Memoir Of The Craft.<br />This is a terrific book that honestly discusses the inner needs a budding author must have without wasting too much time discussing the nuts and bolts.<br />King once wrote, &quot;I write because I cannot not write.&quot; This has always stuck in my mind.<br />In On Writing King mentions that good writers are good readers. The man goes nowhere without a book close at hand and an audiobook in his car.<br />That comment is worth reams of advice. I know far too many writers who seldom read even one book a year but think they are qualified to write a best-selling novel. Whatever your interest, it can't but make for a more compelling book if you have read a dozen or more similar books.<br />His advice on how to write active, instead of passive was also beneficial. Just as does King confess, I tend to be unsure as to whether I am understood and thusly(!), revert to the &quot;ly&quot; verb. If you're confused by this line you won't be after reading On Writing.<br />His frank discussion of telepathy and comparison to the same is a breath of fresh air. In many ways writing is telepathy. Some will scoff at his free acceptance of telepathy and the psychic phenomena. Not me though. I know for a fact it is for real. At least sometimes for some of us.<br />Still, even if readers don't ascribe to esp, if they can imagine that they are sending their thoughts into the future to someone thousands of miles away, they will then have the necessary imagination to convey their musings with just the right amount of description.<br />I appreciate that King did not bog us down with the discussion of how to plot a story. Good stories are usually what-ifs and King points this out. He also opens us to how most good stories are inspired by blending two or more common but isolated observations. Carrie was such a story.<br />Within 288 pages King has masterfully shown aspiring writers how to:<br />1 - Write an autobiography (his, with just the right amount of humor and tragedy).<br />2 - How to develop idea-driven fiction not overladen with detail and description.<br />3 - How to write a concise article in reverse pyramid style (his encounter with a van that nearly killed him.<br />The man did this without preaching and without overly stressing the value of this secret or that secret.<br />No aspiring fiction writer should be without this book. No journalist should fail to keep it in his or her personal library.<br />King does not claim to be a genius. Nor, probably, is he. His ability to simply explain the basics of the craft and to provide simple examples without preaching and without mind-boggling details proves that.<br />For those of us who want to write but are intimidated by the brilliance of writing geniuses, a simple discussion and down-to-earth advice is what we need.<br />King's On Writing is precisely the book we need.<br />I have both the print version and the audio narrated by Stephen King.

It is thorough, and written in friendly language.<br />Cardoza has not overwhelmed us with statistics, but has provided the sort of helpful information we must have for preparing our book, pricing it, and obtaining printers and putting it all in a form consistent with our market.<br />So valuable did I once find it that, just before departing to a job in Africa, I scanned the entire contents into my computer through OCR software so I could read it. I did so because my local bookstores didn't have a copy in stock and I didn't have long enough to wait for them to get it. Thus, I did all the grudge work using a library copy. A year later, while home on vacation, I had a copy waiting for me at the local bookstore.<br />Until I learned Amazon.com really could ship books to Egypt I got my books only when I got lucky in Cairo or when I went home on vacation.<br />This is a great book for the self-publisher. It is an even better book for the person wanting to enter the field and publish books written by others.<br />Poynters' books are okay. So are many of the others in the field.

It's a shame the two couldn't get together and combine both views!<br />What I found of less value was the chapter about raising money and managing employees. Frankly, such topics could be removed and the book would suffer no a whit.<br />She did a great job discussing internet publishing and should expand on the topic in the next edition.<br />Cheryl was a co-founder of PC Magazine and MacWorld and certainly understands the business aspects.

Four examples:<br />1 - The first 20 years of the region's decoupling from Turkey is inadequately discussed;<br />2 - Faisel Husseini, the man T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) chose as his key to launching the WWI revolt) was assisted in escaping the Turks by Lebanese-born Rafiq Habib Gabour, the 20-year-old consul on behalf of Persia to Turkey;<br />3 - Rafiq Habib Gabour dedicated his life to evicting Britain from Egypt and from Palestine, yet is not mentioned in the book;<br /><br />4 - Working-class Jews and Arabs of the region worked together to improve their working conditions, wages, and political freedoms. Yet, not one line to this effect is uttered. This is key, for those in power and those with a financial stake in the area may possibly have driven a wedge between the two groups for which the entire world is now paying a stiff price!<br />The organization also could be much improved. Trying to find information on particular people, such as Faisel, or his brother Abdullah, or their father King Hussein of the Hegaz, is a bit of a meandering trail.<br />Despite these shortcomings, this book is quite useful and remarkably free of bias that leads any reader into a particular judgement. It is a must for anyone wishing to gain a fair insight to Palestine and Israel.<br />I highly recommend the book to any individual wishing to gain an insight into the development of the region and the seeds of the current strife.
