Sheen	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Great book, especially for priests	This is a wonderful book showing how a priest can live in the world, yet not become a &quot;worldling&quot;.  His sanctity is shown by his brilliant writing styling and his description of his life.  Despite struggles of all kinds, Archbishop Sheen persevered, trying to fulfill God's Will in his life to the fullest.  He is a very learned man, and a great apologist for those looking for information regarding Catholic apologetics.  But one of the things that most amazed me about Sheen is his ability to love Jesus, and be able to find Him in the world and in sinners, trying his hardest to bring God into their life and thus, the world.  If you're looking for an inspirational book for your parish priest, this would be a great selection, if he has not read it, because I'm sure this priest will one day become a Saint.	2001-02-08

This story, an account of St. Therese of Lisieux's life from what she remembers, is extraordinary.  I have read many biographies, but none have been interesting and inspirational at the same time like this one is.  Her stories of past faults brings comfort to those overwhelmed by sins they have committed, for it shows us that even the greatest of Saints are still sinners, and the lowliest of all in their own eyes.  I suggest this book to all looking for consolation and a great read.	2001-01-28
US	48724414	R271KNF2DZ83TF	0898705975	646919406	The World's First Love	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Marvelous book on Marian doctrine	The late Archbishop Fulton Sheen pulls together common misconceptions various religions have about the Catholic Church's beliefs about Mary, and gives insights and Biblical reasons why Catholics honor her so greatly.  There is also a chapter I found really informative on &quot;Mary and the Moslems&quot; which tells about the Islamic beliefs of Mary, i.e. that she is to be the most honored of women and that the Koran speaks of Mary and the Virgin Birth of Jesus.  This book would be wonderful for those wishing for a greater love for Our Blessed Mother, as well as those Protestants who mistakingly think Mary should be less revered and those beginning their conversion to Catholicism.	2001-01-17

(American Storytelling)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Comedic anecdotal collection	This collection of Mr. Stivender's memories from his first year in Catholic school all the way up to his prom was very funny.  I have never been to a parochial school myself, but from what my father has told me about his memories, these stories give a taste of what Catholic schools were like in the 1950's, but in a hilarious manner.	2001-01-13

I think this would be for someone entering the Catholic Church, or for those who have been away from the Church for some time now, but I don't think it's written in the way it should be for welcoming souls into the Church that Christ established.  I would suggest reading another book and being well-grounded in your Faith before reading this, because there's nothing you're missing in here.	2001-01-13

These words of our Pope, however, have significance even to those over the age of 10.  I highly recommend this book for First Communicants and for all other Catholic children, because had I had this book when I was younger, I would probably not have fallen into as many traps as I did.	2001-01-06

The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because he repeats some things that he covers in other books of his.	2000-12-31

He speaks of apparitions of angels and stories of various Saints who have been blessed with seeing the presence of their angels at all times.  He tells us of the greatness of our angels' love for us, and that they are willing to help us with ANYTHING we want if we ask them.  Great book for all those seeking the truth about angels and for clearing up common misconceptions the world has.	2000-12-30

After spending many years in the darkness of sin, Thomas converted to Catholicism and ultimately, a Trappist monastery.  His story was really inspirational, and has nurtured my possible vocation to the Trappist life.  This book would be a great read for ALL kinds of people: senior citizens, atheists, Catholics, and Protestants.	2000-12-29

This book shows the unestimable graces we receive each time we participate in the Sacrifice of the Mass. It tells us how much more blessed we are than the angels, because they can't receive the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity that we receive every Sunday and often take for granted.  I recomment this for Priests to read as a homily on a day when many are in attendance, because this will get people coming to church as often as they can.	2000-12-29

It covers widely known apparitions such as Lourdes, Fatima, and Guadaloupe as well as less familiar ones.  This book, I would say, is an introduction for those who want to study Marian apparitions in depth.  It briefly summarizes the accounts, and provides SOME testimony from the visonaries themselves.  The best part of the book, I think, is the beautiful artwork of Mary through the ages that are shown on every other page.	2000-12-22

US	48724414	RHVSST7RUUWJQ	0345397452	370314504	A Simple Path	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Uplifting book by a true Mother	Mother Teresa...everytime the name is heard, thoughts come to mind about her love for the poor, her charity for the suffering and the dying, and above all, her faith and love for God.  This book is another compilation of Mother Teresa and her Sisters' and Brothers' thoughts, beliefs, stories, etc.  This was an excellent book that spiritually helped me.  I wasn't even fully done with the book and I saw a change in my life.  Mother Teresa's words of love and charity made me see that I should love as Jesus loves, not as what I think feels good.  And if I did something wrong, I could envision Mother Teresa nodding her head and telling me to do better next time, as a true mother would.  Excellent book &quot;for Catholics and non-Catholics alike,&quot; as the book jacket says.	2000-12-21

The charisms he was blessed with by the Holy Spirit are truly amazing to read about, including bilocation, the odor of sanctity, as well as his most famous gift, the stigmata.  The accounts of miracles attributed to his intercession are unbelieveable, and I'm sure they're just a small amount of the great deeds this man has done.  This man seems MORE than a man, forgetting to eat meals, having great favor with the Lord, and sometimes being invisible from others.  He comforted many dying souls in their last agony.  This is a great compilation of the wonders of the great Blessed Padre Pio.	2000-12-19

Quite the contrary, I was amazed by the reality of this story.  James Ullman does an excellent job, making the reader feel like he's in the story himself.

Some of the stories are boring, while others are fairly exciting.  Politically speaking, Mr. O'Reilly offers some good insights and solutions to some problems that face society today.  Religiously speaking, a large portion of his opinions are contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church.  I got kinda of bored during the middle of the book, reading it for the sake of finishing the book, and no other, but he regained my attention during the last three or four chapters.	2000-12-18

I found SOME in this book, but I would suggest looking in other places.  The first chapter or two are a virtually meaningless introduction to St. Francis of Assisi.  The story of his life is pretty good, but under the classification of a biography, it lacks the biographical data needed for that title.	2000-11-08
