Whenever I am down, I pick up this book and laugh myself back into a good mood.  The illustrations are hilarious especially the moose in cowboy boots.  This is a real change from ordinary alphabet books- because the joke is on the reader.  Someone observant sees its the animals doing the actions that are the real word that corresponds with the letter.

With the compression of memory the leopard, matial eagle and serpent were blended into the dragon.This idea occured to him when he was preparing a lecture on the alarm calls of vervet monkeys.   As Dr. Jones points out in this thoroughly researched book- every culture has dragons myths.  This book is a combination of myth, anthropology and sociology.  Dr. Jones as a professor of Anthropology at the University of Central Florida has done an excellent job of explaining the phenonomen of the dragon. This book is very engaging.  I have been a student of folklore for many years and found that Dr. Jones told me of new dragons I had never found in other sources.	2001-04-04

Robert Cormier is a compelling author. he never takes the easy road- each story forces the reader to face the inner self.  In Fade we confront the idea of what we would do if we could become invisible. Adding the editor  with her doubts, balances out the preposterousness of the idea... yet  Cormier in telling the story of Paul tells the story of the dark side in  each of us. I read this in two days because I wanted to know if Paul could  save his successor from the terror her felt when he first learned he could  vanish. I would offer this book to any teen I felt was trying to make  choices and is wondering about what direction his/or her life will take.  Cormier is unflinchingly realistic and knows the cruelty in the world- and  his books reflect that but also bring hope.	1998-12-03

Fade is one of the most disturbing and riveting novels I have ever read. Paul and his family know the secret of some of the members that can become invisible but refuse to face it. By introducing the publisher and  granddauther into the story the credibility of Paul's story comes into  question. Cormier never shies away from violence and fear- these elements  are present in each of his stories. Stephen King said it best when he  described Fade as a cross between Holden Caulfield and the invisible man.  Tis most makes the reader question what he would do if he had this power-  would the invisibility unlease the darker side of our natures? Older teens  and adults would find this a great book for discussion.	1998-11-29

Spinelli has captured the terror Palmer feels as he approaches the age when he can be a wringer.  His 'friends' are well drawn as boys who both initmidate and fascinate him.   The tension in this book is palatable. I read it at one sitting because I  had to know how Palmer made his decision. This is a thoughful book for  middle schoolers. Everything works in this book, the parents, the  &quot;girl&quot; next door and Palmer himself.  I also felt I knew more  about pigeons after the descrition of Nippers daily rituals.

Like another reviewer- the reader should understand this is really like those made up letters to Penthouse- not that there is anything wrong with the imagination of sex...  It definitely is titatlating.... and they have more ways to describe genetalia than Heinz has pickles...	1998-06-10
US	53055712	ROBWTN2F1Y0RT	087483130X	426500369	Listening for the Crack of Dawn	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Well written tales of the life in a small town.	Donald Davis is the perfect storyteller. He knows how to blend the joys and sorrows of life together in a satisfying mix. LSMFT is funny and The last Butler in sulfer Springs reveals the dark secrets each town has.  Most of all Different Drummer is a shocking tale- but it captures the real anguish of vietnam.  I have met Mr. Davis and he is as affable as his tales. He is even better on audio- you can hear the joy of life in his voice.	1998-06-10
US	53055712	R1C48HAMYJPTN7	0140148620	140266945	Spontaneous Combustion	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Irreverent and serious look at AIDS impact	While Eighty-sixed was raw and frank, Spontaneous Combustion is more serious because it faces the AIDS epidemic. B.J. is a character much like the author who wrote me before his death. Irreverent, outrageous and in the middle of history.	1998-06-10

B.F. is a book that shows the classes that live next to each other every day. From the queen's elaborate &quot;toilette&quot; to the servants ignominious treatment. The merchant though rich is not spared the pain of lonliness. Most of all it shows how (with syncronicity) each of us touch others every day.  Six may go to the fair but only 5 return. Stolz paints a rememberable picture of life in England.	1998-06-06

Before Ted Bundy there was Bluebeard. Before a woman sued Mcdonalds for hot coffee burns- there were bakers who tried to sue customers for simply smelling bread. Also King Solomon had to decide the fate of a baby long before Baby M made the news.  The stories in this book are well written, good for telling (I have done so at a middle school) and great lessons to learn. Parents and teachers can make use of this book to let story (not moralizing) teach the next generation.	1998-06-02
US	53055712	R2ETTCRD2A64F1	0316779423	685145331	Barrel Fever: Stories and Essays	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Weird, funny and original!	Sedaris grabbed my attention with his radio pieces. His humor is so original I keep this book by my bed- so if I've had a hard day I can reread &quot;The Last you'll hear from me&quot; or &quot; Diary of a Smoker&quot; and laugh at the world and its quirks. Sedaris certainly has a penchant for seeing the absurdities of the world- he's sort of like both the Coen brother of print. This book proves he is one of the weirdest and funniest writers around .	1998-05-29
US	53055712	R3MMJRTRKEHQZ2	0752211900	480214096	Uncaged: The Biography of Nicholas Cage	Books	1	3	4	N	N	Uncaged is a hack job-this actor deserved better!	I have seen every Nick Cage movie, and did extensive research before I wrote a paper on him for a fine arts class. Douglas Thompson should be ashamed of his terrible writing- it is cliche ridden,and full of trite observances. I recognized most of his quotes coming from the articles in G.Q. Film Quarterly and Vanity Fair. Cage is much too complex a person, and much too fine an actor to have this hack job to represent him.  The author doesn't even have a complete filmography- left out a short Lynch and a Tempo di uccidere(1990)which he made in Italy The avid Cage fan will be disappointed- only for those who know nothing about him.	1998-05-28
US	53055712	R3H8UQDZSZ42LL	0140178929	475704212	Nude Men: A Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Off-beat look at men, nymphets, cats and artists	I couldn't read this book at work because I was laughing so hard I disturbed coworkers.  Jerry A. finds that its very disturbing to have a horny young girl lusting after him.  He also has a strange cat.  As the book progresses it make unusual turns- and goes from very funny to very serious.  A first novel worth trying.	1997-11-24
