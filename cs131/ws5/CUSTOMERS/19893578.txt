TWO VOLUMES	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Massive, comprehensive Old Testament history	Not that I have read all that many of them, but I consider this the best history of ancient Israel ever.  Readable, factual, and enormously scholarly, It is one of those books (actually 2 of those books - it was originally a 2 volume set) I read in my college years and searched for patiently for years, trying to find an second-hand copy.  Abbot Ricciotti seems to know everything there is to know about the ancient Israelis - the archealogy, languages, history, literature, etc.  I was really happy to find out that Roman Catholic Books has reprinted this one, in a single rather massive volume for about $60.  And the reprint quality is actually quite good, unlike many reprints.	2005-07-22

Olson has done a very good job of exposing the flabby theology behind the Rapture/Left Behind craze, and the book is very readable and well written.  My only complaint is the lack of info on the books themselves - nothing really about the plot or characters of this poorly written but unbelievably popular 12 book series.   Incredibly, the Left Behind publishers wouldn't let him use quotes from the books - who says anti-Catholicism is a thing of the past?  I also have to agree with another reviewer who complained about the lack of much info about the Catholic version of the Last Days, but given that there are so many different disparate opinions, this topic is pretty much a book in itself.   Very highly recommended, and I would also recommend Michael O'Brien's Father Elijah, a much better written (and infinitely less expensive) book on the same topic.	2005-07-11

For no particular reason, others, no less important, seem to be virtually ignored.  Nimitz is one of these men, and it is fortunate that the one biography (as far as I can tell) written about him is quite excellent.  Potter writes very well, did some outstanding research, and has an enormous love for his subject, letting Nimitz's natural charm, humor, professionalism, and common sense come through on every page.   My only real complaint is that the author's near worship of his subject precludes any real discussion of the admiral's strategy, decisions, and mistakes.  Some nice maps, footnotes, an excellent bibliography. Definitely one of those books worth purchasing and reading over and over.	2005-06-23

It is a nicely written denial of all those assertations that pop up in various articles and books that the Allies, particularly England and the US, could have done much more to save the Jews than they did.  Dr Rubinstein demolishes these arguments one by one in a systematic and historically fair manner.  Other reviewers have outlined these \\"what-ifs\\" pretty well so I won't bother to. <br /> <br />I have two minor gripes with the book.  The first is that it is too short.  If Goldhagen could write some 500 pages on his ridiculous theory that the German people themselves, not Hitler and his Nazis, killed the Jews, than Rubinstein could have spent more than 216 pages (plus a ton of endnotes) on refuting them. My second complaint is that he seems to have minimized the role of Pope Pius XII and the Catholic Church in saving hundreds of thousands of Jews.  He only calls the Vatican's role \\"controversial and much debated\\" - he should have done his homework a little better on this topic. <br /> <br />Otherwise, this is a well written and well reasoned book - very highly recommended.	2005-05-06

The way which sometimes works is to play straight man and let the funny people be funny.  The way which always fails is to try to be funnier than the material.

The four step translation process - Greek, literal translation, a more polished translation, then King James - really helped me get to the nuts & bolts of the Greek Bible while I am learning Greek at my own (slow) pace.  My only complaints are that the pages are too thin and the word study at the end of the book is too short.  I really have no opinion on the \\"my Bible can beat up your Bible\\" debate other than that it is rather silly in that the differences between Greek versions are for the most part trivial.  The real differences are in the translations, explanations, and glosses.	2005-05-02

Michael Rose explains why using professional architectural terms and concepts, but this is his main thesis, and it is pretty hard to disagree with it, unless you personally like bitt-ugly churches stripped of most references to Catholicism or even Christainity,    I have two little problems with the book.  The first is that it is too short.  For one thing the book does not explain with enough detail the different trends in butt-ugly churches starting with the first 1950's era experiments through the current aberrations.      The second is that Rose does not explain how different parishes react to new churches.  One of the two churches in Chicago that offers the Latin Tridentine Mass (complete with incense, Gregorian chant, Latin speaking altar boys, and an antique but fiesty priest) is St Thomas More, a hideous 1960ish monstrosity on the southwest side - oval shape, lots of writing on walls, puke green paint, etc.  Most Polish and Hispanic parishes have very orthodox, conservative services, even if they are sometimes in newer and rather ugly modern or renovated churches. I have also seen the opposite - beautiful old churches with unorthodox services.      On the whole I really liked this book, only wishing it was a bit more in depth.  BTW if you liked this book I would also recommend another book, \\"Where Have You Gone, Michelangelo\\" by Timothy Day.	2005-04-16

This is literally an indespensible book for anybody interested in Chicago history, because for once a book more or less ignores politicians, big business, and downtown and concentrates on neighborhoods, churches, and \\"the little people\\" without being pedantic, condescending, or Marxist.  Each chapter covers one of the 15 neighborboods, and includes a narrative and a brief tour description.

It certainly is exhaustive - the research is incredible, and it is very well written.  The author has dug up dozens of Army officers, mostly mid level careerists, who held anti-Jewish views.  What Bendersky has failed to do was explain how a handful of anti-Semetic officers influenced American policy or changed the course of WWII.	2005-01-24

As far as I can tell, the research is impeccable - quite a few photos never seen before.  A real labor of live.

Anyway, this Illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy, in my opinion, is his best work.  Why? Because of the range - from hell to heaven and everywhere in between. His imagination perfectly captures Dante's even greater imagination, and as the book progresses from Inferno to Purgaturio to Paradisio you get the impression of floating into the heavens.  The translations, from Longfellow, are a little dated, but they work.	2004-12-20

I can say that, having read HG Wells' Outline of History, it is thoroughly out of date, almost ridiculously so, while this book, equally old, is just as new in terms of ideas as the day it was published.  Chesterton is simply the most amazing writer in terms of his originality that I have ever read.  No wonder it has been so influentual over the years.  Chesterton is extremely enjoyable to read just for the sake of reading.  I remember having to read Chesterton in high school (St Francis of Assisi, I believe) and hating it, mostly because it was assigned work and not pleasure.  If you read Chesterton, you have to enjoy great writing, as well as his great ideas and rather unique way of viewing reality.	2004-11-18

Even so it is very thorough and complete.  Frank Sheed would have been proud.  Keating gives a pretty comprehensive synopsis of most of the problems conservative Protestants have with Catholicism, including \\"Mary worship\\", \\"idolatry of the Mass\\", \\"un-Biblical doctrines\\", etc.  Included are plenty of suggestions on how to talk to a Fundamentalist, what to read, and so on.  Very useful.      What it is not is an explaination of that Fundamentalism is, how it operates, and why it attracts so many Catholics in the first place.  While the book is quite good on explaining the problems Fundamentalists have with Catholicism, it has little to nothing to say about similarities and points of agreement, aside from a common anti-abortion stance.      All in all, a fine book, well written, knowledgable, and highly recommended.  It is one of those books which I have read and re-read, until it is almost falling apart.	2004-11-13

It's hard to even recall how many names wander about this book.  There are so many of them - Chesterton & Belloc, of course, but also Waugh, C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, Ronald Knox, Roy Campbell, Graham Greene, Dorothy Parker and many others wander in and out of the narrative.  His writing style is very rapid - some chapters are only a few pages long, and the book is a very quick read.  More an introduction than in-depth biographies, the author aims at breath rather then depth. As he has written many other biographies on the same subjects and includes many footnoted sources, if you want more info you can easily find it.  One complaint is a total lack of goodies aside from the footnotes mentioned above -no forward or intro, no conclusion, no photos, and, what really would have been helpful, no list of works these authors wrote.        The star of the book, if he can be called such, is Chesterton.  Through his personality, writing, and wit, he seems to have drawn more converts to the Catholic Church than all of the others combined.  Ironically enough, Chesterton did not convert until 1922, only 14 years before his death and long after many were persuaded to join through his writings.  His writings pop up over and over, long after his death, and I suspect he will continue to draw in converts far into the future - the author himself converted because of reading Chesterton.	2004-11-11

It really is worth reading if you can find a copy.  The book is basically a historical summary of the Old Testament written from an orthodox Catholic standpoint.  While some of his historical (not theological) ideas are a little outdated, the book still is worth reading because of its easy style and knowledgeable yet interesting approach to the Old Testament, which, to say the least, can be a little confusing.  While this book is not quite in the league of Ricciotti's magnificent 2 volume History of Israel or Bright's one volume book with the same name, it is much more accessible, readable, and fun.  Not many extras - few footnotes, 8 OK maps, a nice chronology, no bibliography - like most Daniel-Rops books in translation.	2004-11-10

While some volumes are a little better than others - if I remember correctly, the first three volumes (this is #2) were the best - they are all extremely readable and informative.  His writing style is simply something to behold, even in translation.  It is much more lucid, expressive, and emotional than English writers - a real lesson in writing beautifully, even when writing something \\"dry\\" like history, especially ecclesiastical history, which can be as dry as dust.  Daniel-Rops is a very Catholic (not as partisan as Warren Carroll, though) without a trace of modern historical \\"objectivity\\" so if you hold a grudge against the Roman Catholic church you will either be offended or enlightened by reading him.  Not much of a bibliography, at least in the English version, no illustrations, a few maps.      This particular volume covers approximately the time from St. Augustine to the turn of the millenium, about 600 years total.  It ranges over an enormous amount of material, from the crumbling Roman Empire to barbarian invasions to missionary activities to the problems with the Byzantine Empire.  Bad popes are not neglected, but, unlike many more recent histories, the good ones are not either.  Individual saints, like St Augustine and St Gregory, to name the biggies, play a large part in the narrative, which is written smoothly and reads almost like a novel.  Any way you look at it, this is a great book from a really great series, which really deserves to be in print.	2004-11-10

While she summarizes the struggles between liberals and conservatives in the US and Canadian Church very well the best parts, in my opinion, are when she writes about her personal experiences as a lonely faithful fighting against a relentless liberal bureaucracy bent on imposing its will despite what Vatican II actually wrote, what the pope has to say on the subject, or what individual lay people think.  I have read it over and over - it's that good - and recommend this book to anybody interested in the subject.  It was written in 1986 and updated a few years later, so by now it is a little obsolete.	2004-10-26

It is simply the most in-depth, informative, and readable attack on the vernacular Mass I have ever seen.  Davies literally goes through the liturgy line by line, comparing it to the Latin Mass, showing just how bad, inept, and sometimes wrong the English translation is compared to the original Latin and how the new Mass deliberately minimized the particularly \\"Catholic\\" aspects while introducing Protestant practices.  His basic conclusion is that the new Mass is perfectly valid and legitimate, just not very good, a point I rather agree with. If I remember correctly, he also gave examples of Masses gone horribly wrong, and how the old Tridentine rite was designed to prevent such silliness.  If you can find this book buy it, or at least read it - it's extremely informative and well written.    One word about Michael Davies.  He was (and perhaps still is) a follower of Archbishop Marcel LeFebvre's Society of Pius X.  While I have little sympathy with sedevacantists or schismatics, no matter what their cause, he is still a hell of a good writer and his writings are worth reading, but keep in mind where he is coming from.	2004-10-04

It's not quite up to his other work.  His writing style is a bit harder to follow and his points are more scattered.  Sometimes he sounds like a union organizer for an organist guild.

Sometimes stunningly bad.  Day's book just reaffirms from a professional standpoint pretty much what I already knew, that contemporary Catholic music is a mish-mash of bad old Protestant hymns and bad new Catholic hymns - that nobody really sings well or too enthusiastically because there is no real beauty in them. <br /> <br />What I didn't know was how bad the music was before Vatican II, and the influence the Irish culture had on stifling musical development in this country.  Interesting theory. <br /> <br />Day's solution - bring back some trace of professionalism - seems to make sense.  I recently moved into a parish with a top-notch music program from one with terrible music and mediocre attendance.  On Sundays when the whole choir is present and singing classics like Palestrina and de Lassus attentance is packed while on other Sundays it is at best respectable. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book.

It is mostly concerned with overall strategy and campaigns; less with individual battles and operations.  The book severely criticizes the Johnson Administration (with a particular venom for Robert McNamara) but is much more positive about Nixon.  The author's attitude towards the South Vietnamese government and Army is critical but quite fair, and he gives the North Vietnamese their due.  This is not really a book about American military performance, and does not really mention problems within the military, such as drug abuse, racial incidents, massacres, etc., but he does believe that any problems were a result of having a bankrupt political/military strategy.

Stanton is not really concerned with politics of strategy, only the performance of the Army and Marines in combat in Vietnam and, more unusually, how the Regular Army reacted to the war. Densely written and without enough maps, it certainly is a bit difficult to read, but it is worth it.

I first read in college a few years back and it changed everything I thought I knew about the New Testament.  His scholarship is simply amazing and his faith is evident on every page, but the most amazing thing about this book is that it is so down-to-earth and readable.  He doesn't use obtuse theological terms or cloud his thoughts in philosophical hair-splitting, but writes clearly, simply, and logically.  The chapter entitled \\"Rationalist Interpretations of the Life of Christ\\" is the best debunking of modern New Testament scholarship I have ever read and is worth reading on its own.  His explanations of the differences between the four Gospel accounts is both illuminating and intelligent, and his defense of their authenticity makes far more sense than any of the complicated theories I wasted so much time learning in Catholic high school and college. I highly recommend this book or any others by the the same author. By the way, it IS available new from Roman Catholic Books.	2004-04-09

She has an excellent grasp of the subject, a wonderful imagination, and was a real joy to read.  However, it has many flaws.  The biggest is the complete lack of goodies - no citations, no maps, no illustrations whatsoever.  She also didn't even reprint in full the few sources available, i.e. the Gospels, Josephus, &amp; Philo of Alexandrea.  On the other hand, Wroe has an obsession with medieval passion plays, which aren't really relevant to the subject.  The history of Judea under the procurators is mentioned often but not really discussed in detail.  She has little respect for the Gospels, or for Christianity in general, but this is normal and acceptable by today's standards.  This is a good but not great book, and is worth reading, but I was dissappointed. It's more a long 400 page essay than a true biography or history.	2004-04-01
