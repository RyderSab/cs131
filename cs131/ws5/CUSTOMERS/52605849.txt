Through this book Amy Chua has taught me so much about the failure of free market and democracy in much of the Third World.  This is an excellent book that adds to, rather than contradicts, the conventional U.S. theory about exporting our system to the rest of the world.<br />I would point out a couple of shortcomings of the book for other readers.<br />(1) The cultural, political and economic legacy (not to mention the brutality) of European colonialism is inadequately analyzed.  The fact that the Chinese and Lebanese have become so successful in many parts of the world owes a great deal to the historical circumstance in which these immigrant minorities collaborated with and profited from the oppressive colonial regimes.<br />(2) The comparison between Jewish people and the overseas Chinese is rather superficial.  In addition to the collaborationist colonial role they played, the Chinese differ from the Jews in that the former, perhaps out of their sense of culutral/racial superiority, refuse to regard their \\"indigenous\\" countrymen as equal.  Only when assimilated successfully by the indigenous government, the Chinese seem to accept the fact that they are a part of their adopted country.	2003-02-10

There is no question that far too many civilians were killed in the Sino-Japanese battle in Nanking and that this tragedy marked a dark chapter in Japan's military history.<br />There is also strong evidence to suggest that Ms. Chang's documentation of the incident in Nanking is deeply flawed.  Not to mention the unsubstantiated death toll of 300,000 (today's international consensus is ~20,000), the book relies heavily on anonymous &quot;eyewitnesses&quot;, mislabeled photos from Chinese wartime propaganda and the now-discredited Japanese newspaper articles (on the &quot;beheading contest&quot;, which was concocted entirely by circulation-seeking Japanese journalists at the time and never took place in reality).<br />That the book is of questionable quality is one thing.  That it carries possible political motivation is quite another - and deeply disturbing.  Ms. Chang's sources are skewed heavily towards mainland Chinese &quot;scholars&quot;, and her accusations (most notoriously the Nanking casualties of 300,000) are today closely echoed by Beijing's authoritarian regime and its nationalist supporters.  It is well-known that Beijing never hesitates to exploit this Nanking card to its political advantage.<br />All in all the book casts light on an important incident that took place during the Pacific War but should be treated with extreme caution.	2001-06-18

However the discourse must be kept focused on the merits of the argument.  Pointing an accusatory finger at other reviewers based on their supposed ethnicity (Chinese claiming Japanese bias and vice versa) is thoroughly counter-productive.<br />One surprise to note is some reviewers' claim that the number of civilian casualties (put at 300,000 by Chang, in the tens of thousands by most scholars) does not matter.  Yes, a tragedy is a tragedy, and a civilian toll of, say, 10,000 would not excuse the Japanese military for what it did.  However numbers like this do matter in the context of inflammatory (and false) claims such as &quot;forgotten Holocaust&quot; and attempts to trivialize atomic incineration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in comparison.	2001-06-18

Far too many people were killed so  unnecessarily.<br />It is equally absurd to jump on this Japan-bashing orgy  that Iris Chang's book has created.<br />First her book is not a history book:  It is a book based on, among other things, second-hand &quot;witness&quot;  accounts and war-time propaganada photos.<br />More importantly, however, most  serious (i.e. fact-based) historians outside Japan believe the casualities  were probably in the tens of thousands.  Still too many, but this was  definitely not a &quot;holocaust&quot;.<br />Some of the references to the  atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - and how &quot;necessary&quot;  they were - in reviews presented here are plain sickening.  All indications  were that, by August 1945, the war was over.  Japan was no longer capable  of fighting.  At any rate specifically targeting and incinerating 200K+  civilians with A-bombs to achieve a war aim cannot possible be accetable.

Also there is little doubt that, as in many similar conflicts, many civilians were unnecessarily killed. To say that no civilian lives were lost would obviously be absurd.  However to portray  the Nanking battle as a &quot;holocaust&quot; is merely to play into the  hands of communist Chinese propagandists.  The civilian death toll in  Nanking was initially put at 140,000 during the military tribunal in Tokyo  shortly after WWII.  Today serious scholars inside and outside Japan reckon  that they have managed to piece together what really happened.  The battle,  they think, probably involved 40,000-60,000 deaths. What makes the  Chinese claim that up to 300,000 civilians were slaughtered by Japanese  troops particularly distasteful is not only the sheer magnitude of the  overestimation but also the cynical calculus behind it.  The Chinese  leadership in Beijing wants to ensure that the Nanking tragedy was of  greater historical significance than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and  Nagasaki, in which approximately 210,000 civilians were instantaneously  incinerated.  Hence the fictional 300,000 figure. That a communist  propaganda book like Chang's \\"Rape of Nanking\\" has passed without  much scrutiny in this country is a tribute to the openness and tolerance of  our society.  It is also a frightening reflection of our own historical  ignorance.	2000-02-13

This sort of fantasy has humiliated Asian women inside and outside the US for many years and must be condemned.<br />However it should be said that the book does an important service to the Western public by portraying geisha for what they are; treasured artists charged with carrying on the centuries-old tradition of ancient dance and music.  This is refreshing given that most Western men fantasize about geisha as mere prostitutes	1999-01-21

It is time for us to wake up again and think seriously about our national security and interest in East  Asia.<br />Beijing has shown time and time again that it is capable of unusual  brutality and oppression throughout the region - ranging from its  occupation of Tibet and sponsorship of genocide in Cambodia to the invasion  of Vietnam and backing of North Korea.  It continues to threaten Taiwan's  democratic government.  Most worringly to us, China has ICBMs, capped with  nuclear warheads, targeted at major US cities.  (These have been recently  &quot;detargeted&quot;; but they can be retargeted in a matter of  minutes.)<br />Moreover Beijing has developed a very sophisticated global  propaganda machine that has done much to manipulate the Western public  opinion in China's favor.<br />A thoughtful book like this one has been long  overdue.	1999-01-18

It is also important to place and understand them in a wider context of the time.<br />Japan was fighting one of the bloodiest wars in modern history  against Western colonial powers in East Asia.  She was trying to defend her  interest in the region that had been so brutally conquered by the West.   She was trying to liberate the region from many years of colonialism.  She  was also trying to replace the West as a new colonial master ...<br />There is  little doubt that many civilian lives were lost throughout East Asia.   However to view Japan's action as an &quot;atrocity&quot; and/or a  &quot;war crime&quot; is one-sided and misleading.<br />It is true there could  be a more open discussion of the war in Japan.  However again we must  remember that the US itself is only slowing coming to terms with its  shameful past such as the genocide of Native Americans and the  Africa-America slave trade.	1999-01-18
