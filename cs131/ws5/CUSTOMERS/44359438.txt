The good news is that anyone can have their book published.  The bad news is that ANYone can have their book published!<br /><br />I bought this book sight-unseen, based on its summary at Amazon.  The story sounded promising:  A gay couple, Scott and Vallie, decide to adopt a gay teenager, Nicholas, who previously lived in a deeply homophobic foster home.  While making the transition to responsible parents, they also try to instill in Nicholas a sorely-lacking sense of self-worth, and assure him that they will not \\"give up\\" on him, as everyone else has before in his life.  With help from wisecracking gay Uncle Ben, who lives with them, they help Nicholas through the move to their rural home, coping with a new school complete with a fag-baiting bully.  Sounded like a good start to what could be an interesting story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author (who has one previous title to his credit, also self-published) doesn't develop the story beyond the brief summary I just gave you.  What is much worse is that the author's writing style is borderline awful, telling the entire story in a predictable manner, using unrealistic dialogue that seems to alternate between condescending detail and singsong-ish \\"See Spot Jump\\" meter.  For example, when a giraffe is seen on a trip to the zoo, one character alerts the others to \\"look at his elongated neck!\\" (Do YOU know anyone who talks like that?)  If Uncle Ben walks into the room, and there are five other characters already there, you can bet the ranch that the next five lines will read, verbatim, \\"'Hi, Uncle Ben!' said (name of character).\\"  If there is an annoucement that pizza is for dinner, it will be followed by virtually identical separate comments by each person that they love pizza.<br /><br />I thought perhaps the book was meant for younger readers, although there was no indication anywhere that this was the case.  While not sexually explicit, the subject matter isn't really appropriate for anyone below junior high or high school age, and they deserve better than the eye-rolling dialogue delivered.  It's a shame, since the book's subject is a rather original and timely idea, which could have been better developed by an author with even marginal storytelling skill.

This was likely the first \\"series\\" of gay novels I became hooked on, so I welcomed this overdue finale' to the stories. Like the books before it, \\"How's Your Romance?\\" really doesn't have a specific story line or plot you can explain. The best analogy I can give, for the entire series, is that the books read kind of like a gay \\"Seinfeld\\", the infamous \\"show about nothing,\\" where the stories were really just incidents in the lives of the colorful ensemble characters. In this case, those characters include Bud (the author's alterego, a middle-aged author/musician who is kind of the father/confessor everyone goes to for pearls of wisdom), his enterprising and kind of \\"way out there\\" live-in lover/boytoy Cosgrove, Bud's long time best friend Dennis Savage (who lives upstairs), and young golddigger \\"J\\" (previously known as \\"Little Kiwi\\" in earlier novels, and Dennis Savage's ex, now out on his own.) The \\"circle\\" of friends in expanded, in this case, with Bud's gay early-20's cousin Ken, who hangs out with a group of similar shallow Chelsea-Boy gym bunnies (referred to by Bud as \\"the Kens\\", as in the 60's era dolls), and a few others.<br /><br />In this finale', Mordden explores issues such as metrosexuality (Both J and Ken are dating seemingly clueless \\"straight\\" guys reeking of homoerotic subtext), loyalty (\\"the Kens\\" try a sign-up sheet to avoid conflict when someone spots a new hot guy at the gym, etc.), self-respect (Bud's friend Peter is in an abusive relationship with a demi-God), and gay marriage (\\"the Kens\\" have a discussion with Bud present).<br /><br />It was amusing and enjoyable for me to \\"visit\\" with old friends again, after being acquainted with most of them for twenty years (though others who followed the series in real-time can't help but notice that they aged a lot slower than we did!), but I think the book, of itself, might seem too disjointed and confusing for those not already familiar with at least a couple of the early works. Like \\"Seinfeld\\", it is a bit of an acquired taste, and not for everyone. I'd give it four stars (out of five) for the effort.h others who followed the series in real-time can't help but notice that they aged a lot slower than we did!), but I think the book, of itself, might seem too disjointed and confusing for those not already familiar with at least a couple of the early works.

At times in my life, when I faced dilemmas that seemed beyond my capacity to decide, I have illogically actually looked for wisdom in those tacky, gramatically-challenged sayings one finds in fortune cookies at a Chinese restaurant!  That's why the title of this book was especially attractive to me.<br /><br />Phillip Powell is another gay man in a similar situation.  Having decided not to attend college, he was 18 when he had left his gulf-coast  Mississippi home town and family behind, as well as his deadend job in a local bookstore, to create a new life for himself as an artist in New York City.  Now, five years later, he had an apartment in Hells Kitchen he could not afford, cluttered with canvases of paintings he never completed, while he worked another dead end job at the local Barnes & Noble.  Having dinner at a Chinese restaurant with his current lover, and the poser who was obviously going to steal him away, Phillip is surprised when his fortune cookie contains three fortunes:  \\"Your secret desire to completely change your life will manifest.\\" \\"You may be hungry soon. Order a takeout now.\\" \\"You must know there is a path at the end of the road.\\"<br /><br />The first fortune seems to come true almost immediately, when his estranged, rich grandfather shows up unexpectedly in Manhattan, to convince/bribe Phillip to return home to care, temporarily, for his mother, who is at best eccentric or - as generally regarded - rather crazy.  Leaving Manhattan means saying leaving the \\"surrogate\\" family he has created there, including a new Irish boyfriend, Kieran, whom he met the day his grandfather arrived in town.  And leaving means having to put up, again, with his mother's four controlling sisters, who are anything but welcoming when Phillip returns home.  In the weeks and months that follow, he reconnects with his high school best friend/crush, gets pursued by an aggressive Southern gal sent by his bible-thumping Aunt to \\"save\\" him from sin, decides to share a house with a mysterious young woman and her lesbian roommates, explores small town Mississipi \\"gay nightlife\\" at a private pool party, finds his painting muse may be the old historic properties in his hometown, all while daintily trying to work his way back into his mother's life without \\"setting her off\\" on a tirade.<br /><br />A marvelous, touching story about family, both the family we are born into and the \\"family\\" we create out of the good friends with whom we surround ourselves, and how they affect us and shape who we ultimately become, even after we seem to have moved on from them.

David is a 28 year old Brit with a good job, living in the house of his parents while they travel for his father's business.  Commuting home one day, he misses his train and meets Rob, who says he is 19 and a runaway.  David is fascinated by the young man in many ways, and, very unlike his normally careful nature, offers to let him stay in the guest room in his parents home for the night.  Rob guesses correctly that David is gay, but David assures him that the offer has no strings attached.  Rob accompanies David home, but nervously eyes the locked bedroom door all night.<br /><br />Despite the rocky beginning, Rob continues to live with David for more than a year, and they become friends.  David tries not to pry into why Rob never talks about why he left home, and is puzzled by some of Rob's quirks, such as being very emphatic about not having his photo taken.  But the bigger problem is that David has become very fond of Rob, to the point where he is in love with him and has cut his other friends out of his life, fearing they would criticize David for foolishly lusting after someone he could not ever have. What he does not realize is that Rob has sensed David's feelings for him, although they never discussed the situation. When David's parents come home for an extended stay, Rob moves out, they make a clean break and don't see each other, while David tries to put his life back together, but finds the hurt is just as great in losing a love that was never reciprocated.<br /><br />A very sweet, simple love story, with realistic but complex  characters, parents that know of their adult child's sexuality and accept it, as well as supportive friends and co-workers.  The novel especially has relevance for those who have dealt with unrequitted love, or who have been in a mentoring role with a younger man.  While some British slang leaves his American scratching his head, I had no such problems dealing with Mandel's verbiage, and the story could have very easily have happened in the states.

Sheraton and Jeremy are gay lovers taking an unusual vacation in a rural Pennsylvania town, spending some time at a private boy's school to catch up with Sheraton's boyhood friend Barry, who teaches at the school.  Shortly after arriving, they hear about the unexpected death of one student, then they get ambushed and knocked out by a mysterious cult of men/boys wearing hooded robes and chanting.  Much to Jeremy's chagrin, this encourages Sheraton's latent propensity to get involved in unsolved mysteries, and they are soon comparing notes with Barry and a fellow faculty member, the wisecracking Rick, about the strange goings-on at the school, which are kept as quiet as possible by the schooo's dean.  With a student body that seems to be in a trance, the dean's assistant/school cook who looks and acts like the Bride of Dracula, and a visit by Barry's ex who has surprisingly turned into a religious fanatic, Sheraton and Jeremy find themselves drawn into a situation that can be dangerous on several levels.<br /><br />I did not read author Albanese's prior book in the series, \\"Mystery Without Any Clues\\", as I had been advised to start with this one, which was reviewed as a better read.  It's a good mystery with many unpredictable twists, not quite as dark and \\"gothic\\" as the summary may sound (which I consider to be a plus), and the author's sense of humor is evident throughout.  Though it is generally well-written, I don't think many readers will identify with the crime-solving duo, who seem way too plastic to me.  My main criticism is that some of the plot developments were more than a tad unrealistic (Murders not really being investigated by local police, detectives from NYC popping up to help in rural PA, undercover police come and go on small closed campus without school officials knowing, etc.)  It's a pleasant diversion, but not a book I'd especially recommend.	2005-09-08

On that level I was not disappointed, though I feel Roeder has pushed his story lines more than a bit beyond believeable, with the inclusion of ghosts, angels and a town where it seems every other teenager in town turns out to be gay or bisexual.<br /><br />\\"Masked Destiny\\" tells the story primarily of two teen boys who narrate the novel.  There's Oliver, a 14 year old pudgy gay boy with self-esteem issues, and Skye, seemingly the stereotypical ego-driven 16 year old football jock, who work together at the feed store in small town Verona, Indiana.  Skye lives with his sister and small nephew, as his parents have separated and moved elsewhere, and is obsessed with working out, competiting, and remaining one of the primary \\"Alpha males\\" at the high school.  Skye figures that Oliver is probably gay, but doesn't bother him about it, and actually kind of gets a kick out of it when Landon, the team's manager and towel boy, \\"checks him out\\" as he comes out of the shower each day at practice.  Skye world changes after he fails to intervene when he later sees Landon being gay-bashed by two teammates who resented being stared at, then becomes a target himself when Landon ambushes Skye and Greg (one of his attackers) with a gun, shoots Greg, chastises Skye for not coming to his aid, and then takes his own life.  Witnessing another bashing after a Halloween party, still wearing his mask from the party, Skye steps in to run off the attackers, and becomes a bit of a legend at his school.  Meanwhile, Oliver finds out some disturbing information about a cute boy he meets at a gay youth group, which ties into stories about ghosts at an old mansion and the murder of some gay boys years earlier.<br /><br />I give the novel four out of five stars.

Meet Curtis Jenkins, a successful middle-aged writer in New York City, who can't seem to even get close to finding Mr. Right.  His overbearing, flamboyant mother (who claims she knew he was gay since the day he was born) and his best friend Quinn (a gay soap opera writer far more interested in finding \\"Mr. Right Now\\" instead of \\"Mr. Right\\") say that Curtis is too picky (hence the analogy to picking fruit), and push him to seek advice from the gruff, no-nonsense, ancient Dr. Magda Turnick (whom I can picture as sort of a geriatric Dr. Phil, in drag).<br /><br />Pushed by Dr. Turnick to go on at least a date a week during therapy, Curtis stops avoiding meeting men, and has some some very amusing dates.  Next to the narcoleptic con artist, it's a tie for me as to whether my favorite is the guy who invited him home for dinner (he made himself steak, but served Curtis only a plate of cheese and bread) or the guy who tried to seduce him dressed and made up as Liza Minnelli.  Also amusing his fling with a \\"younger man\\", which necessitated Curtis hiding under the bed when the 21 year old's mother comes home unexpectedly and interrupted them!  In the middle of it all, Curtis' mother comes up with a revelation and a new relationship for herself that throws Curtis for a loop.<br /><br />Extremely witty and totally amusing, especially as a satirical look at living in a big city filled with eligible gay men, yet seeming only to be able to find the losers and weirdos (Been there, done that!) I laughed out loud several times, and could relate to Curtis' final revelation that dating was most definitely NOT like picking fruit, but required a lot of effort as well as some luck.  A bit sparse at only 159 pages, and I feel the author could have easily fleshed this out more, for greater enhoyment.  But I still give it four stars out of five, and recommend it as a light read.	2005-08-28

This collection includes works by some names you may have heard before, such as author Jim Grimsley and poet Rene Arroyo, and includes short story writers ranging from career prison inmates to doctoral candidates, with the quality varying as much as the backgrounds of those who created them.<br /><br />There are stories that will amuse, some that will give an enlightening insight into being gay in a culture you might otherwise never be exposed to, a few that convey sentiments you may personally identify with, and others that may cause you to shrug with bewilderment.  (Into that last category I'd put what I'd consider to be an out-of-place scholarly-sounding \\"treatise\\" by the editor, who seeks to tie together all of the varying voices in the collection and put them in perspective with the history of the gay community over the past fifty years.)  Of course, as a collection of unrelated works, one is free to use the same method Gump used for his box of candy, sample what looks interesting and discard it if it proves to be too distasteful.	2005-08-25

After reading his first two works, I knew Steven Cooper had a rather witty, offbeat approach to mystery novels.  In his \\"With You In Spirit,\\" the mystery revolved around a dead drag queen whose messages from the afterlife were often accompanied by a chorus of \\"I Will Survive,\\" while his \\"Saving Valencia\\" was even stranger, taking the old saying \\"Think with the head on top of your neck, instead of ...\\" to an extreme.  So, in \\"Deadline,\\" I was expecting something original, clever and entertaining.  What I wasn't expecting was the fun including a murder mystery among the best I have ever read.  It not only kept me laughing and entertained throughout, but the ending revelation came as a complete surprise.<br /><br />Damon Fitzgerald is the openly gay investigative reporter at a Boston television station, who longs to free himself from writing what he considers to be commercialized \\"junk\\" journalism and instead tackle his lifelong goal of writing a great novel.  His few false starts on the latter will never pay off, since Damon managed to get himself murdered just before he was to present a career-making expose' about how a bank failure is connected with a criminal conspiracy which resulted in the death of a young female attorney.<br /><br />His dry sense of humor intact, the deceased Fistgerald serves as the narrator of the novel, mixing a chronological telling of what happened, along with various musings about what things are really like after death.  Those \\"insider\\" reports are especially original and insightful, often amusing, such as revelations that those \\"hang up\\" phone calls you get may be a deceased acquaintance messing with your head, and relating how he decided to have some fun with his best friend, acting as sort of the spirit \\"director\\" of one evening's sexual fantasy!

In the fourth (and, in my opinion, best) mystery in this series, Craft's Claire Gray again stumbles across a murder, this time of the vindictive ex-wife of her friend and employer at the Desert Arts College, billionaire D. Glen Yeats.  Circumstances implicate Yeats as the murderer, a possibility Claire finds logical but hopes her intuition is correct as deeming it unlikely.  Other possible suspects include Yeat's daughter Paige, who expressed open hostility toward her former step mother and was seen en route to see her shortly before she was found dead, as well as the decedent's own son, a spoiled playboy who had financial problems and would be the sole beneficiary of her will. As in the past, Claire teams unofficially with Larry Knohl, Palm Springs police detective and brother of her good friend Grant, in trying to sort out the facts of the case, ironically now urged on by Yeats, who discouraged his employee from becoming involved in police business ... that is until it was his rich behind that was on the line!<br /><br />This installment in the series also fleshes out several of the supporting characters, including Claire's oldest friend Kiki (who also is Glenn update his wardrobe), Grant and his younger boyfriend Kane (who are planning a civil union ceremony), Thad Quatrain (theatre student of Claire's, who is the nephew of Mark Manning, the star of Craft's just-concluded other series of mystery novels), and Detective Knohl, who is going through some marital problems.  The pace and suspense of the mystery is Hitchcock-ish, not surprising when Claire and other characters draw parallels between the murder and the play \\"Rebecca\\", which Hitchcock filmed and which her students are currently studying in their summer workshop.

Some explicit sexual content, but am told it is less so than in his first memoir, \\"Wild Animals I Have Known\\", which dealt mostly with the San Francisco gay sexual scene of the 1970's and shortly thereafter. Readers of that book may enjoy this sequel to get a better perspective on the author's reactions to that \\"kid in a candy store\\"-time in his life.<br /><br />Bentley is both witty and poignant in his memoirs, with an overall effect the same as if you were sitting around with a friend talking about episodes in your past life.  He honestly discusses his HIV status (positive, but blessed with a genetic abnormality that keeps him asymptomatic), having buried two lovers lost to AIDS, and gives an interesting perspective on his mixed feelings of guilt and joy at having been spared.  One chapter talks about an old lesbian couple that he and his lover befriended, the relationship having ended when the survivor of that couple shunned Kevin's partner when it was revealed he was HIV+.  There are tongue-in-cheek recollections of a couple of visits to Santa Fe to get a mission church's \\"holy dirt\\" (reputed to be health-restoring, but revealed to have been carted in from somewhere else), an AIDS hospice worker with a reputation as a  \\"widow chaser\\" (tries to hook up with his patients' partners), battles with monogamy, fond recollections of his (many) trips to a now defunct San Francisco VD clinic known as \\"My Clementia\\", stories of his college years spent mostly stoned and lusting over \\"straight\\" classmates, and - something many of us can relate to - stories of dealing with his boyfriends' crazy families.

Claire is a twice-divorced rather sardonic osteopathic physician with a daughter in college, a dog named \\"Dog\\", estranged from her own mother, and with a seeming knack of atracting lunatics as potential suitors.

The story covers how each met and grew to became a part of their mutual support system, and establishes how each person's strengths are used to help the group and each other.  For example, Freddy is kind of the peacemaker when something goes wrong, Claire cooks great dinners and has a gift for putting everyone's (except her own) life in perspective, Joshua is the business brain, and Richie is their conscience that keeps them from binging on junk food.

When the father died, neither shed a tear.  While Nathan stayed close to home after college, moving into the cottage his father had owned and living as he had, while working as a high school teacher, Tommy fled to New York City, where he had a changing cast of \\"steady\\" lovers.  The brothers reunite several summers later, when Tommy comes to visit Nathan, bringing along his current boytoy and two friends, a married couple having some problems (the husband is starting to realize his gay leanings, and the wife is beating herself up about not seeing the signs earlier.)  One of Nathan's new summer school students, 15 year old Simon, is a frequent guest at the cottage, and Nathan gets understandably nervous when he sees the way Tommy looks at the teen, who confessed that he thinks he is gay.<br /><br />\\"The Brothers Bishop\\" is a complex, emotionally-rich and powerful look at the possible impact a dysfunctional childhood could have on the two brothers.  The book includes a great cast of supporting characters, some of whom point out that Nathan often seems to have his father's judgemental temper, which makes him look inward and try to be more accepting of what life brings.  What it does bring that fateful summer is a series of confrontations and revelations that ultimately destroy several relationships and several lives.

He has good looks, a gym-toned body to die for, good friends (including a \\"fag hag\\" girlfriend Chessie who adores him), and a financial success in his dream job, being owner-chef of three successful restaurants in Boston.  Last but not least, he has handsome and hunky Troy Boston, cream of the crop of that town's \\"A-list\\" gays, as his boyfriend.  Or does he?<br /><br />While Troy and Brad spend a good deal of their free time together, seem to get along fabulously both in and out of bed, and are even working on a joint project (\\"Club Troy\\", a unique nightspot with a restaurant to be handled by Brad), Brad is still somewhat insecure about his dream relationship with Troy, who remains somewhat emotionally distant.  Then there's Caroline, Troy's socialite mother. who clearly doesn't regard Brad as good enough for her son, and isn't shy about letting him know it.  Add into this mix Aria Shakespeare, an upper-class blonde twink gym bunny Caroline adores and who clearly has an interest in Troy, and Brad's uneasiness is at its peak.  Can he trust Troy and be able to count on a future with him?<br /><br />The authors of \\"Hot Sauce\\" and other \\"Romentics\\" novels set out to make a series of pure romance novels, sort of a gay version of the Harlequin bodice-rippers targeting straight women.  In that context, they have succeeded, providing readers don't expect more.  There are a lot of sexy and romantic settings, characters you can only dream of being close to, and a predictable plot with little substance.  To be fair, the characters are better developed than in their earlier attempts, and the proofreading deficiency of those earlier (self-published) titles are no longer apparent in this first novel published by Warner Books.  A pleasant diversion for those looking for an extremely light read.	2005-06-26

In this eighth book in the \\"Paul Turner\\" series, we join that Chicago police detective widower at home as his family (consisting of 16 year old son Brian, his 11 year old brother Jeff, who used a wheelchair due to spina bifida, and Paul's lover Ben, who owned a garage) prepared to attend a science fiction writers and media convention.  Costumes were the rule at such affairs, with Jeff having worked on his own alien costume for weeks, while Brian went as the Beastmaster, complete with leather loincloth and jewel studded broadsword.<br /><br />The next time that Turner saw a similar broadsword, it was sticking out of a popular but controversial science fiction writer who had been murdered in her room.  Nearby was a red ostrich feather, that writer's trademark-like reference in her books, broken in half.  That scenario would replay itself several times during the next 24 hrs, as Turner and his police partner, Buck Fenwick, found additional victims, most attendees at the convention, but including one police officer on the scene.  Amid over a thousand eccentric convention attendees, most in costumes, Turner and Fenwick learn of the behind-the-scenes cliques and posturing that caused friction between many of them, and try to gauge if the arguments could have led to murder.  An additional concern for Turner is the fact that Jeff's broadsword comes up missing, and might have been used in one of the murders, but this is soon overshadowed by a suspicion that his own children may be targeted by the elusive killer.<br /><br />Another first-rate mystery from Zubro, one that should be especially interesting to anyone who ever attended a sci fi or Star Trek convention, since he seems to capture the different types of personalities one would find at such a gathering.  Plot and characters were excellent, and kept me guessing till the end.	2005-06-13

But when their father met Rick, who now lives with them, they found the perfect \\"second Dad\\", one who seemed to love both of them as much as he did Jack.  Rick's occupation in real estate also allowed him a much more flexible schedule than his partner, so the boys thrived on the extra attention they both got as a result.<br /><br />But all is not well.  Jack has a very controlling personality, insisting on micromanaging every aspect of their home life.  Rick understands that the boys are really his responsibility, but he resents the fact that Jack won't let him make even the simplest judgement call in dealing with them, without causing an argument over how they are \\"my kids, not yours\\" which actually escallated into Jack becoming physically abusive, to Rick and the boys.  Rick was not so much afraid of Jack as he was afraid of the trauma that this could cause the boys, who looked up to both of them, and spent all of his time nervously trying not to upset Jack in any way.<br /><br />I thought the two topics -  second parent caregiving as well as domestic abuse - were important ones that should be addressed more often, and looked forward to reading this book.  I was disappointed on several levels, in that the book only superficially dealt with the topics, providing instead a rather amateurish narration of some selected days in the household, only briefly hinting (in flashbacks) at some of the factors which could have triggered Jack's propensity to be abusive.  The book is also rather short, just 187 pages, double spaced, set in what looks like large 11-point type; in a more usual novel format, it likely would have been less than 100 pages.  There are also a fair number of typos, far from the worst I have seen, but mentioned only because of the author's claim that he is a perfectionist that went through seven re-edits of the manuscript.  It's a self-published (I assume) first work, so perhaps I am being too harsh.  Hopefully, he will take the time in the future to draw out the characters a bit better, pace the novel to cover the subject more adequately, and give it less of a \\"Jack said this, Rich answered that\\" repetitive singsong-like tone.ts of the manuscript.

A city of ethnic diversity, where his red Afro would be less likely to elicit stares, and where a significant portion of the population was also gay, and far enough away from his father whom Paul felt was disappointed in him.  If he could just make it through the sky-high rents, having to rent a room from a woman who constantly suspected him of stealing from her, and if he could only find a great boyfriend, like Twitch, the fellow he met on the basketball courts one night shortly after his arrival, and whom he has been \\"courting\\" ever since.<br /><br />First time novelist Bill Eisele comes a coming-of-age novel about a gay man learning to be true to himself, rather than base his happiness on others' connections to him or their expectations.  The diverse, colorful characters are mostly all members of a pick-up basketball team in a league at a local community center, where Paul seems to mistake their success on court with their ability to succeed at life.  When his parents and younger sister come to visit him in San Francisco, Paul is worried about being caught in a lie he told about having a steady boyfriend, but finally allows himself to see his father through his friends' eyes, resulting in a cathartic  reconciliation of sorts.  Those who are not avid basketball fans (neither am I) should not be deterred by the novel's seeming preoccupation with the sport, since the \\"game\\" turns out to be much more than the one played under a hoop and net.  Give it a try.	2005-05-31

He takes his prescribed HIV-related medications faithfully, even though he knows there is an even chance that he is the placebo group and these are nothing but sugar pills.  He has his good days and bad days, friends who help him get through the latter, and has simplified his life and divested himself of all unnecessary possessions, to make it easier for his executor when he is gone.  He has also accumulated a bunch of pills to hasten his demise, in the event \\"things get icky\\" at the end.<br /><br />Then a letter comes from Bill Weiss, an eccentric but brilliant avante-garde director, who insists that Gerald come out of retirement and join a company he is putting together to stage a play in Sicily.  Having been a founding member of Weiss' theatre company, where he had some of his best (and worst) experiences in the theatre, Gerald decides to be a bit foolhardy, perhaps for the last time in his life, and agrees to go.  A week later, he is sharing a third-rate hotel room with two other actors in Bellina, Sicily, and meets the dozen or so other actors, including a group of difficult and often crude Italian thespians, causing him to second guessing the wisdom of his actions.  But when the demanding, tyranical William Weiss (Gerald is the only one to know him well enough to call him Bill, but is still somewhat struck mute by his commanding presence and eccentric brilliance) makes his appearance and begins to sketch out the complicated and illogical staging of the play, Gerald feels more alive than he has been in more than a decade, and even discontinues his medications to avoid the side effects that could detract from his performance.  In the busy and often frustrating weeks to come, Gerald finds amusement, friendship, betrayal, exhaustion and the promise of a possible romance.<br /><br />The novel is kind of a gay, Italian version of the film \\"Breakfast Club\\", where you meet and get to know a group of diverse and colorful characters based solely on their interaction with each other.  Author McDermott obviously is an observer of people, especially his fellow actors, and the basic \\"show must go on\\" attitude that makes actors put up with far more than mere mortals would endure for the small amount of compensation and minimal recognition of their craft.  Erotic in parts, alternately uplifting and depressing in stages, it is an interesting read, especially for those with theatrical aspirations.  While I can appreciate the author's skillful characterizations, the overall effect was a bit \\"dark\\" for my taste.m \\"Breakfast Club\\", where you meet and get to know a group of diverse and colorful characters based solely on their interaction with each other.

The back of the dust jacket on Mann's latest novel contain raves about his previous two novels, which dealt mostly with the stereotypical gay male cruising range of casual sex, bars, baths, drugs and circuit parties.  Those expecting more of the same in \\"All American Boy\\" are in for a rude awakening.<br /><br />\\"All American Boy\\" is a skillful tapestry of characterizations surrounding the lead character, Walter, his dysfunctional birth family, the family's own secrets, and regrets concerning the other adults in his life, including Miss Aletha (the transexual who raised him after he ran away from his parents' home), Zandy (the older man to whom he willingly gave his virginity in his early teens, but was later pressured to turn him in to the authorities, resulting in his being sent to prison) and boyhood acquaintances.  He travels back to his small home town of Browns Mill, now an unemployed actor who is far from the \\"All American Boy\\" the town named him in his youth.<br /><br />Much of the story is told in a kind of stream-of-consciousness manner that mimics the thought pattern of Walter's now senile mother, who still has daytime illusions of her dead husband and sister being alive, violent dellusions of killing those who have hurt her in the past, mixed with flashbacks from her own childhood (She had run away with her sister to sing in big city taverns) and of various stages of Walter's boyhood. It's not easy to follow, and more than a bit bleak and depressing, but realistically and emotionally tells the story of a boyhood lost and a life filled with regrets, which he doesn't know how to repair.	2005-05-10

I stumbled across this one on Amazon, described as \\"an arresting story of brotherhood and betrayal, deceit and desire, set against the backdrop of a country embroiled by social change.\\"  Such recaps usually make me run the other way, but the basic underlying story ... the mysterious death of a gay teen ... sparked my interest.<br /><br />In \\"Virginia Lovers,\\" Parker presents a very powerful dramatic tale about the emotional distance between parents and teens, even in settings like small town Trent, North Carolina, which parents might think is an ideal atmosphere in which to grow up.  Thomas is the owner of the town's weekly newspaper, and deeply involved in his work to the exclusion of real communication with his wife, Caroline, and their two teenage sons.  Of the two, Thomas is really concerned only about younger Pete, who seems to have no ambition and spends his daze in a pot-induced haze.  His older son, Daniel, is the quiet straight-A student who recently went out for the school's football team, to present a well-rounded image for the prestigious scholarship he has a good chance at snagging.  The report of the death of the gay teen, an acquaintance of both boys, eventually points back on possible involvement by one or both of them, which joins them in an unlikely alliance to leave town and avoid the questions they would rather not have to answer.  Can't tell much more about it without revealing several key plot twists, but this is a book worth reading.  I give it five stars out of five.	2005-04-13

He recently realized that he is gay, and his best friend Billy, who may be gay as well, plans to leave town for New York City right after graduation.  Plans to attend the local junior college on a music scholarship are put on hold when his vivacious Aunt Samantha invites him to work at the box office of her drag show theatre in New Orleans' French Quarter, where he can be himself and explore life with his darkly handsome but also shy co-worker, Joey.  But his lingering crush on Billy come between them, especially when Billy visits New Orleans with his new boyfriend, and Mason must learn a valuable lesson.<br /><br />I found the book somewhat lightweight and predictable, but nevertheless engaging and fun to read.  I noticed more than a few  continuity errors and typos that begged for better editing (not uncommon in IUniverse publications), but do recommend this book for fans of \\"coming of age\\" novels.

But a friend alerted me to an interesting twist in John Michael Curlovich's \\"The Blood of Kings,\\" and I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The plot may sound predictable, in that a lonely gay teen, estranged from his family and away from home for the first time at college, meets a mysterious professor who befriends him, and introduces him to the dark side of Egyptian history.  But Professor Danilo teaches not only his student Jamie, but also the reader, about the interesting parts of Egyptian history (which the author later admits he took some liberties with) that suggest that gay men carry the \\"blood of kings\\" from that civilization.  That sets this novel apart from the genre, and makes it rather interesting reading.<br /><br />Jamie arrives on campus when it is already reeling from a series of mysterious deaths and disappearances, usually of student athletes like himself (He is a music major who is also a competitive swimmer).  When Jamie discovers the mutilated body of his roommate's boyfriend, he is drawn further into the mystery, seeking the comfort of his growing personal relationship with Professor Danilo, which whom he becomes lovers.  It's a relationship that leads Jamie into am new life, one he never expected but becomes convinced he was destined to lead.<br /><br />I give the author extra points for an original and interesting concept, but only an average grade for the quality of the writing overall, which I found to be lacking in parts.

If so, \\"Luncheonette\\" will be a welcome memoir for YOU too, in recreating that atmosphere, as it existed in the early 1980's in a small town New Jersey family-owned luncheonette with a flashy wisecracking and flirty waitress (think \\"Flo\\" from the Alice show, transplanted to NJ) and a diverse ethnic melting pot of eccentric customers.<br /><br />This was the world that the author found himself in when, in his early 20's, he cound his new life - as a happily-out 23 year old gay man and would-be actor in New York City - put on \\"hold\\" indefinitely so he could come back home to Long Branch NJ and run the family business, the luncheonette, when his father became abruptly paralyzed.  As the days became weeks, months and then years, Steven began to wonder if he would ever get back to his own life, or if he was doomed to spend the rest of his life grilling pork roll, egg and cheese sandwiches for characters such as \\"Half Cup Harold\\" and \\"the Giz\\".  In retrospect, this became a more important coming-of-age for Steven, to learn a lesson from his father (who did make it back to the luncheonette, in a wheelchair) about dealing with what life may bring you, and making the best of a situation that you may not be happy about.  He became closer to his father, who eventually ran for Mayor of their small town, as well as the rest of the family and the supportive customers who became almost a second family to him.

They had two boys, Brian 14 and Terry 12, both involved in school sports and running a lawncare business for summer cash, and a big ol' birddog whose antics kept them all laughing.  All this changed when Tish decided to surprise Michael, who told her he worked late every Wednesday, with a visit at his office, and discovered him leaving for an anonymous sexual encounter with another man at a highway rest stop.<br /><br />\\"Crossing The Center Line\\" gives a chillingly realistic and emotional look at the dynamics at work when a gay spouse \\"comes out\\" to the other.  From Tish's feelings of betrayal and abandonment, to Michael's self-loathing and internalized homophobia, to the kids' initial reaction to cut him out of their lives, this powerful semi-autobiographical novel by a lesbian author, who left her own long term marriage under similar circumstances, doesn't pull any punches in telling it \\"like it is\\" about the emotional, financial and psychological impact of such a revelation.  Michael and Tish take the length of the book to get on with their lives, deal with their emotional hurts and needs, and accept the fact that life will indeed never be the same again.  They try new relationships that suffer from their inability to trust someone so soon after the breakup, and work out, through trial and error, the level of familiarity they want to maintain in their continued relationship with their sons.<br /><br />This is the most outstanding book, fiction or non-fiction, I have read on this particular topic, and I recommend it highly for those involved in counseling or who know someone - \\"outed\\" or not - who may benefit from the revelations contained in the novel.	2005-01-14

Simon is seventeen and openly gay, and quickly becomes a target of harrassment in the town's lacking school district.  Elizabeth (Lizzy) is 14, a budding \\"goth girl\\" with a thick skin developed over teasing she receives about her brother.  The couple are also hoping for a new beginning following mutual instances of marital infidelity, but neither one completely trusts the other since.  Simon's sexuality has also become an issue between them, since they both believe that it is mostly genetic, and Genna never learned the identity of her birth father before her mother's death.  Jack, a social science professor, abandons a project on Nazi eugenics to start a study on the biological origins of homosexuality, which Genna resents somewhat as an attempt to \\"blame\\" her for Simon's sexuality, and encourages her to find out about her birth father.<br /><br />A memorable family trip to visit Genna's birth father, with a landmark event for young Simon and a reawakening event for his father Jack, highlights the second half of the novel.  The family's love for each other is challenged by the continued harrassment at school and at home over Simon, the discovery of Jack's affair with Simon's guidance counselor, the community's reactions to publicity about threats made against the family, possible charges over a sexually-explicit note passed by Simon to a classmate who is a minor, death threats, and Jack's guilt over his real feelings about Simon's sexuality, make for an emotionally-charged, engaging story that explores the heartbreaks and affirmations that can coincide as a family deals with a member's \\"coming out\\" to them, and how they must be strong so it does not erode the love they share.

It's beyond commendable when an author can present and develop realistic and emotionally-complete characters one can identify with so completely, to the point where a sequel feels like a visit with old friends. After reading the first two wonderful books in this series, that's exactly the feeling I got from \\"Finding Hope,\\" the latest in the series.<br /><br />We find that life has gone on for Taylor (senior partner of a successful law firm on the outskirts of his adopted home town, Pine Creek) and his life-partner Tom (now close to his PhD, while teaching at the local college and helping out at the bakery he co-owns with Taylor), as well as their small adoptive children and members of their \\"extended family\\", including Gen (now mayor of the town) and Pete (Taylor's business partner and a good friend). It is also a \\"coming of age\\" time for their young ward Wayne (just finished his junior year at the university, and manager of their bakery), his boyfriend Eric and their best friends Dan and Emmy. We learn that the relationship between Eric and Wayne took a detour while Eric finished his degree at Ohio State, with Dan becoming Wayne's roommate to help him through that difficult time.<br /><br />When it becomes known that an aggressive real estate developer is looking to buy the store next to the bakery, Tom and Taylor decide to bid against him, primarily to protect the quaint historical shopping district from becoming the target of bigger chain stores.  At the suggestion of Wayne and his friends, they decide to open a coffee shop in the adjacent space, connected directly to the bakery. The new store provides an employment opportunity for Jason, who lives above the store, and quickly becomes popular with the local townspeople. Meanwhile, Gen hears that the real estate developer plans to run against her in the next mayoral election, and enlists Taylor's help in fighting him off. Eric returns to town, on a temporary hiatus before starting employment in the city with a big corporation, and he starts courting Wayne again, although Wayne holds him at arms length, afraid of being hurt again. An unexpected accident puts Eric, Taylor and Pete's unborn child at risk. Taylor plans a hotly-anticipated debate between Gen and the developer, and increasing time demands with their businesses, on top of their own careers and family, make Taylor and Tom wonder if they spread themselves too thin, and are unfairly depending on Wayne to do too much.<br /><br />\\"Finding Hope\\" is a delightful, positively mesmerizing tale about a place you will wish you lived, with people you feel you already know, but would like to know better. As I said after the second book, I can definitely see success if the author ever tried to adapt this into a television series, perhaps on Showtime to replace QAF, or on one of the new gay cable networks offering original programming.

Benjamin Justice, a semi-retired journalist who often becomes a reluctant amateur private eye, is hired by the City of West Hollywood to finish a brochure about its historical buildings, following the apparent murder of the man originally entrusted with that job.  Since his last run-in with crime, which cost him severe injuries including loss of one eye, Justice has vowed not to \\"get involved\\" in investigations, and relies on his daily dose of Prozac to keep him minding his own business.<br /><br />But, as regular readers of the series are well aware, circumstances involve him.  His best friend, LA Times reporter Alexandra Templeton, gets an exclusive with a scientist who presents a study that the police's suspect, a 20 year old Russian immigrant, may have beeen genetically predisposed to become a murderer.  Benjamin meets the young man, and believes him to be innocent, although circumstancial evidence and his presence at a second murder seems to indicate otherwise.  As Justice researches the brochure, he becomes deeply involved in the politically-charged battle between historical preservationists vs real estate developers, with both sides aggresively soliciting his support, and gets a deeper sense that these groups are somehow involved in the murders.  He also keeps coming across the name of a handsome bisexual drifter who was involved with some of these people, and who disappeared thirty years before.  When Alexandra stubbornly refuses to believe his theories, largely due to her involvement with the scientist who believes the young man is the murderer, Justice becomes an intentional thorn-in-the-side of some of these dangerous characters, to see if they reveal their roles.<br /><br />With this, his sixth Benjamin Justice mystery novel, John Morgan Wilson seems to just get better and better.  His books are uniformly well-written, original, intelligent in tone, offering realistic characters in first-rate mysteries.  Author Wilson has a guest column in a current issue of the Advocate, commenting on the 20th anniversary of the incorporation of the City of West Hollywood, his place of residence which is featured almost like a character in many of his Benjamin Justice novels, especially this one.  His writing, both in the column and this book, reveal a genuine respect for the city's history, diversity and tolerance, as well as a wink at the colorful characters and celebrities who frequent its streets, shops and cafes.  I consider this book his best in the series, and give it a plump five stars out of five.ent issue of the Advocate, commenting on the 20th anniversary of the incorporation of the City of West Hollywood, his place of residence which is featured almost like a character in many of his Benjamin Justice novels, especially this one.

The men in the movie industry in Hollywood have lots of money, and money may not be able to buy you love, but it can certainly buy some pretty memorable sex!  Such is the basic concept of \\"One Night Stand,\\" the story of Derek, a young man who moved to California to become an actor, so he naturally ended up working as a waiter instead. When the classy restaurant he worked at closes its doors without notice, Derek has trouble finding another job, and ends up considering working as a paid escort.  He places an ad in a magazine to solicit \\"legit\\" massage clients, and one of the first responses is Tom, a hunky attorney, who brings him along to a party at the house of Brent Richardson, a famous actor.  Derek later finds out that this was a bit of an \\"audition\\" to be Brent's live-in lover, a job he can't afford not to accept.  Meanwhile, Derek's best friend and former co-worker, Juan, gets a job as a houseboy for a Hollywood power couple, and ends up having sex with the husband.<br /><br />Derek finds that life as Brent Richardson's live-in lover can be rather draining, even when Brent is out of town for some time on a movie shoot, as Tom informs Derek that Brent expects him to \\"entertain\\" his many friends and acquaintances in a similar manner.  Although the pay is great, Derek becomes physically and emotionally tired of the pace, and has the idea to \\"outsource\\" some of the other encounters to paid escorts he chooses and pays directly.  What Derek doesn't realize is that this activity makes him noticed by a notorious and dangerous \\"panderer for the stars,\\" who considers him competition and threatens to ruin him financially and physically.  It's not until a climatic scene near the end of the book that we learn the true source of that threat, and Brent learns that not everyone he has encountered has been completely honest with him.<br /><br />It's a vividly wicked and scintillating story which, although fiction, seems quite believeable as giving a look at what likely does exist in Hollywood, at some level.  The explicitly (safe) sexual content does not seem out of place, considering the story is primarily about the interactions between those selling sex and buying it, though it also enforces the importance of honesty and loyalty in any relationship.  I've read and enjoyed Tyler's three previous full-length novels (\\"Gay Blades,\\" \\"Hell House\\" and \\"Tricks of the Trade\\"), as well as his three short stories in recent Kennsington compilations, and I definitely consider this one the best written and most enjoyable of the bunch.does exist in Hollywood, at some level.

His background isn't different from many either, having sought a new life in California after severing ties with his fundamentalist Southern family (by mutual agreement, after he \\"came out\\" to them as gay).<br /><br />But the story begins eight years later, when he has an unexpected reunion he has with that family, in Charlotte, North Carolina, when he returns for the funeral of his favorite Aunt Walterene.  Derek quickly faces the same bigotry and status-seeking hypocrisy in most of the members of his family, especially his mother Gladys and his uncle Vernon, who is running for the Senate.  His refuge is the house of his Aunt Ruby, who was Walterene's life partner, and his unmarried older sister Valerie.  Derek also gets to spend some time with his older cousin Mark (Vernon's son), who was his first lover, before Mark decided he needed to \\"play it straight\\" and get married, in order to achieve success in the family's huge construction business.<br /><br />In helping Ruby sort through Walterene's belongings, Derek comes across her girlhood diary, where she suggests that the reported lynching by the Klu Klux Klan of a black former family employee may have actually been done by Vernon and his father, over reports that the man had mollested Gladys as a girl.  When a newspaper reporter picks up on the fact that Vernon Harris has a gay nephew, it becomes a political embarassment to the conservative \\"traditional values\\" candidate, and Derek is urged to leave town.  Deciding to stay to help Ruby for a while, he becomes the target of a mysterious raspy-voiced assailant who tries to scare him out of town, which he believes may be related to his asking around concerning the lynching.<br /><br />\\"Fingering the Family Jewels\\" is a captivating, sexy, fast-paced and extremely creative mystery, exposing how greed and misplaced family loyalties can result in a pattern of lies, deceit, incest and possibly murder.  Author Greg Lilly, previously a writer of short stories who has a background as a technical analyst (and worked at a family-owned company that provided the inspiration for this first novel), hits a home-run with this intelligent, sensitive and highly engrossing masterpiece.

Each of the titles currently in print are relatively short (under 200 pages), quick reads, all with simplistic graphic-similar covers.<br /><br />\\"Spare Parts\\" tells the story of Dan, the 36 year old workaholic owner of several automotive repair shops in a small city.  After realizing there is something missing in his life, he goes out one night and meets Trent, a 27 year old struggling artist, whom Dan believes to be a male prostitute.  They move in together, but each has a secret that he is afraid the other will learn:  for Trent, the fact that he really isn't a hustler, and for Dan a realization that they had met about 10-12 years earlier, and Dan had not been very nice to him.  Dan offers to have Trent trained as a mechanic to work in one of his shops, but Trent shows absolutely no aptitude for the profession, and appearances of Dan's \\"kept boy\\" at the shop fuel already existing business-hurting rumors that Dan seduces his young employees.  They face their problems with the help of Trent's former roommate, a flamboyant young gay man named Nathan, and one of Dan's customers, Ida, who is impressed by Trent's photography.<br /><br />Predictable storyline, and proofreading is obviously not one of their priorities.  Not far removed from old paperback gay \\"friction\\" novels, with numerous sexually explicit scenes, though the accent is more on the relationship than the mechanics of their lovemaking. An amusing light read for those who don't want much of a plot to get in the way of the action.	2004-11-13

During his preliminary investigation, he finds his boyfriend, Paul, is somehow involved with one of the suspects in the case.  Eventually, Chanse finds out that Paul had a secret past as a well-known \\"erotic wrestler\\" in gay videos, which makes Chanse doubt how well he really knows his boyfriend.  When Paul is then arrested for the murder of one of the other suspects, Chanse fights an inner battle between his feelings and loyalty to his boyfriend and his instincts as an investigator, a battle that isn't completely resolved when Paul is cleared of the charges and promptly disappears.<br /><br />A captivating mystery of deceptions, kinky obsessions, unshared pasts, loyalties, and mob ties, well-written as is all of Herren's works.

I found his \\"Running With Scissors\\" more disturbing than amusing or entertaining, and I only<br /><br />liked \\"Dry\\" slightly better than that. Perhaps \\"the third time is the charm,\\" since his latest book provides a better insight into his personality, including his mindset when writing those last two works.<br /><br />\\"Magical Thinking\\" (named after a psychological profile in which one attributes to one's actions something which they could not have anything to do with ... such as believing that one can *will* bad or good things to happen to someone.) is actually a collection of 29 brief (averaging less than 8 pages) musings by the author, some of which had previously appeared on Salon.com. The author comes across as a gay, slightly psychotic Dave Barry in some, satirically looking at consumer resistence to advertising, design-it-yourself custom homes, getting revenge at telemarketers, and a few other topics. In others, the more-than-slightly-off-center author's voice comes through, in talking about his envy of transexuals, having sex with<br /><br />several priests, studying to be a model, gay men's devotion to<br /><br />steroids, and various \\"boyfriend from hell\\" stories. He also<br /><br />provides some additional insight into his childhood, his motivation to write the earlier two novels as well as his first book (Sellevision), and openly discusses his relationship with a slightly older man he sometimes affectiionately calls \\"The Schnauzer.\\" They are generally amusing and well-written, but the random nature of the stories makes the book seem rather disjointed in total, and unlikely to be anywhere near as successful as his last two attempts. However, if his earlier books did arouse your curiousity to know more about this rather unique individual, you may (as I did) find this volume useful for that purpose. I may even go back and read his \\"Sellevision\\".sion\\".	2004-11-02

The sex provides an excuse to do drugs to \\"get in the mood,\\" and both fulfill Ron's emotional need to lose control and be dominated by outside forces, a throwback to his childhood.  While Johann originally scoffed at Ron's drug use, he eventually was drawn into the escapist world the author wanted for both of them, with fatal results.<br /><br />The book deals honestly with the author's addictions and compulsions, including the best analysis of the immediate and after-effects of crystal meth I have ever seen in print. The reader can easily see that the author's behavior and mindset changes dramatically when with the hustler, even before drugs are consumed, as compared to his business trips to Los Angeles or New York City, at home at his country retreat in Woodstock NY, or on his increasingly-frequent pilgrimages back to Pennsylvania to care for his parents in their rapidly failing health.  We get the sense that the author both looks forward to and dreads his drug-hazed \\"vacations\\" with Johann, and deludes himself into not really thinking about what he gets out of these encounters, whether it is the drugs, Johann's (often platonic) company, or why they both seem to be a necessity in this stage of his life.  Further disappointments in his life lead to self-mutilation and a botched suicide attempt, as the book depicts how difficult a journey it was ... and continues to be while he is in recovery today.	2004-10-28

He feels he has a particular handcap in that endeavor, since his forte' is in creative arts, where once need to be a bit \\"wild\\" and unpredictable, but his illness forces him to stay on medication to keep his \\"wildness\\" from getting out of control.  His debut album, put together when he was off his meds, turned out to be tremendous disappointment to him.<br /><br />Then his luck changed. With his partner, composer Calliope, Adam gets in on the ground floor of developing a Britany Spears-ish teenage vocal diva, Christie Squires, who turns out to be financially rewarding to all.  And while accompanying Christie to a Today show appearance, Adam meets Lyle, a foreign affairs commentator for CNN, who is a big fan of Adam's work, including his solo album.  They set up housekeeping as Adam rides the \\"Christie\\" train for a few years, until his meal ticket decides to sue him and his partners for a higher share of song profits.  Dejected, Adam decides to \\"reinvent\\" himself, on his way to being \\"a serious person,\\" and auditions for a reality show for singer-songwriters that is a cross between \\"American Idol\\" and \\"Big Brother.\\"  Among the other participants is Sam, a young singer who he suspects of trying to steal Lyle from him, and Christie, his former protege.<br /><br />The book is alternately witty and philosophical in tone, with some dark moments when Adam explores his \\"head\\" when off his medication. I've read all of Orland's novels, and this is probably my least favorite, likely because I cannot really relate to any of the characters, though I appreciate the obvious satire of the reality TV genre.

The first thing that makes author Paul D. Cain's first book unique is that he goes beyond the \\"usual\\" names to feature an extremely diverse group of 39 men and women, who indeed have all significantly influenced our community in some way.  Some are front line activists, but many are better known for their efforts \\"behind the scenes\\" as teachers, artists, authors, composers, publishers, preachers, or simply openly living their lives at a time or place where role models made a great difference in the lives of young gay men and lesbians.<br /><br />The book is divided into five logical sections, charactizing the nature of the individuals' contributions.  Each individual has his or her own chapter containing an interview in which the author takes an active part, adding his own non-judgemental observations and opinions based on his experiences.  It is obvious from his enthusiasm in his questioning that this was a labor of love, one that his notes says took him over five years to put together, crisscrossing the country.  Many of his interviewees are no longer in the public eye, and live very private lives, which made it more of a challenge to locate them and get their cooperation to be interviewed.  And his chapters are full of interesting comments from each interviewee's friends and associates, providing additional insights into their lives by those who knew them best.<br /><br />This engaging book makes for an interesting read, and a valuable lesson for gays and lesbians of all ages about the pioneers to whom we owe a great deal of thanks for the advances made by our community over the past half century.	2004-10-17

He knows it is an addiction of sorts, like online porn or gambling, but doesn't seem to be able to help himself, even though he realizes that at his age (early 30's) it is time to cut the crap and think about settling down.<br /><br />The shallowness of his life becomes even more evident when someone comes up to him and shoots him in the leg and hand, resulting in hospitalization and a long recovery.  When the police ask who might have done this, who could hate him enough to shoot him, Tony realizes he can name a long list of ex-boyfriends who have either expressed their hatred toward him before, as well as others who were equally hurt but hadn't openly expressed that hostility ... perhaps until now.<br /><br />We learn the backstory of Tony's life, the child of a Danish mother and a - long gone - Mexican father, who grew up with his mother and senile-bordering-on-lunacy paternal grandmother in a big old house that was falling apart around them.  The house was removated by his mother's new husband, who actually was Tony's former lover he met while on vacation in Denmark, and whom he still occasionally gets together with sexually.  Not exactly the Cleavers!<br /><br />With a degree in art, but not disciplined enough to actually try to make a living as an artist, the closest Tony gets is the faux paintings and murals he creates for a variety of eccentric rich clients who hire him as a house painter.  He also owns a racing greyhound, who seems more disturbed by Tony when they have to move suddenly when the current boyfriend throws them out.  Tony is trying to change his ways, which isn't easy when being stalked by ex-lovers who have hopes of reconciliation, being taunted on the air by one ex who created a popular radio show about jilted lovers, and when boredom beckons him to get out the sketch pad and go looking for a new OOD.<br /><br />Excellent character study of a \\"love 'em and leave 'em\\" personality, with colorful supporting characters making the journey engaging and entertaining.

In his introduction to this short story collection, Greg Herren points out that gay people often feel left out during the holiday season.  Either we are heading back to fanily gatherings (which may be equal parts annoyance and comfort), or we may be left alone because our friends or partners are leaving to do so.  It's a very family oriented holiday, one to which our extended \\"families\\" often have problems adapting.  And there really aren't any purely-gay Christmas stories ... until now.<br /><br />\\"Upon A Midnight Clear\\" is a collection of 15 holiday-themed stories by an impressive list of gay fiction authors, including Jim Grimsley and, Felice Picano.  The length of each story ranges from 5-34 pages, and they are too numerous to review individually here.  Just be aware that some are rather dark, and may not do much to brighten a lack of \\"holiday spirit,\\" except perhaps to let you know you're not alone.<br /><br />Especially noteworthy:<br /><br />\\"It's A Life\\" by M Christiansen is a creative ten page remake of the final scenes of the holiday classic \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", with George Bailey the president of the Castro (San Francisco gay area) Merchants Association.<br /><br />\\"Skating\\" by Stephen Soucy tells of a ghost who appears to his grieving partner, to help him get on with his life.<br /><br />\\".. a very special Christmas\\" by Kevin Allman points out that many of our best Christmas memories have to do with the corny Christmas specials we saw on TV during our childhood, including the campy \\"Pee-wee's Playhouse Christmas Special\\" (which, coincidentally, is being released for the first time on DVD next month).<br /><br />Jay Quinn's \\"Our Family Things\\" realistically explores the feelings surrounding the breakup of a gay couple together for many years.<br /><br /> \\"The Snow Queen\\" by Quentin Harrington is a spooky tale about a mysterious stranger who captures and imprisons guys he picks up at gay bars.	2004-09-22

Since I am not usually a fan of the \\"vampire\\" fiction genre, I usually would not have chosen this book, a 321-page compilation of four erotic short stories about gay vampires.  In retrospect, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Of the four stories, my least favorite was Timothy Ridge's \\"The Vampire Stone,\\" simply because it had a rather convoluted plot, bouncing back and forth between modern and ancient times  It is, however, a well written tale about an antiques dealer who comes across a mysterious wooden box from the 16th century, which changes his life forever.<br /><br />I enjoyed Herren's \\"The Nightwatchers\\", which, like his novels, is based in New Orleans.  Phillip is a 20-something would-be-actor working as a waiter and moonlighting as a male escort.  After Phillip first spots the aluring and seductive Kevin Lockhart in a contest at a gay bar, his best friend Rachel finds herself working with a mysterious old man to save him from the consequences of his lust.<br /><br />Michael Thomas Ford's \\"Carnival\\" brings us to the dark side of the lives of those who left their rural homes to tour with the carnival, as reclusive lifetime midway handyman Joe Flanagan finds his soulmate in Derry, a young man who is a new addition to their traveling show.  He is warned to stay away from Derry by Mr. Star, the curator of the \\"freak show\\" wing of the carnival, and he finds himself caught up in a coverup of a series of murders.<br /><br />My favorite out of the four was the very creative and entertaining  \\"Vampire, Inc.\\" by Sean Wolfe, which brings a \\"Vampires are people too!\\"-type vibe to the book.  We meet notorious vampire Christo, still bitter over the death of his lover centuries ago, as he arrives in Denver CO, and takes in the local bar scene looking to \\"feed.\\"  Having been to Denver, I know at least two of the bars mentioned are real, as is his description of the gay scene there.

From this and his previous works in the series, it's obvious that Lev Raphael (whose bio calls him an \\"escaped academic\\") has significant \\"issues\\" with the politics and bickering found in small educational institutions, and it does occasionally distract from his stories, if not related directly to the college atmosphere and characters.  That is the case here, where he devotes more than the first third of the book just establishing that things were tense, and Nick and Stefan felt the need to \\"get away\\" for a while.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, Nick and Stefan take off for a quiet (they hoped) vacation at a Club Med resort on a small Caribbean island, which it coincidentally turns out was previously owned by the family that runs a small private college in Michigan.  They are surprised to see a colleague/grad student from SUM, but it becomes revealed that he had suggested the place to Stefan, hoping that he could convince Nick to do some amateur investigating for him.  This takes a back seat to their attempt to enjoy their vacation, which inevitably is interrupted by the untimely and mysterious death of one of the club employees.  Since they were the ones who found the body, Nick and Stefan ask around to see if anyone noticed anything suspicious.  The mystery is solved quite abruptly, with little buildup, and most of the details are told as flashbacks when the author spends the last ten pages of the book having Nick, now back in Michigan, tell his sister Sharon (the recent victim of a stroke, living in NYC) about their trip, and some tentative plans if the situation at SUM doesn't improve (I can only guess this part of the book is meant to \\"set up\\" the next book in the series.)<br /><br />I have been a fan of this series of books since its start, but was a bit disappointed in this one.  I found the pacing of the story to be rather disjointed and distracting. In a book weighing it at just 208 pages, the first 70 are taken up by the bureaucratic doings at SUM, before the duo leaves.  The murder comes in at page 144, with the \\"who done it\\" revealed just 50 pages later, followed by the ten pages of chatter with sister Sharon. With likeable characters and a basic good, unpredictable amd credible plot, I believe this would have been a lot better if the extraneous stuff was cut back, and the mystery revealed not so quickly.  I don't know if that has anything to do with the book being the first of the series to go directly to paperback (rather than following a hardcover release), but it definitely feels that Raphael may be tiring of the characters.  This had the potential to be a 5-star, but best I can do is give it a (generous) 4 out of 5 for now.disappointed in this one.  I found the pacing of the story to be rather disjointed and distracting.

With likeable characters and a basic good, unpredictable amd credible plot, I believe this would have been a lot better if the extraneous stuff was cut back, and the mystery revealed not so quickly.  I don't know if that has anything to do with the book being the first of the series to go directly to paperback (rather than following a hardcover release), but it definitely feels that Raphael may be tiring of the characters.  This had the potential to be a 5-star, but best I can do is give it a (generous) 4 out of 5 for now.	2004-09-13
US	44359438	R136SYWOFDHTX5	0916397939	431697541	Gutterboys	Books	4	4	6	N	Y	A look into being a gay urban youth in 1980	\\"Gutterboys\\" is a journey through the early 1980's in the San Francisco and New York City gay/new wave scenes, with the pre-AIDS world of backroom bars, adult bookstores and baths.  Jeremy is a shy 19 year old gay teen who meets, idolizes and immediately falls into an unrequitted love for the older, more worldly and eclectic but somewhat emotionally disturbed Colin. Somewhat distanced from his parents, Jeremy receives constant advice from the spirits of his two dead grandmas, one a formal British lady and the other a sarcastic Jewish socialist, but relies on his own gut feelings when he relocates to NYC to be with Colin.  Though not interested in Jeremy as a lover, Colin makes him a protege' of sorts, teaching him how to cruise in bars, how to dress to be noticed there, what to read, and how to pick up extra money by hustling.  Jeremy has fun, but becomes increasingly disappointed with Colin's resistance to him, although they spend almost every waking hour together.<br /><br />I found it rather amusing that the author included a prologue meant to remind older readers (or inform younger readers) about how different life was in 1980, where the novel is set.  The epidemic of AIDS and the war on drugs was yet to happen, Times Square was more debauchery than Disney-fied, Reagan was president, no cell phones, no internet, small cars (rather than SUVs) were popular, \\"Pac Man\\" was \\"in\\", and music was making the transition from disco to new wave.  Probably a good idea, since the novel's impact depends on that period.<br /><br />Not a great work of literature, but I found it engaging and somewhat entertaining.  Good interplay between Colin and Jeremy, showing their very different backgrounds and personalities that only illustrated what they also had in common.	2004-09-05

In this landmark 10TH mystery in the \\"Tom & Scott Mystery\\" series, we join high school teacher Tom Mason, as he arrives early one Saturday morning to do some volunteer work at the local gay/lesbian teen counseling center.  He decides to catch up on some filing in the office he shares, and opens a file cabinet drawer, finding a severed head.  Being no stranger to having the misfortune to stumble upon a murder, Tom tries to work with the police to find the killer.  The problem is that the victim was the unusually unpleasant and nasty manager of the center, and there is no shortage of people who were glad to see the end of the man referred to - by employees and volunteers alike - as \\"Snarly Bitch\\".  Various pieces of circumstantial evidence seem to point to just about everyone, including Tom himself.<br /><br />The number one suspect seems to be Lee Weaver, a young man working as a counselor who Tom first met as a gay teen who came to him for help while in school.  Tom believes Lee is innocent, but evidence surfaces that suggests he may not have told him (or the police) the entire truth about his activities the night of the murder.<br /><br />As usual, this Zubro mystery has a \\"message within the story\\" and this time it is a sobering commentary about the counterproductive politics and internal machinations of the gay teen counseling center and other factions within the gay community.  Tom was aware of the staff and voluntter strife, and some grandstanding and feather-ruffling going on with its Board of Directors, but talking with most of the kids who go to the counseling center makes him aware of what huge impact this has had on them over the years.<br /><br />Tom's baseball-player partner, Scott, is mostly absent (on the road with his team) during this installment in the series, which makes it different from most.  Like the others, it is well-written and holds the reader's attention throughout.  Perhaps partially because I previously volunteered for an organization similar to the one featured in the story, I was especially riveted to this story, which had an ending that took me completely by surprise.anization similar to the one featured in the story, I was especially riveted to this story, which had an ending that took me completely by surprise.	2004-08-20

Many residents of tiny Dumont WI are excited that two of its largest employers, Ashton Mills and Quatro Press, are in the process of merging, a move designed to ensure the financial and commercial future of both.  On the Board of Directors of both is Mark Manning, publisher of The Dumont Daily Register, the local paper, and he gave the merger his blessing.  Now he is becoming aware of some possible financial irregularities having been disclosed in the pre-merger \\"due dilligence\\" audit, which Aston's CEO, Gillian Reese, discounts as irrelevant to the merger.  While Reese is a business associate with whom he is on generally good terms, Mark knows that he is generally disliked for her confrontational lack of people skills, so it isn't too much of a shock when Reese turns up dead at the her new home being designed by Mark's lifepartner, Neil, who is one of the few individuals who seems to get along with her.  Mark considers that the death may or may not be an accident, as the coroner initially rules it to be.  After all, off the top of his head, Mark can think of several people who may have wished Ms. Reese dead, including his own society editor, Glee Savage, and Todd Draper, a curtain designer who actually was slapped by Gillian in an argument over how the curtains should look.<br /><br />Author Craft includes a preface to the novel that warns that this, his seventh and final \\"Mark Manning Mystery\\" in the series, includes a few twists and turns designed to make it less predictable and more enjoyable.  I can't go much into that without divulging important points of the story, but suffice it to say that the changes will make the reader realize he may not have known Mark Manning as well as he thought.  It's a life-altering adventure, and not just for Mark and Neil.<br /><br />The epilogue to the novel, which goes on to update you on some of the characters in the years after the action, make it apparent that Craft indeed plans to retire his Mark Manning character, at least as the star of his series of books (He may appear in the \\"Claire Gray\\" series, which include Manning's nephew as one of her students).  I may be reading more into the final paragraphs than he meant, but it sounds like a hint that the decision isn't carved in stone, and, given the right circumstances, we may hear from this interesting character again.

This triggers a kind of \\"early midlife crisis\\" ...  which I have actually witnessed in several gay acquaintances over the years ... which causes him to \\"get buff\\" and then go on a hedonistic binge of drugs, alcohol, casual sex and wild partying.<br /><br />The evolution of Martin (the main character) is paralleled by his straight best friend/fag hag Caroline, who becomes mad at herself for ruining what could have been a great relationship, and goes on a self-destrictive binge of drugs herself.  Martin also becomes more and more like his friend John, whom Martin previously looked down on as being shallow and insincere in his sexual/romantic habits.  The novel touches on drug use (especially \\"K\\" and \\"E\\", the ones most favored by party boys, both gay and straight), some tentative voyages into the gay S&M scene, a visit by Martin's father (who gets into the partying as well), and being \\"out\\" in the workplace.<br /><br />It's not great literature, but is a somewhat entertaining light read, one most suited to those like the pre-change Martin who want to sample the \\"party boy\\" life for a while (Not my style, but, from what I have been told, the depiction is fairly accurate.)  By the end of the story, Martin and some other characters learn there are consequences to their irresponsible actions, and Martin and Caroline both go back to their earlier less-adverturous personas.<br /><br />Personally, I considered the back cover notes to be an accurate depiction of what the novel was about.  \\"Sex and the City\\" did feature at least one character whose sexual appetite and choices were rather far-fetched, and the same is true with some characters in \\"Queer As Folk.\\"  Neither of those shows claimed to depict the behavior of all or most single heterosexual women (or, for QAF, gay men), but there is no doubt that some people like that DO exist.  If you care not to know anything about them, and want to pretend they don't exist, then perhaps this book isn't for you.  But I would not criticize the author or publisher for presenting it, as is, for those who may be more open minded about the subject.aracters in \\"Queer As Folk.\\"  Neither of those shows claimed to depict the behavior of all or most single heterosexual women (or, for QAF, gay men), but there is no doubt that some people like that DO exist.

Except for his other novel, \\"Last Summer,\\" Michael Thomas Ford is known primarily for his compilations of his humorous essays, such as \\"My Big Fat Queer Life\\" and \\"That's MR. Faggot to You!\\"  Perhaps looking to distance himself further from his humor essays, his second novel, \\"Looking for It\\" comes off as rather dark in spots, though overall realistic and with a positive message.<br /><br />The novel tells us about a group of gay men in a small upstate NY town.  The main character is Mike, bartender at The Engine Room, the only gay bar in about a two hour radius; Mike is kind of a free spirit who has no long term plans or any conscious desire to settle down.  On the other end of the spectrum is Stephen, a closeted accountant whose sex life is solely imaginary with online partners, and Thomas, a closeted Episcopal priest dealing with feelings he had thought were successfully repressed.  Add in a mature gay couple whose relationship is trying to survive the \\"seven year itch,\\" and a wise old queen named Simon who has resogned himself to be alone since the death of his longtime partner, and you have most of the characters for the novel's coverage of developments in their lives between Halloween and New Years of a recent year.  There are some steps forward, some steps backward, and some tough decisions that could affect their makers for many years to come.  The \\"dark\\" part of the story comes mostly from the involvement of an additional character, a self-hating \\"straight\\" men using violence to deal with his homosexual urges, preying upon the insecurity of gay men he encountered at a porn cinema and via the internet.<br /><br />I thought the story was somewhat predictable, though the characters were original, portrayed well and put in realistic situations for small town living.  The overall message is a positive one, of \\"community\\" and entended families, although it also seems to suggest that gay men, at least in small towns such as this, really don't know what they want out of life, even if it is in front of their eyes.  I give this one four stars out of five, including extra credit for recognizing all gay men don't live in big cities or gay \\"meccas\\" like P-Town and WeHo.y want out of life, even if it is in front of their eyes.

Your sister has been kidnapped by \\"Christian\\" terrorists who demand seven million dollars and that you publicly renounce your homosexuality through the Lord.<br />This is the dilemma faced by Rico Brandywine, the 30-something openly-gay heir to the Brandywine Hotel empire, whose sister and confidant Valencia disappeared when flying to join him for a business-related charity event.  While kidnapping is nothing new to the Brandywine children, whose family fortune made them a popular target throughout their childhoods, the fact that they are now adults, and the religious connotations to the terrorist's demands, make this seem very different.<br />But Rico has his own problems, explored for years through a continuing cast of therapists.  He is still smarting a bit from the end of a relationship with an egomaniac television reporter, finds he needs to bite his tongue to avoid spewing sexual obscenities at inopportune moments, is embarrassed that he frequently gets an erection when shaking hands with people he hardly knows, and wonders about a series of coincidences where people he has met later reveal that have \\"come out\\" from their previously latent homosexuality.  His best friend, D'Vora Wasserman, joins him to lend emotional support, and the twosome end up traveling to Israel based on a clue Rico believes Valencia leaked in a phone call demanding ransom.  Along the way, Rico learns he has a very special power, which both fortifies and terrifies him at the same time.<br />A good beach read, Cooper's second novel (after \\"With You In Spirit\\") presents a witty but plausible mystery that will delight readers.	2004-07-16

As soon as I read the publisher's summary of \\"The Deal,\\" I knew I'd like it, since I am admittedly a sucker for light \\"chatty\\" books in which diverse gay/lesbian/straight folks interact and get along.  And I was not disappointed.<br />\\"The Deal\\" tells the story of a group of longtime friends in their late 20's/early 30's, all living in the Montrose area of Houston TX, during the year 2000.  The main character/narrator is Aaron, an openly gay English literature teacher who gets along well with his closeknit parents and sisters.  His roommate is Patrick, a straight-but-not-narrow owner of a local bar, who has a girlfriend, Vivian, who is in lawschool.  There's also Alexander, a gay musician who is somewhat private, and Miranda, a lesbian who makes her own line of jewelry.  Last but not least, there's Heath, who was in a relationship with Aaron when they were younger, and recently re-entered their clique after moving back to Houston.<br />After realizing that their frequent dinners and nights out were often bogged down by the single members whining about failed relationships, the friends make \\"The Deal\\" to refrain from talking about their relationships except for at one monthly \\"Love Sucks\\" gathering, where they were free to vent as much as they want.  Alexander and Miranda, the chief \\"whiners\\" of the group, also have until the following New Year's Eve to find a relationship, or forever lose the right to whine about lost loves to their friends. What's more, if both are successful in finding love this year, then Aaron (a self-proclaimed loner) must find a relationship the following year, or suffer the same fate.<br />You can't but help identifying with this colorful group of characters, sharing their joys and disappointments, and wanting them all to find someone to love.  We root for Miranda in her efforts to get Joey, the female drummer of Alex's new rock group, to go out with her, and for Aaron and Heath to get over the hurt feelings of the past and give a relationship another try.  When Alex meets a guy at the gym he starts to date, but complains that the guy doesn't want him to call him at home, or to be out anywhere where others are likely to see him, and isn't available on holidays, you are ready to yell \\"He's married, you idiot!\\" even before one of his friends clues him in on that.  And you feel the professional quandry Aaron finds himself in, when an (untrue) rumor starts that he was dating one of his male students.  There's colorful additional characters as well, both straight and gay, and you soon wonder \\"Why can't my friends be that great?\\"<br />A extremely enjoyable, light read, definitely in the genre of previous novels by Timothy James Beck (\\"He's the One,\\" \\"It Had to Be You\\"), the pen name of a writing group that includes the authors of this book.

He decides to end his life by throwing himself overboard on the second leg of a US/Caribean ocean cruise he booked before this happened.  However, he disenbarks at the first stop, Key West FL, finds a life he never knew existed, and never goes back.<br />Key West has the reputation of being an artist-oriented, liberal, live-and-let-live town with remarkably open and caring residents, most of whom were also once \\"outsiders\\" who found the city and fell in love with it.  This impression is reinforced by this debut novel from a talented author, which makes one want to pack up and catch the next flight down to this southernmost point in Florida.  From the Cuban influence, to the tourist industry, gay and lesbian residents mixed with heterosexual \\"swingers,\\" old houses with fascinating histories, to a fine mix of colorful characters that eventually become a surrogate \\"second family\\" for Michael, in every sense of the word, it becomes more than obvious that Key West is the \\"medicine\\" to heal this doctor, who discovers talents he never even knew he had, and explores his homosexual leanings which he has kept repressed for many sad years.  In the end, Michael becomes a bit of a \\"healer\\" (and I don't mean medically) himself, helping his new friends to achieve some of their own dreams.<br />A beautiful, emotionally-rich story, which I strongly recommend.	2004-06-08

And, oh yes, he keeps the pool clean (Clearly not the reason for his hiring, since the D.O.M. employer seems to use the pool only a few times all summer.)<br />I found the novel actually a bit sad in places, as the employer (a financially-rich writer in his late 50's) clearly lusts over the boy, spying on him every chance he can, but is afraid of scaring him away by making a move. Robert (the employer) also suffers pangs of jealouy when Kent (the pool boy) goes out to drink with a friend closer to his age, and this turns to rage when he finds out that the two of them have had sex.  Of course, they do eventually get together, though it's clear that the relationship has become more of a \\"mentor\\" relationship than the writer intended it to be.  It's obviously not meant to be great literature, but the timing is good, the characters are amazingly complex for a novel of this calibre, and quality of the writing is beyond average.  Recommended as escapist reading for those who may be interested in the story.	2004-05-01

We also are reunited with Scotty's hippie parents, his lawyer-brother Storm, African-American police detective Ms. Venus Casanova, Scotty's long distance boyfriend (Frank, an FBI agent), and a former lover who forms a triangle that makes Scotty doubt his feelings for Frank. Readers who love New Orleans (where this and the previous novel are based) will especially like the local color provided by the author, who obviously holds a fondness for the city as well.<br />To be honest, I thought the book was a bit \\"light\\". not so much in plot but moreso in character development (Although we do learn a bit more about characters introduced in the earlier novel).  Otherwise, it was an entirely engrossing and enjoyable mystery, with lots of nail-biting situations (Perhaps too many, some would say), leaving you wanting more. (It's obvious in the final pages that Herren is setting up some situations for a third novel in the series, which I would look forward to.)<br />Not for readers who cannot deal with the numerous new-age references, belief in psychic experiences, tarot cards, etc., which are an intergral part of Scotty's character.	2004-05-01

Jan Phillips is an 18 year old recent high school grad, who heads to Philadelphia after being thrown out of his small town PA home by his widowed mother, who can't afford to care for him anymore.  He heard from other boys that good looking, masculine guys can earn money hustling in the Tenderloin district in the city, which he decides to try, although he is still a virgin and not even sure of his own sexuality.<br />On his first night hustling, Jan has the good fortune to attract the attention of Tim Morris, who lives in a luxury apartment overlooking the hustling area.  He is attracted to Jan more than just sexually, but sees in him the possibility of a protege for his secret work as an attorney and head of the US branch of an international activist cartel.  He \\"grooms\\" Jan, helping him through an exploration of his sexuality, making him into the perfect boytoy for his needs, but also teaching him manners and about culture, areas in which the small town boy was lacking.  With the help of his able assistant/bodyguard, Han, Tim buys a pledge of non-interference from Jan's mother, after which Tim and Jan embark on a dangerous journey to Europe.  Over time, the reader sees their relationship develop, from one based on opportunity and desperation, to one of mutual trust, love, and purpose.<br />Very original, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.	2004-05-01

Her lesbian lover, Dag, is a carnival worker (her nickname comes from experience as a sword swallower) who was abused by her father as a little girl, and is somewhat codependent on Patrice.  Their best friend, and Zach's primary male role model, is Joshua, a gay neighbor who owns a video store.  Other characters include a blind store owner who gives young Zach a job, a drunk who gets Zach interested in the theatre, and a hispanic gay hustler who befriends Zach in a time of need.<br />I was extremely impressed with the vivid, realistic \\"warts and all\\" characterizations in this novel, which made the novel seem like a visit with people you'd like to have known.  The book would be appropriate for young as well as older, open-minded readers.  I recommend it highly.	2004-02-28

So it is not so strange when his coworkers at Lillys (a restaurant owned by a former movie star) bet him $50 he can't seduce a young Mormon missionary who recently moved in (along with three other missionaries) into his apartment complex.  Along the way, Christian falls in love with the shy, frustrated Aaron Davis, who also finds himself attracted to Christian, in contrary to his strong religious upbringing and beliefs.  He also makes Christian realize something about himself, and the story becomes a compelling story of connection and self-discovery as well as romance.  It also realistically depicts the plight of gay members of the LDS church, as Aaron is discovered by a roommate and sent home from his mission in disgrace.<br />The novel is based on a screenplay for the film, which has recently been released in several major US cities, and broke all records for gay movies in its opening weekend.  I have not seen the film, so my review is based solely on the book.  Nor has the book spoiled me from wanting to see the film, since the story - while somewhat simplistic and predictable in its revelations - is told masterfully and sensitively.  I'd rate the book 5 stars out of 5, and look forward to the DVD release of the film.	2004-02-16

The title of this compilation of four \\"mini-novels\\" is apt, as they revolve around various fantasies gay men might have about their \\"dream\\" man.  The four stories are by authors well known in the field of gay fiction.<br />My personal favorite in the collection is \\"Sex and the Single Rock Star\\" by Jon Jeffrey.  We meet freelance journalist Grant Browder, recoiling from a break-up with his boyfriend, who gets his dream assignment to write about Ronan, a bisexual Irish rock-star with a reputation for sex, drugs and heavy partying.  As you might guess, much of the interview is conducted in bed, and Grant wonders if he can keep pace with rock's bad party-boy.  The story also includes some rather colorful additional characters.<br />\\"Out of Bounds\\" by Dave Benbow visits the standard fantasy of a nerdy (didn't know it yet but was) gay high school student having a crush on the school's football star, taking it into the next decade when the not-so-nerdy-anymore Wade is a successful realtor.  The now-NFL star, Colton Jennings, supposedly looks up Wade for some advice on buying a house, but it soon becomes clear that the feelings that Wade had for Colton in their youth were more than mutual, a revelation that Colton now feels ready to deal with.  Very realistic depiction of the problems facing gay pro athletes, in an engaging sweet story.<br />In Ben Tyler's \\"Spanish Eyes\\", out-of-work Brad decides to bum around Europe a while and see if he can find his dream love.  He is aided at first by a somewhat unusual matchmaker, than sets off on his own to Seville to look for someone whom he can imagine spending the rest of his life with.<br />Last but not least, Sean Wolfe's \\"Bad Boy Dreams\\" explores the common fantasy of a gay man being attracted to older men, in this case Enrique has the hots for the divorced father of his college roommmate, with whom he ends up driving cross country.  Interleaved with flashback passages (in italics, but still a bit distracting from the flow of the story) relating his feelings to his childhood growing up with his grandmother as surrogate caregiver, the story suggests the reasons for his attaction to older men, as well as the role parents and guardians may have in guiding a young man in later life.<br />A quick beach or airplane read you will enjoy.he story) relating his feelings to his childhood growing up with his grandmother as surrogate caregiver, the story suggests the reasons for his attaction to older men, as well as the role parents and guardians may have in guiding a young man in later life.  <br />A quick beach or airplane read you will enjoy.	2004-02-10

He finds out he is positive, and resolves to make the most out of what he assumes will be the final years of his life.  Then the miracle of protease inhibitors becomes a reality, and Dennis (and his best friend/traveling companion Jimmy, who is also positive) gets into a trial program in which he is one of the lucky ones, finding a drug combination that restores his t-cells and makes his viral count undertectable.  What he thought would be the end of his life turns out to be the start of a new life he wasn't expecting or prepared for.<br />At the same time, he made a promise to God to become a priest, if allowed to live.  Dennis makes good on his promise, studying to be one of the Jesuit priests he is assigned to assist.  Unfortunately, feelings from his \\"old\\" life make this new one tough to deal with, and Dennis has to consider if this is indeed the calling for him.<br />Set primarily in the San Francisco area during the technology boom of the early-mid 1990's, \\"The Boom Economy, Or Scenes from Clerical Life\\" covers a decade in the life of a man who alternately feels grateful and cheated, and his colorful friends and acquaintances through which he tries to put his own life in better perspective.  Seems realistic to me, as I have several acquaintances who expressed the same kind of frustrated emotions at assuming the end of their life was near, only to be given a new chance thanks to the antiviral drugs, but still realizing the fix could just be temporary.  The religious and spiritual dilemma of such frustrations is a great deal of what this novel is about, and would be of primary interest to those who know others in such situations.	2004-01-01
US	44359438	R2NDFIPQSUGT2B	0595658911	780270976	The Rules of Temptation: A Novel	Books	3	0	1	N	Y	Very dark novel will get you emotionally involved	Set in his home city of Phoenix, the author's first novel is an extremely dark and disturbing narrative about four men:  a gay yuppie who is having relationship problems and chances a brief affair with another, the participant in that affair who (upon rejection) tries to shelter himself from future rejection by getting into alcohol and drugs as well as promiscuous sex and S&M, a young runaway who sees prostition as his road to a better life, and a mentally disturbed and dellusional Gulf War veteran who believes he is being spied upon and hunted.  The story is narrated by each character alternately in each chapter.  The author skillfully develops each character so the reader begins to like and somewhat empathize with him, which sets up the reader for an emotional rollercoaster ride when the character turns dangerously to his \\"dark side\\".<br />I am aware that I-Universe does not edit an author's work once submitted.  Still, I don't recall ever reading a novel with as many typographical errors, most likely the result of selecting the wrong word from those suggested by a \\"spell checker\\" program (For example, an irritated patch of skin on one character leaves him with a \\"SINGING sensation\\" when touched.  There are also several places where \\"and\\" is used instead of \\"an\\", and adjective/verb forms of words misused.)  The continuity also is lacking, with one character at a bar he says is \\"two blocks\\" from his home, only to have to drive \\"three miles\\" to get there on the very next page.  Last and least, but worth mentioning, is that the author interjects at least a half dozen distracting passages that seem to ramble on about the geographical makeup of Phoenix (which is my home as well), and seems obsessed with our late summer \\"monsoon\\" rainstorms, a rare occurance since Phoenix actually averages 350 sunny days a year.<br />Overall, I'd recommend the book for those who enjoy \\"dark\\" stories about the \\"gay underground,\\" hustler culture, S&M clubs, etc.  The author shows some promise for the future, but I'd have to limit my rating on this one to 3 stars out of 5.promise for the future, but I'd have to limit my rating on this one to 3 stars out of 5.	2003-10-25

The four stories (averaging about 75 pages each) are set during the holiday season, in accordance with the title.<br />In the opener, Jon (\\"Boyfriend Material\\") Jeffrey features his character Carson St. John, who is the wickedly-biting editor of a gay mens magazine.  Carson is offered a better job on a famous men's magazine, with the added bonus that he'll be working with a charming, very handsome (and single) Brit who expressed an interest in him.  Loaded with catty criticism of the NYC \\"A list\\" gay community.<br />Chris (\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", \\"Uncle Max\\") Kenry has a cute story with an interesting twist:  Frank Malloy is a well-known photographer, best known for his \\"coffee table\\" books of male nudes, primarily young smooth twinks, surfers, etc.  He is regularly approached by cute young men looking to model for him, but the irony is that Frank is only attracted to chubby men ... like the UPS man Al, who Frank keeps coming to his door daily by ordering things through mail order he really doesn't want or need.  Frank also meets up with a Czech former porn star, who wants to be Frank's apprentice, but Al thinks Frank is having an affair with.<br />My favorite of the four is by William J (\\"The Men From The Boys\\", \\"Where The Boys Are\\") Mann, who explores the emotional dynamics between four diverse gay 20-something men who have been friends since their early teens.  At the age when they start to favor \\"settling down\\", they struggle with relationships as well as each other's perceptions of their chosen boyfriends.<br />Last but not least, Ben (\\"Gay Blades\\", \\"Hunk House\\", \\"Tricks of the Trade\\") Tyler brings us a fun look at the home of an aging, overbearing rich Hollywood icon, Polly Pepper, and her gay son, Tim, who functions more like her personal assistant.  Tim realizes Mom holds the pursestrings, and is generally happy with his status as \\"Polly Pepper's gay son\\", except that he resents that any guys he meets seem to be more excited about having access to Polly than to him.lly Pepper's gay son\\", except that he resents that any guys he meets seem to be more excited about having access to Polly than to him.	2003-10-10

Now in his mid-40's, HIV+ and single since his boyfriend moved out of the country, the Benjamin Justice we find here seems<br />significantly subdued from the fiery, brash investigative journalist we met in Wilson's first four books in the series, which started a dozen years earlier.  Back then, Justice had managed to short-circuit a promising journalism career by fabricating some interviews for a story which won a Pulitzer Prize, and was caught.  Writing assignments had been few and far between since then.  In the past five years, Benjamin had not worked, living simply and frugally, but recently got an advance to write his biography, which gives him some apprehensions about reliving part of his past he'd rather not revisit.  His only current link to his former profession is his best friend Alexandra Templeton, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, who is secretly engaged to columnist Joe Soto, a longtime friend as well.<br />In making notes on his biography, Justice faces his long-buried<br />feelings about having been molested at ages 12-13 by a parish priest back in Buffalo NY.  To bring closure to that episode in his life, he seeks out information about the priest, and learns that he actually had been transferred to the Los Angeles archdiocese a few years after his encounters, and died in a reported hiking accident about ten years ago.  Justice presses the local diocese officials for more information, whether there had been further reports of molestations or if he had indeed been &quot;rehabilitated,&quot; and is surprised when the &quot;sorry, that's confidential&quot; response comes from the office of the Bishop himself.  Justice smells a coverup, and talks his friend Joe Soto into doing a column about an &quot;anonymous&quot; reader who reported abuse by the priest, and the strange reaction<br />received from the diocese.<br />The mystery quickly grows from there, as Joe Soto is killed in a suspicious hit-and-run accident, with some evidence suggesting that the driver may have been an infamous South American hired assassin, who usually works for drug cartels.  At the same time, reaction to Soto's column triggers letters from readers with additional reports of mollestations by the priest, creating more questions than answers, especially when one such reader mysteriously dies in a fall from the hospital where she worked.  When the diocese offers him a million dollars to end his investigations, Justice becomes more<br />assured that the bishop (which had been a close friend of the priest in question) may be involved, and perhaps even the presiding Cardinal, who is under strong consideration to be the next pope.<br />Absolute nail-biting suspense, with passages of outright terror, make this, in my opinion, the best of the series.  Realistic, street-saavy characters and scenarios, with an eye for detail that makes him one of the best.he driver may have been an infamous South American hired assassin, who usually works for drug cartels.

US	44359438	R2EQJGDOPR7RLI	0595288235	232817145	Finding Peace: A NOVEL	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Excellent "feel good" read with realistic characters	\\"Finding Peace\\" is Barriger's second novel, and sequel to last year's \\"Finding Faith.\\"  It picks up two years after the first novel, which detailed the rocky courtship of Taylor (big city attorney who relocated to this small town following the end of a longtime relationship) and Tom (local boy who works as a baker while studying to become a high school teacher).  When we rejoin the couple and their friends, Taylor's local law partnership is starting to florish, while Tom still works part time at the bakery while teaching school.  The couple take a generous offer to buy the bakery from the current owner, and advertise for help to minimize their time needed in the business.  This brings into their lives an 18 year old gay high school student, Wayne, who came from a physically abusive home, with Tom and Taylor taking him in their homes as  surrogate guardians/role models.  This comes right before a whirlwind Thanksgiving holiday, not just the busiest time of the year for the bakery, but also the planned meeting of both Tom's and Taylor's families for the first time.<br />The presence of Taylor's married brother at the holiday awakens a regret on his part that our laws do not recognize same-sex marriages, leaving it to each couple to convince their families and others of the legitimacy of their relationship.  Taylor's frustration is not so much on the legal protections marriage offers (which, to some extent, can be duplicated through legal documentation, wills, etc.) but something as simple as terminology, as he refers to \\"my Tom\\" in lieu of terms such as \\"partner\\" or \\"lover\\" which seem to trivialize the relationship.  The couple consider a \\"marriage\\" ceremony for the benefit of their families and friends, as well as the possibility of starting a family, an event that later becomes an unexpected reality.<br />All of their friends from the first novel are back, and Barriger's rich characterizations are the best part of the book.  I personally am a sucker for \\"inclusive\\" novels that show gay and straight characters interacting in ideal but realistic situations, and this novel scores considerable extra points with me on perfecting that concept; it makes you ready to pack up and go househunting in this small town!  While it would be preferabke to have read Barriger's first novel, \\"Finding Faith\\", first, enough background information is given to make that not essential to enjoyment of this sequel.<br />I rate \\"Finding Peace\\" a magnificent 5 out of 5 stars, and wait expectantly for his announced third novel.\\" novels that show gay and straight characters interacting in ideal but realistic situations, and this novel scores considerable extra points with me on perfecting that concept; it makes you ready to pack up and go househunting in this small town!

King is a creative writing major, works as a switchboard operator on campus, and depressed over a rough ending of his first love.  He meets Sam, a kind of poster boy for gay  activism, and through him got involved in the Boulder Gay Liberation Front.  The pregnant, former girlfriend of a past roommate enters his life, and Jen becomes a confidant and surrogate sister, especially after King's mother befriends her after learning her own parents disowned her.  They become neighbors when they both rent studios in a building owned by Theo, another activist.<br />Like the first two books, \\"The Way Things Out To Be\\" is character driven, and Hinton's skilled, almost lyrical writing makes you quickly and naturally familiar with each new character, their hopes and dreams and ... going back to the title ... what they think should be different in their lives.  King's problem, which his friends bring to his attention, is that he is too sensitive for an gay man in the free-sex days of the 1970's, and he frightens away guys by professing love to them almost on the first date.  He tries to get \\"with it\\" more, by going out to the bars in Denver (there were no gay bars in Boulder, apparently) as well as a soon-regretted foray to a gay bathhouse.  He also meets two older men, one (Matthew) a married attorney who professes his love to King, and another (Robert) the bisexual fiance' of his favorite professor.  The novel takes the characters through the a one year period filled with constant surprises, both good and bad ... ranging from encounters with bohemian poet Allen Ginsberg, a gay marriage, death of a two characters, an affair with the college quarterback, confrontations with ex lovers, a gay rape, as well as uncertainty about their futures.<br />It was a little jarring to read a \\"new\\" novel dealing with gay male sex that contained no reference to AIDS or safe-sex, which makes sense since the period (late 1970's) was before the discovery of the disease.  Perhaps that was the author's intention for the setting, a time of somewhat innocence and sexual freedom, or perhaps he was just nostalgic for the era for other reasons.  In any case, it is a delightful, interesting read, and I recommend it highly ... whether you remember the 1970's, or whether you are too young to do so.nd bad ... ranging from encounters with bohemian poet Allen Ginsberg, a gay marriage, death of a two characters, an affair with the college quarterback, confrontations with ex lovers, a gay rape, as well as uncertainty about their futures.<br />It was a little jarring to read a \\"new\\" novel dealing with gay male sex that contained no reference to AIDS or safe-sex, which makes sense since the period (late 1970's) was before the discovery of the disease.

It tells the story from the perspective of Clay Beasley, an openly gay actor who has a small part on the show, auditions for a national \\"Dr. Pepper\\" commercial, and generally waiting for his \\"big break\\" to come.  His best friend / \\"fag hag\\" is Cissi Stanton, who comforted him when his last boyfriend left him for a 20-year old Starbucks clerk, and works as a production assistant on \\"Sunset Cove.\\"  What he has not confided in Cissi is that he recently started a sizzling affair with cast member Travis Church, a closeted featured player whose star is definitely rising and every woman (including Cissi) is lusting over.<br />And the book includes an excellent mystery plotline.  When another actor dies in a prop-rigging accident, then another actor is mysteriously killed in a drive-by shooting, the cast and crew wonders if there is a killer among them, and whom the next target might be.  Parker, the detective assigned to the case begins an affair with Drusilla Gordon, a network executive, and the couple spot Clay and Travis out on a date, which - along with other factors - makes Travis one of the main suspects in the murders.  Lots of surprises in this one.<br />With a combination of the world of daytime soaps and a few sterotypical WeHo gay gymbot characters, this book may not be everyone's cup of tea.  But I enjoyed it, and recommend it for those who can get into such stories.	2003-06-04

An ambitious sequel of sorts to his 1997 novel \\"The Men From The Boys\\", Mann's new novel can likeiwse be considered a \\"coming of age\\" story, this time of a group of gay men becoming disillusioned with the \\"circuit party\\" life and looking to settle down.  Having not read the original should not deter readers from this one (I hardly remember the first book, and it didn't matter.)<br />The story alternates narration by three main characters, including 30-something Jeff and Lloyd from the first book, who are no longer a couple and have tried to reinvent their lives with money inherited by their former mentor/lover Javitz.  Jeff has become a regular at \\"circuit\\" parties, and takes in a 29 year old hunk who seems surprisingly naive about gay life. The nore conservative Lloyd is in the process of opening a bed-and-breakfast inn in Provincetown along with a widowed woman around his age who seems to enjoy the company of gay men.  But Jeff and Lloyd are still in love, and bond somewhat in trying to uncover the mysterious pasts of their new partners.  The third narrator is Henry, a formerly-nebbish younger man to whom Jeff has become sort of a mentor, and under whose encouragement has morphed into a gym bunny who gets off on the attention his new body commands, and decides to moonlight as a male escort.<br />This lengthy (426 page) book is fleshed out with colorful additional characters (gay, lesbian and straight), stuffed with campy references, catty remarks, circuit happenings, accurate commentary on the changing attitudes concerning AIDS, and references to recent events.  Thought provoking, entertaining and original, very satisfying reading.	2003-05-17

When we last left Claire Gray (at the end of Craft's \\"Desert Autumm\\" mystery), the transplanted NYC Broadway producer was settled in her new home near Palm Springs CA, heading the Drama department at the new Desert Arts College built by multimillionaire D. Glenn Yeats.  Along the way, she had helped Larry, the straight police detective brother of her gay neighbor/friend Grant Kane, solve a murder, and picked up a boyfriend who was less than half of her (54) age.<br />In the new book, Claire accompanies Grant to the home of wealthy retired designer/recluse Stewart Chaffee, a feisty senior who lives with his former lover, Makepeace (call him \\"Pea\\" for short ... which he is) and has daily visits from his private duty nurse, the feisty Bonnie, and his banker Meridith, who - since Stewart hates attorneys - is helping him document how his substantial estate is to be administered.  Claire returns a few days later to pick up an antique clock (a prop for a play being staged at the college) and finds Stewart dead, crushed under the kitchen refrigerator, which he likely visited to get to a favorite sweet treat.  Having discovered the body, Claire is quick to get involved in the \\"whodunit\\" aspect of the murder, and Larry Kane knows better than to try to dissuade her from helping him.<br />This is very much an upbeat, fun read, which the author skillfully maintains by keeping potentially hillarious (except for the fact they involve a murder) situations in good taste. As an aside, the book also seems to realistically but favorably comment on the prognosis of \\"May-December\\" romances (one partner considerably older than the other), which describes not just Claire and the hunky Tanner, but also Grant and his young partner Kane.  Last but not least, the book features a welcome cameo by Mark Manning, the author's Wisconsin newspaperman/amateur sleuth, who is visiting his nephew Thad, one of Claire's students.  Mark indeed provides a valuable insight that helps the investigation avoid a serious problem.<br />OK, I'll admit it ... I'm addicted to both the Mark Manning and - now - Claire Gray series of mysteries.  The relatively light tone, perfect pacing of developments, attention to detail, colorful yet believeable characterizations and intelligent writing styles are among the best I have seen.  My only concern, in seeing the progression in the titles of the new series (Desert Autum, now Desert Winter) is that the desert will run out of seasons before I run out of interest in the series! :)oid a serious problem.  <br />OK, I'll admit it ...

Greg Fine is a 56 year old gay, Jewish advertising copy writer who lives alone (except for his feisty 17 year old male cat, Rolf) - and likes it that way - in New York City.  But a well-meaning cousin is concerned about Greg's pattern of backroom sex and seeming inability - even as he enters his senior years - to commit to a man (or woman) for anything more (such as a second date, let alone taking on a live-in lover), and talks him into joining an existing group therapy session on Monday evenings.<br />Greg agrees with some reservations, most related to the fact that he is the only gay person among the three women and other man already in the group. His personality immediately conflicts with the \\"structure\\" of the group, the fact that the psychologist who is present in the group (and decides when the group will meet and what weeks it will take off, and bills all enrolled even if they skip a week) rarely gives any input into the group dynamics, the fact that group participants are forbidden to meet socially outside of the group (not that he would want to, since his first few meetings with them are borderline antagonistic, but he resents the fact that he can't anyway.) and the weekly battle among the participants for \\"time\\" to talk about their own problems, which bring out attacks from the others that they are \\"monopolizing\\" the group.  He relates his basic history, his attraction to mostly younger men (including one trainer at his health club he has a crush on) and his history of brief, anonymous \\"backroom\\" sexual encounters, which the rest of the group obviously cannot relate to.  But as the next seven months unfold, Greg becomes more intergrated into the group, giving and receiving valuable insight, somewhat paving the way for a later addition, who is openly lesbian.  In the interim, he works on things he decides he wants to change in his life, reconciling with his estranged father (who had several small strokes and isn't well), finishing up a play about an older and younger gay man, and quits smoking.  His best friend Norman, not a fan of the group, helps him get a reading of his play, through which Greg meets a single gay man his own age as well as gets closer to Frank, the young trainer at his health club (and coach in the non-smoking program he joined) who turns out to be an amateur actor.  In time, Greg concludes his time in the group, not really sure if it helped him directly, but realizing the time frame has allowed him to become more attuned to what he wants out of life.<br />The novel is written with dry humor and wit, and will be especially appreciated by cat lovers (One of the chapters is from the perspective of Greg's cat).  The fact that the author and several other characters are Jewish is not really relevant to the book, and should not deter someone who may think the book is \\"too ethnic\\" in that context.

In time, Greg concludes his time in the group, not really sure if it helped him directly, but realizing the time frame has allowed him to become more attuned to what he wants out of life.<br />The novel is written with dry humor and wit, and will be especially appreciated by cat lovers (One of the chapters is from the perspective of Greg's cat).  The fact that the author and several other characters are Jewish is not really relevant to the book, and should not deter someone who may think the book is \\"too ethnic\\" in that context.

US	44359438	R2Q7KY0ABKHRMQ	0595245722	576138427	Come Clean	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Original, suspenseful and terrifying ...	As an avid reader of the works of the top gay mystery writers, starting this book had me scratching my head with confusion, since I wasn't sure where the author's biography left off and the fiction began, if at all.  For someone who is used to dealing with Michael Nava \\"Henry Rios\\" or Mark Zubro's \\"Paul Turner\\" character, this was confusing. You see, the name of the first time author is Kevin J. Porter, who says he is a 65 year old Vancouver-based private investigator and ex chief inspector in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and that is also the name and bio of the main character and narrator of the novel.  One really doesn't know if this is based on actual cases or pure fantasy, especially where the line further blurs, such as when the narrator (Kevin J Porter) explains the reasons for leaving the RCMP and - at the end - plans to publish his first book.<br />That initial confusion aside, the book is one of the most original, suspenseful and outright *terrifying* mystery novels I have ever read.  The author is skilled at feeding the reader carefully-timed tidbits of information, before they become evident to those trying to solve the case, making the reader feel smart and leading to \\"obvious\\" conclusions.  Unfortunately, what seems obvious in the last chapter is proved to be impossible in the next, and one is left frustrated and doubting how this will all be tied together somehow, but it is, masterfully.<br />In a nutshell, Kevin Porter discovers a murder scene, after his boyfriend Brent (about half of Kevin's age; Kevin is Brent's \\"senior toy\\") asks him to check on a university colleague who did not return from her weekend retreat for her Monday morning classes. The unique \\"clean fettish\\" of the killer also serves to erase all of the usual sources of evidence, frustrating the RCMP investigator (a former subordinate of Porter's) who is assigned to the case.  The chapters alternate between the Porter's and the killer's perspectives, and we learn early on (Note:  NOT a spoiler, as this is within the first two chapters) that the killer works as a make-up artist on the Vancouver-based filming of the \\"X-Files\\" TV show.  A series of complicated incidents result in Porter's being \\"outed\\" to his former RCMP colleagues, and his lover Brent becoming a suspect in the murder, two developments that are handled quite realistically.  The investigation goes on while Vancouver police are also investigating the latest in a series of gay-bashing murders in a public park, and readers learn there is a connection before the investigators do.  The tale is not for the squeemish, and a comparison of the murderer to Hannibal Lector isn't far fetched.  I recommend it highly.NOT a spoiler, as this is within the first two chapters) that the killer works as a make-up artist on the Vancouver-based filming of the \\"X-Files\\" TV show.

US	44359438	R3RQ5QD9XBRTCL	0758201729	585649380	Desperate Hearts	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Contemporary fiction with a message	The Publisher's Weekly review pretty much nailed the shortfalls of this sequel to the author's \\"Cathedral City.\\"  The concurrent scenarios become confusing at times, and some of them border on soap-opera kitsch.  The book is also more of a continuation of the original novel, rather than a sequel, and would make no sense whatsoever without a knowledge of the first story (which the author provides, in lengthy flashbacks, disrupting the flow of the novel for new readers and boring the heck out of those who read the first one.)  It does provide a measure of \\"closure\\" for those who didn't like the loose ends left at the end of Cathedral City.<br />But, despite its flaws, Desperate Hearts is a riveting, compelling tale of the political and social issues facing the desert town of Cathedral City, through the eyes of diverse  Latino and Anglo characters, both gay and straight.  They have dreams and pasts, but largely are trying to get by at a time when the city fathers as well as a local parish priest can't seem to choose between the city's ethnic past and a promise that it could take on more of the weathy trappings of its neighboring city, Palm Springs. A significant part of the story concerns the reality of US policies concerning immigration from Mexico, and a new, pivotal character introduced is a US Border Patrol agent who has an affair with local Pablo.  The book also somewhat takes on the Catholic church's occasional loss of focus when money is dangled before it, in a realistic telling that should be required reading for pastors.  The ending provides \\"happily ever after\\" scenarios for each character, which seems like the author's reaction to the criticisms of the earlier book.	2002-11-18
US	44359438	R3TZTXQHOZ1W0G	1930928688	708759433	Bleeding Hearts	Books	4	1	4	N	Y	Captivating, but a bit overdone in parts	I agree with previous reviews that the book is an engrossing mystery with believeable characters that many gay teens can identify with. The basic plot, the killing of a gay student which the police are writing off as a foiled robbery rather than a hate crime, is one that is developed well.  And the \\"who done it\\" is unlikely to be guessed by many.<br />The only criticisms I have is that the author goes a bit overboard in some respects, such as surrounding Killian with new acquaintances who first decide they are gay after spending a few minutes talking with him.  Also, the descriptions get to be a bit hard to take in parts (like \\"We walked across the emerald green grass, daffodils waved their cheery heards, and robbins hopped out of our way...\\")	2002-11-14
US	44359438	R316R3LDXIYHHV	1555837638	428025231	Different People: A Novel	Books	3	1	2	N	Y	Interesting, frustrating, enlightening and sometimes boring.	The Publisher's Weekly reviewer pretty much &quot;nailed it&quot; for the most part, including his assessment of the characters and their actions.<br />In a nutshell, this is a very wordy, often interesting, often frustrating, sometimes comforting and challenging story of two neighbors, whom we meet in their early 20's and follow through to their mid 30's.  You read about the experiences they shared, their dreams, unexpected life experiences, and what in their lives seemed destined to keep them apart, although fate often intervened. It gives you an idea how our upbringing - even if we disagree with the basic concepts - can affect our future attitudes and lives, both good and bad.<br />In my opinion, the overriding morale here is that one should keep lines of communication open, and not let your fatalistic intuition tell you that a potential relationship just &quot;won't work,&quot; when your heart is telling you otherwise.  It's a lesson that the two men never seem to learn, to the very last page.	2002-11-01
US	44359438	R2CYLRJI4T82UH	1931875014	365900432	Devil Inside, The Suspense Thriller, The	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	May disturb some readers	A well-developed, involved mystery-suspense novel, with some sci-fi overtones, featuring fleshed-out, racially diverse, realistic characters most gay, lesbian or bisexual readers will be able to identify with.  But if you prefer a healthy dose of PC with your reading, better pass on this one.<br />The novel does not hesitate to point out, even in the first chapter, some basic problems facing gay male society, including those pushed on us by others as well as those for which we can only blame ourselves.  But it \\"goes where no gay novel has gone before\\", by (cleverly, in stages) blurring the line between homosexuality and pedophilia, a distincting that gay activists have spent considerable efforts in reinforcing.  The fact that the accusation of gay-men-as-child-mollestors comes from misguided right-wing forces can easily be dismissed, but even the gay characters have occasional lapses of faith in the distinction.<br />All in all, a disturbing but absolutely riviting novel, which I recommend to those who can read it with an open mind.	2002-08-11

The annual \\"Best of the Superstars\\" series has been a mainstay of John Patrick and his StarBooksPress, providing a review of male idols and stars in TV, legit film, print ads and porn. And this 2002 is no different, with an excellent review of \\"who is gay\\" gossip for the year, the sexy stars of \\"Queer As Folk\\", those so-sexy A&F models, as well as trends in gay porn on video, DVD and the internet.  It includes a directory of gay escort and other porn website URLs.<br />What sets this edition apart is that it was the last effort of John Patrick (author/editor of hundreds of gay porn books, anthologies and short stories) before his death, which could cause this to become a bit of a collector's item in the near future.  Unlike most of StarBooksPress output, this annual series is never reprinted, meaning there is a limited number of copies available out there.  Definitely a \\"keeper.\\"	2002-08-06

The normal development from that could not help but make for an entertaining and enjoyable book.<br />But the author goes too far ... including distracting side stories about a down-on-his-luck sports writer, religious leaders' takes on homosexuality, and a cheesey local cable TV operator who makes his daughter the team's TV commentator in order to keep her busy.  I wasn't expecting (nor did I desire) any \\"PC\\" approach to gays, but the author ran with the classic stereotypes to the point where many of the non-gay characters are laughably clueless ... A lot less would have been a lot more, in my opinion.	2002-08-02
