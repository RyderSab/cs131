Gaines examines the relationships between property and personality that have developed over the years at the beachfront, from building castles to accumulating mass amounts of acreage where parties can be thrown and paparazzi shots can be taken. Philistines at the Hedgerow provides yet another glimpse into the celebrity backdrop of American life in an area that has radically altered itself over time from simple farmland to idyllic playground.	2005-10-13

The author compresses these years into a 24-hour period (divided into one chapter for every hour) and places the events at a fictitious Hotel Babylon (to protect the guilty who may include the author).<br /><br />This book is nonstop fun as the narrator divulges all the dirty little details of the hospitality business. I would recommend to anyone- anyone not too squeamish or prudish that is!  Also has a new book about the airline industry called Air Babylon.	2005-10-13

The patterns, you'd think, would be fairly simple since they're only common items like scarves and mittens.  I've been knitting for quite a few years and I had a hard time reading the patterns.  I felt like I was looking at a math book, not a knitting patterns.  I even showed this book to my mom who has been knitting for over 30 years and she said she wouldn't attempt these patterns the way they were written out.  If I was a new knitter looking for a pattern I would be instantly turned off of knitting if I saw this book.  Way too complicated.	2005-10-10

John Fairchild is the charismatic and outspoken publisher of two of the fashion industry's most influential magazines: Women's Wear Daily and W.

Nonetheless, this book is a great read and hilarious. Reichl talks about moving from being the restaraunt critic for the LA Times to the NY Times. It is great to read about how she dresses up and goes undercover to see how regular, non-rich people get treated at restaraunts. Great stories and pleasant to read beacuse Reichl has the gift of sounding like your friend and that she is right there telling you what happened to her today.	2005-10-10

This one seemed to take forever.  The story starts off fine.  A body is found in the attic of a fabulous Long Island estate. There is a claw print scorched into the wall, and the stench of sulphur chokes the air.  With a beginning like that, you'd think it would be a great book, but it seemed to drag on forever.  I think that Preston and Child were trying to write an epic story, but the excesses of the story turned it into an epic bore. This could have been a more interesting book if it had been shorter and less epic in its sweep. A surfeit of good things bores me, and that is what Preston and Child did in this book. It can't hold a candle to The Cabinet of Curiosities.	2005-10-08

None of those adjectives define this book. First of all, the mechanism which drives the final plot twists is so very easy to figure out very early in the book.  So, there's no surprising denoument in the end. This story is 538 pages in the hardcover edition (not including his Afterword). Easily a hundred of these pages, and probably more, should have been edited out of this book. I found myself skimming pages at a time as I was looking for the story to pick back up again after wading through the interminable (and boring) angst of the two lead characters plumbing their relationship in excruciatingly mind-numbing and repetitive detail. And every plot twist is depicted repetitively as each of three or four characters try to deduce the nature of the goings-on at a hospital stalked by a serial killer. In all honesty, I was barely able to finish this book. It was more out of curiousity about whether I'd correctly predicted the ending - which I had. It's almost literally a no-brainer. I simply can't recommend this one.	2005-10-08

Buying real estate in Manhattan is like buying real estate nowhere else in the world: a hoity-toity book called the Social Register dictates who can live where; co-op boards in luxury buildings often require a buyer to have at least 20 times the price of the apartment in assets; and the cost of an apartment rarely holds any relationship to the true value of the space. Indeed, Manhattan real estate is a cutthroat, baffling but thrilling world, and Gaines takes readers on a spectacular ride through it. Real estate done by the social register, Gaines implies, may be a thing of the past. His last chapter focuses on a new breed of Manhattan brokers, those who are solely interested in racking up sales. A gossipy, entertaining peek into a glam world.	2005-10-04

I love to look at knitting patterns and wish I could knit more than just a scarf.  This book has been a great help so far.  I'm comfortable with the common \\"knit & purl\\" techniques but anything after that, I get a little intimidated.  This book breaks it down and shows you, with illustrations, just how to make those tricky stitches.  With other patterns I've seen they have a difficulty scale and that's my only complaint with this book.  I'd like to knit a few of the sweaters in the book but I don't know if I'd be way over my head or not.  Other than that, I think it's a great book for anyone who is interested in learning to knit or even current knitters looking for some new, funky patterns.  It would make a great gift!	2005-09-18

To be honest, I didn't really enjoy this one all that much.  It has been over two years since she wrote her last one so it was difficult to remember just what happened in the previous book.  After waiting so long for the latest book, it finally came and I started reading it with much anticipation.

I couldn't have been more wrong.  You have to be really advanced to use this book.  First you need to know how to do all of the postures properly.  Then you have to read how to incorporate the weights and I don't mean a short instruction sentence.  These people write a few paragraphs that explain how to do the specific posture with weights.  That's just one posture.

Yet the book reads like a haphazardly scribbled diary-the text, at best, yielding a few thought-provoking hypotheses, a few keen observations, and loads of conjecture.  As a real-life extension of a MIT master's thesis, Brende and his wife Mary relocate to a remote, undisclosed location outside of Lancaster County, PA. Here they rent a small farmhouse and garden from the Millers, a strict neo-Mennonite family. Brende's expectations for this rural \\"expedition\\" as he calls it, seem to constantly shift in the face of this borrowed life as a modern-day vassal.<br /><br />Overall, the Brendes' experiment finds very limited success. They do finally manage to achieve a livable happy medium between abject deprivation and total subservience to technology. Unfortunately, however, one senses the book becoming more of a lame apologia for the moderate use of technology, rather than emphasizing the merits of \\"flipping the switch\\" on all things electric. And it wouldn't be completely unfair to conclude that the Brendes' life on the Minimite farm ends up being the very \\"test of endurance\\" they once feared.	2005-06-11

With a story like that, you'd think it would be a fast paced, thrilling read.  I was wrong.  I couldn't wait to read Michael Palmer's new book but was so disappointed when I got it.  It's such a slow read for the first 150 pages.  His attempts to make the minor characters stand out are overdone and intrusive.  By the time the book started getting good, it was nearly over.

I was disappointed with a lot of his advice.  He referred to a lot of other author's ideas as 'absurd advice'.  He thought it was absurd for women to scale back their wardrobe to just a few items.  For me, I think it makes perfect sense no matter what type of job you have.  Have you seen a man's closet?  They can get away with it... yet he thinks women can't.<br /><br />Even something as simple as choosing to not make the bed he thinks is silly.  If not making your bed will make things simpler for you, then don't.  It's a personal choice and for some people it can be a stressful thing.

Just as I was leaving the library I happened to see her name on a bright red book and immediately picked it up.  I think I had half of the book read by the time I got home.  (It's not a long book, by any means)<br /><br />Whether undergoing Botox or living under burkhas, women of all cultures and backgrounds feel compelled to change the way they look in order to fit in with their particular culture. In The Good Body, Ensler explores Bombay to Beverly Hills. Delivering narratives collected in locker rooms, cell blocks, boardrooms, and bedrooms, Ensler frames their stories with her own personal journey from a self-loathing teenager to a (sometimes) self-accepting adult.<br /><br />Some of the monologues in The Good Body are based on well-known women like Helen Gurley Brown who, at the age of 80, still does two hundred situps a day.  Those monologues, which grew out of a series of conversations with each of these fascinating women, are not recorded interviews, but interpretations of the lives they offered me. Some of the other characters are based on real lives, real stories. Many are invented.<br /><br />By the end of the book I feel empowered.  I feel as if I don't need to continue this way of living where I constantly feel fat.  Then I remember I'm living in the real world and unfortunately, size matters.	2005-03-10

Being told she suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder she began to wonder how many other so called disorders have been removed from this new edition and will her disorder still exist 25 years later?

The client, a pharmaceutical company, is charged with falsifying test results on a new drug that appears to cause horrendous birth defects. Daniel is sure the company didn't do it, but among all the documents he overlooks a letter that could destroy his client's defense. The opposing counsel gets hold of it, and the next thing you know, Daniel's smack in the middle of a murder as well as the attendant legal fraud and chicanery. Who else, besides its manufacturer, wants the truth about the drug trials covered up? Whose body, charred almost beyond recognition, was found in the lab along with a score of dead test monkeys? And what's the connection between a double kidnapping and murder that happened years ago in Arizona and the headline-grabbing lawyer that's trying to pin the blame on Daniel's client for the drug's terrible effects.

Jon Dupre, a violent pimp accused of murdering Senator Harold Travis, is a world-class scumbag. The evidence against him looks strong and, while in police custody, he kills his court-appointed attorney.<br /><br />There accordingly isn't a lot of tension for any sort of race against time to find the real killer. On top of that, Travis is an extortionist and a murderer in his own right, so his death is not going to elicit any particular sympathy.  When Jaffe is requested by the court to take over his defense, it looks like an uphill battle for her. When she begins to investigate Dupre's alibi and claims of innocence, however, she is pressured to drop her investigation and let justice take its course. As Jaffe nears the surprising truth, she brings danger closer to herself and those she loves, even as the truth that she and her client is seeking comes from a totally unexpected source.	2004-09-19

The last Nazi who Gale is hunting is the mysterious and elusive Adalwolf. Adalwolf is rumored to be the foster son of The Third Reich's Dr. Josef Mengele, last seen polluting the waters of Chile with his dying breaths. Gale has come close to capturing Adalwolf on numerous occasions, and as THE LAST NAZI opens, she thinks she has him. Remember, however, this is the beginning of the book, not the end.<br />Adalwolf and Gale have been doing a deadly dance for years, and Gale has thought she has had him on numerous occasions, only to have him slip from her grasp. Adalwolf, for his part, has decided that it will be only fitting to utilize Gale as his unwilling, unwitting instrument by which Hitler's goal of the total extermination of the Jewish race will be accomplished. Adalwolf's plan is horrifically ingenious, and has the added effect of raising a moral dilemma. By the time you finish the final page of THE LAST NAZI you will be mentally out of breath, yet wishing that this fine novel had another 300 pages to go.<br />The result is a thriller that ratchets the suspense level up with each rapidly turning page, while simultaneously creating a heartwarming effect that provides an element of hope and beauty in the face of irrational hatred. Pottinger with THE LAST NAZI continues his rapid rise up the 'A' List of thriller writers with this unforgettable, \\"impossible to put down\\" novel.	2004-07-11

The urge to read straight on throught to the end is virtually irresistible.  Robin Cameron is a psychiatrist who has created a device that can heal criminals, by intervening in the area of their brains that deals with old angers and that consequentialy cause their criminal behavior.<br />Her most promising patient is the serial killer Justin Gray, who murders high school girls. As he doesn't torture them, nor abuse them and is an alcoholic as a means to deal with the killings, he's considered one of those who can certainly be healed.<br />There's also a LAPD sergeant called Alan Brand, who confessed having murdered people. When Gray escapes and soon after Robin's daughter is kidnapped, the psychiatrist doesn't know whom to blame for the kidnap and suspects both the cop and the killer.<br />While searching for her daughter she's going to meet the worst of the human nature. There's great suspense through the story and no character can be trusted. All of them were involved in some violent situation. Things get more and more twisted until the surprising end comes.	2004-06-27

I thought this book would be somewhat like The Nanny Diaries, which was a fun book.  This book skewers a certain kind of woman found on the Upper East Side whose only ambition is to preside over benefit dinners, and to have her tiny, shiny-face photograph appear in the party pages of any magazine.<br />Amid this thicket of gossips, snobs and nasties lives Melanie Korn, a former stewardess who's married to &quot;life transition&quot; mogul Arthur Korn. That means he's made tons of money on caskets, funeral homes and retirement homes. But it will take more than Arthur's megamillions for her to succeed in ingratiating herself to the wicked witches of the Upper East Side.<br />The Right Address could have been an amusing, albeit extreme, expose of the lives of the rich. However, the absence of any real human emotion, turn this effort into simply one nasty gossip session after another. The reader never feels invested in any of the many characters, and even when our heroine comes to her senses, there's no real sense of relief or delight. So while the tell-all nature of the book may make it hard to put down, the only real joy lies in the fact it ends quickly	2004-06-27

We all have our musical heroes and heroines that we look up too, but sometimes the things they do are so awful you just have to cringe! With chapters on everyone from Motely Crue to Trent Reznor, it appears that the authors have spared no musician or band's pride. For example, did you know that Elton John had a pair of wooden pants made for him? If that doesn't seem funny enough, how about John Lennon sticking a Kotex on his head while arrogantly walking around the Troubador Club? In addition to stories like these, each chapter contains a &quot;Quickie Bio&quot; and a &quot;Dumbest Quotes&quot; section.

Her newest story, in my opinion, has been her worst yet. Her editor really let her down on this one. Choppy, disjointed and repetitive. Back and forth in time and place. Very hard to follow, and the writing is never smooth.<br />Liysa Northon is, by anyone's standards, a sociopathic killer.  She's a hystrionic, self-centered narcissistic who has victimized scores of people by what she did. This is the story of Liysa Northon, a mother of two boys and wife to a third husband, Chris (whom she ultimately murders), a woman who is now residing in the Oregon State Prison for a dozen more years. The book chronicles her life, her relationships with all three husbands and her two young boys, and her quite successful career as a writer and photographer. She came from a divorced family; she claimed to be abused by her mother, but remains close to her father, a retired college president.<br />The writing is not brilliant -- it is rather flatly journalistic.	2004-06-02

They are not against men, and indeed, the use of humor gives them warmth and makes the ideas in the monologues more convincing.

Richard Preston provides a very detailed description of the varieties of smallpox &amp; anthrax - its symptoms, disfigurements, and various paths to death-in highly graphic language.  Preston argues that, to believe that smallbox is not held elsewhere is nonsense.  A lot of time is spent on the the anthrax attacks of 2001.  He believes that smallpox, which has killed more people than any other infectious disease, is the greatest biological threat facing humanity. Preston relates the history of smallpox from 1000 B.C. to the outbreaks in the 1970s. He goes into great detail about the World Health Organization's campaign to eradicate it and the lost opportunity to destroy it forever. His final chapter introduces the idea of genetically modified smallpox that might be resistant not only to vaccines, but also to acquired immunity. The author draws readers into his narrative by humanizing his facts; researchers, WHO workers, and smallpox victims relay parts of this vivid and alarming story.  This isn't something that you want to listen to on a full stomach.	2004-05-08

Killers on the Loose is superficially alluring but ultimately unsatisfying - the paperback equivalent of a salacious American television documentary.  The major shortcoming of Mendoza's is that he makes no reference to any other work on the subject. It's not that Mendoza hasn't carried out any research, clearly he has, but he provides no references to substantiate what appears to be a paper-bound version of the case studies on his website. The book abounds with unsourced quotes from various law enforcement officials that might be from newspapers, television news or from interviews, but the sources are never stated (in fact the only reference Mendoza provides in the whole 240 pages is to his own website). So while the cover tells us that &quot;this is the first look at serial killers at large, from one of the world's foremost authorities&quot;, this claim appears to be no more than an unsupported assertion on the part of the blurb-writer.	2004-05-08

Then as I read more of them, I noticed that they started to take on a sci-fi type story.  That's when, in my opinion, Cook started to go downhill and hasn't stopped since.<br />Like Coma and Cook's other books, this book revolves around controversial medical issues.  Two scientists involved in stem cell research and therapeutic cloning are forced by a conservative Southern senator to use their untested gene therapy to cure his Parkinson's disease. Since the procedure requires DNA, the senator asks them to use blood from the Shroud of Turin. The scientists must travel from Boston to Italy to the Bahamas, constantly avoiding scrutiny by people trying either tostop them or to discover their plans.  The procedure finally takes place within the last 70 pages, making for an anticlimactic ending, especially given the possibilities established by the overall premise. With a number of loose ends not tied up in a completely satisfactory way, the book almost begs for a sequel but I don't think I'd even bother reading it.

The other great thing about this book is that celebrities who are either vegan or vegetarian contributed to make this book.  I'm sure that when you see pictures of some people like Bill Goldberg - a WWF Wrestler, you'll be surprised.  Vegetarianism is no longer a topic to shy away from.  Millions of people are changing their lives for the better and cutting out animal products from their diets.  Now when someone asks you just what exactly do you eat... you'll be able to brag about the divine desserts and mouth watering entrees that are all animal free!

I hope that this one is the bottom because I don't think it can get much worse.  When I first started this series, it was taking me about 2 days to read a book.  I had such a hard time with this one.  The story line was long and drawn out.  In this book Dr. Blalock is recruited by ETOX (Extraterrestrial Toxic Agent Team), founded in the 1960s to examine the possibility of life beyond Earth and its implications for astronauts and now concentrating on unusual occurrences of living organisms. Their current assignment is to deal with an iceberg carrying a deadly agent that causes the rapid demise of all who come in contact with it. Meanwhile, as handpicked scientists gather off the coast of Alaska on a floating laboratory, a deadly bacteria is causing an epidemic of global proportions. Torn between two medical emergencies, Blalock must use all her skills to combat both.	2004-04-10

The first book dealt with a serial killer at the hospital and the story kept me on the edge throughout the entire book.  But it seems that each book after that has gone downhill.  They all start off as medical thrillers but end up more like a detetive novel.  Deadly Harvest was no different.  But the story has been done over and over by numerous authors.  Goldberg also fails to allow enough time for character development and abruptly catapults you into a shockingly stark climax.	2004-04-08

His letter stated that he has first hand knowledge that a slaughterhouse (Kaplan Industries) was skinning live cattle.  At first, she didn't know what to believe so she called the USDA.  A USDA inspector called her back with the findings: no cattle were being skinned alive at Kaplan.<br />She decides to contact Walker by phone.  When asked how he knew that Kaplan was skinning live cows, he stated that he was a USDA employee.  He begins to tell Eisnitz a few more details.<br />In the US alone, over one hundred and one million pigs are slaughtered each year.  Thirty seven million cattle and calves, more than four million horses, goats and sheep and over eight BILLION chickens and turkeys are killed.<br />Millions of chickens leaking yellow pus, stained green feces, contaminated by harmful bacteria and tumors are shipped for sale to customers.<br />At a Perdue plant, there is so much fecal contamination on the floor from chickens that it leaked into a workers boots and burned his feet so badly that his toenails had to be amputated.  The company won't even allow workers to leave the line to go to the bathroom so they relieve themselves on the floor.  Sometimes the chickens that are hung, fall to the floor that is covered with roaches, feces and blood.  The chickens that fall aren't even washed off before being hung back up on the line.  One worked said that he \\"saw flies on the chicken as it went down the line and maggots in boxes which contained bags that the chickens would be wrapped in.\\"  Occasionally, maggots were ground up with everything else and remained in the final product.<br />This is disturbing, and it should be.  I hope that those who read this book will do something.  Write to your senator or member of parliament, stop eating meat or even distribute this book among friends.  Just do something.  These are animals.  They feel pain just like you do.  Would you allow this to happen to a dog or cat?  They why allow it to happen to farm animals.<br />This is a book that everyone needs to read.

I read this one quickly just so I could move onto the 4th.  I don't think this book could even be called a medical thriller.  It was almost a 'cop/assasin' type book.

She candidly describes the inconvenience of flying from the perspective of a flight attendant, who constantly must handle complaints, delays, food service, air rage, customer misbehavior, and confessions from other flight attendants. Chapters stand alone, describing different aspects of the culture of airline travel; one includes the lyrics to the &quot;Safety Demo Shuffle.&quot; There are also insightful details about living in Manhattan in a small studio with a large number of roommates, about the flight attendant's complicated schedule, and about the profession's inevitable frustrations and exciting benefits.

The upside is that Clevenger's terrific insight into abnormal behavior may in fact be just because he's so twisted himself, a result, it's suggested, of his being the product of an alcoholic, suicidal, abusive father and a promiscuous mother. Now Frank is called in by Chief Emma Hancock to help send up the killer who murdered a young woman and cut her breasts off. A homeless nut wants to confess, but Frank, after interviewing him, says no. When her own niece becomes the madman's second victim, Emma gives Frank free rein to chase the perp and throws in three grams of coke to keep him stable. Meanwhile, Frank has huge fights with his live-in mate, Kathy, an ob-gyn who delivers babies all day and keeps leaving Frank because he won't quit the coke.

This book didn't shed any light on the topic.  The author claims to be a Cat Psychologist but quite frankly, I think anyone with a cat can do the same.  She's against putting cats on leashes and all for letting them roam free.  She constantly whines about a cat's bad behaviour and how people then put their cat to sleep.  I can't say that I've heard of that happening too often.  She does cover a few topics such as travelling with a cat, moving, stress and should you own a cat.  I wouldn't recommend this book at all.	2004-03-29

This is the second book by Gary Birken and I found it just as fast paced as his first.  The only complaint I have about this book is that it dragged on in places.  More than 50 pages were dedicated to a trip to Paris that really didn't need to be in the book.  Also, the ending was a bit of a flop since the book builds up so much tension.

Dr. Rat goes for the throat with appalling accuracy, clawing at the emotional core we try to protect with logic and reason. This novel forces us to look at the cruelly underside of animal experimentation, slaughtering houses and hunting. Told with a savage humor that does nothing to cushion the blow of confronting our own barbarism, Dr. Rat stands out as a masterpiece of recognition and rage.<br />The title character is a laboratory rat long mad from running the maze. &quot;Death is freedom,&quot; he shouts again and again.<br />But while Dr. Rat gaily recites the gratuitous atrocities performed on his fellows by the Learned Professor and his graduate assistants -- &quot;Nobody knows exactly what he's doing, or why. It is sufficient that each month we mention cancer and a new kind of plastic.&quot; -- the revolution brewing inside the lab mirrors a great gathering of every sort of animal in the outside world. The story flashes to the mind of a different creature for a chapter, either one suffering at the hand of man or one beginning the trek to the mustering, then flips back to Dr. Rat's lone stand against the rebelling research subjects.<br />Dr. Rat ignites emotions that most of us are less than comfortable experiencing; all the more reason to read this book and to open your eyes.<br />Even though this book is fiction, there is a lot of truth to it. This is a book I think everyone should read just so they know what happens in animal testing laboratories.  Whether you're not aware or would rather turn away from the issue, animal testing is a cruel science experiment gone wrong.	2004-03-12

Two hours and forty minutes later, she upended and sank. Only 705 survivors were picked up from her half-filled boats. And she had been called &quot;the ship that God Himself couldn't sink.&quot;<br />A Night to Remember is a minute-by-minute account of her fatal collision with an iceberg and how the resulting tragedy brought out the best and worst in human nature. Some gave their lives for others, some fought for survival. Wives beseeched husbands to join them in the boats; gentlemen went taut-lipped to their deaths in full evening dress; hundreds of steerage passengers, trapped below decks, sought help in vain.<br />If you've seen the movie by James Cameron, this book is highly recommended to get the real story.	2004-03-11

Here Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson makes the case that the animals humans eat on a regular basis-pigs, chickens, sheep, cows and ducks-feel, think and suffer. Each animal gets a chapter, in which Masson interweaves folklore, science and literature with his observations of the animals' behaviors. He relates how a pot-bellied pig saved the life of her keeper and visits Dr. Marthe Kiley-Worthington, of Little Ash Eco-Farm in England, whose cow does agility tricks; he also interviews those who raise animals for profit.  Arguing that all farming of animals for food is wrong (even eggs), Masson rebuts the fallacy that farm animals would die out without us, but doesn't say how we are to make the transition.  For far too long farm animals have been denigrated and treated merely as creatures of instinct rather than as sentient beings.  Shattering the myth of the &quot;dumb animal without feelings,&quot; Masson has written a book that is sure to stir human emotions far and wide.  However, as a vegan &amp; animal rights activist, I honestly wasn't a big fan of this book.  There were too many holes in his theories and not enough information to back things up.	2004-03-05

I knew that Traci Lords was a former porn star, but that was all I knew about her.  Born Nora Kuzma in 1968 in Ohio, she writes, she was raised in poverty and abused emotionally by an alcoholic father and raped at age 10 by a 16-year-old. By her early teens, Lords was hanging out with the wild crowd at school and was preyed upon by her mother's boyfriend, who arranged for her first modeling sessions, which led to her posing as a Penthouse centerfold at age 15 (she had false ID) and then to her meteoric career in porn, which crashed when the FBI stepped in and turned her into a poster child for sex abuse. Lords's career didn't end in 1986; she's gone on to star and costar in several films and TV shows, including John Waters's Cry Baby and Married with Children, and has enjoyed serious success as a singer. She has an amazing story to tell, and she tells it well here, without a coauthor. Frank, opinionated, intelligent, drenched in emotion, this is the rare celebrity memoir that doubles as a cautionary tale, and will have readers cheering Lords on as they speed through its gritty, big-souled pages.  Underneath It All is a powerful, uncensored, and inspirational story of how one young girl made peace with her past and triumphed over impossible odds to become a successful actress, recording artist, and, most improbably of all, a happy and healthy woman.

The title of this book is complete B.S  Yes, you are alone.  Just because there are millions of people suffering with depression, doesn't mean that these people are with you.  Depression isn't easy and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.  These stories are heartbreaking and make you feel even more alone because there's still no one to talk to.  One of the stories explained it perfectly:<br />&quot;No one wants to be around someone who's down.  Who wants to spend time with someone who's full of fear, anger and sadness?  Besides, I don't know anyone who's gone through what I'm going through right now.  What can I say to people?  That I want to check out, that I want to go to sleep and never wake up.  Nobody wants to hear that.  It's lonely being depressed.&quot;<br />I'm not saying this is a bad book, it's just that the title is completely unsuitable.	2004-02-20

The Blue Day Book is a wonderful collection of amusing, poignant animal photos and inspirational text designed to lift the spirits of anyone who's got the blues.  We all have our bad days -- it's part of being human. The solution is to see each incident in perspective, recognize that our feelings of failure and loss are not unique, and acknowledge the absurdities of our existence, and glory in the potential we all have. In less than one hundred sentences, The Blue Day Book conveys this message with great compassion and humor. Its vehicle is charming black-and-white photographs of animals that are strangely human and completely free of judgment or pretension. The easy text and beautiful images takes us through the entire evolution of a blue day -- examines what it feels like, what causes it, and how to get over it.<br />I had a choice to either buy a full size copy of this book, or a smaller version with the blue frog.  I couldn't resist the frog.  Both the book &amp; frog are perfect size to leave in your office drawer, car, or even your purse.  You can even contort the frog's face to make him happy or sad.  Whenever you're feeling blue, take a quick timeout and read this book.  You'll feel better in no time.	2004-02-16

Dr. Martha Manning was a university professor, psychologist, wife and mother.  Depression transformed her from being happy and healthy to a sleepwalker haunted by thoughts of suicide. Undercurrents chronicles this transformation through Manning's  journal entries.  We understand her terror as she evaluates a new patient only to realize that she herself meets all of the textbook criteria of depression and feel her nowhere-to-turn despair as she is forced to acknowledge that the love of her family, the support of her therapist, and the exhaustive drug treatments administered by her psychiatrist are not succeeding. Finally, Manning agrees to electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT. Notorious for its brain damage and confusion, this controversial treatment becomes her last resort and only hope.<br />While I don't think I'm at the point of considering ECT, this is definately a book I'd recommend to anyone with depression.  Not everyone has the same experiences, but if you want to explain depression to your loved ones, give them this book.	2004-02-09

The distraught Sara must work side by side with her ex-husband, Det. Jeffrey Tolliver, whom she loves despite his past infidelity, but it's Lena Adams, formerly a cop and now a campus security guard, whose story the novel follows most closely. Still mourning the murder of her sister and recovering from her own torture and rape by the same man, Lena is looked on with suspicion by her ex-boss, Jeffrey. With reason: she's hiding a few key facts. The dead boy's mother is her therapist and Lena is involved with an abusive young man with a shady past. Campus gossip Richard Carter further confuses investigators; meanwhile, police discover the bodies of two more students, their deaths potentially suicides but more likely murder.<br />After speedreading through her first two books, I was excited to get my hands on her third novel.

Peter Gethers never considered himself a cat person until the day a tiny grey ball of fluff was placed in his hands.  Enter Norton, the Scottish Fold Cat.  Gethers and Norton soon became inseperable.  From the beginning Norton exhibited extraordinary confidence no matter where he was, or in whose company; he was sensitive, intelligent and always aware of what was happening. Norton accompanied Gethers everywhere--to the office, to parties, on business trips to Los Angeles and Paris, on weekends to Fire Island; hotel staff and airline personnel were eager to serve him. Like Cleveland Amory's cat, Polar Bear, Norton became a social connoisseur who influenced his owner's love life.

Rosemary's Baby was written 1967 and you really felt as if you were there.  Son of Rosemary was set in 1999 and Levin doesn't seem to do as well with modern day atmosphere.<br />In the sequel, we learn that Rosemary Reilly divorced her loathsome husband Guy, who had sold her body to the building's coven for insemination by Satan. The coven put her into a coma when the resulting child was six years old and she was secretly planning to flee with him.  Rosemary comes out of the coma 27 years later, just as the last member of the coven, a retired dentist, is run over by a taxi. She then goes about discovering what her little demon-eyed tike has been up to in the interim.<br />By 1999, Andy is 33 years old, the same as Jesus at the time of the crucifixion. The difference is that, unlike Jesus at that age, he is the most popular man in the world.  For whatever reason, most of the people in the world wear lapel buttons that say &quot;I Love Andy&quot;. Soon they start wearing &quot;I Love Rosemary&quot; buttons, too. He does not ask much of his admirers. All that he requests is that everyone in the world light a candle at midnight, Greenwich Mean Time, on New Year's Eve, 1999. Exactly at 12:00 a.m. A harmless gesture. Surely.<br />Even more remarkable than the Antichrist's friends are his enemies, who seem to consist mostly of the followers of Ayn Rand. Known generically as &quot;P.A.&quot;s (Paranoid Atheists), they are the only people in the world who do not buy Andy's piety. The main problem they pose, however, is not that they threaten his personality cult, but that they might not light their candles with everyone else.<br />The little details are lovingly recalled in the new book. The tannis root. The scrabble. And then, of course, there is the wicked anagram, ROAST MULES. One word.	2004-01-23

After a few cuts and scratches, Amory manages to get the cat, who isn't overly happy about being rescued.  Once the cat was brought back to the apartment, he takes off running to see if he could find an escape route.  Altough he did manage to get himself stuck under the diswasher, on his own time, he came out from hiding.  After a bath, which the cat was quite happy to have, he turned out to be a beautiful white cat with sparkling green eyes.  Amory then had decided that he wasn't giving his new companion up, even though this was supposed to be a temporary arrangement.<br />So begins the story of Mr. Amory and his new companion Polar Bear.  One afternoon, Amory gave the cat a toy ball, something he had obviously never had before. After batting it around a few times, he lost it.  Amory attempted to train his cat to fetch the ball, since he was getting tired of playing Golden Retriever.  The cat looked at him and thumped his tail a few times, trying to get into his head that cats do not fetch or retrieve.  Amory figured that cats simply did not like games.  When in fact, cats do like games, but only on their terms.  These games must be games that they wanted to play, and must be initiated by them.<br />This is such a wonderful story of how a crusty cat changed the life of a former &quot;dog person&quot;.  This book is a must for cat people.	2003-12-10

There were 25 recipes from all over the world for cooking a mouse.  It's not a book I'd purchase because I don't think I'd read it again or recommend it to anyone.  There were a few recipes that were cute, such as Mouse In Black Bean Sauce, a Chinese dish that will leave your cat hungry again in an hour.

Any person owned by a cat will know that when the Christmas season arrives, cats seem to have this ability to leave a path of destruction wherever they go.  The pictures in this book are really funny, especially to us cat people.  On each page, there are a few words to describe the picture but the image says it all.  Some of the best ones are a nicely wrapped mouse trap with cheese left right infront of a mouse hole.  The 'forbidden fruits'.. all of your glass christmas baubles, reduced to tangled shreds.  The Powder Room is my favorite.  A cat stands beside a festive litter box.  The pictures are so clever.  Whether they're shredding your nicely wrapped gifts or attempting to reach the top of your tree, it's still funny.  This is a book I'd recommend to anyone who has a cat.  It's a really fast read but I'd keep it out on the table at Christmas for others to read.	2003-12-08

Instead of writing fiction, he has chosen to write a bio about Dr. John Kappler.  In 1975, Dr. Kappler, an anesthesiologist, secretly attempted to kill a pregnant patient by giving her the wrong anesthetic, deliberately sent a patient into cardiac arrest and with his car, ran down two innocent people.  His fellow doctors not only rescued him from jail, but also allowed him to continue practicing medicine.  At his trial, Kappler pleaded insanity, claiming he had heard voices telling him to kill people.

I didn't find this book funny at all.  Veteran standup comic, George Carlin takes his own shot at authorship.  Unlike many comics who focus on a limited range of subjects, Carlin has a versatile talent and his book covers everything from pitiful puns to classically structured jokes.  He is less successful when he examines things he deeply cares about, like politics and justice. His anger is too close to the surface. Many of his jokes are taken straight from his stage act and they suffer by being reduced to printed page.  I do recommend his other book, Napalm &amp; Silly Putty.	2003-11-24

John Robinson was a businessman, Eagle Scout and Man of the Year. Very few people knew the real John Robinson. Three quarters of the book deals with the prior crimes committed by John.

Moore opened my eyes to the lies that are going on right under American's noses.<br />*With approval from the FBI and the help of the Saudi government, the relatives of Osama bin Laden were allowed to leave the US, assisted by US authorities right after the terror attacks.  They never went through any serious interrogation, other than a few questions that the FBI asked them.<br />*Days after September 11, the FBI started a search to see if any of the 186 suspects purchased guns.  They found 2.  Enter Attorney General, John Ashcroft.  When he heard about this, he shut the search down.  Why?<br />*In 1997, while Dubya was governor of Texas, the Taliban travelled to Texas to meet with Bush's oil & gas company friends.<br />*In 2002, a senior American diplomat was sent to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq had tried to buy yellow cake uranium.  He concluded that the allegations were false.  The White House ignored this report and kept the hoax alive.<br />*Weapons of mass distructions:  Both Bush and Tony Blair assured people that Iraq did have mobile labs to produce WMD.  Bush declared that they had infact found two of these weapons facilities.  After an investigation into the two trailers, they found that they were not germ warfare labs, but were for the production of hydrogen to fill artillery balloon as the Iraqis had said all along.  Yes, Saddam did at one point have WMD, but they were given to him by the US.  In fact, the US also supplied Saddam with such biotoxins as Anthrax, Botulisim and many more.  Even many US companies assisted Iraq in making the WMD:<br />Hewlett Packard<br />AT&T<br />DuPont Kodak<br />While Bush had tried so hard to convince everyone that Saddam and Osama bin Laden were working together on the 9/11 attacks, a memo was leaked that said there were no links between Saddam and Osama.  In fact, bin Laden considers Saddam to be an infidel.<br />When Bush decided to attack Baghdad, he used so called \\"precision-guided\\" bombing that is accurate to almost an inch.  After two bombing campaigns, 9000 civilians were murdered.  So much for accuracy.<br />How is it any different that when the US kills civilians, it's called \\"collateral damage\\" but when anyone else kills US citizens, it's called terrorism. What about the 9000 dead in Iraq?<br />Instead of telling everyone else to get rid of their WMD, how about starting at home in the US?

Auschwitz: a name without significance for us at the time, but it at least implied some place on this earth\\"<br />Primo Levi's memoir, Survival in Auschwitz, is a moving account of one young man's struggle for survival in the notorious Polish concentration camp. Levi employs a unique narrative structure, emphasizing the power of words both thematically and stylistically. Levi is only twenty-five when he enters the camp, and his storytelling does much to reveal the devastating impact that concentration camps had on the psyche and on the spirit. Levi confronts the harsh reality of what life in Auschwitz means, and how different it is from any form of civilization.  In clear contrast to the camp's dehumanizing effects on its victims, Levi uses language to stir the hearts of his readers. In a kind of dictionary of suffering, he gives the reader the terms of his old existence: Buna, where young men labor in a factory that will never produce synthetic rubber; Ka-Be, the infirmary where Levi is granted a few weeks' rest to recover from a foot injury, and Selekcja, the Polish word for \\"selection,\\" that seals the fate of those marked for the crematorium.  Many readers wishing to learn more about the Holocaust or concentration camps will find Levi's work powerful and enriching. Perhaps more importantly, these readers will continue to ask Levi's questions in today's society.	2003-09-17

Working at P&G soon became a nightmare for a lot of people, especially women and minorities.

With degree in hand, he began working.  He took jobs as a dishwasher just to get in the kitchen.  He briefly talks about when to eat at a restaurant and when not to.  As well as what to look out for if you decide to eat out.  There's even a section where he recommends specific kitchen knives and ingredients you need to have on hand.  Most of the book though is dedicated to his life as a chef.  You'll love it!	2003-09-10

It was a really quick read, I polished it off in one sitting.  But I feel like I missed something.  It was a good book except for the fact that I'm still not sure what happened at the end.<br />It's a fairly simple plot.  Joanna Eberhart and her family move to the quite town of Stepford.  She meets and befriends another woman, Bobbie.  While the two of them set out to find other women who might be interested in organizing a womens group, all they can find are women who are interested in staying at home and cleaning the house.  Soon, Bobbie and her husband decide to have a second honeymoon.  But when she returns, all Bobbie wants to do is houseclean, just like all the other women.	2003-09-04

Aside from the fact that I began to wonder if the author was actually stoned when she wrote the book (she made references to this), this was a fairly good book.<br />Barbara Ehrenreich sets out to prove that working for minimum wage in the US while trying to eat & have a roof over your head is extremely difficult.  Frequently, she'll scour the want ads only to realize that these companies aren't actually hiring, they're just want to be able to have applications on hand if/when someone quits.  Finding a place to live was no easy task either.  When you're working for [money amount]/hour it's pretty difficult to come up with first & last months rent, even though, I feel, that the author cheated somewhat because she brought her savings with her so that she could afford the first & last.  Some of the work conditions are rather ignorant.  No meal breaks, no talking with other employees, no standing around, etc...  It's unfortunate that a lot of people don't have the option to quit and go to some better job.	2003-09-03

Talk about information overload.. this book could have been half its length.  The plot is great; people start experiencing flu-like symptoms but unlike the flu they convulse, bleed out and die.

Ron and Dan Lafferty, both Mormon Fundamentalists who commit double murder insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their victims. Beginning with a very well researched account of this crime, Krakauer constructs an appalling narrative of delusion, savage violence and strict faith. He even analyzes the abduction of fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart. They had her so brainwashed that she even denied being Elizabeth.  These Fundamentalists believe that the mainstream church went astray when they renounced polygamy.  After finishing this book, I'm still in a state of disbelief.  John Krakauer is an amazing writer and I think that this is his best work yet.	2003-08-25

Then things changed. The Catholic Youth recruiter who he wanted to lose his virginity to took up with a lifeguard, his mother divorced and remarried someone he didn't like, he failed religion and his father &quot;fell off the wagon&quot;.  Soon he stopped attending church, stopped praying and felt God had let him down.<br />Fast forward twenty years and he finds himself in the doorway of a Buddhist monastery.  He soon realizes that no one is talking about venial sins and there are no confessionals, just a feeling of peace.  After his short retreat at the monastery, he attends another while on a business trip.  A Tibetan Monk explains that what makes us unhappy is our tendancy to desire things that make us happy.  For example, by thinking that as soon as I get a new job, I'll be happy.  But one we get the job, the happiness and expectations are dashed.  He also says that while it's ok to have a comfortable home, a nice car and deliberately arrange our lives in such a way that these things become possible, but don't depend on them to make you happy.  Happiness is internal, not external.<br />After attending the retreat he realizes that he sat though &quot;basically a six hour sermon&quot;.  Being a former catholic as well, I know the feeling all too well.  Even a fifteen minute sermon was always too long.  They were &quot;endless, irrelevant and forced up me by a condescending adult.&quot;  It's reassuring to know that a Tibetan monk isn't going to tell you that you're a terrible person and you're going to hell.<br />It's a rather humorous book and Moore is always referring to his &quot;Monkey Mind&quot;, meaning that his mind is always on something else when he's trying to meditate or understand what the monks and nuns are saying.<br />It's one's desire for things to be a certain way that will make you unhappy.  Becoming upset because someone is late has nothing to do with the person, but your reaction to the tardiness.. bascially, it's not the fault of the other person, it's the way you are dealing with it.se someone is late has nothing to do with the person, but your reaction to the tardiness.. bascially, it's not the fault of the other person, it's the way you are dealing with it.	2003-08-22

The activists believed that McDonalds exploited children, depressed wages, leveled South and Central American rain forests and subjected its cattle and chicken to mass slaughters.<br />Without benefit of a lawyer or funds from legal aid, Helen Steel and Dave Morris acted as their own attorneys in facing McDonalds' legal teams. British libel law required that Steel and Morris prove the accuracy of virtually every statement made in the flyer.<br />Unfortunately, the judge found that Helen and Dave had not proved the allegations against McDonald's.  But they had shown that McDonald's does exploit children with their advertising, falsely advertised their food as nutritious and are culpably responsible for cruelty to animals reared for their products.  In the end, the two were ordered to pay but McDonald's dropped the claim and left with a very tarnished image.	2003-08-18

Dr. Canty was obsessed with a hooker/drug addict named Dawn Spens. Canty found himself caught in a world of multiple identities, drug addictions and blackmail.  Dawn and her pimp/boyfriend John Fry tried to get as much money out of Canty as they could.

Although it has been almost two years since this horrific event, it still seems like yesterday to me.  Right from page one, the author begins to talk about the people who jumped from the Twin Towers.  He continues talking about this for a few pages.  For me, seeing people jump is the one very vivid image that still haunts me.  He goes into very graphic detail about the jumpers.  About how one man was impaled on a street sign. Reading this book was like reliving Sept 11 all over again.  If you're not ready to relive the experience, please do not read this book.  The rest of the book gives a short bio on some of the terrorists and some of the innocent people who were killed on 9/11.  The book also documents the growing hatred of Amercia and how the terrorists came to be.  It was surprising to note just how much the FBI knew but how little they actually did.	2003-08-13

As a convert from Catholicisim to Buddhism, I was pleased to read that the  Dalai Lama considers himself to be just a regular human, who was chosen to fulfill a specific role.  After reading this book, you get the sense that he would be a very pleasant person to talk with.<br />On the downside, I was absolutely shocked to read about what the Chinese Government has done to Tibet and its people.  Tibet is a peace loving country and to be in the army, was the lowest form of life.  A 17 point 'agreement' was drawn up by the Chinese for Tibet.  Members of the Tibetan delegation were forced under duress to sign the agreement and phony Tibetan state seals were used.  Large Tibetan estates were confiscated and redistributed by the Chinese.  After monks and nuns were arrested, they were forced, in public, to break their vows of celibacy with one another and even to kill people.<br />The Tibetan Freedom Fighters were no match for the Chinese army.  Besides using bombers to obliterate towns and villages, the Chinese army also crucified, disembowelled, beheaded and buried many Tibetans alive.  In order to prevent Tibetans from giving praise to the Dalai Lama on their way to execution, the Chinese tore out their tongues with meat hooks.<br />It was really disheartening to read about what happened to these people.  I think this is a book that everyone at some point needs to read.  It really opened my eyes.	2003-08-11

Before 9/11, I had never heard of Harold Lutnick, let alone Cantor Fitzgerald.  From that day forward, Cantor Fitzgerald has been ingrained into my head forever.  I did not want to put this book down.  The story is told by Harold Lutnick and his friend Tom Barbash as well as a few surviving Cantor employees.  The beginning of the book is a lot to take in; it was like reliving 9/11 all over again.  Out of 1000 employees, Cantor lost over 600 people.  After a few media interviews, Howard was made out to be a horrible person.  He stopped paying all deceased and missing employees right away.  He did this so that the company could survive and pay money to the families of the survivors.  Many people actually questioned whether his tears were phony or not.

The last John Grisham book I read was The Runaway Jury and there were parts in The King of Torts that reminded me of that book.<br />The book begins with Clay Carter, a lawyer working in the Office of the Public Defender (OPD).  He is quickly assigned a case to provide legal counsel to a murderer.  He tries to pawn the case off on another lawyer, but he's unsucessful in doing so.  He soon gets a call from Max Pace, who seems to have the perfect case but all he needs is a good lawyer.  Clay takes on the case and makes millions.  Max happens to have more and more cases, each guaranteeing millions, but a what cost?  After living in the lap of luxury, Clay realizes that it has all be at the expense of his clients.<br />This book was such a fast paced read.  Whether you're a John Grisham fan or not, any suspense fan would love this book.	2003-06-22

After reading a few reviews, I wasn't sure that I still wanted to read it but I'm very happy that I did.<br />Andrea Sachs gets a job (a job that a million girls would kill for) working as Miranda Priestly's junior assistant.  Miranda is the head honcho at Runway magazine and when she says jump, you don't even ask \\"how high\\", you just do it.  Andrea soon realizes that her so called job isn't all what it's cracked up to be.  She has to take care of Miranda's laundry, her meals, which by the way must be hot and placed in a specific way and so many more meaningless tasks.  If you've ever had a boss that you absolutely hated, reading this book will probably make your boss seem like an angel.  Strange thing though, I just don't ever recall Miranda wearing Prada as the title refers.	2003-06-12

Some of this book is difficult to stomach.  While it may seem unbelievable, it is a true account.  Male chicks are literally thrown in the garbage, others are debeaked with a hot iron, pigs are kept confined in tiny stalls.. so tiny that they cannot turn around.

People are always looking for the easy way out. People want to eat what they want, not exercise but still be slim. Well, Atkins can only work for so long. Stop to think about it for a minute, eating all the meat you want.. that is not healthy. Sure you'll lose weight on Atkins but what are you giving up in exchange for a few pounds? The consumption of animal products has been conclusively linked with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Cholesterol (found only in animal products) and animal fat clog arteries, leading to heart attacks and strokes. The rate of colon cancer is highest in regions where meat consumption is high and lowest where meat-eating is uncommon. A similar pattern is evident for breast, cervical, uterine, ovarian, prostate, and lung cancers.	2003-05-07

There are actually quotas that schools have to meet in terms of product sales or these companies will pull out.  So much for fast food in moderation.  These kids are being targeted by these companies from the time they wake up until they go to bed.  It's no wonder that obesity is such a huge problem.<br />I find it strange, yet believable, that more that 70% of fast food visits are impulsive.<br />*On old McDonald's job application forms, it said that employees who wouldn't submit to a lie detector test could face dismissal.<br />*In 1997 a group of teenager workers at a McDonalds in Quebec applied to the Teamsters Union.

This is a great book for anyone who wants to know more about Big Brother and all the other things 'they' don't want you to know about. Not only is it full of interesting ideas but it is backed up with a biblography for each conspiracy.  New to this edition of the classic text are theories on the death of Princess Di, the vast right-wing conspiracy, the real men in black, Armageddon countdowns, and much more. You could pass on buying this book, all the while keeping your head in the sand, but I recommend against it.	2003-03-11

Like a lot of young women with low self esteem, she slowly believes that he is the only person who will ever love someone like her because of her many faults.  Slowly, with the helps of therapists, she finds confidence and love.  Thomas Capano cannot stand this.  He wants all his women to need him and do what he wants and if he can't have them, no one will.<br />The story behind this book is very common but it just seemed to drag on for a long time.  I really enjoy reading Ann Rule but I found myself scanning pages because there was a lot of unnecessary info.  It's a good read nonetheless.	2003-03-10

It's a really short read but you'll probably find yourself nodding your head in agreement many, many times.<br />How often have you tried to read the newspaper or eat dinner in peace only to have kitty stalking you.

By art class her nose is runny and she's severely disoriented. Within seconds, she's in convulsions can't stop biting herself.  Enter Alice Austen, a doctor with the CDC who realizes that Kate's nervous system had been virtually destroyed.

If you're like me, your cat is a family member and deserves to be treated like one.  The author offers suggestions on how to make kitty's life more enjoyable just by moving a piece of furniture close to a window so that kitty can look out.  A window is a cat's TV.

This was the first Ann Rule book that I have read and I am now hooked.  In perhaps the first true-crime book written at the victim's request, Ann Rule untangles a web of lies and brutality that culminated in the murder of Sheila Blackthorne. Although happy in a loving second marriage, and a new family of quadruplets, Sheila never truly escaped the vicious enslavement of her ex-husband, multi-millionaire Allen Blackthorne, a controlling sociopath who subjected Sheila to unthinkable abuse in their marriage, and terrorized her for a decade after their divorce. When Sheila was slain in her home, in the presence of her four toddlers, authorities raced to link the crime to Blackthorne, the man who vowed to monitor Sheila's every move in his obsessive quest for power and revenge.	2003-02-14

I really didn't learn all that much about John Nash.  However I did learn about M.I.T, Einstein, Princeton University and other famous places and people.  It's not that I was really disappointed but I think the book could have been a lot shorter if it just stuck with the story of John Nash.  A lot of chapters in the book didn't even discuss John.

From October to May, the Torrance family has to take care of the Overlook hotel with no communication to the outside world.. except for Danny's 'shining'.

For some reason, maybe because the printing is large, the story seemed short.<br />The book is based around a highly contriversial topic, euthanasia.  Most of Palmer's books have been centered highly around hospitals and procedures.  While this one had a doctor and nurse, it didn't seem like one of his typical books.

The book started off as a real page turner, however by about the mid way point is slowed down a bit and that chapters seemed to never end. Still it is a worthwhile read.	2002-11-26

Right from the beginning I was laughing.. then crying and repeating that throughout the whole book.<br />I guarantee you'll laugh out loud many times, especially if you are/were a Catholic.  The &quot;Holy Toast&quot; had me laughing for quite a while.<br />Sometimes it's hard to imagine a life as difficult as what he lived.  Having nothing to eat, or eating a sheeps head for dinner.  The living conditions I think were almost worse.  Bug filled beds, flooded houses or living behind a communal loo.  This is one of the few books that I can read more than once and still enjoy it as much as the first time.	2002-11-26

I figured her book would provide some insight in to her life.  If I wanted to see a photo album I'll look for pictures online.. I wanted to read about her.  There really wasn't a lot of information about her in this book.  The title throws you off a bit.. &quot;If they only know&quot;..  Well tell us something!  Not a good book by any means.	2002-11-26

When I read the reviews and page excerpts I thought I would like it.  I was wrong.  I just got the feeling that Marya is the snobby, pretentious type and I couldn't get past that.

My Name Is Caroline is a wonderful book for anyone who is/was bulimic.  She never tried to hide any of her feelings in this book.  You understand and sympathize with her.  She is the typical/textbook bulimic.  Upper-middle class, perfectionist, controlling parents...  She shows you that there is hope and that you don't have to live your life like this.	2002-11-26

I don't normally like sales books but this one was actually pretty good.  There are quite a few suggestions he makes which are actually good.  He covers everything from writing proposals to handling objections.  This book is written in simple terms, so simple that a lot of sales people overlook them.  You may not read the entire thing from cover to cover but I'm sure you take away a few hints to help you with your sales.	2002-11-25

I've had it for a year and I still haven't finished the entire thing.  I'm 95% done.  The beginning of the book is fairly good and summarizes embedded linux.

This shouldn't keep anyone from not reading this book.<br />Once again, Michael Palmer leads the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions.  For the first time, it wasn't until near the end that I finally caught on.  This is one of his better book.s	2002-11-22

The book begins in Germany during WWII with Nazi doctors conducting experiments on humans.  Then, forty years later the story continues.  Usually his books are full of suspense and drama.  This book lacked both.  I kept reading it in hopes that it would get better.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  I don't recommend this book to anyone.	2002-11-18

While most of the books I've read by Palmer deal mainly with hospital life, this book focused a lot of hospital politics.  The book itself was good, but not one of his better books.  The ending of the book dropped off very quickly and left me wondering and guessing what happened.  If you're a Palmer fan, read it.  Otherwise, try another of his books.	2002-11-15

His novels are full of plot twists, detailed characters and just the right amount of suspense.<br />Natural Causes is just another of his well written books that will keep you hanging on until the end.  The best part about his books is the right from page one, you're hooked.<br />Natural Causes does have some truth to it and makes you wonder about 'Natural' supplements.	2002-11-07

Although the authors say this book is fiction, when really it's based on their days as nannies.  It's disheartening to think that there are people out there like Mr. & Mrs. X.  Horrible people.  And you wonder why kids turn out poorly.  One thing that made me really mad... Earmuffs.  Those of you who read it know exactly what I mean.<br />This book is for anyone.

Fatal is one of Michael Palmer's better books, although I have to say the ending was a bit of a let down.  For anyone who enjoys medical dramas, this book is for you.  Palmer leads you on a trail believing the problem is one thing, then the plot twists and you realize it's a completely different issue.  There were quit a few characters and plot lines yet they all came together quite nicely.	2002-10-30

It's nice to know that people actually believe that \\"baby bush\\" is an ....  Michael Moore's book had me nodding my head the entire time.  This book is great.  The author does not hide his opinion at all.  In fact, he openly believes that George W. is an impostor and shouldn't be president.  Parts of this book will make you angry.  Not at the author, but at the incompitent morons who represent the American people.  Thank God I'm Canadian.	2002-10-09

Anyone who is interested or curious about demonology should read this book.  However, I do have one problem with this book.  Being a former catholic myself, I am confused.  Sarchie states in the book, he is a Traditionalist Catholic, a group that split with the Roman Catholic Church after Vatican II to pursue earlier forms of the sacraments. However, he believes in such concepts as elementals and chakras on top of this.<br />When all is said and done, one can't help but like Sarchie. He is very candid about his faults and his constant efforts to juggle his duties as cop (&quot;the Job&quot;), exorcist (&quot;the Work&quot;), father, and husband. Even if you do not agree with Sarchie's beliefs or methods, he comes across as an honest person thrust into extraordinary circumstances	2002-10-07

I related easily to this book and profile in the case studies.  Sometimes, you think he's discussing your family.
