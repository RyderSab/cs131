This is a short, honest, informally written, unpretentious and mostly amusing account by and about a once common but now fast disappearing type of socially conscious attorney in our big American cities.  A late sixties graduate of an elite law school, Geoghegan sought to change the world through the court system, to do well by doing good.  Now, some forty years later, he tells us that he settles almost all his civil cases and he details the many ways in which he can't begin to try a criminal one.  Geoghegan has also found it necessary to settle in many other, more important respects.  He makes less than a first year associate at a large firm.  He no longer looks to the courts to upset the status quo.  Even as recently as Clinton, he expected intelligence on the federal bench.  Now he finds less and less--and that was before Harriet Miers called George W the brightest man she ever met! <br />Although the dust jacket suggests otherwise, this is light reading about a number of serious topics.  I think Geoghegan owes us more.	2005-10-10

It is well-written, literate in its allusions, sometimes amusing and always modest.  Yet it disappoints because ultimately it is no more nourishing or exciting than \\"comfort food\\" for those of us who are mired in middle age and welcome any reassurance that on issues of money, sex, health, and personal loss we are little different from others in our feelings of insecurity and diminished expectations.  There is little drama or development in this book.  It also would have been improved had the author been willing to delve deeper, to be less coy and a little more concrete.  Thus, by way of small example, Atlas might have informed the reader that he went to college at Harvard and not forced the reader to deduce it from his many references to Cambridge and the 25th Reunion Report.  This might have begun to explain some of his initial delusions of grandeur and his subsequent disappointments.	2005-09-04

Central America and all of its 500 passengers and crew in the face of a relentless hurricane somewhere north of Cuba; the other of Tommy Thompson, a young and inventive engineer, whose efforts to retrieve the lost treasure on that same ship prove ultimately successful, more than a hundred years later and more than two miles down on the ocean floor.  The author writes in an engaging style but the book would greatly benefit from more focus and organization.  Their absence is apparent in:  (1) chapter headings that give no more than the time and place of what is to follow; (2) the depiction of an over-abundance of minor characters, quickly drawn and sooner forgotten; (3) too lengthy or essentially repetitive description making 500 pages where 400 would have done; (4) the glaring lack of an index, photographs, pictures, or just designs of the many innovative devices which were so critical to Thompson's success.  Also disturbing is that the author submitted his manuscript for Thompson's review in order that Thompson might assure himself that his proprietary interests were not being compromised.  In this and other ways, the author reveals himself as far too deferential, solicitous and admiring of a man who, more objectively described, would have been better understood as putting his trousers on, one leg at a time.	2005-08-10

Linda Greenhouse doesn't quite explain how this rather unprepossessing figure achieved such high office.  He was bright and industrious, to be sure, but so were many others.  He was not a strong personality or even particularly personable or outgoing.  But in one respect at least, Blackmun seems to have been truly extraordinary--his penchant from an early age for recording the events of his life and collecting almost every note, letter or document which related to it--as if he knew and were determined to become someone of substance.  Indeed, Greenhouse tells us that Blackmun's collection comprises more than one and a half million items, is contained in some 1585 boxes, and takes up more than 600 feet of shelf space in the Library of Congress. <br /> <br />Greenhouse makes wonderful use of this massive collection, writing a remarkably spare yet elegant narrative of what she quite rightly calls \\"a consequential life,\\" one that spanned the twentieth century and left its mark not only on the law but on American society.  Blackmun's bookish reticence may not make him very attractive or interesting to the general reader, but for those seeking a better understanding of the modern Supreme Court and some of its Justices, this volume is as invaluable as it is fascinating.  We see Blackmun increasingly determined to do justice as much as to apply the law, with Greenhouse focusing on his opinions having to do with abortion, capital punishment, and sex discrimination.  We see Blackmun grow totally estranged from Chief Justice Warren Burger, his closest childhood friend at whose wedding he served as best man.  We see Blackmun relate more closely to his young law clerks, some of whom seem to have authored the most memorable lines in his opinions. <br /> <br />Someone else will have to research and interview more widely to write the definitive, full-length biography and survey Blackmun's entire judicial career.  But we owe muchto Greenhouse for this wonderful and most timely introduction. <br />	2005-05-24

I found Grisham not to be a particularly good writer and his plot quite predictable.  And yet I thoroughly enjoyed the book, at least hearing it on tape.  Maybe much of it was the wonderfully rich and varied voice of the reader.  Max Pace sounded so evil and enticing as the disbarred lawyer--ruthlessly working behind the scenes to save his corporate clients from their competitors and from their own, sometimes deadly, products.  Carter Clay quickly succumbs to Pace's machinations, abandoning his client and the Public Defenders Office, to become a mass tort lawyer, collecting millions of dollars in contingent fees without ever stepping inside a courtroom.  One first feels the exhilaration with which Clay gets and spends his ill-gotten gains.  Then one experiences an even greater satisfaction when it all gets taken away.  In the process, there is insight into a certain segment of the bar, and why tort reform has become so appealing.	2005-05-04

I do want to register, however, my great enthusiasm for this book.  It should be irresistable to anyone interested in words, good writing, dictionary making, madness, personal relations, the horrors of war, social class, insane asylums, crime and punishment, and much more.  Although some reviewers grew impatient with Winchester's meandering style, I think it  engaging and entirely appropriate to the post-Victorian period being described.  I particularly enjoyed the questions the author raises, ones which defy easy answers such as, for instance, the origins of Dr. Miner's madness and whether, in his case, he found the best palliative available, namely the tedious task of creating the OED.  Was Dr. Miner's crime explicable?  Could he have managed in a less restrictive setting?	2005-03-19

Armed with passable Polish and the outlines of the history of Poland, he travels to that country in 1995 and tracks down the vestiges of an older Jewish community and the emergence of a newer one.  Among his subjects we find less anger or self-pity than a gritty determination to defy the odds and hold onto tradition, even though that tradition must be reinvented and redefined. <br /> <br />I recommend this book without qualification.  Mayer may not be a novelist, but his characters draw you in and leave you with the same kind of inchoate satisfaction and understanding that Jumpa Lahiri was able to achieve in exploring her Indian background in The Namesake. <br />	2005-01-18

Wolfe has turned his jaundiced eye and ear on yet another curious aspect of late 20th, early 21st century culture:  the college scene at an academically prestigious, sports-addled, frat-sorority happy place that I think has to be Duke.  I've read most of Wolfe's earlier send-ups--on modern art, limousine liberals, astronauts, Wall Street bond sellers, and real estate moguls.  I see this as little different in its display of Wolfe's strengths and weaknesses.  Either you enjoy the former so much that you put up with the latter, or you simply don't.    Primary among Wolfe's strengths are a remarkably perceptive and amusingly exaggerated ability to observe and relate physical detail and the spoken word.  Primary among Wolfe's weaknesses are his superficial understanding of character and his impatience with plot development.    On balance, I found this book both enjoyable and enlightening.  Yes, it's too long, it's too predictable, and it's too overdrawn.  Yet, I was entertained and quite certain that I had gained new insights into the influence of sports and fraternities/sororities, as well as some of the conflicts that arise as a result, not only among the student body but between faculty and administrators.    I must confess that I have been out of college more than 35 years.  However, I teach college in an adjunct capacity and have one daughter who's a junior in college, with another one soon to be a freshman.  Contrary to what some of the student reviewers have written, I am not shocked as a parent by the language or content of Wolfe's book.  I would, in fact, recommend the book to students.  It will enrich their vocabulary and make them better understand that there is virtue in moderation!	2005-01-10

It is told entirely from the viewpoint of the memoirist, of course.  She unfortunately maintains complete equanimity and betrays no personal faults despite the extreme hardship after the death of her mother and the almost uniform cruelty and desperation of almost everyone with whom she interacts.  I felt the story lacked emotion and depth.  It could have been a fable or a children's story but I don't think it qualifies as fiction.  For a better version of a similar story, I recommend Theodore Dreiser's classic novel, Sister Carrie, about an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago at the turn of the 20th century, where she becomes a kept woman.	2005-01-04

As I recall, the first chapter or two of the book was excerpted in the New Yorker before it was published in its full length.  I found it more satisfying, more literate, and, yes, less cinematic.  There was the father's childhood in India, the fantastical tale of a book saving his life in a trainwreck, the decision to name his son after the author of that book, and the interesting way in which his relationship develops with the mother whose marriage to the father had been arranged.    The problem with the rest of the book is that it proceeds in quite predictable and conventional ways, in what seems to be almost strictly chronological order.    Some previous reviewers have properly noted the author's understated and graceful prose.  As someone who lives in Cambridge, I can add that the author's prose is uncanny in the accuracy of its physical description.  And yet I must confess that I wished for more of a plot, with a climax and a catharsis.  As it is, the book ultimatelty conveys familiarity but not much profound understanding.  Where will Gogol go from here, now that his father is dead, his marriage over, and his mother gone back to India?  Only a sequel, again like the movies, will tell....	2005-01-01

At 145 pages, this volume is perhaps Posner's shortest and--both because it is aimed at a general audience and resulted from a lecture series--one of his most readable.  My sense, however, is that it would only appeal to those already steeped in the profession.  Not even a law student would find instructive comparisons with Stone, Hand, Friendly, Prosser, or Schaeffer.  For those in the profession, however, I recommend this book most highly.  It is less valuable for its purported study in reputation than for its profound, if succinct, understanding of Cardozo the man and the insight it provides into the style and logic of some of his best known decisions, Palsgraf and MacPherson chief among them.  Posner's original attempt at a quantitative understanding of reputation relies on Cardozo's relative frequency of citation in some Westlaw data bases over the years.  It is pseudo-scientific, redolent of Posner's application of economics to an understanding of the law and, while interesting, not very meaningful.  The book as a whole, however, is most gratifying.	2004-10-13

Joseph Hallinan has unwittingly confirmed this, in his highly readable and excellently written travelogue of a self-confessed prison buff. We can perceive a country obsessed with material prosperity, technology, job-creation of any sort, and security. It matters not that we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world or that we have relinquished the goal of inmate rehabilitation in favor of simple warehousing. Hallinan points out that, after all, most inmates never had a loving home, decent education, or religious faith in the first place. Hallinan leaves us with the conclusion that he can offer us \\"no magic cures.\\" This is obvious.  What is less obvious or excusable is his failure to employ his abundant familiarity with the problem to explore some areas for greater endeavor or, if not that, at least to provide chapter headings and an end of volume index to guide the reader as to his less ambitious thinking. <br />	2004-10-02

I came across this book purely by chance as someone with a BA in history (from almost 40 years ago) who remembered much enjoying EH Carr's What Is History.  Well, although he is prone to repetition, I think Evans writes wonderfully well and most persuasively, matches his views with those of a succession of historians, some well known to me and others not at all.  As a jury trial lawyer, I relished the similarities and differences in our two professions--as, for example, Evans's reference to Flaubert who said that a historian drinks an ocean only for the purpose of producing a cupful of piss.	2004-08-27

I had only read a couple of the essays in this collection when they first appeared in the NYReview of Books, the New Yorker, and elsewhere.  As the amorphous title of the book suggests, its sum is not much greater than its parts, and yet I found most of the parts completely engaging and very rewarding.  The pieces on Justice Holmes, James Bryant Conant, Al Gore, Bill Paley, and the New Yorker magazine itself were perhaps the best, although I admit that it's pretty much Bos-Wash stuff and may not appeal to a mass readership.  One reviewer here has called the writing \\"stilted.\\"  I could not agree less.  Although as of this year a member of the Harvard faculty, he, like his colleague Henry Louis Gates, Jr. (also a contributor to the New Yorker), avoids academic jargon and writes most felicitously and well.  I'm not sure about the discipline of \\"historical studies\\" but Menand is certainly one of its best practitioners.	2004-08-27

The lawsuits against day care providers based on the testimony of children have subsided, but this book does not seem in the least dated as a result.  Beside being the defendant, Alice is one of a number of wonderfully drawn characters--an Ann Arbor, back to nature, '60's woman with all the sensibilities and naivite that such would imply.  Her tragedy could be ours and yet, along the way, she finds a messy kind of redemption which seems very real and which sustains at least this reader's faith in the human condition.	2004-08-27

At 656 pages, plus another hundred pages of source notes and bibliography, this volume comprises an extremely thorough and well-documented study of John Adams.  Much of it is derived from correspondence with his highly literate and intelligent &quot;best friend&quot; Abigail who remained a total of six years apart from her husband, running the farm at Braintree while her husband helped create a new nation and then helped conduct its business in Philadelphia, Paris, the Hague, London, and Washington.<br />The reader cannot but come away impressed by Adams's courage and steadfastness of purpose.  As he himself recognized, he was but one of many, and perhaps less extraordinary than Jefferson or Hamilton.  Yet Adams seems the most virtuous and wise.  A learned farmer of absolute honesty and great self-discipline and devotion, he suggests by way of contrast to Reagan--the TV actor--and George W. Bush--the cheerleading Daddy's boy weaned on oil field speculation and a baseball franchise--why we are in such a fix today, and why the world holds us in such low esteem!	2003-08-27

This makes all the more remarkable the achievement this book represents.  For like the owner, trainer, and jockeys of the horse Seabiscuit, the author overcame great odds to recognize that this story &quot;had legs.&quot;  Though the story lacks some of the depth of fiction or the detail of history, it does much to combine the two in page-turning, lyrical prose that informs us not only about the intricacies of horseracing, but also the expansion of the country, the arrival of the automobile, the impact of the depression, and the importance of human as well as equine character in determining destiny.

This book does much to make that all clear, in prose which smacks of Tom Wolfe and is peopled with fascinating vignettes of characters, known and unknown: from Presidents James Bryant Conant, Clark Kerr, and Kingman Brewster to Henry Chauncy, \\"Inky\\" Clark, and Molly Munger, just to name a few. Lemann's thesis is essentially one of good intentions gone painfully awry. The Ivy League and other highly selective colleges have been debrided of old families and old money, only to be replaced by the narrowly proficient and unduly ambitious. It's not a pretty picture and one wants to believe it less important than Lemann and many applicants and their parents think. Much of the book appeared in a series of articles in the New Yorker and, unfortunately, is not much better than the sum of its parts. But I still heartily recommend this book.

Ron Susskind has written an exhaustively researched and lyrically powerful book of great breadth and subtle profundity.  After four years of at least intermittent research, he has captured the internal essence and the external behavior of a cast of at least twelve different characters, the most important of whom is our hero, Cedrick Jennings, but which also includes his mother, his preacher, his father, and some of his friends and acquaintances at Ballou High School and then at Brown.  Just the description of Jennings' afternoon with Justice Clarence Thomas or his interactions with the sixties radical Bernadine Dohrn and her son Zayd are worth the price of the book!  More important, though, is Susskind's graphic description of the devastating chasm which separates the black ghetto kid and his world from that of the privileged Ivy League, a chasm which affirmative action only belatedly and inadequately begins to address.	2003-06-24

As told by White, it is a rather superficial, though intimate, personal outline of Roberts' life--the difficult time she had growing up, her ill-fated marriage, her strength and ambition in the face of adversity.  I came away from the book admiring Roberts for her courage and determination, and appalled at Texaco's corporate culture, its hierarchy and unforgiveable prejudice.

But it is no more than a &quot;war story,&quot; and would have benefited from better editing and been more widely and profitably read as a magazine article.  To deserve a book, the author should have reflected on the wisdom of the law which he practices, not only on behalf of plaintiffs but defendants as well.  Why should those over 40 deserve the same protection as those who suffer racial, gender, or handicap discrimination?  All of us grow old, and while that may not be fair and may affect each of us in different ways, can we as a society want or afford to be swamped with litigation and all its attendant stress and cost to argue the issue in a myriad of cases?  Should the next generation be put on hold in the meanwhile?  Perhaps the only lesson of this book is that Head Coach Davie must not have worn a helmet in his playing days.  Otherwise, he would never have made any reference to age, but fired the plaintiff without explanation, or by simply saying that he wanted to hire his own coaching assistants.	2002-10-25

Published in the same year but pre-dating 9/11, Kinzer may be forgiven his oft-repeated pat prescriptions for a more open democracy, unfettered by the military and considerations of national security.  Kinzer's volume remains a very informative and well-written, if impressionistic, guide to much of the modern history, politics, and social life of Turkey and issues  raised by the Kermalsts, the Islamc fundamentalists, the military, the Kurds, the Armenians, and Greeks.  Along the way, Kinzer warmly introduces the reader to individual Turks and their way of life, marriage customs, raki, nargile salons and much more.  It's only too bad that this relatively slim volume of 240 pages was not enlarged to deal with such important issues as the constraints of an outmoded educational system, the impact of inflation and political corruption, and the challenge of economic development in the context of the European Un&yacute;on.

Unfortunately, he never made it.  Barrett, his Harvard Law School roommate, tells Mungin's story with remarkable insight and sympathy.  In truth, Mungin was a less than distinguished law student, a less than enthusiastic lawyer, and a less than happily adjusted person.  Yet given his abilities and credentials, it is hard to believe that Mungin would not have made partner at one of the four firms he tried, had he not been black.  That is what an entirely black jury in the District of Columbia concluded in awarding him 2.5 million dollars. And yet the racism at Mungin's last firm was subtle and unintended.  Mungin should have further persisted if the brass ring was all that counted. Are we as a society to award compensation to everyone who fails to reach their highest ambition when--as JFK found it so easy to say--\\"life is not fair?\\"  The court of appeals decided otherwise.  To my mind, Barrett has, perhaps unintentionally, very powerfully illustrated why.	2002-02-27

If you want a gripping, beautifully written, quick read which chronicles as monstrous a series of crimes and deceptions as one could imagine, this is your book! It is subtle and penetrating in its description of the impact such conduct had on the perpetrator's best friend and on the author. It unsettles the reader who must realize that we all have tendencies and delusions. And yet, given that the author was in communication with the perpetrator, would it not have been more satisfying if there had been a broader and deeper examination of the well-springs of the perpetrator's behavior? Why was his character so malformed? How could there have been such ignorance or indifference as to his circumstances along the way? Wouldn't his parents have expected, for example, to attend the perpetrator's graduation from medical school--which never occurred--or his wife to know the whereabouts of his internships, his workaday friendships, etc. I think the key to this story is not to be found in the perpetrator but in his environment--an area which the author unfortunately did not take the time or have the interest to explore.	2001-09-08

The reader should be familiar with the &quot;The Hedgehog and the Fox,&quot; if not some of Berlin's other essays, and have heard at least one of Berlin's BBC broadcasts. Ignatieff can do little more than allude to these as he traces Berlin's complicated relationship to his Russian homeland, to England, to Zionism, to the United States and with his wide circle of friendship with the best and the brightest that each of them had to offer. Why is this book such a pleasure? I think it a combination of Ignatieff's felicitous style and compendious research, together with Berlin's wise observations, his humor, and, above all, his remarkable, if self-centered, modesty.	2001-08-28

It describes in anecdotal fashion how the new technology (computers, e-mail, the internet, cell phones, etc.) has commercialized, accelerated, and essentially dehumanized our lives.  Reich's own response was to resign as  Secretary of Labor and return to family and academia.  For the rest of us he has tacked on two chapters at the end of the book, suggesting how government might yet improve our lot.  These suggestions are not tied to any of his earlier specifics, and they are so insubstantial as to recall other Clinton initiatives which never took root or have simply been forgotten. Maybe it was too soon for Reich to undertake a more serious, systematic, and statistical examination of the problems which he has described or to explain why he, as Secretary of Labor, could not do more about them.  But then Reich is a tenured professor--he could well have waited to publish without any fear of perishing.	2001-05-20

I read the first customer reviewer (Rothman) with amazement because he has faulted Ellis's writing style as ponderous. I could not disagree more.  This book is a delight from beginning to end--as much for its writing style as for its subtle, if not entirely original, insights.  We are implicitly challenged to reflect on many issues which haunt us to this day: states' rights versus a strong centralized government; foreign intervention versus non-intervention on behalf of human rights; factionalism versus bi-partisanship; affirmative action versus benign neglect; etc., etc.  Among the many virtues of this book is the degree to which it illustrates how blessed we were to have such strong, enlightened, and committed leaders and how  they were empowered, often as much in disagreement as in alliance with one another. Professor Ellis, you have done the historical profession proud!  My congratulations and many thanks.	2001-02-05

The Ghana File	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Bowditch Is Bullish On Ghana	I balked at paying $55 but this book has proved to be a bargain at the price.  Bowditch has successfully distilled--in highly readable and enjoyable fashion--seven years of experience as a publicly financed developer of Ghana's newest national park.  His insights are informed, not only by his impressive academic training (Harvard A.B. 1966; Princeton M.P.A. 1974), but by the obstacles he faced as a white American newcomer and the comparisons he can draw to his earlier endeavors in a number of countries in Asia and, before that, as Maine's Secretary for Economic Development.   Bowditch's enthusiasm for Ghana is heartfelt and contagious.  He gives many good reasons why Ghana is likely to be every bit as competitive in the new Millenium as were the so-called Asian Tigers at the end of the last.  Whether or not Ghana will prove to be an African Lion, Bowditch can be said to be bullish on its prospects.  His famous ancestor and namesake was known as \\"The Practical Navigator\\" of the open seas. This generation's Bowditch may well become the practical navigator for the American investor/entrepreneur, or those just interested in Ghana.  I therefore highly recommend this book!	2000-11-16

White	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Colorful Portrait Of A Man Named White	Hutchinson has written a fascinating contemporary biography of Justice White who is almost unique in his continued insistence on his privacy and personal dignity. Although the author eschews speculation as to White's  family or personal life, one still gets a good sense of the man--his  intelligence, tenacity, and just plain decency. At least as interesting are  the times he lived in, and few lawyers or judges have shared the action and  passion of their times more fully than Justice White--first on the  gridiron, then in the classroom, in the world of affairs, and on the court.  White had his shortcomings as a communicator and legal theorist, as  Hutchinson  aptly illustrates with the oral and written record. But would  that our society had more such self-effacing, dedicated and excellent  lawyers and public servants!	1999-03-26
