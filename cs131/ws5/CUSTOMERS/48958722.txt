It is a well written story about friendship, set in rural China in the nineteenth century.  Lily is now in her eighties and is narrating the story of her life.  She is paired with her laotong or \\"old same\\", Snow Flowers, who is to be her lifelong friend.  The bond of love between them is more heartfelt and stronger than any of their other relationships.  Their bliss, their pain and their heartbreak is at the heart of the novel.<br /><br />It was also interesting to read about the foot binding which took place then.  While it seems so bizarre and foreign to us I cannot help compare it with the strange things we now do, as women, to beautify ourselves, i.e. botox, collagen injections, etc. It all seems to involve some type of pain to ourselves.<br /><br />I loved how this book took us to another place and time.  A truly beautiful story that will surely move you long after you finish the last page.	2005-09-16

This book was also an enjoyable read but lacking a little in the story.  I didn't like the characters as much as I probably should have.  I did however love the writing style.  Her descriptions of the island, and even of Jessie's angst and turmoil were extremely well done.  I felt the pain and sadness and I could almost see the water, the boats and the life on the island.<br /><br />I started out liking Jessie who appeared to be a responsible person having to return to her island home to care for her mother who has injured herself.  While on the island she tries to gain some perspective of her life and what she wants out of it.  Her journey takes her over some very rough terrain and others are hurt in that trek.<br /><br />The story of Jessie's fall...her fall into \\"love\\" happened too quickly for me to really believe.  She brushed off her marriage and child to be with a man she had just met.  It didn't really seem to be believable to me.<br /><br />This story is about a crisis of love and faith and the characters struggle with it.  Overall, a good read.	2005-06-23

I have read most of her books and was enjoying this one based on a family in turmoil.  Kate, a young girl, has a rare form of leukemia and her sister, Anna, was conceived to provide a donor match.  As she grows older, Anna decides to sue her parents so that she can make her own decisions about her body and its use.<br /><br />Picoult raises some good issues.  For example, can parents make medical decisions about another sibling's donor roles? What is ethical?<br /><br />Multiple viewpoints are used in this story so that we are able to see each family member's perspective on things.<br /><br />The sisters, Kate and Anna are the real story here though.  The bond between them, the competition and loyalty, is the highlight of the book.  They are siblings through their genes but are unable to separate from each other to grow into distinct individuals until Anna tries to maintain her independence.<br /><br />The ending however was lacking.  I don't want to spoil the book, but as was pointed out to me in my bookclub, the lawyer, Campbell, would never have been driving based on his medical problem.  It was a contrived ending that completely ruined the story for me.<br /><br />I will read more Picoult books because I like her style but I was disappointed in the end with this one.	2005-06-01

This story is also subtle in style, elegance, and is realistically paced.  It is character driven and I found the writing to be simple yet wonderful.<br /><br />It was interesting to me to read about the immigrant experience and the differences in cultures.  To see Gogol struggling with his identity and trying to fit in was, for me, a reason to turn the page, to keep reading.  He had to learn to accept his name in order to accept himself as a person.<br /><br />A haunting and wonderfully written book. I look forward to her next one.	2005-04-23

She has once again proved herself to be a master storyteller.  She writes such fascinating stories with such wonderful characters and prose.  This is the third book that I've read by her and loved.<br /><br />Rakhi is the central character here along with her mother.  To be honest I didn't really like Rakhi's character at first.  I felt that she never took responsibility for the way her life was going and she chose instead to blame everything on her ex-husband Sonny or her mother.  Rakhi wants to be close to her mother but is unable to because of her mother's refusal to discuss her work and her previous life in India.<br /><br />After her mother is tragically killed Rakhi opens her journals and discovers the truth behind her mother and for the first time in her life, notices her father.<br /><br />It was interesting to see Rakhi grow within herself and her ability to become open and honest with the people in her life.  The developing relationship with her dad was one of the best points in the novel.<br /><br />Divakaruni has created believable characters here.  It was so sad to see that these people had these lives within themselves that they couldn't or didn't share with their loved ones.  Only after terrible loss and tragedy did Rakhi and her father both come to truly discover themselves and their relationship with one another.<br /><br />I would recommend this book highly.	2005-03-29

They had a wartime courtship and perhaps too hastily agreed to marry.  As a young, married couple they have to adjust to each other, a live in mother in law, and small children.<br /><br />The story does jump around in that not every painstaking year of their lives is mapped out.  We instead get a glimpse into the different time periods of their life together.<br /><br />This is a marriage of opposites.  Michael being the quiet, standoffish type and Pauline is the emotional one.  There are many disappointments in this story and I felt much sadness.<br /><br />It is also realistic in its characters.  While I didn't really like any of them, including the children, the story still invoked emotion.  This is a family dealing with an incredible amount of loss and I did feel bad for Pauline who never really got on with her life.<br /><br />An interesting look into the components of a marriage.	2005-03-15

While I have been disappointed with the latest installments of Shreve's books, this one came through.<br /><br />It's a character driven book, told by Nicky, the daughter of Robert Dillon.  These are two people who have experienced much pain and tragedy in their lives. Nicky has lost her mother and her baby sister earlier in an accident.  Her dad is all she has left.  With the discovery in the woods of an abandoned baby, their lives unravel revealing layers that may never have been uncovered or hurts that would have remained buried.<br /><br />I thought it was great that this book, for once, wasn't about adultery. Her themes usually run with broken marriages. I loved Nicky and found myself thinking of her and her story long after I closed the book.<br /><br />The book is well written even though it is from Nicky's point of view. Her fondness for Charlotte, the baby's mother, made me realize how lonely she was for her own mother...the fact that she needed some nurturing from another female, albeit that Charlotte was only a few years older than her. I loved her father and his isolation and mourning made me feel so sad. He must have been so in love with his wife and of course Clara to not be able to get on with his life after their untimely death. He was paralyzed by his grief. His love for his oldest daughter shone through I think on every page. I felt that the ending was also realistic and I hoped that Nicky's dad would maybe get a glimpse of the possibility at a \\"second chance\\".<br /><br />It's funny how a book gets to you. I still want to know more....like how Nicky's life turned out later, did her dad find love again and maybe re-marry? It's a good story when it can make me wonder like that.	2005-03-12

I loved Tara Road and The Scarlet Feather, but found no such affinity for this one.  I, like other reviewers here, found the characters to be stilted and unbelievable.  In the first few pages I was thinking to myself, who reveals this much of themselves to a complete stranger? I just did not believe in the people.

It was because of her experience, her instincts that Wang Lung became the great landowner.  He never could have done it by himself. O-lan was noble and loyal throughout everything he put her through. She was the true jewel in his life.<br /><br />The land symbolized so much power in this novel.  The redemption of the land and the man.

It is set during the Depression era and centres on two sisters, Clara and Nora Callan.  Clara is the wall-flower who stays in the hometown she grew up in and leads what she feels is a fairly conservative lifestyle. Her life is revealed to us in journal entries and letters to her sister Nora. A horrible event shakes up her life in ways she never knew possible and eventually leads her down roads she felt she would never trod upon.<br /><br />Her sister Nora is leading the glamorous life and becomes very much a socialite in her circles. Her correspondence with her sister shows us that all is not how it appears in her life either.<br /><br />This book was a pure pleasure to read. The ability to find extraordinary in the ordinary and often mundane things in life shows the true talent of this author.  I felt a connection to Clara Callan and was sad to see the story end.	2004-10-03

Isabelle is a tragic heroine and I wanted to learn more about her and her situation. Ella's story, while less tragic certainly, entertained me but did not grasp me. I felt distant from her somehow. I think she created her own problems and then looked for others to solve them.<br /><br />I would have preferred a better ending as well.

I do think miracles can happen, they're usually on a smaller scale though and the average person just happens to miss them. Either way, the premise of the story was a good one but for me it also fell flat.<br />The book is written through Reuben's point of view and we are able to see all of the tragedies that happen through his eyes.  As a result of this, I would assume that the miracles we are told about are as Reuben himself sees them.  It may not actually be what is going on around him, but how he perceives it. I think that his character is the only true one in the novel. He has good qualities and flaws but it is through Reuben that we see the good in everyone. He is the one who still believes in miracles.<br />The other characters in the book just did not come together for me. I felt that we had no true insight into Davy's character at all.  Even the ending was a disappointment to me.	2004-07-08

I liked that the story was told from six different points of view as the reader was able to delve into the character's thoughts and reasons for their actions.<br />The family itself is going through its own changes.  The matriarch of the family, Catherine, is the glue that holds the family together. She has been a strict guardian for the family and is now failing healthwise.  It is during this time that she discovers that maybe she could have done things differently; life is for the living, enjoy your family while you still can.  We are able to see Catherine as a real person through the frequent flashbacks.  She is a woman who has survived a great deal.<br />Her own children and grandchildren, most notably Gracie and Lila are suffering their own setbacks on the road of life.  Gracie is a bit of a lost soul, finding her worthiness only in the arms of men.  When she discovers that she is pregnant, her life is turned upside down.  Lila is the &quot;smart&quot; one, she is in medical school but feels that it is not her true calling in life.  She is disappointed in herself in a number of ways and when she finds someone she can be herself with and possibly love, she attempts to turn away having felt isolated for so long.<br />Each member of this family is undergoing their own transformation.  Each is on their own path to find themselves and to discover what it is that really makes them happy.  Unfortunately, since they are not a close knit family they cannot confide in each other.  They are uncomfortable amongst their kin and have no idea how to communicate with one another.  Fortunately, Catherine's presence and attention to this fact and Gracie's pregnancy may turn this family around.  The baby, not yet even born, may be the link to uniting a family that has been so far divided.	2004-07-05

This story revolves around Jane, Lucy, Deirdre and Matt....and of course the lake. It seems to take on a character of its own. Jane graduated from a boarding school on Heart Lake and began her subsequent life. Events of her life however lead her back to her alma mater where she teaches Latin. Strange events begin to take place once she is back at the school though. It seems that someone has found a long lost journal and her experiences from the past are being re-enacted by her current students.<br />Jane can only solve this mystery by confronting her past and uncovering the truth of exactly what happened in her senior year on the lake.<br />The story had a few twists and turns, though predictable. I didn't find myself actually liking any of the characters however. There was never any real sense of friendship between Jane, Lucy and Deirdre. I felt like they were all using each other for their own purposes. They seemed to be able to shrug off tragedy at a whim, i.e. someone falls into the ice and drowns and they just pick themselves up, dust themselves off and go back to school! I do not see any real emotion here.<br />The lake itself is described endlessly. While it does play a pivotal role in the story, I felt the characters needed to be fleshed out more and the lake descriptions curtailed a little more.<br />All in all, just an okay read.	2004-06-02

The lines between friendship and duty are sometimes blurred for Amir and later it is an act of betrayal that eventually consumes Amir and causes him so much pain in his life. We witness his fears, insecurities and guilt and the internal struggle to do what is right.<br />It is truly a story of betrayal and redemption with family loyalties at stake, hidden family secrets and childhood friendship borne of innocence and doomed by one single act.<br />The storyline of this book will stay with you, haunt you. It opened my heart and my mind. The depth of sadness and humanity is felt within the first few pages.<br />The author is able to make us feel what living in Afghanistan was like before the Soviets took over and before the Taliban began its reign of terror.

I loved her first book, Fall on your Knees.  I do not think that this one was as good as her previous one however.  Her storytelling in the first one was phenomenal.<br />This book is an intense drama taking place in the sixties at a base in Ontario at the height of the Cold War and the space race.  The story revolves around the families at the base, most notably that of Jack McCarthy and his family. The story is mostly told through Madeline's point of view as a child and later as an adult. Though it is a dark story, Madeline is able to convey some houmor throughout and still make us feel such sorrow for her shattered innocence.<br />MacDonald looks into the subject of politics, justice, molestation and many others. She has the ability to understand all of these things and write about them in an amazing way.<br />It is a fascinating story and at the end the reader has to reconsider the fact that the past is not always what it seems.

I usually shy away from any type of sci-fi reading but this one did stand out.<br />While I found the time shifting a little confusing at the beginning of the book, I quickly adjusted.  The author did a great job of sequencing the story and allowed us to witness the growth of each character.  I love that we were able to see Henry and Clare's first encounter, their &quot;dates&quot;, their marriage and the rest of their lives.  Both characters are highly engaging. I found myself waiting with Clare for Henry's return and running with Henry.<br />The writing is beautiful at times and jarring at others.

When Sudha arrives in the U.S. and lives with Anju and Sunil, old wounds are reopened and new passions flare.<br />How all three characters grow and learn makes this story worthwhile.<br />The writing is beautiful, almost lyrical.<br />A must read.	2004-01-04

I enjoyed this one more. It is a love story, one of longing and loss but ultimately at its core, there is love.  The political upheaval and its religious implications are also detailed in this story along with the art movement at that time.<br />The central character is Alessandra, a head strong, passionate young girl who lives to paint and has many conflicts with her well to do family in trying to get on with her life.  Her world unravels even further when a young painter, hired by her father, arrives to paint the frescoes in the family's chapel.  Alessandra is forced to make choices which will forever alter her life, sometimes for the worse, but hoping still for the better.<br />This is a wonderfully written novel and fans of &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; will probably enjoy this story as well. I know I did.	2003-11-11

I was a little hesitant about beginning this book based on its size but I wasn't disappointed.  It is truly an epic tale concerning family and love.<br />It centres around Dominick Birdsey and his twin brother, Thomas. Each brother has his own problems to confront and overcome.  In doing so however we are given a glimpse of life into the past several generations and times.  Some of the events are uncomfortable to read but through them we are able to see so much more of the character's personality.<br />Wally Lamb is able to give us descriptive narrative and dialogue as well as terrific characterization.  So many people in this novel were terribly flawed, but in hard times showed great strength.<br />The lesson learned is that we need to forgive and that forgiveness has to extend to ourselves.  Things happen in life at random and we must learn from them and grow.	2003-11-10

I had high hopes for this one, but it didn't meet that expectation.<br />I enjoyed O'Farrell's journey through Lily's mind and how she felt in her relationship with Marcus.  Her obsession with Sinead was also interesting but none of the characters felt real to me.  Lily's leap into a love affair with a man she knows nothing about just seemed a little strange and his avoidance of every question regarding his previous relationship only compounded the evidence of the fact that he was and still is deceptive.<br />While wondering about a significant other's past relationships is natural, I think that Lily took her curiosity to the extreme at times, even tricking her subconscious into believing things that were not true.<br />A good piece of fiction, but I would recommend her other novel before this one.	2003-10-05

Sally and Clare met as young girls, full of zest for life with some interesting insights into the world.  However they never seem to fully realize their potential or even make any real changes in their life.<br />Clare is the physician who goes from man to man without ever figuring out what it is she really wants in a spouse.  At a young age she idolizes Sally's family and even as an adult never gets to know her own family members.<br />Sally lives in her own world.  She never learns until much later in life what her father really made his money in, she cannot face her brother's downward spiral into drug abuse and instead of helping him she furthers his substance abuse.  She never learns how to be happy, she has no idea how to look after herself.  She went from looking after her brother to caring for a brood of children with a husband who has no interest in her.<br />I enjoyed this book at the very beginning but somewhere around the middle it went haywire.  There were too many conflicts thrown at the characters and they just never learned from any of it.  I couldn't feel sympathy or empathy for any of the people in this book. Without that, the story fell flat.	2003-08-06

The characters of Rose and Maggie were well drawn out but I couldn't find myself relating to either of them really.  I have to say that while I understand why Maggie was portrayed the way she was in the first part of the book, I just couldn't see her changing her ways that drastically. I didn't like her character at all. She didn't come across as realistic.  Rose was an okay persona but again, not entirely believable.<br />While I enjoyed parts of this book, I skimmed others. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the grandmother and stepmother theme were a little over the top.  It just didn't fit.<br />I will look for future books by this author, but I was glad that I didn't pay for this one.	2003-05-22

It is a fictional account of the life and times of the monarchy during the reign of Henry VIII.<br />Anne is power hungry and beautiful but her true character, as revealed by Ms. Gregory, portrays a woman who is willing to do anything to be Queen, an ugly interior masked by a pretty face. As we all know, her quest for this power cost her everything in the end.<br />Mary is the softer side of this family.  She comes across as more or less innocent in the ways of the court and eventually decides to follow her own heart instead of the path intended for her by her incredibly controlling family.<br />The rivalry between the sisters is felt continuously throughout the story.  The parents and the girls uncle use the sisters for their own greed in their constant seeking of social stature and of course, political gain.  The treatment and the role of women in this society is well written about here. The story telling and characterization are superb.<br />Read this book, you will not be disappointed.	2003-05-15

I don't want to give any of the storyline away but she does raise some interesting questions in this book regarding the issue of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; and just how far a parent will go for their child.<br />The writing style was wonderful and I am always impressed with the way that this author can draw you into a story.  I felt that some things in this novel did not ring true however and the characterization was not up to par.  Overall, an enjoyable book. Her previous works have been better however.	2003-04-04

While I enjoyed reading this book, I felt disappointed somehow by its ending. Carrie Bell is narrating the story and we discover that she is suffocating in her life. She is 23 and engaged to her high school sweetheart but the love she felt is no longer there. Unfortunately, her fiance, Mike, is involved in a diving accident and paralysed for life. Carrie has a whole new set of obligations to rise to and consequently her moral dilemma begins.<br />While I do not blame Carrie for leaving behind her hometown and heading out for a life of her own, she could have at least had some closure with her family, friends and most certainly with Mike. She spends her entire time in this book running away which causes the reader to have no real connection with her, we just cannot empathize.  She meets Kilroy while in New York and jumps into a relationship with him.  Then she is torn between her life there and her obligations to the people back at home.  Carrie just cannot make a decision and face the consequences.<br />We want to see Carrie mature and learn something from the choices that she has made, but by the end, I just felt let down. She never had the courage to truly follow her heart. She let others choose for her, even after her courageous move away from home.<br />This book does however raise some interesting questions for ourselves. What would you do in such a situation? Would you choose loyalty over love?<br />Also, the author was able to use some beautiful prose in this book. Her writing ability is wonderful, I just think that the characters themselves were a little unrealistic.	2003-01-09

While others here did not find Will to be the best main character, I enjoyed the fact that he was fallible and not always on top of his game.  I tried to figure out how everyone was linked while reading the story, but soon realized it was pointless to speculate because all of the characters had a secret that needed to be revealed.  Coben has written a thriller that hooks you from the beginning and takes you for a ride. Sit back and hang on.<br />I currently have &quot;Tell No One&quot; on my bedside table to read next.	2003-01-03

While this book is completely different than her first, it is equally as good.<br />The cast of characters in this story evoke varying emotions. Alice is the wise 11 year old daughter who is rebellious and aware of her surroundings. She misses very little and her remarks and sarcasm throughout the book gave the story some well needed comic relief.  Her brother, Boone, while older than Alice, is the innocent one.  He believes in God and truly wants to see the good in everyone. Their stepfather Simon is evil personified and their mother Meg is completely blind to her situation.  She has no idea how to go about protecting herself or her children.  Persely Snow is a well written, complex character.  She is both tough and sweet, allowing only glimpses of her soft side to poke through, most notably when she enters Boone's life.<br />At times this story is hard to read. The psychological terror that Simon imposes on this family is gut wrenching to say the least.  The way in which the story is told however is incredibly well done. Her prose and use of characters is top notch, her ability to build suspense is also first rate.<br />This is a book not to be missed.	2002-11-08

His love interest, Addie, has her own haunting past.  They were probably the most developed characters in the book. I found the teenagers to be a little too superficial, they just didn't come across to me as very realistic.<br />I plan to read more from this author, especially her newer releases.  For one of her better stories with a courtroom drama, try reading The Pact. It won't disappoint.	2002-10-26

The descriptions of the land and encompassing environment is both stark and beautiful.  The author has demonstrated her ability to tie the surroundings in with her characters and plot. Both are reliant upon each other.<br />The story is narrated by Kate, the second youngest in a family that has just learned that their parents have been killed and they are now orphans, struggling to stay together and exist as a family.  Through this storyline the author is able to reveal the true nature of family relationships and ones expectations on certain outcomes.  Unfortunately, as Kate learns, things are not always as they appear.<br />By way of vivid characterization of all the siblings, Luke, Matt, Bo and of course Kate, the reader is able to fully capture the reality of their situation and how the past and present often collide with one another.<br />This was a wonderful read for me.

I am a huge fan of Ms. Picoult's work but her first novel, while good, didn't win me over like her other works of fiction.<br />I liked the idea of writing the story from five different points of view but unfortunately parts of the book became repetitive.  While we did get to know the characters very well and were able to understand why they acted the way they did, I found parts of the book a little confusing.  Having Rebecca's character tell the story backwards took away from the ending. I knew what was going to happen.<br />Jodi does come through however in her beautiful and lyrical writing.  She has a way of conveying a feeling that is both touching and honest.<br />While this book is not my favorite by this author, I will continue to read her novels.  Her work only got better from here.

Though little was known about Mary Saunders, Donoghue certainly brings her to life in this book.<br />The story is set in 18th century London where a young girl, Mary, makes one desperate decision that alters her life forever.  A simple desire, one red ribbon, leads her down the road of darkness.  Mary had a desire for beautiful things in her life but there wasn't much beauty to be found in this story.  It is raw with realism and brutal in its descriptions.  The author does not glorify the life of a prostitute.  It is presented to us in all of its ugliness and is at times uncomfortable to read.  This is the sign of remarkable writing. I was taken from my quiet life and placed in a time where horrendous things happened to young women at every turn.<br />I wanted to despise Mary, but I found myself sympathizing with her.  Life was hard back then, and especially so for a young girl left to the street.  Her dissatisfaction with her life was her greatest obstacle.  To her, being a servant was no better than being a prostitute.  In the end, her own impulsiveness caused her downfall.<br />I had no idea of the ending of this book before I picked it up. I was surprised to say the least.  It was a dark read but worth the time.  I will highly recommend it to others.	2002-09-04

We see the struggle of the mill workers and the impact of such a horrendous economic blow to all of the various social classes.  Honora Beecher is at the centre of the story though the novel is told from 5 different perspectives.<br />Shreve is an outstanding writer in that she uses wonderful, descriptive language and she can explore the human condition and the range of emotions like few other authors.  I enjoyed this part of the book, but the story was a little too slow. I felt that some of the characters just didn't come to life like they could have...Vivian, the jaded socialite especially.<br />Overall, this was a good book, just not her best.	2002-08-26

I realize that it is a fictitious account of her life, but it made for an interesting read.<br />Set in the 17th century, the story opens with Artemisia having been raped by her father's assistant, Agostino Tassi.  Her father has accused him of this rape and sets into motion a trial that will continue to haunt Artemisia for the rest of her days.  The rapist is released and Artemisia, her reputation ruined, is forced into an arranged marriage.<br />She begins to paint her collection, most notably her \\"Judith\\" collection.  Her art becomes famous with the most renowned people of her day.  She portrays the women in her paintings as strong and independent, retribution being the key.  I found Vreeland's account of how the paintings came about and why to be extremely interesting.  Artemisia soon becomes the first woman to be accepted into the Academy of Sciences in Florence and this causes a rift in her marriage.<br />The people along the way are also wonderful characters brought to life, especially Graziela who is wise beyond her years and helps to put things into perspective for Artemisia.  Her passion for painting brought her the utmost joy and pain. A lesson not lost on Artemisia.<br />I was so fascinated by Artemisia's story that I looked on the internet for her paintings and was not disappointed.  I discovered a few inconsistencies in the story and the real life of this painter, but overall I think the book is worth the read.<br />Another book similar in theme to this one is Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier.	2002-08-15

It is at the grill where we meet Miles Roby, his daughter Tick, his brother David, his ex-wife Janine and his father Max...along with a colorful set of other people who frequent the restaurant.<br />Russo manages to tell this superb story through flashbacks and incredible characterization.  It is a poignant and truly funny book which shows the nature of human folly.  Every person we encounter has regrets, they've all made decisions and compromised themselves in one way or another.  Their lives are all intertwined and we are taken on a journey filled with twists and turns that lead us to a true exploration of the human condition.<br />This was such an easy book to lose yourself in, at times I felt like I was in the grill, listening in on the conversations. The people of Empire Falls became real to me and I was sad to see them go.	2002-08-08

His wife Alex is a complicated woman who we discover has a very interesting yet horrible past.  Their daughter Hana is closest to her mother and has to learn some great hardships in life throughout this novel.<br />Alex has gone to a retreat or so Dan thinks.

Dan tries to get her back from the cult's grasp but soon comes to the realization that they are too powerful a group for him to be able to free his wife.  He joins forces with an individual trained in getting cult members out.  This actually works but Alex is already brain washed and it is too late.  Dan has to start his life without her and raise his daughter alone.<br />Unfortunately, Dan has to resort to more drastic measures when the cult kidnaps Hana.  He has to infiltrate the group and try to free himself, Alex and Hana.<br />I found the story lost its credibility when I got to this section of the book...<br />The story had potential but there were almost too many cult facts thrown in and the character of Laura just didn't come across as real...<br />I have read other Darian North novels, this one just wasn't his best.	2002-07-19

Matt has walked out on his lover, Katie.  She holds a secret he doesn't know about and he has his own secrets to divulge.  Matt sends Katie a diary, the complete story of his former life and the wife and son he has cherished.  We see two women who have led parallel lives. The story moves from Katie and her heartbreak to the love and loss in the diary.<br />While I did figure out the ending before I got to it, the book still struck a chord for me.  The romance was a little over the top but I did enjoy the &quot;5 ball&quot; theory of life and it was a gentle reminder to live each day as if it were your last.<br />I enjoyed the book.

There are numerous tensions already existing in the household and Griet adds to them.  The mother in law there, Maria Thins, knows that Griet is special and feels the trouble brewing.  What good can possibly come of a painter/master of a house and the maid who works there? To him she became more than just a servant.  She assisted him with his work and he taught his vision of the world to her.  To watch Griet's character grow and come to life is the best part of this book.  Her perceptions of things are wonderfully written.<br />Tracy Chevalier is a truly talented author.  Her look into the life of the working class versus the well-off, the religious differences that were so apparent at that time and the social injustices is what makes this novel shine.	2002-07-04

After her disappearance the entire family fell apart, unraveled. Now they are trying to piece together the puzzle and return the family to some semblance of normality.<br />Pilot is the most interesting character.  The story is told through his eyes and the fact that he is omniscient is chilling. We see things from his perspective, even when he isn't really there.  He is also schizophrenic.  We are inside his mind throughout this story so we're constantly wondering if we're seeing and hearing the truth or just his version of it.  Pilot is adamant that his brother Eric, the neurosurgeon, is the killer...or is he?<br />Psychologist Katherine DeQuincey-Joy steps into the picture to uncover the dark family secrets and pull Pilot from his psychosis.  She is a fascinating character with her own problems to solve.<br />This is a wonderful, fast paced, intensely written novel.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.	2002-06-28

This one is no exception.<br />She introduces us to Cath and her grandmother Georgia.  Cath is a twice divorced mother who has inherited her grandmother's home and decides to go there to sort things out in her life.  She discovers her grandmother's diaries and we get a glimpse into her life and times.  The story on TB and the stay at the san was really well done.  I did feel like I knew Georgia's character better than Cath's though.  I enjoyed the flashbacks and the development of the characters.<br />An enjoyable book. Worth the read.	2002-06-20

The story did sound intriguing however.  It is a narrative/memoir of Sophy Chase's search for answers, in both the cause of her almost ex-husband's death, and the search for the truth to her own life.<br />Sophy is a struggling writer who has left her husband Will, a CIA agent.  She has a new boyfriend/lover named Daniel but it becomes painfully obvious that their relationship is simply a physical one.  There doesn't seem to be much love between them. She is with Daniel when she gets a call that Will is dead.  She is on the next flight to Swansea to confront her past and figure out her future.<br />On the island there is a mix of characters, an ex-lover who is a famous lawyer, his wife, Sophy's step-daughters and Will's ex-wife just to name a few.  Everyone is waiting to hear the report of Will's death, which was possibly suicide, and Sophy carries an enormous amount of guilt around with her.<br />Throughout all of this, there is much foreshadowing and many subplots.  Unfortunately, there just aren't enough answers.  I don't have to have everything clued up at the end of a book but this one had too many loose ends. It's a comedy of errors.  I liked the suspense angle of the story, but again, not enough was adequately revealed.<br />The writing was well done and the characterization was excellent but the story just didn't hold up for me.	2002-06-06

Her mother suffered from Munchausen Syndrome by proxy. This is a disturbing mental illness that affects all of the family, especially Indie's sister Lily.  Lily was her mother's shining star growing up which put her in some grave situations as a child and left her scarred to the core.  Indie must return home to the very place where her nightmares began. Her mother is ill and Lily has called Indie to return.  Upon arrival, Indie suspects that Lily may be following in their mother's footsteps and wreaking havoc in her own household now.<br />We are told about the family's plight through a series of flashbacks.  It's almost eerie to read about the mother's behaviour and see it through Indie's eyes as a child.<br />Ms. Greenwood's writing is wonderful and lyrical.  I was captivated by the quality of her style.<br />Indie and Lily's story will stay with me for a long time to come.	2002-05-29

She is left scarred physically and emotionally. Her identity is instantly altered with her appearance.<br />Meet yet another Charlotte...a teenager living in turmoil who is also looking to create a new identity for herself.<br />Both Charlotte's are leading parallel lives, one is learning to live her life over with a new face while the other is learning about love/lust and life for the first time.  They both have to deal with esteem issues in a world obessesed with looks and perception.<br />The elder Charlotte was not a character that I really enjoyed however.  She is cynical and selfish.  She has a life built on lies, she prefers it that way.  She is able to see the shadow selves of other people but we never get to see a clear picture of her. She is an enigma.<br />The character of \\"Z\\" is a frightening one. We are truly in the mind of a terrorist, a chameleon who surfaces in various places and studies the world around him.<br />While I found that there was a little too much going on with the plot in this book, Egan does get credit for being a wonderful writer.  She can create amazing images with the touch of a pen.  Her theme of identities, real and artificial, make us wonder about ourselves and those around us. Shadow selves...an interesting concept.	2002-04-30

Mattie and Jake married young due to an unexpected pregnancy.  Jake always felt that he was pressured to do the right thing.  He never truly gave himself to Mattie or their teenage daughter Kim.<br />When Mattie discovers Jake's most recent infidelity she realizes that things have to change.  Jake also wants a change in his life, he has decided to leave his wife and daughter and move in with his girlfriend.  Mattie is ready to move on with her life when she receives the devastating news that she has ALS - Lou Gehrig's disease.  Upon hearing this Jake decides to move back in with Mattie and Kim.  It is then that he discovers that the only true way to find one another and fall in love is to communicate. Jake has had an abusive upbringing, something of which he has told Mattie very little about.  Mattie herself has had to deal with a broken home and a father who walked away.<br />It is during their time together now that Jake realizes his true feelings for Mattie.  He falls in love with her for the first time. Ironically for Mattie, it becomes the best of times and the worst of times.<br />Joy Fielding does a great job of delving into the relationships in this book.  Everyone has their own demons to confront and the family does manage to draw together in their time of crisis.  Unfortunately I was all too aware of the horrible effects of ALS, as a family member has recently passed away with this.  Fielding deals with its consequences realistically.<br />Since reading this book I am anxious to start her newest release.  She has proven herself a wonderful storyteller.	2002-04-12

It is a historial piece that spans 10 years in history intertwining the lives of two families, the Colemans and the Waterhouses.  Kitty Coleman and her husband Richard are more liberal minded (as is evident in the first chapter!) but still obey the social class rules of their society.  Their neighbours, Gertrude and Albert Waterhouse are more conservative and close-minded, both firmly entrenched in the mindset of their era.  Their daughters, Maude and Lavinia, respectively, become friends and are key players in this coming of age story.<br />The author tells the tale through different points of view which I found extremely useful.  Each character's perspective of what was happening was what made this story come alive. To see the varying social class differences, between the servants and cemetary staff as opposed to the elite of society was interesting and a definite eye-opener.<br />There is a little of everything in this book...sex, scandal, betrayal, love, loss and even politics, particularly the education on the suffragette movement in London at that time. It all plays its part in this wonderful novel.<br />I have not yet read her previous novel, A Girl with a Pearl Earring, but I will most definitely look for it now. Any writer who can convey so much heart within one paragraph, containing two lines, towards the end of the book, has proven herself a worthy writer. The style is exceptional.	2002-04-04

She takes an in-depth and humorous look into the lives of Angel and Lina Lupo and their dysfunctional family.  Their parents are Italian immigrants who have come to America with old-world ideals while their daughters want to become true Americans and live fairy tale lives.  As we see in the second half of the book, their dreams have gone awry.  Angel is single, bitter, jealous of her sister's life and anxious to settle down.  Lina is married to a man she doesn't love but pretends to get along with, has two children and is involved in an extramarital affair.  Her life is in a downward spiral.<br />Despite their depressing situations, Ciresi manges to blend in laughter.  Angel's personal ad for example is hilarious. Her descriptions of her parents, her life and her humble beginnings all resonate with humour and realism.  This book is very well written and is completely entertaining, whether you're Italian or not.<br />Another novel to read by Ciresi is Pink Slip.	2002-03-17

I enjoyed this book and the depth to which the author delves in order to allow us to have a glimpse into the life of a Haitian woman.  Sophie is at the heart of this novel and we see her growing up with her aunt, in Haiti, while her mother lives in the U.S.  Suddenly, Sophie is called for, by her mother, and she must go to a country that is foreign to her and live with a woman she doesn't know.  Sophie then learns the truth about her birth and the trauma that her mother has endured for years while at the same time learning to become a woman in her own right.<br />The only flaw I can find in this book is that more character development was needed.  I wanted to learn more about the aunt that raised her and the relationship between Sophie and her mother was never fully examined.<br />The writing however was beautiful and I enjoyed that aspect of it immensely.  Danticat makes each of us realize that family can give us much strength but we need to make the change within ourself in order to become a stronger person.  Sometimes a cycle within a family needs to be broken.  Thankfully Sophie realizes this power and seizes it.<br />Definitely a novel worth the read.	2002-03-10

In the opening scene she boards a train bound for Scotland to see her sisters.  While at the train station she encounters something horrible, something that will leave leave her changed forever.  She returns to London only to be involved in an accident which leaves her in a coma.<br />Through a series of flashbacks we are transported back and forth in time to enter into the lives of Alice, the love of her life~ John, her sisters, her grandmother and of course her mother.<br />The end result is a moving tale that made me laugh at times and cry at others.  I loved the character of Alice, her determination and passion for her soul mate was astounding.  All true love should feel like this.<br />I did not want this book to end. The story, the characters and the writing were all part of the journey.  It was an emotional rollercoaster that I did not want to finish.  Maggie O'Farrell is an author to look for.

It begins at a writer's convention where Linda Fallon and Thomas Janes reunite after many years.  Their love affair has been a consuming one, bordering on obsession.  Their story is told in three parts.  The first being at the convention with both Linda and Thomas in their 50's, one is a widow, one is divorced.  The second part is told when they are in their thirties in Kenya. It was also the best part of the book for me.  The writing here is beautiful.  The last part of the book is their earlier years, their adolescent years.  It is when Linda and Thomas first meet and their fate is determined.<br />Shreve writes a complex story centered on flashbacks and very little dialogue.  It is however beautifully written, luminous even.  This is a story of longing and love.  It explores the depths of love and how it can change a person forever.<br />Despite the writing however, I have to agree with so many other people...the ending left me feeling cheated.  I did not expect a nice happy ending, Shreve never ends her books that way.  I did however expect something...there were too many loose ends and it left me confused as to so much.<br />This is a book that you'll either love or hate.  I'm somewhere in the middle.  I gave it three stars for the excellent writing. She can definitely evoke a lot of emotion in the reader.	2002-02-24

We see their struggle against horrific circumstances and their ability to persevere with courage and spirit.  These people are tough, mentally...their capacity for survival is unforgettable.  Ishvar's character was amazing.  Despite their hardship he never gave up hope, his good manners nor did he forget the meaning of gratitude.

Ann Lord is a woman at the end of her life.  She is bedridden with cancer and through her pain and drug induced sleep we are allowed into her mind and her memories.  Ann has had a full life with several husbands and five children.  Throughout it all she feels that a piece of her is missing.  Her heart was given to a man she met at a friend's wedding many years before.  For Ann, he was her soul mate.  She is devastated and broken hearted when the truth of his situation is revealed to her.  She carries on with her life but is never the same.  She is emotionally crippled for life.  This is obvious in her other memories when she really doesn't come across as a truly loving mother or wife.<br />The stream of consciousness manner in which Ann's story is told is confusing at times but well worth the effort.  The writing is beautiful and evokes much emotion in the reader.  I found it almost heart wrenching to even read.  I truly felt for this character.  So many of us live with the memory of the one that got away...for Ann it was all consuming.

Swick has written a tough story about a 9 year old, Teddy, who has accidentally shot his half-sister, Trina.  It is a gripping novel and one that is hard to read considering the subject matter.  She has done a great job however in her portrayal of the characters.  Giselle is the mother of both Teddy and Trina.  Dan, her second husband, is Trina's father.  The book deals with the theme of tragedy and how everyone grieves differently.  Dan blames his stepson for his daughter's death and cannot move past this.  He uses self-help books and therapy groups to ease his pain while Giselle self-medicates with alcohol and sleeping pills.<br />Teddy is the character who stands out on his own.  He knows that everyone, whether they admit it or not, blames him.  He is a young boy who has to endure a tragedy and loss that no one should have to deal with.  We watch his struggle to come to terms with his loss and the ultimate demise of his family.  Swick has written Teddy's scenes from his own point of view and I found these to be the most haunting.<br />This is a wonderfully written story that deals with an incredibly tough subject.  The debate for gun control will inevitably drag on but I think that this novel shows the tragic results that can occur from a split second incident.  Such pain can only endure a lifetime...and maybe time doesn't heal all wounds.	2001-12-31

It is the consuming story of Eliza, a young Chilean woman, who flees her adoptive home to pursue her first love. Through her eyes we see the rigid social constraints that she would have to deal with if she remained in this home.  Her adoptive mother Rose, while loving and protective, wants to find Eliza a husband, even though she herself adamantly refuses to marry.  Eliza feels that she must find Joaquin who has left for the Gold Rush.  Through her journey to find her love she also finds herself.<br />Tao Chi'en is the other strong character in this novel.  He and Eliza become unlikely allies but their amazing connection to one another makes the story that much more interesting. He also learns things about himself that he didn't expect.<br />This story unfolds from Chile in the 1800's to the California Gold Rush days.  Because of Allende's wonderful writing skills I was able to see the harsh realities of life for so many of the people of that time, especially the women.  The social structure of that era is amazing to read about.  Eliza had to pose as a mute Chinese boy just to survive those times but in doing so it allowed her more freedom than she ever thought possible.  It showed her that she is able to survive on her own and through the disguise she is able to find her own femininity.<br />The only thing that I did not enjoy about the book was the abrupt ending.  I expected a little more I guess after reading in depth so much about each of the characters.  Overall though, a good story.	2001-12-13

His mother Jenny has been killed and Bo is now an orphan.  From here the story continues with both sets of grandparents fighting for custody of Bo.  The white grandparents only want Bo when they come to the realization that there may be some money involved.

They return to March's hometown to attend the funeral of her housekeeper and friend, Mrs. Dale.  Shortly after arriving there March runs into her former boyfriend and first love, Hollis.  After their first encounter in twenty years we see March's life spiral totally out of control.  She is consumed by her passion for this man.  She calls her husband and says she's not returning home to California.  She stops looking after herself, her daughter and her friends.  No one can reach her. Whatever Hollis says is okay with her...she is overtaken by this blind love. March is in a dark place...a relationship where there is violence and bitterness.  She no longer thinks for herself. Her only role is to please Hollis.<br />Alice Hoffman's novel is a story of the darkest side of love...if you can call it that. I found the story to be disturbing and I was hoping that March would wake up and realize what was at stake here both for herself and her daughter. The ending was what I expected but I did find it satisfying. The characters were real and the writing was wonderful. This is my first foray into the world of an Alice Hoffman novel. It won't be my last.	2001-09-28

The rest of the novel takes us through their trials and tribulations of making this business a top notch one. Around them are a long list of characters, some important and some not so important who have their own setbacks to overcome.<br />My favorite characters and by far the funnier ones were Cathy's husband Neil's young cousins ~ Simon and Maud. They are two little imps who start out as impossible to handle and eventually become wise beyond their years. They made me laugh on several occasions throughout the book.<br />I found Scarlet Feather to be a good read but some of the characters were underdeveloped...for instance Neil's sister Amanda who we kept hearing about but never factored into the story. Shona was an interesting character but it seems like her storyline was wrapped up a little too quickly. The other issue in the book that was never really examined was the mystery of the building that Cathy and Tom bought. Apparently it was all very hush hush and both Cathy and Tom tried to find out the circumstances surrounding it but when Tom does finally hear about it, that's the end of it. It's never mentioned again and to me it was never really necessary as part of the plot.<br />In any case, I did enjoy the book and found the main characters to be very likable. Their ups and downs were believable and kept my interest. I am still inclined to hunt down some of Maeve Binchy's older novels and give them a try.	2001-09-19

The story is told through the eyes of Malika Oufkir, the eldest daughter. The family endures such brutal abuse both physically and emotionally that it is miraculous that any of them survive it. Malika and her mother are two of the strongest people I've read about in quite some time. Throughout the ordeal they keep their spirits up for the young children and only cry when no one else can see them. They teach the children several languages, math and most importantly the love of family. They entertain them with stories and plays and remind them of the importance of creativity. When they finally escape their desert jail by digging a tunnel, we see the turmoil that still exists long after they are free of their constraints. This true account really is evidence of the strength of the human spirit to endure and live on. To see such violation of the most basic human rights is a travesty that should always remind us that injustice should never be tolerated. I only hope that Malika and the other members of her family along with Achoura and Halima find the peace that they so deserve. Their courage is moving beyond any words.	2001-09-03

I do love her sense of humour.  From the first chapter she had me hooked...and laughing.  We meet Rachel who is a party girl looking for a good time.  She has no idea that her drug problem is more than just recreational and that she is wreaking havoc on the lives of everyone.  She is whisked off to a rehabilitation centre called the Cloisters and is fighting her drug addiction with every breath.  Denial is her only defense.<br />It is through Rachel's point of view that this story is told.  We see the others in the Cloisters who have come there seeking help and the people in her life that have stayed with her throughout her ordeal.  There are truly some laugh out loud moments in this book and some serious ones as well. It was interesting and yet entertaining to see Rachel go into treatment with one attitude and come out the other side with a new lease on life.

It is a thought provoking story and its words are able to unveil the truth and the essence of what real love is.<br />The book is a series of stories told by varying characters who give us their greatest insight into love and its truest meaning.  All of the people are brought vividly to life, each one being strong and unique in their own right.  While each of the characters' knows how it feels to love, they also learn about the loss of love.  Everyone has felt at some point like one of the characters in this book, we all know the sting of love found and love lost.<br />I would definitely recommend this book.  It's insight into human nature and the effects of love, all different types of love, on the spirit makes for a compelling read.	2001-08-04

This is the fifth book by Jodi Picoult that I've read and I've yet to be disappointed.  Her writing is descriptive and heartfelt, you just love the characters and you absolutely have to find out how it all turns out in the end.<br />The opening moments in the book give the reader the first insight into what is going to happen.  The prologue opens with a woman packing up her husband's things and selling them off. The second part is the euthanasia aspect or mercy killing that is a central theme in the novel.  Mercy, love, betrayal and angst are all intregal parts of the book and Jodi weaves a story that you simply cannot resist.<br />Cam McDonald is the Chief of Police in Wheelock, Massachusetts. He has come to live and work there as part of his family history. It's a part of his identity that he cannot walk away from. Unfortunately, he wishes that his life had turned out differently.

Consequently, she loses a big part of herself because of this. Her entire world revolves around Cameron and his moods. Both husband and wife are on a journey in this book to find themselves and each other.  We follow their joys and sorrows and the bumpy road they have to travel to complete this journey.<br />Jamie McDonald is Cameron's cousin who comes to town after killing his wife.  She has been sick with cancer and she is no longer able to continue the struggle.  She asks Jamie to end her life...he cannot refuse the woman he loves.  The aftermath of this causes Jamie to face a murder trial in Cameron's hometown. The entire town is divided on the issue of mercy killing and we, as readers, begin to form our own opinion on such a moral issue.<br />Mia also enters the picture at the same time as Jamie. She is a lost soul looking for a place to call her own, a place she can call home.  Although she is the character we're supposed to hate in the book, I still felt for this woman.  She fell in love with someone she knew she could never have but in the end she made the right decision. In a way, for me, she redeemed herself.<br />Jodi has again spun her magic. The characters are all easy to relate to and hard to forget. Once the book is closed, the ethical questions of right and wrong will still gnaw at you. Could you forgive the way that Allie must learn to? Could you love the way that Jamie did? Only you can decide.a moral issue. <br />Mia also enters the picture at the same time as Jamie.

They're a wacky duo who have been friends forever.  They've reached the age of thirty and realize that they have some commitment issues and they really need to sort out their lives.  Lisa Jewell takes the characters from one zany episode to the next.  Delilah and Phil, the first loves from Dig and Nadine's past, are also thrown in for comedic effect and place everybody involved in some very funny and touching moments.  As the reader, we know that Dig and Deen are meant for each other, but the journey that we get to see them on makes for some very funny reading.  The ending is how it should be.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and it had some laugh out loud moments.

US	48958722	R23XOQVCV4WB5M	038532362X	337263488	Pink Slip	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Corporate romance in the 80's	This is the first book that I've read by Rita Ciresi, though I know that she's written a few.  I liked this book, in fact it reminded me of Bridget Jones.  Lonely, single, twenty something female who is looking for love and falls for her boss.  I think that this book actually read better than Bridget Jones' Diary though. I found myself laughing out loud at some of her antics and the scene with the blow up security doll was a hoot!<br />Like several other readers however I felt that there were too many subplots.  There was almost too much going on, for example, with her sister and brother-in-law, the whole background history of the holocaust with Eben, her lesbian boss and the story that revolved around her.  While it was all interesting to read, I just don't think that it all came together too well.<br />The story itself centres on Lisa, a corporate employee who is from an Italian Catholic family and how she's looking for love in all of the wrong places.  Her closest ally and confidant is her gay cousin Dodie, who has his own issues and ordeals to face. Lisa falls in love with her straight-laced boss, Eben Strauss.  I just didn't see them as a couple though. Lisa is a very direct individual who has no trouble speaking her mind while Eben is the one who always follows the rules and doesn't like to stray from the norm.  In any case, they begin to see each other and have to find a way to keep it from everyone at work.  Eventually the problems between the two take their toll on the relationship and things go very wrong for everyone involved.<br />I think that the book would have been more interesting and humourous if we had seen more of Lisa and her interactions with her family.  These were some of the best moments in the book. It was entertaining to see Lisa deal with the pull of the inescapable bond with her family and her more modern ideals of what a real 80's woman should be.<br />All in all, an enjoyable summer read.	2001-07-11

I picked this book up at the library and was not disappointed in its progression. While the prologue did not have much to do with the rest of the novel, I feel that its purpose was to set the background for what was to come.<br />The story begins in 1987 when Aaron brings his girlfriend, Suzanne, to his family's home in New Hampshire.  We get a glimpse into his parents relationship, or lack thereof as Jeb really doesn't communicate with anyone. We meet Aaron's brother Jack and their little sister Lila.  There seems to be an ongoing rivalry between the brothers that is never really explained.  Jack is the wild one, he has no fears. He lives on a day to day basis and has no real plans for his future.  Aaron on the other hand is his complete opposite. He plans everything, he's the good looking one with the world at his feet. And yet, despite all of this, he still feels like he has to compete with Jack. Then there is Lila. When we first meet her she is eight years old, but already wise beyond her years. She is doted on by both of her brothers and she is equally in love with them. She loves to be at the centre of their attention.  Only a short time after their arrival, Aaron and Suzanne accompany Jack to a party. It is here that we get a glimpse into what Suzanne really wants...and that is a chance to be with Jack.  The real tragedy occurs later that night, in the woods, by the pond. The forces of jealousy and anger rear their heads and a life is snuffed out. They are three people who have no idea that their actions will have consequences that reverberate for many years to come, especially on the life of a little girl lost...Lila.<br />The rest of the book deals with the issues of obsession and the healing power of redemption.  It is an eerie account of one woman's search for the truth, the truth of what really happened that night by the pond, and the quest to find her true self. It is a moving story of love and loss.<br />I really enjoyed this novel and will definitely look for further books by this acclaimed writer.>I really enjoyed this novel and will definitely look for further books by this acclaimed writer.	2001-07-02

I read this book at the suggestion of a member from my online book club. While I did not care for Ansay's book &quot;Vinegar Hill&quot;, I did enjoy this one.  The story is told from several points of view, all of whom are involved at a wedding.  The entire book takes place in one night and in one locale.<br />April and Caleb are getting hitched, though no one can believe they're actually going to do it considering that they've only been together for three months.  From there we get an insight into April's relationship with her ex boyfriend. It's not a pretty picture though this is not well known to the rest of her family.  We learn of the loneliness that her mother and father both feel, though keep to themselves.  It seems that everyone has a secret to keep, especially the stranger from suite 33 who ends up in the midst of the wedding celebration.<br />Though the writer sprinkles some happy times and funny moments into the story, there is definitely an underlying feeling of turmoil and despair.  From the incident in the hotel suite to the various guests' allowing a glimpse into their own marriages, we get to see alot of different perspectives on the entire constitution of marriage.  The guest list has some quirky characters but all of them come across as very real.  It could definitely be a page out of someone's own real life.<br />Congratulations Ms. Ansay, you won me over!	2001-06-22

Although I like her writing style and her ability to construct a very vivid scene with interesting characters, I felt that this book just fell flat.  It has an air of mystery but I predicted the outcome very early on.<br />Andrew comes back to his hometown for his mother's funeral at the beginning of the book.  From there the story weaves it way back to the past. We find out about Andrew and his childhood friend (and next door neighbour)Eden Close and the relationship that existed between them. We learn that Eden was adored by her father and ignored by her mother. We soon discover that there was more going on in that house and that it all culminates in a murder on a hot summer's night, the night that the beautiful Eden loses her sight.  The mystery is never fully solved and so when Andrew does return home many years later, he feels he cannot leave without finding out the truth about Eden and what happened on that fateful night.<br />It's an okay story but I found it slow to read. It just didn't grab my attention.  I will however continue to read Shreve's other works, I just won't re-read this one.	2001-06-16

This is a beautifully written story about self-doubt, the chance to find yourself, and the bond that exists between a mother and child.<br />The novel begins in the present with Paige locked out of her own house pleading with her husband Nicholas to see their child,Max.  The story continues from there, shifting from Paige's perspective to Nicholas'. We learn that Paige has been abandoned by her mother, then flees from her hometown after dealing with a traumatic incident at a young age. She soon falls in love with Nicholas, a soon to be doctor who's own star is on the rise. Paige is an artist at heart but abandons her own dream to help support the career of her husband. She soon becomes a mother herself and tries to be a loving one but doubts her ability to do so.  She carries the burden of her mother's desertion. In order to stand on her own she has to go back to her past, to the mother who left her. From there she has to learn how to love.<br />This book differs from her others in that there is no mystery to be solved here, there is no court room scenes. There is just the tender story of two people, two souls that are meant to be together, and the journey that their lives take them on. Jodi has an incredible way with words and her storytelling here is absolutely superb. It is a book to be savoured.	2001-06-09

The character of Denise as the strong, independent single mother to Kyle was one of the best qualities of the novel. I was moved by the strength of her love for her child and the fact that she had pretty much given up her life to help him overcome his learning and speech disability.<br />I also liked Taylor's character and the fact that the author didn't give us the full details of why this character behaved the way he did. We knew that his father died at a young age but not the events leading up to that death. It was interesting to see them unfold.<br />The relationship between Taylor and Denise was predictable but I like a good love story!<br />Though I enjoyed this book, I would have to say that I thought his earlier novel, &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; was by far the better story.	2001-05-29

When she finds out that her husband is cheating on her again, she decides to get even! After a wild romp with C.L., a guy she once dated in high school, things begin to unravel and tongues begin to wag in Frog Point.  It is definitely a scathing look at the character of people in a small town and the stigma of family ties. Everyone is concerned with everyone elses business.<br />The book is a light read with some mystery, funny dialogue, and some sexy scenes.  The only thing I didn't really enjoy in the book was the daughter Emily who was only supposed to be eight years old...her thoughts and actions seemed to reflect someone much older than that.<br />A good fun read though overall.	2001-05-24
