Bears are warm friends that will become heirlooms, passed down from generation to generation.<br />With this book, you'll learn how to make a variety of bears. First, the &quot;bear essentials&quot;: how to choose the fabric, lay out, cut, stuff, sew, embellish, make movable arms and legs, add eyes and paws -- even change the expressions, from shy to adventurous.<BR>Then the hard part: deciding which bear to make first. There are ten bears in all, including three white polar bears and a snuggly panda. They come in all sizes, from small friends that can be tucked into a jacket pocke, to large bears that will wait patiently to be loved each night.<br />You can use a variety of fabrics to make the bears, from terry cloth to fake fur to flannel, and the bears can be made into any color -- brown, yellow, black or gray.<br />This book includes all the necessary pattern pieces for each bear, each with seam allowances shown. Nine of the patterns are full-sized, so there's no need to enlarge each pattern piece. In addition, there are fabric layouts and, of course, step-by-step instructions for each and every bear.<br />But bears are only half the fun. Besides stuffed bears, the book includes another nine bear projects, including a warm scarf and mitten ensemble, a kid's backpack that is sure to be the envy of the schoolyard, a useful clothes rack, a wonderful bear rug, a soft cushion, and a charming bear purse.<br />There's enough variety in this book to allow you to make a bear for everyone on your list -- whether it's a special present for a favorite child or a gift to warm the heart of the family curmudgeon.	2004-05-29

The growth of Salem is traced frm 1626 to 1932 against the state and national scene. The author traces the history of witchcraft from 1484, when a Papal decree made it a crime, to Salem's participation in the mass madness. The book covers the Quaker whippings, the military disaster of King Philip's war for Indian and white survival, the privateering years in which Salem became so great a sea power that Salem meant America in exotic ports of the world.<br />Comprehensive in scope, the book is authenticated by leading scholars in America and England, contains bibliography, index, addenda, and is illustrated with twenty-eight selections from the Essex Collections.	2004-05-28

Stevenson	This invaluable book focuses upon Stevenson the public man, the man with whom history will be concerned. A forceful and penetrating narrative, it performs the essential service of separating the man from the legend.<br />For example: We learn here how sporadic and meager was the out-of-state coverage -- even The New York Times' coverage -- of Stevenson's administration as Governor of Illinois. And then, reading the record, we learn how remarkable that administration was. Thus, doubts are raised as to the absolute validity of the cliche which stipulates that he was a greater candidate than he would have been a President.<br />Or again: Reading how totally and unequivocally Stevenson twice turned down President Truman's plea to accept the nomination -- at a time when the wise money assumed that Taft, a not-too-difficult man to beat, would be the Republican candidate -- we find that the perennial epithet &quot;indecisive&quot; is less than one hundred percent accurate. This bothered Stevenson himself: &quot;The more decided I am,&quot; he said, &quot;the more they accuse me of being indecisive.&quot;<br />Comparable instances of precise information contradicting popular assumptions turn up throughout this portrait-in-depth, sometimes in the testimony of contemporaries, sometimes in Times news stories and columns, and sometimes in Stevenson's own words. Many of the greaest passages of his greatest speeches are here, in their original context of time and place. Thus, they regain a pertinence and power that are lost when they are separated from the setting and circumstances which called them forth.<br />PORTRAIT reveals most compellingly a man for his time: Adlai E. Stevenson, international statesman on the truest sense, source of inspiration for many Americans.	2004-05-28

The course of thought in America can be traced though its relation, near or remote, to religious and ethical controls. It is a line that passes through the dominance of religious faith and ethical precept in the seventeenth century, the challenge to the altar by the shop till and the flag in the eighteenth century, the challenge of the nineteenth century to the flag by the treasure vault and the machines it served, the twentieth-century breakdown of the money-changers after their capture of flag and machine and altar. And according to the weight of present evidence, as I see it, among both populace and intellectual leaders, something invincibly American is making frest estimates as to the things that are desirable and praiseworthy and is facing the future perhaps with less confidence but with unshaken hope.<br />In following this line of thought I have tried to deal scrupulously with the writers and writings passed in review and to avoid forcing a thesis. I am sure that there are many other factors in American literature, many other illuminating approaches; and I have tried to indicate their places and proportions. Fortunately for the readers of literary history the chief documents are easily available to anyone who will stop running long enough to read.<br />It is impossible to make due and explicit acknowledgment to all who have helped toward this formulation. I have thanked them one by one, and I thank them together on the dedicatory page.&quot; -- Percy H.

It deserves the wide public that it is likely to attract.&quot;<br />She was Marie Antoinette, a lovely Austrian princess.  She was fourteen when she first met her fifteen-year-old husband, the Dauphin of France.  He was a shy, heavy young man, overshadowed by his grandfather, Louis XV.<br />The girl had many problems to cope with at the French court, among them her husband's lack of interest, the King's spinster daughters (almost her only companions at first) and Madame du Barry, the King's favorite.  Yet she soon won everyone's heart and had all of Paris at her charming feet.<br />But as time went by, not only the court but the country as a whole and Marie Antoinette's mother (Maria Theresa of Austria, four hundred leagues away, and constantly advising her daughter by mail) were alarmed by the fantastic parties, wild extravagances, and excessive pleasures of the Dauphin's bride.<br />Then Louis XV died, and the courtiers coming to salute the new nineteen-year-old king found him and his queen on their knees weeping bitterly.  &quot;Oh, God,&quot; they cried, embracing each other, &quot;protect us, we are too young to reign.&quot;<br />Andre Castelot, a distinguished French scholar and historian, has in this book written one of the most brilliant of recent biographies, which makes Marie Antoinette, from her arrival in France to the day she rode to her death in a cart, amazingly alive for the reader.  We are carried from the intimate chambers of the young queen, through the incredible splendor and shocking discomfort of life at Court, to the awesome sounds of the rising mob, the last desperate flights, and the ultimate imprisonment and execution.<br />The author has had a mass of decuments at his disposal while writing this book, many of them newly discovered in Viennese and Parisian archives, and never before presented to the public.<BR>Robert Pick says, &quot;I admire this book immensely.  Familiar with the Marie Antoinette story and its grim climax, I yet found myself in suspense to the last.&quot;	2004-05-15

Then John Farrell's son began to steal, the Wards' boy lied in terror about a fight he had been in at school and a German Luger disappeared from the Detweillers' home.  It became apparent that an ugly and mysterious influence was operating within the peaceful blocks of Faircrest.<br />The adults recognized the danger signals.  It was obvious their children's values and safety were being threatened.  This was a time for calmness, for issues to be clearly defined.  But the parents failed to realize that their own values were also put to test in this explosive situation.  A conviction of righteousness swept through the community like a grass fire, and with it an impatience with the law and a disregard for the rights of anyone beyond the threatened portals of Faircrest.  What man, what individual life is ever strong enough to survive such a spell of riot?<br />Here, in a tense and unusual book, is a sobering picture of what could happen in any modern American community.	2004-05-15

The Time Phantom was an ancient, shriveled figure; it was difficult to make out detail in the fading light, but he seemed to be staring straight at Faulcon as the viewscope peered down upon him, staring from shrunken eyes hidden in massive wrinkles of flesh and twisted facial muscle.  His nose was squat, giving every appearance of having been crushed; it seemed to twitch as if he smelled Faulcon's scrutiny, but this was almost certainly imagination.  His hair was lank, long, grey as ash -- and from this distance seemed filthy; it blew in the breeze.  By way of breathing apparatus, he seemed to wear a corrupted respirator that covered the lower face, held in place only by the pressure of his lips . . . .<br />Kris Dojaan is sure that the Time Phantom is Mark, his brother, lost on Kamelios a year before.  Though Mark was not precisely lost -- stolen, on Kamelios, is a better word to describe the disappearance of the rifters, those workers who come the valleys for artifacts of past and future civilizations.<BR>For Kamelios, with its atmosphere made breathable for unmodified humans only through the use of sealed, movable cities and respirators, poses another threat to its colonists:  the time winds, which scramble chronology in both its geological and historical aspects.  Those who explore the ruins risk being swept off in the winds -- vanishing forever.  Yet Kris feels that if he can enter one freely, he will survive -- riding the winds like the Phantom -- to find his time-lost brother.<br />But jaded by years of experiences and by the effects of the fiersigs -- fields of energy which sweep randomly over the planet causing abrupt emotional changes -- the other rifters feel differently.  Veterans Leo Faulcon and his lover, Lena Tanoway, are given charge of Kris, to protect him from his wild scheme, on orders from Commander Gulio Ensavlion, whose hope for solving Kamelios' riddles lies in communicating with the time-traveling aliens which he alone has glimpsed.<br />Caught in his anticipation of a reunion with Mark, Kris begins to venture into the rift-valleys without the protection of his r-suit, which is equipped with a warning siren and enables the wearer to out-run the wind.  One morning, Lena and Leo find him wandering in the valley, filled with important news.  He has seen the Time Phantom close up, and though the figure is not Mark, the Phantom has told him he can take him to his brother.<br />And then the worst time wind in Kamelios' history begins to blow, taking Lena and Kris with it, leaving Leo behind to find them . . . somehow.	2004-04-08

The mystery surrounding both the Shroud of Turin and the Holy Grail has never failed to excite the imagination and arouse speculation worldwide.<br />Doubts about the authenticity of the Shroud, one of the alleged burial linens of Christ, center on the years 1204 - 1353 when it went &quot;missing&quot; from the pages of history after the sack of Constantinople.  Noel Currer-Briggs has conducted an extensive investigation of those years to reveal how both the Shroud and the Grail passed through a network of noble and royal families into the hands of the Templars, who eventually brought them to France in the mid-thirteenth century.<br />In THE SHROUD AND THE GRAIL the author approaches the subject from a sceptical point of view but presents startling new evidence to link the Shroud of Turin, whose history has been reliably documented  from 1353 to the present, with the Shroud of the Byzantine era.  He examines the controversy surrounding the identity of the Holy Grail and demonstrates how it can be associated with the reliquary casket in which the Shroud was once kept.  He also shows how the Grail has been confused with the Chalice of the Last Supper, and that contrary to popular belief it was in fact widely portrayed un the iconography of the time but often misinterpreted as Christ's coffin.<br />Mr. Currer-Briggs' many years of detective work has resulted in a book that no one interested in the Shroud or Holy Grail can afford to miss.<br />A well-known lecturer and broadcaster in Britain and the United States, Noel Currer-Briggs is a former Chairman and Founder Member of the Association of Genealogists and Record Agents and a Fellow of the Society of Genealogists.	2003-09-28

After studying what makes a serial killer the way he is/was... I had a lot of books on Ted Bundy, but they were only by Chroniclers, men who were journalists, who only wanted to chronicle Ted's crimes as he sat on death row, they never knew him personally... and had made their judgments of his crimes in that manner... they didn't know the OTHER SIDE of Ted Bundy.  Just the person he became sitting on Death Row.<br />This is the first Ann Rule book I bought ever.  She gives insight that other journalists that have \\"talked to bundy on death row\\" have not.  She not only gives insight as a True Crime Writer and friend of every police precinct in Washington, but she also gives insight as a close friend and co-worker (in a Crisis Center) of Ted Bundy.<br />We not only see how Ted was before and after he was caught in 3 states, but also what she thought of him during those times.  She never sensationalize Ted the Monster, nor catered to \\"Poor Boy Ted\\", she just stated what she witnessed of him, and news articles on him.<br />I must admit though, of all the serial killers I have books on from Women Who Kill to Jack Olsen's books... this one... after I was finished reading the last page, I couldn't go to sleep, I was wondering what would I do if someone came through my window, and didn't sleep well at all.   The frightening thing about this book... is... What would you do in Ann's situation if you suspected, and knew there were investigations of serial sex murders on YOUR Best Friend...  a very chilling account of \\"Ted Bundy As I Knew Him\\"-type of book.  I highly recommend this.	2002-12-31

But the glorious music of such operas as Tannhauser, Lohengrin, Tristan and Isolde, and the Ring cycle is by no means Wagner's only legacy to posterity.  The great composer was anxious to leave the world a true portrait of himself; he fully realized that he was a man of amazing ability; he knew that the story of his romantic life would be a subject of endless discussion and would hold the engrossed attention of  all those who longed to gain the fullest understanding and enjoyment of his music.<br />Ernest Newman of the London Times, the most influential music critic on either side of the Atlantic and the author of many widely read books, among them THE STORIES OF THE GREAT OPERAS AND THEIR COMPOSERS, has made an exhaustive study of the vast mass of original Wagnerian manterial and from it he has written this invaluable study of the man and the artist.  It is a story of overwhelming ambition, a story lit with the love of devoted women to whose sympathy their hero was ever susceptible, a story of artistic triumphs, financial failure, and personal passion.<br />A knowledge of Mr. Newman's book will enable you to appreciate, as never before, what lay behind the enduring beauty of Wagner's superlative music -- music which in its passages of turbulent majesty as well as in those of uplifted flight of soul reflects the proud, indomitable spirit of the unbridled genius who composed it.	2002-12-16

He commanded a mighty machine of thought and opinion; he thundered his views around the world -- and the world listened.  For here was a man of mystery, vision and sometimes erratic action.<br />Colonel Robert R. McCormick was one of the most colorful, controversial, successful newspapermen ever known.  But beyond this aura of greatness is an untold story of McCormick as a man.  This book provides for the first time, a full-length biography.<br />Frank C. Waldrop tells this story of Colonel McCormick with skill; probing and pondering the mystery of an unusual man.  Objectively, Waldrop traces McCormick from birth to death, bringing light to some of the unanswered questions about his background.<br />In scores of fresh and revealing anecdotes, a world of fascinating people is introduced -- those who knew McCormick, both his friends and his enemies, from presidents to potentates, from industrial giants to men of the underworld.  Among the personalities who figured in McCormick's life and who are discussed here -- Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, Mark Hanna, Richard Harding Davis, Winston Churchill, George C. Marshall and General John Pershing.  And, the story behind the headlines -- the anti-trust suit against the Associated Press, the Tribune's handling of the Battle of Midway, McCormick's role in the Marshall Field decision to publish a paper, and McCormick's journalistic venture in Washington -- events affecting national politics and journalism -- are fully explored here.<br />Whatever you may know about the life of this extraordinary man, whatever opinions you may now hold, this story will leave you with a better understanding of McCormick the man, and the times in which he moved.	2002-12-16

The true story of Peter Tchaikowsky and Nadejda von Meck has never been told until now.<br />That the wife of a nobleman, a woman who was beautiful, popular, fabulously wealthy -- the mother of eleven children -- for years lavished her attention and practically devoted her entire waking and dreaming existence to a composer whom she never met is, of course, well known.<br />But why she did this -- why during the thirteen years of their friendship they book took extreme measures never to meet -- why she permitted Tchaikowsky to marry another woman -- why she later gave him money to get a divorce -- why Tchaikowsky alternated between the heights of exaltation in his friendship and the deoths of self-abasement and despair -- is an enigma that has never been satisfactorily explained until now.<br />The letters upon which this biography is based were hidden for years in Mme. von Meck's household.  At the outbreak of the Revolution in Russia they were seized by the Bolsheviki; the originals are now in the possession of the Soviet Government, which has refused to release them.<br />But fortunately for the musical world, translations of these letters were made by Barbara von Meck, the granddaughter of Nadejda; and Catherine Drinker Bowen, author of FREE ARTIST, has reconstructed the whole story.<br />It is a strangely moving story, the recounting of a romance that never came to full fruition, but which found its expression in music which has delighted the world with its tragic beauty and its lilting airs.	2002-12-16

The turn-of-the-century scenes are not only dear to his heart but clear to his mind -- albeit sometimes suspiciously so.  But who will quarrel with so elegant a storyteller as Mr. Paul?  Out of the sows ear of common occurrence he makes a silken purse to hold the coins of our enchantment.

It is perhaps the most dramatic account of the sinking of the legendary &quot;unsinkable&quot; Cunard liner -- and of the incredible, science fiction-like finding of the ship.<br />&quot;As ropes were unhooked and boat number fourteen struck out, portholes still glowed below the surface.  From five feet under, in a room that was still unflooded, a man was peering out into the ocean.  Adjacent portholes illumunated the white bottom of a lifeboat.  Looking up, he watched it cast away...&quot;<br />Time seemed to have come unstuck the day the TITANIC's grave was discovered.  An empty lifeboat davit turned up on the robot ARGO's tv screens, and suddenly it was 1912 again, suddenly the horrors came spewing out like a nightmare from the past.  Scientiests burst into tears, and many who saw those first pictures suffered what they later called minor nervous breakdowns.  The world looked on, dumbfounded by the fallibility of man's suppsedly most invincible creations.<br />HER NAME, TITANIC includes a vivid portrait of explorer Robert Ballard, the brilliant leader of the expedition that discovered the TITANIC's remains.  The author portrays Ballard and his crew in a compelling style unlike that of any other book on the subject.  Charles Pellegrino is a scientist as well as an author, and he describes in riveting detail the scientific aspects of the machines and the processes involved in the expeditions.<br />But more than that, this is the first book to go beyond the headlines.  By delving deep into the meaning of the TITANIC, which has evolved slowly from tragedy to symbol, and by putting himself into the minds of the people who play the characters in the drama.  Charles Pellegrino has created a spellbinding work of oceanography that succeeds in illuminating new truths about the meaning of science -- and about the tragedies and joys of the human adventure.	2002-12-04

In a setting reminiscent of cave man days, a strange game of hide- and-seek is played out.  The climax is a wild chase in which Pam emerges the heroine.<br />Pam and Jerry North have given pleasure to hundreds of thousands of mystery fans.  Their latest adventures furnish another example of why the Lockridges, through the years, have attracted so large a following.	2002-11-17

Hughes, It's a MUST	Steve Wintress studied the passengers on the New York to Los Angeles flight carefully.  In his business, one couldn't be too careful.  The pale gold girl beside him -- the niece of a prominent Hollywood director -- might be after the same Davidian Report he was looking for.  So might the overwhelmingly handsome man across the way, whom he recognized as Haig Armour of the Justice Department.  Or even the young and crumpled soldier who didn't look as if he would ever be mixed up in this sort of thing.  Any one of them might be after the secret document -- and Steve had to get there first.<br />When the Communists, the FBI and the CIC are all after the same report -- which had been smuggled out of Berlin by the wily Davidian and was for sale to the highest bidder -- you can expect some fast footwork in the cloak and dagger department.  With the deft touch of an expert, Dorothy Hughes unravels the tangled skein of this story of master sleuths and desperate adventure.<br />THE DAVIDIAN REPORT marks a departure for a  Dorothy B. Hughes mystery; here quiet terror is the lesser ingredient and the suspenseful, spine-tingling spy chase offers the major thrill.  Inevitably the reader will be reminded of the best Eric Ambler and Manning Coles.  But perhaps no other mystery writer has Miss Hughes' unique flair for the bizarre and the incongruous; typical is the passage where two Communists try to make contact amidst the confusion of the Hollywood Santa Claus parade.	2002-11-17

His family and friends begged him to plead insanity.  But he insisted that he was sane, and the doctors agreed with him.<br />Then, as the neighbors muttered about Latimer and began to ostracize him, a body was discovered in the lonely marshlands where Latimer was so fond of walking.<br />Hugh, Latimer's son, and Hugh's fiancee Cynthia set out to prove Latimer's innocence.  The job seemed impossibly hard.  But they were determined.

These reflect not only the man, his cases, and his faithful assistant Dr. Watson, but also the people to whom he is not just a fictious character -- but a criminal investigator to be analyzed, explained, and compared.  A far-ranging collection of such diverse material has been brought together in a unique souvenir of the making of a legend.  Herein the reader will find some of the best, the most illuminating and frequently most amusing items to appear about the famous detective partnership.<br />The contributors include Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, his wife, Lady Conan Doyle, Dorothy L. Sayers, Frank Swinnerton, Edmund Pearson, Wyndham Lewis, Irving Wallace, Ronald Knox, and Christopher Morley.<br />The book will prove a delight to Sherlockian and general reader alike, mirroring as it does one of the most extraordinary literary phenomena of all time.	2002-11-16

The kidnappers following the lady in the Rolls-Royce had confused Muriel McKay with someone else.  When her husband returned home that night he found an open handbag, its contents scattered on the stairway, a telephone on the floor, and the house deserted.  Strange ransom notes and frightening phone calls served only to deepen the mystery.  The search for Mrs. McKay's whereabouts became an agnozing struggle, a race against time to save her from the mysterious figure who identified himself only as M3.<br />2) NEILL CREAM, POISONER<BR>Retold by Elizabeth Jenkins<BR>Dr. Neill Cream was a courtly gentleman, fashionably dreassed.  There was, to be sure, a curious look in his eye; and he seemed to spend more time prowling London by night than practicing medicine by day.  But, as distinguished historian Elizabeth Jenkins recounts, it was not until far too many unsuspecting young women had died quite horribly that Scotland Yard setout to discover just what the mysterious &quot;doctor&quot; was up to.<br />3) THE CASE OF STANLEY SETTY<BR>Retold by Andrew Garve.<BR>It was a dimembered corpse wrapped in a parcel that the duck hunter discovered floating in one of the shallow salt flats along the Essex coast.  Upon examining it, the Yard's forensic experts found a number of stab wounds and announced that it had fallen from a great height, possibly a plane.  But who was it?  Swiftly, methodically, the sleuths of Scotland Yard pieced together a fantastic and hair-raising story.<br />4) THE WEMBLEY JOB<BR>Retold by Winston Graham<BR>It took just ninety seconds for England's slipperiest robbers to make off with a third of a million dollars from a Wembley bank.  It was done with sledgehammers and shotguns; and the identity of the culprits was well concealed.  Still, in justthree months a Scotland Yard robbery squad had broken the case wide open.  The gang known as the Frighteners had met their match.<br />5) THE PORTLAND SPY CASE<BR>Retold by Ludovic Kennedy<BR>Hidden in their house was an incredible array of espionage devices: a high-powered radio station, a false-bottomed cigarette lighter, and concealed microdot messages.  All this and more belonged to Peter and Helen Kroger, Russian trained spies.  Their mission -- to obtain, highly secret weapons information from Britain's Portland Naval Base.  Here is the exciting story of how Scotland Yard tracked the Krogers down and gathered evidence for an airtight case against one of Britain's most notorious spy rings.<br />6) DOCTOR CRIPPENS DIARY<BR>Retold by Emlyn Williams<BR>Dr. Crippen said his wife, Cora, had gone to America.  Later he reported that she had died there.  But, curiously, his secretary, Ethel Le Neve, was seen wearing Mrs. Crippen's jewelry.  What had really happened to Cora Crippen?  An investigation led to a grisly discovery in the basement of the Crippen home, but by then both secretary and doctor were nowhere to be found.  It took Inspector Drew of the Yard to unravel one of the most fiendish crimes of the century.<br />7) THE SHEPHERD'S BUSH CASE<BR>Retold by Russell Braddon<BR>In an act of almost unprecedented violence, three policemen were gunned down in broad daylight just outside of London.  The men of Shepherd's Bush Police Station were determined at all costs to find whoever was responsible for the cold-blooded murders.  Shortly, what was to become one of the longest and most horrowing manhunts in the history of Scotland Yard was under way.<br />8) THE SIEGE OF SIDNEY STREET<BR>Retold by Julian Symons<BR>Sidney Street was suddenly ablaze with a cross fire of bullets as detectives and police attempted the capture of a gang of anarchists who had been cornered in a house there.  Crowds came from miles around, and even Britain's Home Secretary, young Winston Churchill, arrived on the scene, along with the Scots Guards.  Then came the fire brigade, who had rushed there to extinguish the fire burning out of control in the East End tenement where the desperate men were holed up.	2002-11-15

THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION is a story unparalleled in the annals of criminal detection.  Discovered in Hampshire, England, where it had lain neglected since 1939, then painstakingly researched and annotated for two years by editor Nicholas Meyer, THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION marks the first publication of a heretofore unknown and astounding episode in the career of Sherlock Holmes as recorded by his closest friend and chronicler, Dr. John H. Watson.<br />Even more remarkable than the historic discovery of Watson's transcript are the revelations it contains concerning the real identity of the heinous Professor Moriarity, the dark secret shared by Sherlock and brother Mycroft Holmes, and the detective's true whereabouts and activities during the Great Hiatus when the world believed him dead.<br />Most astounding of all, THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION details the events that led to the meeting in Vienna of the world's two most brilliant investigators and their collaboration on a sensational case of diabolic conspiracy.<br />John Hamish Watson was born in England in 1847.  After a childhood spent abroad, he returned in 1872 and enrolled in the University of London Medical School, where he took his degree six years later.  After finishing the course at Netley prescribed for Army surgeons, he was attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and sent to India.  Severly wounded by a Jezail bullet at the Battle of Maiwand during the Second Afghan War, in 1880, he returned to England, his health ruined, with no specific plans other than to live as best he could on his Army pension.  In January of the following year, quite by accident, he met Sherlock Holmes, who was then looking for someone to share his lodgings.  The ensuing friendship, which lasted until Holmes' death found Watson his niche as the great detective's biographer through more than sixty cases.  In his spare time he resumed the practice of medicine.  In 1889 he married Mary Morstan.  He died in Britain in 1940.	2002-11-15

PRESIDENT, and his Pulitzer Prize coverage of the John Kennedy assassination.  The book includes story, tragedy, and humor.	2002-10-21

Ruth McKenney of MY SISTER EILEEN fame and her husband, Richard Bransten, have lived in England for the past three years.  To say that they have fallen in love with that green and pleasant land is putting it mildly.  Theirs is an evangelical passion which they are eager to share with their readers.  The result is the liveliest book about England which has appeared since WITH MALICE TOWARD SOME.<br />HERE'S ENGLAND is aimed squarely at American tourists -- it's replete with history, architecture and practical travel information, but first and foremost it's a book to read for sheer enjoyment.  In the hands of an eloquent novelist like Miss McKenney, history comes alive; the stories of Thomas Becket, Old Sarum and the Wars of the Roses take on color and a contemporary urgency.  All through the book there are passages of lyrical beauty and flashes of humor which are equally delightful.<br />The first section, on London, its sights, its spirit and its people, is followed by seven easily manageable journeys into various sections of England.  They range from Canterbury to Cornwall to the moors of the Border Country, and every one of them has its full quota of excitement and pleased discovery for both tourist and reader.<br />Osbert Lancaster's line drawings are both witty and characteristically distinguished.	2002-10-21

A motion picture based on TENDER MERCY was made.<br />Mr. Kaufman's new book, JUBEL'S CHILDREN, is certain to enhance his reputation even further.  A warm, tender novel, rich with the emotions from which spring true drama, it is a memorable reading experience.  Jubel's Children presents a situation as unusual as it is dramatic -- the story of a father and his four grown children -- children who considered themselves adult, but who still needed the understanding presence of a father to help solve their problems.<br />Jubel Watson had not seen all four of his children together since they had grown up.  Now they were all coming to the funeral of his wife -- their mother.  Waiting in the little Pennsylvania town that had been his home since boyhood, Jubel looked forward eagerly to seeing them again.  He was proud of his children who, he thought, had done so well in the world.  He did not suspect that wach of them was at this very moment worrying about Jubel himself.  Each realized that their father would have to live with one of them, yet each had \\"good reasons\\" why he could not take the responsibility.<br />Bertram, the eldest, was bitter and angry.  After a succession of jobs, he was still barely keeping his head above water.  With a budget that could not be stretched one more point, and with his marriage on the verge of break up, he could not possibly afford to take his father home.<br />Helen, flying down from Boston, shuddered at the thought of taking Jubel back to her apartment.  For Helen had fallen desperately in love with a married man!  Jubel's presence would make impossible the passionate affair that was her only reason for living.<br />Nor could young Jubel take his father.  Hitchhiking from New York, he was flat broke, a hopeful actor out of work, secretly married to a rich girl who was ashamed of him.  He didn't dare tell his father about her.  No, he couldn't do anyting for the old man.<br />And Eve, driving up from Georgia, had only two dollars.  Her children were hungry.  Her shiftless husband's last words to her had been, \\"And don't bring your old man back with you!\\"<br />How these four reluctantly decided to have Jubel visit each of them for three months -- and the amazing changes that his simple, honest, dignified personality made in the lives of each of them -- is the substance of this thoroughly entrancing novel.  In a day when the real values of family living have never been more desperately needed, JUBEL'S CHILDREN offers an inspiring story you will remember long after you have forgotten other books.  You will remember it because it has something important to say, and says it in a way that makes its worthwhile message unforgettable.	2002-10-21

Douglas has stood foursquare in the arena of American politics for many years, often alone, but intransigent.  A strong and icorruptible public servant, he was embattled throughout the many years of his career as United States Senator from Illinois.<br />Paul Douglas has been a great friend of the exploited -- whether underprivileged people or abused natural resources.  His name has come to stand for insistent defense of civil rigghts, hostility to bureaucracy, advocation of the prevention of waste and generous aid to depressed areas, championing of ecological preservation and fierce opposition to all those who hoodwink the public, particularly in terms of lending.<br />Senator Douglas waited to complete this book until his retirement from political life, because he was determined not to write a stuffy, pussyfooting &quot;official&quot; autobiography.  He tells it the way he saw it -- about both the issues and the many prominent people who throng these pages.  Trotsky, Stalin, Truman, Johnson, Nixon, Rayburn, Morse, Stevenson, the Kennedys -- all these and many more are drawn to the life in a fascinating, scrupulously honest book.	2002-10-20

At mid-point in the most tumultuous of recorded centuries, Gerald Johnson has stopped to examine what has happened in the last fifty years to that astonishingly durable person, the American citizen.  In a single unprecedented generation Wilson, Roosevelt and Lenin, three giants of history, have passed and left a changed world after them.  The fourth giant remains to be reckoned with -- Joseph Stalin.  How has the average man reacted to these awsome phenomena?  How has his outlook shifted from the days when nothing was more electrifying than Teddy Roosevelt's teeth, or William J. Bryan's tongue?  What has he done in his own right to shape the men and events of his era?<br />The author of INCREDIBLE TALE brings to these questions the penetrating insight which has long since ranked him among the shrewdest and most readable commentators of our time.  He is not content merely to rake over familiar landmarks; his interest is always in the why and not the what of history, and many of his answers carry a jolt.  Gerald Johnson does not believe the twentieth-century American to be a hero.  He believes in him as a man of sense, with an enlarging awareness of democracy and his responsibility to make it work.  This sense has been acquired the hard way, in a series of decades complacent, gaudy, rich, poor, and supremely critical.<br />In these pages the average American appears in his triumphs -- and in his moments of absurdity, hypocrisy and ignorance; in his struggles with normalcy, depression, phohibition, the New Deal and the Fair Deal.  It has never for a minute been dull, and Gerald Johnson, re-creating an era, has set down all the abundant and fascinating proof that Americans have escaped \\"the most deplorable of all fates -- to die without ever having lived.\\"	2002-10-20

Baruch's memoirs -- America's Elder Statesmean recalls the exciting role he played for nearly fifty years in national and international affairs.  A magnificent successor to MY OWN STORY, Baruch's first volume of memoirs, THE PUBLIC YEARS is infused with the wisdom and warmth of one of the great personalities of our time.<br />Mr. Baruch begins this book with his departure from Wall Street, after an astounding career in finance, to enter public life.  He tells of the problems that confronted him as Chairman of the War Industries Board during World Ware One, and of his role as an advisor to Woodrow Wilson in the shaping of the Treaty of Versailles.  He describes the political wars of the 1920's, and discusses with candor the prominent personalities of that time.<br />Of particular interest are Mr. Baruch's observations on the stock market crash of 1929, the great depression, and the New Deal.  With a perspective born of deep experience in social and economic affairs he analyzes the changes in American life that have accompanied the decline of laissez faire.  Here, as elsewhere in this book, he is concerned with mistakes as well as achievements, and with parallels between the present and the past.<br />In the tumultuous years since Bernard Baruch first entered public life, he has been intimately involved with most of the crucial issues of our time.  In the 1930's, as Germany's power grew, he was among the first to attempt to awaken America to the threat of war.  During the Second World War he was instrumental in guiding our program for defense.  After the war, as American representative on the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, he presented this nation's plan for atomic control.<br />In discussing the momentous developments of the last century, Mr. Baruch draws revealing portraits of many of the famous men he has known, men whose influence helped shape our world.  Woodrow Wilson, Clemenceau, Lloyd George; Coolidge and Hoover; Winston Churchill and F. D. R.; Truman and Eisenhower -- these are but a few of the major figures who appear in THE PUBLIC YEARS, a truly absorbing memoir that is rich in detail, candid, and profound.	2002-10-20

An hour and a half later, she killed her father the same way. Although the story has been told by those least qualified to do so -- outsiders and men. Now, for the first time, this famous American crime is examined by someone with all the proper credentials: Victoria Lincoln is a native of Fall River and thus knows the never-revealed \\"inside\\" story of the crime that insular community regarded as its \\"private disgrace\\"; she is a woman, and as she convincingly demonstrates, the Borden murders -- and their solution -- can be fully understood only by a fellow woman.<br />Miss Lincoln comes up with startling new findings in her penetrating analysis of the crime. Among them: the hitherto unknown motive for the killings (a secret no one but an inhabitant of Fall River, Massachusetts, ever could possibly disclose); a startling new hypothesis to account for Lizzie's celebrated \\"peculiar spells\\" that casts new light on how the crime was committed; and the place where Lizzie hid the dress she was wearing at the time of the murders -- a mystery that has been plaguing criminologists for years.<br />A PRIVATE DISGRACE is far more than a superb book of fact crime; it is a distinguished piece of writing. Victoria Lincoln is a seasoned, best-selling novelist who has a special relationship with her subject: as a child, she not only lived up the street from Lizzie Borden, but knew her personally. Step by step, Miss Lincoln unfolds the background of the crime; she evokes the special mores of the Fall River upper crust who lived \\"up on the hill\\"; she painstakingly re-creates the inquest where Lizzie nakedly admitted her guilt and then was saved by a fantastic stroke of luck -- because of a technicality, the damning inquest trial. But Miss Lincoln does not end with Lizzie's celebrated aquittal; she takes the story beyond to her latter days when, as Lizbeth of Maplecroft, Lizzie lived perhaps her strangest life of all.<br />The Borden case is one of the most enduring -- and perplexing -- landmarks in American crime annals. A PRIVATE DISGRACE is bound to be regarded as the classic book on this classic American crime.	2002-09-25

To his family in the small town of Bingley near Bradford in the north of England, he was known as \\"our Pete.\\"  To the police, who had hunted him for more than six years through the tiwns and cities of Yorkshire, he was known as the Yorkshire Ripper, the sadistic killer of thirteen women.  In this study of Peter Sutcliffe, the man they finally charged, Gordon Burn has given us one of the most incisive and revelatory books ever written about the life and times, the family and social milieu of a mass murderer.<br />Peter Sutcliffe was tried and convicted in a sensational trial at the Old Bailey in 1981, but journalist Burn was struck by the fact that almost nothing had been brought out about the killer's background.  Curious, he went north and found himself staying in Bingley lodgings for two years, getting to know Peter Sutcliffe's father, brother, sisters and close friends.  We see Sutcliffe as a child literally clinging to his mother's skirts and refusing his boisterous father's attempts to make him play football, as an adolescent loner, a gravedigger, and a truck driver, courting his wife for seven years, bragging about women despite a prostitute's rebuff, and spending hours at a horrifying wax museum display.  In all of this and so much more, Gordon Burn allows us to piece together the character and motivation of one of the most savage and mystifying murderers ever known.<br />In telling Peter Sutcliffe's story, Burn also reveals a whole way of life -- as fascinating to outsiders as any ever reported by Margaret Meadm as rich in sharply drawn individuals as a novel by Dickens.  It is a society of northern men in which aggression toward women is commonplace -- a world of drinking clubs, fast driving, millhands, petty criminals, pimps, and prostitutes, through which Sutcliffewas able to move undetected while the police -- failing to coordinate their mass of information -- struggled in vain to track him down.<br />Rarely has a writer drawn so close to the inner truthabout a killer and his crimes or, without sensationalism, told his story with such chilling and compulsive power.	2002-09-17

They were civic-minded churchgoers, and seemed to most of their neighbors to be a warm and loving family. Pictures of Harry, Jr., and his younger brothers Ronnie and Eric playing ball, in Scout uniforms, beside the Christmas tree, could have been taken from their own family albums.<br />Yet, on a Thanksgiving weekend the entire family was murdered except for Harry, Jr., who was eventually convicted for four first-degree murders and sentenced to life in prison. What went wrong with this family? In this unprecendented first-person account by a young man of the murder of his family, readers will track the deadly symptoms of a family life gone wildly awry.<br />Was it Harry, Sr.'s own insecurity and insistence on strong discipline? Or his penchant for guns and teaching his boys riflery? Or his wife Mary Jane's diffidence to his authority? Or was it Harry, Jr.'s ungainliness and the cruel teasing of his classmates? Or the vicious hazing at The Citadel that drove him to the brink?<br />Harry De La Roche tells his story of a troubled teenager with heartbreaking conflicts. The power and drama of his story lie in the common experiences that his family shared with thousands of others blessedly touched by violence. This is a horrifying story of brutal murder, but it is also an extraordinary inside picture of murder's aftermath -- bungles and delay, the loss of key evidence, controversial defense tactics, and crucial psychiatric testimony.<br />Based on hundreds of hours of in-depth jail interviews substantiated by heavy research and documentation, this is the only book that offers a first-hand account of the De La Roche tragedy. A powerful portrayal of an unforgettable character whom everyone knows from somewhere -- and whom some will find uncomfortably close to home.	2002-09-11

The significance of this dramatic discovery and its meaning to the history of Christianity and Judaism, and its relevance to modern Biblical research, is recounted in this absorbing narrative.<BR>The author visited the Dead Sea site and writes of scrolls and scholars with warmth and feeling, telling about the discovery of the scrolls, the environment, historical background, and the personalities involved.  He traces the precarious journey of the scrolls from the hands of the Bedouin boys to the Syrian Metropolitan Samuel at the Monastery of St. Mark in Old Jerusalem.  The Metropolitan purchased half the Hebrew manuscripts and brought them to the attention of interested scholars.  The rest of the manuscripts were purchased by Professor Suknik of the Hebrew University in New Jerusalem.  it was a spectacular find -- the oldest Biblical manuscripts yet known -- which included a complete copy of the book of Isaiah.<BR>One of these scrolls contained a Manual of Discipline evidently used by the Essenes, a pre-Christian monastic order, whose monastery has recently been excavated near the cave where the scrolls were found.  Other caves were explored, and there has come to light what is apparently a whole library of the literature of the religious movement to which the Essenes belonged -- a literature which in some respects corresponds so closely with the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles that the latter are now thought to derive from it.<BR>A shorter version of the book appeared in The New Yorker, where it provoked exceptional response from readers of all religious denominations.<BR>One of the most distinguished literary critics writing today, Edmund Wilson is also a novelist, poet, and playwright.

The book will be found inclusive, authoritative and definitive.  Certain necessary limitations have been set, for example, on the Atlantic seaboard no inn less than one hundred years old has been included, while in the West, where settlement has been more recent seventy-five years has, with few exceptions, been the figure taken.<br />With all this the book is by no means a mere catalogue.  The author has realized to the full the picturesque drama of old posting days, and has recreated this romantic and colorful past as a background across which her narrative moves with a vitality that never slackens.  Strange mysteries haunt more than one old inn; tales of murder and elopement; stories of secret meetings, of plotters and revolutionists; and while dramatic intrigue holds attention there never lacks an enlivening touch of humor in the many quaint anecdotes of strange bills-of-fare and still stranger inn-keepers.	2002-07-14

In writing a history of the novel in England, we have undertaken to bring out the relation of the novel to the interests and attitudes of successive ages, of which it has been the product.  To this end we have not hesitated to introduce many minor figures from the vast plain of fiction above which the major figures rise to distinction.  If the selection of such minor writers seems arbitrary, our explanation is that we have tended to choose those who represent certain interests characteristic of the English reading public of the time.  In the biographical accounts we have tried to emphasize the elements in their experience which gave them their material and determined their moral and aesthetic attitude toward it.  Throughout the book, and especially in the later chapters, we have tried, so far as possible, to draw upon the criticisms and explanations of novelists themselves; and thus to make clear the growth in technique by which the novel has advanced to its present position as a form of literary art.  We owe special acknowledgement to Miss Elizabeth Greenebaum, who has contributed the accounts of Peacock and Gissing, as well as the more important parts of the final chapter.  -- R.M.L. and H.S.H.

Anthea loves children, so naturally she takes a teaching job in Haven, Kansas (not to be confused with the real town of Haven).<br />While she is in the schoolhouse writing a letter to her sisters about how wonderful Kansas is (in reality to her it isn't, but why tell her sisters how horrible it is), Gabriel Jackson storms in the schoolhouse demanding she do the job the town has paid her for... TEACH the kids reading, writing and arithmetic, something that will be useful to his &quot;daughter&quot; when she grows up, NOT balancing a book on her head and walking across the room.<br />Anthea takes offense to this because she went to the best Young Ladies schools and learned it and everything else (reading, writing and arithmetic) and lets him know it to.<br />Because the other kids pick on Gabriel's &quot;daughter&quot;, Anthea takes the child under her wing, bring her that much closer to Gabriel.  And then there's the stories flying around town about how Gabriel acquired Lily (the daughter), and the town council who want Gabriel out of town, but end up liking him.  Including the mayor pro-tem, who's wife Gabriel had an affair with before the woman married the city councilman.  Ever since, that woman has had an infatuation with Gabriel, but Gabriel, once he got Anthea to be his bride cause he wanted to, gives the councilman's wife a piece of his mind about her infatuation with him.<br />THIS is just toooo good to put down and leave alone.

Then an old friend asked him to journey South on a secret mission before war broke out and Trent had to leave his woman's side.  Though she was a fearless warrior and expert marksman, this was a matter of a man's loyalty to his partner -- not of a husband's duty to his wife.

I inherited among others from a deceased family member (among other books).<br />The \\"Hillside Strangler\\" became an everyday headline that frightened Los Angeles for a year or so in the late 1970's.  During that year, bodies of young women started showing up on the hillsides around the city.  But the horror waned beside the revelations that came to light in what became the longest criminal trial in American history--BEFORE O. J. Simpson's 1994 trial--and one of the most controversial<br />The Hillside Strangler was thought to be one person with a real fast pace in killing.  With TWO OF A KIND, Darcy O'Brien gives the inside story and is the first book to make the shocking disclosure that \\"the Hillside Strangler\\" was not one man, but two, and not only that -- they were were cousins!<br />In Mr. O'Brien's riveting story examines the relationship between the murderers and the drive behind their hideously evil crimes.  It tells the entire story of the Hillside Stranglers as it has never been told before.  He begins with the stranglers themselves who just decided one night out of bordom that they hated women and wanted to kill them (even as one strangler was living with a pregnant girlfriend and hiding the truth of his killing spree from her).<br />It reveals the torture, the prostitution ring, the killings.  But it also shows the other side of the drama--the law.  The police were so baffled by the disappearing women and then the subsequent finding them on a hillside dead, that they took drastic measures to ensure justice would prevail in this case.<br />TWO OF A KIND is a true story of crime and punishment here and now.  But even more disturbing, it is a tale of primal evil rising from the darkest human depths and our age-old struggle to defend ourselves from it.	2002-05-29

Subsisting on nothing but orange juice and black coffee, Mr. Buchwald writes his column in longhand on the backs of old White House press releases.  They are then attached to the legs of speedy pigeons and delivered to the 421 newspapers that carry his column to every part of the uncivilized world.<br />From his view on the top of the monument, Buchwald is able to see everything that is going on in the nation's capital.  His sharp eyes pierce the curtains of the Executive Mansion, the Pentagon, the FBI, and, of course the CIA.  Shy, introspective and terribly aloof, Mr. Buchwald rarely leaves his room except to buy Time magazine to see if they've put him on the cover.<br />Despite his long years in Washington, Mr. Buchwald is still a mystery to fellow newspaperment.<br />Some say that Art Buchwald is a pseudonym and the column is written by the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- each service taking the duty for one month.<br />Another theory is that Art Buchwald is really Howard Hughes, which, if true, would make him the richest columnist in the world today.<br />A third theory is that Buchwald is really Dlawhcub Tra spelled backward.<br />In any case Mr. Buchwald is read by millions and millions of people who put their trust in him and count on him to tell them the truth about what is going on in this wicked world today.  More and more, readers now say, \\"I won't believe it until I see it in Art Buchwald's column.\\"  And this is even more surprising, since Mr. Buchwald deals only in fantasy.<br />This book has to do with many of the problems America is faced with today.  It deals with such varied questions as \\"How do you make money in the stock market after World War III?\\" and \\"Does the right of dissent give you the privilege of yelling, \\"Shirley Temple,\\" in a crowded movie theater?\\"<br />It's just what everybody needs to fill his credibility gap.<br />And it's Art Buchwald's best book to date.<br />Have we ever lied to you?	2002-05-27

Or it might be called a biography of the spirit of America.<br />In AMERICA, a poet's intuition has sensed the mystical ebb and flow of human thought and yearnings which were the moving factors behind the Jamestown experiment, behind Valley Forge, behind John Brown at Harper's Ferry, behind the great westward migration.<br />Superficial statistics form the major part of most histories:  How many miles did Stonewall Jackson's foot cavalry march around the swamp at Chancellorsville?  What was James G. Blaine's popular vote?  What was the value in pounds sterling of the cargo dumped overboard at the Boston Tea Party?  Not this one -- for what, after all, is the metric weight of a crushed dream?  And what is the price of freedom per cubic foot?<br />You will find here the underlying spiritual and economic and political forces upon which are builded the statistics of formal history.  You will find these precious elements which have nurtured democracy and made America great.<br />AMERICA, then, is the essence of United States history, caught and dustilled by a poet's insight and written by one of the greatest masters of modern literature.<br />AMERICA is an inspiration and a reassurance in these times that try men's souls.<br />It is a reassurance that democracy is a hardy tree which has survived drought and frost and hurrican in the past and that if we, its keepers, nurture it as our forefathers nurtured it with their blood, it will continue to grow and shelter us and our posterity.	2002-05-27

The British Expeditionary Force had just been evacuated from Dunkirk, and Hitler was in control of the Continent.  The secter of invasion loomed over the British Isles as never before since Napoleon.  Over the roar of cannon boomed the voice of one man -- Winston Churchill -- who personified the determination of the free world to fight the Nazis to final victory.  \\"We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing-grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender....\\"<br />It was Britain's \\"finest hour.\\"  It was also Churchill's finest hour.  The challenge of winning World War II was the climax of a long and eventful life -- the  fullfillment of a destiny that seemed to hover over him since his birth in Blenheim Palace sixty years earlier.<br />Elizabeth Longford -- author of highly acclaimed biographies of Queen Victoria and Wellington -- through her fascinating text and comprehensive photo selection takes a fresh and intimate look at this remarkable man.  The author reveals the complex man that was Churchill...a man of contrasts, who nevertheless had only one goal in life:  to serve his country.  \\"I have faith in my star,\\" he wrote when he was 22, \\"that is, that I am intended to do something in this world.\\" yet when the \\"black dog\\" of depression visited him he wondered the worth of all his struggle.  He was a lifelong, incurable romantic, yet he was the most forceful, direct, and practical of men.  He remained rooted to his English heritage, never relinquishing his vision of Britain as the \\"Empire,\\" yet he treasured his American background, relishing in the fact that his Jerome ancestors had fought with Washington in the Revolution.  A conservative by birth and inclination, he was the only Western leader during World War II with the vision and foresight to recognize the potential postwar menace of Stalin.<br />Churchill was a giant among men, one of thefew who personality affected the course of history.  Through her extensive biographical experience and her own personal knowledge of the man, Lady Longford has limned a new and comprehensive picture of this great man.<br />This book is authorized by the Winston Churchill Foundation.  The photographs have been selected with the help of the Foundation, a number coming from the personal collections of the Churchill family and friends.	2002-05-26

She was definitely the QUEEN OF HELMSLEY PALACE HOTEL.  Her insensitivity extended from her family (her mother, sisters. ex-husbands, and son) to her hired help.  She hovered over Harry Helmsley and made herself indespensible to him.  Mr. Helmsley's brokers, friends and wife (his wife had degrees abound) wondered how Harry could turn his empire over to his second wife who dropped out of high school and faked her degrees.

As a 8 year old child she had us watch the movie with Gregory Peck, it is in b/w.<br />When I was in the 9th grade (a freshman), this book was a requirement, but I knew it already from years before.  And I got an A where this book was concerned.  It's a true classic with life lessons to learn and remember.<br />Well my aunt died in January 2002 and I found the book and kept it as a momento (among other things) and I still remember watching the movie after all these years.  My aunt influenced all of us kids more than she knew.<br />Set in the small Southern town in Alabama, during the Depression, this book follows three years in the life of Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman.  Though her story explores big themes, Ms. Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up.<br />Ms. Lee takes awhile getting to the point of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes from Dracula and coming up with ideas in how to get a glimpse of the boogyman down the street, Boo Radley. At first the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely penetrate the children's consciousness. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well in other things.  By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, To Kill a Mockingbird is one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often by child and adults alike.	2002-05-26

The Society has been part of her &quot;beat&quot; since 1921.<br />Miss Strayer was present at the famous 1929 session when Mrs. Helen Tufts Bailie was denied a hearing of her appeal from expulsion; she overheard Mrs. Bailie's heated comments and those of Mrs. Alfred Brosseau, then President-General.  When Marian Anderson was barred from the DAR's Constitutional Hall, Miss Strayer stood on the greensward near the Lincoln Memorial and heard her give her concert almost at the feet of the Great Emancipator.<br />Miss Strayer came to know many leading ladies of the DAR -- for instance, Mrs. George Thatcher Guernsey, the &quot;plain woman from Kansas&quot;, and Mrs. George Minor, the spiritual New Englander.<br />&quot;I have seen the Daughters do many wonderful things,&quot; Miss Strayer explains, &quot;in connection with historical projects, their schools for mountain children, and Americanization of the foreign born.  Over the years, I have seen the Daughters pursue their objectives with single-minded firmness.  I have watched them make mistakes and sometimes over-rate the importance of their organization.  But I have never under-rated their loyalty and devotion and sincerity and my admiration for many of them as individuals has never faltered.&quot;<br />Former president of the Women's National Press Club andone of Washington's most outstanding newspaper women, Miss Strayer is better acquainted with the DAR than any other American journalist.  She has been a member of the staff of the Washington Daily News since 1921.  She is one of the few newspaper women to win the &quot;Big Story&quot; radio award.

This book is what got me into studying Serial Killers (and how they became what they were).  I've studied the Manson case extensively and come away with different opinion of them each time (all of them not good).<br />Essentially, all the Manson Family was, was a bunch of kids aged 15-28, all runaways that joined up with and let themselves be brainwashed by 5'2\\" Charles Manson.  I think Susan Atkins once said he had the voice of an angel.<br />Between 1967-1969 Charles was preaching to his followers how he wanted to start a race war ... his version of \\"Helter Skelter\\" and that the Beatles were urging him to do it through the White Album.  (How demented is this man?)<br />In 1969, Manson got tired of waiting and told his followers that the population needed a little help in starting Helter Skelter.  So he sent out Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle and Linda Kasabian (the only one with a valid driver's license and snitch) to a house he knew about in the Hills (10050 Cielo Drive).<br />There in the early morning hours, Sharon Tate's \\"Love House\\" (rented from Doris Day's son Terry Melcher and owned by director Rudi Altobelli) went from \\"Love House\\" to Slaughterhouse as Sharon and each of her 3 friends and a bystander (Folger, her boyfriend Frykowski, Sebring and Parent) were brutally and horrifically killed.  Sharon was 8-1/2 months pregnant with her first child from her husband, director Roman Polanski.<br />The next night, Charles said it was too messy and he went along and brought along Leslie Van Houten.  There a couple who owned a grocery store chain were killed in the same horrific way.

He and his assistant investigated, and tried the four murderersin a California Federal Court and got the death penalty for each one for the Tate-LaBianca killings.<br />Today, the main people in the Manson Family (including the 1st in command Squeaky Fromme for trying to kill President Ford).  In 1972 the death penalty in California was abolished and the Manson Family's sentences got commuted to Life.  The Death Penalty was reinstated in 1973 or '74.  Every now and then you'll hear about a Manson Family member come up for Parole and being denied.  Most recently as (5/23/2002) Leslie Van Houten (participated in LaBianca murder) has come up for Parole and been denied, and now she thinks she has been unjustly denied Parole after all these years.

US	51080263	R2EMMUNTRCF9R5	0749005165	793388001	The True History of the Elephant Man	Books	5	21	23	N	N	Soul stirring and heart warming account of a young man	I inherited this book from a deceased family member. I had heard about David Lynch's movie about The Elephant Man, but I never saw it. Reading this book made me cry and empathize with Joseph Carey Merrick for his condition and the ostractize he received from the world based on his looks and not his soul.<br />Joseph Carey Merrick was the real Elephant Man not a fictional character. Joseph had a loving mother that died when he was a child and his father moved and remarried. His step-mother didn't like him and scorned him for his looks and his inability to find work due to his lameness, telling him that what she fed him was more than he earned. Eventually he refused to return home for meals because he didn't want to listen to step-mother barate him anymore. His father stopped looking for him, but did get him a hawker's license to hawk wares on the street. But people were afraid of him and would not buy his wares, and he acquired a gathering of curious people around him. His uncle gave him shelter for a while, but Joseph left there too. He worked in the workhouse a place of refuge and work for the poor and destitute for 3 years, but hated it and left. He ended up being exhibited as a sideshow freak under the name of \\"The Elephant Man\\" because his congenital deformity made it so that he resemble that of an elephant (or so the posters showed him to resemble). When he was at Whitechapel Road, across the street from the London Hospital Dr. Treves saw him for the first time and brought him to the hospital to examine him. Over the next few years Joseph was exhibited, his managers robbed him of his life savings and left. Joseph went back to Whitechapel Road and to the care of the only friend he knew . . . Dr. Treves. He spent his remaining years under the friendship and care of the staff at the London Hospital.<br />I loved this story. Michael Howell and Peter Ford told a true and compassionate account of Joseph Merrick's life. A man who was like any other human being with hopes and dreams with one setback.. His congenital deformity that prohibited his ability to be like, and experience and sleep lying down on his back like other people. Through all of years and hardships, Joseph was scared, but kind and kept a calm serenity inside himself about his condition. He had so much gratitude for the staff and his new friends who helped him, he made cardboard models and sent these things to those people who saw to his care in his appreciation for their help. The book also includes pictures how Merrick looked when he was admitted to the London Hospital, and a display of his skeleton after death.	2002-05-23

I love F. Rosanne Bittner's stories.  She writes with such clarity that you think you are there with the characters watching them as a third party.  In 'Comanche Sunset' Wade Marrow is the son of a Freight Shipping Mogul, but he is also part Comanche who was abandoned by his real mother because he was a twin and Comanches think of Twins as Bad Omens.  Well Lester and Vivian Marrow saved Wade from the ravages of the Texas Plains and went to California.  In 1860, Wade is now 26 years old and in search of his Indian Heritage, so he hops one of his father's freight trains and goes to San Antonio where he signs on as Indian Scout for a stage coach going to Fort Stockton and meets Jennifer Andrews who is going to Ft. Stockton as a mail-order bride.  Along the way the stage coach gets attacked by renegade Indians and all but Wade and Jennifer are dead in the raid.  Wade and Jennifer travel alone through the Texas plains towards Ft. Stockton with Wade treating her wounds and they soon realize there was no denying the passion they were destined to share in the magnificent glow of the Comanche Sunset.<br />The characters are simple and believable.  This book as been a favorite of mine for years because Ms. Bittner uses real places and real history in her stories that set the scene for the couples in her romance novels.  Ms. Bittner did a great job in creating these characters, for how the story was written they are suited for each other.  I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys Indian romance and a F. Rosanne Bittner fan.	2002-05-22

This classic gives insight into the mind of the Serial Sex Killer, Ted Bundy. Described variously as \\"handsome, smooth talking, erratic and charming\\" except one thing he killed women descriminately. This gives a detailed account (as Stephen G. Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth researched it and did interviews with family, friends, girlfriends, the sympathic wife who believed Bundy was innocent to the end and wouldn't hear otherwise.... and Bundy himself straight from Death Row in 1980.<br />Bundy, himself, wouldn't discuss the murders as if he did it, he never said he was guilty of the crimes, he always claimed he was innocent (even as he went to the the executioner in 1989). So Michaud and Aynesworth made a deal with him that he didn't have to discuss them as if he did it, he could discuss them as if discuss a psychological case, and Bundy agreed to that. So Bundy discusses his crimes and his \\"entity\\" (as he called it) in third person throughout the book.<br />Bundy was a textbook sexual psychopath who terrorized the College communities of Washington, Utah and Florida over a span of years. He left none if little evidence so he was very hard to catch. As all serial killers do, they get cocky and so self-assured they won't get caught that they make a mistake and Ted Bundy made his mistake in Florida around the University in Tallahassee where he was caught.<br />The Only Living Witness answers all the questions about one of America's worst monsters. It is a timeless classic. It covers most of Bundy's life, including his youth and his years as a student and volunteer before murder became his primary occupation and after ... when the first 4 or 5 girls went missing and he volunteered to \\"help\\" the DES with the searches for the women as a credit for his law school course, or so he would have his girlfriend (at the time) believe.<br />I finished the book with a sense of fright for those women never found, and sadness for the families that won't get to bury the missing women, and the family and friends of Ted Bundy who was so manipulated and conned by their son and friend so much they believed in his innocence until he at last confessed the murders. A brilliant brilliant read and research source into the mind of a mass serial killer and sexual defiant psychopath. His crimes are as vivid and studied today as they were when he was being hunted and caught!	2002-05-21

I bought this a long time ago and finally have settle down to actually read it.  I enjoyed the novel.  It had twists and turns that you don't expect until you read them.  Kinsale creates original, believable and intriguing characters for her stories.  No book and story are alike with her.  She get a fresh new scenerio every time.<br />In this story, the myth of the notorious highwayman \\"The Prince of Midnight\\" is a huge legend in London... the vindicator, the protector, the theif, the charmer.  When her town is highjacked by a priest who brainwashes the town and destroys her family, Leigh goes in search of the fabled hero to teach her how to fight so she can kill her family's murderer.  She travels all the way to France only to find a stumbling, drunk shadow of the fabled hero living in solitude in the Alps.  The travel across land and sea back to England... and find themselves in precarious positions along the way.  The only thing that racked my brain was that Leigh was so frustrating even I wanted to yell at her as much as the hero did.  But Laura Kinsale is so wonderful in her storytelling I gave it 4 stars!	2002-05-19

I like Laura Kinsale cause no 2 books by her are the same.  Where Uncertain Magic was set in Ireland and based on ESP and the magic of love, The Shadow and the Star is completely different.  It's based mostly in England and Hawaiian Islands.  Ms. Kinsale is a wonder when it comes to writing characters that are interesting and believable.  The era seems to have been well researched before she wrote the characters, they fit the era.  No over-embellishment or modernized for the 21st century.  It seems that whenever I pick up a Laura Kinsale novel she holds my interest so well that I read every word from chapter 1 to the end.  She has a plot that holds and meaningful characters.  My favorite scene is where Sam sneaks into her room at night and she attacks him with a poker and he falls and breaks his leg, but he doesn't scare her, just watches over her as she sleeps, and in the morning he still manages to climb up in the ceiling beams with a broken leg.  I would recommend this book to any romance reader who is looking for a romance novel with a strong plot and strong characters.	2002-05-16

I was iffy about reading it, but once I was [brought] into the story I was hooked until the end.  It starts out at the end where Carly Tyler is standing trial for murder.  It is sensationalism to the max where the media is concerned.  But as she waits for a verdict, her mind goes back to the events leading up to her situation.  Her lover and his sister left her for dead at the side of the road fifteen years ago, and when she comes out of a coma, she has no recollection of how she got there.  She goes in search of her past only to end up in a Vineyard in Napa Valley and face-to-face with James McGuane.  He is wealthy, has sexual charisma and the key to her past.

I have no wish to read the tale of Patricia Kennealy... who has always talked about herself and her feelings in her writings, not caring about what Jim would have really thought.

The first anthology of the best writing of Robert Morley is both a literary and a social event.  Morley has always considered himself to be as much writer as actor, and, in addition to his plays, he has long been a contributor to American and British magazines.  In 1972 he was voted wittiest writer of the year by Playboy.<BR>Ranging from delightful reminiscences of his childhood in England to hilarious accounts of his various travels, he reveals himself as a self-mocking, candid man in his attitudes toward the secrets of his profession, his financial status, and many aspects of contemporary life and/or death.  (\\"When I have to die,\\" he writes, \\"I should like to do so in the foyer of the best hotel in the world.\\")  Best of all, the reader sees Robert Morley through Robert Morley's eyes (\\"I am not a reasonable man\\"):  as gambler, diner, actor, traveler, family man, invalid, schoolboy, taxpayer, and clubman.<BR>As Alan Coren says in his preface to The Robert Morley Bedside Reader, \\". . . a great nostalgic, Robert Morley will annihilate bogus sentimentality with on adroit word; he will defend romance with reason, and make truth ring out on laughter; he will indulge himself utterly and yet share that indulgence so delightfully that it becomes selfless; he will make arrogance a scaffolding from which to construct some baroque comic point, then kick that scaffolding down to reveal it for the temporary conveience it was, because he is a master of caricature and the self-portrait is his chef d'oeuvre.\\"	2002-04-15

She ponders this relationship from the daughter's birth, revealing the mother's innermost thoughts about her little girl -- her fond if often foolish hopes for the child's future.  But as her little bundle of femininity develops into a personality unto herself, Mother may find that her aspirations have been somewhat thwarted along the way and that she and her daughter are more often at odds than they are in harmony.  The rift may be influenced by social norms, religious practices, economics, or academic standards.  The degree to which these conditions exist is of little importance -- rebellion hurls itself at too much just as readily as it does at too little.  Other contributing factors are the mother's treatment of other children in the family, the mother's relationship with her own mother, and the parents' attitude toward each other.<BR>All this Mrs. Neisser has probed, sifted, and analyzed for the edification of every mother and daughter of our time -- whether young or middle-aged, single or married, working or not, living together or apart.  Mrs. Neisser lets mothers know that they themselves practically write the script and coach the players -- their daughters -- for tragedy.  Daughters come in for their share of criticism too, and the author holds both parent and child equally responsible for the outcome.  Her approach is forthright yet sympathetic, and makes the reader feel that her very own personal problem has been under study and that she is about to find a solution -- which indeed she may.<BR>In addition to the mother-daughter relationship throughout life there is a chapter dealing with the effect on a daughter if her mother dies.  And very wisely handled is the entrance of a stepmother.<BR>There are references to case histories and to literary classics on mother-daughter situations that parallel those of today.  One chapter deals with mothers and daughters in other places, giving an interesting cross-cultural view of the relationship in such fring areas as the Pacific atoll and the African bush.<BR>Mrs. Neisser has used, in addition to her own observations during extensive travels in Europe, the Middle East, Mexico, West Indies, and Japan, the findings and views shared with her by eminent educators in such fields as sociology, psychology, and anthropology.  She now offers them to the reader along with valuable advice for achieving a harmonious and immensely satisfying relationship.<BR>Mothers and Daughters will also serve as supplementary reading in courses in family relations, personality development, child development, and psychology at the college level; and will be useful to students in schools of social work.	2002-04-13

And suddenly the forty-six documents presented herer become as significant and inspiring to us as they were to the patriots who wrote them.<br />From the simple, two-paragraph Mayflower Compact drawn up by the Pilgrims in 1620 to the stirring Inaugural Address delivered by President Eisenhower in 1953, By These Words presents and interprets the vital writings and speeches which have marked more than three centuries of American thought and progress.<br />Here are the words that voiced the colonists' resentment of tyranny, culminating in the immortal Declaration of Independence.  Here are the arguments that secured freedom of the press, freedom of religion, the right of labor to organize.  Here are the conflicting beliefs that brought on the Civil War.

He points out that the hardest lesson he had to learn in journalism was \\"the meaning of power on the job,\\" and is outspoken about the \\"TV Gatekeepers,\\" the men who run the over 700 stations in the United States and control what viewers see.<br />Donahue is as candid about his personal life as he is about his career.

I inherited this book from a deceased family member (along with other true crime books).  Peter Meyer tells a compelling and thoroughly-investigated story about a true rape-murder in a sleepy town in Vermont (much like my own hometown).  An unthinkable crime in an unsuspecting town.  It's tragic, and for the two little girls that it happened to, I came away from this book thanking God that the surviving girl got her story out and the animals that did it were caught!  Only the highest praise for Peter Meyer to have the courage to write this story and get it published for others to see that it can happen ANYWHERE!	2002-03-15

I've read this book many times.  &quot;A Promise of Thunder&quot; is another great book from Connie Mason.  It takes place in September, 1893 during the Cherokee land rush in Guthrie, Oklahoma.  Grady &quot;Thunder&quot; Stryker and Storm Kennedy clash after a stray bullet in a gunfight hits Storm's husband.  Storm loses her claim to Grady, and he gives her an offer she can't refuse.  To keep her land, she has to marry him and take care of his motherless son from his first marriage.  She grudgingly agreed only to fall in love with him.  But there's an obstacle...  the sister of his dead first wife has come to deliver his son to him and plans to stay and get between Storm and Grady.  The love Grady and Storm have won't allow it, and the need to separate the intruding woman from their relationship (and the budding relationship between Storm and Grady's son) leads all the way to Wyoming and Grady's parents' farm.  This wonderful book is the sequel to &quot;Beyond The Horizon&quot;, the story of Grady's parents, Swift Blade and Shannon Branigan.	2002-02-17
