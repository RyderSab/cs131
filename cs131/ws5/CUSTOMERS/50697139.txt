Then she sees the one person she admires commit murder, and she returns to the one place she is safe, a small ranching community in the mountains of Idaho. There her high school love is, and she finds herself entangled in his life again. She's trying to escape being a murder victim. He's a soldier on an undercover mission. The sexual attraction between them burns, but they've both grown up and now have ulterior motives and deep secrets.<br /><br />Almost Like Being In Love is compelling and HOT (wait until you read the scene in the barn) but the story is complex and exciting. I hate ranch books, hate cowboy hats, hate horses, but Christina Dodd sucked me in when she wrote Just The Way You Are and I had to read this book. Fabulous! I can't wait for the third installment.	2004-05-29

JUST THE WAY YOU ARE is a classic romance, with a virginal heroine and a dynamic hero who is absolutely ignorant of love and who finds out the hard way that a good woman is hard to find. I wish Dodd hadn't left the story hanging with such a lead into the next story, but it in no way detracted from the sexuality and the sweet, hot discovery of love between Hope and Zach. Dodd should have been writing contemporary sooner; she needs to forget historicals and write what she knows.	2003-06-27

I didn't know if Christina Dodd could write anything but governess books, but this book is a whole different slant. Madeline is a duchess. Her cousin Eleanor is her companion. They change places and Madeline pretends to be a companion to retrieve a family heirloom. She's awful at everything she's supposed to do, and the girl she's a companion to doesn't even want her to do her hair. Worse, she meets her ex-fiance, Gabriel Ansell, and he wants her back as his lover and his wife. I seldom laugh and fan myself at the same time, but I did in this book.

Unfortunately, Samantha is blessed with a kind heart that can't bear injustice, and when she manages to get herself in trouble in London, Adorna sends Samantha to the wilds of the Lake District to be a governess to Colonel William Gregory's six daughters.

Soon she's got the kids eating out of her hand, but William isn't so easy to manage. He demands disciple and respect. Instead, he gets an intelligent young woman with a witty tongue who is far too attractive. With spies on the loose and a gorgeous woman in his house, William quickly finds catching the spies are the easy part -- more important, he must earn Samantha's love.<br />Dodd wraps up the connected spy stories from IN MY WILDEST DREAMS and LOST IN YOUR ARMS in this funny, satisfying addition to the Governess Brides series.	2002-09-01

I picked My Scottish Summer up because I'm a push-over for anything Scottish, but I didn't expect it to be so much fun.
