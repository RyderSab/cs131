What a wonderful story of love, betrayal, a child gone wrong, and family relationships.  The characters and the setting seemed so real.

I have to agree with reader/reviewer,\\"Confused\\", that you need a flow chart to keep track of the characters and their doings in this book.  I liked the first 2/3 of the book, but then the plot started branching all over the place. The motives of the characters weren't clear to me, and there were so many poorly developed characters that I couldn't keep their stories straight.  Even though I took extra care to read slowly and comprehend, when I was done with the book, I couldn't tell you who did what--nor did I really care anymore.  I have read thousands of books of this genre through the years, but this one just got ridiculous.  I've read Coben's other books with enjoyment.  I realize that this is not the popular opinion of this book, but it's mine.	2005-08-30

Li Cunxin's account of his early life in China was so vivid that I literally shed tears for him. Later,I found myself cheering his brilliant successes in the ballet world.

I have read both installments of this Dexter series, and they are certainly unusual.  I found myself chuckling often during this story, and then I would feel horrified at myself for laughing at such gory stuff.  That's just the way the whole book went.  It is really so outlandish, that it's hard to take seriously.  But then, why was I so eager to see how the plot played out?  I'm anxious to see what is in store for Dexter next.	2005-08-16

I've loved all of Pat Conroy's other books, so I can't believe I waited until recently to read Lords of Discipline.  I guess the military theme put me off for awhile.  However, after visiting The Citadel in Charleston a couple of years ago, I got curious about Conroy's perception of this school.  Well, I loved this book!  There were so many different plots and sub- plots; and throughout, there was Pat Conroy's wonderfully poetic writing.  I revisited Charleston through his words, and now I want to rush back there to see the things we missed the first time.  I was shocked at the treatment of Plebes at the Carolina Military Institute, and I imagine most of it is fact.  It was really rather disturbing, and so I cheered at the times in the book when the Plebes scored small victories over their tormentors. I felt almost lonely when the book was done, as I missed being in the \\"world\\" and with the characters in this book.  I guess I'll have to read it again.	2005-08-02

I read a lot of mysteries/suspense novels, and believe that Martinez could have left something to our imaginations as other great writers do.  I was also bothered by heroine Melanie Vargas' role as a mother.  She was extremely negligent as a parent, and that detracted from my enjoyment of the book.  Call that picky, but it bothered me.  Otherwise, there was a lot of suspense in this book and I might read a sequel to see what happens to Vargas and her romances.   <br />	2005-06-08

Your father has been taken to jail in a far-away state, and your fiance has been selected to defend him.  All of this happens to Delia Hopkins--or is that really her name?  This is the premise of Picoult's new book.  I found it to be compelling reading.  Each chapter told the story from the point of view of one of the four main protagonists.  I especially enjoyed the grim descriptions of life for Andrew in an Arizona jail, and I also enjoyed the descriptions of life in a Hopi village in Arizona. These chapters were vivid and fascinating.  The only part I did not like was the love triangle that Delia finds herself a part of.  That just did not ring true in my mind. I have read all of this author's books, and I look forward to each one.  This one did not let me down.	2005-03-01

This book was good on so many different levels.  First of all, I loved the flavor of Key West that runs all through it. Many times I felt as though I were there--even though I have never seen the Keys for myself.  Knowing that the author spends several months a year there, tells me that most of these places actually exist. Secondly, the characters were so vivid.  I loved Keely, Punt, Jass, Gram, and Beau, and I'd love to read a sequel to find out more about them.  I found myself deeply involved in their adventures, and I was often rooting and frightened for them.  Last, a great deal of suspense ran throughout the novel.  It might have been the pervasive, malevolent presence of Jude; the fire; the body; or perhaps the suspicions of the police.  All of these things kept me reading frantically.  I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a well-written, compelling novel.	2005-02-27

I have especially enjoyed John Corey, the hero in Night Fall and other books by this author.  I like his \\"smart mouth\\" and his way of not being intimidated by anybody or anything.  I can remember the real TWA Flight 800 crash, so this fiction based on that fact book was really fascinating to me.  It was compelling reading, and I didn't even mind the ending. At least it made sense. It is scary to me that this coverup might have actually happened in the real incident.  From accounts that I now read on the Internet, it sounds plausible.  I would really recommend this as a great book from a favorite author.	2004-12-01

Neely Tucker, a white journalist posted in Zimbabwe, and his wife Vita, a black woman, fall in love with a female infant in an orphanage in that country.  The baby's name is Chipo, which means \\"gift\\" in the local language.  The story, a family memoir, details the couple's attempts to adopt this baby with whom they have fallen in love.  The story also explains the political situation in Zimbabwe, which is unstable and volatile, especially toward foreign journalists.  There is also a great deal of information about the AIDS crisis in Africa, and how this dread disease has impacted so many families and created millions of orphans.  These three topics were interwoven in the book to make a fascinating and extremely interesting story.   I could feel the Tuckers' frustration with the bureaucratic red tape they had to wade through in order to someday adopt Chipo.  I admired their tenacity--all because of their intense love for this beautiful baby. It would be interesting to follow this little girl into adulthood, and I hope Neely Tucker has such a possibility in mind.	2004-03-10

This book concerned the disappearance of 4 young people from a camp site in Yosemite National Park in California. Ranger Anna Pigeon is sent there as an undercover &quot;spy&quot; to see if she can find out what happened to them.  Anna is certainly a gutsy lady, and she gets herself into many tight, dangerous situations.  The pursuit of Anna by two villains through the wilderness was breathtaking.

So, I put that one on reserve at the library and checked out HIGH CRIMES.  What a great book!  I love court room dramas anyway, and this one was gripping.  Claire is defending her husband who has been arrested on charges of committing 87 murders during a wartime slaughter.  Lawyer Claire takes on the job of defending him in a military trial.  The trial itself is fascinating, but that ending is a blockbuster and so unexpected.  Now I find that it has been made into a movie, and I want to see it.  I hope they didn't change a thing.  I really recommend this book for all readers who enjoy a good thriller.	2004-02-12

I loved everything about this book, and it reminds me of one of Grisham's first books, A TIME TO KILL. The characters were so real and well-developed. His books are always so full of rich detail that I just sink into the words and almost become a participant in the plot.  There were really two plots going on in this book.  The first one was the murder and rape of a young mother in the small town of Clanton, Mississippi and the subsequent arrest and trial of Danny Padgitt.  The second plot was the friendship between Willie Traynor, the newspaper owner, <BR>and Callie Ruffin, the last juror.  Grisham does a remarkable job of weaving these two plot lines together and having them mesh at the end.  The result was just so good that I savored every word.  I really hope that all book-lovers will get a chance to read this wonderful story.	2004-02-07

I did think, though, that some of the scenes were way too long.  The climax scene in the tunnels under the Capitol near the end of the book was full of violence. It just went on and on forever and got extremely physical and rough.  The sequence of the events in the old gold mine in South Dakota was very descriptive and exciting, but it also was too long.  <br />I wish he had devoted some of those pages to tying up a few loose ends at the end of the book.  I thought that he hurried through the last few pages, and it left me wondering about quite a few things that were not adequately explained. <br />One other strange thing that I noticed was about the blurb on the book jacket.  Whoever wrote that had obviously not read the book because it is not correct. Once you have read the book, you will see what I mean about the correctness of the jacket. Maybe a picky thing, but I noticed it and it should be changed in later editions. Lots of people read those blurbs before deciding whether or not to read a book.<br />All in all, I would recommend THE ZERO GAME to others.  I have read all of the other Brad Meltzer books and have loved them.It was a great effort from a popular author.	2004-02-01

I also greatly enjoyed it, and I won't give a synopsis of the story, because you can read that elsewhere. The characters are so vivid and alive.  There is Martha, the matriarch of the family, and her several daughters.  Cassie, the youngest has an illegitimate son named Frank, whom she almost gave away when he was a baby.  The story follows Frank's growing-up years near Coventry, England before and during WWII.  Graham Joyce has a knack for vivid descriptions.  The bombing of Coventry during the war is described in such detail, that I could feel the horror and also every tremor.  There is a description of an undertaking parlor as seen through young Frank's eyes that is wonderful.  Also, the ending is so extremely satisfying and unexpected.  We find out who &quot;The Man Behind the Glass&quot; is, and I never guessed it at all.  I would really recommend this book as a compelling read.  This should become a classic.	2004-01-31

The deacons of the church decide to exhume her body and have the family bury her in the black cemetary down the road.  That night the white church burns under mysterious circumstances.  Did Elijah, the black father, burn it--along with the young woman inside?  The rest of the book is a legal battle to determine who<BR>the arsonist/murderer really is. The book was fascinating, and the writing was poetic at times. There were unexpected twists and turns to the ending. It is exactly the kind of book that makes a very satisfying read for me.	2003-12-11

The plot line was fascinating: stolen artifacts, a mysterious woman, a lying deceitful father, a murdered mother, sudden wealth, and three sons seeking the truth.

The reader goes along with Katie when she meets each one of the suspects, and we hear their alibis. I felt very much like a P.I. myself, as I tried to figure out \\"who did it\\" from the information given. Katie was a novice at solving murders, but she didn't back away when things get rough. I especially enjoyed the local color of Key West and the descriptions of the surrounding attractions, restaurants, wild-life, and plant-life. The writing itself was very smooth and tight.

I really enjoyed the main plot about ghostly happenings, and I especially liked the historical information about the eugenics project in Vermont in the 1930's.  Her characters were well-drawn and interesting.  However, I found the book getting tedious and too long after about 300 pages, and there was still over a hundred pages to go.

There is certainly never a \\"down time\\" in her books.  Anna Pigeon, the National Park Service Ranger, goes from one perilous adventure to another.

Dry Tortugas National Park is a place that I've never heard of before, but I feel now as though I've actually been there.

I really like his main character, Alan Gregory, and I almost feel as though I know him.  This book kept me guessing to the end.  The plot twists concerning &quot;who did what&quot; were slick.  The ending was a bit much when bullets starting flying everywhere in the dark, but I guess that's what we've come to expect at the climax of a story--especially a mystery/thriller.  I did think that Alan acted very irresponsibly at the ending when he tried to take care of things without the help of the police.  That didn't see realistic to me.  I would love to read more about Kelda James, the female FBI agent who was the main female protagonist in the book.  She was flawed, but gutsy.  Her next adventure would make a good read.  All in all, it was a really good story, and I didn't want to put it down.	2003-02-13

Therefore, I especially enjoyed the description of his treatment as a plebe at that institution.  I just cannot say enough good things about his glorious descriptive passages and the poetry of his words.  This is a must read!!!!!	2002-11-19
US	47637794	R2LV664A8UXVPG	0553801929	562039873	Dark Horse	Books	2	5	10	N	N	Disappointing	I've read several other Tami Hoag books, but I found this one disappointing.  All the references to the \\"horse world\\" were rather confusing to me.  I also thought that there were way too many characters to keep track of.  There were many potential <BR>evil-doers; and since these characters were not fully developed, I found myself bored and distracted.  The plot got very intricate, and by the end I didn't care anymore about who did what.  I'm not even sure why I finished it, except that I hate to stop a book in mid-stream.<br />On a positive note, I did like her main character, Elena Estes. She was a very gutsy ex-policewoman, but she didn't usually display a lot of common sense.  You'd have to give her an \\"A\\" for effort.  There was a hint of romance in the book between this woman and Detective Landry.  I hope they do get together because they seem like kindred, but damaged souls.	2002-10-13

I was not disappointed.  I found that Sheila had carried a great deal of anger around with her all these years toward Torey for \\"showing her the good life and then deserting her just like her mother had.\\"  This rather dumb-founded Torey, because she was just doing what all teachers do at the end of a school year--saying good-bye to her students and moving on.  Torey had to work very hard in this book to build up a trust level again.  Sheila was not going to make this easy.  However, the ending was satisfying; and we are left knowing that Sheila will be all right.  I don't know how Torey makes her writing such compelling reading.  I could not put the book down--even when I needed to look at scenery on a vacation.  I recommend this book to anyone who needs a heart-warming read.	2002-10-10
US	47637794	R14V945CURKRKG	0380813394	505180381	Beautiful Child	Books	5	11	14	N	Y	Never Give Up	I have been an elementary teacher for 35 years, and I always get so inspired by Torey's books.  So often, we teachers give up on children like Venus.  We are just so overwhelmed with the enormity and expected futility of the task, that we just don't try hard enough.  Torey never gives up on Venus.  If one tactic doesn't work, she tries and tries and tries again.  The positive results were heart-warming.  Torey also has a self-deprecating sense of humor.  We never feel that she is Super Woman--she is just a teacher trying hard to make a difference. I have read all of Torey Hayden's books, and I will wait eagerly for the next one.  This one is definitely a winner!!!	2002-10-04
