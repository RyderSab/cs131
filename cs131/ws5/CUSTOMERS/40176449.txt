There is a liberal bias in the media. Is that necessarily wrong, as long as everyone knows it? The answer is , yes and no. Yes, if it is intentional. No, if it is untentional.

But, I don't see how Remick thinks others in the media will know whether a bias is intentional or unintentional. Maybe he can give us more details to help us understand. It is certainly an idea that merits further pursuit.

I went through Ranger school years ago. There have been changes, no doubt. There is, and always will be, that &quot;old school&quot; vs &quot;new school&quot; joshing around. I have no problem with that. Ranger training was gruelling then, and is gruelling now. That's the bottom line. I only have a problem with people --- liberals --- who pooh-pooh the need for our training. Their big comment is, &quot;why should America be involved in anything that would require &quot;grunts&quot; with that kind of training?&quot;. They just don't get it, do they. They're always looking for cerebral principles and explanations, not military ones. I tell them they should try reading the book &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick that gives all the cerebral philosophical principles and explanations, in plain language, for why our founding fathers decided America needed military leaders trained to have courage, character, and leadership ingrained in them, the ultimate training of which is Ranger School, as depicted in &quot;Ranger Handbook&quot;. That's the only thing that answers their question, &quot;why Ranger School?&quot;. Now that we finally recognize we are in a new kind of war, what are we to do --- grow beards, don muslim head dress, and all convert to Islam? The answer is NO! Who are those 20% of the people in the polls who don't support this new kind of war, anyway? I don't know. But, to those people in foreign countries who have been secretly supporting terrorists whose ultimate aim it is to kill American men, women, and children and destroy the USA, I say, we have Rangers defending America and our American principles.

I flew threw it in a few hours. If you enjoy inspirational stories presented in a framework along the lines of &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; or &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, but not shallow like &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, I recommend that you also read &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. I say &quot;also&quot; because Grisham is always worth reading -- even if he tries to forget about this one after he deposits all that money in the bank thanks to those who buy anything at Christmas. Meanwhile, I myself give &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; 5 stars because of how clever Grisham is. His motive for the book is the exact antithesis of the storyline. He cleverly recognized the irony of it all. Do you?	2001-11-18

So do not think you can take away true information, when a writer knows we cannot scrutinize what she says, because it is fiction, and she can say anything she wants to say. Second, I agree with the reviewer who is not happy about grads continuing to &quot;milk&quot; the Academy (and, by extension, the taxpayer). I say, leave it alone, why don't you! Third, though the writer is obviously the beneficiary of West Point's educational excellence, the book is really nothing more than your typical &quot;what I did last summer&quot; essay, in extended form. And, fourth, if you want to know what West Point is really all about, read a bonafide non-fiction book based on hard research facts (I recommend a fascinating book called &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick). &quot;Battle Dress&quot; cannot give you that. It can only give you a nicely written, but fictional story. And it is heavily weighted to the female point of view, with much bias. It perpetuates the &quot;we-they&quot; difference between men and women. &quot;Viva la differ'ence&quot;!	2001-11-18

It's nice that the purely fictional Harry Potter books are fun and enjoyable. But, is Harry's little lying, cheating, stealing, mocking, and sneaking around when it conveniences him, and breaking all the rules when they inconvenience him, sending a wrong message to our kids that &quot;character doesn't count&quot; --- just when we are trying to make a national effort to teach kids &quot;character counts&quot;? It's nice that the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; stories of magic and wizardry, presented within the framework of a fantasy, are making kids read. But, are our kids truly becoming &quot;readers&quot;? Would they graduate now, for instance, to reading something like the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, but having real educational benefit like (I would recommend) Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point&quot; which is a book of TRUE stories that teaches right from wrong and &quot;character counts&quot;, yet still excitingly presented within the framework of a fantasy, like the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books are? Too me, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, or &quot;West Point&quot;, or any other book will not just be great fun, but also valuable to our kids only:<br />  If, it helps them be strong enough to know when they are weak,<br />  and brave enough to face themselves when they're afraid<br />  If, it teaches them to have wishes,<br />  but wishes that will not take the place of deeds<br />  If, it leads them away from the path of ease and comfort,<br />  so they can stand up in the storms of life<br />  If, it teaches them to master themselves,<br />  before they seek to master other things<br />  If, it makes them reach into the future,<br />  yet never, never forget the past<br />  If, though serious, it gives them enough of a sense of humor,<br />  to never take themselves too seriously<br />  If, the books we give can help them thru their growing pain,<br />  then we the parents can quietly whisper, &quot;we have not lived<br />  in vain&quot;<br />The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books are a lot of fun to read. But I don't want to risk it too long. I also want our kids to get serious enough to move up to books that are a little higher level of intelligence that send the right messages. Maybe it's only me.

The problem is, O'Reilly has done the same thing with his book, &quot;The No-Spin Zone&quot;. I'm sorry, but the book fits the M.O. of books that fall into the quick-write spin-zone. It has 200 pages of his own pompous pseudo-philosophy, stated as facts. He needs to get hold of a book that reviews the real philosophy he probably had in college, perhaps like the book of his obvious &quot;fan&quot; above, and put some foundation under his know-it-all presentaments. Then the no-spin spinner might truly become a no-spinner, and perhaps even win people like me over to his side, rather than continue to be a big know-it-all. My guess is, however, he will simply take that as bad advice from the other side. For he automatically has all those sheep out there that, like the lead sheep that falls into a hole, just follow right into the same hole. That's my impression of most of the 80% favorable Amazon.com reviews I have just finished reading that Bill O'Reilly so pompously mentions on his TV show in the process of taking expensive air time to spin his own book. Too bad, because all the reviewers do seem to be intelligent, however mesmerized they may be. Bill O'Reilly is obviously a good guy and a noble-minded American who I could enjoy watching more often, and who got my money for his &quot;book of opinions&quot;. I strongly recommend that he and his &quot;O'Reilly Regiments&quot; take to heart what I have said here from the heart. I hope they all, please, begin to get the picture.	2001-11-15
