My third grade students loved this book!  Only a handful are English language Learners but all the kids got a kick out of the gorgeous illustrations and the fun poetry.  We read the poems together in both English and Spanish and the kids had fun painting their own impressions of the poetry.  I strongly recommend this book for any K - 6 classroom!	2003-08-23

It is a sweet story of perseverance with very appealing illustrations. Besides demonstrating the idea that sticking with something (growing apples, playing baseball or whatever) leads to success, there is a nice seasonal component to the story.  There are some terrific illustrations of insects and even specific directions for hitting the ball with the bat (which my students enjoyed trying out).  There is also a simple recipe for Apple Crisp that my second graders enjoyed making.  This book would make a reat addition to any primary classroom.	2003-08-23

I teach in a 2nd grade classroom and the children are just beginning to have regular spelling lessons and homework.

Each chapter gives strategies and routines that help kids focus on learning and help the teacher create a classroom that hums with productivity.  I have taught both 1st and 4th grades and have found this book useful at both levels.  There are lots of black line masters (some of which I used &quot;as is&quot; and others I adapted for my own situation) that help children and teacher be organized.  This book is a winner!	2003-08-09

I really like the way the author ties literature and math together. She uses many books familiar to primary classroom teachers (for example, Moja Means One, The Very Busy Spider, Caps for Sale, and over 35 others) to introduce, teach, and review math concepts.  I would strongly recommend this bok for any primary level classroom teacher.	2003-08-09

I love the way the book is set up.  Each activity clearly states materials needed and procedure.  An important piece for me is the &quot;Teacher information&quot; section which gives some necessary background or supplemental information to the teacher.  There is also a section called &quot;For problem solvers&quot; which takes kids (and teacher) to a deeper level.  This book is a winner!	2003-08-09

The illustrations are simple line drawings that don't distract from the text.  In my primary classroom, we do many rhyming activities as a prelude to reading.  I found this vast collection of Mother Goose rhymes to be a strong resource.  I am able to use different verses for either different themes or different vowel/consonant sound work.  It might not be the kind of book that you cuddle up on the couch with but it will be very useful in the classroom	2003-08-09

The pictures selected are clear and engaging for children and my kindergarten students have enjoyed making their own \\"I Spy Two Eyes\\" books.	2003-08-08

The focus is on trade books and helping beginning readers become successful and independent readers of these books.  There are plenty of activites that are tied to familiar trade books.  I have used the suggestions and seen my students become more confident and self assured readers.  I think it is particularly useful for the kindergarten or first grade classroom teacher or for use in remedial programs.	2003-08-06

I love the way the book is organized.  You get the background information on thirty nine different multicultural authors and illustrators of books for children.  There are brief summaries of books written and illustrated by the writiers and artists highlighted and then there are suggested acitivities to go with the books.  The book has given me new ideas to help the students in my class broaden their world view.  I recommend it to any classroom teacher who wants to plan lessons that emphasize multicultural awareness.	2003-08-05

I have used this book in working with both first and second grade classes.  I really like the way the units tie literature and math together.  Lessons are well organized and include an overview, areas of emphasis, procedure, and extensions.  Many of the activites foster problem solving skills and all feature mathematical language.  There are mathematical activites for 18 well known primary level books (from Caps for Sale to Millions of Cats to The Relatives Came and 15 others).

The illustrations are whimsical and detailed enough to hold the children's interest when they \\"read\\" independently. There is one short sentence per page (For example: Ray steamed pots of rice.)so that young readers can build reading confidence with this book. If you are a fan of alphabet books, pigs, and/or food (after all, it is an accounting of a  \\"pignic\\" ), you will enjoy this book!	2003-08-05

The children also created delightful portraits of &quot;Wild Child&quot;.  I loved the way Wild Child suggested that a sibling would be coming along and, sure enough, here comes Winter!  Winter Waits is equally beautiful and depicts a tender father/child relationship not unlike the Mother/child relationship in Wild Child.

I also work full time and have two teenagers in the house.  Believe me there is little time to focus on fashion!  What I  liked about the book was the author's very positive slant on being over 40.  She is realistic in expressing the thoughts and confusions of this decade  -- especially insofar as looking one's best.  What was less than favorable  was the assumption that the reader has plenty of  disposable income and a  lot of time on her hands (neither of which is true in my life and in the  lives of my co-workers).  Many of the &quot;hints&quot; were really rather  common sense ideas.  Other hints required money and time to truely pull  off. Overall, I'd recommend the book beccause I liked the portrayal of the  40+ year old woman.  I'd think twice about suggesting it to someone who  wants to get fashion savvy but has little extra money or time.	2000-04-28
