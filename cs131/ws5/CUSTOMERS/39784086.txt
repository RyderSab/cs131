I could not tear myself away from it. It grabbed me by the throat on the first page, and I am still trying to catch my breath. <br /> <br />The story takes place on Humanity's last day. A Meteor is heading straight for Earth, and nothing can be done to stop it. The story follows a young man named Sean, and his struggles. His physical struggle to reach is ex girlfriend before the Meteor hits, and his mental struggle to find God, and the meaning of Life. You witness the worlds last few hours through his eyes.  <br /> <br />This story made me laugh, almost cry, and laugh some more. It was a true pleasure to read. I have to say that this is one of the best Apocalyptic stories I have ever read. I hated to see this book end. Eric is one heck of a Storyteller. He knows how to write a story that will stay with you long after you finish it.  <br /> <br />I recommend Its Only Temporary to anyone that wants to read a adrenaline packed story that is at the same time very deep and beautiful. <br /> <br />It will stay with me for a very long time.	2005-08-09

Twisted Loneliness is as hardcore as it comes. It is a Short Story collection that will have you fighting back the bile in your throat. I wouldn't suggest picking it up unless you have a very strong stomach. <br /> <br />Joe was kind enough to send me a signed copy, and after finishing it I will say that Joe is right up there with Edward Lee, Wrath James White, and Monica J. O'Rourke. He knows how to write a story that will make you squirm in your seat. <br /> <br />There was stories like The Closet that almost made me vomit, and others like The Puzzle, that were truly haunting and beautiful, and still others like Ollie and the Monster and Death Metal that creeped me out. Joe knows how to make you go through a Roller Coaster of emotions while your reading his work, and that is a sign of a really great Writer.  <br /> <br />I recommend Twisted Loneliness to anyone that can handle it. It is Hardcore to the Extreme. It will stay with me for a long time.  <br /> <br />Thanks Joe for some truly unpleasant memories. <br /> <br />You Rock. <br />	2005-07-27
US	39784086	R33C67ZRG3MGGW	0843946903	934186299	One Rainy Night	Books	4	1	2	N	N	My first Laymon story, but it won't be my last.	I am a huge Horror fan, but for some reason I never got around to reading any of Laymon's work, and in all honestly I don't know why. People that I know who has read his work told me that One Rainy Night is where I should start. I have to say that I really enjoyed this story.    It had my interest from the first page. The action starts early and never lets up. I wouldn't suggest starting it unless you have a lot of time to spare. You will not be able to put it down. I couldn't peel myself away from it.     I thought the story was very original. A black rain starts falling on a town, and anyone who gets it on them turns into a Bloodthirsty Maniac. Anyone with the misfortune of being in close proximity to someone whose been caught in the rain pays dearly. I must warn that the gore level is very high in this story. I wouldn't suggest anyone with a weak stomach reading it. It gets very graphic in parts.    The only real complaint I have is that Mr Laymon didn't devote enough of the story on what was causing the rain. You will find out the reason, but he doesn't go into a lot of detail, and that really frustrated me. I also felt like the ending was a little rushed. I think that the story should have be at least twenty pages longer.    I really enjoyed One Rainy Night. It is face paced, and very gruesome. I recommend it for anyone who likes No Holds Barred horror.	2005-07-17
US	39784086	R2WT5ZDKY0L1CX	1894815351	828183909	Suffer the Flesh	Books	5	3	6	N	N	You've been Warned	I will start by say don't buy this book if you have a weak stomach. It takes Hardcore Horror to the limit. There were scenes in Suffer the Flesh that had me squirming in my chair. There were even a couple scenes were I almost lost my lunch, and I have a very strong stomach. <br /> <br />The Story is very scary and intense. I was wrapped up in it from the first page. A Woman is kidnapped, and forced to endure some of the most vile and painful Tortures imaginable. She is literally taken to her physical and mental breaking points. My heart poured out for her. The story also moves at an incredible pace. I flew through the pages.  <br /> <br />The Characters in this story were well developed. I found myself loving some, and completely loathing others. I especially loved Zoey, and Claudia. They seemed to jump out of the pages. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Suffer the Flesh. Monica has a knack for writing some of the most Hardcore Literature out there. I wouldn't suggest this book to just anyone. Monica doesn't pull any punches. She doesn't leave anything for the imagination, but with that being said if you can handle Brutality, and Extreme Sexual Perversion you will love this story. <br /> <br />Five Stars  <br /> <br />	2005-06-28
US	39784086	R2D8MD17XN2FJB	0843955430	713197310	The Girl Next Door	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Unforgettable	I really didn't know what I was getting myself into when I started this story. I had people tell me that it will stick with you. It would brand itself into your brain, and that it wasn't for the faint hearted. Boy where they right. The Girl next Door is one of the most powerful and disturbing stories I have ever read. I was consumed from the first page.    The story was intense and heartbreaking. It moves at an incredible pace. I flew through the pages anticipating yet dreading what was waiting for me on the next one. I could not put it down. I finished it in two sittings.     I think the best part of the story though was that the Monster was Human. It scares me to know that people like this could actually exist.     The characters in this story were unbelievable. They were as real as any I have ever read. I found myself completely loathing Ruth's character. I developed a hatred for her that I have never had for any character in any other story I've read.     I will never forget The Girl next Door. I have to say I almost cried at the end of this story, and that has never happened to me before. It will haunt me for a long long time. I recommend this it to anyone who has the courage to read it. I can promise you you will never forget it. It was like my friend said. It will brand itself into your Brain.    The Girl next Door will stay with me for the rest of my life.	2005-06-24
US	39784086	RWXU8WTL1BDSX	1554041635	230975227	The Legacy	Books	4	9	9	N	N	A fun and fast paced Horror Novel	I will start by saying that I loved Brian's other novel Species so I was expecting great things from The Legacy. I was not let down at all. The Legacy had me in suspense from the first page. It starts fast and doesn't let up. I found myself engrossed in the story. It asks the question. <br /> <br />\\"What would you do if you found out you were the Antichrist\\".  <br /> <br />I thought the story was really interesting, and had real depth. It sucked me in, and didn't let go. I liked how he gave real detail to the settings and situations. He put you in that world. You feel like you are there witnessing it first hand. <br /> <br />I also thought the characters had real depth. They weren't wooden at all. I really connected with the main character Luke. He jump out of the page.   <br /> <br />There is also a real nice twist at the end. It really shocked me. My jaw literally dropped when I read it.  <br /> <br />I recommend The Legacy to anyone who is looking for a good Horror Tale. I really enjoyed the story and characters. It moves really fast, and the ending in incredible.	2005-06-19
US	39784086	R2P6H62QTGLBVW	0553587382	704948528	Terminal	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A gripping and powerful story.	I picked Terminal up because I loved The Rising, and City of the Dead. I love Brian's writing style. It is fast, and to the point. He doesn't drag scenes out. He makes you understand whats happening without boring you. Terminal was no exception. It moved fast, and never bogged down. I found myself tearing through it. <br /> <br />The story was completely original, and the characters were well developed. Every character in this story came alive to me. I didn't find one that was wooden. Tommy and Benjy had to be my personal favorites. I fell in love with them. They seemed so real, and honest. Terminal will stay with me for a long time. It was haunting and sincere. You will find yourself wondering what you would do if you were put Tommy's shoes.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend Terminal. It is one of the best stories I have read in a long time. I can promise you that if you pick it up you will love it. I wish I could give it Ten Stars.  <br />	2005-06-12

It was truly a pleasure to read.  <br /> <br />The story starts off fast and never lets up. I loved the pace of this book. I found myself flying through it, and I was sad to see it end. I was really wrapped in the story.  <br /> <br />I thought that the characters were very well developed, and I didn't find any of them wooden or stale. I found myself falling in love with some, and loathing others. I think the character development was one of the strongest aspects of this story. <br /> <br />The part I think I loved most though was the story itself. It is a whole lot deeper than I expected to be. I realized about a hundred pages in that I was going to be getting a whole lot more than I bargained for. It is very original. I think the cover was very deceiving on this one.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend House of Blood to anyone who loves a good Horror Novel with a twist. I think if you give it a try you will like it as much as me. <br /> <br />Five Stars	2005-05-28
US	39784086	R12UGW1PBH3116	0843954159	160204437	City of the Dead	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Believe the Hype	I will start by saying that I loved The Rising, but the ending really frustrated me. It just came to an abrupt stop. I was hoping that Brian would give a sequel, and did he ever.  <br /> <br />City of the Dead is one of the greatest Horror Novels I have ever read. I think in some ways it surpassed The Rising, and that is rare for a sequel. <br /> <br />The action starts from the first page and never lets up. You will find yourself not being to pull away. I found myself being consumed in it for hours at a time. I would read till my eyes hurt, and my butt went numb. I just could not put it down. <br /> <br />The story picks up exactly where The Rising left off. It moves at an incredible pace. It NEVER lags. It is one hell of Rollercoster ride.  <br /> <br />The characters are very thought out, and believable. Ob was my favorite villain of any book I have ever read. Jim and Danny though were my favorites throughout these two stories. I have to say they are my favorite characters of any book I have ever read. Brian made them come to life in a way that is hard to explain. It shows what lengths a Father will go to to save his Son. Pick up The Rising and City of the Dead and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br />The gore abounds in City of the Dead also. It is not for those with a weak stomach. Brian doesn't pull any punches in this one. It is Hardcore to say the least.  <br /> <br />To sum it up City of the Dead will to go down as one of my personal favorites. I didn't have one complaint with this novel. I wish I could give it Ten stars. <br /> <br />I recommend City of the Dead to anyone who loves a great Zombie or Horror story. I can promise it wont disappoint.	2005-05-26

A Plaque is sweeping the country. The Dead are rising and they are attacking and devouring the living. The Government is trying to contain it but with no success. Civilians are taking up arms and banding together in hopes of surviving the Zombie Apocalypse. George is going to try to make it home, but it wont be easy. he will have to fight his way through a world gone crazy. Remnants of the Federal Government, and Military. Militia's with their own agenda's, and thousands of flesh hungry dead.  <br /> <br />Down the Road is set in the George Romero Zombie world. Society is collapsing. The government is trying to get things back in order by using a Iron Fist. America has become a huge War Zone. People are killing one another causing the numbers of the Dead to swell. The situation soon becomes hopeless. I am a sucker for a good Zombie Story and Down the Road did not disappoint. I could not put it down. The Zombies are described in great detail, and the Kills are very VERY graphic, but that is what you want in a good Zombie story. Bowie doesn't pull any punches. Down the Road isn't for the squeamish. I think the thing that I loved the most is how Bowie described just how ineffective FEMA would be in a major disaster. Down the Road was written before Hurricane Katrina and it is almost eerie how accurate he was. The only complaint I have is I wish it had been longer. I thought that some of the scenes were a little to rushed. I think that this book could have been a lot longer. <br /> <br />I recommend Down the Road to anyone who loves a good Zombie story. It is a great debut for Mr Ibarra, and I hope this isn't the last Zombie story we get from him.  <br />	2005-05-18

I loved Footfall so I thought I would like this as well. I gave up on it after 300 pages. <br /> <br />It was boring to me. It seemed like scenes dragged out forever, and even the comet hitting seemed boring. I found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters. They just seemed to wooden for me. <br /> <br />I cant recommend Lucifer's Hammer. It was a big bore to me.	2005-05-11
US	39784086	R149NNPQB0T4YQ	0972930930	577517367	Poisoning Eros	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Hardcore Horror in its purest form	It is hard on where to start on this one. Poisoning Eros has to be the most hardcore, gut wrenching, bile spewing story I have ever encountered, but with that being said I really enjoyed this book. It shows you a side of society that most of us will never see. It takes you to place where morals and common decency no longer exists. It shows you the limits that someone with a serious drug addiction will go for their next high, and at the same time it shows you that there are people out there that cant use addiction, or anything as an excuse for their perversions.     Poisoning Eros is a lot more than just a Shock Story. There is a much deeper meaning to it than that. Anyone who says different didn't get it. The story shows the limits that a mother will go to to protect her child. The horror and humiliation she will go through to save her child's soul. To even sacrifice her own soul.    I know some people that didn't like the ending, but I really did. I think is was fitting, and I think you can look at it and get different meanings. I think it was left for you to make your own ending, and I think it shows that life isn't fair, and we shouldn't think death will be any different.     I recommend Poisoning Eros to anyone who has the stomach for it. It is a really great story, and I think those who give it a chance will really enjoy it.    5 Stars all the way.	2005-05-11
US	39784086	R37J220NRJBSC1	0765309157	429802331	Judgment Day	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A fat fun Novel	I really enjoyed Judgment Day. It is a fat novel that moves really fast. I found myself stay up late at night unable to put it down. <br /> <br />I thought it was really interesting of how Mr. David gave certain Christian beliefs of the End Times a Sci-Fi twist. It was very original and you wont find another story out there like this as far as I know. <br /> <br />The complaints I have is that it seemed like Mr. David went out of his way to villianize all Left Wing organizations and their beliefs. I am not a person that pays much attention to politics, but it seemed that the Mr. David has some kind of a grudge against Liberals and their beliefs. There was a Far Right Conservative tone to this book that some people might not like. I also thought that there where some loose ends, and I hope Mr. David writes a sequel.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Judgment Day. The story was original, the characters believable, and it never got boring which is rare for novel that size.  <br /> <br />I recommend Judgment Day to anyone who liked Left Behind, or a good Sci-Fi story.	2005-05-06

I thought the premise of the story was really interesting, but I hated the characters. They were to wooden, and I didnt care what happened to them.  <br /> <br />I also have to say I didnt like the writing style either.  <br /> <br />I will give other books by Mr Lebbon a try, but I cannot recommend The Nature of Balance.	2005-04-06

I gave it two hundred pages to get my attention, but it just bored me.  <br /> <br />The characters didnt interest me in the least bit, and the story was just to slow. I went to sleep three times trying to read it. I just gave up after awhile.  <br /> <br />To all out there looking for a good Alien Invasion read I suggest Footfall, or The Forge of God. I just cannot recommend this book.	2005-04-06

A person on Brian Keen e's message board recommended it to me because I loved City Infernal so much. I was not disappointed at all. It was a well thought out and developed novel. It is one of the more unique novels I've read.     I think one of the most unique factors of it is that there isn't a Satan. It was really neat how the book developed without having that character.     I really enjoyed the love story that was in Letters from Hades also. I usually don't like love stories, but I really did this one. You find yourself thinking that you would do the same thing if you were in that position, or at least I did.     The only complaints I have is that it could have be longer, and that there isn't a sequel. It begs for one, and I hope Mr Thomas gives us one in the future.    I highly recommend this book. It is definitely a five star story.	2005-03-31

Flesh Gothic is another example of that. It takes off from the first page and wont let you go to the last word.     This book is not for the easily squimish. It is hardcore all the way.     I recommend that if you havent read any Edward Lee novels yet pick up City Infernal, and Infernal Angel first, and you will have a deeper appreciation for Fleah Gothic. You will get a deeper understanding for Flesh Gothics story line.     I only liked City Infernal more, but Flesh Gothic is right up there with it.     I highy recommend this book to any Lee fan, or anyone who likes a good hardcore Horror Novel.	2005-03-05

Swan Song stands as one of the greatest horror novels ever written in my opinion. It is over 950 pages long but you will find yourself tearing through them. <br /> <br />The story was very intriguing, and it sucks you in. I would sit hours at a time caught up in this story. I would read till my eyes dried out and started hurting.  <br /> <br />There wasn't a character in this story that I wasn't wrapped up in. They all seemed so real to me. There wasn't one wooden character in this book in my opinion. They all had a realness to them that some in other books don't have. <br /> <br />I HIGHY recommend Swan Song to anyone who loved The Stand, or any Horror fan for that matter. It is trip to a terrifying world that I can promise you will never forget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-04

It was extremely well written, and I found myself wrapped up in the characters. They were well developed and real. <br /> <br />The story was completely original, and very thought out. I love the twist that was put on the rapture. I found myself flying through the pages wondering what would happen next.  <br /> <br />The only complaint I have is I felt it ended a little abruptly. I wish it would have been a little longer at the end than what it was. I feel like he could have made the last 6 pages at least 20. That is the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. <br /> <br />That aside I highly recommend The Darkening to anyone who loves a good End of the World story. It will not disappoint. <br /> <br />	2004-12-15

The only exception is the ending. The book ends leaving you hanging. It leaves out about the last 15 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br />If you like books about aliens this is for you. I thought it was well written, and I really liked the characters.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't bother reading it though if you have seen the movie already. <br /> <br />I recommend for Sci-fi fans.	2004-11-22
US	39784086	R1ESSREYNKH94U	0843952040	875977385	Messenger	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Another great Lee Novel	I will start by saying that Edward Lee is without a doubt one of the most hard-core horror writers out there. His novels are as graphic as they come. People with weak stomachs shouldn't read any of his novels right after eating, but with that being said if you want a horror novel that will keep your attention from beginning to end grab a copy of The Messenger.    Lee has a way of developing characters and plot at a really fast pace. You will find yourself tearing through the pages wondering what's going to happen next.    The Messenger also has some of City infernal, and Infernal Angel aspects to it also, so if you liked those two books The Messenger will not disappoint.     I highly recommend The Messenger to anyone who likes hard-core horror.	2004-10-31

It had me hooked from the first page. Michael Mcbride knows how to write horror. I still cant believe how good this book really was. I read a lot of horror novels but very rarely do I ever get the creeps. Species gave them to me from start to finish. <br /> <br />The story is original and the characters are as well developed as any story as I have ever read. The suspense was the best part though. It was unbelievable. It will grab you by your throat and wont let go. <br /> <br />The only complaint I had was that is was to short, and it left you hanging, but I recently found out that it is going to be part of a trilogy. I cant wait for the next installment. <br /> <br />To whoever is reading this; if you like horror or sci-fi novels don't waste anymore time. BUY THIS BOOK NOW. I can promise you that you will not be sorry.  <br /> <br />Mr. Mcbride you got me hooked and wanting more. <br /> <br />	2004-10-20

I took it home and I was suprised. It is not your typical Nuclear War book. It takes place some years after a Limited Nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States. It follows two men, and there journey across whats left of the United States.     They interview a number of different people all across the country and find out what effect the war had on them and there communties.     I thought the idea of the US becoming basically a divided Third World Country interesting, and kind of disturbing.    This book isnt for action lovers though. There isnt any action in it, but it wasnt written to be a action book.    It is smart and well written, and I highy recommend it.	2004-09-25

I have to say I am a little disappointed. I was expecting more than I got from it. I thought that the story was good for the most part, and I really liked the Xombies. They were similar to the zombies on 28 Days Later. The first fifty, and last fifty pages of the book were really exciting and fast paced, but I have to say that the rest of it was kind of slow and boring to me.     I liked the concept of Agent X, and how it turned a person into a Xombie. I just wished it would have went into the World epidemic more than it did.     I Liked Xombies, but I just think it could have so much better, but I great first effort, and it is a good addition to the genre.     I would recommend it for anyone who loves Zombie End of the World books.	2004-09-25
US	39784086	R70ZUUXXAGFQA	0765301075	95465964	The Forge of God	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Very Good, but very Depressing also	I have to say I really liked Forge of God. It was really well written, and I thought the concept was brilliant. I think that it showed the truth that if there is an alien race out there that is advanced enough to reach us there wouldn't be much we could do to stop them from doing whatever they wanted to us.     The book does get very depressing as it goes on. You realize that the Earths fate has been sealed and there is nothing we can do to stop it.    I thought the book had a few slow parts and, the ending was bleak but, there is sequel out there so I hope we get our revenge. I will be reading it and hoping.    I recommend Forge of God to any sci-fi junkies out there.	2004-09-25

I thought that all the characters were well developed, and the story was very original. You wont get bored with this book, I can promise you that.     The last 20 pages has the be the best part though. The twist at the end will blow your mind.     Lee does it again. He is really proving that he is the most hard-core horror writer out there	2004-07-15
US	39784086	R1FTTHIZJO6TI7	0345323440	202451186	Footfall	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A Alien Invasion Classic	I found this book at a local used book store, and the owner said that if I liked Sci-fi I had to read this one. I have to say that he was right.  This is an alien invasion classic. It is a little dated but that wont matter once your start reading. I couldn't put it down.    I think what the aliens looked like was one of my favorite aspects of the book. They look like Elephants. The ending was heart pounding and clever also.    I highly recommend this book to anyone that's into Science Fiction	2004-07-15
US	39784086	R2C8OQZ3A3ZCR3	0843948256	677650953	Blood Crazy	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Original Story	I got to admit I was drawn in by the premise of Blood Crazy. Adults go crazy one day and start killing children. It is one of the most original stories I have read.     The characters are really developed, and the story moves at a good pace. You wont find yourself getting bored with this book. The ending was really satisfying, and it does leave room open for a sequel.    I recommend this book for anyone into Sci-fi, Horror, or anyone interested in a completely original story.	2004-07-15
US	39784086	RXZXTYF2RACPJ	0843950765	980952041	Stranger	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Not Blood Crazy but close	I am really into End of the World novels, and Stranger didn't let me down. I liked the storyline, and the pace of the book. I liked the characters, and the storyline most of all.    It isn't as good as Bloodcrazy though. It has some similar features that Blood Crazy had, but I felt that Stranger had some loose ends in it. You never fully understand the hives, and what man was evolving into, or at least I didn't.    That aside though I liked Stranger, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good End of the World book.	2004-07-15
US	39784086	R1BO3ES7YV8P8	0843952032	656018471	Infernal Angel	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Pretty good sequel	I just got done with Infernal Angel and I think that is a pretty good sequel to City Infernal. It has lots of action and suspense to go along with a solid story. Cassie returns to continue her quest to find her sister Lissa. I have to admit though that I was very disappointed that Via and Hush wasn't in the sequel. They really helped make City Infernal a great novel. I also wished Lee would have completely explained what happened to Ezoriel. I thought he would be one of the central characters in this book, but it never really brings him up. I was really disappointed by that, but those things aside if you liked City Infernal you wont be disappointed by Infernal Angel. It isn't quite and good as the first but it is very good in its on right.     There are a lot of new characters and its takes you to new parts of Mephistopolis. Lee is becoming one of my favorite writers.     I am just starting Monstrosity right now and if it is half as good as these two books were I know I will enjoy it.	2004-04-07
US	39784086	RXIM7WLZE3CYV	0523485476	884777688	Test of Fire	Books	2	6	10	N	N	Great beginning but falls flat after that	I found this book at my local library and it caught my eye. I started on it and I was completely engrossed for about halfway through it, but then it fell completely apart. It seemed like the writer just ran out of ideas which is sad because this could have been a 5 star book.     The concept is original and the story starts off fast, but after about page 150 it just gets very boring. The ending is completely dumb and every character is cold and shallow to a point were you really don't care who lives or dies.     I still have to give it 2 stars though because the concept was cool and the beginning was great.	2004-04-07

I couldn't find one flaw with this book. Orson Scott Card is a leader of the Science Fiction genre.     The story is wonderfully good and the characters are superb.     To anyone out there who has never read Science Fiction and is thinking about it. Enders Game is where you should start.	2004-03-19
US	39784086	R16XOR73ZWO165	0441009816	113566570	DeathDay	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Good Alien Invasion reading	I see a lot of people really didn't like for this book and I don't understand why. It is a little slow in parts but interesting nonetheless. I thought that the aliens were intriguing and the characters are very developed. The story moves at a decent pace for the most part.    One only real problem I have with this book is that it doesn't really describe the aliens technology a whole lot. Maybe it is in the sequel. I recommend this book. I think it is a pretty good Alien Invasion story and I look forward to reading Earthrise.	2004-03-19

This book stands heads and shoulders above all other books in its genre. The story is superb. The characters are developed and the battles are unbelievably real. Mr. Harry has made in my opinion one of greatest war books ever. He writes in a style all his own. I could go on and on but all I can say is BUY THIS BOOK and you wont be sorry.	2004-03-19

It isn't quite as good as the first but it is a good novel nonetheless. I thought that it could have been longer than what is was but, the storyline is solid, and the action is great. Len Barnhart is a horror master. He is one of the best Zombie Horror writer out there. He knows how to get your attention from the first page.     He is making a prequel to the Reign of the Dead books and I cant wait for it. If you love zombies you wont be disappointed.	2004-02-25
US	39784086	R180Z9BGYSIQNF	0741405563	328081149	The Dead	Books	5	12	13	N	N	A true classic	The Bible prophecy of the end of days have come and our world is doomed. The Sun is dimming and it looks like it is rotting in the sky. The Rapture has happened taking the faithful to Heaven but leaving countless people behind. The unlucky souls who still remain on this dying earth are in store for something that even their worst nightmares couldn't have prepared them for. Satan and his fellow Demons have been unleashed from the bowels of Hell upon the earth where they are possessing the bodies of the Dead. The Fallen ones wander the streets in the rotting flesh of the dead seeking to destroy all of the unlucky ones that were left behind. A group of survivors led by two brothers journey though the streets of New Jersey hiding from the legions of Dead all the while trying to make sense of this world gone mad. As their numbers dwindle and the situation becomes more and more hopeless they will soon learn that their salvation is no longer in their hands.     The old world is gone and The Dead have inherited the Earth.    Ever so often I come across a story that is truly unforgettable. One that haunts me long after I am done reading it. One that makes me want to go back and reread it over and over again. One that I wish I had the talent and skill to write. The Dead is such a story. Over the years I have read this book of Mark Rogers four times and I get something new from it every reading. It has easily become one of my favorite books. The Dead is the ultimate Apocalyptic tale that will grab you by the throat on the first page and never let go. Mr. Rogers crafted a Zombie Classic that has become on of the classics of the Genre. I have read just about everything the genre has to offer and while I have really enjoyed some of the other titles only two books have stayed with me through the years. One is The Rising by Brian Keene and the other is The Dead. To me these two books are the standard bearers of Zombie genre. I long for the day another story grabs me the way these two did.     To sum up I highly recommend The Dead to all Horror fiction fans. It is a classic that has stood the test of time. I can promise that if you give The Dead a chance you will not be disappointed.	2004-02-25
US	39784086	R3VY2DQBHOEZ03	0843952016	34858117	The Rising	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A Horror Masterpiece	The Rising is a novel that grabs your by the throat and wont let got to the last page.     It brings a new concept to the zombie genre. They are intelligent and very evil. They hate humans because we exist. They will not rest until every last one of us is dead.    I think the part of the story I loved the most though had to be the main characters \\"Jim\\" love for his son \\"Danny\\". Jim is willing to go through Hell on Earth to get to him.     You also find out that the Zombies aren't the only thing to fear in this new world. There are People out there that are just as evil.     The ending of the book really made me mad. It just came to a stop. I was wondering if I was missing pages, but later I found out that a sequel was in the works. I am excited about where this story is going to lead.     I can go on and on but all I can say is go pick you up a copy. You wont be disappointed.	2004-02-25
US	39784086	R2V5MI1J4G2BXZ	0515128422	849436629	Invasion	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A very scary What If	I have been a long time lover of Eric's books. This is my favorite of them all. Arc Light was more believable but this was a very scary what if scenario that could lie in our future.     The 2 main flaws I found with this book was that it hardly mentioned anything about an air war. We have the most advanced airforce in the world, WHAT HAPPENED to it, and the second. Where was Russia in all this? It never says one thing about the red army in all this but, other than that this book is a must read for any fan of war books. The charters are well developed in this book. You will have ones you love and others you hate. I really do hope there is a sequel to this because it was left wide open for one at the end. A must read for any action junkie out there. Mr. Harry makes you wonder if one day the Sleeping Dragon of the East will awaken and try to devour the Eagle of the West. I highly recommend this book.	2002-07-15

This book was very scientific to the point to where if you haven't study genetics for the past 4 years you could go completely brain dead trying to figure out what they are trying to explain. It focused on the scientific to the point to where it doesn't really develop any of the characters in the book. It is a very scary what if scenario, but it never really explains some things for example (WHERE DID ALL THE INSECTS GO). They just disappeared.    The action at the end of the book is intense but it is over before it really even develops. It had the potential to be a great science fiction novel but just didn't really deliver to me.    However I do recommend this book. It is a good novel of how humanity can be destroyed without a bomb going off. uhhhhh wait there are bombs also for you actions fans lol. All in all a good book, but only 3 stars here.	2002-07-15
US	39784086	R1PXG5ATIZR75W	0515111155	439744906	Wet Work	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good Zombie reading	Let me start by saying this book is a classic for any zombie fan but I have always been a George Romero fan and these zombies were not what I expected.     In this book there is different stages of dead if that makes sense. Some of the dead in this book can drive cars and function almost normally, but others are less intelligent and have hard times doing basic tasks. The whole scenario of a comet passing over and killing the immune system of the living and bringing the dead back to life was really cool but it wasn't totally original. Watch the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET and you will know what I am talking about. The book was a little short and very bleak at the end. It leaves no hope for humanities survival, but a great book all in all. I recommend this book highly but only 4 out of 5 to me.	2002-07-15
US	39784086	RCRVULQ07CURG	0446365157	299484438	The Black Mariah	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A SUPERB horror novel	I found this book at a yard sale and on the book it said George Romero was turning it into a movie. I had always been a huge Romero movie fan so I thought why not. I bought and I read this book in 3 days. I couldn't put it down. The plot was very original. The characters are well developed and the storyline never lags. I don't want to give any of it away but if you are a horror fan (GET THIS BOOK) You will not be sorry.     The only thing that I hate is that George Romero I don't guess is going to do the movie of it now. A shame because it could have racked in lots of money at the box office.	2002-07-15

I got Reign around three days ago and I have about only fifty pages left and the only downfall to this book is it isn't long enough. I cant put it down. I cant wait for the next installment. I love how Len doesn't drag scenes out. He gets to the point, but you really understand the situation. You will find that towards the end of the book you almost feel sorry for the dead. You will find that this book is more than just horror. It has romance, action, and drama. It is a must read for any Zombie nut or for that matter any fan of the horror genre. I still cant believe this is his first book. I cant wait to see where is writing career goes. I must say my favorite zombie book had been WET WORK, but now I got a new favorite. Len cant wait for the sequel.	2002-06-26
