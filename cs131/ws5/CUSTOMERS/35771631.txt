US	35771631	R16QQKFSXNAOAM	0929605489	194244729	Captain Salt in Oz	Books	3	1	3	N	Y	Not much Oz	L. Frank Baum set a precedent early on for having Oz stories that take place mostly outside of Oz. Even so, they always wound up back in the famous fairyland at some point. This volume doesn't even do that. Oz appears only at the periphery. <br /> <br />The story brings back some of Thompson's characters from a previous volume. Captain Salt has been designated as the royal explorer of Oz and he stops of to pick up King Ato of the Octagon Isle to serve as his cook as he goes off exploring. Roger the Read Bird also has to come along to keep things stirred up. The crew sets off on a voyage of discovery and, of course, adventure. Oz only appears as the imperial power claiming the new lands. <br /> <br />Early on, the explorers pick up a young prince being held captive by savages and his guardian hippo. The young prince turns out to be the king of another fairyland on a legendary continent and the crew sets out to restore him against the wishes of the usurpers. <br /> <br />Thompson usually does well with her own characters as opposed to using Baum's. That is marginally the case with this book as well but it does not read as well as most of her others. It is a fair story but nothing to get overly excited about. <br />	2005-10-11

Things are not going well for the imperial loyalists so the captain of the Imperial ship of the line \\"Dahak\\" takes drastic action ensuring that even if he dies, the mutineers will not succeed. The problem is that the mutineers are led by the chief engineer who has some technical savvy of his own. The destruct sequence is begun and all of the rats abandon ship and head for shelter on the nearest planet. That would be earth. The mutineers' plans to reclaim the ship, however, are thwarted and the mutineers are stranded.  <br /> <br />All of this took place over 50,000 years ago. Since then, the mutineers have subtly controlled the progress of the earth by means of such events as the Hundred Years War, the World Wars, Pol Pot and other such unsavory characters (they are BAD). A desperate group sucked into the mutiny fights a rearguard action for all these millennia. Meanwhile, the ship of the line, devoid of any crew, carries out repairs and hides itself as the moon. All of this is just prolog for the real story. <br /> <br />The ship Dahak cannot fulfill its final commands without a crew. It manages to kidnap an earthman, train him as captain and swear him in as an Imperial officer. It is then up to him to resolve the mutiny and, not incidentally, prepare for invading aliens. To do this, our gallant hero is going to have to wipe out political terrorists and quash corrupt politicians. The result is a wild but fun romp filled with action and intrigue.  <br /> <br />This is a book where it is hard to \\"suspend the disbelief\\" but managing to do so is worthwhile for its entertainment value. This is a quick and frivolous read but it is fun. <br />	2005-10-11

The story and the options are just as horrific and the consequences are just as bad.  <br /> <br />Humanity and its allies face a war to the end with a race that will either eat every race it comes across or die trying. They cannot be negotiated with. They can either be killed or allowed to win. Killing them is not easy because they don't care about their own casualties. They have only a hunger and nothing can assuage it. <br /> <br />The space battles are well though out as is the strategy presented. They should appeal to fans of space battle. Like the predecessor, however, the real story concerns the hard choices of the leaders. <br /> <br />This is not a fun book to read but it is interesting and worthwhile. It also leaves open the possibility that more bugs will appear in later volumes. <br />	2005-10-08

It seems like the skinks are back and the men of the 34th will have to face them again so they ship out ready to rock and roll. Things are not, however, as they seem. If I said any more, I'd be giving away vitals so I won't. There is, however, an additional enemy. <br /> <br />We are introduced to Admiral of the Starry Heavens Orange, the supreme naval commander of the We're Here! Navy. We're Here! is a bush league planet settled early on by a bunch of hippies. His supporting characters include Admirals Toke, Head and Crashpad. Captain Happiness is also along for the ride. Admiral Orange gets it into his head that he needs to go to war with another planet and, not incidentally, the Confederation Marines. It's a comic opera that is hilarious in its ludicrous nature. <br /> <br />It's a relaxation break in the series. <br />	2005-10-08

Both have been previously published. This has caused some consternation from some people who believed they were getting something new and instead got something they already had. If you have not read either of them, however, it's a great deal. <br /> <br />They two included books are CRUSADE and IN DEATH GROUND. Individual reviews appear below: <br /> <br />CRUSADE <br />I am hooked on the Honor Harrington series. I have spent so much time reading them that, when I was done, I was disappointed because I had nothing else from Weber to read until the next one comes out. I forgot to check for some of his other works. I wouldn't have thought he would have time to write anything else. WRONG! <br /> <br />CRUSADE pits the human federation against a new alien species which considers itself saviors dedicated to saving Terra and humanity for the evil Orions who just happen to be uneasy allies of humanity. It takes a while to figure out how this strange turn of events came to be but, when it finally comes out, it makes sense. Religious zealots are at work promoting a jihad for personal advantage. Their only contact with humanity came at a time when it was at war against the Orions. <br /> <br />A major problem is that the Orions are a warrior culture and their alliance with humanity is an uneasy one. When the new aliens, the Thebans, are first encountered, it is the Orions they attack and they do so in the name of humanity. Resolving this is left up to humanity but the Orions are keeping a suspicious eye on the situation. <br /> <br />The battles are well thought out and fans of space battles will appreciate the book. Just as interesting are the political battles. For me, they are even more interesting to read. It's a good book worth the time. <br /> <br /> <br />IN DEATH GROUND <br />Humanity and its allies face a deadly enemy. That enemy is one so different that even communication is impossible withthem. Only a few things are really known. They look like giant spiders. They attack without warning. They are very powerful. They eat most of their victims. The rest they raise as livestock for future consumption. <br /> <br />The naval commanders charged with protecting humanity, and later the rest of the alliance, face terrible choices with frightening consequences. They can't save everybody. That means that the ones who are not saved are going to be eaten. They realize that throwing themselves into battle anyway just increases the odds that all of the allies will lose. Before they can fight the big battle, they must fight rearguard actions and marshal their forces. Whatever they do, people are going to die, people are going to be eaten and the nightmares will come. This book and its sequel do the best job I have ever encountered of pointing out the pain that can come with major commands.  <br /> <br />Its not a fun read but it is a good one. Its also a cliffhanger. <br />	2005-10-08

Finally, a time comes when the people will take it no more and the result is civil war. <br /> <br />This book makes clear that there are honorable people on both sides of the conflict but the horrors of war are such that innocents are bound to suffer. Like the other books of this series, the action sequences are well though out and well written but the main lessons come from choices faced by the protagonists.

It has none of the complexities of the Sharpe novels but I wouldn't expect that in a 67 page book. It is a simple action story where Sharpe's determination and refusal to lose win out over a superior French column. <br /> <br />The setting is a simple one. While recovering from a wound, Sharpe is assigned with is company to guard a commissary officer who is taking possession of some captured arms (and wine). No one except Sharpe expects trouble. They get it anyway. <br /> <br />The French decide to mount a raid behind the lines and Sharpe's detachment is all that stand between the peninsular armies and a military disaster. As everyone knows, however, Sharpe is too stubborn to lose. <br /> <br />It was a pleasant diversion. <br />	2005-10-08

It is a collection of two previously published works although there are reputedly about 20,000 new words included. If you already own either of the books, there is little reason to buy this volume. Otherwise, it is a good buy. <br /> <br />The two included books are THE SHIVA OPTION and INSURECTION.

The Greeks were notorious for not being able to get along with each other and therefore be able to work together. The Persian army greatly outnumbered that of the Greeks. Their navy too left little hope for a Greek victory. Even so, Themistocles managed to use guile and bring the Greeks together to win the most lopsided naval battle of antiquity. <br /> <br />Barry Strauss manages to achieve a nice balance of readability and information. His account reads more like a narrative than a dry historical recitation. It is a job well done. <br />	2005-09-24

Instead, it has much to do with the most celebrated marine of that unit, Gunnery Sergeant Charlie Bass. Two books ago he was ambushed while on patrol and presumed dead. Now he is back and his unit has left him behind on the planet of Kingdom. There are no credible threats from Skinks anymore but that is made up for by the threat from the bloodthirsty planetary government based on the worst of the Nazis. It's one very capable marine against a planet of neo-nazis. The bad guys are going to lose bigtime. <br /> <br />This is an exciting book with plenty of unexpected twists. I think it is the best of the series so far. <br />	2005-09-24

They are also still doing so with &eacute;lan, spirit de corps and good old fashioned jarhead toughness.<br /><br />The aliens are quite different than your normal science fiction fare. They are amphibians and instead of using fancy ray guns, they use acid. They are tough and utterly alien but they are also up against the finest military tradition on earth.<br /><br />The book feels the loss of Gunnery Sgt. Bass, apparently killed in the last volume, but there is reason for hope. A character who is probably him turns up for a few pages at the very end. Now I just have to wait for the next book to come in.<br /><br />It's a good story.	2005-09-21

I didn't not realize that it was part of this series. It was a good book and stands well on its own. This one does likewise. This volume is supposed to be the first in the series dealing with a quest for the Holy Grail. <br /> <br />You would not realize how the Grail features in the story from this book. It centers around an effort during the Hundred Years War to recover the lance of St. George. It grail comes up only very peripherally. All this stuff about lances and grails is just window dressing, though. The real story is a human one. <br /> <br />Thomas of Hookton is an archer. He is a fighting man embroiled in a war. In short, he is the kind of character that Cornwell handles so well. It is an interesting read and will most likely teach you some vocabulary a well. <br />	2005-09-21

That is an impression I retained right up until the last page. Then I had second thoughts. I still like it immensely. It still probably my favorite of the series but I was let down by the cliffhanger ending. <br /> <br />The story picks up as the bad guys are planning for an invasion. If they manage to pull it off, its all over for the forces of freedom. What stands in the way of the New Destiny (bad guy) forces is Duke Edmund Talbot and his aide, Herzer Herrick. The duke is given command of the naval forces in an attempt to hold off what seems inevitable. As Wellington said, it was a near run thing. <br /> <br />Ringo again does a superb job of taking the fantastic and making it seem plausible. The background of his world is a highly advanced society that falls into chaos through a civil war. Before the anarchy, genetic manipulation could let people assume almost any form they wished. Teleportation was literally a wish away. Energy was a problem for no one. After the fall, energy is in short supply and people fall back to a pseudo-medieval state. A few people still have access to high tech but most are stuck with a low tech life. They make due brilliantly. I can almost believe carriers propelled by sails and launching dragons instead of F-14s. The elves and dwarves make sense in this tableau. It's a lot of fun. <br /> <br />The only letdown came after the climax. It is a cliffhanger and we are set up for another book. That would not ordinarily be a problem except that I don't want to have to wait for the next book to come out.  <br />	2005-09-20

It was adequate but not up to the superlative quality I expect from L. Frank Baum. This book, however, sets things to right. It reads more like the Oz books and even includes characters such as Button Bright and Polychrome who make numerous appearances in the Oz series. It is a fun book that I enjoyed even with my youth far behind me. <br /> <br />In this story, Trot meets Button Bright who has a magical umbrella which takes him where he wants to go. Trot, Button Bright and Cap'n Bill decide to use the umbrella to take them for a picnic out on an island just off the coast. Instead of being taken to that island, however, they wind up on and island in the sky inhabited by tow warring peoples. Our characters wind up in the middle and have to set everyone straight. <br /> <br />It is a delightful tale which should appeal to both boys and girls. <br />	2005-09-12

They can't seem to catch a break from the higher brass, their Justice Department, their politicians or even a resort world. <br /> <br />HANGFIRE actually consists of several plotlines, most of which will presumably be hashed out in later books.  <br /> <br />The first plot concerns the way the normal duty rotations of the 34th out of the unit (a hardship post) seem to have come to a complete halt. The CO takes it upon himself to investigate this matter for the good of the morale of his men and no one will like the answers. The main thrust of this one is of a senior CO looking after his men. He learns the reasons but it will be left to later books to see how he handles the situation and how his men react. <br /> <br />The second plot concerns the alien \\"Skinks\\" first encountered in the 4th volume, BLOOD CONTACT. We see the skins gearing up for some major nastiness against humanity but this is almost entirely independent of the real story being told in this book. Again, it seems to be a matter of setting things up for stories to come. What is incredible is the amount of space dedicated to setting it up since it does nothing to advance the main plot of this book. <br /> <br />The third but main plotline concerns an independent assignment given to 3 marines seconded to the justice department. They are to infiltrate an exotic and expensive resort world run by the mob in order to gather evidence for the feds. Since the Justice department is calling the shots, we are guaranteed that things will be set up so as to put the 3 marines into as much hot water as possible with too little regard for the lives of the marines in question. In that respect, its pretty realistic. The marines manage, as marines do, to come through it all with physical and emotional wounds but with the mission accomplished. <br /> <br />All in all, this is not a bad installment. It seems a bit disjointed at times but I suspect that is less problematical for me since I am reading the series in close succession. <br />	2005-09-12

All we knew was that it would not be good for humanity or the marines. We learn more in this book and it is not good for either. <br /> <br />Once again, Sherman and Cragg demonstrate a liking for pursing widely variant plotlines simultaneously. They did an adequate job of this before but their skills are improving in this one. <br /> <br />The main plot involves the committal of the 34th FIST to action on the world of Kingdom. They think they are headed in to suppress a peasant revolt but it turns out that it is the skinks who are the cause of the problems and they are major problems. To make matters worse, Kingdom is a theocracy and the marines must face a local government that is as potentially dangerous as the real enemy. Just to keep the pot stirred up, there are also dissident elements at work within Kingdom that have a strong desire to hurt the marines, the Kingdom government, the confederacy and anyone one else who disagrees with them. To make matters worse, many do not believe in the aliens the marines are fighting and believe it all to be some sort of convoluted plot. <br /> <br />The second plotline concerns Captain Coronado, CO of L Company. A few volumes back he was involved in a hush-hush operation dealing with another alien sentient species. In that book, he did the right thing, against the cruel and inhumane orders of the scientific leader of the post, and is returning to earth to face court martial. This puts strains on his family situations in ways recognizable to anyone who has ever tried to serve both a family and the military. Needless to say, the gallant captain has his own adventures along the way and improvises, adapts and overcomes....just the way a good jarhead is expected to do. <br /> <br />This is actually probably the best book in the series so far. There are a few surprises and newtwists. Its going to take at least one more book and some significant reinforcements to get the marines out of this mess. <br />	2005-09-12

The characters continue to develop in complexity and their lives become even more complicated. An empire-wide civil war just makes matters worse for those involved. The result is a good story and bad times for galactic civilization. <br /> <br />In this installment the two major protagonists are reunited for a brief time only to have their personal foibles drive them apart. Each goes his/her own way and puts all available energies into fighting the war. Martinez does so with the fleet in space and Sula does so as a ground pounder. Each is extremely competent and each faces unexpected troubles.  <br /> <br />I'm ready now for the next book. <br />	2005-09-08

It was surprising but nicely handled.<br /><br />This time the jarheads are sent to an ultra secret planet to fight smugglers. The existence of this planet is known to only a few at the highest levels of government because the natives there are intelligent but very far behind humanity in terms of development. Think in terms of nomadic hoards. There is a sort of \\"Prime Directive\\" at work in which the decision has been made to let the culture develop naturally. There are a few problems with this. The natives produce some extremely valuable gemstones which makes smuggling worthwhile and the head scientist is doing nasty experiments on the natives. When the marines are sent in to stop things, they have their hands full.<br /><br />Instead of being action packed, this book spends more time on story development. That didn't bother me but those who don't want the shooting to cease may be a bit disappointed.<br /><br />I would have given this book a fifth start where it not for one thing. It seems in many places to be temporally disjointed. There is a perception that some of the narrative is out of order. Sometimes it was a minor matter of the difficulty of telling two simultaneous stories. Other times it was more distracting in that I thought I was reading of subsequent events when actually I was reading of prior ones.	2005-09-03

Along the way, tutorials emphasize the important points and it was encouraging to actually get things done. The files that are needed are provided on the accompanying CD and were generally as depicted in the text; this is an exception to the general rule in my experience and very much appreciated. <br /> <br />All in all, I cannot claim competence in Pagemaker yet but I am a long way closer than I was when I started this tutorial 3 days ago. <br />	2005-08-30

Indeed, some of his works send readers running to the dictionary to look up obscure terms for armor, arms and tactics. Some may find that tedious but I find it fascinating. This book is no different in that respect. It is also a good story. <br /> <br />The action takes place in France during the Hundred Years War. The protagonist is an English archer charged with leading a group of men to take over a small town that was one the possession of an English noble. The real reason is that the noble suspects that there will be found information leading to the recovery of the Holy Grail. It seems that many others have the same idea and the situation is ready for medieval conflict: bloody, brutal and harsh. <br /> <br />One of the things that makes this an interesting book is the characterizations. Often, the \\"good guys\\" are found doing bad things for bad reasons. The \\"bad guys\\" occasionally have very laudable reasons for their actions. Things don't seem so simple when viewed through a medieval lens. <br /> <br />The title refers to the love interest of the protagonist. She is a girl falsely accused of heresy and condemned to burn. Instead of burning herself, she is rescued and inflames the libidos of various characters thus causing even more chaos and conflict. That much at least has not chanced since the Hundred Years War. <br /> <br />It is a good story and Cornwell does a good job of making the reader feel at home in times long past. <br />	2005-08-29

After some explanation, it guided me through a simple video editing project in the first chapter that worked and communicated some basic ideas. It got me excited about learning more and then it disappointed me bitterly. <br /> <br />The rest of the book does not teach the way the first chapter does. It does do a systematic and fairly thorough job of explaining things in the interface but the usable examples are few and far between. This works well for some people but not for me. I learn better by doing along with the reading. This guide is woefully inadequate for that. Still, it is a handy reference. It's too bad I will have to further my training elsewhere. <br />	2005-08-26

This one seemed a bit different. It's difficult to put your finger on it but its there. It is also a good read. <br /> <br />In the far future, humanity is a subject race along with many others. They are all ruled by a race called the Shaa. Though the conquest part is difficult, the actual civilization imposed by the Shaa is not too onerous and humanity and the other races prosper...and stagnate. The Shaa undertook their conquest with a sort of missionary zeal. They have an ideal called \\"the Praxis\\" which they strive to impose on everyone else. Everything is subject to the Praxis. <br /> <br />Slowly, the Shaa are dying off. Maintaining their empire and enthusiasm proves more difficult than they expected. As the book opens, the last of the Shaa is contemplating his own death. What gives solace is that he is certain that all will continue as it was before his death. Indeed, this seems to be the expectation of nearly everyone. A single race, though, has other ideas. They figure to become the new overlords and the stage is set of a civil war. <br /> <br />There are two main characters is this book. Both are low level naval officers even though they come from noble families. Neither is satisfied with their prospects for the future. War will change all that. It seems that competence will matter more than patronage. <br /> <br />It's a good read. I look forward to the next in the series. <br />	2005-08-25

The last book was alright but nothing too memorable. This one is. <br /> <br />The marines are recuperating from their hard fought campaign when they get work of a scientific outpost which has fallen silent. A single platoon is sent to investigate. What they find is what no one expected. Hostile aliens have taken over the place and killed everybody. These are the first intelligent aliens to be encountered in these writer's universe and they are strange. There is no negotiating with them. They are fanatics who fight to the end and immolate themselves rather than let the jarheads take any prisoners, dead or alive. The marines have their work cut out for them and are not helped by the glory hound naval officer who accompanies them.  <br /> <br />It is a good read from start to finish. It is not as well polished as some series but it keeps the interest and it portrays the men and their leaders as they should be portrayed. Semper  Fi! <br />	2005-08-23

This work is no exception and it is not written for United Methodists. It is an ecumenical work which explains the things from the Catholic perspective and the Reformation tradition and looks at all major shadings in between as well as a few others. In doing so, he treats everyone with respect. <br /> <br />Stookey looks at the historical development of the various theologies associated with the Eucharist. He then looks at areas of convergeance and divergence, all the while asking the question, \\"How does this compare with what is current practice and with Biblical warrant\\" Besides looking at the problems, he also looks at possible solutions and pays attention not only to the theology of the subject but also the pastoral ministry. This is a well rounded and well thought out book suitable as a text in a seminary or a text for a class of laity who are interested in such matters. He will completely satisfy no one but he will make all think. <br /> <br />This one sets a gold standard. <br />	2005-08-21

My impression is that it would be almost useless to teach someone how to use Premiere Pro. I still liked it. <br /> <br />I am no great video editor but I do have some, small familiarity and have learned some things from other books. Based on that experience, I doubt this book would have done much good at all in learning to operate the program. Where I found it useful is in its overview and presentation. It does a great job of explaining broad concepts and giving a feel for the capabilities of the program. It also give some of the very basics of the mechanics of how to edit. I suspect I will find this book useful as a continuing reference not to explain the particulars of how to do something but to explain conceptually what can be done. I will use it as a jumping off point to investigate specific topics in other books. <br /> <br />The illustrations in this volume are luxurious. They are full color screen shots and are big enough, barely, to see what is happening on the screen. How I wish other training aids had as nice visuals! <br />	2005-08-20

Once I did, it was well worth the effort. I had no such problems with EMERALD SEA and it was just as enjoyable. Some of the science is so far out that it seems the realm of magic. When coupled to entities like dragons, elves and the like, this just reinforces the perception but it all makes sense as presented by John Ringo. The disbelief is suspended and we are left with a good story. That is how this is supposed to work and it does. <br /> <br />John Ringo is known for his military SciFi and this series seems on the surface to be a stretch for him. It is not, though. He handles the disposition of his mer-folk troops as you would expect him to handle the disposition of whatever infantry he might have available and then adapts it a bit for the \\"wetter environment\\". It is interesting stuff but gets really fun when he begins to do things like re-invent carrier doctrine and procedures and adapt it for dragons instead of aircraft. It's a hoot. <br /> <br />The story is a continuation of his first. Duke Edmund and his aide, Herzer, are dispatched to the Caribbean to try and set up an alliance with the sea peoples in their war against the bad guys. The sea people are a bit reluctant to form any alliance but tend to be swayed by such outdated concepts as honor, integrity and the willingness of the other guys to do the right thing even after they have been turned down. It's nice to read about a situation where concepts like that are taken seriously. <br /> <br />John Ringo adds one more story to this book with the information that it will be important in stories yet to come. It is included as an independent novella and involves the daughter of one of the characters of EMERALD SEA. She has been captured by the head bad guy and put to work in his own personal harem. This story is much more sexual than is Ringo's normal wont but it is part of the story. At its end, we are left wondering what the young lady has up her sleeve (if she were allowed to wear any sleeves) and what chaos she has in store for the forces of evil. <br /> <br />This was a two for the price of one investment and either is worth the price of admission. <br />	2005-08-19

These aren't just any old aliens, these are nasty and powerful They have but one purpose. They want to harvest everything on earth so that it may be eaten. This includes the people. There is no arguing or reasoning with them. They are hungry and only death is the cure. It is them or us. <br /> <br />The aliens do have a few weaknesses and can be fought. To do this requires blood, steel and fortitude. It needs soldiers. Where are they to come from? Germany has a particular problem. Politically correct politicians have so emasculated the German military that they have no cadre to fall back on. There is a solution, however, but it is an ugly one and anything but politically correct. The technology exists to rejuvenate old soldiers. The decision is made to revive the Waffen SS. <br /> <br />This is not an easy decision and the novel makes it incredibly complex. There are some terribly evil characters from Germany's past and they are portrayed as such. There are also some good men who are glad to have an opportunity to try and redeem themselves and their past. The choice is simple: fight with every tool available including a revived SS or become Purina Alien Chow. <br /> <br />For some, the choice is obvious. Being dead is preferable to having anything to do with Nazis. For some, it goes even further. It is better to be dead than to have anything to do with such evil creatures as soldiers, any soldiers. Some politicians seek advantage by thwarting their own forces. Some people are just to nave to believe that THEY could be eaten. How could aliens who can fly to the stars possibly be warlike? <br /> <br />The action scenes are well written. The political scenarios are frightening and disturbing. They are frightening because I can picture people and politicians who would collaborate with the aliens. It is disturbing because I recognize some of the things that have been done in the name of Green politics or Red. There is evil in this world and some people refuse to believe it. <br /> <br />This book can be read as a science fiction military adventure or it can be read as a political and social commentary. It is best read as both. <br />	2005-08-16

On this score, it delivers. We learn more about the enigmatic Outsiders and their motivations, we learn more about the Pak and about the Puppeteers. We even learn a bit of explanation for the existence of the Ringworld. All of these make the book worthwhile. I just wish that the story which containted these snippets of information had been more enjoyable. <br /> <br />The story concerns two people from Earth on a suicide mission headed for Wunderland to fight the Kzin. Along the way, they are abducted by Outsiders and used as pawns for the purposes of the outsiders who are themselves just pawns for other beings. It is in the telling of this story that much background for Known Space is filled in. The problem is that the story starts out well and then just gets more and more abstruse. While incorporating cosmological physics the story degenerates to metaphysics. Part of this is due to the nature of cosmology itself. It is a weird science. Much of it, though, is just because the story is entirely too strange to be enjoyed, at least by me. <br /> <br />Still, I did enjoy having the gaps filled in. It was not a wasted day. <br />	2005-08-13

He wrote other books as well, though, and THE SEA FAIRIES is one of these. It has no connection at all to the OZ stories in its original issue. Oz fans will recognize, however, the two main characters of Trot and Capt. Bill. This book was their fist literary appearance. Later on, they were integrated into the Oz milieu.  <br /> <br />This story, I am sorry to say, is not one of Baum's best efforts. That being said, he sets such a high standard that this one is still pretty good. It is just not as good as his Oz books. The story seems a bit more simplistic but it still shows his love of wordplay and vivid imagination. <br /> <br />The plot is a simple one. Trot and Capt. Bill are taken by mermaids for a visit to their magical, undersea kingdom. They go not as prisoners but as honored guests. While there, they are temporarily given the tails of mer-beings to allow them to get around easier. They tour the realms of the Mermaid Queen and see some of the queer inhabitants of her domain. While on the way to visit her overlord, however, they are abducted by an evil wizard and must devote their energies to staying alive until they are either rescued or find a way to escape. <br /> <br />It is a good and uplifting story. It suffers only in comparison to Oz. <br />	2005-08-10

This is true not only in terms of story but of characterization as well. The characters are complex and compelling. <br /> <br />Harry has grown up a bit in each book. This is to be expected. In this one, however, he takes a giant step. Though still not an adult, he begins to act the part of an adult with all of the responsibility that entails. It means that he is more accomplished but it also means that he is not quite as carefree and that he takes things like responsibility, truth and honor seriously. This does not make him a perfect character. He can still have lapses of judgment but he has them knowing the consequences, or at least the possible consequences, of his actions. <br /> <br />The other characters are complex as well. Snape in particular is well developed. He is not the simple, one dimensional character of evil. In learning some of his story in this and in previous books, one can almost develop a sense of pity for him even while despising his behavior. Even at the end of this book, there is the feeling that there is more to Snape than just what we know so far. I look forward to learning more. <br /> <br />This story centers on Harry and Dumbledore trying to track down clues about Valdemort. These investigations go towards motivations as well as to means and weaknesses. Along the way, Harry is troubled and distracted by school, sport and girls. At many points, one gets the feeling that Valdemort and the forces of evil are easy to deal with compared to dealing with girls. Very realistic here. The proper amount of teen angst is combined with mature consideration. Sometimes the hormones win and sometimes they take a back seat. <br /> <br />This book was not as fascinating as the others but it is still well worth reading. Now the only problem is that I will have to wait for so long until the next installment. <br />	2005-08-08

They were not my very favorites but they did keep my attention. I guess that's why I'm a bit disappointed with this installment. It seemed a \\"situation normal\\" type of read. It was a fair story and kept my attention but did not do so to the degree that the earlier two did. Since there are many more left to go in the series, there is still hope. <br /> <br />In this story, the 34th FIST is deployed as part of a larger force in a full scale war against a planet led by a maniacal sadist who has reinvented the doctrine of armored warfare. These jarheads are going to fight tanks, something they have not trained to do in several centuries. The marines are to make an opposed landing, establish a \\"planethead\\" and hold for relief by the army. The overall commander is a political admiral who has a talent for making bad choices. A major bad choice is the site of the landing. Things just get worse when the army fails to reinforce the marines on schedule. That's bad enough but, when corrupt politicians get their oars in the water, things really go to hell. As I said to begin with, Situation Normal, All Fouled Up or SNAFU. <br /> <br />I still plan on reading the rest of the series but it is not as high on my priority list as it was. <br />	2005-08-06

I like gags. I guess it's a sign of a sophomoric mind but I really like disgusting ones that gross people out without ever really doing anything \\"bad\\". I also like to teach young kids tricks to play at the dinner table when out at fancy restaurants. I usually repent and offer not to teach the trick if a parent offers a suitable bribe. So it is that I thought this book might generate some laughs and even some revenue. <br /> <br />There are a few tricks in here worthwhile. The popping eyeball and the exploding zit both have a satisfactory degree of \\"yuk\\" mixed with \\"he didn't really do that, did he?\\" but most of them require more setup than can be achieved in a spontaneous setting. Worse, from my point of view, they come across as \\"Magic Tricks\\" even when they're being done. If you hand somebody a deck of cards and tell them to pick one, they have an idea that a performance is involved even if they have no idea what the trick is. The gags I look for are ones in which no one realizes that a gag has occurred until after it is over. As I said, a few of these meet that criterion. The rest are parlor tricks. <br /> <br />This book does a good job of teaching those tricks. Anyone can learn them. If that is your goal, you could do much worse. For what I was seeking, though, it did not have much. Still, it is written well and in an entertaining fashion. <br />	2005-08-03

This is not usually because I am unaware of \\"the answer\\" but rather because I struggle for a way to explain things that is both accessible and understandable while doing justice to the importance of the rite and to those who lack the \\"theological\\" background to follow my arguments. Stookey's book is going to make that job a lot easier. In it, he explains the reasons for the centrality of the baptismal act and also discusses its development through history. In doing so he frequently points out that the reason a certain practice is rejected (or retained) can often be at odds with the original reason it was adopted (or rejected). He does all of this in clear prose that is easy to understand. <br /> <br />Another wonderful aspect of the book is its explanations of differences in denominational beliefs and practices and points out in marvelous ways just how similar we all are just under the surface. I especially enjoyed when he pointed out that certain aspects of Pentecostal affirmation share the highest of the high church theology with Roman Catholic confirmation. <br /> <br />This book is not written with any single denomination in mind although it does gravitate towards the mainline liturgical tradition (Catholic, Episcopal, Methodist, Lutheran, etc.). Much reference is made to other traditions including non-liturgical ones as well. The underlying theme of all his discourse is to recover the centrality of the baptismal covenant, whatever the denomination. He suggests ways to do so and also includes descriptions of liturgies to accomplish that end. He does this fully realizing that not everything he proposes will go over well in every venue. <br /> <br />If I were to teach a class in sacramental theology, particularly one in baptismal theology, this would be a text of choice. <br />	2005-08-02

I had a hard time getting started on this one but it was worth the effort and turned into a real page-turner.  <br /> <br />I like Ringo's other works. He writes military science fiction well and does so with the knowledge of someone who knows something about the military and military culture. He also does so with a sense of humor and knowledge of history which is gratifying to one who knows to look for it. This time, it seemed as if he went off the deep end. I suppose he did but he took me along with him. <br /> <br />The story takes place in the far future in a utopian society where everyone has access to immense power to make their lives easier. Nano technology and genetics have progressed to the point where the early chapters seem more like magic than any sort of speculation based on rational thought. People can change themselves into dragons, elves or whatever else seems to strike their fancies. The government of the world, such as it is, is in the hands of twelve members of \\"the council\\". They are aided and overseen by artificial intelligences who mostly take a \\"let the humans work things out themselves\\" approach. It is all very idyllic until some members of the council attempt a coup. The result is a civil war but that is just the \\"easy\\" part. <br /> <br />There is an almost immediate crash of technology world wide. Survivors are thrown back into a pre-industrial way of life and where there is such chaos, there is never any shortage of bad guys to try and take advantage. This happens while the surviving Council members continue to wage a higher tech war against each other. <br /> <br />Although things seem utterly unbelievable at first for the reader, they do get better. Ringo does a good job of rationalizing the events of his story and filling in the background. The result is something that is believable and, more important, it is entertaining. <br /> <br />This looks to be the beginning of a highly entertaining series. <br />	2005-07-31

John Ringo pulls off a major juggling act in this one. The take a story of military invasion by particularly nasty aliens and embellishes it with high energy physics and straight forward infantry combat. Just to keep things unpredictable, he throws in some theology with a personal appearance by none other than God. That's a pretty ambitious undertaking. What's amazing is that he manages to pull it off in a credible manner. <br /> <br />This is certainly not Ringo's best work but it is readable and entertaining. That's why I buy the book. It was worth the price. <br /> <br />The story begins with a physics experiment gone wrong. The result is a portal opened up to another world. It's a particularly nasty world and the inhabitants there are delighted at the prospect of another place to conquer. The fight against the aliens is led by, surprise - a physicist, with the help of a Navy SEAL. Along the way, they manage to enlist the help of another race threatened by the same obnoxious aliens. So too do they get a helping hand from God. I'm not kidding. In the context of this story, it worked but it would surprise a lot of the profs from my seminary. <br />	2005-07-27

In the original installment of the Starfist series, the marines were sent to a backwater, neo-barbarian planet to lay down the law. In this one, they still get sent to a backwater but it is supposedly a relatively civilized place. The problem is that the upper crust, who called the marines to begin with, are as bad a lot as any of the insurgents the jarheads have been called on to fight. Fighting, however, is not their primary job description. Instead, they are to train the local forces how to do it for themselves. In short, they are advisors and we all remember how dangerous that can be.  <br /> <br />The marines have their work cut out for them. The \\"elite\\" troops they are to train are good at the parade ground stuff but their war fighting doctrine leaves a bit to be desired. Can you imagine firing by platoon volley while standing in straight ranks while the bad guys fire at you from concealment? It's one of those situations where the powers that be are more interested in a good appearance than in effective troops. After all, the peasants who fill the ranks are pretty cheap to replace. <br /> <br />David Sherman and Dan Cragg do a good job of capturing the military mindset and it makes for enjoyable reading. They are never going to get literary prizes but I, for one, am glad that they would rather tell a compelling story. <br />	2005-07-24

That is why I had to have this one for FIREWORKS. I have to admit to being a little disappointed but that is mostly do to the previous book setting the mark so high. This is still a great tutorial to learn the program, especially for someone like me who knows nothing about this subject. This book is designed as an intro, not an advanced course. <br /> <br />A few of the qualities that this series seem to share are clear instructions, easy to read print, illustrations and screen shots that are big enough to be useful and an approach that continues to build on what has been done before. This is especially true with the examples on the enclosed CD.  <br /> <br />What disappoints me is that this book is primarily designed from the approach of using FIREWORKS as a stand alone program. There is material that covers the integration with DREAMWEAVER but this material is neither as copious nor as clear as I would have liked.

Examples are given and these are helpful. They make the included exercises work. A little bit more difficult is applying the techniques to your own page with your own designs.

From the title, I thought I was getting another book on the mechanical aspects of putting together a web site in a professional manner. It is on putting together a website and I suppose you could say it involves some of the mechanics of doing so but these are the background mechanics of procedures, checklists, things to look for and watch out for, resource that might be of help and things like that. It does not cover the mechanics of HTML coding, setting up frames, CSS stylesheets, templates and such. Those are left to other books. <br /> <br />That being said, if you are part of the target audience, those wishing to go into the web site design business or given the responsibility of running a website for a company, this book can be a handy background tool. It explains options, industry trends and many of the things which will have to be thoughtfully considered in order to put together a decent site. Again, this book focuses on broad conceptual practices and not on specific means of achieving ends. <br /> <br />Information is provided on five main topics divided into five chapters. The chapters are called, \\"Gearing Up\\", \\"Essential Pre-design Tasks\\", \\"A Design that Works\\", Putting it all Together\\" and \\"Keeping the Site Alive\\". Additionally, there is an appendix which lists useful resources.  <br /> <br />As I said, this book was not what I was looking for but seems to be well and simply written. My one concern is that it was written in 2001 and some of the specifics may be a bit dated. Still, I would think that the broad concepts covered are valid. <br />	2005-07-22

This book does both.  <br />  <br />The title describes the work completely. It is a collection of quotes. It is organized in order of the last name of the person to whom the quote is attributed. When all is said and done, that is not a very helpful scheme unless you already know the quote and already know the author but I cannot think of another scheme that would prove useful. When looking for something, you just wade in, browse and hope to hit paydirt. <br />  <br />The price of this work actually aids in its usability. It is by no means a comprehensive work but does have plenty of material. That means that it is fairly easy to browse through. I much more thorough treatment would be greatly lengthened and would drive up the price. This is a useful work. <br />	2005-07-21

The primary character of the first book makes his only appearance, at his execution, in the first chapter of this one. From that point, the story is told from the viewpoint of the burned heretic's son, an Aztec prince from an area not subjugated by the Spanish. When he learns of his true identity, the prince (Called Juan Britanico because his Aztec name is too difficult to spell) vows to wipe the Spaniards from the American continent.<br /><br />Most of the book is concerned with Juan's adventures in preparation for leading his revolution. The actual revolution, in terms of battles and such, is left to the very end. As such this is more the story of a man's life instead of a war chronicle. We learn the joy and concerns of Juan and his people. Along the way, we also learn something of the native cultures of the Americas in the generation that lived through the conquistadors.<br /><br />This is an entertaining book, if somewhat graphic in terms of sex, cruelty and violence.	2005-07-20

It is one of the finest training tools to learn a software application I have found. It only barely touches on the \\"expert\\" stuff but the basic introduction is well thought out, thorough and easy to follow. The book is also unique in two respects: <br /> <br />The screen illustrations are actually big enough to read and understand. This is not always the case. There seems to be a general rule that publishers add more screen shots and fit them in by making them either painfully or impossibly small. That is not the case here. The shots are plentiful enough but also large enough. <br /> <br />The directions in the book corresponded EXACTLY to what was happening on my screen and to the examples on the included disk. Few things have been more frustrating for me in the past than to try to work through an example and then find that what happened on my system started to deviate more and more from what was described. For the first time ever, that never happened <br /> <br />Much of the information was very basic. That is what I needed. Someone who is merely looking to upgrade from a previous version of Dreamweaver will probably be disappointed and find the book practically useless. Beginners, though, should find this as much a joy to work with as any tutorial can possibly be. <br /> <br />Another thing to consider is that other books may be more useful as shelf references. This one will stay on my shelf but the nature of it is to teach through the tutorials and add extra information in those chapters. This is fine for learning the concepts but I will look for another as a reference. <br /> <br />	2005-07-18

For those who know nothing about Dreamweaver at all, a better initial learning source is needed. <br /> <br />The text spends a great deal of time going over redundant items that it would seem anyone with a modicum of Windows experience would know already; this is mainly a matter of navigating the basic Windows interface. This is not a bad thing, in and of itself, for those with limited experience but it gets infuriating when something a little more advance, actually using Dreamweaver, is attempted. At that point, readers must make leaps of faith and, all too often, the general descriptions given have only a passing resemblance with what appears on the screen. I get the impression that the book was written for an earlier product and that the updating process was not complete. <br /> <br />The matter of the screen shots is another problem area. The book is full of them. Unfortunately, many of them are so small that discerning any details is often problematical. That is bad enough with my 41 year old eyes but my nephew's 16 year old eyes did not fare much better. <br /> <br />The explanations as to the process of setting up a site are the most infuriating at all. The author admits that this is where most people have the most trouble. That is a clear signal to pay attention. The job is then bungled. Looking in other books made it clear. <br /> <br />The book is not without its strengths. Later on, when things like dealing with frames, images, styles and such are presented, the explanations are for the most part clear and intelligible. The screen shots are still too small to be useful but the text generally made the reading worthwhile.  <br /> <br />If you already know the very basics, this book might help. I think it would be better to look for another one though. <br />	2005-07-16

It does an excellent job of explaining concepts and giving an overview of the Premier Pro software. After that, it falls short. The examples are very general and no disk is provided for tutorials. This lack of examples and of real tutorials makes learning the software, at least for me, more difficult. There were time when I thought I was following along correctly only to later learn that was not the case. If I had real examples to which I could compare my work, I would have gotten a lot further. <br /> <br />Still, for teaching the basics, this is a respectable book. This is especially true if you want to learn about the program and not necessarily how to use the program. It can be read and understood away from the computer. In that respect, it is superior to example driven texts which need the presence of the PC. Still, I learn better with the examples. <br />	2005-07-13

This is true of both laity and clergy. This little volume goes a long way towards addressing that lack of understanding. <br /> <br />It is written by a Roman Catholic for Roman Catholics with Roman deacons in mind. On this subject and for this audience it is a superb book on the subject. Even so, it has some information that may be of use to Episcopal and United Methodist people as well. Some of the theology presented is distinctly Roman. Other, such as the theology of service and the ministry of all the baptized has wider use.  <br /> <br />The book is presented in a question and answer format. Typical questions about the diaconate are posed. The author then answers them in a logical and complete manner. The book is divided into eight general categories. A look at the category headings should give any reader an idea where to look to see if a particular question is examined. For example, one of the sections is on the liturgical ministry of the diaconate; readers would therefore know to look in that section to see about deacons presiding over baptism. <br /> <br />This is a great explanatory book and is easy to understand. <br />	2005-07-13

Unfortunately, I did have the need to learn it. I took a new approach for me. I ordered this book, gave it to my nephew to learn (I paid for his time) and told him to learn the program forward and backward. He was then to give me an \\"executive summary\\" type of instruction and I would rely on him to do anything beyond the basics. The approach worked, after a fashion but I could have chosen a better text. He learned the basics of the program well. The advanced capabilities were not thoroughly addressed. <br /> <br />In his words: found the \\"How to Do Everything with Adobe Acrobat 6.0\\" instructional book to be helpful to an extent. It did a good job instilling the basics but once you reach a certain point you begin to lose understanding for lack of actual interaction with the program. Many instructional guides come with an exercise disc that allows you to participate in different exercises and projects that better your understanding of the program. This particular guide does not, and as a result it is harder to understand certain topics. It has good examples and good illustrations but the lack of hands on experience is crucial. <br /> <br />In short, I am satisfied, barely. <br />	2005-07-12

I first encountered him through \\"HAMMER\\"S SLAMMERS\\" many years ago. I thought the book to be fair but it was nothing that really excited me. In the years since, I have never deliberately bought another Drake book until this one. I did occasionally read other works by him, though. Sometimes these were collaborations or parts of anthologies. I liked those much better than my original exposure so I decided to try him again. I do like this one better but I don't care for it as well as the collaborations or the shorts. Still, it is a worthy read in its own right. <br /> <br />The story is of a young lieutenant of the Cinnabar Navy given command of a small corvette. He got the command as a reward for gallantry and now must live up to expectations. He is sent off to another sector to support a commodore who does not like him with a politically sensitive passenger on board who promises to mess up the political situation on arrival. In his favor, he has a well trained crew including a friend who is an electronics wizard, a good reputation, the reputation of his navy and the chutzpah to handle them all with lots of initiative. <br /> <br />The universe created by Drake has a political structure reminiscent of the Roman Republic and has a class system that share elements of Rome with that of Imperial Britain. These can provide interest in their own right but the real interest is generated by the daring do of Lt. Leary. <br /> <br />This is a nice choice for space opera fans. <br />	2005-07-12

This book is thankful evidence that he not only has the time and energy but the artistry to do it as well. While being off of the mainstream in terms of the war between Manticore and Haven, it does flesh out some of the story quite well. The formerly shadowy Erewhon comes to the fore in this novel as does the Solarian League to a much greater extent than ever before. These little details add to the saga Weber is creating and that would be justification enough for this book but the real triumph is that it is a good story. <br /> <br />Erewhon has strained relations with its ally, Manticore due to the inept and stupid policies of Baron High Ridge. This much we have gathered from previous books. In this one, a princess of Manticore is sent in an unofficial capacity to a funeral on Erewhon. As a companion, she has Berry Zilwicki and her notorious super spy father, Anton. While on Erewhon, they run afoul of a plot by a bunch of Masadan (holy warrior) terrorists and Mesan (slaver) business interests. Victor Cachat, super agent from Haven, manages to foil the plot, assist Manticore (whom his nation is at war with), fall in love, build an important new alliance for his own nation of Haven, give a black eye to the slavers, and set up a new kingdom of former slaves that has the support of everyone but the slavers. <br /> <br />If that brief synopsis makes no sense to you, you need to go back and read the other books in the series first. If it does make sense, you probably can't wait to get started on this one too. Go for it. It's worth it. <br />	2005-07-07

Frank Baum left a bit much to be desired. Her early works seemed to involve a lot of aimless wandering with little point to it. Thankfully, her skills did improve with experience. They also seemed to improve when she dealt primarily with characters of her own creation as opposed to those created by Baum. This particular story shows her as more comfortable in her skills and more comfortable working with Oz originals. <br /> <br />This story is about a despotic ruler of a no account country outside of Oz, though still on the magical continent. He manages to obtain possession of a magical emerald necklace that grants wishes. His first with is for a magnificent horse and that one is granted purely by accident. He is naturally delighted but also disappointed that he does not know how to use the necklace. As I said, he lucked out the first time. It is the horse who figures out the secret and they come up with a plan to dispose of the various rulers of Oz, including Ozma, and everyone who could pose a danger to him. He causes everyone in Oz to forget about Ozma and the other notables. He then installs himself as emperor of Oz and it is up to Dorothy to save the day. <br /> <br />This story actually flows very well. The only problem is that the story itself is only of middling interest. Thompson handles Dorothy very well but most of the rest of the primary characters in this story are the ones she created. Dorothy is the exception. Still, she does a good job. <br />	2005-07-05

From there on out, the story is given over mostly to new characters. It does not suffer for that. <br /> <br />Although this is a volume of space faring naval adventure, it reads much less like that than as a political thriller. There are a few space battles, well thought out and well written (to be expected from Weber) but most of the book deals with the political intrigues that take place in the Talbot Cluster after they request annexation by Manticore. Although a plebiscite overwhelmingly approved annexation, most of the systems and people did so for differing reasons. There are also a few people who are violently disposed against annexation. These run the gamut from home grown terrorists to a slightly more respectable freedom fighter to other political entities with a vested interest in seeing this backwater remain a backwater. It turns out that it is the foreign influence which is most dangerous and it is the crew of the Hexapuma which is sent to bring order from chaos. They do so with flair, gallantry and bitter losses. <br /> <br />This book is billed as the first in a new HH series but I must have missed something along the way. I had some knowledge of many of the characters but there were some gaping holes in my knowledge of the back story. I can only assume that I should have read CROWN OF SLAVES (the only one I have yet to read) first and I plan to do just that immediately. This did not hamper my enjoyment of this book but I suspect I would have enjoyed it more had it been read first. <br /> <br />This is another winner. <br />	2005-07-04

Each of the stories is a solid work that makes the price of the collection worthwhile on its own. Some are serious and some are wickedly funny.  <br /> <br />Promised Land - This first story is by Jane Lindskold and would be worthy as a short story on its own merits even if the rest of the HH series had never been written. It tells the story of a young woman kidnapped from Grayson as a child by a Masadan privateer. That privateer takes her for a wife/slave. She has one secret weapon working in her favor. She can read. She joins with some other women to escape the horrors of Masada by stealing her husband's ship. Prince Michael from Manticore plays a supporting role in the story evocative of the biblical Exodus. <br /> <br />With One Stone - The second story is the work of Timothy Zahn. It describes an early incident in Honor Harrington's career, taking place right after the events of ON BASILISK STATION. The central character is actually Rafe Cardones but Honor is present through and through. It seems that someone has come up with the impossible: a way to take down the impeller wedge of a ship from an absurd distance. A disinformation scheme is trying to lay the blame at the feet of the Andermani Empire for the resulting loss of merchant shipping. It turns out, though, that the system has a few fatal flaws and that the real enemy is much more traditional. This too is an excellent story and could stand well on its own. <br /> <br />A Ship Named Francis - This one is an exceedingly short collaboration between John Ringo and Victor Mitchell. It is likely to raise the eyebrows of anyone who has ever been caught working with those who are less than competent. Being crazy helps as well. It is a story of the Grayson Space Navy. When an organization has a person who is a dedicated screwup, the two most common options are to file all the paperwork and go through channels to get rid of that person or to put that person with others of similar ability in a single place where they may more easily be kept under watch. Of course, everyone hates paperwork and since Grayson has so vastly expanded its fleet, they have more than their share of idiots to stash. The get stashed on the Francis along with a poor Mantie who volunteered because it looked like a way to fast promotion. This piece is hilarious and provides a bit of comic relief. <br /> <br />Let's Go to Prague - What happens when two extremely capable cloak and dagger types get bored on a backwater planet with nothing to do? They go one leave. They just go about it a bit differently than most people would. Instead of heading for some nice resort in the home country, they decide to take their vacation on Prague, an enemy held planet. They heard that the beer was really good there. The vacation starts off well enough until one of them runs into an old flame. Shortly after that, they get caught up in the botched defection of a Peep admiral and have to get their own butts and that of the Admiral's back to friendly space. Its an incredibly funny romp. John Ringo shows off his wicked sense of humor by himself in this one. <br /> <br />The Fanatic - Eric Flint penned this one. It is something of a sequel to a short published in the previous collection. In the final days of the People's Republic of Haven, a bright young fanatic is sent out to shake things up for state security. This is the same young true believer who helped to quash the kidnapping of a Manticorian's daughter in the last book. In that story, his eyes were opened to the real abuses of his government. Even so, he has impressed the higher ups and they give him a new job. He does it faithfully because he is a fanatic. He is a fanatic for truth, justice and his oath to the republic. He has to maintain his reputation as a fanatic to do his job and everyone is surprised by what he really considers his job to be. <br /> <br />The Service of the Sword - This final story is from Weber himself. It tells the story of the midshipman cruise of the first Grayson woman to come through the academy. During a period of downsizing and high level contempt for all things from Grayson, she finds herself assigned to a cruiser going out in search of a missing allied cruiser. Her ship is commanded by a member of the aristocracy that has been so hostile to Grayson. She is beset on all sides and fails to realize that she has some unlikely allies. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-28

He is the author of three out of the four stories of the volume. Again, this is filler material that serves as window dressing for the main series of novels but it is no less entertaining for that. In fact, I think this is the best of the 3 collections thus far.<br /><br />Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington - This is a piece by Weber. It tells the tale of Harrington's first tour of duty in space and clearly shows foreshadowing of the character she is to become. She is confident, capable and does not suffer fools lightly. In this story, her ship is deployed to Silesia to suppress pirates. The pirates turn out to be more powerful than bargained for and it is the young midshipwoman who saves the day.<br /><br />Changer of Worlds - This is another work from Weber. It is a short story which details the treecat's decision to colonize other worlds with the help of their humans. The central characters are Nimitz and his mate, Samantha with Honor Harrington putting in a cameo.<br /><br />From the Highlands - This story is from Eric Flint and takes place in the capital of the Solarian Confederation: Chicago. It seems that 2 thousand years have done nothing to mitigate the existence of an underworld. The story concerns a plot by a rogue Peep SS agent to kidnap the daughter of a Manticorian intelligence agent as part of a plot to cover up his own shady dealings. What he does not count on is the resourcefulness of the young girl, the tenacity of her father and the presence of another Peep who is so morally outraged that he takes a hand in the situation. This is a good adventure story.<br /><br />Nightfall - Another story by Weber, this one seemed at first to be a plagiarism of part of one of his later HH novels. It tells the story of the battle of wills between Peep Adm. Esther McQueen and the Rob S. Pierre government. As it turns out, some of the verbiage is lifted directly from the other book but there is a wealth of additional story as well. It chronicles the events of McQueen's coup in much more detail than the novel.<br /><br />These are all solid stories and well worth the time.	2005-06-24

The idea that a modern nuclear aircraft carrier (c. 1980) could go back to 7 Dec. 1941 and solve a few problems was an intriguing one. They got part of the job done but got sucked back to the future before they could really get down to business. WEAPONS OF CHOICE does not face that problem. <br /> <br />It is set in 2021. A multinational force is off Indonesia to deal with the continuing war against terrorism. When an experiment goes wrong, the entire task force gets sent back to 1942, just before the battle of Midway. The weakest unit in the modern arsenal could single handedly win the war. If only it was that easy! <br /> <br />Since the moderns appeared mostly in the midst of Admiral Spruance's fleet and there is a Japanese ship in the task force, chaos ensues. The 1942 pacific fleet takes a beating. As a result, even when things are sorted out, there is plenty of distrust to go around. Having Germans, Russians, Japanese as part of the modern force just exacerbates the situation and having black, Orientals and women in senior command positions just makes things worse. The Allies of 1942 may have been the good guys but they had some definite problems with bigotry. Just to complicate matters further, not all of the modern forces showed up at the same place. Some wound up in the hands of Admiral Yamamoto and the Imperial Japanese Navy. <br /> <br />This book is well written, interesting and exciting. I found the principle characters to be less 1 dimensional than some other viewers. Some are presented in a simple but bigoted matter but then I am sure we have all met people like that. <br /> <br />This is to be the first book of a trilogy. I eagerly look forward to seeing what happens next. <br />	2005-06-20

As such, it will be of interest primarily to people of that communion. That does not stop it from having a wider appeal. <br /> <br />What this book does so well and so simply is explain the role of the diaconate in the various liturgies of the church. It tells what to do and when to do it providing an expansion to the rubrics of the BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER. It does not delve very much into history but does bring history up to justify certain acts. It explains the diaconal functions from an ancient and ecumenical context and then makes some provision for modern practice and usage. At all stages, the relevant passages from the BCP and other US and Canadian resources are referenced. It is a great guide for Anglican deacons but it has more potential as well. <br /> <br />Without explicitly saying so, the book describes many functions that have wider acceptance than just the Anglican Communion. Usually, these are evident by the lack of specific citations but they should be readily apparent to anyone with a passing knowledge of liturgy. This helps to differentiate denominational practice from wider practice and this book is simple enough, short enough and well written enough to be of use to others. This is especially true for United Methodists. <br /> <br />The United Methodist Church revived the permanent diaconate in 1996. Since the most recent BOOK OF WORSHIP was published in 92, it has no knowledge of deacons in liturgical functions. They are left to founder or make things up as they go along. The institutional United Methodist Church needs to address this problem but this book would be an excellent stopgap measure for UM deacons. This is especially true since UM liturgy is inherited from the Church of England. <br /> <br />A Must for Deacons! <br />	2005-06-20

I had no interest in actually reading one, though. This one was given to me as a gift by a friend. I almost had to read it. I am so glad I did.  <br /> <br />There is not much story. The book describes the exploits of Fr. Tim, an Episcopal rector in a rural southern town. Fr. Tim is getting up in years but he faithfully stumbles along from crisis to crisis in his parish life, solving each problem with a mixture of common sense, prayer and concern for those involved. The results are good for everyone except the good father. He fails to take care of himself until he is forced to do so. <br /> <br />When I am not reading academic works or preparing for a sermon, I like exciting things. This includes military fiction, science fiction and real history. I have too little time to \\"waste\\" on things that do not seem as if the will be of use either pastorally or because of personal interest. I did not think this book would hold my interest. I was wrong. <br /> <br />Karon describes the vagaries of small town life and of clerical life but does so in a refreshing way that is peaceful and restful. This is true even when issues such as a heart transplant, drug dealers, jewel thievery and dog-nappers are concerned. Reading this book did not accomplish a great deal for me except that it did do this: it gave me a pleasant rest. It amused and refreshed. It was pastorally needed in my life. I only hope I serve my congregation as well as Fr. Tim serves his. I look forward to the subsequent books. <br />	2005-06-18

It does no go over much into a description of the conduct of the rites themselves but instead describes their context, what prompted various practices and how those practices changed over time. <br /> <br />After a brief introduction, the author breaks his narrative into several distinct phases. These include Apostolic times, the period before Christianity was tolerated, the period when Christianity became \\"Official\\", and the later medieval period. Some information is given on the Vatican II reforms but this is not a major part of the book. Likewise, some attention is given to Eastern Orthodox practice early on but this subsides with the historical schism of the church and Easter rites are mentioned only in passing later on. <br /> <br />Very little will be found in here on Protestant practices but that does not stop the book from being useful to Protestants with an interest in liturgy. In the first place, it is well written and in the second, most of what is examined comes from a common heritage before the Reformation. There will even be found a few snippets that would seem to favor some modern Protestant practice over current Roman practice though they are not presented in this manner. (Unction comes immediately to mind.) <br /> <br />This volume does not presuppose a high level of training. Any person who has a basic familiarity with the practices of Christian worship should be able to follow along. <br />	2005-06-14

She also doesn't make any bones about her antipathy of political liberals in general and liberal politicians in particular. She attacks them with a vengeance. <br /> <br />Coulter's mode of attack is to use quotes and published documents to make her points. She considers a \\"liberal position\\" using quotes and documents from \\"liberal sources\\". She then looks at information, quotes, published materials and anything else she can get, often from the same \\"liberal sources\\" and then proceeds to demonstrate inconcsitancies and outright falsehoods. Usually, her diatribes are dripping in sarcasm and contempt. It can be quite entertaining but it can also wear on occasions.  <br /> <br />She is not likely to convert people who are in the opposite political camp. She is not really trying to do so. What she is doing is making life uncomfortable for them. What she does well for those on her side is articulate the arguments. <br />	2005-06-14

In this one, Honor Harrington does not appear at all but that doesn't stop it from being a good read. It consists of 3 short fiction stories and 1 \\"background\\" essay. <br /> <br />\\"A Beautiful Friendship\\" is by Weber. It details the story of Stephanie Harrington, Honor's ancestor, and her place as the first human to be adopted by a treecat. It is a good adventure story of an intelligent but headstrong young girl on a frontier planet. The genes that will eventually be passed on to Honor are present and visible. <br /> <br />\\"A Grand Tour\\" is the work of David Drake. It tells the story of an aristocratic scholar form Manticore who learns of an act of piracy by a Havenite ship. Since he has a reserve naval commission, he takes matters into his own hands using, of all things, a light cruiser won in a poker came. It comes across much more believably than it sounds. <br /> <br />\\"A Whiff of Grapeshot\\" is from S. M. Stirling. It takes place entirely on Haven and tells the story of the suppression of the Leveler revolt alluded to in some of the Honor Harrington stories. <br /> <br />\\"The Universe of Honor Harrington\\" is the background essay from Weber. In it, he details humanities march to the stars, describes the technology that makes it possible and looks at the political systems of Manticore and some of the other polities encountered in his series. It is well worth the read for fans. <br /> <br />This is an excellent little volume. <br />	2005-06-11

It seems just an excuse to show off some novel idea for a new community of Oz inhabitants. This, by itself, is not a bad thing but is seldom does as much to advance the story as one would wish. This volume is completely different.<br /><br />Speedy, the boy from America and one of Thompson's own characters, finds himself on Umbrella Island in the company of a reanimated, fossilized dinosaur. He pretty much stays on the island for most of this story. It is the island that does the wandering since it floats in the sky. The problem is that the island had recently run into a grumpy giant who expects to get the royal princess as a slave by way of compensatory damages. The story is of how this terrible fate is avoided.<br /><br />As is usual, Thompson does best when her own creations are at the forefront and her predecessor's are just backdrop. This is a good story which should appeal to all children, even 41 year old ones like me.<br /><br />Also, it looks like wedding bells may be in Speedy's future.	2005-06-06

It is not crafted as tightly as some others, Weber's Honorverse comes to mind, but it is a good read that will provide several hours of enjoyable entertainment. <br /> <br />The story concerns a group of marines. These are not US Marines but are their ideological descendants. In the first part of the book, we a treated to the life of a recruit from his initial enlistment through boot camp. He is then assigned to an infantry unit which gets deployed to a backwater planet on a peacekeeping mission. Through the medium of best wishes, the high brass decide that a peacekeeping mission does not rate a full complement of combat equipment so the unit is somewhat at a disadvantage when it hits the fan. Under the tutelage of the more experienced men around him, the young marine gets his first taste of combat. <br /> <br />This is what Melville called a \\"potboiler\\". It may not stick in long term memory as a great work of literature but it was well worth the effort. I look forward to reading the next installment in the series to see what happens. <br />	2005-06-05

Instead of directly being part of the Honor series, it is an anthology of shorts set in Honor's universe. Two of the stories are by David Weber himself and other three are from guest contributors. Honor does make a brief appearance in one of the Weber stories but it is just in a supporting role. <br /> <br />\\"The Stray\\" tells the story of a rural doctor on Sphinx not long after the first treecat adoption. He is an adoptee. Much of the story is told from the point of view of the cats. They are aware of a terrible crime by a human and manage to get the good doctor to investigate it. This is a very good story and well worth the read. <br /> <br />\\"What Price Dreams\\" is one of the Weber stories. It tells of the first time a member of the Manticorian royal family is adopted by a cat. This fortuitous occurrence helps to foil an assassination plot and results in political advantage for the cats. Much of this one is also told from the cats' points of view. It too is a good story. <br /> <br />\\"Queen's Gambit\\" takes place during the beginning of Elizabeth's reign and this brings us into the actual time period of Honor Harrington. The story concerns the assassination of Elizabeth's father and the investigation of the crime. This is an occurrence alluded to in one of the main Honor Harrington books. Again, the story is worthwhile. <br /> <br />\\"The Hard Way Home\\", Weber's second contribution to this collection, is the one where Honor makes a personal appearance. She is just a Lt. Cmdr. at the time and is serving as the XO of a ship testing out a new type of pinnace. During the trials, her people are called upon to rescue the survivors of an avalanche at a ski resort. The real protagonists in this one are the kids who aid in their own rescue with Nimitz's help. It too was a good read. <br /> <br />\\"Deck Load Strike\\" deals with a campaign by proxy between clients of the Peeps and of Manticore on a backwater planet. It is almostexclusively a military account of a raid. It was well written but I did no enjoy it as much as the others. <br /> <br />If it seems that this collection is top heavy with treecats, that is because it is. They are even alluded to in the last story though they do not take part. People fascinated with treecats will want this collection only for that reason but the stories hang together well whether you are a treecat fan or not. <br />	2005-06-05

It would be of little or no use to a recording engineer of someone who already knows a lot about recording but that is not the target audience of this little tome. The target is people who want to learn more about microphones but who know little or nothing to begin with. <br /> <br />The book starts off with a little bit of basic information on sound and then turns to a discussion of different types of microphones. The pros and cons of each type are briefly reviewed. This is in terms of directionality and in terms of type of recording elements. From there, the book moves on to discussion of how best to mic different situations like vocals, strings, piano and drums. My one complaint is that there is nothing on wind instruments. <br /> <br />One peculiarity of this book is a result of it coming from Britain. That means that some terms may not be familiar to American readers. Condenser replaces capacitor and valve replaces tube. This should not cause any problem but it may throw some people at first. <br /> <br />For many people, this may well be the only book ever to be needed on the subject of microphones. At the very least, it is a good introduction at an excellent price. <br />	2005-06-05

To round things off, I am a member of the Order of St. Luke the Physician. James Randi, the author of this tome is none of these things but he is a skeptic with an open mind. This book is long overdue and very well done. <br /> <br />My background before entering the ministry was in math, physics, engineering and biology. I know and understand the scientific method and what it can and cannot do. I also uderstand the limitations of theology and anecdotal reporting. James Randi does as well. He make no claims of being religious but is willing to look and consider each case put before him. I rather suspect him of being an agnostic but that does not prevent his outrage from showing at some of the tricks faith healers have been known to use. His book is a well presented expose and it is a shame that more people, including governmental agencies, broacasters and church members across the CHristian spectrum are not outraged by what is routinely done to people of faith. <br /> <br />Nowhere does Randi claim that healing by prayer is impossible, though he does admit to being skeptical about it. What bothers him is seeing flocks being fleeced unmercifully by people who claim to be God's annointed and seeing those same ministers actually hurt people and perpetrate frauds. I respectfully submit that such behavior should bother everyone. I know it bothers me, especially since it eventually hurts the faith of those most in need of healing. <br /> <br />I do believe in the power of prayer and make no apoligies for it. I believe it does work and is efficacious. I do not believe that prayer always gives the desired results. Modern medicine can cure many things, treat many more and fails in yet others. THe minds who have brought medicine thus far are too the gifts of God. I don't think that the \\"Amazing Randi\\" would object to very much of what I said here but he wants proof. That I cannot provide.<br /> <br />Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. I cannot provide that proof for matter of healing through faith do respond on demand. I have seen miracles of healing. Most often, these take the form of a drug therapy or surgical procedure. I believe these too are gifts from God. On a few, rare occasions, I have seen things that I chalk up to pure \\"miracle\\" but I am not advising anyone to dispense with medical treatment nor am I soliciting for funds. <br /> <br />Randi's book is a tirade against abuses of trust and against dishonesty. Too many bad people have tainted the whole concept of faith healing and he takes them to task. His goal is not to rehabilitate faith healing but to expose its misuse and fraud. For that we should all be thankful. <br /> <br />He covers the antics of a few famous \\"faith healers\\" in detail and provides sketches of others. In doing so, he gives away some of their tricks and publicizes contradictions, lies and plain old trickery. If more people were aware of these methods, fewer people might be hurt. <br /> <br />God bless James Randi.	2005-05-29

This one brought her up into the same exalted real as L. Frank Baum himself. I stiil prefer all of the originals but this one is worthy in its own right. <br /> <br />The story is of the Munchkin boy, Ojo. He is kidnapped by gypsies and then kidnapped again by a band of robbers. All of this is done for the sake of a bounty on his head. In typical Oz fashion, he visits some new realms with stange inhabitants, makes some new friends and learns about himself. This is a good story. <br /> <br />The quality of this work runs agains the usual trends in Thompson's Oz books. Some of her other books are good but the good ones tend to concentrate on characters she created herself. Many of the Oz standards put in cameo appearances in those stories but, until now, the old standbys have had short shrift in her better stories. The ones in which she does concentrate on the Baum inheritance tend to be more tentative and it is almost as if she is uncomfortable working with them. That is not the case in this book. <br /> <br />Ojo and Unc Nunkie are characters from Baum's PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ. They are the focus of this story and, in this case, they become Thompson's own creations. They are well developed and fun to follow. Realbad is a new character but likewise shows good development as the bandit leader. Snufferbux the bear is also an original creation and is most enjoyable as an old curmudgeon and Ojo's friend. <br /> <br />I hope that the remaider of Thompson's corpus will prove as good as this one.	2005-05-26

(Hardscrabble Books–Fiction of New England)	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	American Seafaring Saga for a Change	Lovers of naval fiction in the days of sail are ordinarily treated to the escapades and adventures of the Royal Navy. There are exceptions but that is the general rule. Britania, after all, did rule the wave. This book does things a bit differently. <br /> <br />In the first place, the protagonist is an American from New Hampshire. The Brits are the \\"bad guys\\" in this book. In the second place, the time period is that of the American Revolution instead of the Napoleonic Wars. This too has been done before but it is much less common. Thirdly, the protagonist is not a naval officer but a merchant sea captain from the China trade. The facts of the revolution lead him somewhat reluctantly into a privateering career. It all combines to offer a fresher type of sea saga. <br /> <br />The book opens as Capt. Frost is coming home after an adventure in the Caribean. From there is slips into an extremely long flashback detailing the final days of the return journey, where a merchat ship successfully captures a British man of war, at a high cost. From there, it is time for him to consider his next adventure which leads him and his crew to attempt what normally tooks armies with siege trains: the capture of Louisbourg. <br /> <br />One of Fender's strengths is his familiar use not only of naval terms but of period vocabulary and syntax as well. This lends an air of antiquity to the whole thing which might be tiring for some but interesting for others. <br /> <br />This book is not as exciting as some other naval series but it  <br />is well written and a good first attempt. At least one sequel has already been written and I look forward to reading it. <br /> <br />	2005-05-25

Instead, it is more of a prelude and a buildup to war. The complex political alliances are examined and war weary star nations are drug kicking and screaming into a new round of battle that everyone would just as soon avoid. In the end, however, the shooting begins and honor snookers the enemy...again. <br /> <br />People looking only for war fiction will probably not like this installment in that actual war fighting is pretty minimal. Fans of Weber's creative universe, however, will enjoy it. Along the way, any loathing of the way politicians seem to screw things up, both in the honorverse and in real life, will just be intensifed. <br /> <br />This was an interesting book but it was not all that exciting. If Weber's plans for the series are indeed as grandiose as has been claimed, this book is most likely very necessary for what will follow. Standing on its own merits, it is not quite filler but not quite worth all the effort...except in the grand scheme of things. <br /> <br />Read the others first then tackle this one. Hopefully, by the time you finish, the next installment will be ready.	2005-05-21

It presupposes a certain degree of knowledge of video production. You don't have to know a great amount but you better know the basics. What it does do, however, it does well. <br /> <br />Instead of explaining the various things that go into a video production studio, emphasis is placed of ideas to consider from the standpoint of designing or building a facility. Topics range from choice of cameras or microphones to types of lighting, control systems, ventilation and ease of use. For any given topic, there may be a very brief synopsis of the principles involved but do not expect to learn about the topics with any degree of thoroughness. Instead, it is more of a checklist of things to consider as you enter the design phase of a project. <br /> <br />This volume will also not make anyone qualified to do the actual design work. There is an insufficiency of depth for that. Instead, it provides a general background which can prove useful when talking to a competent design professional or as a reminder of things to consider for a do it yourself project. <br /> <br />Possibly the best audience for this book is a person or a company considering putting in video production facilities. After going through it, a much better idea of what to look for, ask for and aspire to is possible.	2005-05-21

Back then the dust jackets always made mention of other Oz books written by Thompson but they were always out of print. Now they are available again. <br /> <br />The bad news is that the best of Thompson's books (of the 12 I've read thus far) is not as good as the least of Baum's The early ones especially are fairly weak but they have tended towards improvement. This volume, THE PURPLE PRINCE OF OZ, though, is a throwback to some of her earlier works as to quality and enjoyability. <br /> <br />The story is of Prince Randy who is one a quest. He has been sent out from his kingdom to prove that he is worthy to wear the crown. His quest brings him to the kingdom of Pumperdink where he befriends Kabumpo, the Elegant Elephant of Oz. The Pumperdinkian royal family is abducted by a pretender to the royal throne and it is up to Randy and Kabumpo, with help from the Red Jinn, to secure the realse of the captives and set everything right again. It is this quest which forms the basis of the story. <br /> <br />The story relies almost exclusively on characters that Thompson created herself. In this case, most of them have had at least a passing mention in her previous books. Usually, she seems to do a better job with these but this book is an exception to the rule. Kabumpo is likeably in an ornery sort of way and so are Randy and the Red Jinn. The problem is with their journey. In typical Oz fashion, they encounter many villages with creative themes. The land of the torpedos is an example from this book. These villages, however, do little or nothing to advance the story other than to give the heroes and opportunity to get into trouble and back out again. The source of trouble is usually nothing more than their mere presence. It very much seems like filler material and that the wonderfully creative ideas are not well fleshed out. <br /> <br />Thompson does continue to demonstrate her flair for puns and other plays on words. The book is worth reading to rekindle the longing for all things Oz. It might very well appeal to very young readers and listeners as a story but I still lament the lack of any real meat to the story. I hope some of her others return to the caliber of the immediate predecessors of this book. <br /> <br />Buy this one for the Oz connection but don't hold your expectations too high.	2005-05-16

She back and it seems like everything is going to work out right for a change...but you know better than that, don't you?<br /><br />In this installment, Honor returns in triumph both to Grayson and to Manticore. She is the heroine of the day and can seemingly do no wrong. After all, it is not every hero who manages to return from the dead. Her popularity, though, has its price. It really hacks off the opposition in both her Star Kingdoms and there will be a price to pay.<br /><br />While Honor sets her houses in order, so does the navy. They are finally ready to resume the offensive and put away the Peeps for good. Everything goes even better than expected but they all forgot to make provisions for hacked off politicians who are determined to prevent the other party from looking good even if it means defeat.<br /><br />As usual, Weber does a superb job of telling a story. He manages to weave bits of history from the Napoleonic era into his plot line without making a carbon copy (albeit with spaceships). There are also alusions to the cold war which should be enough to send a chill down anyone's spine. This book is as worthy for its political and social commentary as it is for its grand space opera.<br /><br />As with most of the later Harrington books, this one should be read in succession. The information in the previous volumes may not be absolutely essential but it will sure make the story easier to follow.<br /><br />Start at the beginning and then be ready to put all else aside until the series is finished.	2005-05-14

The latest installment of his space opera series is just another example of this excellence and brings to light much more of the goings and happenings of the universe of Honor Harrington. <br /> <br />While it would be wrong to say that Honor herself is not the central character of this installment, her presence is always felt, it would also be misleading to think that this one is all about her. Instead, it follows several story lines after everyone believes her to have been executed by the enemy. The thing is, though, that she has survived and she has blood in her eye. She manages to put together a force of POWs, cause the Peeps no end of trouble and get herself and her people out of Dodge. It is a good read. <br /> <br />I will not say that this one has been my favorite in the series. Some of the others are more exciting. It is, however, one that most tugs at the heartstrings. it also fills in a lot of holes and lets a few other characters come to the fore at times. It is definitely worth reading but as the series progresses, readers would be well advised to start at the beginning. It would be easy to get lost in the later ones, especially this one, if you do not already have the background stories.	2005-05-11

It contains rubrics and services not in the Book of Common Prayer but still fairly common. It would also be highly useful for those involved in planning Anglican liturgies, whether they do so from the perspective of the ordained or not. Others will find much less use for it but it could still be useful or even interesting if that is where your interests lie. <br /> <br />Speaking as a member of the United Methodist clergy, I find it useful as a guide for planning some things which our refferences do not directly address. I also find it useful to come up with variations on things our books do address. The healing service it contains has been of particular use. We have a similar rite but are very free to adapt. This book helped in that adaptation. <br /> <br />I also like this book just for the simple fact that I am interested in liturgy. As such, the subject matter is of interest to me. <br /> <br />People from a non-liturgical background will find very little in this book to recommend it. The people who will find use for it are probably aware of it already. <br /> <br />	2005-05-09

This one was as well but, unlike many of his novels, there does not seem to be much point to it. It is a simple narrative describing the exploits of a pair of cousins in the ancient Hellenic world. There is very little sense of excitement or accomplishment. Instead, it is a mildly pleasant meandering. <br /> <br />Mendemos and Sostratos are cousins who work together in the trade in luxury goods. They come from Rhodes and sail the Mediterranean hoping to make a profit. In the course of their journey, they have a few mild adventures and run into some interesting people. That's about all that does happen. <br /> <br />The title come from a fossil skull of a dinosaur procured by one the cousins. To both of them, it seems to suggest the mythical gryphon. The more philosophical of the two boys wants to take it to Athens to see what the scholars there make of it. The more adventurous one thinks that will be a waste of time (and investment capital) but agrees merely to keep peace within the family. The skull figures in the drives of the characters but has little other significance than to help demonstrate the differing outlooks each has. <br /> <br />Menedemos is the captain of the vessel and is the more hot headed of the two. His twin motivations are profit and the seduction of other men's wives. Sostratos is the more contemplative one who is a thinker. He serves as the supercargo and is no less interested in profit but to him, this includes profit of the mind as well. <br /> <br />The bothers wander around on their trading journey. Some things go better than hoped for, some go worse. Their exploits, however, do not seem to be the point. Instead, they are just the vehicle to introduce readers to a very different culure which did significantly influence our own. For me, this was interesting; others may find it less so. <br /> <br />Turtledove is eminently qualified to write on these matters. He is a Greek scholar although I do believe his area of specialization is significantly later in history. It was Byzantine, if I remember correctly. I like his science fiction and alternate history books much more; I can hardly put those down. I have no regrets in reading this one though. <br /> <br />Don't expect a rousing adventure. If you want a slice of Hellenistic culture from shortly after Alexander the Great, this might be a good choice.	2005-05-08

Honor's luck had to run dry at some point and the Peeps had to find someone competent. These two facts collide horribly with terrible consequences for the grand Dame Honor.     Honor and some of her top people get captured in this one. That's bad enough. What makes it worse is that one of the head commissars is in the area when she is captured and has an axe she wants to grind...on Honor's neck. There is virtually nothing she can do about this situation either. That leaves it up to her loyal subordinates to get her out of this one. They do but pay a terrible price in doing so. No one is immune from damage in this one.    This book was nice in that it further developed characters on both sides of the war. Honor, while still prominent, takes more of a backseat and lets some of the other shine. We get to see courage, stupidity, sacrifice, venality and, yes, honor.    This is a fine book in the series. It is not my favorite but I still had a hard time putting it down.	2005-05-05

Frank Baum. That is still true but her later ones are a lot closer and show a steady improvement. In general, she tends to use her own character creations for the main story line and rely on Baum's for window dressing. That is still true but it is also true that the quality of writing for her own characters is better. That is the case with Peter in this volume    This is Peter's 3rd trip to the magical kingdoms. He is a young boy from Philadelphia and is a strong character with all the youthful exuberance to be expected of a young boy. In this story, he hooks up with a soft hearted pirate and a king whose subjects have rebelled. They learn that the pirate's mutinous crew and the king's erstwhile subjects have joined forces with the gnome king who is out to conquer Oz yet again. Most of the action in this book takes place outside of Oz. That was the case with some of Baum's best work and it also seems to be the case for Thompson.    The adventure story is a good one and John R. Neil's illustrations must be considered definitive for all things Oz. This one is worth the read.	2005-05-03
US	35771631	R300X91E853BAG	0765305038	845349303	Newton's Wake: A Space Opera	Books	3	3	5	N	Y	A worthy way to waste an afternoon, but not much else	Newton's Wake bills itself as space opera and I suppose it qualifies...just barely. It does pay more attention to story than to the science that makes the story possible; it encompass a grand sweep in terms of both time and distance; there is aremed conflict by competing parties; there are gand questions of existance. These seem to be some of the essential elements of the genre. There is something missing, however. For me, that missing element is excitement. <br /> <br />I could follow along with the character but never really cared what happened to them. I just followed along to see what would happen without really rooting for any side (there are several). <br /> <br />Much of the story seems disjointed. The parts work together but they do not mesh as well as they could. Also, the ending leaves much to be desired. I did not really care what happened to the characters but, having invested the time to read about them, I would have like a clearer picture of their fates and the results of their efforts. <br /> <br />That I was able to follow along was due to the author's writing skill. He comes up with interesting plays on words, and manages to satirise a nummber of mindsets and institutions near and dear to the hearts of 20th and 21st century readers. This happens, often enough, by completely warping the character or teachings of some of those institutions and making historical reality take a back seat to message. This is intentional and helps to demonstrate how historians tend to forget some of the important parts of their stories. His amalgamation of Jesus and David Koresh provide just one example of his ability to leave you scratching your head. <br /> <br />I certainly do not regret having read this book. It was a pleasant enough way to waste an afternoon. It is not, however, something that makes me want to run out and buy all his other works. I probably will at some point but I am not driven to it.	2005-05-01

I suppose I am since (before a brain tumor) I was literate in 8 and could pass in another 8 or so. It wasn't the languages that interested me so much as the writing systems. This is the book that made me realize that several years ago. <br /> <br />Most people would consider this to be a refference book. So it is but anyone intersted in the different types of scripts will enjoy reading it straight through. It enumerates and explains almost all writing systems of note including both those that are extinct and those that are extant. For each, the system by which sounds are transmitted to a graphic medium are explained. This necessitates some basic linguistics but the text provides all that is needed. <br /> <br />Scripts of historic interest are explained in the same manner and so is the method of their decipherment. This alone would make it an interesting book to me but there is so much more. <br /> <br />A person who is interested in writing and writing systems would be hard pressed to find a better book.	2005-04-29

It cannot even be considered an adequate \\"operator's manual\\". It serves a much different purpose. It helps one who knows nothing or practically nothing to get started, to learn the right questions to ask and to determine if this is really a field of interest after all. For those purposes, it is excellent. <br /> <br />In addition to some very basic general priniciples, this book also contains a lot of practical advice and entry level explanation. Why is time code important? Why should tapes be logged? What is the best way to capture the kids' birthday party and not completely bore everyone? Each of these questions, and others, is important but their importance may not seem at all obvious to a beginner. This book answers question like that so that people who will take this hobby further will get started on the right track. <br /> <br />The place I see this book as particularly valuable is for someone considering the purchase of video equipment. It will provide insight as to what is involved. Someone who has already bought some expnesive equipment might be better served by a book that is a bit more advanced.	2005-04-29

That is not the type of book this is. Instead it is like a \\"dictionary\\" to look up terms from folklore. There is an occasional, short narrative but this is the exception rather than the rule. <br /> <br />That being said, the book is informative and did teach me a bit about the various genres within Scottish folklore. This made the book worthwhile for me. So to did a few historical vignettes that helped to explain the genesis of particular traditions. <br /> <br />One problem with the format of this book, a dictionary, is that it makes it difficult for someone who does not already know all the terms. For example, if you had never heard the term \\"selkie\\" you would not know to look under this heading to find out about these creatures. My approach was not to try and solve this problem and read it from cover to cover. Some of the entries on place names were a bit dry but easily breezed over. The book is well written enough to be able to be read in this manner as a learning experience.  <br /> <br />In short, this book is not light reading but it was interesting for someone seeking to learn a bit more about this subject.	2005-04-29

Furthermore, what happens when you use your new system to take them all by surprise, ONCE, and then get demolished each time after that because everyone is now ready for the trick? Just to make matters worse, you embarass the admiral who came up with the one time gimmick. The answer is that you get sent off to a post no one wants where you will be out of sight and out of mind. That's what happens to Honor. <br /> <br />Honor's task is virtually impossible and her enemies want her to fail. She dissapoints them in that she succeeds magnificnetly. Along the way, she becomes a naval hero in the tradition of Horatio Hornblower.  <br /> <br />Weber does a great job adapting the institutions of the Royal Navy from the Napoleonic wars into space opera. This is true in terms of politics and culture as well as in strategy and tactics. In its context, it is believable and fun. <br /> <br />No one should expect a lesson in physics. That is not what this story is about. Instead, it is about, courage, leadership and, yes, Honor. It is a fun read and I am looking forward to the reset of the series.	2005-04-28

It is not, in my opinion, the best of the lot, but with such stiff competition it does compare well. It also has some of the most developed supporting characters thus far. <br /> <br />The story picks up where Honor is recalled to active duty by Manticore for a job no one else wants. Even her political enemies support her selection for the job becasue her success would be good for them financially and her failure would rid them of her troubling presence. It is a bad situation and she is saddled with a troublesome crew and an armed merchant vessel just to make things even dicier for her. As all her fans know, she IS the one for the job. <br /> <br />Space opera can sometimes be accused of having heros who are too heroic and villains who are too villainous. Often that is true but does not bother me if the story is good. This story IS good but Weber goes the extra mile here. There are some bad guys around without any redeeming qualities whatsoever. I would gladly execute such vermin and not lose any sleep over it. The main \\"enemies\\", however, in the form of the Peep navy are protrayed as real human beings with honorable intentions. One can even come to admire one of the political \\"commissars\\" as an honorable person. That takes some skill in space opera and Weber delivers. <br /> <br />Some people have apparently delved into this as their first foray into the \\"Honoverse\\" and done so successfully and enjoyed the book. Great for them! I cannot help but believe, however, that they would have gotten much more out of it had they begun at the beginning or even just the previous book. Knowing the backgrounds of the characters helps. <br /> <br />Fans of Nimitz will be glad to learn that he finally develops a love life. I hope he will be happy in the volumes to come and, perversly, I can well imagine that his love life will complicate Honor's to no end. <br /> <br />Its nice to find that your enemies can be honorable even when your \\"friends\\" are not!	2005-04-28

I like them too much. When I start one, I tend to get very little else done until it is finished. Unfortunately, this latest offering has the same property and they always seem to come at inconvenient times like during exams, or when a major project is coming due. It's worth the price. <br /> <br />This is the first book of a new series. Instead of reaching back into history, it tackles real issues now. It does so with all of the traits that have come to be expected of Griffin's books. These trait have rightfully been condemned as formulaic but, in this case, the formula works. <br /> <br />The focus of the book is the war or terrorism. This is a much more difficult war to portray than the second world war, Korea or Vietnam. Its nature is such that the role of intelligence and the lack of intelligence are even more problematic than normal. This gives an even greater opportunity for Griffin to write about the special operations types he obviously loves. It also provides an opportunity for his to take a critical and sometimes scathing look at the cultures of the communities who gather, process and disemminate that intelligence. <br /> <br />As is to be expected in a Griffin Book, the protagonist is the wealthy playboy type. This device is used so often by him that it would be laughable were it not for the fact that it works and works well.  <br /> <br />Another characteristic of his work is here in full force as well. It is certainly not politically correct. Griffin pull no punches in defference to race, national origin or religion. He calls them as he sees them and is likely to offend some people. The same people who are offended, however, miss the fact that he is also very respectful of those from other races, nations and cultures. The key to his treatment of people is how they behave and not the color of their skin of nation of origin. Are they honorable? (by Griffin's standards) <br /> <br />I hope that this is just a taste of things to come. I look forward to seeing more of Castillo and seeing the bad guys lose.	2005-04-25

When I did see it, I knew I had to have a copy for myself. It was the first book I ever read and it brought back precious memories. <br /> <br />The story is about a frivolous young tugboat that would rather play than work. This damages his own and his family's reputation. By the time he is ready to turn over a new leaf, none will take him seriously. He does get his big chance, however, and redeems himself while saving the day when nobody else can. <br /> <br />This is the book that kindled my love of reading and stoked the fires of my fascination with ships.

It is useful to both novices and those with more experience. Starting with the very basics, and that does involve some physics, it works its way through virtually all aspects of sound production for digital video. <br /> <br />Do not be fooled. You are not going to learn much to improve the built in recording that comes with your camera. The author is unapologetic in his broad condemantion of the built-in stuff in terms of both quality and usablility. He goes into the reasons and gives a bit of advice on making the most of what you have but this is not what the book is about. Instead, it is about exactly what the title claims. Unfortunately, this is seldom if ever achieved with the built in stuff. <br /> <br />After going over some of the basics of sound and recording, different types of equipment are described in terms of suitability to task and cost. After that, the actual use of this equipment is considered in a variety of situations. The book is not just concerned with equipment and its use, however. There are chapters on editing and even on the use of prefessional talent. In short, the assumption is that you want to get good quality audio for your video production. The author then describes how to do exactly that in a variety of settings. Unfortuately, doing the job sometimes takes a bit more effort than just pushing the record button on the camera. It also take a bit more money although it does not have to take a great deal more. It depends on what type of sound is needed and how you are going to use it. <br /> <br />If all you want is to catch the background sound in a home video, spend your money on something else. If you want to learn how to get the best possible sound for your particular need and preserve that sound to use with video, you need this book.	2005-04-23

It could not possibly be as good as the 4th. Instead, it was even better.<br /><br />All of this comes after my mediocre reception of the 3rd volume. \\"Flag in Exile\\" deftly handles the problem I perceived in the thrid book. Flag captains just don't have as much opportunity to shine as independant commanders. It should be worse for an admiral with a fleet command. Weber solves this problem quite handily in that Honor's responsibilities as an admiral are a very minor part of the story. Mostly, she spends her time defending herself and her minions from those arrayed to destroy her. The attack her and all around her with both savagery and depravity. She, on the other hand, maintains an honorable and admirable stance throughout. In the end, she destroys almost all of her enemies and then takes on the enemy fleet for good measure. Even so, there are enough political enemies and foreign enemies to ensure at least a few more great books after this one.<br /><br />Again, Weber does a great job melding the institutions of the British Royal Navy in the Napoleonic era with space opera. There is not as much technical analogy in this volume as in others. Instead, political analogies abound. Rob S. Pierre is the chairman of the Committee for Public Safety of Haven. Robespierre must be twisting in his headless grave! There are also analogies which can be drawn with other societies and times. The SS makes an appearance. There is even much that can be seen in our modern world.<br /><br />Buy this book but read the others first. This one can stand alone but stands so much better with all of the previous story in place.	2005-04-22

Frank Baum. I had all of his books and knew that others had been written after his death because they were always listed on the end leaves. Unfortunately, they were out of print. No longer.<br /><br />As a general rule, Ruth Plumly Thompson's Oz books are nowhere near as good as Baums. This volume is no exception but is her best work so far. She does a good job of evoking the magic of Oz in her books but, too often, the stories are rather simplistic and fraught with coincidence. They are enjoyable but pale in comparison to the original. This work, \\"The Yellow Knight of Oz\\", is good enough to be ranked with Baum's books.<br /><br />Thompson frequently alludes to many of Baum's characters and they often appear in her works but she has created some new characters of her own as well. Judging by how often Sir Hokes of Pokes appears, he must have been one of her favorites. In this volume he takes center stage. In fact, all of the Baum characters are just peripherals. It may be that working entirely with her own creations has improved the quality of her work. This story is certainly the best of hers so far.<br /><br />Sir Hokus goes off on a quest. He is joined by an American boy. After a number of adventures, he clears up some early history of Oz and restores 2 kingdoms. He finds a nice wife for himself along the way.<br /><br />Like all of Thompson's books, this one satisfies a need for more things Ozzian. In this case, it does so with a refreshing flair and is an ejoyable read.	2005-04-21

I gave it only 4 stars. This one is back up to five only because six is not an option. I consider it the best so far. <br /> <br />Unlike the previous book, this one is driven much more by the strong characters and motivations. It is hard to have that kind of drive with task force level confrontation (the last volume) but is is here in plenty. What could be more personal than the ugly world of politics and duelling? <br /> <br />As usual, Weber did a superb job of adapting Napoleonic era customs and naval practice to space opera. This time, however, the fighting sail of the line have not been transposed into the \\"wall of battle\\". Instead, the villainy and corruption of court politics and petty intrigue have been transposed by a thousand years and have been found to be just as sickening. The heroine does the right thing, always the right thing, and does so only because all of the institutions of her society have failed her. As a result, she continues to do the \\"right thing\\" and is pilloried for it. When she comes back, as she doubtless must do (judging by the books I have yet to read), she is going to come back with blood in her eye and I think Manticore and \\"the peeps\\" had better watch out. <br /> <br />My only regret is that the next volume in the series is sitting on a table at home and is not with me. I have to wait 4 more days to return home and begin it. It will be a slow 4 days. <br /> <br />This one is a one sitting read.	2005-04-20

I thought I might learn something about bowed strings and purchased this book. It teaches some very basic rudiments of music such as how to read it and gives some very basic information on the instrument but no one, even an accomplished musician, is going to learn much from this book. If you are already a musician, you will learn almost nothing about how to play this particular instrument. If you are not a musician, I don't think you will get enough to learn anything useful. <br /> <br />There is one redeeming feature of this book. There is a small quanity of useful information about differing types of strings, their properties and usefulness. Its about 2 paragraphs. It was however, something that might be useful. <br /> <br />Save your money and get a more comprehensive tutorial or, better yet, hire a teacher...at least for the first few lessons.	2005-04-20

The images I had seen were confusing and any explanation I had heard was decades old. This book gave me all I was looking for and a bit more. <br /> <br />The book is written by an anthropologist as an academic work but that does not mean it is not useful to the masses. A full explanation of various taurine events, known collectively as \\"bullfighting\\" in English, occurs in the first two chapters. I am confident that having read it, I could attend one of these events and have a good idea of what is going on. <br /> <br />The author makes a point I have heard before. These events are not sports in the way the English world thinks of them. Neither are they art as we are used to it. Instead, they are are unique type of event which draws on both. The author explains this better than I ever could. <br /> <br />Fully half of the book is devoted to examining these taurine events in a cultural context. A person who wanted only to learn about \\"bullfights\\" could read the first half and never have a desire to go on. That person would have admirably accomplished the objective at hand but would have missed out on a wealth of more information, cultural and societal, which was fascinating. The book would have worth the price to examine either the fights themselves or the cultural context. Getting them togetehr is icing on the cake. <br /> <br />My one critisicm of this work is that it focuses almost exclusively on these events in Spain. I think Mexico is mentioned only twice in the entire book. There is no discussion of how these events differ in Mexico and the rest of Latin America, if indeed they do. The topic is not addressed so I don't know.  <br /> <br />If you know nothing about the world of the Corrida and want to learn, this is probably your best bet.	2005-04-19

It is written by Episcopaleans for Episcopaleans and with the BCP lectionary in mind. As such, it is of very limited use to anyone who is not planning Episcopal liturgies. Even so, I have found it useful as a United Methodist pastor for some of the information it gives and the ideas it has generated. I find it particularly amusing (and sad) that the Anglican Communion observes a Feast of John and Charles Wesley (March 3rd) but my own denomination has no such observance.  <br /> <br />This can be a useful book if you have a particular need, otherwise, save your money.	2005-04-16

I like it anyway because I like old naval fiction and I like space opera. Both are being stroked with this series. <br /> <br />Weber does an admirable job of adapting the terms and tactics from the days of fighting sail to the realm of science fiction. He draws in a simliar manner for his political structures but does not restrict himself to the simple England/France confilct. Thare are shades of US/Soviet antagonism as well. <br /> <br />As for this particular book, it is an enjoyable read but it was not nearly as much fun as the first two. Some of this may be due to the fact that the heroine has been promoted to a less exciting job. Flag captains just aren't as dashing as captains with independant commands. That may be part of it but there is another quality missing as well. I just didn't have as much afinity for the supporting characters in this one. The possible exception may be the slimball, Lord Young; he was a delight to detest. <br /> <br />All in all, it kept my interest but did not leave me begging for more like the first two.	2005-04-15
