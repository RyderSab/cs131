I almost pity Johansen, since Robert's book came out at the same time. This was a waste of money. The heroine did too much whining and not enough taking care of herself. Way too passive aggressive. The hero, refused to explain himself either. I think she was channeling Kay Hooper on a bad day.	2005-10-13

Lucias was a confused and confusing hero, the heroine (I can't even remember her name) was annoying and boring. In fact this book was very confusing and not very memorable. She introduces too many characters and everyone has sex on the brain. Next time, I think I would to prefer to have a plot.	2005-10-07

The only person I wanted to learn more about was Sergii (the hero). I felt she short changed him and the heroine was way over developed. Don't waste your money on this.

The aunt and the rest of the characters in the book were interesting. I just really disliked Abby. Why did he want her, she was an annoying whiner who seemed overly concerned with herself. I couldn't understand why the Russian didn't dump her and choose a more interesting sister.  Also, the mystery (plot?) wrapped itself up most unconvincingly.

I actually was so interested in the story I skipped over the sex scenes. I was surprised that the hero couldn't figure out the connection sooner.

The only hitch was the introduction of the Dire Wolves. I really could have done with out more races/creatures to keep track of (it's getting to be like the Keynon books).

If the book had sold for 6.99 I would be giving it a higher score. The characters are funny, but you feel like you're missing something. Like drinking fuzzy water - where is the taste/flavor. Sure it was fun to drink but afterwards you're really thirsty. I liked the Boss and the best friend, they almost overshadowed the heroine. The hero (I can't even remember his name,just that he was tall, dark haired, wealthy and some sort of royalty) was underdeveloped. The heroine, came off as another whiny, white girl. After a while you start to say how difficult could your life really be: you have super powers, a great body, and you own your own business. Just shut up and go do the work. Stacy (the friend) finally shuts her up when she reminds her nothing in life is free. Stacy needs her own book (and a trip to AA).	2005-04-28

She seems like one more whiny, spoiled upper middle class white girl. So her husband died, so her father died - boo hoo. Everyone in the world must now revolve around her. Who cares. I actually ended up enjoying the secondary romance between the banker and the secretary more. She should write that book.	2005-04-26

Not enough action, except in the bedroom. I was a little disgusted with this entire series and was determined to not read her books anymore. Then I started over at the beginning, and realized that this woman can really write. Her story pulls you in and you're rooting for Merry, Doyle, Rhys, Galen, Kitto, and Frost. I actually can't decide which one I want to be King. Sure, some readers have trouble with the overt sexuality, but come on, much of the sex is behind closed doors. She really only has three sex scenes in a 300-400 page book. I really, like the books and would you suggest you buy all of them.	2005-04-21

I loved Arabella and Jack. I loved the hint of danger in Jack and Arabella's good sense. She carefully planned her actions and didn't engage in the usual historical romance virginal silliness. No wacky friends or over the top villians. The book could have used more suspense or more tension. Don't skip this one.	2005-04-15

There is really too much information that does not follow the traditional vampire legend. The sex is very good, but the relationships are too difficult to follow. The Patron had been built up to be a super bad guy, but in the end he wasn't. Colin Foxxe came off as a whiny baby and the heroine as an overly needy girl. Don't get me wrong I actually liked the book, it was just hard to get over the annoying parts.	2005-03-25

The characters are so well drawn and complex, even the secondary characters. You can tell she is setting up a series but unlike Keynon's books the secondary characters don't overwhelm the plot. It does take a while to get to the action, because she is creating an entire legend and background. The only part of the book that I disliked was the cover. (They should have gone with a tiger motif). The ending was a bit abrupt, but it was still satisfying. Buy this book!	2005-03-25

For some reason this book seems to be missing something. Maybe because I needed to know more about the hero. His short introduction just wasn't enough. I would have liked to hear more about what he was thinking, what were his motivations (besides sex witht heroine). The heroine was smart, funny and commited to rescuing her brother. She was also missing something. When I put the book down I wasn't satisfied. It was like eating a fish dinner and being hungry two hours later. The Egyptian locations were interesting, but I really wanted to hear more about the older brother.	2005-03-05

I really liked that book and was looking forward to this one. I wouldn't recommend this one (try the library or a friend or used first). It isn't bad, it just is incredibly annoying. Too many coincidences, to many people standing at just the right time to help. Also, The heroine is another whiny, annoying female. She wants freedom, but boo hoo I can't help anyone else. She just takes and takes and people cover up for her. If she wants to be free, then she needs to deal with the consquences of all her actions. True adults don't run from responsiblities. When she gets absolved of her guilt(another coincidence) she suddenly can grow up and take charge of her life. If you read this book look for Lani and Gunnar - their interaction is the only interesting part of this book.	2005-03-05

I read her previous series and liked only the first book with Jack Frost. The rest were confusing and badly written. This book falls into that category. It started off with a huge bang, and was very engrossing, it then descended into stupid drivel. By the end of the book I was hoping they were going to get killed. She doesn't spend enough time developing characters and relies on back story explanations. I felt no empathy or interest for their situation. I failed to understand why the heroine was even at his townhouse (oh wait the so convienent snowstorm). she was blocks away from her hotel, this is New York take a train!  No instead she shacks up with someone she believes might be crazy and he then does crazy things. She of course takes at first glance his explanation because her husband died and she is still in pain! The reader is in pain after fifty pages because of her stupid decisions.  The overly gory ending is not for the faint of heart and seems like it was tacked on to add suspense to a dead plot. Avoid this one. I threw this away. I was too embarrased to even pass it on to a friend.	2005-03-05

I looked up the previous two books in the series and was very disappointed. I read both while standing in Borders, and I was glad I didn't spend the money. I really liked Derek's story but I was mildly disappointed. It was a little abrupt and short. Almost as if she ran out of steam. I'm laying off off her books for a while.

Way to much detail about Renaissance Fairs and jousting, not enough romance or character development. I tried skipping pages hoping it would get better - nope! Save your money and read this at the library (or use it for kitty litter)	2005-02-26

I will say that the book becomes satisfying when you see how the Leors want to change. They are very interested in not staying a warlike race. I really liked how Jenna realized her mistake and was willing to take responibility for it. You won't be disappointed by the end. Don't mistake me -this isn't the greatest book ever written but I think it was a good introduction to Spangler's work.	2005-02-26

What it is not: Laurell Hamilton, Kenyon,Kelly Armstrong or MaryJanice Davidson at their best or worst. This book is so over rated I was forced to buy it. It is only the second book I actively disliked this year Minion by L.A. Books was also a radical disappointment. If you need your vampire fix try somewhere else.	2005-02-12

The last decent entry was Dark Symphony. I barely got through Dark Guardian and Dark Legend. This book is interesting, the sex is hot and the family dynamics intriguing. The main problem is the refusal of Colby (heroine) to admit that there is a problem and of Rafael (hero) is entirely too dominant. I love dominant men (in print), but he's almost abusive. He takes away ALL choices and then claims it's because he loves her. Real love doesn't deny choices. The entry of a new story line of vampire enemies is also incredibly annoying. Every other entry insists that vampires can't work together, now they're planning a grand conspiracy? Please! I think that this book would have been better if he had just taken the family back to the Rain Forest in the beginning.	2005-02-06

The main problem is an overdevelopement of the female heroine and an underdevelopment of the hero. Why does he care so much about her, except for the prophecy. The real characters to watch are Brenna and Brigid. Elphame needs to stop whining about her place in life. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, I just didn't understand why we should care so much about Lojain and Elphame.	2005-01-20

They are both a little clunky and not nearly as good as anything else they've written but they cover up the smell of rotting corpses coming from the Anita Blake novella.

She used the first person narrative from the males perspective and it was perfect. The heroine wasn't a weeping willow by the time he got done with her (he even sent her to therapy). It was a little disconcerting how unapologetic he was about his career choice. But a still tight, interesting read.	2004-12-19

Julian should have been the perfect hero -full of agnst and in love yet strong willed. Instead he makes several stupid decisions (I'd fire him if he was my lawyer). Penelope makes even more stupid mistakes. This series is awful. The first two books were wonderful and she should have stopped. Penelope annoys me because she had several opportunties to solve her husband problem, instead she tries running away and being the passive victim hoping somone (usually Julian will save her).

Then came this piece of cow pile. This sucks. The writing is amateur and sloppy the characters are purile and annoying. Most disgusting of all is she makes the brother from the previous book the bad guy, and the brother and his wife disapper. What happens to them? I'm not wasting $14 more to find out!

You actually felt like you were in Victorian England (well with demons). The heroine is resourceful and loving. Adrian is smart yet not over bearing. He is not a super alpha male hero, but he shows such care and love. I love the fact that he makes difficult choices and is not apologetic about them. No quirky, zany characters or last minute saves from new people. This is a tightly drawn story you will soak in. The only real problem is it ends a little abruptly. I could have gone on for another 100 pages.	2004-11-09

While it was interesting, it could have been so much better in the hands of a stronge writer. The women have been strong and the men incredibly sexy. The problem is the uneven pacing. When the romantic time comes in the book it is rushed and extremly unromantic. The endings are too abrupt and many times confusing. What starts off as a bang usually ends with a whimper. Don't get me wrong,if you need a paranormal fix this book would calm your hunger pains but it won't sate your appetite.	2004-09-23

The Characters and story could have been so much better in some other author's hands. The female lead was whining, annoying and made so many stupid choices. For example, she refused to find out what a Guardian's job is. She refused to accept the protection of being the Draco's mate. Instead she blithly walked into another Dragon's weyr and got into trouble. Jim, her demon provides comic relief and Draco is to die for. By the time I got to the end she has made so many stupid decisions I ended up throwing the book against the wall. Read this for the sex scenes, but this is definately not a keeper.	2004-09-17

The children are annoying, not cute. In fact you really wish they would conveniently disappear with a governess so you can concentrate on the main characters. The mystery takes too long to develop and then the main characters brush it off as unimportant. (Death threats and kidnappings are somehow less important than scandal) The ending is rushed and hardly explained.	2004-07-13

She spent too much time worrying over the lead characters past and not enough time developing the romance or the mystery. It was very disappointing.	2004-07-09

Each book seems like its only purpose is to set you up to buy the next one. You expect super bad heroes but they are all crying babies. The heroines are awful too. Please stop the train and try something else.	2004-06-22

She does a much better job here. The heroine isn't nearly as annoying and the villian is really bad. I think you should add this to your cart.	2004-06-22

Also, what is with this interracial thing - I'm a black woman annoyed by the this scenerio. This book was a waste of [money]- I'm writing the publisher and asking for my money back!!	2003-08-30

The couple meets has sex, sex, I never thought I would say it but the sex is awful and the story is awful. It doesn't sound exciting for them or the reader. Stick with Thea Devine and Susan Johnson and avoid this writer.	2002-04-19

I really liked the hero and heroine, but the ending was rushed and overly complicated.  I think Thea Devine lost focus towards the end but the rest is good enougth to make up for it.	2002-04-08

Robb) the rest are excerpts of up coming books (some not coming out until October)!  Why would I spend 8$ for the first chapter of a book and then wait 2 more months to get the rest.  If your that eager go ahead, the J. D. Robb may be worth it alone.  But you were warned	2001-08-10

I could hardly belive this was written by the same person who wrote the Born In trilogy.  Nora what happened.  None of the main characters in these 3 books were sympathetic.  Between whining and complaining and dumping on  the men these women deserved to stay single.  Please Nora don't write books  like these anymore.	2000-06-23
