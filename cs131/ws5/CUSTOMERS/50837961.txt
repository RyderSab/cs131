It took me a while to pick it up to read because this type of story doesn't usually appeal to me. Boy, was I surprised.

This one didn't fail me. Miller takes on a reflective character who looks back on her past, as well as lives in her current life and challenges. It's a joy to read about a woman attempting to make healthy choices for her life. <br />There's a description of an underwater town in this book that haunted not only the pages, but also my mind. Miller has a unique way of making &quot;the world below&quot; an integral, yet tiny part of the overall story.	2002-10-17

Like many family courtroom dramas, the end was twisted, but came out like you thought it would. Just when you think nothing more could happen to this family, the barn burns down. I know barn burning was a reality, but again? <br />Overall, I was entertained, but found the saga of the Cardinal family a bit predictable.	2002-10-02

It is the satisfaction of reading a book about a woman in science that most attracts me. <br />Annabel, the main character, is a woman of honor in the scientific field. Gross gives Annabel great field skills, courage, energy and dedication. I thoroughly enjoyed enduring the Australian forests, feeling the mistaken hand on a snake, smelling the bat guano... <br />Gross gives credibility to women in science, yet does not make them single-minded creatures of study. Annabel deals with the death of a family member that haunts her studies, attractions to others, and even some romance, yet she maintains herself as a reliable and steadfast scientist, too. <br />Brava!	2001-12-29

I am a huge fan of Barbara Kingsolver, but this book was the one that delighted me most. <br />I work with moths and some of the other critters Kingsolver mentions in this book. I have little tolerance for authors that do not do their research when writing about wildlife. Kingsolver not only accomplishes this, but also makes it easy for all readers. Aside from the creative, fiction value of this book, you are going to get a factual, learning experience. <br />Now, the characters - Ah, the characters! You'll meet some individual people that have an extreme appreciation for nature and the world around them. Their viewpoints differ dramatically, but they all appreciate the outdoor world. You'll meet a young widow, and older woman with a sad past and a woman who lives in the mountains to escape. They are all superbly developed characters, alive and likeable. <br />I can assure you, if you like Kingsolver, or if you are a fan of nature, you will love this book.	2001-03-03

This book has such vivid characters and scenes in it. I am haunted by the book and the possibilities it brings to mind. Even after reading it over 7 years ago, I still remember the characters and circumstances they experienced as if I read it yesterday.	2000-12-02

Jan Brett's writing and illustrations are absolutely top notch. The pictures foreshadow events happening on the next page, and keep children's interest. My daughter loves looking at the smaller illustrations on the side of the pages to see &quot;who's coming to the mitten next!&quot; This book is a keeper and Jan Brett is one classy author!	2000-11-17

Mr. Paterniti tells a hillarious story of driving across the United States with the man who did the autopsy on Albert Einstein, and KEPT HIS BRAIN! The author has a wonderful sense of humor which is a good thing, because he seems to attract strange people to him along the trip. He'll suddenly blurt out &quot;I have Einstein's brain in the trunk&quot; to almost any stranger along the trip. The responses that ensue are terrific! I giggled and laughed heartily while reading this book. It's a super way to spend some free time!	2000-11-09

I love this wreath book! The instructions are well written and easy to understand, but the photos - ah - the photos! The photos elegantly, yet simplistically illustrate each and every wreath in the book. The book also adds in variations you could do to some of the wreaths. It's a keeper!	2000-10-24

If you love great kids books, and love to learn, this is a great book for you! How Are Butteflies Like Chickens, by Betty Ann Knudsen, is not only a beautifully illustrated book, it also uses a &quot;joke format&quot; to teach. Did you know that butterfly caterpillars have something in common with snakes? Did you know butterflies and moths are like fish in some ways? I'm not going to give away the reasons they are similar, but the book will tell you! I highly recommend it!	2000-09-28

I am not much of a non-fiction reader, but this book, recommended by my  bookclub, is a page-turner. I'm not saying every page was easy to turn,  though. Some of the interviews and stories hit so close to home for me,  they made me weep. Others brought back memories of friends, abandoned  relationships and lost ideals of my youth. I can't help but identify with  most of the women in the book. If nothing else, I felt some relief in my  soul to know that there are others with the same life-choice struggles I  have.	2000-09-17

We use it  at our nature center on a daily basis. Not only does it have excellent  illustrations, but it also lists the various host plants of each  caterpillar. Next time a child brings you a caterpillar you can ID it and  tell the child what it will need to eat to become a moth or butterfly. We  couldn't live without it!	2000-08-19

Put it in your backpack, pocket, glove box or camper and  always be ready to identify! The illustrations are excellent and provide  enough detail to know one similar frog from another. If you're looking for  some biological detail, go for a bigger book, but this one is great for  quick ID.	2000-08-19

To the best of my knowledge, the information about monarchs is accurate and credits respected sources. All the chapters have information that makes you more and more aware of the  wonders of the natural world. The chapter on monarchs covers their  migration, their toxicity, their eating and mating habits and more. The  information is backed up by research data collected in the last 40+ years.  I recommend it!	2000-03-29
