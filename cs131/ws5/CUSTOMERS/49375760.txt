It istargeted more towards teens, but some adults might like it. This bookhas everything, action, emotion, romance (well kinda, if you know what I mean).  Gaia, the name of the main girl in the story, is like superwomen. She knows like almost every form of karate, which her father tought her when she was a child. But the thing about Gaia is she is fearless. She has no fear to her at all. Which is a good thing since this girl gets into a lot of trouble. This is a great book for almost any teen, if you like romance novels, action, or dramas. I highly recomend this book.	2000-06-12

It was a book that kept you thinking about what would you do if you were in his/her shoes. The characters in the book were constructed very  well. Paul was the main character, he was a courious, suspicious person who  was the only person that could see right through Erik(his brother who  sprayed spray-paint in his eyes and made him have terrible vision) and  could see the bad about him. The only thing that could of been better about  the book was its ending. It didn't answer all of the questions the reader  wanted to know. Besides that the book was good and I recomend it to all  teens. Even adults will enjoy it.	2000-06-12

Paul has big glasses and a brother that needed to stop getting into trouble before it was too late for him and he got a little out of control just like what happened in the story. Paul is a kid  that i wouldnt want to hang around with becuase he has big glasses and  finds his computer his best friend. Thats pretty sad and his brother is  popular so i can understand why erik doesnt want to hang out with him. At  the end of the story Paul gets Erik back for the bad things that happened  to him that were his fault, which i found the best part of the story plus  Paul doesnt have the best of luck either in the end of the story though.  Good book overall and I hope other people like it too!	2000-06-12
