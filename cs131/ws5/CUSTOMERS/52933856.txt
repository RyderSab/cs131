The book starts with our young criminal in a boarding school, where he he outclasses his fellow students and teachers. On the way home to his manor, Fowl checks his email and gets quite a shock. His father, presumed dead for three years, is asking for help: The Russian Mafiya has him, and they want cash. Artemis devises a plan, and all goes well --- until they run into Holly Short (the kidnapped fairy from the first book).<br />Look for better plot development and the same loveable characters in this lightweight but terrifically entertaining installment in the Artemis Fowl series.	2003-08-11

For many months, Fowl has been traveling the world in search of a fairy. He finally gets a hit and meets a fairy who has been passing as a healer in the human world. Using the information she gives him, Artemis devises a plan to abduct a fairy and take fairy gold for ransom. All goes well until the captive fairy's (Holly) rescuers show up.<br />I was spellbound (darn fairies!) throughout the book. It was well written and told a captivating tale. It's sure to enchant other readers, especially those looking for something post-Harry Potter.	2003-08-11

Reading Stet is like taking a seminar in the art and craft of editing and then being invited to tea with the professor afterward. While reading it, I remembered that the relationships most responsible for shaping my professional life were those I enjoyed with professors who made themselves available outside of the classroom or office. I was particularly lucky over the course of college and graduate school to enjoy the company of three wise, interesting, experienced scholars who had spent what amounted to a whole lifetime in the \\"real world\\" before beginning their academic careers. That Athill's finely crafted memoir reminded me of my debt to Dr. A-, Mr. R-, and Mrs. S- is the highest recommendation I can give. <br />Consider this gem:<br />\\"[A]n editor must never expect thanks (sometimes they come, but them must always be seen as a bonus). We must always remember that we are only midwives - if we want praise for progeny we must give birth to our own.\\"<br />Or this (she is writing about the shrinking population of critical readers):<br />\\"Of course a lot of them still read; but progressively a smaller lot, and fewer and fewer can be bothered to dig into a book that offers any resistance. Although these people may seem stupid to us, they are no stupider than we are: they just enjoy different things.\\"<br />Whether you edit church bulletin or your city's daily, whether you answer phones at a small press in the hopes of moving up or you cull gems from the slush pile, don't miss Athill's attempt to prevent her experience from being erased with her passing.	2002-08-23

My son wrote the following mini-review:<br />Taken from his home on Earth, Ender Wiggin is shuttled off to battle school, where young boys and occasionally girls are taught the ways of warriors and trained to fight in the war between humans and buggers. The children are separated into armies and thrown into mock battles in a special room in which they become weightless.<br />Ender swiftly moves through the ranks and soon leads an army of his own. Only later does he learn that the commanders of the school are training him to lead the humans to victory during the Third Invasion.<br />What I thought was going to be an &quot;easy&quot; Star Wars type of book was actually a book that turned me into an upright, wide-eyed, page-turning mad man; Ender's Game could not be left untouched for long.<br />My favorite scenes took place in the battle room. I wondered, What new tactics will Ender come up with this time? And the ending! Wow, was that a shock... for Ender and the reader.<br />JFS	2002-08-23

Afterward, our son wrote the following essay:<br />Since The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien was offered as an option for our family book club, I've been asking for it each month. In August, my pleas were granted, and we started the book well before The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring arrives in theaters.<br />A quick summary of \\"the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings\\": The comfortable hobbit Bilbo Baggins smokes his pipe, relaxes in his easy chair, watches the stars. He leads a peaceful life until Gandalf, an old white wizard, comes along and changes it forever. In spite of his Tookish ancestors, Mr. Baggins is a \\"lazy\\" hobbit who doesn't want adventures: \\"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them.\\" (p. 4) Of course, then, he is quite suprised when he is called to serve as a professional burglar for a band of thirteen dwarves. Later, he's even called upon to kill Smaug, a dragon with a diabolical appearance and a mammoth appetite. Of the thirteen dwarves, Thorin is the most eager to see Smaug die, for a few of the villages Smaug has destroyed were part of the kingdom of Thorin's fathers and forefathers, making Thorin the King Under the Mountain - not Smuag! With no choice but to join them, the hobbit has no idea of the dangers he must face to reach his goal, no idea how to kill a dragon (let alone a dragon who has been the glorious victor of who knows how many battles).<br />My favorite part of their adventure takes place in the Elvenking's palace, when Bilbo is devising a plan to save the dwarves. He decides to put them all in barrels to be rafted off with the other empty barrels sent to \\"the Long Lake... a town of Men still throve there.\\" This plan gets them out of the castle without being seen. But, as Tolkien points out, \\"It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but I don't suppose you would have done half as well as him yourselves in his place. Of course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there any one to pack him in, even if there had been a chance!\\" (p.182)<br /><br />The mastermind of this journey, J.R.R. Tolkien, and C.S. Lewis (Chronicles of Narnia) were friends, colleagues, and masters of fantasy. We can see the influence of the Chronicles on the many series written for younger readers today. Tolkien's influence can be seen in series that appeal to more advanced readers; The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are the \\"granddaddy\\" of the sci-fi/fantasy genre.<br /><br />In The Hobbit, Tolkien relies on the power of the mythological \\"hero's journey.\\" Bilbo has a lot in common with Odysseus of Homer's Odyssey (perhaps the original hero) and Luke Skywalker of the Star Wars epic, a hero whose story was told four decades after Bilbo's. Hero stories teach us about our own potential. Heroes are called to journey and adventure for their heart's desire (Bilbo and Odysseus both want to return home, for example), but they must fight evil and learn about themselves before they can achieve their goals. Each of the heroes I mentioned are guided by mentors or wise guides: Odysseus by Athene, Luke by Obi-Won, and Bilbo by Gandalf.  They each benefit from a magical talisman or sacred object: Odysseus has his magical bow and quiver of arrows and assorted amulets Athene and others provide during his twenty-year journey home; Luke Skywalker wields his father's lightsaber; and Bilbo has Sting, a short sword made by Elves, and the invisibility ring. In each of their stories, the hero must enter the \\"underworld,\\" a classic mythological detail. They are also encounter ugly, horrible beasts on land and in water, adding chilling action and, in some cases, humor to the stories. The heroes also, I might add, eventually achieve their goals.<br /><br />The Fellowship of the Rings is our next book club selection. I look forward to more of the same exciting and enchanting elements that made The Hobbit so memorable.r /><br />The Fellowship of the Rings is our next book club selection.

Time Warp Trio books are entertaining and easy to read and were probably written to encourage kids who don't usually read much to read more.

For nearly two decades, JCO has been one of a handful of writers whose works I purchase in hardcover the day they become available. So, make no mistake, by any measure against other writers' work, this is a five-star read: suspenseful, harrowing, &quot;true.&quot;<br />But when I think about the body of work Oates has penned under the pseudonym &quot;Rosamond Smith,&quot; I find that The Barrens falls short of the excellence she has achieved in this genre in, for example, Nemesis and Lives of the Twins.<br />Also (and now perhaps I am being unfair by comparing her Smith work to her Oates work), I think JCO presents readers with a far more memorable psychopath in the groundbreaking (and chillingly realistic) Zombie, a slim volume that reminds us that serial killers are people, too.	2001-07-05

In preparation for our &quot;meeting,&quot; my son wrote the following:<br />You've probably heard of Tom Sawyer, but have you ever thought about him? For example, have you wondered, \\"Is he like me somehow?\\" Or when somebody mentioned Tom Sawyer, have you thought \\"Oh, yeah. I've heard of him. Protagonist in one of Twain's (Clemens') many novels. Little rascal.\\" Sure, Tom is a rascal, but he's not bad; he's nothing more than a boy looking for more than the world can give him.<br />Twain keeps this \\"history of a boy\\" (p. 208) simple: We do not witness a complete bildungsroman (\\"growing up story\\"), which makes the story arc easy to grasp and leaves Twain the ability to revisit the characters as adults. He concludes, \\"Some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present.\\" (p. 208)  Twain also makes Tom's story more enjoyable by jumping in every now and then, putting his own opinion into the storyline. For example, in \\"The Pinch-Bug and His Prey,\\" a chapter about the townsfolk going to church, he notes, that the \\"solemn hush\\" of the congregation is \\"only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir.\\" He continues, \\"There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago, I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.\\" (p. 31)  The author also makes the scenes in the book match the words on the page. For example, in describing a school pageant, he recreates the boredom of the event by describing (in some cases, repeating) each dull speech. This is the opposite of his style in, say, the chapters concerning Injun Joe, which are exciting, suspenseful, and far from dull.<br />Another thing that adds a little \\"jazz\\" to the bookis that Tom teams up with none other than Huckleberry Finn, the bad influence on the kids of the town. \\"Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad - and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him.\\" (p. 38)<br />As well as a great book to introduce Twain to kids, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a novel for anyone who enjoys adventure, humor, and a partial love story, all in one package. At the top of my adventure story list, this book gave me two weeks of enjoyment. Thank you, Mark Twain!	2001-07-05

Like John Taylor Gatto's Dumbing Us Down, Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death, and Daniel Boorstein's The Image, Berman's The Twilight of American Culture is a book that inspires copious note-taking and several runs to the library to find the many texts to which he refers in making his impassioned argument for a monastic approach to preserving what is best about our culture.<br />Writes Berman, &quot;Our entire consciousness, our intellectual-mental life, is being Starbuckized, condensed into a prefabricated designer look in a way that is reminiscent of that brilliant, terrible film, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers (a great metaphor for our time).&quot;<br />Other reviewers may offer an erudite deconstruction of Berman's text; admittedly, his argument is flawed in places. But I am not as concerned with Berman's missteps because his abiding conviction that we must quietly, monastically pursue the preservation of what is best about our culture -- our history, our literature and music, our scientific knowledge, our ability to critically reason -- resonates with me.<br />In short, eschew McWorld. Be not afraid when you allude to Shakespeare, the bible, or Dickens and your audience looks at you askance. Be an alien in our culture's &quot;hardening phase,&quot; when its form is preserved but its content is lost. Be like a lonely monk, gathering scraps of what is best about about us for the civilizations that follow after our dark age.	2001-06-15

Their secret leaks out, and the five are made national heroes for fighting hideous battles against the Yeerks; their weapon -- the ability to morph into animals. The cliffhanger ending surprised me because The Beginning is the last Animorph Applegate will ever write.	2001-06-15

Along the way, they encounter love, magic, friendship, and a lot of fights with the ominous draconians.

US	52933856	R33H0Q5LGRQCDZ	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	32	36	N	N	What a read!	In a recent writing assignment, my son noted:<br />My mom chose Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird as our family book club's March book. I flipped through, saw the number of pages, and thought, \\"Boring!\\" Later that night, I read the first page and discovered that the main character's brother was about my age and wanted to play football and own an air rifle. Then, a few days later, I continued reading and even though I found the writing a little \\"fancy,\\" I was finally able to find the beauty of Lee's book - it's a pretty \\"grown-up\\" story, but it's seen through the eyes of kids like me. That makes hard subjects easier to understand, which makes the book so much more interesting.<br />The novel is told from a young girl's perspective. Because the theme of racism, the subject of rape, and the idea of injustice are a little \\"over the top\\" - even for bright readers -Lee chose a young narrator to tell the story of a black man falsely accused of raping a young white woman and one man's fight to free him. If the story had been told by an adult, readers would have to suffer through the unnecessary chit-chat, opinions, and worries of that perspective. Seeing Maycomb County through Scout's innocent eyes, however, prevents this \\"masterpiece of American literature\\" from being an \\"I-had-to-read-it\\" sort of book.<br />Scout, her brother Jem, and their father form one of many families of Maycomb County, Alabama. In that southern state during the Great Depression, \\"[t]here was no hurry for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy, and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.\\" As the novel begins, Scout is six and about to start school, where she will be criticized for coming to class already knowing how to read and write. Her young teacher scolds Scout: \\"Now you tell your father not to teach you anymore. It's best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him I'll take over from here and try to undo the damage.\\" (p. 17) Jem, a fifth-grader,allows his sister to join him in many of his adventures, including his plans with Dill to make Boo Radley come out. But he thinks Scout \\"is getting more like a girl every day.\\" (p. 52) The children's father, Atticus Finch, is a state legislator and one of the county's leading lawyers. He is selected to defend Tom Robinson, a Negro accused of rape.<br />Racism still exists today, but the problems don't compare to those described in To Kill a Mocking Bird. The main problem seems to be that Negroes are considered the least human of four kinds of people. As Jem tells Scout, \\"There's four kinds of folks in the world. There's the ordinary kind like us and the neighbors, there's the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, the kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes.\\" (p. 226) To make the point about Negroes being somehow less important than other folks, the author tells Tom's story. He is a Negro whose left arm is stripped of muscle from a childhood accident. He stops to help nineteen-year-old Mayella Ewell with several chores because, as Tom admits at his trial, \\"I felt right sorry for her, she seemed to try more'n the rest of `em\\" - referring to her family, who gathers their supplies from the nearby dump and whose father is a drunkard who beats them. When Bob Ewell catches his daughter hugging the black man, he accuses Tom of raping Mayella to save their family from disgrace. \\"And so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro who had the unmitigated temerity to `feel sorry' for a white woman has had to put his word against two white people's.\\" (p. 204) Atticus Finch does his best to make Tom a free man. His efforts, though, only buy more time from the jury, which still returns a guilty verdict. Unlike her brother, Scout believes that \\"there's just one kind of folks. Folks.\\" But Tom still ends up dead - shot as he tries to escape from punishment for a crime he did not (could not) commit.   To Kill a Mockingbird could be a pretty \\"heavy\\" book for young readers if it only concentrated on racism, rape, and Atticus Finch's unsuccessful attempt to free an innocent man. So Lee combines the story of Tom Robinson with the mythology surrounding the inscrutable Mr. Arthur Radley, whom Jem, Scout, and their summertime friend Dill call Boo Radley. One story about Boo is that he stabbed his father with scissors while cutting newspapers for his scrapbook. Another story has Boo scratching neighbors' door screens. Yet another says that he eats squirrels. Kids love creepy stories, and the antics of the three friends as they try to make Boo come out of his house give the novel light and humor.<br />Although I had a rough time \\"getting into\\" To Kill a Mockingbird, when I finally did I was surprised by how good it was. By the way, the book has such a cool title. I didn't understand it at all when I began the book. Then, in chapter 10, I realized where the title came from. \\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" (p. 90) But not until Scout says to her father, \\"Well, it'd be sort of like shootin' a mockingbird, wouldn't it?\\" (p. 270), did I realize who the book's mockingbirds were. I will read this book with my children someday and hope they will with theirs.	2001-04-01

In Death and the Oxford Box, the first Kate Ivory mystery, Stallwood did an able job of introducing a likeable writer/amateur sleuth, although the plot wasn't particularly compelling. In the third installment, Oxford Mourning, Stallwood adopted Rendell/Vine narrative techniques -- to solid (albeit amateurish) effect. In this, the second of the three Kate Ivory mysteries, however, character, plot, and technique coalesce to wonderfully entertaining result. Don't be put off by the crusty library setting; it is, in fact, one of the most intriguing aspects of the mystery.<br />The antics and volume of her neighbors are preventing Kate from concentrating on her manuscript. Worried that the advance will run out before she has finished the work, she reluctantly accepts friend and former lover Andrew's offer of a job tracking down the culprits in a series of Oxford library thefts. Excerpts from the troubling submissions of one anonymous student in a in a creative writing class parallel Kate's trail through the libraries of Oxford to California and back. How are these dark self-revelations related to Kate and the disappearance of rare books?<br />Alas, Stallwood's mysteries are now out of print. To feed your taste for the writer/English professor-turned-sleuth genre, then, seek out Joanne Dobson's Karen Pelletier mysteries, Edith Skom's Beth Austin series, and -- most recommended -- Amanda Cross' Kate Fansler books.	2001-02-23

If so, you will particularly enjoy Dobson's take on the (by today's standards) mild expose of small-town sex and scandal and Professor Karen Pelletier's involvement in the book's resurrection (and its author's incarceration).<br />If the series were only concerned with Pelletier's sleuthing skills, I never would have made it through the first (let alone the fourth) book. Dobson's real talent is in presenting a genuinely likeable character who has a great job, fun friends, and intriguing possibilities for her personal life. Karen Pelletier is such a compelling character that the reader forgives the occasional bit of sloppy writing and the contrived plot devices that pepper the series. <br />The Karen Pelletier mysteries are as addictive as movie-theater popcorn. If you like them, try the Kate Fansler mysteries by Amanda Cross (which set the standard for this genre), Veronica Stallwood's Kate Ivory novels, and Edith Skom's Beth Austin novels. I've recently discovered but not yet had the time to read two other authors in this genre: Carole Bugge and J.S. Borthwick.	2001-02-15

When my son and husband chose The Great Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for our monthly book discussion, I was certain I'd be bored senseless but figured it was only fair that they choose some of the titles, too.

As it turns out, recordings of the mysteries are available, as are films of the adventures. It will be interesting to see how these compare to the version in my head.<br />If you are sharing these stories with young readers, you may want to read the first story aloud.

The characters reminded me of the cardboard cast that a Lifetime or USA original movie would parade before me in the guise of presenting me with compelling individuals. A brilliant but beleaguered scholar for a father, a brilliant but bedeviled cellist for a mother, a brilliant but embattled artist for a husband... Gloria, the punk revolutionary turned English teacher, has quite a supporting cast for her little psychodrama. And let us not forget Jascha, the brilliant but bereft artist who wishes to assemble a retrospective of Bill's work (even though the grieving widower resented Bill's happy family). Argh! Tell me I wasn't the only one left cold by the overwrought characterizations and the forced plot line. <br />Necessary Madness isn't a bad book... nor is it a &quot;dazzling debut&quot; or &quot;breathtaking achievement.&quot; Admittedly, there were moments in which the widow's anguish was palpable (and believable), but the rest of the time I was left wondering what was on t.v.	2001-02-01

Partway through this short, tight mystery, I realized that Stallwood's attention to her characters was somewhat reminiscent of Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell's marvelous psychological studies masquerading as whodunnits. I say somewhat because Vine/Rendell is a master of the genre, whereas Stallwood is more of a reasonably apt pupil. Two Kate Ivory mysteries preceded this one, but I have not yet read them. That said, let me note that, in Oxford Mourning, the secondary characters of \\"the family\\" are more vividly portrayed than the sleuth herself. Not at all a disappointing way to spend a few hours, though.	2001-01-10

The Count plots to take control of the entire Baudelaire fortune, while treating the children very poorly, making them do all sorts of chores and providing them horrible living conditions.<br />The book had its ups and downs. For example, I thought the narrator's definitions and repeated warnings that the book was \\"very sad\\" were annoying, not funny (as I think the author intended). I didn't find \\"The Bad Beginning\\" that sad, probably because I'm a boy. Sure, it must have been pretty sad for the kids to learn that their parents had been charcoaled like hotdogs. But, to me, the book was intended to be read the same way you watch old silent movies (I saw some for the first time this summer ... neat stuff!): knowing it's funny because it's an exaggeration. I'm not putting the book down; don't get me wrong. I plan to read the rest of the series. One of its \\"ups,\\" by the way, was that the orphans' ideas were really cool....<br />When I shared my opinion of the book with my mom, who is also reading the series, we discussed how the book is actually plot-driven, not character-driven ... meaning, the focus is on what happens to the Baudelaire orphans, not who the Baudelaire orphans are. When you're done reading, you don't \\"know\\" Violet, Klaus, and Sunny the way you know Harry, Ron, and Hermione (from the Harry Potter series, of course), for example.<br />Anyway, if you're looking for a quick, fun read, try this.	2001-01-08

After several false starts when I just couldn't get past the first page because the suspension of belief was too much for a \\"realist\\" like me (Daemons! What bosh! thought I), Lyra's world finally worked its magic on me. Murder, politics, theology, kidnapping - it's not surprising that the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy enthralls readers of all ages. (I do wonder, however, how many folks in the 10 - 15 age group grasp the religious and mythical themes woven into Philip Pullman's deceptively simple narrative. Then again, does it matter?) The Golden Compass is not my typical fare (just look at the other titles I've reviewed), but I am now busy with its sequel, The Subtle Knife, and I look forward to the third book, The Amber Spyglass. Readers who have long appreciated the fantasy genre will think my remarks a bit vapid for I have little to compare Compass to... except, perhaps the Harry Potter collection, which I have enjoyed with my children but have deemed rather undemanding and not a little formulaic. For me, Compass is an epic reminiscent of the work of C.S. Lewis or even (dare I say it?) Tolkien. While the Potter series now enjoys an \\"instant classic\\" status (now there's an oxymoron) that is not part of the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy buzz, I think Pullman's work -- not J.K. Rowling's -- will prove to have the sort of shelf endurance that the Perelandra and Lord of the Rings books enjoy.	2001-01-02

The multi-layered narrative isn't difficult to follow, but the first third of the novel took its time in luring this reader into its center. Once the connection was established, however, this, the latest Atwood novel (and, deservedly, a Booker Prize-winner) was irresistible: I spent much of the holiday weekend absorbed by the interwoven stories of Iris, Laura, Alex, and the other dysfunctional souls in Assassin's cast of characters.<br />(If you liked The Blind Assassin, check out some of the other books I've reviewed. Happy reading!)	2000-12-28

For instance, if a homeless man dressed in a strange coat and reeking of onions approached me on the street and spoke in a foreign language, I would not stop to wonder, If I listened long enough, would he start making sense? No! I would walk away - quickly. Not Andrew J. Rusch, Jr. He stops and really listens to Onion John, leading to their friendship and, eventually, the concern and care of their home town, Serenity. I enjoyed the interesting ideas Onion John had; for example, making rain with a parade and driving ghosts and evil spirits away with smells. I also like the part of the story that dealt with the \\"race to space\\" and Andy's dad's desire for Andy to get to the moon. I tend to prefer more adventurous stories or stories with a little more \\"action,\\" which is why I chose to give Onion John four stars.	2000-10-01

It was Wise's recommendation that led me to the Mind Benders books, and my son and I learned a great deal working through the four A books. They were ample preparation for the more rigorous course of logic study we've undertaken this year.

I picked up this book from a remainder shelf at a local bookstore chain. I know, I know, my first mistake. What was painfully apparent in only the first five pages is that the book was horrendously edited. For example, the female protagonist is first spotted wearing a &quot;tea dress&quot; and Timberland boots, as she meets with two real estate professionals. Yet, in the same scene, she uses the bathroom of what we are led to believe will be her new home and struggles to pull her jeans over her hips after taking a contemplative dump!  I gave it only about ten more pages of absolute crap (pun and vulgarity intended), including banal, and, ultimately, pointless sexual references and encounters. Hoorah for Tony Strong! He has the dubious honor of being the author of the first book I have ever thrown away. Folks, don't waste your time or your money.	2000-09-20

Father Melancholy's Daughter, its sequel, Evensong, and A Mother and Two  Daughters are, for me, vintage Godwin. They set the standard for  penetrating characterization and unsettling glimpses into how people really  work. I picked up The Odd Woman with high hopes and was not utterly  disappointed. Flickers of the good things Godwin will accomplish in later  novels are abundant in this rather dense exploration of a &quot;spinster  professor's&quot; running inner dialogue. If this is your first go-around  with Godwin, however, skip this for the infinitely richer Father  Melancholy's Daughter or A Mother and Daughters.	2000-09-16

So, after hearing what a great read-aloud this book is, I decided to get it for my two youngest children. They certainly enjoyed the fun little story and the sweet illustrations. But from the first reading, its  conclusion bothered me. You see, the logical progression dictates that if  you give the mouse milk, he's going to want... a straw! Not a cookie,  folks. I thought it was just me, but on the third or fourth read-aloud, the  kids began &quot;reading&quot; along, and when we neared the end, I read,  &quot;And chances are if he asks for a glass of milk,&quot; and they  shouted in unison, &quot;He'll probably ask you for a straw.&quot;<br />Look,  this isn't meant to sound curmudgeonly. While it's far from a classic, the  book is cute. I just wish it didn't toy with budding logical intellects.	2000-07-18

My love of the violin came late -- only a year ago, in fact. Since then, I have busied myself aquiring CDs of wonderful violinists and reading everything I can about their lives and their work. I have even attempted to  learn this intricate instrument (but am realizing that I would be happier  if I stuck to my recordings and reading!). In any event, I really enjoyed  this book -- the stories of DeLay's talented (and not so talented)  students, their parents, her teaching &quot;style,&quot; etc. My only  criticism is that the writing is weak. It struck me as the work of someone  who is not entirely comfortable as a writer -- that is, Sand seems to be an  able researcher with a wonderful grasp of the import of her material, but  she has no real tools or passion to communicate her findings. Remarkably,  however, the subject carries the text and the reader really can get around  the writer's awkwardness. If you like music, teaching, and descriptions of  how the truly gifted &quot;make it,&quot; don't let the less than inspired  writing keep you away from this neat book.	2000-07-03

Sorry but the miscreants they describe  seem like anomalies to me, not the norm. I never see any of these  murderous, hateful, misogynous traits in my son or in his buds. Hey, call  me naive, but I believe  unceasing and loving involvement in our kids'  lives goes a long way to preventing the types of schoolroom and  street-corner tragedies we read about in the paper and hear about in the  evening news. In any event, I appreciate the message of War against Boys,  and I admire the point-by-point evisceration of the emasculating feminist  approach to raising and educating our sons. I just wish the argument didn't  sound quite so shrill. That criticism aside, this is a worthwhile addition  to the growing body of literature dedicated to reclaiming all that's  wonderful about our kids (including all of their many differences). Let's  hope it's not too late in coming.	2000-07-03

If you already knowthat ALL children (not just boys and not just girls) are at risk intoday's classrooms and schools; that physical punishment only inspires more bad behavior and, eventually, breeds violence; and that gender differences need only be respected not rigidly adhered to (i.e., respect a young man's tendency to &quot;hold back&quot; a little but don't adminish him for crying over the death of his goldfish, the frustration of learning a new subject, his failure to make the team, etc.), then you don't really &quot;need&quot; Raising Cain.<br />If, on the other hand, your sons, nephews, male students, etc. seem indecipherable to you, strike you as requiring a &quot;good spanking&quot; to &quot;shape them up,&quot; or appear to be &quot;little crybabies,&quot; you need more than Raising Cain or any other book can give you. <br />Do you see where I'm going with this? Parents on the &quot;right course&quot; with their kids already instinctively know much of what is presented in this book. They know because they've lived it. Anyone leading an examined life can see the potential &quot;hot issues&quot; in their parenting styles and will adapt them based on the individual needs of their children -- boys or girls.<br />In short, savvy parents (teachers, relatives, etc.) will find a few gems in this book. They will be validated in methods they are already employing in their interactions with the kids they know.  They will be reminded that all children are influenced by the adults in their lives. So, if you need gems, validation, or reminders, read Raising Cain. It is cleanly written, heartfelt, and laden with &quot;cases.&quot; If you're feeling pretty confident, though, pick up a good children's book -- like Holes, A Long Way from Chicago, or The Phantom Tollbooth -- and go read to the kids. They'll love it.	2000-06-27

But it's not strictly a &quot;guy book,&quot; either. It IS a terrific read -- the quintessential summer book: mass market paperback (i.e., easy to tote) and compelling story (i.e., difficult to put down). Elsewhere,  I've talked about being &quot;ruined by books,&quot; and I confess to being  partly ruined by The Perfect Storm. Trailers for the film moved me to pick  it up. (I've avoided the book for two years, thinking it was too  &quot;bestseller&quot; for my tastes.) The story of the Andrea Gail crew,  their fellow fishermen, their friends and family, and the most compelling  character in the book -- the sea itself -- drew me in and has not yet  released its hold on me. Don't miss the vicarious thrill, terror, and  wonder that Perfect Storm inspires. And pick it up before the movie. Let  the film complement the mental pictures your mind conjures as you read, not  dominate them.	2000-06-27

A Long Way from Chicago is a touching and very funny book. The narrator, Joey Dowdel, shares the experiences of visiting his thrifty, hardworking, no-nonsense grandmother. Each chapter tells the adventures his sister and  he have with his grandmother during each of seven week-long summer  vacations. Long Way takes place during the Great Depression (1929-1935), so  I learned some history while enjoying a great story. The coolest part of  the book is when Grandma gets Joey a ride in an old biplane; the funniest  is when the sheriff and his deputies drunkenly sing  about Paddy Murphy  while they're wearing only their underwear at the Rod and Gun Club. My  favorite character was Grandma Dowdel because of her use of words and the  way she loved people without saying it. I didn't pick out this book -- my  mom chose it as one of our read-alouds -- but, like everything she picks  out, this was really terrific. We shared a good cry at the end because we  realized that Grandma is a lot &quot;softer&quot; than her tough words and  actions showed. Happy reading!	2000-06-01

If you read a lot (more than a dozen books a month for pleasure), then you're probably familiar with the sensation of being ruined by a book. This happens when you realize that you never want it to end, can't bear not to  know more, can't believe this is the last sentence, and then can't find  another thing to read for upwards of a week because nothing else compares  to what you've just read. So it was for me and Behind the Scenes at the  Museum.  This is likely to be dubbed a \\"chick book.\\" So be it. If a  chick book is an amazing story that deftly spans generations of filial  dysfunction and decades of national history, making the reader alternately  weep and guffaw, then this is a chick book. It's also one helluva read,  twisting, building, then soaring to a climax that shatters the reader while  finally making the narrator whole.  It begins with the moment of Ruby  Lennox's birth, a device that usually bothers me (consider Tristam Shandy),  but Ruby more than hooked me by the end of the first chapter, and I wanted  her for a blood relative by the time she described her mother's love as  \\"autistic parenting.\\" That this is the author's first novel makes this book  even more amazing.

Kidder juxtaposes the wrenching images of residents struggling with dementia and rapidly failing health with those of residents  reaching out to one another in new friendships and coming to terms with  their pasts. He deals frankly with the disadvantages of even the finest  nursing home care: under-staffing, lack of empathy for residents,  loneliness, and even lousy food. And he doesn't hesitate to acknowledge the  imminence of death in such places.  But, ultimately, this isn't a sad  or depressing book. Joe and Lou accept that death is close, but they also  learn to reconcile who they've been with who they've become. They find  comfort and joy in their friendship, and their conversations provoke more  smiles and quiet chuckles than tears. A topic that could have been rendered  maudlin by another writer becomes an engaging treatment in Kidder's prose.	2000-05-28

If you cry during reruns of Little House on the Prairie, you'll love this and the other four titles in the \\"beloved Mitford series.\\" This is the kind of reading that diehard nonfiction readers scoff at: too soft, too sweet.  But don't we all deserve to be touched by an angel once in a while?   The Mitford series centers on Father Tim, an aging priest who ministers to  the small by lively congregation of the Lord's Chapel. He is by turns  fussy, funny, and faithful (the kind of faith that is simply there, not  overdone, just a part of daily life). And Karon's gift as a writer is that  she allows his story to unfold. We discover the characters and the subplots  without the heavy hand of a writer who wants to ensure that we \\"get the  message,\\" and we're delighted in the process.  Even if your usual  bedtime fare is A Brief History of Time, I encourage you to visit this  little town for a while. You'll come away enriched.	2000-05-28

Young Ranofer, an orphan, lives with his half brother, Gebu, who beats and mistreats him. Ranofer discovers that there has been a thief at the goldsmith where he works. He thinks that it is Gebu's friend, Ibini, but later learns that Ibini is actually working for Gebu, who is behind the  thefts. Then, one night about six months later, a hungry Ranofer ventures  into Gebu's room, which is forbidden to Ranofer, for food; and he discovers  a golden goblet with hieroglyphics spelling out, \\"Thutmose the Conqueror\\"!  The discovery leads him to believe that Gebu is a tomb-raider. On the day  of the festival when the Nile rises and makes the soil rich with  nourishment, Ranofer secretly follows Gebu and Wenamon, the mason, into a  tomb. But they soon discover Ranofer and start chasing him. Ranofer  escapes, traps them in the tomb, and runs to tell the queen about the  tomb-raiders. At first, no one believes him, but then the queen sends some  people to investigate. When they find out what Ranofer has said is true,  the queen rewards Ranofer with the donkey he asks for.   Because I  enjoy reading about Egypt, this book was fun to read. It was a good  adventure and mystery. I recommend it to other people who also enjoy  mysteries and adventures.	2000-04-04

If you and your family are also stimulated by great books, the lessons of history, the wonders of science, and the magic of learning another language, then you will discover treasures in this volume, to say  nothing of superb recommendations for mastering a program of academic  excellence. Jessie Wise has assembled THE reference book for people who  choose to blend the best of family-centered, home-based learning with a  rigorous quest for academic excellence. Her own experience is obviously  Christian in perspective, but, where appropriate, she presents excellent  alternatives for secular homeschoolers in her year-by-year approach to  classical education, including books, schedules, and resources. So stop  wandering the library, bookstores, teacher supply stores, and Internet.  Save yourself time and money by referring to the meticulously researched  resource lists presented in The Well-Trained Mind. (Note that movements  exist within movements, and homeschooling is no exception. Unschoolers,  school-at-homers, unit study devotees, John Holt fans - the list goes on  and on, and the dissension among the ranks grows louder (and nastier) as  each submovement asserts its preferences and points its finger at the  shortcomings of the others. But while Wise's book is decidedly not one for  those who subscribe to pure child-led learning and unschooling, she does  not denigrate the choices these homeschoolers make.)	2000-04-02

He learns the differences between man today and in the future. I enjoyed the book for the author's ability tell a good story. My favorite  part is when the \\"time traveler\\" fights the Morlocks. Some books, such as  this one, make me think that I'm inside the book fighting of Morlocks or  whatever. But it's very rare that an author has this talent.	1999-12-07

It is also the first book I've read in a fairytale style. At first I thought I wouldn't enjoy Clockwork because I usually don't read fairytales,  but once I got into it, I started to enjoy it! It was scary, and I like  scary stories. It was also very complex, a sort of story inside a story  inside a story - if you know what I mean. I recommend this book for older  kids. My favorite part is when Fritz the writer is reading his story.	1999-12-07

The Mutiny on Board HMS Bounty is about a captain named William Bligh, his crew, and their journey. The mutiny starts because Christian, one of Bligh's crew, wants power, and the mutiny starts with nothing to stop it.  The mutiny leads to Captain Bligh and the people who did not mutiny against  him being forced into a small boat, called a launch, with only a little bit  of water and food and four cutlasses. They work themselves through storms,  sicknesses, and islands full of ambushing natives. Bligh and his loyal crew  make it back to England five months after being cast off the Bounty. The  mutineers get a nasty shock when they return to their homeland of England!  I enjoyed this book because it was full of adventure. My favorite part is  when is when they are fighting the natives.	1999-12-07

(The pilot has a heart attack and crashes the plane.) To survive, Brian has to rely purely on his instincts about what to eat, what to do or not do. I enjoyed this story because it  was full of adventure. My favorite part is when Brian, who lives on his own  for 54 days, finds \\"the survival pack.\\" Hatchet would have been an even  better book had it not been so concerned with \\"the secret.\\" Without this  part of the plot, it would have been strictly a survival story, which is  really where the author did the best storytelling. If you enjoy this book,  I recommend My Side of The Mountain and On the Far Side of the Mountain.  Both are by Jean Craighead George.	1999-11-22

I particularly liked the part when Chester meets Mr. Smedley, who is a music teacher. Mr. Smedley is so surprised to learn that Chester, a cricket, can play scales and songs! After reading The Cricket in Times Square, try The Phantom Tollbooth, one of my favorites. It also has both animals and humans as main characters.	1999-11-15

Rousing discussions of good literature layered with subtle narratives of the key participants' lives. Natch! This book wastes the reader's time. What's particularly disturbing is that something so poorly and  unimaginatively written got past a junior editor's first read, let alone  got published. Save your time. Save your money.	1999-08-20

Oates, frequently (and annoyingly) labelled our &quot;most prolific&quot; writer, has amassed a considerable volume of work -- novels, short stories, poetry, plays, essays. Her range is amazing, limitless (though her productivity has become somewhat of a literary joke). As a &quot;subject,&quot; Oates has challenged interviewers to present the &quot;real&quot; Joyce Carol Oates. She herself is quite taken with the many faces of JCO -- writer, wife, teacher. So, apparently, was her biographer. Unfortunately, Johnson never gets far enough past his admiration of this underappreciated writer to actually reveal anything new about her. The biography begins promisingly enough with a retelling of Oates's family life and education. But from there, it begins to unravel, relying on a chronological record of Oates' writing life. While Johnson does an admirable job of describing Oates's passionate and incredibly committed approach to her craft, his &quot;love&quot; for his subject hardly allows for an objective presentation. One can almost hear Oates editing him: &quot;No, not that way. It wasn't like that. Rather...&quot; Nevertheless, devoted Oates readers will appreciate this book. It is slow-going, and the biographer has certainly &quot;glossed over&quot; certain thorny issues in his retelling of the Oates myth (e.g., her anorexia, her &quot;perfect&quot; marriage, her &quot;rivalries&quot; with other writers), but the book offers neat insights into the writing life (the successful writing life) and intelligent comments on Oates' work, particularly her fiction.	1998-05-28
