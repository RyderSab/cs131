This is a supreme book for shedding old, unwanted belief systems and thinking patterns that can block prosperity in one's life.  I have read many books on prosperity, and none of them have impacted me as much as this one has.  I could literally feel my consciousness being cleared of poverty thinking and false beliefs as I read the book.  The author does an excellent job of recounting inspirational anecdotes and examples of how others have successfully enlisted God's help in attracting financial prosperity into their lives.  This helped me enormously, as it illustrated that if they can do it, surely I can as well!<br />I especially recommend this book for anyone who does spiritually-related work for a living (i.e., ministerial work, spiritual counseling and teaching, etc.).  Sometimes, we can hold the erroneous belief that poverty is holy, and we should not accept money for helping others in a spiritual way.  However, we must accept money for our work if we expect to do things like eat, keep a roof over our heads  and pay our bills!  Catherine Ponder helped me to eradicate some remaining resistance I had to accepting money for spiritual work, and I am eternally blessed and grateful as a result.  The book also helped me to resolve old beliefs that there is only so much to go around.  In truth, we live in a completely abundant and prosperous universe, and God can provide for everyone's needs abundantly, prosperously, and simultaneously.  The more people who realize this and put these principles into practice, the more we will experience this on our planet.  Please go within and ask for higher guidance to see if this book is right for you- it has already brought many, many people a host of Divine blessings!	2002-06-24

The book contains powerful channeled messages from the angelic realm on topics different from Doreen's book &quot;Angel Therapy.&quot;  It also contains a section in which the angels answer specific questions Doreen has posed to them, which I found quite intriguing.  I know this book will be a major success because of its' innovative format and the new topics covered.<br />In addition, the second portion of the book takes an in-depth look at how to communcaite with the angels on your own, and provides very detailed information on how to distinguish if you are really receiving messages from Heaven, or if you are receiving messages from your lower self (which all people do!).  I am so impressed by the clarity and the content of this part of the book.  It is quite user-friendly and easy to understand, making it possible for everyone to expand upon their current capabilities in regard to spiritual communication.  <br />Another  section of the book which I was particularly excited about is the introduction of information about more of the Archangels.  Their names and specific functions are included, making it easy to know who to call on for what.  <br />I am thrilled about this enlightening and fascinating book, and I am sure that many other people will be as well!

Spiritual communicator and author Doreen Virtue provides blessings for all parents and teachers of children with the information she brings forth in this book. Learn how you can better understand and relate to the vast majority of the children ages 0-24 on the planet right now, and learn tools and techniques that are vitally important to the well-being of these amazing children. Dr. Virtue discusses in great deal the negative effects of the prescription drug ritalin, and what you can do if a child you know is on the drug, but could instead be treated with natural, more humane methods. She outlines the dangers of ritalin and other psychotropic drugs, shedding light on a subject that many people know very little about.<br />The book also contains practical, down-to-earth guidance and advice on how to talk to Indigo children, help them improve their grades, health, physical bodies and emotions, and tune into their spiritual gifts and inner knowledge. There is specific guidance about food and dietary intake to keep blood sugar levels healthy, and how certain foods can positively affect the overall health, well-being, and even behavior patterns of Indigo children. Doreen also addresses the topic of Indigo children seeing into the spirit world (angels, deceased loved ones, etc.) and how you can help the children understand these visions so they are not frightened by them. It is a manual that the angels would like all adults involved with children to have, for easy reference and powerful guidance in healing issues that tend to arise with these special kids. The book also explains how to determine if you or your child (or a child you know) is an Indigo.  And, there are detailed, dynamic interviews with Indigo children, which enables adults to better understand these special kids' perpectives, and how to deal with their behaviorial issues.  I also found the information on astrology quite interesting, as it outlines particular traits of the various sun signs and helps you understand yourself and your children more thoroughly.  A must-have for anyone on a spiritual path who desires to learn more about helping these unique children!	2001-09-03

It helps one to make informed decisions on the very personal choice of whether to eat meat and animal products. I became a vegetarian over two years ago after reading Dr. Virtue's book Divine Guidance, where she states that she was informed during meditation that her clairvoyance was being inhibited by eating meat and ingesting the pain from the animal flesh.  <br />I highly recommend this book. I love the practical, how-to information included on how to shop for and prepare vegetarian food, as well as tips on how to order vegan and vegetarian meals in restaurants, and how to handle situations like eating meals with family and friends who do not follow a vegetarian lifestyle. The book is sized small enough so you can even take it with you in your purse or pocket to restaurants and health food stores for easy reference. It is a highly educational companion for anyone on a spiritual path, or anyone simply looking to make more healthful choices in their life.	2001-08-01

I absolutely loved reading about the predicted New Age of Peace, and I discovered my chosen &quot;age outs&quot; for this lifetime, simply by asking my angels after readings  Doreen's discussion of this topic in the book.<br />I have also had some  incredibly powerful and insightful experiences with the chapter on the  meanings of specific number sequences.  As a claircognizant and  clairaudient, the angels and ascended masters can simply tell me which  number sequence they want me to read at any particular moment, and I have  actually gotten to the point where I have many of the meanings committed to  memory.  <br />Even if you do not have your communication channels fully open,  you can still receive these powerful messages simply by noticing when you  keep seeing certain number sequences.  These are indeed very powerful,  healing messages.... ...Doreen has provided this easy-to read format to  her readers, so that they can more effectively communicate with us.

The cards are a great way for the angels to communicate ideas, inspiration and guidance to us in an organized fashion,  allowing us to see a clear pattern of what is going on in our lives.  I  have even received powerful insight about events that have happened in my  immmediate past while doing a card spread for myself.  For instance, I  recently did a card spread where the card for Archangel Michael was in my  immediate past.  I asked the angels what the specific message was from this  card, since Michale is with me at all times.  I clairvoyantly saw an image  of Michael next to me at work while I was speaking my spiritual truth to a  co-worker.  Although I was unaware of it at the time, Michael was giving me  the courage to speak my truth in that situation.<br />Even if your spiritual  communication channels are not fully opened, the cards are an amazing tool  in which to receive guidance from God and the angels.  A guidebook is  included, and there is no &quot;wrong&quot; way to use the cards.  Your  intuition will tell you the meaning of the cards if they differ from that  of the guidebook.<br />I highly recommend these cards to anyone desiring a  deeper connection with their angels.  As with all angelic communication,  the card messages are always completely centered in Divine love and light!	2000-06-21

I originally wrote a review of this book a couple of years ago, and I feel compelled to add some additional comments.  This book completely changed my life, and I have seen the material in the book change the lives of others as well.  <br />For those who are open-minded, the book provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for communicating more fully with the Divine on your own.  Dr. Virtue emphasizes a positive, easy-does-it approach that anyone can use, and she explains intuition in clear and simple terms that we can all understand.  For people who may have a more skeptical approach to new age spirituality and metaphysics, the book provides a new level of understanding as far as angelic communication and intuition is concerned.  I myself am a former skeptic, but reading the book helped me to have my own experiences that convinced me of the presence of angels in my life, and I now communicate with them on a full-time basis.  Many of my angel reading clients have had similar experiences.  This book is not about reading someone else's truth- it's about finding your own truth and having experiences in your life to reflect a higher level of understanding your relationship with God and the angelic realm.  <br />Dr. Doreen Virtue has published a truly priceless piece of work in Divine Guidance. She teaches all readers about their inner divinity, and shows them how they can easily have clear, open communications with God's angels. If you yearn for something deeper that is missing your life, you can reconnect with your true self, God, and all of the angels by learning the simple steps described in Doreen's book.

Have you ever thought about what your true purpose in life is? Let Dr. Doreen Virtue and the angels help you to manifest your dream life- right now! Doreen gives an insightful lecture on manifestation on side one of the tape, and side two contains a powerful meditation where your Guardian Angel will take you one year into your future, so you can see your ideal life fully manifested. <br />I have read some other reviews of this tape, and I feel it is important to point out that when reading about other people's experiences, whether they are interpreted as positive or not, you should take certain factors into consideration.  We all sometimes receive messages from our lower selves, or egos, rather than our higher selves and the angels.  Sometimes messages from the lower self can be easily misinterpreted, and fear sets in as a result.  I truly feel compassion for anyone who felt they had a frightening experience with this tape, but I temper that with the knowledge that the angels never show us anything fear-based or scary- quite the opposite!  Yes, they may prepare us for big life changes, but they always do so in a manner which feels loving and supportive, not fearful and scary.  Also, it is imperative to point out that the author of any guided meditation program cannot be held personally responsible for the particular visions that users may experience- I'm sure everyone will agree that this is basic common sense.  We are all responsible for our own personal experiences and issues in life, and no one can change that. <br />I personally have really enjoyed working with this audiocassette.  Even if you know nothing about manifestation, do not be shy about ordering this tape. The angels seek to release you from your unfulfilling life, and help you soar into the life you truly deserve- right now!	2000-02-08
