One day a protestant preacher stops by their house and asks for food.  Not knowing who he is, they let him in and feed him.  In thanks, the preacher offers them a New Testament Bible.  They refuse, knowing it would cause trouble and anger the preist.  They have barely enough food for their family to survive on, so John goes to America to find a higher-paying job.  When John is away, Anna goes to the city and encounters the protestant preacher.  He asks her to come to his house so he can give her a Bible.  She is curious about the Bible, and wonders if it could be the answer to her longing heart.  Compelled yet frightened, Anna accepts the New Testament and hides it under her mattress at home.  Anna reads it with interest but doesn't let her children see it.  After John comes back and as time goes on, they wonder more and more about the New Testament. . . .	2004-11-02

She decides to face the painful memories.  She returns to her childhood home, thinking it will help her to get on with life. <br /> <br />Little by little, glimpses of the past come back to her, and it frightens her. <br /> <br />Then, she finds out her grandmother--Doris Crenshaw--bought her childhoom home.  Angry, Jessie drives to her grandmother's house, ready for a fight.  Her grandmother always wanted to own everything.  First she stole Jessie's mother--now this.  This was stealing a part of Jessie's childhood, leaving it uninhabited and cold.  No cheerful family lives in the house, no lights illuminate the windows. <br /> <br />When Jessie arrives at her grandmother's house, her nerve leaves her.  Her grandmother looks frailer than she remembers, but her manner is the same.  Chatty and in charge. <br /> <br />Andy McCormick, childhood friend of Jessie's, shows up one day when she meets with her friend Mrs. Robinette, who works at the ice cream shop in her hometown.  Andy and Jessie strike up a friendship again, talking of old days and new. <br /> <br />As their friendship is reestablished, they go back to Jessie's old house.  Memories come back, and Jessie finds herself sharing some of them with Andy. <br /> <br />Andy has his own problems, and they intensify when he realizes his affection for Jessie is growing.  Andy's parents think he is a Christian, as he once thought.  Now, he knows he is not, for doubts of the Bible's authenticity plague him.  Jessie herself is not a Christian, he finds.  His parents would never understand why he would be interested in a non-Christian, and he also doesn't want to marry a non-Christian.  Yet he can't marry a Christian while he is not one. <br /> <br />Can Jessie and Andy face their past--and their future? <br /> <br />With doses of humor, mystery, and sorrow, David Lewis has written a candid and poignant novel that I will not soon forget.	2004-10-26

He is assigned the job of nailing a counterfeiter named Mick (and seeing if Mick's family is in on the crime).<br />He uses the cover of a drifter on a motercycle.  While he's on the road to the small town in Montana where Mick is assumed to operate, he slams on his brakes to avoid hitting a deer, wipes out, and hits the pavement.<br />Michelle, driving along in her car, is right next to the biker and sees him fall.  She stops, telling her friend on her cell phone to call an ambulence.  Michelle goes to the man's side--he is in and out of consciousness.<br />Gabe blurts out his name as Brody to a fireman and adds, &quot;Brody Gabriel.&quot;<br />Then he recognizes Michelle as the counterfeiter's neice.  She is a lovely blonde, and seems so sweet.  She couldn't be tied up with the counterfeiting ring--could she?<br />After he is taken to the emergency room and is bandaged up, he finds that Michelle is there waiting for him.<br />Michelle offers a spare bedroom for Brody to stay in temporarily.  Brody is elated at being in such a good place to gain information about the family.<br />As Michelle gets to know Brody better, she admires him more and more.  She realizes she shouldn't get her hopes up, though, because he wouldn't be staying.<br />Brody is also increasingly convinced of Michelle's goodness and innocence--and he falls in love.<br />Will Michelle's past hurts allow her to trust in Brody's love?  Can she believe that Brody wasn't just using her and that he actually wants to marry her?<br />It's a bit strange the way this story skips (without breaks, sometimes) from one person's viewpoint to another's--certainly unusual.  But in a way it's neat to know what they're both thinking in the same scene.<br />This story kept me reading.  It is a sweet, basically good Christian romance (with some kissing).	2004-07-08

Will Dylan believe her, and forgive her for her lies?  Will he realize that true love is patient?<br />A good read with some suspence and quite a lot of romance (some kissing, too).  It's definitely more decent than a lot of romance novels these days.	2004-07-08

Once I stopped trying as much to figure out everything and just read for reading's sake, it was quite interesting.  I could identify with having fantasies, because I often imagine talking to people I know (not characters from my stories, though I do write) and being more outspoken than I am in real life.<BR>I laughed a few times and sort of got into the mystery of things, but I was expecting more of an explanation of things in the end.<BR>Maybe if I read it a second time I could figure things out better, but I don't think I want to read it again (for several years, anyway).<BR>At the end, I went back and checked off all the book titles Toby McKenna mentioned to see if he named them all on the list.  I think he did, but I missed a few when I went back to check.<BR>It's an original and interesting story idea, but I think it could have been better.  I was expecting it to be highly exciting from the reviews on the back cover and inside the book, and while there were moments of excitement, I wasn't so impressed with it as the other writers were.<BR>Interesting how Stephen Bly even mentioned himself/his books in this novel. ;)<br />*Spoilers*<br />How could the lady and the boy not be real if Mr. Watson had tears on his shirt from her crying?

Mim and her mother go to Isreal to help out with other women.  Mim stays overnight with a Muslim family during the fast of Ramadan.  The next day, she goes out with the family, and Israeli soldiers take Mim's Muslim friend, Rebiha, away in their jeep after Rebiha insults one of them.<br />Mim, after walking in the heat with the others, falls in a faint, weak from lack of food.<br />Mim's mother travels on without her, letting Mim stay and recuperate with an American archaeologist and his son.  While they are away on a dig, Mim dares to go to the police to tell them about Rebiha's capture, and that Rebiha is innocent.  They don't believe her.<br />Mim is soon well enough to go on digs herself, though she takes it easy at first.  One day, she finds an old artifact, which she sadly returns to the dig so they can send it to a museum.<br />While this is an interesting book, and I agree that we shouldn't be prejudiced against Muslims and Arabs (not all are terrorists), and I can even feel the pain and anger they must have felt in being driven out of their houses by the Israelis...I do think that God promised the land of Israel to the Jewish people.  Whether the way the Israelis drove out the Arabs was right or not, I don't think I know.<br />This book is meant to make you think and see the other side of things, and it did do that for me to some extent.	2004-03-30

That is, until he is accepted into the prestigious Harvard seminary.  New teaching, friends, and adventure soon follow.  The beautiful Morgan Hannah Collins wins Joshua's affection-from first sight-but he knows it couldn't possibly work out between them, so he tries to push thoughts of her out of his mind.  But-what if he did stay in Cambridge, start a church, and earn enough money for them both?    That dream is taken away when he is called home to see his sick father.  The people there need him, so he would live there and be the pastor.    As time goes on and his parents urge him to marry, he grows fond of a young lady named Constance.  This must be the wife he was meant to have.    Then, out of the blue, Hannah, his college friend, arrives.  She says she likes this countryside-could she possibly want to stay?  Apparently not, for as Joshua is called away to dinner with Constance, Hannah walks out of his life.    Joshua's two other college chums visit at different times.  The lure of gold reaches Joshua's ears, and he decides to follow.  He could find enough to build a wonderful church in his hometown!    His trek to California and his adventures after he arrives will keep you reading and guessing.  Will he ever find his true destiny, or did he pay too high of a price?    I like how the story switches back and forth from Joshua's journal.  It is a very interesting and thought-provoking story, and I'm sure I'll like Book 2, as well!    *Edited to add: Upon skimming this book and reading the end of it a second time, I like it much less than I did the first time. There is little meat, little maturity, and too much romance.	2003-12-25

Reminiscent of the classic \\"Jane Eyre\\" and Mrs. Hoff's earlier book, \\"Winds of Graystone Manor\\", this book captured my attention from page 1.  With multiple characters and scenes, it can be difficult to keep track or get into each person's life, but not here!  B. J. Hoff keeps each segment interesting, so you won't want to skip a single bit.<br />Susanna travels from Ireland to America to be a governess for her late sister's husband.  She immediately warms up to her neice, a sweet, intelligent young girl, and is surprised to find that Michael Emmanuel, her brother-in-law, is seemingly kind and pleasant.  What of her sister's descriptions of a dark, hard man and being so unhappy with him?<BR>Susanna begins to experience the captivating genius of Michael's musical talents, as well.<br />Bethany Cole, one of the few early woman doctors, is trying to establish herself and longs for her own private practice.  Andrew Carmichael, a young doctor, meets and likes Bethany, and asks her if she would like to join his practice and have her own room.  Bethany is happy to accept.  There is something Andrew is keeping from her--a dark secret, or an innocent one?<br />Conn McGovern decides to leave Ireland and go to America since things are getting hard in his native land.  His son, Aiden, is against leaving.  On the way to the shipyard, Conn runs into a street musician girl who seems to be in trouble.  After helping her out, he heads to the shipyard again.  The girl, Renny McGee, follows later on.<br />There are also a few interesting appearances from some famous people of the past, such as Fanny Crosby and Dwight L. Moody.<br />Painful partings, emotional upheavals, new hopes, soulful music, and spiritual journeys.  Add a touch of romance and mystery, and here is the result.  A wonderful book with stories of characters we can't help but love.	2003-08-06

Caroline Fletcher has grown up with slaves-but her mammy, Tessie, is one of her best friends.  She doesn't know how awful slavery is until one day when Tessie's son, Grady, is taken away to be sold.  Even then, being a young girl, Caroline puts the incident out of her mind after a while and goes on living the way she always did.  Adventures abound at Hilltop with her cousin Jonathan, but there again she sees the evil face of slavery.  When Caroline is older, she goes to live with her aunt for a few years.  There she meets her cousin, Robert, who falls in love with Caroline.  There, also, Caroline becomes an abolitionist.    Back in the South, Caroline sets out to spread abolitionist pamphlets.  She runs into an aggravating but handsome man, whom she tries to give a pamphlet to.  He tells her it is against the law.  They see each other again at a party, but still don't know each other's names.  They're too busy arguing about slavery.  Caroline learns later that the man's name is Charles.  They become more and more fond of each other, even though they differ on a big subject.    ...Despite the danger, Caroline decides to help with a daring rescue attempt.  Her problems escalate.    At first I may have thought the story had a bit too much telling/narrative, but then, as I got into it soon after starting, I enjoyed it very much.  I didn't want to leave, for the characters seem like living, breathing people, and the story touched me.  Written mostly in a first-person viewpoint, this is the story that Caroline writes-or Lynn Austin, rather.  Mrs. Austin uses her talent well in this charming, emotional, wonderful tale.	2003-02-04

Amy Beach's music is emotional and frolicking.  This book includes a biography and photos of Amy Beach, with amazing details of her early life of genius talent.  The music goes from some of Amy's early, easier works (from age 4 and up!) to her later, very impressive and difficult works.  I especially love &quot;Gavotte Fantastique&quot;, &quot;Scottish Legend&quot;, and &quot;Menuet Italien&quot;.  There are a number of duets included in this book, too, some of which are beautiful.

Karel and Sina, despite their differing opinions, have been friends for most of their lives.<BR>     Jama, a descendant of Ding (the van der Kemp's slave in the first book), is struggling to find his place among the Dutch Afrikaner, or Boers as they were commonly called.  He doesn't feel accepted by anyone but the van der Kemps, and he longs to marry, but finds no one he can relate with.  So, at the urgings of the Xhosa tribe king, Jama joins with their ranks.<BR>     After the Xhosas attack the Boers and leave the houses decimated, the van der Kemps, along with others, decide to leave South Africa and seek land by a peaceable arrangement with the Zulus.  Through hardship and heartache, the van der Kemps are victorious only by the Lord.<br />It did start slowly, but I still found it interesting.  Besides, the rest of the book more than makes up for it!  There was one part I especially liked--the imagery was so gripping and vivid (and scary, particularly if you're reading it at night like I was), but I won't give it away. =)	2002-06-29

I expected better, however, after reading high-star reviews of it.  It was exciting in parts, and romantic, too.  I like Kelly and Dave and the whole O'Malley family (though I haven't read the other books in the series yet).  The main thing that I didn't like so much was how detailed it got into how they were trying to figure out the mystery.  I wanted more action, less speculation and figuring.  Dee Henderson seems to know a lot about police work, and I give her credit for that, but wish she didn't have to impart so many details that I didn't always undestand.  I guess I'm a little picky.   Overall, though, I liked it a lot, and wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars.	2002-06-29

How could they stoop to stealing?<br />She leaves the group angrily, knowing it would likely be the end of her friendship, but too angry to care at the moment.<br />Then, Virginia hears some dreadful news that puts her in turmoil. . . .<br />As time goes on, Jenny and Virginia become friends again, of sorts.  Jenny comes over to the Simpson's house more and more frequently and is fondled by her family.  Virginia feels left out and jealous.  When it is too hard to bear, she goes by herself and sobs.  But she realizes she is wrong.  Wrong to feel jealous.  Her sister finds her and gently reproves her.  Virginia's awful burden of sin is too hard to bear anymore, and she prays to God, feeling a peace she's never known before.<br />From her sister's marriage, to the trial of a neighbor accused of theft, Virginia's story, The Tender Years, is a book that will touch you and keep you turning pages.  It is a book about forgiveness, love, friendship, and happiness that is found only in God.<br />It is a very good book for teens (or for anyone)!	2002-01-21

Twin brothers on opposite sides of the war--and life.<br />The characters didn't seem quite as good, or the plot quite so exciting or moving, as the others at first, but I still liked it a lot. The ending was really exciting and touching, and the romance was very nice and endearing. I liked this one better than the last book in the series, but the whole series is great!	2001-07-05

I loved this book--it's one of my favorites in the series, and one of my favorite novels!  It's just so emotional and deep and exciting...It also has romance (maybe a bit too much), adventure, and Christian values.  I was brought to tears, and I laughed...all of The American Family Portrait series is good, but this is one of my favorites, as I've said.  The characters in all of his books are so real!<br />Yes, there were some rather violent moments, almost gruesome, but it just brought me more concern and appreciation for the characters and all they went through.<br />I read it first when I was 14 or 15, and I'm looking forward to reading it again in future years!	2001-07-05

This was a very good story, with the same elements that are in the rest of the books in this series: adventure, emotion, romance, Christian values, drama, history, and even a little humor!<br />Three siblings take off in different directions--one to the high seas of pirates, one to an indian village, and one stays home but causes quite a stir among peole. Great storytelling with the same historical detail and life that's in the whole series!	2001-07-05

I especially liked Nathan Morgan (the photographer) and Allie (I think I remember the character's name right).  The book was as riveting as the others, but I didn't quite like the whole story as much, probably because of the more modern time period.  Still, it's a good read with the same emotion, drama, adventure, and romance as the others!	2001-07-05

It does show the awful situations of the 60's...I guess that's why I didn't like it as much; because of the immoral living condition of the college people.  And I also wasn't sure what to make of the ending, about the &quot;Jesus movement&quot;.  It seemed to be leading people to Christ, but it was an unusual and odd sort of thing, and I felt uncomfortable with it.  I'm sure the Lord did use the young people in that movement, but it just seemed to go against some of the Biblical principals.  Maybe not.<br />Anyway, I enjoyed the book over all--the war part was exciting and emotional, as well as the rest--and I hope Jack Cavanaugh continues to write these kinds of good historical novels!	2001-07-05

This one is probably my favorite out of the ones I've read.  It's pretty intriguing, although it's been a while since I read it so I kind of forget what happens!  I want to read it again sometime. These books are a Christian adventure series, and worth reading, especially for kids and teens.  They sort of remind me of the Hardy Boys. (I'm 17 years old, now, and read the Danny Orlis books from when I was 12-15.)	2000-11-23

This was an exciting story of a boy and his German Shepherd dog in the time of Word War II.

I don't remember too much about the story line, because I read it a long time ago, but I do know that it was one of my very favorites of Grace Livingston Hill's books.  I remember it being intriguing and touching and almost classic.  I play the piano, so, since Marcia did as well, that made  it all the better. I remember it having an exciting ending.	2000-05-02
