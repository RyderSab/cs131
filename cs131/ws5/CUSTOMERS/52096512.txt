I enjoyed his trip through the biblical landscape and his notes and interviews of people along the way.  At times he belabors points into the ground, literally the desert ground at times, and that can make the book drag.  Really this book is more about his spiritual journey and pilgrimage and sort of awakening then it is a travel log.  I like Feiler, but I liked him better in the Abraham book that was a lot less verbose.  Overall B-, but worth reading.	2005-07-08

Some of the others leave a bit more to be desired.  This book is a bit hard to follow because it is like reading a discussion.  Discussions are fine, in person.  When you have to read discussion, it can be a bit challenging.  This book puts forth some decent ideas and you can glean some wisdom from it, but it is not going to set the world on fire.  Not every book does.  JVD	2005-06-25

As usual I picked up this book, Dean Koontz's Frankenstein book 1, when I was traveling somewhere to read and take my mind off the flight.  It worked and the book was good.  But really, could they not have made the print smaller and made two books just one book?  The book did not have the bite of other Koontz novels, but he did share the writing.  It is a bit far fetched, but it is a good update on the classic work Frankenstein.  Overall - B JVD	2005-06-21

This book delves into the biblical concept of 'facing' reflecting the face of God to other people through your own face.  And, this book stresses the need to forgive in the redemptive power that is found in community.  Shults is at the top of his game in the book, easy to read yet highly intellectual at the same time - a hard pair to find in this day and age.  Sandage is also good to read in this book - the two together equal a book that is recommended for all who are interested in this topic.  JVD	2005-05-23

He gives example after example of research that shows your instinctive reaction is better than your thought out response.  I agree, but also have known this since 2nd grade when our teachers told us to go with the first answer that we put down.<br /><br />Gladwell rightly also makes the point that these gut decisions can be patently wrong as well, getting into race relations and gender among other topics.

I was a bit skeptical, but I was wrong.  This book encompasses much of what I have been studying with leadership, strengths, e.q., i.q., street smarts, and performing at a higher level - it is great.  While this book is general, it points you in the right direction to attain more from life.  Healthy living, focusing on what you are good at, using what God gave you, it is all in this book.<br /><br />I usually do not gush over books, but seriously, this is a great book.  It is one of those books that really makes you evaluate how you are living, and if you are putting your resources in the right direction.  This book applies across the board to many different kinds of people.  You will not be dissapointed.

While some have maligned this book calling it a reach, I disagree.  It makes sense.  This in-depth analysis of trends, and how they happen, how to make them happen, is really well done.  The think I enjoyed about this book is that the examples were from all walks of life, not just corporate.  Almost anyone can pick up this book, relate to what it is saying, and take something away from it.<br /><br />I would love to have a job where your job is to spot future trends.  There is a person in this book for whom that is her job.  She sits around in hip areas and watches what 'cool' people are wearing.  It makes sense, and it works.

After a few out there kind of weird books from Dean Koontz, he comes back to his roots with Odd Thomas.  Thomas is sort of like a psychic superhero who can see evil, and events that might happen.  And, oh yah, he can see the dead Elvis.  Any book with dead Elvis ghosting around in it is worth checking out.  This book has it's villains, has a hero, has a tragedy, and has a great conclusion.

It is rare you find a book that can really give you a look inside someone's head, especially inside the head of an autistic child.  The book has some really funny and sad parts, the marks of a great book.  This book is literature that should be required reading for students of all ages.

How does one influence the other?  Who should we minister to?  Tom relies heavily on statistics, so much so that the book is almost blinding at times.  One can really go into statistical overload reading this book.  With that said, Sine was ahead of the curve in 1999 predicting global terrorism before 9/11.  He also makes a strong case for ministering to the least of us, the homeless, etc.  This book has a pretty strong liberal bend to it, and still is useful.  Although a bit dated, it still picks up on trends of the McWorld globalization that is still occurring at a rapid rate.<br /><br />It is frightening to see in every town an office depot, target, old navy, petco, etc.  Its like no matter where you go you can get the same exact thing.

I picked up this book after hearing Brian speak at the Catalyst 2004 conference in Atlanta.  While I do not agree with everything he is working through in this book, I appreciate his heart and his search for a deeper sprituality found in seeking Christ.  Brian, unlike others in the emergent movement, seems more open to opinions other than his own.  He holds to his guns in this book, such as the need to participate in habitat saving events in his community, but leaves the door open for others who do not fully agree with him.<br /><br />I am always willing to engage with someone who is not close-minded.  Brian is humble, he writes about not having it all together, yet wanting to piece together what he knows.  This I can respect, and feel akin to a lot of the time.  The section of the book that is most challenging is the section on 'The Seven Jesus's.\\"  Brian take a good amount of time dissecting different views of Christ in different church traditions, pulling from each one.  He comes up with a sum that is greater than all the parts, and is hard to argue with.  Don't read this book if your opinions are set in stone - it will just bug you.  But, if you have an open mind and like to dialogue with others who push the envelope - than check it out.	2004-11-22

This book has been one that has perplexed me since I was a young believer.  Is this book to be taken literally?  Is the book figurative?  Is it somewhere in-between?  Bauckham falls into a general examination of the book, looking at the genre, the big issues, the themes, and specific issues that scholars debate in all circles.  This book is not an exegetical painful process, rather a good look at the big picture of revelation.  How should we apply it today?  Are we afraid that we will be 'left behind?'  Thank goodness Tim Lahaye made a DVD for those people who will be 'left behind.'  Anyway, on a more serious note, this book is a great introduction to the book of Revelation and will help almost anyone get around the book without feeling overwhelmed or lost.

The whole book revolved around the fact that we must be servant leaders as Christ modeled for us in the 1st Century.  Leighton is humble, and strong at the same time in his presentation of this material.  You can see the results of him putting this model into practice throughout his life and how God has used him to be an amazing influencer for the Kingdom.

Being from south Minneapolis, and living in this area for the past few years, I have heard endless amounts of chatter about this church.  The range of opinions is wide and mixed - some people it really hits home for, and others do not see it as their style.  The point Doug makes in this book, at least the way I read it, is that the church is not their to serve the needs of people who attend.  I agree with this 1000000%%<br /><br />The consumer mentality of many churchgoers is hard to get my head around sometimes.  I appreciate the humility that came across in this book by the author.  Doug just throws his ideas out there, includes many opinions from members of his community and lets you draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />One thing that was interesting to me about this book was that the title was about 'spiritual formation' but the book is really about the church, (which of course should include spiritual formation) so - the title is not super accurate, but the book is good.  It will stretch some readers, and other's will feel right at home.  I do think Doug and his community are trying to be Roman's to Romans and Jew's to Jews and so on and so forth..... for the kingdom.  Keep up the good work in Minneapolis!<br /><br />JVD	2004-11-10

I read it for a graduate school class in small groups & community and have some good thoughts after reading the book.  The good things:<br /><br />1)  Dan is honest and not full of himself.  He recounts what he has done in ministry and how it has morphed over the past few years.<br /><br />2)  He lets the reader know what is working where he is, without setting it up as a model for the rest of us in the world who might start up a ministry.<br /><br />3)  The emphasis on ancient / vintage worship and community is essential.  As we invite people into a community and let them 'ask in' to a faith committment it is a powerful witness for the kingdom.<br /><br />The 'interesting' things:<br /><br />1)  Why is Rick Warren featured so prominently in a book that is looking towards the future?  Rick Warren's extended defense of the seeker sensitive movement seems like a monument to the past when Dan's book is squarely looking towards the future.  This is not to disrespect Rick, but he was out of place in this book.  It is almost like the publisher pushed Dan to have Rick in the book so he would have more 'credibility' with the modern audience - who knows, but Rick seemed really out of place.<br /><br />2)  I do agree with some of the other reviewers who note that while Dan is not wanting to give a model for everyone to use, the second half of his book surely could be interpreted just that way.<br /><br />Overall - worth reading - Joseph Dworak	2004-11-09

Too many churches treat children's ministry like a babysitting service and an afterthought.  I work at a school that provides MA in Children's and Family ministries and the many many students we have in the program are getting a graduate education in Children's & Family ministries.  They are taking this seriuosly, their churches are taking it seriously, and so is George Barna in this book.<br /><br />There are many stats to back up what he is saying and it is done in plain english.  I appreciate the way Barna shares his research and does not seem so profit driven as other Christian writers from big publishing companies.<br /><br />This, is a good book.

First the good:  Po Bronson starts off strong in the first half of the book really getting to answering the question of what many people did to find out what they should do with their life.  I agree that these people were mainly upper-class, affluent, and had options to even be able to make such changes.  But, that was Po's circle - so he went with that.  There are seemingly endless people who were connected with the Clinton/Gore \\"revolution\\" in 1992, I missed the revolution part of Clinton/Gore, maybe because I was in high school.  Po is a good GenX writer - something we are seeing more and more of, and those from his generation will appreciates how he writes.<br /><br />The part of this book that is perplexing is when Po starts to give his subjects advice, sometimes to a good end, sometimes to a bad end.  He seemed to cross the line of journalist/counselor/writer it all gets blurry in the middle of the book.<br /><br />Overall this is a good book, solid B material.

What is incredibly helpful about the book:<br />1)  They give you straight up advice on who to use for helicoptor tours, kayak adventures, horseback riding, etc.  If you don't know you will simply default to whoever has the best and biggest ad at the Safeway store.  (which you can do at your own risk)<br />2)  They give legit, albeit short, reviews about places to eat &amp; sleep.<br />3)  They tell you where to stay, and more importantly, what the accomodations will be like.  They are usually dead on with their recommendations, because, again, they live there and do their homework.<br />4)  As far as locals whining about the fact that they point you in the direction of paths to hidden beaches and wonders, I would be annoyed if I was a local as well - but, nature is for everyone to enjoy, not just Kauai residents.  So, if you go exploring don't leave trash, don't walk on private property, and be respectful, no local can trash you for that.<br />Overall great book:  A<br />Joseph Dworak	2004-06-15

Larson does a tremendous job of weaving together the story of the 1893 world fair in Chicago, and the story of a serial killer who preyed on fairgoers.<br />This is a very interesting read.  Not only do you get a lot of the history of Chicago, you also get a look inside the mind of a serial killer.  Who would of thought these two things would go together so well.  A great book to take with you on vacation or to keep you busy in your lawn chair in the summer.  B+<br />Joseph Dworak	2004-06-14

Feiler takes an ecumenical look at three faiths, Islam, Judaism and Christianity - starting with Abraham.  Of note are the interviews Feiler performed with leading Islamic, Jewish and Christian scholars and holy men.  While the book does not draw any really solid conclusions it is a good place to start when looking at the religions originating out of the Torah.<br />I am sure Muslims will take issue with how they are portrayed by a Jewish author, and Christians may tend to do the same.  But, this does not mean it is not worth reading.  A good place to start when having a conversation about faith with someone outside your own tradition is to find common ground.  Feiler tries to do this in his book, and does it with some success.<br />Joseph Dworak	2004-05-13

McGrath takes a fresh look at the origin of essential church doctrines, and where they fall in current debates.  A wee bit conservative overall but still very usable.  Particular strengths would be McGrath is able to trace theological debate and discourse with a keen eye and enough detail for you to not lose your head.<br />On the doctrine of Christ he could have done a lot more in rebutting/refuting the Jesus Seminar / Historical Jesus Quest issues, but this does not take away from a very solid work.  I recommend this book to lay people, teachers, and pastors.  B<br />Joseph Dworak	2004-04-05

This book tackles many of the important issues facing someone struggling with whether to believe in God, believe in Christ, and many other things. Mixed in with these issues is Greg's theological stance that God can change his mind. Greg's view, or an 'open view' of God, is widely debated and much criticized.  Some from the Calvinist point of view will call him a herectic, cultist, and other productive terms that really help facilitate healthy dialogue.<br />This book is bigger than open view vs. calvinist theology - God is bigger than MUCH BIGGER - than this debate.  Take this book for what it is - a dialogue between someone who does not believe in God and someone who passionately believes in God - and go from there.  Most non-believers would have zero idea what the difference was between a calvinist and an open view theologian anyway, and quite frankly, an unbelieving world could care less.<br />While I don't necessarily see eye to eye with Greg and some parts of his theology, this is a great evangelistic tool.  All I know is that my wisest thought is dumber than God's dumbest thought, so I will just add my humble opinion to these reviews.  This is a good book, regardless of your theological stance.  God can use anything to change hearts and save souls, and he has used this book.	2004-03-26

He gives you a very in-depth look at most of the available research on the life of Paul.  He focuses on Paul's heritage as a Jew, Christian and Roman Citizen.  Then he turns to the theology of Paul, and is, for the most part, on point.<br />This book reads a bit like a lecture, but it still moves along at a decent pace.  Witherington helped me look at Paul's letters as a whole, and how they fit in the overarching metanarrative of God's redemptive plan.  So, for that he deserves high praise.  If you want to know more about Paul, probably more than you will ever need to know unless you are going to be a PhD in the New Testament, this is the book for you.<br />Joseph Dworak	2004-03-19

Jervell's argument for this book is found on page 16 where he states,<br />\\"In the last decades of the first century many Christian Jews left the church and returned to the synagogue.  There was obviously a relapse into Judaism.  Luke is writing Acts in order to prevent such a relapse.\\"<br />Jervell is out to prove that Paul is an apostle to the Jews, and that, \\"Christianity is true Judaism.\\"  (Powell 17)  How does he do in this venture?  It seems the tone throughout the book is one where if you dared to disagree with Jervell, you would have your head bitten off.  He is sure in his arguments regarding the theology of God in Acts, the Christ in Acts, the Spirit in Acts, the Law in Acts, and the role of the disciples in Acts.  He heavily emphasizes the role of God in Acts.  Almost to the point where you feel he is tipping the perfect balance of the Trinity.  God is seen, by Jervell, in Acts, as superior to Jesus or the Holy Spirit.  How can this be?  Maybe this was not his intent but the way in which he presents his argument one could certainly argue this is the case.  If we stick with his stated goal of showing the theology of Acts, he does this well, it is just not in line with balanced Trinitarian theology.  This heavy emphasis on God the father supports the argument that Christianity is true Judaism but again seems a bit skewed.<br /> It almost seems as if, to make his point, Jervell focuses heavily on the contextualization of Acts for the first century, but decries the fact that it is only an evangelistic document to the first century Jewish Christians who were relapsing to Orthodox Judaism.  When I read the Acts and hear Jesus saying to take the Gospel to Jerusalem, Judea-Samaria, and to the ends of the earth, I hear him saying this in regards to all people Jews and Gentiles.  Jervell does little to convince me otherwise.  Jervell is far too limited in his view of Acts.  As stated in the Mark Powell book &quot;What are they saying about Acts&quot; this is a \\"minority view\\" (Powell 71), and it should stay that way.  I prefer the both/and approach to the evangelistic nature of the book of Acts.  The theory that the mission to the gentiles in Acts supplements the mission to Israel.  (Powell 69)  This allows for what Jervell is arguing for, but does not limit it to the Jews.<br />Joseph Dworaknority view\\" (Powell 71), and it should stay that way.

Books	3	9	10	N	N	Sufficient	In Powell's work on the books of Acts he states his objective as:<br />\\"provide a non-technical survey for those who would like to know a little something about this subject [Acts] but have no intention of pursuing the matter further.  For others, I hope it will serve as a suitable introduction to the field, on that offers a general overview as well as some guidance on where to go next.\\" (Powell, 2)<br />That seemed like a reasonable objective to this reader.  On the other hand, Powell does not set the bar very high for himself as an author either.  Looking at the first part of his objective, I would argue he does a decent job of giving a broad based overview to the study of Acts.  He provides a general overview of the composition of Acts, a fairly thin section on the theology of Acts, further reading on the Eschatology and Ecclesiology of Acts, and reading Acts as History and Literature.  In each chapter Powell seems to do a good job of synthesizing relevant arguments of noted scholars, and draws some non-binding conclusions for each subject.<br /> At the end of the introduction Powell points out that there are some areas of disagreement in the study of Acts, but some wide ranges of agreement.  (Powell 19)  The areas of agreement originate from scholars almost unanimously agreeing the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts need to be read as one unit.  (Powell 19)  This is a pattern that emerges from the Powell work, laying out the areas of agreement, and then trying to find out what, if any, consensus is available.  While this is certainly not my style of writing, Powell sticks to his stated purpose and does not let on his own opinion on nearly any matter.  With an introductory text this seems to work well.<br /> In the second chapter of the book Powell repeats his pattern and again and lets his reader know what the arguments are regarding the writing of Acts, e.g. how much Luke actually wrote and how much he relied on sources.  (Powell 37)  This again underscores his stated purpose, if you want to know more he shows you where to go, if you think you have had enough, you at least know what the basic issues in the book of Acts.<br /> The third chapter deals with the theology of Acts.  This section could encompass hundreds of pages of Powell does an admirable job of defining the main issues, the Christology of Jesus, the role of the Holy Spirit, and God's part in Acts.  The conclusion of this chapter is by far the best work Powell does.  This is because he actually makes an argument and shows his cards.  He quotes Beverly Galenta as saying there are four methods for attaining a theology of Acts, and goes on to say \\"all these methods are problematic insofar as they neglect certain aspects of Acts while accenting others.\\" (Powell 57)  This is really the only point in which Powell varies from his pattern of being neutral on the issues of scholarship surrounding Acts.  The diversion is appreciated by this reader.  He quickly goes back to finding consensus and moves on to the next chapter.<br /> The next three sections deal with eschatology, ecclesiology and what happens if you read Acts as history or narrative.  These sections are fairly typical to the rest of the work.  Powell clearly lays out different perspectives on each issue, and tries to find consensus among the scholars studying Acts.  To this he succeeds because you do not get bogged down on any particular issue, and are left to draw your own conclusions or just move on.  The final conclusion of the book is weak.  Powell says, after studying the subject I am sure at great length, \\"future directions for scholarship are impossible to predict, but present trends can be noted.\\"  (Powell 109)  It seems to be a lack of courage on the part of the author not to predict future trends.  But, this is just my humble opinion.  Powell does accomplish what he set out to do, albeit in a very safe manner.tated purpose, if you want to know more he shows you where to go, if you think you have had enough, you at least know what the basic issues in the book of Acts.<BR> The third chapter deals with the theology of Acts.

He knows what he is good at, and works from there.  He could have flushed out what more about what leaders look like, how we can lead from the front or the back of the room, etc.  Still a good book regardless.<br />Stanley also focuses on knowing your inner \\"man\\" which seems to be a bit gender exclusive, but does not invalidate this as a good leadership text.

He then gets involved in some crazy plot twists, loses his wife, loses his career, and then becomes a thief.<br />Through all of this he ends up doing good in the end and helping the homeless and taking down the corporate interests who oppose him.  A good spin for Grisham off of his other books, and much better than, the Painted House.<br />Joseph Dworak	2003-11-04

The main characters, Jake and Brett spin you through their world of expatriate excess in post-WWI France and Spain.  Reading this book makes me want to travel Europe without a care in the world.  This seems to have some similarities to the themes touched on in a later work by Kerouac, 'On the Road.'  Although much more polite, this book is a great look into the 'lost generation' and how the cool crowd functioned in early 20th century Europe.  The descriptions of trout fishing and the bullfights in Spain are as vivid as any you will find.  This is a true masterpiece.<br />A<br />Joseph Dworak	2003-10-23

McManus once again challenges readers to think about their own lives and how they are living.  Using what he calls, &quot;The Character Matrix,&quot; he challenges us to go from self-focused slobs to servant-leaders.  McManus presents three streams in this journey, greed -&gt; generosity, foolishness -&gt; wisdom, and pride - &gt; courage.  Each stream will force you to reflect on what kind of life you are living, and whether you are inwardly or outwardly focused.<br />The key focus of Erwin's book revolves around the fact Jesus washed his disciples feet as he modeled servant-leadership to his followers.  McManus argues this model still applies today.  I agree.  Too many books on leadership talk nothing of character, McManus turns this on its ear.  His book is all about character and out of it you will be a better leader.<br />In having the privelege of seeing McManus practice what he preaches, this is a man who is a servant-leader.  Erwin pastors a church in Los Angeles called Mosaic, and serves his church well.  I cannot give this book a higher recommendation than 5 stars, but it really is a 10.

One, don't mess with a woman who is a good leader.  Two, always play your cards close to your vest.  Three, if you lead, truly lead, people will attack you and you need to be prepared.  Four, this was a very useful book.<br />I serve in a leadership/management role currently and much of this book applies univerally to any leadership situation.  I have read other books of this type, (Lincoln on Leadership), and have really enjoyed studying past leaders.  It also should push current leaders to see how it stacks up to now, and what we need to do better.<br />I recommend this book.  B<br />Joseph Dworak	2003-08-22

Lance is a competitor and it comes through loud and clear through his book.  I especially enjoyed reading about his training regimens and how much time he has to put in to win races.  The majority of this book however, focused on how Lance battled and beat Cancer.  I think Lance is very inspirational and causes everyone to not live like they have no tomorrow.

Faith Popcorn presents a valid argument that we as a society need to observe the trends that are driving our culture.  Some of the trends include, cocooning, clanning, icon-toppling among others.  These trends make sense and are backed up by anecdotal evidence gathered by the author's company.<br />Faith is a futurist marketer, trying to predict what will happen next, and what consumers will want.  There is some wiggle room, I believe, between the forces of what consumers want and what companies and culture demand that the consumer has to buy.  Faith leans more towards trends should drive companies, rather than companies driving trends.  Overall a useful book, but at this point some of the material is out of date, (note the 97 publishing date), but I am sure Faith is somewhere 'popping' some more ideas at her company, the 'brain reserve.'  One pick with this book is the concept of 'female think' &amp; 'mancipation.'  While there is some validity to what Faith is saying, why does the chapter on 'female think' get two chapters and all other trends (17) get just one?  Fair and Balanced?  Faith, you are successful, quit trying to prove it to the boys club, who cares what they think of you, you are doing a great job. Just some observations.  Grade of 'B'<br />Joseph Dworak	2003-06-20

The use of primary documents such as personal letters, journals, state proceedings, and other sources bring this work to life, and more importantly, John Adams to life.  Here is someone who carved his own path time and time again, most of the time on his own, sometimes in foreign countries, and always did what he thought was right.<br />If you want a great look at our second president, a man who is a titan of the revolution, you absolutely need to read this book.  Adams is portrayed in a balanced light, and that is not seen much in this era of revisionist history.  The author sticks with the story and represents Adams well two centuries later.  I highly recommend this book.  A+<br />Joseph Dworak	2003-06-14

Larry McMurtry has a drier than sand dust in the Sahara Desert sense of humor, but it is there and if you like sarcasm, you will dig this book.  Larry spends time on many highways and interstates and tells it like he sees it, I love the fact he is so honest in this work.  He talks about Missouri like it should be talked about, which is to not say much at all.  His comparisons of Minnesota cornfields and Key Largo are unique to him alone.<br />This book is a great travel companion, but it is not going to set the world on fire.  But, I do not think the author had that in mind when he wrote it anyway.

This book did not grab me like the aforementioned text, but it did a good job of laying out how important the Irish, and the monastic movement was to the culture and education of medieval Europe.  The time devoted to St. Patrick was very helpful, as there is so much myth associated with St. Patrick, it is nice to have a more accurate view of his contribution to Irish Christianity, and Christianity as a whole.

This book makes the time before, during and after the birth and death of Jesus Christ tangible to the reader of his work.  In this book Cahill sets up the cultural setting (important in any latent look at history) before Jesus Christ's birth, the time of the Roman Empire.  The time during Christ's life is described in a way that certainly gave me a different perspective on that time period.

This book begins with Gallup's common message, based on research, that if you focus on what you are good at; you will get better at it.  This book continues on showing you what makes up a these strengths, based on a combination of talents which cluster together and come out as things like Competition, Empathy, and Command.  This book will allow you to focus more on how you are wired, and what you have, than what you do not, and will never have.<br />Most importantly this book gives you access to your 'Top Five' strengths, or patterns for success.  These strengths, ranging from Harmony to Woo, will show you how you alone are as unique as 1 in 30 million people.  The book could have been 5 stars if Gallup would have provided more patterns of strength and how they work in sales careers, they only give you a few morsels from their vault of knowledge and what patterns and combinations of strengths work in sales.  They do let you in on the fact that Competition, Command and Empathy were themes commonly found in successful sales-agents.<br />Overall this book is an A-, another great work from Gallup based on research, not just theory.<br />Joseph Dworak	2003-03-11

I was racking my brain for the first half of the book trying to see how the plot worked, and how he was going to tie it all together at the end, well he did it, and very well.<br />The characters develop nicely, especially Preston Maddoc, the enraged sociopath-killer who reasons out why he is killing people, he comes across as kind of a sexy Jack Kevorkian, if there is such a thing.  The book is good work by Koontz, especially that he dealt with the issue of mercy-killing and how that can be twisted around with utilitarian ethics.

I soon realized this purely speculative rendition of the end times was mildly entertaining, but that was about it.  I think this book, and the following editions amount to interesting books about the same level of writing as stories about gunfighters in the old west.  The very fact that Lahaye is profiting off his version of the book of Revelation is slightly alarming, but this is the USA, and he can do, as he pleases.<br />With all that said, this book was mildly entertaining, but purely speculative in nature.

Pinsky offers up a great range of information which helps any Simpson's fan or layman understand the &quot;theology of the Simpsons&quot; better.  This book is funny, insightful, and a good read.  There is a slight drawback due to the fact Pinsky spends a lot of time quoting from unpublished Masters Theses from scholars that you have no idea what their point of view is.  With that said, this book is still worth reading, and will provide entertainment for the educated Simpson's viewer.  I did appreciate the fact Pinsky does a very objective job in reporting what he found through careful study of a mountain of material regarding the show.  Of help would have been more interaction with the writers from the show directly with Pinsky, as opposed to secondary and tertiary sources.  Overall Grade B<br />Joseph Dworak	2002-12-16

Too much time has been spent in the past 10 years bashing the founding fathers, and this book provides a far more balanced approach to the time period, and their accomplishments.  The analysis of the the brains, and hearts of these founding brothers is done with skill by Ellis, and that is what history is about, figuring out what happened with whatever evidence is available at the time.  For those who would dwell on the controversy surrounding Ellis, I would say, the work is still good regardless of the man and his ethics.

This book does a good job of weaving together U2's thoughts on God, their lyrics, and how their music developed.  A pick I have with this book is the author projects his interpretations on U2's music not always with the back up of Bono, or one of the band seconding what he is saying.  I would be interested to know what Bono thinks about this book, and if it portrays him accurately.  I think it probably comes close, and Stockman did a pretty good job of researching this work.  Evangelicals do need to wake up and realize their are believers out there who go about their lives affecting people much differently than preaching or attending church on Sunday.  Bono is a positive force for the kingdom, and this book ties that all together pretty well.  B+<br />Joseph Dworak	2002-11-28

I was happy I did.  Jack Keroac really did hit on something between the hippies and the &quot;greatest generation,&quot; the beat generation.  This novel harkens back to a simpler time of crossing the country with other travelers when it was relatively safe to do so.  Being someone who always enjoys the road trip, this book resonated with me personally and spiritually.  Personally I understand Sal Paradise's need to be on the road free from worry or cares.  Harder to understand is the beat-mystic Dean Moriaty.  Dean is the tragic hero of the story, who really never becomes heroic, and only ulitmately lets Sal down.  I think Dean is identifiable to many because there is always someone who will fail you if you put your trust in them without looking at their character.<br />This book makes you look at many issues, relationships, youth, travel, the universe, being all you can be and much more.  It is worth the read no matter what Generation you are from.  Is it just me or was the beat generation a lot like Gen X?<br />Food for thought.<br />Joseph Dworak	2002-11-12

In his first book, &quot;An Unstoppable Force,&quot; McManus challenged believers and churches alike to stop trying to catch up and start creating.  Much like his first book, this book is a call to Christ-followers to wake up and start taking charge of their lives, never letting a &quot;divine moment,&quot; pass you by.  One great part about this book is that McManus practices what he preaches, this is a man who lives his life serving others and God continues to use him in powerful ways.<br />If you read this book, you cannot help but be challenged by McManus' call to seizing your moment.  He carefully weaves the story of Jonathan and his armor-bearer to show how Jonathan seized his moment, and won a mighty victory for Israel, while King Saul slept.<br />If you have not read anything by McManus, buy this book, but also read his other work &quot;An Unstoppable Force.&quot;  This book delivers on many fronts, but most of all to challenge individual believers to take risks for the invisible kingdom of God.  Do not read this book if you do not want to be challenged out of your pants.  This book is solid, and cutting edge, unlike many &quot;Christian Books&quot; out there, you are missing out if you do not check this out.  I personally cannot wait until McManus publishes his next work.  But in the mean time, do not miss out on what McManus has to say in this soul-penetrating manuscript.<br />Joseph Dworak	2002-11-09

The author attempts to start the work giving a perspective of what the world, Europe and specifically Germany were like during the life of Martin Luther prior to the reformation, and at some points, during the reformation period.  After the author weaves through the complex circumstances between the Papacy and the governing officials throughout Christendom, he attempts to place Luther at the start of his educational career.  As Luther moves from his bachelor's program, he moves to a Masters degree.  Significant events in Luther's life move him to join a monastery of the Augustinian order.  Throughout this time Luther begins to understand his own problems with the sale of indulgences and how he can possibly, if ever, achieve salvation.<br /> During his time in the monastery Luther visits Rome, and is dismayed at the state of affairs with the Holy City, the author argues that this was not the quintessential turning point in Luther's life and railings against the church, but clearly had an impact and helped move Luther towards his forthcoming condemnations.  Luther eventually pins his ninety five theses to the door in Wittenberg, and incites debate on many fronts.  Luther is subsequently dismissed from the monastery, the church, and eventually the empire.  The author then focuses on the repercussions of Luther's theology on the Church, and other reformers and movements such as Erasmus, with whom Luther broke ranks, and the Anabaptists along with others.  Luther spends the rest of his life studying scripture and refining his concepts of, sola scriptura, sola gratia, and sola fide.  (Scripture alone, Grace alone, by faith)  He held fervently to these beliefs in the face of criticism from the Church, and other reformers.  Luther did theology with his heart as much as with his mind, and would not waver from the fine line he walked his whole theological career.<br />Main Point<br /> The main point of the work is found early on in this work by Oberman.

There are many typed of documents represented from Augustine to more modern documents on Jesuits.  I appreciate the fact they do some limited notes for you to help you understand dates, but otherwise leave you to figure out for yourself what these documents mean, and if they are valid or not.

There are so many stories that saturate our folk history of the Old West, it is hard to know what is true and what is legend.  This book systematically takes a look at what is true and what is bogus, and what is grey in the areas of many old legends from the Old West.<br />My Dad made our family stop at every historical marker in the entire West, well at least that is what it felt like, but in doing this he instilled in me an interest in the West and how it was won, etc.  This book gave me a fun, entertaining look at what is true and what is not true, I would recommend it for enjoyable reading.	2002-10-23

This book helped me in understanding how evolution came about, and where Darwin was coming from.  She takes abstract concepts of atoms and the speed of light, and breaks them down into something the lay reader can understand.  This book gives a solid, biblical, yet well-informed view of science today.  While it is not a page-turning Dean Koontz thriller, it is a good solid read.  4 stars.<br />Joseph Dworak	2002-10-23

Stop trying to find out what you are not, and start finding out what you are!  Most people who want to take the test over and over again do so to validate what they think they are, and not how they were created.  This test is meant to be taken once, in order to measure your instinctive responses to the questions, not your thought out answers.  Unlike other psychometric tests, the StrengthsFinder tells you how you respond, your initial reactions, how you are.<br />I work with this tool on a daily basis and have seen over 500 results of this test and done many one on one interviews to follow up and help people go deeper in their strengths.  9 out of 10 people are amazed with the results and how accurate this test is.  Most of the 10% who have questions can figure it out and be happy with some counseling and deeper discovery of their strengths.<br />The [money] is worth the price to take the test, and the book does an adequate job of going deeper with your strengths.

This book was a welcome respite from the management and corporate lingo I normally have to suffer through.  This book reads like a fine wine goes down, soft and smooth.  Hemingway will just come out of nowhere and you think you are reading the greatest paragraph ever written.  When thinking about issues such as should we go to war or not, this book deals with the pros and cons and the human toll war places on all participants.  The love story between Catherine and the Lieutenant is a classic, but more so is the writing about the War.<br />This book is a classic and can be read in one night, it is just that good.  Hemingway is so simple, yet, deep, not many writers can even come close to achieving what he does in this book.  I look forward to reading another Hemingway novel.	2002-10-21

I have shared this book with numerous people, and I have never had a bad response to the message it puts forth.<br />We must learn how to show grace to each other. If you read the story of the father who is waiting for his runaway teenage prostitute daughter and do not cry, you are living in an alternate reality.

Bravo, Phillip! Christian authors continually bombard us with ways to live a better life, three easy steps, or prayers, and here is Phillip Yancey telling us that the stages of development in a life as a follower of Christ get more difficult as you mature to the point where God will leave you on your own to help your faith grow.<br />I read this book during a time of immense personal trial. This book taught me to have ambidextrous faith, able to take the good with the bad, equally. I cannot say that I have mastered this concept, or if I ever will, but thanks again to the author for challenging me to do so.<br />Yancey never gives &quot;easy answers.&quot;  That is why he is so good.  In an era where postmoderns are not satisfied with &quot;easy answers,&quot; Yancey is forcing anyone who reads his books, if they are honest, to ask tough questions and journey towards an answer, rarely do you see authors do this with as much skill as Yancey.<br />I look forward to the next book by Yancey, it is always a good and challenging read for anyone.	2002-10-10

Doug Fields has done a ton for youth ministry during the past decade and he deserves to be applauded for his dedication, and development of students and leaders in Southern California and across the country.  This book is a modern approach to youth ministry, yet it still helps define where people are at in your youth ministry, whether they are in the crowd, the committed, etc.<br />I think the best thing about this book is the fact that Doug picked students to spend time with and invest, and that is youth minstry.  Setting up programs that everyone can be involved with, but more importantly, having leaders mentor 3-5 students at a time and really make a personal impact on their lives.  Doug worked with a core group, and that is key, no matter where you are or who you are working with.  You have to \\"go with the goers\\" and Doug works that out in this book.<br />This book is a good record of what Doug has done at Saddleback, and is a nice look at 90's youth ministry from a modern perspective.	2002-10-05

Tony is a tremendous teacher, and yet very humble with the knowledge he has gained over years of youth ministry experience.<br />I recommend this book to followers of Christ both young and old, especially those who are trying to figure out what in the world is postmodernism.<br />One warning, don't come to this book for a guide of how to do youth ministry, Tony won't give it to you.  What Tony will give you is the knowledge and the tools to figure out what to do in your area and with your students.  This is a solid book.	2002-10-05

Bonhoeffer opens his work with the call of Levi, who was called and followed without hesitation. The author points out to us this call is not a mental decision, it is rather just a decision under the authority of Jesus Christ.<br />This call from Christ, and the subsequent following of Levi, comes with no praise for obedience. The author shows us that there is only obedience, without the expectation of praise for simply doing what we are all created to do; follow Christ. Levi follows simply for the sake of the call, not for what he might get out of following Christ. Bonhoeffer would have us believe this is the ultimate model for us to use in choosing to follow Christ. Through this call, there is significance, but only in Christ, who is the only significance, he alone is important. (Bonhoeffer, 59)<br />It is here that he turns to looking at what is not true discipleship, which included having an abstract Christology, religious knowledge and theological knowledge. If it is an abstract idea, it is not real discipleship. He hammers home this point in saying, &quot;Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Christianity without discipleship.&quot; (59) This kind of religion talks about God, but not his living and transformational son Jesus Christ.<br />The next part of his essay turns to comparing three disciples and how they reacted to Christ's call. The first, who we already have touched on did not hesitate and followed Christ immediately. The author says that the disciple did not call himself to this chosen destiny, rather Christ alone can call. Our decision lies in whether we follow or not. The second disciple asks Jesus if he can bury his father before he follows him. (60) Although this was the law at the time, Jesus, who is superior to the law let the man fulfill the ordinance in order that he could then follow Christ. Bonhoeffer shows us now that Christ made himself at that point an opponent of the law, above the law, and the only law that matters. (61)<br />The third disciple has his own ideas about what it will look like to follow Christ. This, the author says, is inconsistent because it renders Christ's call into human terms, which it is not. This puts Christ into a box, and, if it worked that way, would let us determine what our path in life would be. Bonhoeffer acknowledges that this is possible, but would not be the true call Christ has for our life. As soon as this disciple expresses his willingness to follow, he does not really want to follow at all. (61)<br />The author then goes into what exactly this call looks like. First and foremost is that the call will change the person's life dramatically. They must leave their old situation. This call must be heard and than acted upon. He says, &quot;The road to faith passes through obedience to the call of Jesus.&quot; (63) He continues on commanding us that Jesus' call is the only thing that makes faith possible. Only the call is important, and this call leads us to faith. He also shows us that faith and obedience are separate but there is a unity between these two in the call to follow Christ.<br />This is where he reiterates that the first step hearing the call and following is the most important piece. Jesus wants us to show him we will follow, not talk about it. It is in this obedience that we show our faith. Bonhoeffer than attempts to show us that if we are trying to keep some part of our life under our own control, we are being disobedient.<br />This document finishes with the author's treatise on the rich young man who came to Christ and asked what he needed to do to have eternal life. Christ knew this about the young man and told him to leave everything and follow him. The young man was presented with this and could not, and went away sad. Bonhoeffer shows us how Christ creates a situation where there can be &quot;no retreat.&quot; (75) This man was confronted with the eternal Son of God, and walked away.<br />Bonhoeffer is completely convincing in his call to discipleship. There is hardly any way one can argue with what he has to say about the life of Christ and what Christ is calling us to do. He backs this up with sound doctrine, using the example of three disciples and how they did or did not follow Jesus' call. The author shows what each man had to do to follow Christ, the perfect example being Levi who just simply hear the call, and went. The interesting disciple is the third disciple who wanted to map out his own course for living, and in that he had lost his way. The author was strong here in showing that we must follow Christ and not set any stipulations along the way. It is all or nothing in Bonhoeffer's view, which he convinces this reader is completely accurate.<br />There is no lack of clarity in the statement; &quot;The road to faith passes through obedience to the call of Jesus.&quot; (63) How can anyone ever learn what true faith is unless we are under the will of God for our lives. Bonhoeffer reinforces my view that unless Christ is transforming us through following his call, our faith is empty and really no faith at all.<br />I highly recommend this work, prepare to be challenged when you read it.uation where there can be &quot;no retreat.&quot; (75) This man was confronted with the eternal Son of God, and walked away.<br />Bonhoeffer is completely convincing in his call to discipleship.

I currently work in the field of Leadership Identification and Development and this test time and time again shows students and young adults ages 18-30, a new way to approach life.<br />If there is a weakness in this book, it is that is does not go deeper. Clifton does a great job showing how he and others developed this process over years and years of study. Personally I want to be compared against the best, and this is what the book and test do. Have you ever wondered why you always size yourself up against everyone else and if you knew you could not win you did not even play? --Competition. <br />The beauty of this book is that your personal combination of strengths can put you as unique as 1 in millions, and the chances of meeting someone that is your exact double is next to impossible. How great is it that we are all so unique? Does not lend much credence to the theory that we are all here by some cosmic accident. <br />Our society, educational systems, businesses, and so many other institutions always try to build us up where we are weak. I worked at a company in Washington, DC and was utilized as an office manager and executive assistant, a job I was clearly not wired to do. With the the themes of competition, achiever, activator and significance, how could I ever handle ordering pens and pencils and organizing a contact database? I could not! I want to change the world, and now I know why-- I was wired to do it. <br />Do you know instantly how peopleare feeling when you walk in a room? I cannot, and I know my emphathy is low or non-existent. My dreams of becoming a counselor were misguided at best. This book, and the test will help you find out how you are wired and what a perfect job for you would be.<br />Can you wake up and say, I am doing what I was created to do and enjoying it?

I was instantly drawn into the story of the old man, and his fishing boat, and his struggle against a worthy adversary, a once in a lifetime fish.  The crux of the story relies on this lonely, small, withered old man, using the last power and energy he has in his tired frame to catch one last fish.  This fish happens to be the biggest fish he has ever seen.  The fight goes on day and night until the old man finally lands the fish, but it is so large he cannot put it in the boat and has to drag it behind him.  Once he sails his boat back to warmer waters, the sharks set in, and he tries to fend them off with an oar.  All the time the catch of his lifetime, the end to his streak of much time without catching any fish, is dragging behind being torn apart by these atangonistic sharks.  The outcome, you will have to read for yourself, but this book is a classic, and worth reading.  Once you start to read it, you will not be able to put it down.	2002-07-23

One thing I found that was very helpful was in the last two pages, Hogan talks about course management, and tricks to saving shots when you are playing in all types of conditions.  This was a very informative and useful section of the book.<br />There are many golf-instruction books out there, and this book stands the test of time, as did Hogan's golf game.  I recommend it to any golfer.	2002-07-23
US	52096512	R39D2SBGLKY78K	0310228344	64463183	The Bible Jesus Read	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Good Yancey	Once again Philip Yancey did an excellent job looking at the bible, and theology from a reporter's perspective, giving life to the Old Testament, the &quot;Bible Jesus Read.&quot;  This book really gave me a renewed interest into the Old Testament, and why it is so vital for any person interested in Christianity to read.  Yancey explains how he struggled with the Old Testament when he was younger, and how he re-gained an interest in it once again.  Right along with the author I discovered a new interest in the OT, and it really helped me at a time when I was going through the entire bible in six months.  Sometimes when you read through the OT, it can get a bit dry, but Yancey, through this work, can inspire you, as he did me, to have an interest in what Jesus studied as a child, the Old Testament.	2002-07-23

Lewis gives his version of what hell, demons, temptation, life, humans, God, look like from a demon's perspective.  This book really shifts the paradigm of why things happen, to more, who or what causes these things to happen.  The author does a masterful job of looking at human's and how they struggle through life, conversion experiences, change, success, failure and a wide range of human emotions.<br />The thing that sets the Screwtape letters apart is the format of how Lewis accomplishes his task.  He sets this book up as a series of letters from an mentor to a mentee, and it is all focused around one human who the mentee is trying to tempt and lead down the wrong path.  The mentor does his best to show the mentee how humans can be tripped up.<br />This book is good for a wide audience, from skeptics to believers, from Christians to Hindus.  It looks at the human spirit, and how God created us to function, and how we can easily screw it up.  I highly recommend this work if you want an intellectual challenge and a clever read.	2002-07-23
US	52096512	R1ZOI1I62OXWWH	1558538674	835796389	Hogan	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Solid	This book really only confirmed what I had thought for a long time, behind Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan was a tremendous golfer who was way ahead of his time.  Hogan nearly won the grand slam, and could not compete in the PGA because of the fact it started almost the same time the British Open was finishing.  As we all watch Tiger Woods try for the grand slam, let us not forget Ben Hogan who was as close as anyone has ever come to doing it.  The most amazing part of Hogan's story was the fact he won the US Open after almost dying in a car crash.<br />Sampson does a nice job with this book, telling about Hogan like he was, stearn and driven, and definitely not writing a fluff piece like some biographies can be.  Hogan was tough, and I would equate him as the \\"Ted Williams\\" of golf, so good it was hard for him to teach anyone because he set such high standards for himself.  I recommend this book to golfers and people who want to read about a remarkable man.	2002-07-19

John does a commendable job of letting the reader know what it is like to experience life on the PGA tour.  This includes players who were stars, to players who are just trying to make it.  I read through this book twice, and enjoyed it as much the second time through.<br />Some of the memorable moments from the book are just seeing how hard it is to be a top-rated golfer, and even make it on the tour.  These golfers are the top 1% of 1% of all golfers in the world and it shows.  Feinstein does not spare-anyone from his writers knife, this is a good book.	2002-07-19

In an age of technical, computer, look-alike golf swings, Harvey Penick wrote a book that the common man can understand.<br />I have used the thoughts and tips from Harvey's book for over five years now, and it has done nothing but help me become a better golfer, and student of the game.  Harvey's tips are great not only for amateurs, but are used by professionals as well.  This book is the bible of golf books, a starting point for anyone interested in the game, or interested in getting better.<br />I know people who read this book every year getting ready for the golf season, and it does nothing but help them with their game.  Some of the best parts of this book are when Harvey shares anecdotes from his life, which are always filled with humor and applicable to the golf world, and life.<br />Harvey Penick was a mad who had integrity, and that is why his legacy lives on.  This book is highly recommended to golfers, and non-golfers who might just catch the golf bug after reading this book.	2002-07-18

Not only does it combine the pleasure of a road-trip with wild and wacky characters, it is just plain funny.  With the author and an old man traveling across the country on a perplexing journey to return the brain of Albert Einstein, it really had me rolling at some points during the book.<br />The scene I only wish I could have been there for:  The author and the old man are in a school showing off Einstein's brain to a group of middle-schoolers, and the kids begin asking out-there questions.  If you were there, it must have been like a weird dream after eating too much pasta and wine.<br />I would recommend this book for a long drive or an airplane ride where you have 4-5 hours to plow through this addictive book.  There is really nothing like this that has ever been written, who would think to write about who had Eintein's brain?  Definitely worth reading!	2002-07-18

Packer.  This book does not dissapoint, and really transcends generations with a clear picture of evangelical theology, and for those who believe, God.  Packer carefully makes his way through all aspects of the divine, and makes a strong argument for why to believe, and what God is really like.  It would be interesting to give this book out as a tool to introduce someone who did not believe in God, to the whole concept.<br />Packer is a humble man, after hearing him speak a few years ago, I know his heart is in a great place.  This book does put a strong emphasis on pre-destination, and if that is not up your alley it may rub you the wrong way.  Overall this is a classic theological book for the 20th century, one that will be remembered long into the future.	2002-07-17

What he believes comes through strongly in this work, and is very authentic.  Sweet articulates better than any I have seen what is going on in the world today and how the church does, and a lot of times, does not relate to it.  I devoured this book and fresh look at theology from someone who is not afraid to push the envelope.  While many authors in the Christian world rehash the same theories and patterns and ways to be a better Christian, Sweet challenges all of us to get with the times or be irrelevant.  I would love to be able to take a class from Sweet someday, and really pick his brain on where he is at.  If you enjoyed this book, you would enjoy the Erwin McManus book, &quot;An Unstoppable Force.&quot;	2002-07-17

I read this book a few years ago, and was both interested in Willie Mays not only as a player, but as a man.  Growing up a baseball player Willie Mays was someone to idolize, and with the way he played, this was easy to do.  What was most sad about this book was the fact that Willie ended up a great career having little money to show for it, and had to become a greeter at a casino to make ends meet.  One can only imagine how much money he would command now, and how he would be set for life in today's current baseball climate.  If A-Rod gets $25 million a year, than Willie would get much more.  This book gets points for being an honest look at Willie's life, from his own perspective, and for that I aplaud him.  If you like baseball, you will like this book.	2002-07-17

While this is not an in-depth study of what to do with ever nuance employees may have, this book points out obvious things managers can do to get more productivity out of their employees.  This book also works for employees, it can help people better understand why they do what they do at work.<br />In the same genre of \\"First Break All The Rules,\\" by Marcus Buckingham, this book pounds away at the fact that we are all different, and the more we know about ourselves, and our managers know about us, the happier, and most importantly, more effective everyone will be.	2002-07-17

MacKenzie strives to show how he made it in a large company that was weighed down by rules and procedures, &quot;The Giant Hairball.&quot;  This was very interesting because anyone who has worked in a big institution, whether corporate or educational, knows full well how it is easy to become weighed down trying to figure out how to do something by following insitutional policies, than actually completing the task you are setting out to do.<br />Mackenzie offers a comical, yet insightful view of how to make it in a big corporation or any large organization.  I would say those who see the world as black and white might want to pass this book by, but those who are willing to take a chance to make a difference, and realize the procedures to send out a fax are not what makes or break an organization.  This book is the anti-office space theory of corporations.<br />All in all, an excellent and light view of how to live and thrive in a big place you might call your job!	2002-07-15

God loves us, no matter what we do, or do not do.  Brennan hammers this theme home in many of his books, and this book is no exception.  This book made the trip with me to LA from Minneapolis and was a quick read that required a lot of contemplation after the reading was done.  Do I have a ruthless trust in God?  Will I let God into my life fully?  These are questions Brennan demands that we ask.<br />This book is a great part of any spiritual journey.

The folks at Gallup are conistently ahead of the curve with their research and practices on leadership.  The interesting thing about this book is it shows how people managed by being leaders, and not just managers.  Also, it shows how you can manage better if you do not put one standard on every employee, and that you must cater to different personality types to achieve maximum performance from your employees.  This is a great book for novice managers, or seasoned pros.  I would highly recommend taking the time to read it.	2002-06-05

He is the epitomy of someone who did it his way, and this book very clearly lays out how his career took off and how he bucked the system and ended up in charge of it.  Although this book is a bit self-agrandizing, I did learn a lot of leadership lessons none the less.  Thanks to Jack Welch for putting his story out there and doing more than just listing his accomplishments, which are many.  Welch challenges anyone in management or leadership to focus on people's strengths, and not what they are weak at.  This is a concept that not many companies get.  Welch did get it, and GE went farther than it ever went before under his leadership.  A good read, but be prepared for all the Jack you can handle.	2001-12-21

Erwin McManus leads a church in Los Angeles that is unlike any church I have ever encountered.  This book goes through much of the foundational patterns of the church, Mosaic, and Erwin's personal vision for church in the 21st Century.  The work begins with some of the things that have gone wrong with church in the modern era.  The author mentions that church is treated as an organization instead of a living organism.  He argues that church must be treated as a living organism to awaken an apostolic ethos, which unleashed the movement of God.  I can say with great certainty that not too many churches are thinking this way.  Every church that I involved myself with, whether as a volunteer, or paid ministry professional, treated church as a business for God.  Business systems are fine for the business world, but what the author argues for is that church be treated as a living organism, a species, that must adapt and change to remain culturally relevant.  He argues that when church is a living organism, its members will reproduce new believers, small groups will reproduce communities of faith, and the church will unleash the apostolic movement of God.<br /> The author next moves us towards how the church has become stagnant.  He rails us to not be stuck in a safe theology, rather for us to move towards engaging what Christ envisioned as a dangerous faith.  One of the more interesting pieces of this work is when the author notes that the only storm that can sink a church is the storm that rages from within.  From my own experience, joining a church after it had split over a small issue, this rings completely true and close to home.  How many times have churches split over issues ranging from what color the carpet will be to what to do with the missions' budget for the following year.  It seems to me that God is looking down upon us and grabbing his hair in frustration.<br /> This book became even more important to me personally in wake of the recent tragedies in New York City and Washington, D.C.  The author informs us that Globalization and a mass urbanization is taking place all around us whether we like it or not, and churches need to do something to handle this new change, risk extinction.  Time and time again I see churches near the city whose neighborhoods have changed, and they have done nothing about it.  The so-called transitional communities, change, and become ethnically diverse, and the original church members move to the newer suburbs, and there is no shift in what the church looks like.  The new people in the neighborhood have no place to attend worship; they simply are not going to attend a church where they are not represented in leadership.  The author commands us to change, to be a living organism as a church, to move past being purpose driven, and being alive.  Many church models over the past two decades focus on get the new people in, train them up, and send them out.  This model was fine in a more ethnically stagnant climate which we dwelt in during the modern era.  What the author commands us to do is to move back to the past, so we can see the future.<br /> Other authors, such as Robert Webber, and Leonard Sweet echo what Erwin calls us to do, have a radical new vision for church in the postmodern era.  To emulate the apostles and how 12 men and their followers changed the face of the world.  The author challenges us to find, or to ourselves be catalytic leaders who are not afraid to move fast and move others quickly with us.  While not everyone will be a catalytic movement leader, when the church or body of believers finds a catalytic movement leader, let us not snuff them out.  To many times churches that refuse to change, whose feet are stuck in spiritual cement, refuse to identify, and then develop leaders who will awaken the church from the slumber of decline.  This needs to change.  While this author's work definitely does not provide a ten step plan to improve your church, he does more.  Erwin McManus calls us to reexamine everything about how we do church.  If we hope to survive and thrive in an era where Islam in the fastest growing religion in the United States, we all should take heed to what Erwin is saying to us in the important work.rovide a ten step plan to improve your church, he does more.

This book was a great example of how he can take a subject that has been looked at from so many angles, the life of Christ, and put a new and interesting spin on it for the reader.  This book, although reaching at times, really makes you feel as if you were walking through Jerusalem as one of Jesus' disciples.  What was he really like?  How was he to be around?  What did he care about?  What did he mean when he said...  Philip Yancey inspires the reader to read his book, and then dig deeper into the life of Christ.<br />I can see why his books easily win awards for best Christian book of the year, year after year.  There are not many Christian authors who will take the risks that he does, to tell it like it really is.  The world needs authenticity, and Phillip Yancey delivers that time and time again.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be challenged about their relationship with Christ, or just to find out more about what Christ was like here on earth while he was alive.	2001-07-18

Willow Creek does many great things for the Kingdom of God, this book is not the best work they have ever published.  While well intentioned, this book does a good job of presenting a model that would take most modern churches years to see implement.<br />I know of a few examples of Churches who implemented this model and met it with limited success, and others who thrived on using this model.<br />What I really appreciated about this work was how the author took ideas from many churches and incorporated them into his work.  This was a very strong component of this book.  Take for example, Mosaic Church in Los Angeles, the church that is 50 years ahead of everyone else, how they do a night where any questions can be asked, and how that particular service is held in a nightclub in Los Angeles.  Thanks again to the author for incorporating many other models and programs into this book.<br />This book is a great resource for many ideas.  It delivers well on that front.	2001-07-15

Finally I found an author, Leonard Sweet, who is clearly right on in his approach to living a Godly life.  Where else can you find out better how God wants us to live, and really enjoy life without the guilt that is laid on us by many modern churches.  Sweet delivers an excellent book on how followers of Christ should live in this new postmodern era.  He is a postmodern author who speaks in a language that is easy to follow, at least for me.  I think anyone who picks this book up will have a new perspective on life that will leave you wanting more.<br />Leonard Sweet puts Christianity on the cutting edge by taking us back an ancient faith movement.  I had a professor in college who was agnostic, and he made the point to me that the best examples of human beings he had ever encountered in his studies were first century Christians.  Leonard Sweet prods us to move back to the past, and live as the first followers of Christ lived.<br />In essence, we need to move back to the past.  I could not agree more with Sweet on this point.  But his book is much more than Theology, it is a fun look at how to live life in a Godly way and really enjoy yourself while you are doing it.<br />This book is great for anyone who wants to get a peek into what, I believe, God has in store for us in this life, and the life to come in heaven.  Sweet tells us to &quot;Dance the Salsa,&quot;  I second that emotion.	2001-07-15

I took the StrengthsFinder test earlier this year, and I have looked at life differently ever since.  Donald Clifton has spent twenty years monitoring and discovering patterns of strength in the best of the best.<br />Whether you have achiever, context, futuristic, emphathy, restorative, or whatever, this book and test is going to dramatically change the way you look at the world.  I currently work in the field of Leadership Identification and Development and this test time and time again shows students and young adults ages 18-30, a new way to approach life.<br />I always wondered why I had, without trying, met over 200 famous people in my life, and always wanted them to remember me, the strength significance played out in my life.  If you are a business or educational institution this book and test can radically alter how you select employees, leaders, and how you can communicate more effectively with existing employees. <br />If there is a weakness in this book, it is that is does not go deeper.  Clifton does a great job showing how he and others developed this process over years and years of study.  Personally I want to be compared against the best, and this is what the book and test do.  Have you ever wondered why you always size yourself up against everyone else and if you knew you could not win you did not even play? --Competition.  <br />The beauty of this book is that your personal combination of strengths can put you as unique as 1 in millions, and the chances of meeting someone that is your exact double is next to impossible.  How great is it that we are all so unique?  Does not lend much credence to the theory that we are all here by some cosmic accident.  <br />Our society, educational systems, businesses, and so many other institutions always try to build us up where we are weak.  I worked at a company in Washington, DC and was utilized as an office manager and executive assistant, a job I was clearly not wired to do.  With the the themes of competition, achiever, activator and significance, how could I ever handle ordering pens and pencils and organizing a contact database?  I could not!  I want to change the world, and now I know why-- I was wired to do it.  <br />Do you know instantly how people are feeling when you walk in a room?  I cannot, and I know my emphathy is low or non-existent.  My dreams of becoming a counselor were misguided at best.  This book, and the test will help you find out how you are wired and what a perfect job for you would be.<br />Can you wake up and say, I am doing what I was created to do and enjoying it?  If not, I suggest you read this book and meditate over the information you receive back from it.  <br />Thanks to Donald Clifton for an excellent and cutting edge work.	2001-07-08

This book will touch you to your core being, your soul, and your heart.  I found myself so into reading this book, I could not put it down.  Yancey is incredibly adept at showing how much love Christ has for all of his followers, and all of humanity.  I have shared this book with numerous people, and I have never had a bad response to the message it puts forth.  <br />We must learn how to show grace to each other.  If you read the story of the father who is waiting for his runaway teenage prostitute daughter and do not cry, you are living in an alternate reality.  This book was very challenging, and not afraid to tackle the issues of homosexuality and other tough issues that Christianity, especially evangelical Christianity, refuse to deal with.  <br />Thanks again to the author for an incredible book.  I will read it again and enjoy it more, like a fine wine, Yancey gets better with age.	2001-06-02

Brennan Manning has once again woven together his words in a way that will not leave you without a lot of questions.  Brennan shares once again his incredible stories of personal trial and reaching for a God who does not always seem to be close.  This book really challenged me to evaluate where I was with my faith, and who I was really trusting, God, or myself and my abilities.  <br />Brennan has a simple yet brilliant concept that has been echoed over and over again throughout the centuries, God loves us, and there is nothing we can do about it.  Manning calls us to go past faith into Ruthless Trust, this, I don't think will be easy to do, but we are commanded to try none the less.<br />Thanks to Brennan for his challenge and continued dealing with the tough issues of Christianity.  Issues that many other authors do not, or choose not to deal with.  <br />This is a good read, I guarantee it.	2001-06-02

I read this book again when I was in high school, and again I was really scared.  I have seen the movie a few times and each time I am scared to my wits end.  I only recently found out that this story is probably not true, and that is a bit sad, and probably why this book is now out of print.  But if you read it for what it is, a scarey book, it is a great page turner that will have you caught up in a world of nightmares and dreamscapes.	2001-06-02

This model, which worked extremely well in Southern California, is a good model for, Southern California.  Warren is quick to point out that churches have to adapt this model to fit their settings, and this, I agree is very key.  This book had a feel of modernity to it, while we are living in a postmodern world.  I congratulate Rick Warren for what he has done in Southern California, and in his book.  Rick's personal story is very inspiring, more so than any model he presents.  Rick shows how following the call of God can lead to great things.  The particularly poignant story of how he met a famous pastor from Dallas who prayed for him and told him he had big things to do as a Pastor is a great testimony towards how God works in this world.  Thanks Rick for sharing your story.	2001-06-02

Bravo, Phillip!  Christian authors continually bombard us with ways to live a better life, three easy steps, or prayers, and here is Phillip Yancey telling us that the stages of development in a life as a follower of Christ get more difficult as you mature to the point where God will leave you on your own to help your faith grow.  <br />I read this book during a time of immense personal trial.  This book taught me to have ambidextrous faith, able to take the good with the bad, equally.   I cannot say that I have mastered this concept, or if I ever will, but thanks again to the author for challenging me to do so.<br />I look forward to the next book by Yancey, it is always a good and challenging read for anyone.	2001-06-02
US	52096512	RSPM1V9G8EE3A	0684815001	49268871	The Cost of Discipleship	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A call that cannot be ignored.	Dietrich Bonhoeffer in his classic treatise on the first step in truly following Christ gives anyone who reads this work very little wiggle room to deny what he is saying. Bonhoeffer opens his work with the call of Levi, who was called and followed without hesitation. The author points out to us this call is not a mental decision, it is rather just a decision under the authority of Jesus Christ. <br />This call from Christ, and the subsequent following of Levi, comes with no praise for obedience. The author shows us that there is only obedience, without the expectation of praise for simply doing what we are all created to do; follow Christ. Levi follows simply for the sake of the call, not for what he might get out of following Christ. Bonhoeffer would have us believe this is the ultimate model for us to use in choosing to follow Christ. Through this call, there is significance, but only in Christ, who is the only significance, he alone is important. (Bonhoeffer, 59)<br />It is here that he turns to looking at what is not true discipleship, which included having an abstract Christology, religious knowledge and theological knowledge. If it is an abstract idea, it is not real discipleship. He hammers home this point in saying, \\"Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Christianity without discipleship.\\" (59) This kind of religion talks about God, but not his living and transformational son Jesus Christ. <br />The next part of his essay turns to comparing three disciples and how they reacted to Christ's call. The first, who we already have touched on did not hesitate and followed Christ immediately. The author says that the disciple did not call himself to this chosen destiny, rather Christ alone can call. Our decision lies in whether we follow or not. The second disciple asks Jesus if he can bury his father before he follows him. (60) Although this was the law at the time, Jesus, who is superior to the law let the man fulfill the ordinance in order that hecould then follow Christ. Bonhoeffer shows us now that Christ made himself at that point an opponent of the law, above the law, and the only law that matters. (61) <br />The third disciple has his own ideas about what it will look like to follow Christ. This, the author says, is inconsistent because it renders Christ's call into human terms, which it is not. This puts Christ into a box, and, if it worked that way, would let us determine what our path in life would be. Bonhoeffer acknowledges that this is possible, but would not be the true call Christ has for our life. As soon as this disciple expresses his willingness to follow, he does not really want to follow at all. (61) <br />The author then goes into what exactly this call looks like. First and foremost is that the call will change the person's life dramatically. They must leave their old situation. This call must be heard and than acted upon. He says, \\"The road to faith passes through obedience to the call of Jesus.\\" (63) He continues on commanding us that Jesus' call is the only thing that makes faith possible. Only the call is important, and this call leads us to faith. He also shows us that faith and obedience are separate but there is a unity between these two in the call to follow Christ. <br />This is where he reiterates that the first step hearing the call and following is the most important piece. Jesus wants us to show him we will follow, not talk about it. It is in this obedience that we show our faith. Bonhoeffer than attempts to show us that if we are trying to keep some part of our life under our own control, we are being disobedient.<br />This document finishes with the author's treatise on the rich young man who came to Christ and asked what he needed to do to have eternal life. Christ knew this about the young man and told him to leave everything and follow him. The young man was presented with this and could not, and went away sad. Bonhoeffer shows us how Christ creates a situation where there can be \\"no retreat.\\" (75) This man was confronted with the eternal Son of God, and walked away. <br />Bonhoeffer is completely convincing in his call to discipleship. There is hardly any way one can argue with what he has to say about the life of Christ and what Christ is calling us to do. He backs this up with sound doctrine, using the example of three disciples and how they did or did not follow Jesus' call. The author shows what each man had to do to follow Christ, the perfect example being Levi who just simply hear the call, and went. The interesting disciple is the third disciple who wanted to map out his own course for living, and in that he had lost his way. The author was strong here in showing that we must follow Christ and not set any stipulations along the way. It is all or nothing in Bonhoeffer's view, which he convinces this reader is completely accurate. <br />There is no lack of clarity in the statement; \\"The road to faith passes through obedience to the call of Jesus.\\" (63) How can anyone ever learn what true faith is unless we are under the will of God for our lives. Bonhoeffer reinforces my view that unless Christ is transforming us through following his call, our faith is empty and really no faith at all. <br />I do disagree with Bonhoeffer on one small point, I believe faith is possible before the call of Jesus, it is faith that even lets us get to the point of hearing his call. But this is a small and semantic point, but one I would raise as a slight weakness in this essay. I do completely agree with Bonhoeffer that obedience is separate but essentially intertwined with faith. Overall the author was completely convincing in his call to discipleship. I have read this essay a few times before this class and each time I cannot walk away and not be challenged by what he has to say. I think if you are living and being transformed by Christ, you cannot ignore this work by Dietrich Bonhoeffer.	2001-05-17

I am sure this book would have helped my parents deal with what I went through a great deal had they read it while I was in high school.  In this book, Mueller attempts to show parents, youth workers, and anyone who cares about teens what they are experiencing during those tumultuous years between thirteen and nineteen.  Mueller introduces his reader to the material aiming mostly at parents of teenagers; this required me as a reader to always be asking how does this affect my ministry, or my students.  While this was mostly helpful it would generally be a better guide for parents than youth workers.  He then goes on to talk about teens and how they are influenced by music, the media, and how parents should help their teens navigate through this complicated web of adolescence.  Although a little bit out of step with today's fads, Mueller's points hit the right chords and can still be applied today.  I again found myself having to switch my frame of reference to make the examples current.  The author then dives into looking at what pressures teens face today from peer pressure, to love and relationships including sex, and popular culture as a whole.  He turns from those topics into drug and substance abuse and depression and the state of teen's psyche.  Mueller brings his book together in a fairly good fashion by helping to show parents how to point their children towards Christ.  I really enjoyed how Mueller had practical ideas for parents at the end of each chapter.  There is nothing worse than a book on a topic that does not offer practical advice, but Mueller did not leave this important part out.  I would like to use Muller's practical opinions on the media and its influence on teens to do a Sunday school series on how the media can influence teens and what they need to do to be aware of what is swirling around them at all times.  I think we underestimate the power of the media and Mueller softly reminds us of how we need to be vigilant as to what we put into our heads, consciously or unconsciously.  The author's practical applications prodded this reader to look at where I could make a small dent in these influences, or at least make my students more aware of what is going on around them.  I did find the statistics the author used to be somewhat closed to the evangelical community.  I think in order to have a more balanced use of evidence Muller could have opened his eyes up to some more secular statistics and surveys, hopefully to balance out the information he received.  In general this book was helpful and practical.  I would recommend it to parents of students in my youth group, with the simple caveat of changing the examples to current examples as much as possible.f the media and Mueller softly reminds us of how we need to be vigilant as to what we put into our heads, consciously or unconsciously.

Although I do not completely agree with Greg Boyd's 'Open View' of God, it is none the less within the realm of acceptability in Evangelical Christianity. Greg Boyd teaches at Bethel College and would be thrown out if he was a heretic. I have give this book to countless people who were struggling with whether to make a change in their lives, this book helped many answer questions they had about God, and take positive steps towards a relationship with him.  While this book does not answer every question out there, it is a great place to start someone who has little interest or is just starting to get interested in a new step on the journey of faith.<br />Christians who read this and point to Boyd's use of an 'Open View' of God, are looking at only one part of this amazing book. Is there any doubt Greg's letters were used by God to reach his father? <br />I gave this book to my own father and it has prompted many discussions as to whether or not God is real, why someone should bother to even wonder about such questions, etc. etc.  God used this book for much good in my Dad's life.  <br />I recommend this book for anyone who has questions about God, and faith, and the search for the meaning of life.  You will not find it all in this book, but it is a good place to start.  Another great work to read in addition to this book, is Mere Christianity by CS Lewis.	2000-05-12
