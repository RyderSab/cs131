How can Stephen Mitchell even think of such an abberation - editing Walt Whitman's greatest poem? Sure, there are several versions of the Song of Myself, but if you want to read Whitman, read the original. The first version is the most powerful, and Whitman toned it down over the years, turning it into \\"poetry\\" rather than his initial burst of enthusiasm. There are several editions of the poem that will let you get the true texts: for example, the Library of America's complete Whitman has both the first version of Leaves of Grass and the \\"deathbed\\" version, which Whitman revised shortly before his death. There are other versions throughout Whitman's career, as he added poems to the Leaves, and tinkered with existing poems. But this book is a sham. Avoid it.	2005-05-25

Hundreds of them, on the wider scope of novels, on the specifics of short stories, or on the techniques of dialog, scenes and plot. Many of these books are useful, but they all tend to focus on popular, commercial fiction, generally genre fiction. <br /> <br />I guess if you want to write genre fiction (nothing against it - I read plenty of it), then these books are fine. But for me, embarking on writing serious fiction, none of these books helped very much. Philip Gerard's book fills the gap that these other books have left in the market. It approaches writing fiction for those who want to write novels that make readers think. He covers enough of the basics (tone, point of view, style) to make this a good generalist book, but, above all, doesn't talk down to the reader. In addition, he inpsires you to think of the broader aspect of writing a serious novel. <br /> <br />As a full-time writer of non-fiction, I'm hoping to leap over the fence into fiction. This is the best book I have yet found that gives me the inspiration and the tools to do so. I have already read it three times, and have gotten more out of it each time. If you want to write serious fiction, this is the only book that really helps you do so.	2004-10-27

As a lapsed meditator, I'm familiar with watching the breath, but over the years had developed a habit of trying to breath too much, and, in return, not breathing well.<br />This book gave me first of all a chance to look at my breathing and see how it should be. The early sections of the book, that discuss how you breathe, and above all how you should let yourself breathe, recentered me in this area. Then the exercises let me relax and calm my breathing, until it quickly got back to a more normal ryhthm and depth. While there's a long way to go, the book's many exercises and insights provide an ideal program for rediscovering the breath and letting it do its work correctly.	2004-06-14

That's part of the joy of a good series like this; finding out more about characters and how they react.<br />Robinson's books can be a bit convoluted, but in a good way. This story of a serial killer, his wife, and her past, surprises at every turn, and, while the ending is somewhat to be expected, Robinson carries this out with brio and subtlety. Unlike some suspense novels, where a lot of focus is on shocking the reader, this book is all understatement. The Aftermath of the title, which refers to a female character's past and how this past comes back full circle, is harsh and painful, but Robinson tells this story with just the right amount of detachment.<br />Many people read suspense novels to see how good and evil interact. Others to figure out whodunit. In Aftermath, you get both. A must read.	2004-04-22

With a pen that merits his frequent contributions to the New Yorker and other magazines, he is also an erudite and lover of knowledge. In this book, he gives an interesting overview of ideas in the late 19th century in the US. Unlike what the blurb says, this book is about more than just the &quot;Metaphysical club&quot; where James, Pierce, Holmes and Dewey met and talked; in fact, this club was short-lived.<br />But Menand uses this as a core around which he traces the ideas of these four great men and the others who inspired them and who they inspired. From Emerson in Concord through the early 20th century, this book examines some of the finest minds in one of America's most fertile periods. I would have liked to see more about James - arguably the most important thinker presented in the book - and a bit less density in some of the explanations of different philosophical systems. But the book is well-written, interesting, and Menand gives the right balance of ideas and events to help you understand this powerful period in the history of American thought. <br />I'd give it another half-star if I could; my only regret is the occasional dense passage that cuts away the rhythym of the narrative.	2004-04-21

The synopsis of this book above tells about as much as one can tell without giving away too much. For this is a book full of twists and turns, of characters who are not who they seem (or who are more than they seem), of situations that get turned inside-out.<br />Again exploring a pair of twins (Priest is, himself the father of twins, which could explain this obsession), this book involves several pairs of doubles, of mistaken identity, of confusion caused by shifts in perception. What begins as a relatively simple story, of a writer researching a key moment in (an alternate) history, ends up being one of the most haunting books I have ever read.<br />I won't deny that my interest flagged at moments; the structure of the second part of the book (diary entries, letters, documents) seems dry on the surface, but each piece in this puzzle ends up having much more import than it seems on the surface.<br />Priest excels here in shifting from one reality to another. He never makes them obvious, and these shifts are so subtle and masterful that they sneak up on you.<br />Suffice it to say that this confirms my opinion that Christopher Priest is one of the finest living writers, and that he creates some of the strangest yet cloyingly attractive stories one can find. Far from his origins and label as a &quot;science fiction&quot; writer, Priest has almost defined his own genre.	2004-03-30

Through a series of essays, interviews and other texts, Mailer reflects on his experiences. Mailer's life is like no other writer's, so it's hard to imagine that this will help budding authors, but there is something reassuring about his questioning the quality of some of his works, his sudden rise to fame after the Naked and the Dead became a bestseller.<br />You won't get much concrete advice on writing, but it's a wonderful ride, reading these interesting words by one of America's greatest wordsmiths.	2004-03-27

This book fulfilled its promise and more.<br />Rather than look at a timeline of events, it examines themes that ran through the 20s, presenting key figures, looking at social events, such as the stock market rise and fall and prohibition, and the narrative it presents is lively and immensely interesting.

I found myself skimming the last 200 pages or so, as Carter kept dragging the story out. <br />But it had a certain charm, a certain naivete that comes from a first novel.

It left a bad taste in the back of my mind, after having devoured all four &quot;real&quot; Rabbitt novels in just a few weeks.

He's an attaching character, and the story is interesting and compelling, but finally it is flawed. Schmidt is almost too cut and dried, and the plot is too simplistic - as he comes to terms with his daughter's impending marriage, he meets and falls in love with a twenty-something waitress. <br />But above all, the story ends abruptly, as if the author didn't want to finish it, and rather make another book out of it. I'll probably read the sequel, but with some trepidation.	2004-03-27

It's fun, disjointed, fragmentary, but it fits perfectly with the Dead and their style of living and music-making. In the usual Dorling Kindersly style, this book contains lots of sidebars with illustrations all over the place. There's no narrative, other than time itself. The timeline, that is the thread through this book, moves from the earliest days to Jerry's death and beyond, covering the albums, important concerts, drug busts and all the other highlights of the Dead's career.

After reading Empire Falls, I read all his other novels, and this one stands out by its comic elements. Unlike his other books, this is a true laugh riot from beginning to end. With bizarre situations, characters who are out of place, and tongue-in-cheek humor, Russo gives us a great comic novel. It's hard to say if he should write more in this vein; his other books are far more profound. But this is a great laugh.	2004-03-27

The way Russo creates characters that I can identify with, in the midst of banal situations, is a rare talent.<br />So I naturally bought this book immediately. Russo, however, is a long-distance writer, not a sprinter. His stories don't give him the space he needs to develop characters. While several of the stories in this collection are gems, one cannot help but think that Russo could have taken them further - a few hundred pages further - and make novels out of them.<br />I'll still give this 4 stars because Russo is one of the finest stylests writing in English today, and has one of the best ears for dialog.

The story of Bill's life is presented here more through his recordings than anything else. The early part of his life is sketched briefly, but once he started making records, each individual disc is mentioned, and the circumstances discussed.<br /><br />For fans of Bill Evans, who tend to be obsessive, this is the ideal guide to his work. While some of the author's judgements about the quality of certain recordings or live performances are perhaps a bit subjective, this is the companion that all Bill Evans fans must have.<br /><br />September 2010: I just went back and reread this book, and found that, the second time around, this book really isn't that interesting. It's a commented discography, as I said in my initial review, which certainly has value. But so little of Evans' life is discussed that it's disappointing in the end. One example: the author mentions that Bill Evans played on Glenn Gould's piano, and at another point he says that Evans and Gould were friends; I would have liked to know more about that. Evans certainly had a life beyond his recordings and performances, and this book doesn't cover that part of his life at all. (With the exception of a mention of his marriages, the birth of his son, and a couple of other events.) I don't want to see something that goes into detail about his love life, but I would like to know more about his relationships with non-musicians during his lifetime.<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer pointed out, there's no discussion of the influence of drugs on his music, which, clearly, was very important. Evans was, for much of his career, a junkie, and this affected how he played. (That he was able to play so well in spite of the drugs is, in itself, amazing.)<br /><br />I'll give this four stars for the coverage of the recordings, which is complete, but as a bio, it's far from that.	2004-03-27

But there is an Everyman quality in Sully's lackadaisical attitude toward life, his easy-going nature, his friendliness and grumpiness. He's the kind of person you'd never notice in a diner, but he's deeply ingrained in the life of this small community.<br />Richard Russo has a talent for developing characters, through their actions and the subtle flashbacks that talk about their pasts. Sully is the quintessential Russo character, and is charming and amiable, even if he can be a pain in the ass. But like all humans, he has good and bad qualities, and this book, more than anything, shows us how human being act in good and not so good ways.<br />This is such a good book it would go on my desert island list.	2004-03-27

Logan Gonzago Mountstuart was a (fictional) writer, spy, art dealer and all around rennaissance man who lived through the great events of the 20th century. This book is written as a diary, and, at first, one can find it a bit tedious, as the your Mountstuart writes clumsily about his experiences.<br />But quickly, this book becomes almost obsessive, as Boyd draws his character with subtle strokes. I was so drawn into this book that I found it hard to put down. Being the first Boyd novel I read, I didn't know what to expect, but I'm certainly going to read others. This character's life is interesting and inspiring, and watching him rise, fall, and finally die is deeply moving.	2004-03-27

While my network is simple - and getting the AirPort network up and running for my Macs was a breeze - it does involve a DSL modem, a switch, an AirPort base station acting as a bridge to a wired Ethernet network, and several computers, including PCs. I remember spending a fair amount of time when first setting it up to get everything working correctly, especially the link between the wired and wireless network. Negrino and Smith walk the reader through all the steps required to set up and configure an 802.11 network, and cover the sticky issues concerning IP addresses, DHCP addressing and many other acronyms that novice users may be unfamiliar with.<br />One of the strengths of this book is the authors' tone of voice. Negrino and Smith assume that the reader does not know a lot about the many protocols and acronyms used, and they explain these elements in a cool and patient manner. There is no talking down to the reader, nor is there any obfuscation. The explanations are clear and simple, and readers will be able to set up a wireless network - no matter how complex - with ease.<br />But the book goes beyond mere WiFi networking, with a thorough presentation of Bluetooth, cellular connectivity, Rendezvous and more. No matter which wireless technologies you want to use with Mac OS X, this book explains them in simple, non-geeky language. <br />As more people - even home users - have multiple computers, connecting them is the best way to leverage all their functions. Wireless networking is, as the authors say, &quot;simple the most cost-effective and least obtrusive way to connect all of your computers.&quot; If you've been tempted by wireless networking, and have been hesitant, thinking that it's complex and complicated, invest in this book - it's the perfect toolkit for setting up all kinds of wireless networking with Mac OS X.	2004-03-24

He uses a true vernacular style and vocabulary, giving non of the false archaism with which translations of works of this period are generally imbued. It's clear that he is a poet first, and a translator second.<br />But he also avoids the tack chosen by Seamus Heaney in his Beowulf; Heaney delighted in using obscure words from time to time, which does not fit with the context of such works. These tales were declaimed, read out loud, and to groups of people who were certainly not learned. What may seem obscure in the original - or what may have an obscure equivalent today - shouldn't sound as such in a translation. These tales need to be rendered in contemporary language, as they were heard in the contemporary languages of their originators.<br />On the down side, Merwin seems to fall into the trap of false cognates - words that, while spelled the same, have different meanings today. A few examples:<br />On page 27, Gawain says &quot;And if my request is improper, I ask this great court not to blame me.&quot; The middle English word, blame, is closer to today's &quot;censure&quot;, &quot;criticize&quot;, or even &quot;find fault with&quot;. Given the vernacular treatment of this translation, the reader is more likely to seize the first meanings that come to mind when reading. Blame does, indeed, hold the meaning that is used in the original, but it is far from the most common usage of the word.<br />Again on page 27, king Arthur say to Gawain, &quot;Take care, cousin.&quot; The original word, cosyn, means kinsman, and was often used to denote a niece or nephew (and, indeed, Gawain, on the previous page, points out that Arthur is his uncle). So the use of cousin here is incorrect, since the relationship between the two men is not that of cousin, but clearly of uncle and nephew.<br />He also succumbsto the tyranny of the original word order, and the desire to leave no word untranslated. On page 27, he translates, &quot;The blood gushed from the body,&quot; which has a &quot;the&quot; too many. English doesn't need an article before a non-count noun like &quot;blood&quot;, though this article exists in the original text.<br />All in all, in spite of the minor translator's nits, this is a brilliant work. It reads smoothly and fluidly, and renders the energy and wonder of this tale. If only more medieval works were translated this well, readers would discover how much amazing literature there is from this period.<br />I'm giving it 5 stars in spite of my reservations; Merwin deserves it for achieving such clarity.	2004-02-22

Not that I don't appreciate their judgement, but it's probably more appropriate to see what a novice thinks of this book.<br />I learned how to play chess at an early age, but never played much. I knew the rules, and how to move pieces, but had no idea how to really play. <br />This book took me from the post Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess stage (that's the only other book I had at the time) to a level where I feel comfortable playing the game. While this book starts out at a very low level, don't let it fool you; it skips a lot and gets heavy pretty fast. So it's not ideal for a total beginner, but requires a good deal of attention and is best for someone who can grasp the basics quickly, since the author skips over them in just one chapter.<br />Beyond that, this is an excellent book, and I have already ordered others in the series. The author neither talks down to the reader, nor does he patronize them. It's a relaxed tone, and that helps a lot.<br />The only negative point is that the diagrams don't have coordinates, which makes it a little difficult to get used to spotting the right squares.	2003-12-01

His best-known work, the Story of the Grail, or Perceval, is the first extant example of the grail legend, which was reproduced and altered many times after.<br />Joseph Duggan gives here an excellent overview of the context and issues around the works of Chretien, focusing on such elements as kinship, values, responsibility and knighthood. Some of his ideas are controversial in the field of interpretation, especially his thoughts on the Perceval story, but his clear, concise presentation and focus make this an essential book for anyone who appreciates this fine body of litterature.<br />...well worth [the price]	2003-05-14

It is interesting both to read - the excerpts are all excellent examples of descriptive writing - and to find the right word. However, I don't give it 5 stars because it has no index.

As a displaced New Yorker, living in France for almost two decades, this book made me realize how much I have lost my linguistic roots. I remember drinking egg creams and playing boxball when I was a kid, and all those words that entered English from Yiddish - kvetch, dreck, and many others.<br />This book is laid out like a dictionary, but the descriptions are often meatier than the usual slang dictionary. That makes it a dictionary you can really read, not just look words up in. <br />While a lot could be said about the lack of linguistic rigor in this book - no specific etymological information, no references and notes - it is not meant to be a linguistic work. It is more a book for those curious about the New York dialect, or others, like me, who see it as a stroll down memory lane to the language they grew up with.<br />I would say that there are lots of words that are not specifically New York words, especially those used by the mob. The author quotes far too many Prizzi novels. There are terms (such as punk rock) which certainly did not originate in New York, and are not specific to New York either. And, while the author lists a lot of specific New York food - mostly of Jewish origin, like matzohs, lox, halvah - there is a lot left out: where are knishes? <br />Lots of expressions that are missing; a lot of attention is given to baseball words; but, in the end, this is not meant to be an exhaustive work. It did give me a lot of enjoyment, and can be very useful for those needing information on New York slang. But don't buy it if you are looking for a more general dictionary of slang; it is not complete enough.	2002-05-10
US	53041222	R253UHSNSMOAC	0446676454	72634172	The Extremes	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Brilliant and disturbing	Christopher Preist writes stories that are on the fringe of science fiction. Calling him an SF writer is too limiting - he is a writer with imagination, who writes stories that stretch the limits of imagination.<br />This novel focuses on one character's virtual reality experiences. I won't bother to tell the story - another reviewer already did that. What stands out is this book, though, is the way the plot folds over and over, until the reader loses touch with reality.<br />I say this is a disturbing book as well - when I was reading it, I found it so skewed that I could only read a few paragraphs at a time. I had to stop and do something else for a few minutes, to anchor myself, before coming back to it. Nevertheless, I read it in one day.<br />This book incites a kind of subconscious itch, a discomfort that arises from not knowing what reality the characters is in.  A brilliant work, along the same line as The Prestige, with its multiple realities.<br />In the end, this novel shows that the book is the ultimate virtual reality device. Preist's mastery of a complex plot leads the reader down dark paths to dead-ends, before finally coming to a totally unexpected resolution.<br />Great work, Chris.	2001-12-02

Since then, so much has changed, that Tapscott's theses are  either proven or forgotten.  Sure, some of them still have a chance of  happening, and some of his observations about business in general are  interesting and valid, but too much has changed since then.  If he wrote  the book today, I'm sure he would approach vastly different  subjects.<br />There is a gee-whiz character in the book that is a bit  irksome.  In some parts, it reads like Popular Science in the 1930s - this  awe of new technologies, many of which never made it past the drawing  board, that propels him into elegies of modernism (like the high-school kid  with his own home page - back then that might have been  revolutionary...).<br />One thing bothers me a bit: there is a constant, yet  subtle, advertising for his consulting company and workshops running  through the book.  It almost seems that the book is an ad for the  higher-cost training sessions that he runs.  All the diagrams and tables  are copyright New Paradigm Learning Corporation, whereas, technically, you  don't copyright data in this manner.  This makes me uncomfortable, and it  looks like the author is just trying to constantly remind you that his  makes his real money elsewhere.	2000-08-08

I recently read the Proust biography by Jean-Yves Tadie in French, and have several comments to make.<br />I was expecting to read a real biography of one of the 20th century's greatest authors, but it turned out to be a  long book of little more than intellectual masturbation.<br />I find some of  the pre-publication comments on the Amazon.com site quite perplexing -  &quot;critically acclaimed, best-seller in France...&quot;  Critically  acclaimed, for this sort of book, means only that the authors friends, and  his publisher's hirelings, wrote excellent reviews of the book - in France,  it is all too common to see reviews written by writers who publish or act  as &quot;series editors&quot; for the same publisher as the book they are  reviewing.  Unlike in the US, where, at least is some periodicals,  reviewers are independent, these reviews are obviously nothing more than  advertisements.  And best-selling, well, that is naturally relative.   Having worked in a French bookstore for 3 years, and being involved in  publishing in this country, I know that this means nothing more than that  the book sold better than expected.  When you read the term  &quot;best-seller&quot; in English, you tend to think of such books as Tom  Clancy or John Grisham, and I can imagine that this biography sold nowhere  near one tenth of what those books sell in France.<br />But I wonder exactly  what the critics acclaimed in this book?  Was it the overlong lists of  people Proust knew, the thousands of footnotes, the neverending quotes that  the author peppered his text with?  This is a fine example of a biography  that was written for scholars and is, as is often the case, poorly written,  inspiring me when reading it with nothing more than the desire to get to  the end.  The author writes like a scholar, which is fine if you like that  style (although I feel sorry for the translator who has to put this work  into English).  But this is a minor problem compared to the total lack of  character that he develops.<br />For me, the benchmark for literary  biographies is the Richard Ellman biography of James Joyce.  Not only does  he examine the author's life, and work, but ties the two of them together.   At the end of the book, the reader has the feeling that he  &quot;know's&quot; Joyce, that he understands his personality.  In this  book, the personal aspect is totally missing - if I hadn't read other  biographies of Proust before, I would undoubtedly not understand his life.   While Tadie mentions often enough Proust's illnesses and anxiety, and  mentions his homosexuality more than enough, the reader learns very little  about Proust other than the people he met and added to his novel.  For  while La Recherche is a roman a cle, and it is useful to know who the  characters represent, it is also a highly introspective novel where a  better knowledge of the author is far more valuable to its  understanding.  I found little in this book  that was interesting.  For a biography (in French) that truly depicts  Proust as the person he was, and gives insight into his life and feelings,  the book written by Ghislain de Diesbach in the early 1990s is far more  interesting.  The Tadie book is useful perhaps if you want to look up who  was the source for a given character, but other than that, read Proust's  work - you will learn far more about his life in La Recherche du Temps  Perdu...	2000-08-03

While I half-expected it to be a really  basic presentation of the Mac OS 9, I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only  is it an excellent book for newcomers, but David Pogue presents all the  tricks and shortcuts that you would be hard pressed to find in the help  files.
