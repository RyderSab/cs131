US	52768062	R3FSV9TMX48RGO	0785812326	163115677	Racing Cars: Masterpieces of Engineering	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A good introduction to motor sports racing	This book was written by a British writer, which gives it a nice European flair since motorsports has pretty much been influenced by European drivers and teams since the early races in the late 1800's.<br />The book is broken down by motorsports segment, with each particular type of racing receiving a chapter dedicated to its history, famous teams, illustrations and photos of the cars, and top drivers and teams up to the 2000 season. This is very convenient for those who are looking for information on a particular class or sanctioning body. Each chapter is sufficiently long to address each type of racing, without being too burdensome.  The author has really done his homework and gone to a good bit of trouble to include forms of racing which I'll probably never see, such as the Australian Touring Class races that feature cars unique to Australia, similar to the Toyotas, Hondas, Fords, BMWs, and pocket Mercedes cars sold here in the USA.<br />The illustrations are particularly nice, a good blend of photographs from the races and artist sketches of cut-aways to show how a particlar car is set up underneath its skin.  The photographs are full-color and printed on glossy paper, with a very nice presentation.  The writing is fun to read, particularly when the author includes anecdotes from his own racing experiences.  After reading his introduction to the book, I'm starting to look at my 1993 Honda Civic EX with a different view (If I tighten the suspension a bit, add a low-flow intake and exhaust system, install a racing seat, pop-rivet a sheet of aluminum across the back seat to keep the gas tank out of the cabin, this baby just might be race ready!)<br />The book was written for the general population and doesn't get too bogged down with technical details, so it could easily appeal to anyone who's enjoyed watching a race on tv.  After reading the book, you may just want to see a NASCAR, Grand Prix, or GT endurance race for yourself, and perhaps spring for a paddock pass!	2002-01-07

You command a WW2 US navy sub in the south Pacific, chasing freighters, oilers, transports, warships, and conducting espionage and raids on port cities.  The manual that comes with the game is fantastic, so there's nothing really much left to tell in this game guide other than how to beat the missions and how to use the thermal layers to hide from the destroyers.  As a guide, its a good reference but you'll still need the manual.	2001-11-07

The author has done a thorough job of corroborating theories of how certain submarines &quot;died&quot; by comparing official US Navy documents with IJN reports.<br />While the writing doesn't compare with the &quot;you are there&quot; styles of &quot;Thunder Below&quot;, &quot;Clear The Bridge!&quot;, and &quot;Wahoo&quot; by other authors, this book does do a good job of reporting the too-brief combat careers of US submarines.  Pictures accompany the text for each submarine and are in black and white. The chapters are short and easy to read, and you won't need to possess any particular knowledge of how submarines operate to understand how the boats were destroyed.  Submarine fans will want a copy.  Naval historians will want a copy.  Anyone who's played a submarine game and enjoyed it will want a copy.  But if you're looking for action, you might try &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; or any of the numerous sub commander memoirs that have been published (including the ones mentioned in this review).	2001-11-05

For this book, he turned that skill and knowledge to lead an expedition to examine the wrecks of one of the bloodiest naval battles of World War II, one so full of death and destruction that veterans of the battle gave the waters of Gualdalcanal the nickname of &quot;Iron Bottom Sound&quot; because of the number of ships and aircraft that lay underwater. Guadalcanal was the linchpin of American and Japanese military strategy for control of the south Pacific islands. The Americans controlled the airfield, but the Japanese controlled the island and the waters around it. The Japanese couldn't resupply its army because of attacks to its freighters by Allied aircraft and the Americans couldn't resupply its airfield because of attacks to its fleet of ships. In one single battle in the pitch-black darkness of night, the mighty Japanese fleet engaged a weaker American destroyer group where American guns were aimed by radar and Japanese guns were aimed by looking for the flashes from the American weapons. The American fleet was destroyed but it was a Pyhric victory because the Japanese supply ships failed to reach the starving Japanese troops on the island. Dr. Ballard does a remarkable job of capturing both the essence of the battle and the essence of underwater archeology to create a wonderful book filled with full-color pictures of the wrecks and period black-and-white pictures of the war. He also includes the fantastic paintings and maps in the style that has adorned his other books to show how the wrecks would look if there was absolute clarity underwater and with a &quot;God's Eye&quot;. This book is one of the better ones I've found that deal with the ships of Guadalcanal and underwater archeology. I've noticed copies adorning the workbenches of many model-ship builders (including mine). Its a great gift idea and sure to please anyone interested in great battles, maritime history, WW2, underwater exploration, or tales of bravery (by those who fought and those who study the ocean).	2001-08-27
US	52768062	RK9FSWGPJJURY	0061050806	744002487	NASCAR: The Definitive History of America's Sport	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Great pictures, good text, but could use more drama	Great photos of the early days of NASCAR and of today's events, but not much from &quot;the middle years&quot;.  Background reference material is well thought out and organized and is easy to read.  Very entertaining overall but I would have appreciated a better description of the evolution of the cars and how the sport transitioned from racing jallopies purchased at used car lots to today's purpose-built machines that resemble the family's Pontiac in appearance only.  In fact, the book seems to gloss over the 70's and 80's as quickly as it took Richard Petty to capture his first 10 victories (he would reach the history-making 200 victory mark in the 1980's).  Instead, most of the focus is on the leadership of Bill France in taking the sport through the early days of dirt tracks and leather helmets and then re-focuses on RJ Reynolds' sponsorship and the France family's positioning the organization as a high-visibility corporate billboard (not that there's anything wrong with that - its the American way).  It also doesn't really delve into the tragedies of NASCAR drivers, such as the deaths of Petty, Allison, and others who died at the tracks.<br />Still, its a good starting point for understanding NASCAR's history and makes for good entertainment, even for folks who don't really follow automobile racing.	2001-06-07

The top ten most-attended sports events in 2000 were all NASCAR races, and of these races the 500 mile race at Daytona International Speedway is the crown jewel.  For 10 days the town eats, sleeps, and breathes NASCAR motor racing.  This book captures in pictures the start of the NASCAR season, including the IROC Firebird races, the Craftsman Truck series, the Busch series, and the main event - the Daytona 500 Winston Cup race.  Its an excellent photojournal of modern-era racing from the perspective of the crews, the drivers, the fans, and just about everyone else, but like most photojournals there isn't much information about the history of the sport or any other useful reference information.  Still, the people who buy this book probably already know the history of NASCAR racing anyway.	2001-06-07

Hunting grounds in the Pacific were discovered and, after a year's journey rounding South America in which it lost half of its boats in a sudden gale, the whale ship Essex set out to fill its hold with the valuable whale oil armed with only 3 small boats.  During a hunt, one of the boats was stove by the death throes of a speared sperm whale and returned to the ship.  While enacting repairs, the pings of the first mate's hammer attracted the attention of a large bull sperm whale, a creature uniquely designed for ramming.  The bull made two charges, collapsing the bow of the ship on either side of the keel, and 20 men found themselves alone, in 3 open boats, deep in the heart of the blue Pacific, with only faint hopes of rescue.<br />The Essex did not sink immediately, and the men were able to salvage a few casks of water, some navigational instruments, and hard biscuits (which would later be fouled by ocean spray and induce dehydration in the men).  The first mate also had paper and pencil, which he used for keeping a daily diary of their attempts to survive the ravages of storms, thirst, hunger, and attacks by killer whales and large sharks.<br />I read this book prior to reading &quot;In The Heart of The Sea&quot;, also by Nathaniel Philbrick, and I was glad I did.  The first-person narratives really bring home the tale, and Philbrick's other book helps fill in the historical background.  I would recommend reading this book with a good atlas, so that you can plot the narrator's progress as he tries to bring his ship to South America, against the wind, the current, and his dwindling strength, and realize just how screwed these sailors really were.	2000-10-10

Each chapter is well illustrated with period paintings and  photographs, with particular focus on the &quot;Golden Age of Piracy&quot;  in the 16th and 17th century when galleons and merchant brigs carried gold,  jewels, sugar, cotton, and rum from the Spanish Main to the American  colonies and Europe.<br />Well written and easy to read, each page is printed  on glossy paper and clean typeface, with illustrations to help convey the  mood of the book.  Its an entertaining history of piracy (and if a book  isn't entertaining, then why read it?).  It may not have the depth of some  of the more scholastically-oriented books available, but this book is a  good place to start when building your library.<br />Overall, a good book to  have around.	2000-09-18

Separated from his sweetheard, Russell was sent to Australia as part of a submarine  repair/refresh crew.  While there, he did two things (a) fell in love with  a local girl and (b) got his wish to serve on a combat patrol aboard a US  attack submarine.  He served the last two war patrols of the USS Flying  Fish before the war's ending sent him home to an uncertain future.  His  first patrol found him cruising the south Pacific, engaging Japanese  shipping during the island-hopping campaign.  His second patrol was  probably the most exciting time of his life, as his boat was sent, along  with 8 others, into the impenetrable Sea of Japan.  Courageous submarine  pilotage was required to get the 9-boat task force through the minefields  and natural barriers on the southern coast of Japan.  From there, the force  split up as each submarine took up its assigned station.  In a coordinated  attack, the boats sent torpedoes against targets at each port along Japan  and Korea, sinking whatever they could, photographing the facilities for  future intelligence ops, and taking prisoners for interrogation.  The  surprise attacks were a complete success, but resulted in the loss of a  single submarine.  Russel's interpretation of that loss is vividly  recounted in the book, one of the better passages.  The book does a nice  job of placing the reader in the forward torpedo room, Russel's station,  which is a nice change from the books written by former skippers and  admirals.  I also enjoyed the passages where Russel describes his life  immediately after his discharge from the Navy, when he left civilization to  clear his mind of the war memories, and of the friends who threw him a  lifeline back to America.  I only regret that the writing style had been a  bit more descriptive.  Still, the book is a good afternoon read.	2000-02-18

Lots of pictures and diagrams, printed on glossy paper, easy to understand and follow, this book is a good  primer for those who are looking to improve their air combat skills in  flight simulators.  It follows the history of air combat from WW1 to  today's modern jets, and for each conflict it highlights the tactics used  by pilots as they match their plane against the enemy.  Norman Franks  selects particular dogfights in each war to serve as examples of how  fighter pilots put their aircraft's strengths to good use when battling in  the skies.  Speed, maneuverability, guns, durability ... all of these are  taken into account.  <br />This book knows its audience - mainstream America -  and seeks to entertain and educate at the same time.  Its a good book to  keep around and appeals to fans of aviation of all ages.	2000-01-17

The photographs are  accompanied by text which explains unique features of the photo.  A useful  reference for scale modelers who want to customize stock plastic kits.   Plenty of shots of landing gear, IR sensors, cockpit (as much as can be  shown for an unclassified document) and engine.  If you're looking for  information on how the bird actually works, you're better off with a copy  of the &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; PC flight simulation game manual or Shaw's  &quot;Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering&quot; book.	1999-11-16

I ran for 10 years, off and on, starting a program, getting frustrated or injured, and then stopping it  for awhile.  <br />Then I found this book and read it and got a good  ground-level education on the sport of jogging and running.  The material  is presented in a very funny and entertaining manner, with plenty of  pictures and sidebars.  The book even includes a tear-out chart for  starting a training program that you can post on the refrigerator.<br />I  would recommend you read this book as a way to develop a basic knowledge of  running safely and effectively, and then purchase Bob Glover's  &quot;Runner's Handbook&quot; for even more (and better) information and  John Cronin's &quot;Runner's Log&quot; for tracking your progress.<br />This  is a good book to read before you start your way in the sport, but it  should not be the only one in your library.	1999-08-23

Based on letters, pictures, and accounts written by the doomed airmen, their  families, friends, and associates, and interviews with the only surviving  member of the crew (who was so shaken by the tragedy that he avoided  reunions and interviews for several years), Childers takes you through the  crew's basic training and service in England up to the final mission.  From  there, he explains his adventures in researching his family history and  enlisting the help of an amateur German historian in piecing together the  final moments of the airplane.  Yes, you may even cry as Childers puts a  name to a face and a spirit to a body that perished long before its time.    Get this book.  You won't be disappointed.	1999-06-18

Chuck Carlock is a veteran of the Vietnam War and a member of a military helicopter pilots association, which gives him access to both his memories and those of his buddies.  Fly with him as he takes you out on missions in  Huey gunships and slicks (so named because they carried no guns, hence  their sides were 'slick') as he crisscrosses some of the hottest spots in  the theatre.  And when he's done with you, his buddies step in and take you  on med evac hops and Special Forces inserts deep inside Cambodia.  Hands  down, this is the best book of 'Nam chopper flying I've read (except for  perhaps 'Chickenhawk').  And after you've read this book, pop 'Apocalypse  Now' or 'Platoon' in the VCR (or DVD) and get the total 'Nam experience.	1999-06-18

Hard-core fans for Forester will really appreciate the details that went  into making the Companion, and casual fans will develop a better sense of  how things flow along in the novels.<br />Too bad the Naval Institute Press,  one of the better publishers out there, decided to put it on backorder so  soon.  Hopefully, with the recent television series generating interest,  the book will be re-released.	1999-04-22

As a result, this book takes full advantage of the magazine's long lineage, filters out the fluff, and leaves  even a novice surfer like me feeling like I've been surfing all of my life.   Matt's writing style is simple yet elegant, and he covers just about every  aspect of surfing you can imagine, from surfboard manufacturing, to Duke  Kohanomaku, to surf competition, to surf culture, to Mark Foo's tragic  death in the mid-1990's.  The only thing he doesn't cover is  &quot;how-to&quot;, but there are enough books about that already (one good  one is Doug Wermer's &quot;Start-Up Surfing&quot;).  I highly recommend  this book to all ocean-lovers, surfers and non-surfers alike.  Gorgeous  photo's, excellent text.  Almost as good as being there.	1999-03-25

It lists just about every beach along the Florida coastline from Jacksonville up through the Panhandle, listing public beach access points and top surf spots  (including how the waves break).  I particularly enjoyed the bios on the  local surfers, such as Frieda Zamba (found under the listing for Flagler  Beach) and Lisa Anderson (Ormond Beach).<br />The book breaks the Florida  coastline down into sections, such as Northeast Florida, East Central,  Southeast, Southwest, West Central, and Panhandle,  and gives the best  spots for each beach in the section, including overcrowding conditions,  water hazards, lifeguards (or not), parking spots, bathhouses, and public  access points.  The book also talks about the best times of the year to  visit the areas and what kind of waves to expect.  The book also talks  about famous swells in each zone, such as Hurricane Andrew in the Panhandle  and the No Name Storm of Clearwater/St.Petersburg Beach.  <br />Although  oriented towards surfers, this book is also a useful reference for other  beachgoers as well (particularly since it lists the public access points  and tells you where the food stands and bathrooms are).  Very useful for  families.<br />Overall, this book is well worth its price.  I would recommend  this book to anyone who is going to be visiting Florida or lives in Florida  and is looking for a new spot.  <br />Its also a useful resource for beginning  surfers who want to blend with the local crowds :)	1999-03-23

The book itself is worth buying.  It starts out with a brief overview of the Soviet  development of the nuclear submarine after World War 2 and their race with  the US design teams.  The next chapter discusses ancient designs and then  John Holland's first submarine, which was funded by an Irish  &quot;Anti-England&quot; group in the US.  <br />The book covers WW1 and WW2  submarine battles, famous ships with quotes from men who served on them,  the US and Soviet cold war submarine warfare strategies, clandestine  activities and design techniques.  It also covers the deep sea unmanned  submersibles such as &quot;Alvin&quot; and the recovery of the hydrogen  bomb off of the coast of Spain in the 1960's and the discovery of such  wrecks as the &quot;Titanic&quot; and the &quot;Lusitania&quot;.<br />Overall,  its a very thorough overview of the history of submarines and a good  introduction to the world of submarine warfare.  Plenty of charts and  pictures to assist in understanding the text.  There is only one instance  of profanity and that's a result of a direct textual representation of the  crew's dialogue while searching for the H-bomb - navigating shifting  currents, poor visibility, cramped quarters, and long hours can test even a  scientist at times.  <br />I would highly recommend this book for everyone.	1999-02-10

As a scout, he wanted to fly and become a pilot and eventually Hitler's war machine gave him the  opportunity.  This book is a journal, not quite a diary, of his life as a  Luftwaffe pilot and top &quot;experten&quot; (what we would call an  &quot;ace&quot;)on the Eastern and Western Fronts, from the battle for  Kursk to the fall of the Reich.  Each section is no more than a few pages  long, but it speaks volumes about the philosophy of the Luftwaffe pilots  and their dedication to their country and their rather low opinion of their  Fuhrer.  A good bedside read, or reading on the go.  I would recommend it  for aviation enthusiasts and anyone interested in history.	1999-01-05

Hopefully this book will be around a bit longer, or will  be replaced with a better edition (preferably in hardback).  In the  meantime, a good simulation of the jet for the home computer is Graphic  Simulation's &quot;F/A Hornet 3.0&quot; and its sequel &quot;Hornet:  Korea&quot;.  &quot;Hornet: Korea&quot; comes with a very good manual that  presents a pretty good idea about the jet itself (depending on the accuracy  of the software in simulating the Hornet's avionics). See also  &quot;Hornets Over Kuwait&quot; by Jay Stout, for a Marine pilot's view of  the Hornet during Desert Shield/Storm.

This is a collection of rememberences and recollections told with the straightforward style of a man who's flown jet aircraft most of his life.<br />He explains how his parents went from selling auto parts to owning their own Buick and Pontiac dealership in Oklahoma, and how on a visit to them during training he was pulled over by a sheriff's deputy just outside of town.  He thought he had been speeding in his Pontiac convertible hotrod and was getting a ticket, but the deputy did a bit of hotrodding himself and wanted to challenge this young pilot to a race.  Thinking that the deputy was just trying to get an easy speeding ticket out him, Mr. Cook was a bit cautious. The solution: the deputy would signal the start of the race and turn on his siren and lights so that people would think he was chasing Mr. Cook.  It sounded fair enough so off they went to a lonely stretch of highway.  They picked a start point and end point and the race was on.  Cook's Pontiac took off like a rocket and soon the deputy's hopped-up hardtop was a dot in the rear view mirror. At the end of the race, Mr. Cook got out and the deputy jumped in his Pontiac.  &quot;Now we'll race back to town!&quot; he said as the Pontiac shot off down the road.  Mr. Cook got in the deputy's car and drove back to town, in no particular hurry since he had proven his point already.<br />He found his Pontiac in the parking lot of his dad's dealership and he could see the deputy in a heated discussion with Cook's dad.  Exercising the better part of valor he hung out in the mechanics bay until things cooled down.  After awhile his dad came looking for him and asked him if he knew what that discussion was about.  Thinking that his joy-riding days were over, Mr. Cook muttered a few things, but before he could finish his dad said that he had just sold a brand new Pontiac hardtop to the deputy and that he had Mr. Cook to thank for it.  Cook's dadnever found out exactly how the deal wa! s done.<br />And there are a few stories about pretty girls, life, and death, and combat.  I haven't gotten to the part where he gets transferred to 'Nam yet, but I expect the rest of the book to be just as entertaining and well-written as the first parts are.<br />This review really doesn't do justice to the book.  I think that this book could become one of the classics in my air combat library, along with &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; by Gregory Boyington, &quot;Samurai&quot; by Saburo Sakai, and &quot;Mustang Ace&quot; by Robert Goebel.	1998-06-17

Michel mixes discussion at the strategic level (the decisions about what targets to hit and how hard)with the actual pilot-level action that occurred.  Mr. Michel unashamedly approaches the two disparate theories held by the USAF and the USN in how to handle air-to-air combat and strike mission planning.  The USAF saw the air-to-air loss rates as a problem with the technology.  The USN saw the loss rates as a problem with pilot training.  Not surprisingly, the USN loss ratios improved dramatically a year after the creation of its TopGun air-to-air combat academy, whereas the USAF saw only a minimal improvement in its missile technology.<br />One interesting point is this: even though both the USAF and the USN flew the F-4 Phantom, the Navy missiles wouldn't work on the USAF planes because of a difference in the launch rails.  The problem was in the way that the Sidewinder seeker was cooled prior to launch.  The Navy took one approach to solve the problem and the USAF took another.  The Navy did indeed have a better missile, and when one USAF wing commander demanded that he be supplied with Navy Sidewinders for air-to-air combat, he was severely disappointed to find out that he couldn't have them due to disparate technologies.<br />This isn't a &quot;There I was at 20,000 feet..&quot; type of book.  Its more of a &quot;Oyster Flight was on BarCap at 20,000 feet on Route Package VI when Red Crown vectored them to a pair of MiG-21s launching from Phuc Yen...&quot; type of book.  Still, it is very exciting reading for avaition enthusiasts and air combat students.  There is a careful analysis of each engagement and diagrams are included to illustrate typical strike formations and ECM coverage zones.  Very well done.	1998-06-17

Of his company, he was the only one who was there from the invasion to the surrender.  All of the others were either killed or wounded.  Mr. Wilson's book places you under his helmet, witnessing tree-bursts from German artillery, midnight patrols in pitch-black darkness where every sound is a gun being aimed at you, and the bombing of an Allied tank convoy by American P-47s.  You are the one who nearly steps on a land mine in a pasture in France. <br /> At the end of the book, Mr. Wilson does a gives a bit of his philosophy of combat which I believe is pretty darn good.  I won't spoil it for you - you'll have to read it for yourself - but its the reason why our boys are sent overseas to fight. <br />  Overall, a good read that you may have trouble setting down.	1998-04-28
US	52768062	R13EZVEXKDTGWS	0671747932	659333648	Wings of Fury	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Good jet combat action described between the covers	If you've ever seen the movie 'Top Gun', or have been to an air show, or have flown a PC flight simulator, or have watched CNN's broadcast of Desert Storm, or watched any movie with a jet fighter in it, or have wanted to do any of these things, then you'll want to read this book.  This is a recounting of some of the best jet combat incidents as told to the author by the pilots who flew them.  The stuff is a direct adreneline injection through the heart.  A great read for rush junkies, speed freaks, and combat pilot wannabe's.  If you 'feel the need, the need for speed' then you'll love this book. <br /> 'I have two bogies at angels ten...' will mean something to you.  It will mean that your heartrate is about to accelerate as those General Electrics start to spool up.  You can almost feel the throttle being pushed up past the last detente as you slide the master arm switch to 'On'...	1998-04-27

If you're just getting started in building your library, then get this book!  If you already have a library started and don't know what to find to add to it, get this book! <br /> <BR>  Stephen Coonts draws from a wide range of autobiographies, biographies, and other books and has compiled what I consider to be the most comprehensible collection of the top stories ever written about air combat, from World War I to Vietnam (the hunting ground of America's last ace).  Inside the book you'll find some of the most gripping action as told by the men who lived it or those who's job it was to document it.  A great book for reading on vacation or weekends at the house, as the chapters are self-contained (i.e. one chapter does not lead-in to the next, since each chapter is only a part of a larger book and no book is covered twice).  My advice: get this book, read it, and then make sure you read all of the other books that Coonts uses in this one.  You won't regret it!	1998-04-27

Rather, its a very well-documented study of the changes in U.S. military and political thinking since World War One with a particular focus on the period following the Vietnam War.  The author chronicles the changes in leadership and policy as the veterans of Vietnam were promoted up through the ranks into command positions, how they changed the way the military is utilized in political crisis, and the decisions which affect military weapons procurement.  For example, the workhorse of the Vietnam air campaign was the F4 Phantom II, a supersonic missile platform that wasn't particularly maneuverable, that was developed by the US Navy and thrust upon the US Air Force by a budget-conscious Robert McNamara, head of the Department of Defense at the time.  The Phantom became the darling of the services over the skies of North Vietnam, succeeding in just about every role assigned to it.  Buoyed by this success, McNamara tried to apply the converse theory - take a land-based US Air Force aircraft and apply it to the Navy - which resulted in the failure of the F-111A.  It was this failure which prompted the Navy to develop its own jet fighter - the F-14 Tomcat.  This touched off a long line of fighter aircraft which controlled the skies of Kuwait and Iraq some 20 years after their introduction into the US military: the F-15 Eagle, the F-16 Falcon, and the F-117 stealth strike fighter.  The F-117, by its deployment in a single battle, managed to render 50 years of Soviet military technology development obsolete.  It may have indirectly contributed to the fall of the Soviet regime.  Until I read Mr. Hallion's book, I was not aware of the facts surrounding the development of these fine fighters.  I think the reader will be just as much surprised and educated by the events described in the book as I was. <br /> <BR> Although originally published in 1992, the concepts described in this book are still very much current as we watch arguments unfold around the F-22 stealth air superiority fighter.  Questions concerning the need for a new military aircraft and the expense of a single unit when more units of a lesser quality weapon could be purchased for the same money are reminiscent of the arguments which arose during the development of the F-14 at the end of the Phantom's career.  Mr. Hallion's book lays the groundwork for readers to develop their own opinions concerning military spending - he avoids the trap of forcing his own opinions upon the reader - and he documents his sources liberally throughout the text.  I found it necessary to keep two bookmarks: one for the main text and the second for the notes at the end of the book. <br /> <BR> Accompanying the text are a series of brief essays which discuss particular elements of modern combat theory, such as air power, battlefield, and missile technologies.  I truly enjoyed reading them following the education I received from the main text of the book.  There is also a brief photo section which illustrates several points of the book, including radar screenshots of Iraqi troops fleeing from Kuwait along the Highway of Death, recon photos, the weapons used in the conflict, and the leaders of the forces involved in the fighting. <br /> <BR> This is not a book to take on a trip to the beach and would probably not appeal to those seeking tales of aviation adventure.  Rather, this is a book for enthusiasts and students of air power, strategy, history, and military technology.  For this audience, this is an indispensable resource. I found the book easy enough to read and not as dry as most other books on this subject area tend to be.  Overall, a good read and a good education.	1998-04-25
US	52768062	R1HEARKWLF1YIW	0004708229	735398212	Jane's Fighter Combat in the Jet Age (Jane's Air War, 1)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A valuable asset for students of aviation history	Mr. Isby has done a very commendable job of putting forth the history of jet air combat, starting from the Me-262 and continuing through to the future, including some of the less-documented skirmishes in the Middle East and Africa.  Each section is approximately 2 to 3 pages long, with sidebars and photographs, printed on glossy paper. His assertions are right on the money when he analyzes what tactics worked during certain periods of time and what tactics failed.  The only point I disagree with is Mr. Isby's statement that the P-47 represented the apex of propeller fighter design.  I can name 3 aircraft off the top of my head that would make better examples than the P-47: the Spitfire (which was there when WW2 started and was still the front line fighter when WW2 ended), the P-51 Mustang (which was still operational during Korea), and the F4U Corsair (which also saw action in Korea, alongside the jet-powered Panthers and Cougars).  Other than that, his information is top notch and well illustrated.	1998-03-24
US	52768062	R2X3XUYYE6K4BN	0671674102	797444854	Flights of Passage	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A well-written book about "being".	This is the story of a man who, by Fortune or Fate, became an aviator during WWII.  This book is more about his transformation from boy to man than it is about the history of aviation in World War Two.  Still, its an insightful piece and the imagery is fantastic.  I can still see Mr. Hynes sitting in his tent during a typhoon, and the sunlight glinting off of the Mustang's wings just before it collided and fell into the ocean.  If you're interested in \\"feeling\\", then this book is a \\"5\\".  If you're more interested in the adventure and drama, then this book is a \\"2\\".  My rating is the average of the two, as I bought it for the adventure and ended up with the feeling.	1998-03-24

Its a lot more in-depth than similar books but Shaw's writing style is much oriented towards the educational aspect than the entertainment aspect.  As a result, be prepared for some heavy eyelids if you're reading it after a good meal.  Not a book for light readers or those with only a casual interest in military aviation and aerospace technology.  For that reason, I'm rating it an &quot;8&quot;, although if the criteria was solely the depth of material I'd rate it a &quot;10&quot;.	1998-03-23

Pilots from England, Canada, Australia, USA, Germany, Soviet Union, and Japan are represented in a very read-able text.  I would place the reading level at the advanced high-school/early university grade, and is a very good source of information for those people out there who run flight simulators on their personal computers.  I'm using this book as a reference for developing custom missions for the PC flight simulator &quot;AirWarrior&quot;.  There's enough combat detail to allow the reader to set altitude, location, number and type of aircraft involved, and the outcome.	1998-03-23

(CLASSICS OF NAVAL LITERATURE)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A fantastic story of Sakai's career as an ace pilot	I would consider this to be the companion piece to USMC Major Gregory Boyington's autobiography &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; (which was turned into a movie and a television show) because it gives the perspective of the opponent.  This tells the story of Japan's leading ace to survive the war, from his pre-war decision to join the Navy to his life after the war, when he was prohibited from flying any sort of aircraft for the rest of his life as a condition of Japan's surrender.  His telling of his air combat victories is a good tool for understanding air combat and the demands placed on pilots.  Definitely a good read, and should be a staple in any library.	1998-03-20
