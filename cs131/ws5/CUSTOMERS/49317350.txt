The book was great and the author really impresses upon the goose hunter  the importance of CONCEALMENT. He really thinks that Bale Blind and Texas  Rag decoy are pieces of junk.

I have been only getting less  than 5 geese per season while hunting 15 to 18 times a year. I have more  confidence now.

I learned so much by reading this book that I would like to say Thank You - AMAZON.COM! The chapters on concealment and decoys were great. I did not  realize how well the geese can see. I used to sit in the decoy spread and  the geese would never decoy into my spread. I always wondered why? Do you  know why? They saw me every time. I was stupid and I hate to admit it. This  book was worth $1,000.00 to me.	2000-08-06

I have been making a lot of mistakes, i.e.laying within the  decoy spread, picking the wrong fields to set up in, calling too much,  using that stupid BALE BLIND, using those stupid TEXAS RAGS, talking and  moving while the geese are coming in.
