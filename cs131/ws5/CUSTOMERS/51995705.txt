I thought Vicki Mackenzie captured the personality of Tenzin Palmo quite well. It is Tenzin who emphasizes her views on the need for Buddhism to meet feminism. There is not a whole lot of detail about what Tenzin actually experienced during her long years of solitary meditation, but that's because her own ethical principles won't allow her to brag about insights or experiences. But there is enough to give us a feel for how she lived and what she did during all those long days and nights. I will never forget one sentence that she said. During 12 years alone in a cave in the Himilayas, she reports, despite no books, no news, no television or radio or internet, not even any friends to chat with, she testifies, \\"I was never bored.\\"	2005-10-04

Galland's approach is to take us along for the ride as she explores both psychologically and physically the places of the Dark Mother. Not exactly travel writing, and not exactly spiritual memoir, her book combines some of both styles. Sometimes you may wish she spent less time describing the flowers on her walks and the twists and turns of her own anxieties and questioning. But she is a more or less pleasant travel companion, so if you want to cover the same ground, this is not a bad book.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most was her description of an annual pilgrimage in Poland from all parts of the country to the shrine of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa.  Who knew that a million people spend two weeks every year walking, praying, singing and camping as they return to the Madonna who represents their nation? Who remembered that Lech Walesa was inspired by this Madonna and that Solidarity banners were flown by these pilgrims in spite of being illegal.  I was inspired to recall that a non-violent spiritual movement is what brought freedom to Poland.<br /><br />I also took comfort in the fact that after abandoning her devout Catholicism and practicing first in the Zen tradition and then the Tibetan tradition, China Galland found herself also drawn to re-integrate her own spiritual heritage. Her experiences in Poland and Medjorge Yugoslavia are as important as her visits with the Dalai Lama and Tara initiations.<br /><br />Though the book is a bit dated, most of the issues she raises continue to be relevant.  I read this to help me understand  The Secret Life of Bees better as a teacher, and it certainly does that. I wonder if Sue Monk Kidd may have read it too.	2005-07-04

I have read a lot of books about the old days in Tibet, and this is the best, despite the fact that Maraini never went to Lhasa, the holy grail of most adventurers in those days. But Mariani made no attempt to accompany his employer, the famous Tibetologist Giuseppi Tucci.  Tucci claimed to be a Buddhist in order to be allowed to visit Lhasa, and Maraini wasn't a Buddhist (and suggests that Tucci wasn't either) and so chose not to try to trick or bully his way in to the capital.  That alone makes him more admirable, in my book, than most of the arrogant Europeans who took it for granted that it was their God-given right to poke their noses into other people's cultures any way they could.<br /><br />Maraini actually travelled in Tibet on two different occasions, 1939 and 1948, and telescopes both visits in this book, although most of it is based in the 1948 trip.  As an Italian, and a highly cultured European, he has a somewhat more sympathetic view of Tibet than English and American writers. He compares Tibet not to Nebraska but to Florence, the Italian Alps, Italian Catholicism, and the Vatican.  While Tibet was medieval, in many ways Catholicism in the 30s and 40s could also be called medieval.  Maraini thinks like a man of science, but he knows the mind of Italian peasants as well, and an old woman repeating a mantra is not so different from an old woman in Italy saying her own rosary. So there is a lot of sympathy in his view.<br /><br />He is also clear-sighted.  He does not like dirt and smells, for example, and when he describes the Tibetans, he doesn't pretend not to notice the level of filth.  He admires Buddhism, but not so much that he loses objectivity.  Underground chapels which contain animal carcasses stuffed with straw and rotting away and artwork filled with skulls, human bones and bloody images horrify him, and he says so.<br /><br />He also conveys a wonderful sense of the beauty, the air, the silence, the scale and scope of the Tibetan land.  His book is about people and events, which he describes with piercing insight and analysis.  He describes faces and bodies in terms of the character they reveal. He doesn't fill pages with descriptions of ornery porters and bad trails.  Instead he takes the hardships of travel for granted and describes the personality and character of every person, mountain, monastery, dance, and meal. The fact that he was not hell-bent for Lhasa allows him to be present in each place that he visits.<br /><br />Because he is along on the trip as a photographer, he observes the art intensely.  His writing is vivid, poetic but not pretentious, and the translation from the Italian is flawless, at least as English style goes.  You would never imagine that you are reading a translation.<br /><br />Maraini also had another advantage that makes him the perfect travel companion--he lived and taught in Japan in the years between his first and second trips to Tibet (because WW2 had broken out and he got stranded there) so he can see Tibet not only as it appears to a European but also in the greater context of Asia.<br /><br />The updates that contrast the Tibet he saw and the Tibet of 1998 are saddening but give even richer context to the story.  He intersperses these at the end of each chapter, so you don't have to try remember which monastery or city he is talking about. The book is skillfully edited so that the three time periods involved flow smoothly into one fascinating narrative.<br /><br />I am eager to read Maraini's other works, because he is a man of great insight, an open heart and a clear mind.d.

So I expected to like this as well.  But it's just not as good.<br /><br />There are a surprising number of similarities between the two books.  Both are told in the first person by a woman (one 14, one more like 41) who lost a parent as a child and thinks she is to blame for that parent's death. Both also involve groups of women who have a special bond with each other and African American women who function as earth-mother-goddess types. Both books also have a mysterious artifact that connects Catholic and pagan motifs. And both have improvised semi-Catholic rituals.<br /><br />So in many ways I felt like I was reading about Lily 25 years later.  The use of first-person narrator gives a certain sameness. But in this book, there are shifting points of view. Most chapters are told in the first person, but some chapters are in the third person following Brother Thomas and letting us into his head. And jarringly near the end, we are suddenly in her husband Hugh's head.  Varying view points would be fine, but they all need to be 3rd person.  It's awkward to go from \\"I looked at Brother Thomas\\" to \\"Thomas looked at her.\\" She needs to let go of the female protagonist ans stop making her be \\"me.\\"<br /><br />Kidd's use of metaphor, her description of the natural world and of people's feelings with vivid images, is splendid. But I agree with other reviewers that the characters here didn't have enough depth.  I never feel the spirituality that would have kept Thomas in the monastery for 5 years.  I don't feel (though I am told to) that the main character puts up any struggle against the temptation to cheat on her husband--both she and Thomas seem to be just waiting to fall into each other's arms. For a conventional wife and mother to tear up her life with so little guilt or resistance was not really believable to me.<br /><br />And when we find out the truth about what happened to her father all those years ago, it seems like a deus ex machina.  There has been no preparation for the true reason, no foreshadowing, no sense of aha, now I see, it all fits. It doesn't all fit. It feels contrived. She also over-explains, spelling out every connection and every bit of symbolism.<br /><br />However, the main symbol, the Mermaid Chair, symbolizes what?  It shows a mermaid who left the sea and became a saint.  How does that connect to Jessie and her story? Um, well, it doesn't. But it's mystical, and romantic, and so what if it adds nothing to the story?<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book, but it doesn't have the layering and depth of resonance that made Secret Life of Bees so satisfying.ike a deus ex machina.

After all, she went to a great deal of trouble to get to Tibet, learn Tibetan, meet lamas, stay in mountain retreats and borderland monasteries. She must have been a sincere seeker.<br /><br />But perhaps the idea of a European actually learning truth from \\"Orientals\\" was too much for the reading public to handle.  Perhaps David-Neel was giving people what they wanted when she wrote about magicians and tricksters and assorted weirdness. Whenever she gets close to her own inner life, she suddenly clams up, saying things like, Whether it is true or not, I can't say, though I have had experiences, but never mind that.<br /><br />In any case, I found the description of the practice of chod deeply moving. It shares characteristics with Christ's experience on Calvary, and only a deep compassion for all beings could impel one to visualize one's whole being being sacrificed for the salvation even of demonic beings. I wish David-Neel could have been a little less ironic and a little more open about her own passion to learn from the lamas.	2005-03-29

Alexandra herself is full of contradictions.  She used people shamelessly, particularly her husband, whom she hardly ever lived with, but from whom she demanded money for decades.  She wandered Asia for 14 years at a go, sending him letters demanding cash throughout the entire period.<br /><br />In addition she picked up a 14 year old Tibetan(Sikkimese) boy as basically a servant, but eventually \\"adopted\\" him as her son.  But she always treated him as a servant, even after she took him back to France with her. She claimed he was a lama, and the book indicates that he was believed to be a tulku (reincarnation), but she still thought of his as \\"her boy\\" when he was in his 40s and 50s. Her egotism was massive, and in her later days she was impossible.<br /><br />At the same time, she claimed to be a practicing Buddhist, but compassion and selflessness are nowhere to be seen. In fact, she was more enamored of the occult side of Tibetan Buddhism than of the compassionate side. (And there is a large occult side!) In her writings she maintains a slightly cynical attitude towards the \\"superstitions\\" of the ordinary Tibetans, but she was more than willing to make use of these superstitions in order to get something she needed out of the poverty-striken folk she met on her treks. She \\"disguised\\" herself as a poor beggar, but in fact, that is what she really was. And she expected to fool people into thinking that she was Tibetan and the mother of her Tibetan \\"son\\" simply by darkening her face and hair. I am sure that anyone with eyes could see that her features were not Tibetan in any way.<br /><br />Nevertheless, one has to admire her determination and her ability to endure all sorts of hardships when she was in her 50s and beyond. One also has to admire her facility in learning to both read and speak Tibetan (along with English and Sanskrit, as well as her native French.) Perhaps her egotism is more notable because she is a woman.  We are used to admiring this kind of ego-driven determination in 19th/early 20th century male \\"explorers.\\" But we see more clearly in a woman how over-powering a person had to be to barge their way into other lands and cultures.<br /><br />The writing of this biography is less than wonderful.

Tad Wise seems likeable enough, except for the fact that he has 3 kids by 3 Moms, and leaves Mom #3 behind with a newborn to go off on this spiritual adventure. So I'm rooting for him to get it right this time and go home and help with the laundry.  And Robert Thurman seems to use Tad as a whipping boy, teasing and taunting him, which doesn't make Thurman exactly shine in my eyes either. The other members of the trek are more or less invisible, though they are mentioned from time to time.<br /><br />The mountain captures my attention starting from the picture on the cover.  It looks extraordinary.  I love Tibet, and this is deepest darkest Tibet for sure. The monasteries have all been trashed and recently rebuilt to attract tourists for China's benefit.  Young Tibetans are as likely to smoke and play pool as they are to chant mantras.  So all the tragedy of Tibet are here to see.<br /><br />The dharma presented here is very Tibetan.  Yamantaka, the fierce deity of death is invoked to stomp on and anhiliate one's self-obsession (the false self). The teaching is called the Blade Wheel of the Mind, and it is meant to work like a buzz-saw, turning all that is self-oriented into dust and all negative experiences into potential gold. To be there, exhausted and suffering from the high elevation, and to listen to these teachings, would probably be an extraordinary retreat experience.  I don't know that it is particularly effective in absentia.  Thurman does come off as a gas-bag.  Maybe it was very unselfish of him, also worn out from trekking all day, to sit down and teach.  Or maybe it was just pedantic of him. His close friendship with the Dalai Lama is name-dropped several times.  I suppose it's relevant, but it also does not really endear him to me.<br /><br />Since I will in all likelihood never even get to Tibet, much less to this remote corner, I enjoyed the vicarious trek.

This analysis of what Christians can learn from Hindus, and conversely what Hindus could learn from Christians is lucid and to the point.  It was redacted from a series of lectures or teachings given by Bede Griffiths at a Catholic setting in the U. S. and thus has the clarity and simplicity of the spoken word.<br /><br />Griffiths' conclusion is that God has revealed Himself truly in the heart and in the cosmos to Hindus, but that there is still something of value in Christianity that cannot be found in Hinduism.<br /><br />This is an excellent primer to Hinduism, as all the sacred Hindu books are briefly explained and all the key concepts of Hinduism are touched upon.  One could read a number of other books and not have as clear a sense of the context of Hindu understanding as he gives here.<br /><br />The fact that his insights are the fruit of 25 years of living out his Christian contemplation in a Hindu context makes his insights very well-balanced.  He recognizes both the obvious and the more subtle weaknesses in Hinduism, and yet he also values it enough to live as a sannyasi in an ashram.<br /><br />Like him, I find that I can understand who Jesus is more clearly when I see him in an eastern context.<br /><br />It is also quite fascinating to see how connected Sanskrit and the western languages are.  The first western scholar who worked on Sanskrit could hardly believe his eyes when it became obvious to him that Sanskrit had ties to Latin and Greek.<br /><br />Yet consider this, which is my own interpretation: the Ancient Sanskrit for God is Dyaus Pita, meaning Sky Father.  We can obviously see that Pita is related to Pater and thus to Father.  But what is Dyaus?  Is not the Latin for God Deus?  (Spanish Dios, Greek Theos)  I don't think I'm imagining things when I see God the Father in the Sanskrit Sky God.<br /><br />We are One at the deepest level, but even on the surface level, we are far more inter-connected than the school books would lead us to believe.

The Dark Night is not just depression, and it is not something that can be avoided or an unfortunate turn of events.  It is the proximate cause of fuller awakening, the process through which the already-spiritualized ego now comes apart, to allow something better to take its place.<br />But the story that follows does not qualify as a true Dark Night, though it was certainly painful and humiliating. The evidence that it is not the death of Harvey's ego is the self-absorbed story of his love for Eryk Hanut.  Yes, it is amazing to fall in love.  And yes, sex with someone you love deeply is awesome. But graphic descriptions of homosexual love are not to everyone's taste (nor would equally graphic descriptions of heeterosexual love seem called for).  And the idea that your love and marriage is a Tantric revelation that is part of God's plan to save the planet is, well, it is ego-inflation, not ego-death.<br />The level of detail here is amazing--every twitch, every conversation, every up and down of the roller-coaster ride of a new love affair, every anxiety attack, every act of vomiting, every kiss--it seems like both spiritual and sexual exhibitionism.<br />If it's true that those who say don't know and those who know don't say, then this book says far too much.<br />I like Harvey, and I am reading his other books, and there is a certain fascination in this close observation of himself.  But I don't think it is a sign of healthy transcendance of the ego-self. (Leaving Mother Meera, though, probably was a wise step. And his warnings about the danger of gurus and the possibility that spiritual powers possessed by humans may be driven by evil is also worth thinking about.)	2004-06-03

After you read this book, you must read The Sun at Midnight, in which Harvey completely renounces what he has so passionately advocated here.  I have the sense that both books are a form of spiritual exhibitionism.  In his later book, he comes to realize how much he was projecting onto Mother Meera.  But even reading this book, the careful reader can see that most of what Ma (as he calls her) says is actually not even said by her.  A typical conversation with her goes something like this:<br />Ma sits and looks at her hands.  Her eyes are aflame.  Her head glows.<br />Andrew says, You want to tell me that I must love you even more.<br />Ma: Yes.<br />Andrew: You want me to know that you have been sent to change the world.<br />Ma: Yes.<br />Well, gee, whose ideas are these anyhow? The projection is there for anyone to see.<br />And so is the narcissim of the author, and if anything, it actually seems to get worse when he renounces Meera.  He seems to think that his suffering because of her demand that he leave his lover is on a par with the crucifixion of Christ.<br />I have tried to winnow the wheat from the chaff in reading Harvey, because he is a skilled writer and also has studied and experienced a great deal of mysticism. What I garner from this book is an imaginative understanding of what it would be like to worship God-made-flesh. The attempt to think that this obviously human person here before me is at one and the same time Divine, an incarnation of God, makes me consider what the 12 apostles might have felt.  Or did they?<br />At the time of his denounciation of Meera, Harvey believed that she had actually been practicing black magic and witchcraft upon him and all her followers.  You won't find any hint of that here, but knowing it as you read will give a different color to everything in the story.	2004-05-30

Her book has both the strengths and the drawbacks of this method.  On the one hand, we follow along with her as she gradually tries to cope with and make sense of what is happening to her.  On the other hand, the journal entries are not dated, and the connecting narrative sometimes makes it a little unclear how much time has passed or what is going on outside the inner self.  The introduction and the concluding chapter, writtem in a more direct style for publication, help to frame the middle chapters and give them more clarity.<br />As a Christian who is drawn to the mystical, I felt I needed to be introduced to kundalini.  Walters certainly gives me a lot to think about.  Her experience is primarily one of bliss.  She attempts to describe as openly as she can her actual experience, and I am left with the understanding that kundalini feels like sexual pleasure transmuted so that it pervades the entire being. It occurs in the head, not as mental images, but as actual sensation.<br />I am attracted to her insistence that the path to awakening is not out of the body but in more fully uniting body and spirit.  This, in my opinion (though not in hers), is in fact what Christianity actually indicates.  She also speaks of the fact that the image of Christ on the cross is the final image that will occur to a Christian being awakened. The lives of the Catholic saints certainly confirms that fact.<br />On the other hand, the fact that Walters is a lesbian, dabbled in the occult, and uses primarily Hindu imagery in her explanations, challenges me.<br />And if synchronicities mean anything, I can't overlook the fact that her initiation began when she was the exact same age as I now am, in the exact same profession, and that she wrote a book on the same author that I wrote my master's thesis on.<br />The bottom line is that I have a better and more positive impression of what kundalini is all about.  And I am left to wonder if the story of Genesis, where a serpent suggests to Adam and Eve that they eat of a forbidden tree and become like gods, is in fact a specific rejection of kundalini by the Hebrews.  Since kundalini (despite the serpent image, which seems male) is considered to me a female power (goddess, even), is it possible that it was rejected in order to allow patriarchy to gain the ascendency?

Who could describe the taste of turtle meat or the feeling of cutting one up, without having experienced it? Every nuance of life as a castaway rings true, and I start to wonder whether the Author's Preface is fact or fiction. And yet at the same time, the story is absolutely fantastic, impossible.<br />The bending of truth and fiction in the end of the book rather stunned me.  And then I had to consider which story was the better one.  And the parallel to believing or not believing in God was obvious.	2003-12-22

That is eons ago in the science of cognition and brain imaging. So I would like to know how the past 2 and a half decades have affected the theories in this book.<br />I also note that the author taught at Princeton University (he died in 1997), so his theories ought to have received a hearing. But apparently the follow-up book he intended was never published, and he was considered somewhat of a maverick, if not quite a crackpot. This website offers some perspective: [...]<br />His theory, in simplest terms, is that until about 3000 years ago, all of humankind basically heard voices. The voices were actually coming from the other side of the brain, but because the two hemispheres were not in communication the way they are now for most of us, the voices seemed to be coming from outside. The seemed, in fact, to be coming from God or the gods.<br />So far, so good. That is certainly imaginable to most of us, because we know that schizophrenics and some others still hear voices in apparently this manner today.<br />But he also posits that many sophisticated civilizations were created by men and women who were all directed by these godlike voices. What is not very clearly explained (a serious gap in his theory) is how all the voices in these &quot;bicameral civilizations,&quot; as he calls them, worked in harmony. But his theory is that ancient Greece, Babylon, Assyria, Egpyt, and less ancient but similar Mayan and Incan kingdoms were all built by people who were not &quot;conscious&quot; in our modern sense.<br />When one hears voices, whether then or now, the voices tend to be commanding and directive, and the need to obey them compelling. Free will is not possible. And so the people who built the pyramids were not self-aware as we are, did not feel self-pity, did not make plans, but simply obeyed the voices, which somehow were in agreement that the thing must be done.<br />Again, when he mentions that hypnosis may be triggering a reversion to a similar kind of consciousness, in which a voice, somehow channeled through the sub-conscious rather than the reasoning part of the brain, has an unusual compelling quality to it, and enables a person to do things that in their conscious analytic mind they are unable to do, we feel that we do have a glimmer that such a state of being is possible.<br />Of course, he connects these ideas to schizophrenia, seeing that as a throw-back to an earlier kind of mind-state, though now socially unacceptable and also unacceptable to its victim, who retains a remembrance of what it was to have control of his or her own mind.<br />He also sees prophets as remnants of the older mind, still able to hear the voices after most people had lost the ability. And he sees idol worship and modern religious behavior as both signs of a longing for the lost certainty and simplicity of a world in which decisions didn't have to be made, and all were of one accord as to what the gods wanted done.<br />I don't see much evidence for the pastoral simplicity which he thinks the bicameral mind lived in. But I do think that it is possible that not only ancient people but even many modern people have mind-experiences that are very different from our individualistic, introspective, self-determined ideas. In fact, I think relatively few human beings question and ponder and change belief systems as we might. The feeling of being adrift in a world that we can't understand, struggling with questions about everything, is far from universal, I think.<br />It is pertinent that he calls the shift from bicameral (two houses) to modern consciousness a &quot;breakdown.&quot; He sees the shift as happening in response to crises and threats in the environment, but he doesn't present it as necessarily positive, and certainly not as pleasant to those living in its shadow. He sees the cries of the Jews and many other people for God to &quot;rend the heavensand come down,&quot; to &quot;not forsake them,&quot; as cried from people who no longer hear the &quot;voices&quot; that seemed to be the gods, and who desperately miss them.<br />In view of individuals such as Mother Teresa, who at one point had a clear inner sense of being directed by God (not necessarily actual auditory voices) and then lost that sense of presence and had to walk blindly thereafter (or silently would be a better metaphor), perhaps we would agree that the experience of the gods or God going silent not only happened at large in human history but is often recapitulated in individuals' personal history as well.<br />If Jaynes is on to something (and I think he is, though I think he may have pushed his &quot;theory of everything&quot; too far and lost scientific credibility), his theory does help us understand why there is a widespread belief that in Biblical times, God interacted with people in a very different way than He does now. The Bible, and other holy books as well, are remnants of a time when human beings own inner sense of right and wrong, clean and unclean, enemy and neighbor, were experienced as coming from outside of them, from disembodied voices that commanded great power. As the mind (or brain) developed, this split healed (or this mind broke down?) and this knowing become a still small voice in many people, and in others a resounding silence.<br />The question remains: should we take the reductionist view, and look at all religious ideas as merely misunderstandings based on schizophrenic-like delusions and hallucinations? Or should we take the view that God, who in times past spoke to us in fire and plague and audible voices (and later in dreams and visions) has now become one with humanity and speaks to us in the silence of our own hearts?<br />A fascinating book, raising as many questions as it answers, but well worth the reading.heavens and come down,&quot; to &quot;not forsake them,&quot; as cried from people who no longer hear the &quot;voices&quot; that seemed to be the gods, and who desperately miss them. <br />In view of individuals such as Mother Teresa, who at one point had a clear inner sense of being directed by God (not necessarily actual auditory voices) and then lost that sense of presence and had to walk blindly thereafter (or silently would be a better metaphor), perhaps we would agree that the experience of the gods or God going silent not only happened at large in human history but is often recapitulated in individuals' personal history as well. <br />If Jaynes is on to something (and I think he is, though I think he may have pushed his &quot;theory of everything&quot; too far and lost scientific credibility), his theory does help us understand why there is a widespread belief that in Biblical times, God interacted with people in a very different way than He does now.

If there's no Jesus, there's obviously no Mary Magdalene or Virgin Mary either. (and no Peter.  But there is a Paul. Odd.)<br />But this book does have some insightful explanations of what I would call mysticism (rather than specifically gnosticism.) And it does suggest some interesting parallels between the Old Testament Jewish story, the story of Jesus, the story of Mithras, and other myths. But the OT and NT seem to much more specifically historical than other &quot;myths.&quot;<br />I find much hard to swallow here--Jesus was first a mythological story later historicized? (doesn't it usually work the other way around?) And the Roman Catholic Church *caused* the Fall of Rome and the Dark Ages by killing all the (wise and gentle) pagans and gnostics?  Um, I know the winners write the history books, but this seems like quite a lump to get down my throat.<br />I will say that I agree with their point that we don't need a goddess now, but an image of God that transcends maleness and femaleness both. But then the goddess remains lost, doesn't she?  So their title is a bit of sensationalizing.	2003-11-09

I know nothing about cryptography or supercomputers, so I can't tell whether there are major or minor inaccuracies in Brown's descriptions of them (though, judging from the reviews, there are.)<br />But I do know  a little bit about Japanese, and in the first few pages of the novel there is a bit about how Becker is decoding into Mandarin Chinese, and suddenly tells them that all the characters he has translated are also part of &quot;Kanji language,&quot; a Japanese writing system, and that in &quot;Kanji language&quot; these Chinese characters have different meanings.  All wrong.  No one calls it &quot;kanji language,&quot; for starters. And characters used in Japanese as kanji (the word means &quot;Chinese characters&quot;) have the same meaning in Japanese as they do in Chinese.  If you had a sequence of kanji, you would be missing a lot of grammar in Japanese, but the meaning would be clear.  It would be like a sequence of nouns and verbs, maybe adjectives. A first year student of Japanese could have explained it to Brown.<br />So when I see a flaw like that on page 9, I wonder how he did with the far more technical stuff.<br />But his plot tricks are clever, and I read the whole thing with a grain of salt and enjoyed the ride.  Not as good as Da Vinci and Angels and Demons; closer to Deception Point.  He's got me hooked on thrillers, however, and now I'll have to find another author to read.	2003-10-19

No matter which of these topics are of interest to you, I think you'll find the linkages the author makes to the wider picture understandable and meaningful. He could have left out a lot of the details about experiments on monkeys, and not lost much. Some of what he says sounds like common sense, so much so that he quotes Schopenauer's dictum that the truth is first reviled, then disputed, and finally embraced as self-evident. The common-sense view that the adult brain can physically change in response to input and mental effort has been anathema in neuro-psychology, apparently.<br />What is most interesting about this book, to me, is the bottom line--that quantum processes control the brain, and that quantum processes mean that physical reality is dependent on mind or consciousness . I think this accords more with universal mysticism than with a fundamentalist view of God creating the universe as external to Himself. In this quantum view, Consciousness not only creates matter but also inheres in it.  Or at least that's where Dr. Schwartz's view leads me.	2003-01-11

What troubled me, though, is that at the end of the book, the scientists who have been described in intimate and friendly detail for their research on creating an animal model of smallpox are then interpreted as having done something fundamentally evil. And they probably have, but nothing in the story-telling up to that point gave any sort of foreboding spin to the work they were doing.<br />A few facts from this book have engraved themselves on my brain: in the last 100 years of its natural existence, smallpox probably killed a billion people.  It is the worst human pathogen, period. It infects only humans. It was eradicated from humans and humanity had the opportunity to destroy it utterly, but some sort of hubris and fear kept us from doing so. Now scientists are playing with it again.<br />Something else occurs to me. The person who spread anthrax in the US last year got his or her supply from within the US research community. Perhaps this person is trying to tell us something about our smallpox supply. Perhaps President Bush knows more about a smallpox danger than he can say. Please God let me be wrong.	2003-01-10

D.is an experimental neurologist who spent several sabbaticals in Japan doing things to cat brains and practicing Zen rather earnestly at the same time, and altogether probably spent 30 or so years sitting Zazen (not only in Japan but wherever he went), experiencing at least one odd physical event, one interesting internal absorption (trance-hallucination, maybe) and one lightning-strike of kensho or wisdom-insight. He does not seem to consider himself to have gotten as far as a state of on-going enlightenment, but he believes that such a state is the result of an accumulation of a series of such kensho experiences.<br />He says that he is not a dualist. But the interesting point is that his monism is purely materialistic. Perhaps not precisely \\"Matter alone is, nothing that is not matter is,\\" but something more like \\"Physical states governed by physical laws alone are, nothing that is not subject to physical laws is.\\" He is the classic man of science. And although he experienced and is describing what most would consider a spiritual insight, he seeks to explain it and value it in biological, physiological, neurological terms, as a rsult of predictable and understandable processes in the brain and nothing else. But his moment of kensho left him so awed that he was tempted to refer it to God. This temptation he overcomes.<br />The odd physical experience he had is recounted in chapter 94 (after a very long prelude!) He heads the chapter with famous lines by p'ang Chi-Shih:<br />How wonderous this, how mysterious!<br />I carry wood, I draw water.<br />And he has spent a lot of time explaining the Zen emphasis on the here and now. Then: One day after 25 minutes of Zazen, he goes in to shave. \\"Suddenly, for the first time ever, I really feel both hands. My tactile sensations are enormously enhanced. Perception increases dramatically on the right hand to the elbow; on the left hand not as strongly and only to the wrist. ONly the sense of touch is enhanced, as it is elicited by the towel in my hands....I still retain all the usual distinctions between myself as subject and towel as object...Astonishing, delicious perception! How much richer than ordinary feeling.\\" After a few seconds, the change fades away. There follows pages of theorizing about what could have happened in the brain to cause such a sensation.<br />Later, an experience during a prolonged sitting in which \\"conscious drops out\\" although he remains erect and awake, and then conscious returns with a hallucinated red maple leaf as the only object in a place entirely black and silent, glistening black and infinitely silent. Then the leaf evaporates, and bliss overwhelms what he calls \\"the experient,' and all sense of space and bodily consciousness is erased temporarily.<br />Finally, 10 years later, a chapter called \\"A Taste of Kensho\\" :<br />\\"It strikes unexpectedly at 9 am on the surface platform of the London subway system. (Due to a mistake)...I wind up at a station where I have never been before....The view is the dingy interior of the station, some grimy buildings, a bit of open sky. Instantly the entire view aquires three qualities: Absolute Reality, Intrinsic Rightness, Ultimate Reflection. With no transition, it is all complete....Yes, there is the paradox of this extraordinary viewing. But there is no viewer. The scene is utterly empty, stripped of every last extension of an I-Me-Mine (his name for ego-self). Vanished in one split second is the familiar sensation that this person is viewing a city scene. The new viewing proceeds impersonally, not pausing to register the paradox that there is no human subject \\"doing\\" it. Three insights penetrate the experient, each conveying Total Understanding at depths far beyond simple knowledge: This is the eternal state of affiars. There is nothing more to do. There is nothing whatever to fear.<br />The result of this kensho is a rather deep re-ordering of the personality, and even some changes in the physical body (the absorption also made physiological changes, but did not re-order the personality much.)<br />His analysis of these events is that they are physiological, measurable states in the brain, and that they \\"etch\\" (his metaphor) the brain, destroying some brain cells and activating other ones, so that an enlightened person is actually a person whose brain has been changed by the physiological process of meditation (and sometimes by other processes, such as drug-induced or naturally occuring lesions of some sort), but meditative processes, though slower, are also more controlled and more likely to be beneficial.<br />His explanation is at odds both with Advaistic mysticism and with theistic dualistic mysticism. But it is also clear that he is describing the same experience that all mystics describe. Although his neurological explanations are novel, his process and product fit quite well in the Zen setting, which is non-theistic and also not particularly \\"spiritual.\\"<br />HIs description of the ongoing state of enlightenment is that after emptying the brain of lots of clutter and junk, including the personal ego, one is able to \\"return to the marketplace with bliss-bestowing hands.\\" This fits with my understanding of Jesus and mystics as well--that having been set free, they now can act compassionately and freely.<br />And the place where enlightenment shows up is in ordinary daily life, which is now lived directly, \\"mindlessly\\" (meaning non-analytically).<br />Although Dr. Austin seem to be saying exact opposite things from most other mystics, they are somehow looking at the same exact elephant from two different sides and describing it differently while still talking about the same thing. My other thought is that what we think about \\"enlightenment\\" doesn't matter at all.

It is called a novel, and yet it doesn't read like a novel at all.  There is an odd turning in on itself, in which the person writing the book describes the person writing the book.  It is either so realistic that it actually makes me think it is real, or else it is actually real and only pretending to be a novel.  Something odd happens to the idea of \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\"  I seem to be struggling to disbelieve, instead. I can't escape from the sneaking suspicion that Margaret Atwood actually wrote this book under a pseudonym.<br />But I see so much of myself in this narrator who drinks her coffee and reads her email and wonders what the hell her life is about.  The comfort of having a companion who just wants to clean the house, take a walk, go shopping, cook, eat, talk, listen--who can't imagine the appeal of that?<br />If you are very devout, you might consider this story an affront.  And if you are stridently skeptical, you might also consider it an affront.  But if you are in-between, somewhat attracted to faith but also somewhat skeptical, this book will suit you.<br />One idea that will linger with me is the question of why Mary hasn't been taken into account by history.  I think of a book I own called The 100 Most Influential Persons in History.  Jesus and Mohammed are in the top 10, but Mary isn't on the list.<br />I found the book puzzling, deceptively simple, and intriguing.	2002-11-16

Thirteen of the enlightened persons in the book were born in the 20th century, and photographs are included of many of them. This in itself helps me overcome the sense that these folks are completely \\"other.\\"<br />The stories of enlightenment cover as wide a spectrum as you could imagine, from 16 year old boys in India who suddenly attained enlightenment, to middle age businessmen, to the very troubling story of Suzanne Segal, a young pregnant women whose mind suddenly disengaged from her body one day as she stepped onto a bus.  For some, their experience was the culmination of a long-sought spiritual release.  For others, it was spontaneous and not entirely pleasant.<br />The absence of Jesus in this book is regretable, but perhaps the lack of any first-hand account of His experience excuses that (though I think John 14-17 would have made a nice addition). Several Christian mystics are included however.<br />Apart from the absence of Jesus, the editorial choices are excellent.  The editorial comments, however, leave something to be desired.  Often the little introductory blurb simply pre-tells the story that is told quite clearly in the excerpt to follow. There's no point in quoting what someone is about to say!  In general, however, enough biographical information is provided to place the writings of each enlightened person in context.<br />If you have read (or experienced) some mysticism and wonder where this is all going or how enlightenment actually comes about, this book is for you. If you want a theoretical or philosophic introduction to mysticism, look elsewhere.  For me, this book was very-- well pardon the pun, but very enlightening! The variety or paths and yet the commonality of experience does lead to some conclusions.  The honesty in including some experiences that were not all sweetness and light is also important.<br />The authors deliver exactly what they promise: descriptions of enlightenment itself, told by those who have lived it.htenment itself, told by those who have lived it.	2002-07-17

But that is a small percentage of the book.  His overview of how mysticim figures in the world's religions is also of interest, particularly if you are not very familiar with Hinduism. But apart from Hindu and Christian, he seems to be looking at everything else from quite a distance, so that we never get much of a feel for what Jewish or Islamic mysticism look or feel like.<br />His description of the natural mysticism of American Indians works well only because he never goes into any depth or details. He can talk lightly on one page about harm no sentient life, and then on the next page extol American Indians as paragons of virtue, with no comment on the fact that they were hunters and warriors for the most part.<br /><br />My main complaint is that he seems overly-impressed with the ability of the group that he's a part of (Parliament of World Religions) to change the world. A United Nations-type committee to bring about world mystical harmony is more or less absurd to my mind.<br /><br />Teasdale gives us too many generalities and too many lists of virtues and guidelines. There is a sermonizing quality to much of what he says, a desire to be moralize.<br /><br />Also, his bottom line seemed to be that Christian mysticism leads to union with Love itself, while some other forms of mysticism lead to a state that is compassionate and blissful but may also be experienced as Void. To me this indicates that Christianity is a step beyond earlier mystic insights (although it has not done as well in leading people to follow Christ to this end-point).  But Teasdale seems far more critical of Christianity than he does of Hinduism and other traditions.  He says, for example, \\"Christian mysticism has always rejected the body, as evidenced by the extreme asceticism of Francis of Assisi.  He spent a good deal of time fasting, sometimes praying all night on his knees.  His poor body was a victim of his piety!....The East has its equivalent ascetical hardships on the body, but has also managed to understand that the body can be beneficial to the spiritual journey.\\"<br />Well, Francis of Assisi may have been hard on his body, but praying all night on your knees is nothing compared to the extreme ascetical practices still followed in Hinduism, where men spend years with one arm held over their heads or standing on their feet day and night for years. And it is simply untrue that Christian mysticism as a whole flatly rejects the body.  The Mystical Marriage, with its erotic overtones, is the primary Christian mystical metaphor.<br />F. C. Happold's book entitled Mysticism is superior to Teasdale's in allowing the mystic traditions to speak for themselves and also in providing a framework for understanding what they have to say. Another  book called Mystics, Masters, Saints and Sages also is more valuable in actually allowing mystics of various traditions and no traditions at all to speak of their vision.<br />One other complaint: Teasdale's question about psycho-active drugs/plants is worth raising, but his answer misses the point. If a state of mind similar to a mystical state can be induced by peyote, for example, the question is: doesn't this suggest that mystical states are physiologically caused? He never confronts this question.East has its equivalent ascetical hardships on the body, but has also managed to understand that the body can be beneficial to the spiritual journey.\\" <br />Well, Francis of Assisi may have been hard on his body, but praying all night on your knees is nothing compared to the extreme ascetical practices still followed in Hinduism, where men spend years with one arm held over their heads or standing on their feet day and night for years.

In addition to giving us a detailed biography of Nash, Nasar also creates a vivid picture of the rarefied academic atmosphere at Princeton, MIT and the Institute for Advanced Studies. She captures the feeling of the times, from the immediate post-war era through the Cold War years and McCarthyism. The reader is led to consider questions of sexuality, morality, genius, madness and human nature, as well as game theory and mathematics.<br />In response to another reviewer's question about something puzzling in the writing, the problem may lie in the way chapters open. In some cases, a chapter seems to begin with an anecdote that is meant to give an overview, a kind of generalization, and then the story backtracks and leads up to that incident. It's a common enough technique, but in places I found it awkwardly handled. But for the most part I found her writing elegant and clear and the incorporation of multiple sources very skillfully done.<br />One other thought that strikes me is that the possibility of reconstructing someone's life in such detail is interesting in itself. Suppose your life was thought to be of interest to others; could a good researcher put together a biography of you that was far more clear and detailed than even your own memory of it?<br />If you are interested in math, or psychology, or feminism, or history, or economics, or just humanity, you will find value in this book.<br />(PS: I just read about Asperger's Syndrome and am inclined to wonder whether this may account for Nash's peculiar behavior prior to his descent into schizophrenia.  Nash's apparent arrogance and cruelty may be the result of an inability to understand human interaction, I could speculate.)	2002-07-11

If you've read other editions, I think you'll like this translation.<br />Julian of Norwich wrote her revelations in Middle English, and is perhaps the first woman ever to write a book in the English language.  Because Middle English is fairly accessible, what is needed is not so much a translation as a re-casting into modern English. John Skinner does a masterful job of retaining Julian's voice and brings many of her terms over into modern English.  Rather than supply the Latinized &quot;union with God&quot; (or even more abstract sounding &quot;divine union&quot;) he keeps Julian's own words &quot;our oneing with God,&quot; as he does with words such as &quot;again-making&quot; and &quot;dear-worthy&quot; giving a strong sense of actually hearing Julian's own voice.<br />And what a lovely voice it is.  Her language is, as she would say, &quot;homely and courteous,&quot; simple yet refined and elegant. Her mind is clear, honest, intelligent, and wise. Although she is often termed a &quot;visionary,&quot; the visions that she spent her life pondering happened in a single day.  In fact, what she experienced is what modern people would call a &quot;near-death experience.&quot; As she lay in a state somewhere between life and death, she saw a series of visions, beginning with an image of Jesus dying slowly on the cross.  In my first approach to her writings, I was somewhat put off by the Medieval-ness of what she saw. But, like Julian herself, I needed to press through the first impression, and seek for the meaning that she drew from what she saw.<br />What most endears Julian to me is that she thinks. First of all, she admits that after regaining normal consciousness, she said of her visions, &quot;I raved,&quot; meaning that she dismissed what she had seen as merely delirium.  But in some manner the visions were repeated, and she realized that she was in danger of dismissing a spiritual experience of great depth and meaning.  Julian then reflected on the meaning of what she had seen for the rest of her life. These &quot;showings&quot; became the basis for continuing spiritual insight, as she wrestled with the symbolism, the conflict they presented to accepted doctrine, and the need to understand what she had experienced so vividly.<br />Julian goes back to God again and again, asking questions, asking for understanding, wanting &quot;with all her might&quot; as she says, to know the truth. And God most courteously deepens her understanding. But not everything can be known or said.<br />Her parable of the lord and the servant opens up a view of Original Sin that turns that doctrine from a stumbling block to a source of comfort. She also sees the Trinity as ultimately including &quot;all who will be saved,&quot; which is her way of saying (without quite saying) all of humanity.<br />It is fascinating to see Julians's mind and spirit deal with the fact that when she was face to face with God, she could not see the existence of sin. She debates within herself, and with God, asking, Is it not a fact that we are all sinners?  The church teaches it and experience proves it. She feels torn between what she believes, and what God now showed her. And with all her mind and all her spirit, she seeks a way to reconcile the conflict. In the end, she comes to a view of sin that, if we could all catch her vision, would be the means of making all things well, as God promised her.<br />God's love for humanity pervades Julian's thought and her very words seem to me to be full of light and grace.<br />Skinner uses footnotes sparingly, although some of the footnotes he does include are cryptic and confusing. His glossary is very helpful in understanding Julian's language and thought.  But in one key term, there is, I believe a punctuation mistake which alters the meaning that I think the translator intends:  &quot;sensuality: the sinful side of kind, that is, being transformed by the workings of mercy and grace.&quot;  If we remove the two commas, the definition makes more sense.  But I question whether Julian sees our &quot;sensuality&quot; (our sense-knowledge of ourselves, I think she means) as the sinful side of our nature (kind = nature, as in mankind.) Sensual knowledge is inadequate, true; but to read &quot;sinful&quot; into it, after all she has said about God not seeing sin in us, strikes me as wrong. This term &quot;sensuality&quot; is significant in understanding her work, so I would ask other readers to consider for yourself what she means by it.<br />But I cannot end this review on a negative note, so I will end by quoting her own conclusion:<br />&quot;I often desired to know our Lord's meaning (in giving me these showings. ) And fifteen years and more after, I was answered in spiritual understanding, with this saying: 'Would you know your Lord's meaning in this thing? Know it well:love was his meaning.  Who showed you? Love. What did he show you? Love. Wherefore did he show it you? For love. Hold yourself therein and you shall know and learn more in the same; but you will never know nor learn another thing therein without end.' Thus was I taught that love was our Lord's meaning.  And I saw full surely in this and in all that before God made us he loved us; which love was never slaked, nor never shall be.&quot;nsformed by the workings of mercy and grace.&quot;  If we remove the two commas, the definition makes more sense.

True, notes on the parsing of each word would be useful too,  but would probably mess up the clarity of the page.  Guess we'll just have  to actually study some Greek, if we want to know everything.  But with some  basic study of Greek (in the regretably unavailable book by Jim Found,  Basic Greek in 30 minutes a day, I am able to look for myself at the Greek  text and see exactly how the sentences are put together, the literal  meaning of the Greek, and the translation choices that the NKJV has made.  This book is well worth owning for anyone who wants to be able to think for  themselves about the New Testament.  And that is well worth thinking about!	1999-07-20
