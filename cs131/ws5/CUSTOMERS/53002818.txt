This book (the 2002 edition) was the only tour book in my backpack.  I used it both while planning the trip and throughout the trip itself.<br />Rick gives you the important information about city covered.  This information usually includes major attractions, hotels, restaurants and basic &quot;getting around&quot; information.  For the most part, I competely agreed with his reviews of the major attractions.  His hotel selections also worked out well, but I didn't use the restaurant information much at all.<br />The major downside is that the information isn't always that well organized.  He will pack a lot of information about a hotel into a paragraph, but if you are skimming the book it is difficult to pick out the important tidbits.  I would rather see the key information more clearly presented than buried in a paragraph.  Also, his maps weren't very helpful at all.  In every city I ended up picking up a local tourist map rather than using the little hand sketches in the book.	2003-09-21

He manages to capture complexities of enterprise class application development in a simple, easy to read book.<br />If you've read any of Fowler's other titles, the structure of this one will come as no surprise.  The first have of the book discusses the patterns in &quot;narrative&quot; format, and the second half presents them in reference format.  If you are new to this subject, I highly recommend reading through the narrative section to understand how the patterns fit together.<br />If you've been involved in enterprise application development before, chances are you can simply flip to the second half of the book and start skimming the patterns.  Each is only a handful of pages long and is accompanied by a description, use cases and example code.<br />Like other &quot;patterns&quot; titles, if you've been doing software development for a while you'll read the patterns and think &quot;oh.. of course, I did that in xyz project&quot;.  The patterns themselves may not be groundbreaking and chances are you've seen them in some form, but having a well documented reference of them nearby will be an asset to any software development effort.	2003-05-01

These are easy to overlook, but will make all of the difference in the world on a long ride.<br />It then spends some time overviewing a good training program.  Like other cycling books, the authors recommend picking up a heart rate monitor and using it for the basis of your training.  They provide training programs for different goal distances (such as your first century) that recommend spending time in different heart rate zones.  The training and nutrition information is well done, but not amazingly in depth.  If you get more serious about the sport, you'll probably want more information, but this book hits is target audience just fine.<br />The later chapters of the book cover all of the unpleasantries that come up during a long ride: sores, pain, general discomfort.  Again, this information is invaluable during a long ride.<br />All in all, the authors have done a great job at putting together the information you need to complete your first (or next!) long distance bike ride.	2003-05-01

What are the rules for determining if a default constructor is provided.  This book will answer those questions and more.<br />The C++ Object Model gets to the &quot;how&quot; of C++.  It covers the details of how virtually (ha!) every language features is implemented and what rules a compiler uses to make decisions.<br />This book is not an easy read.  You need to be very comfortable with C++ and be willing to work through lots of code.  The explanations are ok, but could be a bit much if you aren't familiar with the full C++ lexicon.  That said, if you want to take you C++ knowledge to a new level, this book is the ticket.  There is nothing else like it available.	2003-05-01

This one is a must have for your software development bookshelf.<br />I user several STL books regularly and none of them have come close to giving me the in depth understanding that this book has.  Sure, others are better references, beginner guides, etc.. but if you really want to understand what is going on under the covers and how to write -good- STL, this book is your answer.  I have seen suggestions from this book result in massive performance improvements in naively written STL code.<br />Enough said, go pick up a copy .. :)	2002-10-30

For about [price] and the price of some tools you'll be able to perform the most common maintenance on your bike yourself.  Not only will this save you money (tuneups aren't exactly cheap these days), but you'll understand your equipment much better and be able to handle unexpected situations on the trail.<br />The book is a large format with two columns of text per page and hand drawn figures (basically no photos).  Each part of the bike is covered in great depth in pseudo-outline form.<br />The only downside is that the figures can be a bit difficult to understand.  I can see how they can be more clear that photos, but some combination of the two or perhaps just more figures would have helped.  I've found it is always best to look at the figures alongside my bike so there is no ambiguity.	2002-08-01

It will open your eyes to what generic programming really is and how it can be done with C++.<br />As another review states, \\"this book is mostly about templates\\".  Certainly true.  This book takes templates where few have dared venture.  Rather than use templates as a glorifed macro system, Alexandrescu uses templates to define small code generation engines.  Your knowledge of C++ will most certainly be expanded, but you'll also come away from this book with a different way of looking at programming problems.<br />The book also picks apart many popular design patterns and shows how to implement them in very generic ways.  Alexandrescu's treatment of certain patterns is so thorough that you'll understand the pattern better from this book than the original.<br />Perhaps the techniques go too far, perhaps there is a limit to how generic one should go.  That is yours to decide, but this book is definitely a keeper for the C++/software development bookshelf.	2002-08-01

Washington (America by Mountain Bike Series)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good coverage of the major trails across the state	If you're going to be mountain biking in Washington, this should probably be one of the first trail guides in your collection.  It covers almost 90 of the major rides all over the state.<br />Each ride is accompanied by an &quot;at a glance&quot; section that will give you basic overview of the ride as well as good maps and very complete writeups.  I've never had a problem finding a trail (or finding my way on a trail) and generally agree with all of the comments written about the trails.  I just wish the trails had estimated driving times from major areas.<br />The front of the book also has all of the trails categorized by &quot;type&quot;.  So, if you're a single track person, just find the list of single track trails and off you go.<br />If you're planning on riding in a specific region (such as the Seattle area), I'd recommend picking up a book specific to the region as this doesn't cover all of the local trails.	2002-08-01

While this title probably won't help your development skill, it provides a great deal of insight into the design of C++.  Parts of C++ may seem a bit odd (crufty, overly complex, however you want to think of it).  In this book Stroustrup clearly explains the motivations and tradeoffs that went into every feature of the language.  While you may not agree with the decisions, understanding the thought process behind them is incredibly interesting and will give you a better appreciation for the language.	2002-07-25

With many years in the industry, his thoughts are worth consideration.<br />The book starts off with a rather harsh critique of Dan Rather, or &quot;The Dan&quot; as Goldberg calls him.  At first it almost seems like a personal attack on Dan Rather (which is quite funny), but he eventually lets up and gets on with the book.<br />He touches on how the media portrays homelessness, AIDS and even September 11th.  The information presented seems somewhat well balanced, but his strong opinions hang over any balance that is presented.<br />Without question, Goldberg is strongly opinionated and writes with his own biases, but the book is still worth reading.  Even if some of his views are on the extreme side, he brings up many good points of discussion and will certainly get you thinking about the news industry.	2002-03-20

It begins with the origins of Linux and plenty of dwelling on Linus' lack of a social life (too much, actually).  From there, Linus chronicles the surge in the popularity of Linux and the changes it caused in his life.  Nothing particularly &quot;revolutionary&quot; is covered, but it is an interesting story nonetheless.<br />Linus comes across just as you would expect, somewhat arrogant and very direct.  He says exactly what is on his mind and doesn't make any excuses.  Yep, Linus is the same person he has been since the beginning. :)<br />On the downside, the book has several chapters of commentary by David Diamond that essentially document the &quot;making of&quot; this book.  They are probably there to add some color, but I don't think they add anything.	2002-02-22

Unfortunately I did this and missed out on a great book for too long.  Franky, this thing looks like a text book... not something that would be an easy, enjoyable ready.  However, this is exactly what it is.<br />Fowler's conversational style keeps the book moving and very enjoyable.  He opens with a refactoring walkthrough that introduces you to the general concepts.  After this the book catalogs all of the refactoring methods and really becomes more of a reference.  In about 30 minutes you can read the first few chapters and come away with a good appreciation for the book.<br />If you've been programming for a while you'll probably find that you were already performing many of the refactorings.  This book takes what you've been doing intuitively and formalizes it, much like Design Patterns.<br />Those that are new to programming might find the book a bit confusing since many of the refactoring methods are opposites of each other.  Experience really drives the decision of which refactoring to use.  That said, Fowler does a good job of stating the intentions behind each and providing good examples (all in Java, but simple enough to be understandable even if you aren't familiar with the language).	2002-01-31

For people that are just looking to get an idea of what the field is about, this book will provide the answers in an accessible manner.<br />The book beings with a compelling look at the way ant colonies function and uses this as a foundation for the ideas of emergence.  Along the way he looks at several examples of emergence, including cities and software.  He also touches on (or alludes to) current research areas such as genetic algorithms and pattern recognitition.<br />As someone who studied computer science I felt the book was a bit too light and missed some great opportunities to dig, at least a bit, into greater detail.  However, I think many people will find this an approachable, enjoyable read.	2002-01-22

It opens with the basics of ab anatomy and then moves in to various exercises and programs for strengthening and developing the abdominals.  Only at the end does it stray slightly off course and discuss the nutritional aspects of ab development.<br />The one area where this book stands out (and my reason for purchasing it a while back) is that it focusses on the pelvic tilt associated with improper ab development.  For about $... it might be worth it just for this information.<br />The downside is that this book is out of date.  Swiss balls are the current rage in ab developed and the book author has titles devoted entirely to this subject, yet they aren't mentioned once.	2002-01-07

Neither are convered in extreme detail, but that isn't bad.  In fact, it makes this book an enjoyable casual read.<br />The game theory pieces are presented at a very approachable level of detail.  No rigorous math, just well written descriptions of the basic concepts.<br />The first part of the book covers the development of game theory and provides good &quot;character development&quot; of von Neumann.  It them moves away from von Neumann and into the politics of the time (which are exceptionally interesting, especially if you didn't live through them).<br />Overall I found the book very interesting.  It manages to balance several topics without wandering and going into excessive detail.	2002-01-03

I thought the book would mostly cover the nutrition of fast food but actually spend a significant amount of time on the business practices of fast food companies and their related industries (such as meat packing, etc). Regardless, the book was a great read that I couldn't put down.<br />Schlosser uses many first hand accounts and stories to give context to the information presented. At first this seems somewhat biased as most of the stories come from the &quot;little guy&quot; (fast food franchise owners, ranchers, etc), but is pretty well balanced with the opinions of &quot;big business&quot;. The stories provide an interesting history of the industry and help put a face on many of some of the more significant players.<br />Personally, I found the most disturbing part of the book to be the business practices of companies in the fast food and meat packing industries. The nutrition aspect wasn't too much of a surprise since restaurants make that information available. Overall, it has significantly changed my view of the fast food industry.	2001-11-27

This title has been sitting on my shelf for years, but for some reason I decided to start flipping through it the other day.  It's sad to admit this, but I couldn't put it down!  I really wish I had taken the time to read this years ago.<br />In a reasonably short title, this book covers more about the nooks and crannies of C than almost any other book I have come across -- and does it in a way that keeps the reader's attention.  Subtle aspects of the language are presented in detail and accompanied by interesting stories and suggestions (called &quot;Handy Heuristics&quot; in the book) for improving your own code.<br />The book then steps a bit outside of the language to explain (briefly) how linkers work and how executable are structured.  This information helps to round out the language specific material and is something you won't find in too many other places.<br />The only downside to this title is that the information is probably a bit dated and somewhat Sun specific.  However, I wouldn't let either of these items prevent you from adding this to your software development collection.	2001-10-24

The story follows a physicist that &quot;accidentally&quot; creates a universe in a laboratory.  Benford keeps the story moving by following the development of this universe and exploring how it is viewed from many different angles, including law, religion and politics.  Personally I enjoyed just finding out what was happening to the universe itself, but the other angles really added depth to the story.  I must say that he paints a pretty bleak picture of academic physics...  this certainly won't serve as a good recruiting tool for academia.. :)<br />Others reviews have suggested the character development isn't very good.  I would buy that, though I didn't get that impression while I was reading the book.  I'm sure the character development could be better, but I found the book very enjoyable regardless.	2001-07-24

Forward makes some powerful statements (sometimes rather amusing) about humanity.  During the development of the cheela (the lifeforms on the surface of the neutron star) he frequently pokes fun at humanity.  For example, the development of cheela religion is a well done jab at our society.<br />Personally I thought the book spent too much time developing the cheela and not enough time getting the reader familiar with the humans hovering above the star.  You don't really learn much about the humans until very late in the book.  I guess I was hoping to know more about them, their motives, etc.  All in all it was a very worthwhile read.	2001-06-19

It leaves you seeing the world very differently, realizing you don't have control over nearly as much as you think you do.<br />The first hundred (or so) pages of the book don't mention conciousness at all.  Instead they take you through a tour of how different fields deal with the notions of information, complexity and order.  These are all woven together as the discussion of how our conciousness works begins.<br />As the book progresses the author spends some time on philosophical issues, which seems to come out of left field but are actually very interesting.  For example, he spends some time look at how the current views of conciousness apply to religion.<br />Other reviews have mentioned that the material in this book is nothing new.  Perhaps this is true.  If you have done other reading in this area this book may be of less interest.  However, if you're new to this area (as I was), this book provides a very thorough foundation of current thought.	2001-05-25

The book starts off with an introduction to KDE and then moves into examples of QT programming (the toolkit KDE uses).  From there it takes you into developing actual KDE applications.  The example code and topics covered provide a tour of the KDE codebase and functionality available.<br />You will come away from this book understanding the general architecture of KDE, but there will still be long way to go before you really understand the internals of the system.  The book is an overview at best.  It isn't a reference and doesn't cover details of the KDE (or QT) libraries.  After reading this you'll have enough information to start dabbling in KDE development but you'll probably find yourself sifting through lots of reference material.<br />The major downside to the book are all of the errors and inconsistencies in the code samples.  Many of the examples contain syntax errors or don't work because the libraries have changed.  This can make going through the examples frustrating, but on the upside, if you're willing to work through the problems you'll probably learn quite a bit.<br />It is clear that different authors worked on the book because language and code style different among chapters.  I think this one could have used one more pass through editing.<br />I will give the book credit though, it makes a very good attempt at hitting a moving target.  Since KDE is rapidly advancing it is hard to expect a book to get every fact correct and ensure that all of the code will compile.  This book makes up for that through its online version at Andamooka.  Here you will find fixes and discussion around each part of the book.  I have been very impressed with the devotion of David Sweet.  Whenever I have posted a question to Andamooka it is answered quickly and he is usually the first to respond.  Having this resource greatly increases the value of the book.	2001-05-15

Each package is presented with an overview of it's features, a dicussion of the package options and examples of using the package.  In most cases, there are nice examples of how to use (and extend) the package programmatically (using Visual Basic).<br />The book is useful beyond learning about DTS because it explains how to use DTS effectively.  The book frequently comments on performance implications of certain features and gives the tradeoffs between certain packages.<br />If there is a downside, it is that the book doesn't cover the DTS object model too well.  The code examples are very good, but if you want to delve deeper you'll find yourself sifting through the DTS online documentation.  However, I'm not sure this is a downside.  Leaving this information out allows the book to stay on topic without drifting off into reference material.<br />Overall a very good both for those looking to learn about DTS and use it effectively.	2001-05-14

It starts with a quick introduction to data warehousing (without resorting to giving an entire history of the subject, as seems so common today) and how it relates to OLAP and then moves right into the Analysis Servies tools.<br />The chapters are well written and get you the information you need, without missing any major details.  Even if you don't plan to take the &quot;step by step&quot; approach, this book is worth having by your side.<br />All right... now for the downsides.  At best this book is good for beginners.  These are some of the areas where I found it came up short:<br />- Sizing systems that will support Analysis Services.  The book talks a bit about how big cubes are, but there is no information about cube performance/cube sizing, etc.  Basically, this book won't help you develop a hardware plan for hosting Analysis Services.<br />- Accessing Analysis Services via the web.  All of Microsoft's literature talks about how SQL Server 2000's great support for the web/XML.  Strangely, it is very hard to find this information for Analysis Services, and this book doesn't provide any guidance.  Right now it seems that the best you can do to find this information is hunt around Microsoft's site.<br />Overall I still think this is good book.  However, if you are going to be building a large Analysis Services system, expect to be looking for other sources to answer all of your questions.	2001-04-18

Underhill goes over the behaviors people exhibit while they are shopping and points out how retailers do things both correctly and incorrectly.  His conclusions are based on years of observational research.<br />The book is written in a light, conversational manner that makes it a quick, easy read.  However, it excludes an enormous amount of detail about Underhill's research.  The book makes references to his research over the years, but does it at such a high level that it is difficult to fully buy into his argument.  I want to believe what he says, but he just doesn't provide the necessary level of detail.<br />He also seems to draw conclusions that just can't be made (based on the information he presents).  For example, he will relate a story of how a particular rack was being used in a store and then say &quot;obviously it should have been placed like this..  and after the store took my recommendation the items on the rack sold much better...&quot;.  He doesn't account for other factors that could have caused better performance -- such as seasonal effects, etc.  One could assume he controlled for all of these things, but it isn't stated in his discussion.<br />Also, he tends to go on rants about the way stores should be and offers all kinds of suggestions about his view of the world.  Great.. amusing at first, but they get a little tiring.<br />Finally, I don't agree with his assessment of online shopping (note, I am biased on this one).  He takes his observations about shopping and applies them to the online environment when it isn't clear this is a reasonable thing to do.  Some of his points are good, but in general they are very near sighted.<br />All criticism aside, I think Why We Buy is a worthwhile read.  Just set your &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; threshold higher while you are reading it.	2001-04-13

Christensen's discussion focusses on the disk drive industry, but includes examples from other industries as well (such as the American steel industry).  The core of his argument is that established companies will choose to invest their resources in &quot;sustaining technologies&quot; that are basically improvements on their existing products.  These companies will often be some of the first to experiment with disruptive technologies, but their customers don't demand these technologies and the company doesn't see a good enough opportunity to invest in them.<br />The book provides a good amount of detail - enough to get you to buy into his argument without becoming difficult to read.<br />Overall, a fascinating topic presented in a quick, easy read.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-12

However, it is a well written book that provides solid all around advice for the new investor.<br />The book touches on many aspects of investing without being biased toward any particular one.  It basically gives an overviews of many of the tools available to make investing decisions and leaves it to the reader to choose and learn more.  For example, it starts out with an overview of economic factors and then moves into fundamental analysis, charting and buy/sell guidelines.  It then touches on options, IPO's and tax issues.<br />Compared to other &quot;newbie&quot; books such as those by the Motley Fool, I think this offers a much more rounded approach.  These books (and others) tend to present a biased view of the &quot;correct&quot; way to invest.  This book gives a broader view that gives the reader more starting points to continue their learning and ultimately make better investing decisions.<br />One final comment -- there is not a lot of advertising for the thestreet.com in this book.  Many chapters are accompanied by lists of websites to help you explore the topic presented in the chapter.  Naturally, thestreet.com is often in the list, but all websites are given very fair treatment throughout the book.	2001-02-27

Each interview is at most a couple of pages long and is accompanied by beautiful pictures as well as supplementary commentary by the interviewers.  The interviews themselves are pretty lightweight.  You'll get some idea of what people are working on in the field, but don't expect anything in depth.  Overall the book is a good, lightweight read.  You can pick it up and read an interview or two and then not touch it for a couple of days.  Some reviews have suggested this is a bad thing, but I think it is exactly what the book intends to provide.The book itself is rather large and contains beautiful photographs that have an artistic element to them.  This adds to the browseability of the book and makes it something you might want to leave out for others.	2001-01-17

The first half of the book covers the basics of photography including cameras, film, lenses and light.  Each of the chapters is concise and contains handy tables and charts.  For example, the chapter on filters has handy charts to help you determine when to use certain filter types.<br />The second half of the book contains chapters devoted to various subjects.  Some examples are landscapes, weather and people.  In between some of the chapters are small sections on National Geographic photographers that give a short bio and their options on photographing the subject being discussed.  While these sections don't provide much in the way of additional information, they make for interesting reading and add character to the book.<br />Beyond the written content, the book itself is a work of art.  It is filled with beautiful pictures that are great examples of the topic being discussed.  Also, it is printed on glossy paper that adds that extra touch of professionalism.

The Last Three Minutes is certainly not a let down.  It explores several possible fates for our universe, presenting the information in easily understandable form.  The book wanders from science to philosophy as Davies first presents (at a very high level) the physics behind the possible fates of the universe and then goes on to consider how beings living at the end of the universe might be able to survive.  At first I found these transitions a surprise and thought he had strayed off topic, but I ultimately ended up enjoying thinking about these conjectures.<br />The only criticism I have about the book is the material is sometimes lacking supporting detail.  I'd like to have more information about the theories that were being discussed.<br />Another problem, though clearly not the author's fault, is that some of the material is outdated.  If you are interested the current state of the physics discussed in this book I'd recommend checking out Brian Greene's &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot;.	2000-12-08

The problem itself was somewhat interesting to me, but I hoped Singh presentation of the story would be as good as &quot;The Code Book&quot;.  I wasn't disappointed.  The solution to the problem is wrapped in a compelling story that takes you through the history of mathematics, starting before Fermat's time.  Along the way Singh takes time to point out both the highlights and tragedies of mathematics, while weaving in elements of Andrew Wiles' life.<br />While the math behind the final solution to be problem may be out of reach for most people, Singh successfully communicates the essence of the mathematics used.  The book is not complex or saturated with equations and is accessible to just about anyone.  For those more interested in the mathematics, Singh includes a complete set of appendices containing problems and proofs from each era of mathematics he discusses.<br />All in all, a great read.  Highly recommended.	2000-11-18

When I started reading it I was impressed.  The book is well put together (the book is one giant outline) and very detailed.  However, as I continued I wondered where the research was to back up everything McRobert was saying.  The book seems to be about his personal experience with weight training and how he would do it differently if he could do it again.  That's great, but it purely annecdotal and can't be applied to the general weight training population.<br />Another thing that took me back about the book was in the introduction.  He basically warns you that this book is so detailed and deep that you'll have to read it a couple of times to get the full meaning.  I found this judgement of his readers to be a bit insulting.  I have yet to see a textbook with such a warning and there are much more difficult topics out there.<br />All in all it was an interesting read.  I can't say the program doesn't work or isn't worth trying, but given it's lack of research I would be incline to look elsewhere for a training program.	2000-11-13

The writing style is  very accessible and the authors clearly discuss the diferences between  trading and investing.  In this respect, it met my expectations.  However,  I felt that the book was nothing more than a set of &quot;rules of  thumb&quot; that were cobbled together in a book.  I certainly enjoyed the  read, but the lack of well defined rules makes me reluctant to try the  methods discussed.  I was even more disappointed to find that the authors  mention that these methods are &quot;statistically proven&quot;, but never  present any of these proofs.  If you are interested in learning more about  trading this book might be worth a quick read, but I'd recommend finding  something more technical if you really want to take a quantitative approach  to trading.	2000-08-29

Now that I've had it for a while I really believe it is a fantastic  reference guide and one of the most complete bodybuilding books around.  It  covers virtually every exercise you can think of in great detail -- how to  perform the exercise, which part of the muscle is used, etc.  Beyond this  it contains a wealth of information about designing training programs for  different body types and skill levels and how to prepare to be a  competitive bodybuilder.<br />I still question some of the training schedules  (lifting 6 days per week really seems like a lot to me), but it is worth  the money just as an exercise reference -- even if you aren't interesting  in competitive bodybuilding.  Whenever I am changing my training program or  looking to verify my form I consult this book.	2000-08-29

The book is a series of &quot;Items&quot; (in the same style as Effective C++) that are each a tip about how to use Perl.   Each tip is accompanied by a detailed description that discusses the pros  and cons or each tip and several examples. The tips are then arranged into  sections such as &quot;Regular Expressions&quot; and &quot;Object Oriented  Programming&quot;.  In a relatively small book the authors manage to  present an enormous amount of helpful information.<br />This book is a  worthwhile purchase if you are a new or intermediate Perl developer.  The  tips presented here will really help improve your code.  However, if you  have been working with Perl for a while then this book isn't worth the  money.  There might be a tip or two that you don't know, but chances are  you know most of what is presented.	2000-07-28

Books	3	12	14	N	N	Pretty good guide, but has some downsides	Overall this book is well put together.  The hikes are organized according to their location in the park so you can quickly find hikes that are close  the entrace you are using.  The descriptions of each hike are clear and and  easy to follow and include a small map of the hike with the description.   Each hike is accompanied by color photos which really set this book apart.   This is a worthwhile purchase, but it has a couple of downsides:<br />- None  of the trails are rated.  I really enjoy guides that rate each hike and  define their rating system (such as the &quot;Don't Waste Your Time&quot;  series) so I can quickly determine what the authors really thought of the  hike.  When I picked up this book to quickly find a hike to do the next  morning I had a hard time figuring out which hikes would be most  worthwhile.  I ended up picking one close to the entrace I was using since  that is how the book is organized.<br />- The maps included with each hike  could be more detailed.  Having the maps is nice but they aren't very  helpful in pinpointing your location on a trail or knowing that the  upcoming terrain is going to be like.  A full topographical map would be  ideal.<br />- It would be nice if each hike had an area for writing notes.	2000-07-25

Since I've been involved in weight lifting I have tried to read as much as possible about various diet methods.  When low-carb diets became popular I was skeptical,  but wanted to learn more.  I read through the material I could find online  and just finished &quot;The Greenwich Diet&quot;.  In all cases I found  myself totally unsatisfied with everything I read.  Every book pitched it's  particular take on the low carb diet as a miracle cure and didn't provide  much information about what was really happening to your body.  I decided  to give &quot;The Ketogenic Diet&quot; a try and was stunned -- it is the  most complete diet book I have come across.  I finally understand how many  types of diets work (not just low carb diets).<br />McDonald begins with a  history of ketogenic diets and then goes into a detailed explanation of how  various nutrients (both macro and micro) affect your body.  After this  explanation he presents three versions of the ketogenic diet, with two of  the diets aimed at athletic individuals who are looking to maintain their  exercise performance while on one of these programs.  Each diet is  accompanied by detail information about how to implement the diet.<br />As I  have said, the material in this book is incredibly detailed and completed,  but what really makes this book worth 5 stars is that the information is  presented in a non-biased way.  According to the introduction, McDonald  wrote this book to clear confusion about ketogenic diets, not to champion  them.  Much of the material is accompanied by research references and  McDonald clearly states where research is lacking or where he is offering  his own opinion.<br />Overall, &quot;The Ketogenic Diet&quot; will make an  excellent addition to any dieter's collection of reading.  Also, if you are  considering a ketogenic diet this will gives you an unbiased view of how  they really work.	2000-07-17

However, after reading it I felt it is one of the best Perl books I have come across.   Most Perl books deal with Perl as a scripting language.  Conway treats pull  like a real development language.  He gives the standard introduction to  object orientation and objects in Perl and then quickly moves past this to  look at some of the unique features of Perl's OO development in Perl.  For  example, he covers blessing every type of reference possible, why you would  want to bless a particular type of reference and what the pros and cons are  of each approach.  <br />Conway also gives a very thorough coverage of  implementating true data encapsulation in Perl and presents several methods  for doing so.<br />Another thing that struck me about this book is Conway's  attention to detail.  In his code samples, he carefully explains why each  line was written a certain way.  He even notes which version of Perl a  certain feature or module first appeared in.<br />All in all, a wonderful  book.  Even if you have been developing in Perl for a while this book has  something to offer.	2000-07-14

It is material that you will find in many books, but Kleiner presents it in an organized manner and covers implementing this diet from all angles.  She talks about all of the macronutrients -- how much you need of each and why, and some of the micronutrients.  After discussing what to eat she talks about how to use the information to achieve your specific goals (building muscle or burning fat) and provides detailed plans for these goals.<br />I don't think this is the ultimate in diet books, but it is a worthwhile read if you are looking for a pretty complete book on high carb diets.  However, if you own a similar book (such as Optimum Sports Nutrition) this isn't worth the money.	2000-07-14

It is similiar to many low-carb diets, but addresses some of the concerns associated with those diets.  The diet involves consuming a fair amount of  high quality protein.  Unlike other low-carb diets, animal fats are  restricted.  Colker seems to feel that saturated fats are a health risk and  concentrates on consuming healthy fats -- fish oils, etc.  The only  carbohydrates allowed on the diet are incidental carbs that occur in  vegetables.  Direct carbohydrate sources such as breads and pastas are off  limits.  Vegetable consumption is very high and is used as a source of  fiber and other nutrients.<br />On the downside, I was disappointed with the  lack of detail in the book.  Colker describes the processes that cause a  low carbohydrate diet to result in fat loss, but doesn't give the detail I  was hoping for.  After reading the book I found myself purchasing  additional books to help understand how these diets really work.<br />Since  Colker was a former bodybuilder and powerlifter I was hoping for more  information about how this diet relates to athletes.  Exercise is covered  in the book and he emphasizes how important exercise is to include with any  diet, but he doesn't discuss the issues of athletic performance and this  diet.  In particular I was looking for information about energy and muscle  growth in carbohydrate restricted environments.  For this information  you'll need to look elsewhere (&quot;The Ketogenic Diet&quot;).<br />Finally,  other reviews have complained about the many references to a particular  supplement company in this book.  On my initial read I didn't think too  much of these, especially after reading the note at the end of the book  which states that Colker receives no money for promoting these products.   However, on subsequent reads I think he could have de-emphasized this  company a bit and talked about the supplement industry as a whole.  The  repetitive plugs have made me a bit more skeptical.<br />One closing note -- I  tried emailing the address given at the end of the book with my questions  and was pleasantly surprised to receive a reply from the author within a  couple days.	2000-07-11

For the most part, the only thing that makes the hikes in this book &quot;winter hikes&quot; is their elevation.  In reality the hikes in this book are enjoyable all  year.<br />The summary information provided with each hike includes the  distances, estimates trip time, trail type and other useful information  such as the potential avalanche danger on the trail.  It also includes the  starting elevation and elevation gain of the trail so you can judge the  potential for encountering snow.<br />The rating system takes some getting  used to.  Since many of the trails are in the lower elevations, don't  expect jaw dropping views at every turn.  Even highly rated trails will  spend a lot of time in the woods.<br />Although I have said this guide is  useful year-round, I think it is best for 3 season hiking.  During the  summer you should use other guides that provide better coverage of the high  elevation trails.	2000-06-11

The general usage information is well structured and each topic is covered in detail.<br />For me the real value in this book  comes from the section on analyzing data.  The author discusses the  worksheet functions but then delves into common analysis situations. Their  coverage of financial analysis discusses all of the different financial  functions and how to use each of them.  The statistical analysis section  talks about each of the different distributions supported and when each  should be used.  Finally they present a what-if analysis section that shows  how to use Excel's solver and scenario manager.<br />The book even touches on  Visual Basic, but only enough to get your feet wet with Excel's macros.  <br />All in all a very good book.. much more than I was expecting from a  general &quot;how to use Excel&quot; book.	2000-06-07

Surprisingly there is useful material throughout this volume.  Walkenbach covers Excel programming from start to finish in a  way that programmers of all levels will understand.  He begins with a bit  of Excel history and moves into simple VBA development and eventually  covers various &quot;advanced&quot; topics such as pivot tables, charts and  user forms.  His writing is clear and there are plenty of examples  throughout the book.  He is even careful to point out version compatibility  issues.<br />Experienced programmers will find most of the book skimmable.  In  about an hour you can pick up most of the VBA syntax and be on your way to  developing simple applications.  Some space is devoted to software  development methodology, but not too much.

It covers how the glycemic index can be used in enhancing sports performance by discussing when to eat foods with different GI's.  The books  begins with an overview of the glycemic index (good enough that you may not  need to read the original book) and then moves into discussing it's impacts  on sports nutrition.  It closes by presenting several case studies that  give examples of how the GI can be intergrated with various sports  programs.<br />For general athletic events this is a good book.  It is well  written and is a quick and easy read -- you can get the main points out of  it in about 30 minutes.  The material in it can be useful to anyone that  engages in physical activity, not just athletes.<br />However, it doesn't  cover how the glycemic index and carbohydrate consumption can be used to  increase lean body mass and decrease body fat.  Weight control is dicussed,  but there isn't much emphasis on the difference between body fat and  muscle.  I was looking to understand how I could use the glycemic index to  help increase lean body muscle and decrease body fat.

This book will show you how to identify those potentially  very lucrative stocks that can't really be valued with current techniques  -- ones that require a more subjective determination.  It then shows how to  identify those companies that will continue to produce good returns and  offer a great long term investment opportunity.<br />The writing style (as  with all of their books) is extremely conversational.  In fact, in some  cases this book can probably be too conversational.  I enjoyed the style at  first, but just wanted to get right to the details by the end.<br />The  measurements they use to make judgements about a company are clearly  explained and then followed up with several case studies.  Throughout the  book they provide many examples of their techniques put into practice.<br />It  would have been nice summary sheets were provided for the major techniques  introduced.  I've found that after the first read I had to go back and  takes notes.<br />All in all a very worthwhile purchase.	2000-02-10

It is part of a two book series with this one focussing on the &quot;how&quot; and the next one on the &quot;why&quot;.  Sure, Nielsen  mentions the results of research and user tests throughout the book, but  doesn't dwell on it.  This information is just used as supporting evidence  for his design points.<br />It is fair to say that the material in this book  is common sense.  While you read it, everything Nielsen says makes perfect  sense, but look around the web a bit and you'll find many sites that  violate these basic principles.  Other books make the same points, but I  haven't come across any that do it as well as this one -- by backing the  points up with research and several examples.  If you are looking for one  web usability book to buy, this is it.<br />Some reviews clearly feel the  other way, but I think the book itself is a case study in usability.  The  layout of each page is create and the screenshots are very clear and well  captioned.	2000-02-10

The nutrition plan involves eating relatively small, balanced meals throughout the day, but  does not require calorie counting or other &quot;tracking&quot; techniques  that can become frustrating and feel controlling.  The exercise side of the  program involves regular weight training and cardio exercise.  Again,  nothing that requires a ridiculous time commitment and can be pretty easily  integrated into your daily routine.<br />I have been lifting for years and  found the planning recommendations (plan your meals and exercise ahead of  time) a great addition to my routine.  Writing everything down ahead of  time forces me to think about how to structure my day and still integrate  good nutrition and exercise.<br />As I said, this book also has a lot to  offer experienced trainiers.  In particular I was referring to the planning  mentioned above, but it also provides another training split that is worth  trying if you are looking for some variety in your program.  In just a few  weeks of doing this I have already seen my bodyfat drop -- mainly because  cardio is now planned into my routine.  However, I should also say that for  experienced trainers, much of the key information in this book can be  obtained from the Body for Life website and some of the articles that  appeared in Muscle Media.<br />Several other reviews have suggested this  book is nothing more than a supplement ad and is heavily dependent on  supplements.  This is just not true.  The book does suggest the use of  supplements on a couple pages, but does not say they are required for the  program and doesn't try to push them throughout the book.  This is  something you can complete eating standard foods -- no shakes, powders or  pills required.<br />If there is a downside it is that the book lacks  direction on where to go after the initial 12 weeks.  Sure, you can  continue on the program and perhaps modify it a little to keep things  interesting, but it doesn't address what do you if you are really  interested in building muscle (or whatever your goal is).  It is fair to  say this book isn't the proper place for such things, but it would be nice  if it provided some initial information and guidance in these areas.on the program and perhaps modify it a little to keep things  interesting, but it doesn't address what do you if you are really  interested in building muscle (or whatever your goal is).

While I was learning Perl syntax I found that it served very well when language guides such as &quot;Programming Perl&quot; fell short.  When I started  using the language I didn't have the syntax totally mastered and came  across various little questions and problems.  The &quot;Perl  Cookbook&quot; addressed both of these by providing succinct solutions to  my problems while helping me learn more about Perl syntax.<br />Furthermore,  this book exposes you to the various Perl modules available in a more  natural way than searching for them in a general language reference like  &quot;Perl in a Nutshell&quot;.  Most recipies in the book present a simple  code solution and then refer to a module that provides the same (and often  extended) functionality.	2000-01-19

It is by no means a repair manual (grab a Chiltons if you're interested in repair information), but will give you  very detailed information about each area of your vehicle and provides a  very detailed history along the way.  For example, the chapter on winches  and off-road accessories goes into great detail about the types of gears  found in winches and the pros and cons of each.<br />Each chapter is readable  on its own.  So, if you happen to be interested in suspension upgrades one  day and are tired of reading various Jeep catalogs, flip open to that  chapter and read on.<br />Other reviews have pointed out that the information  on the TJ is lacking.  I have to agree on this point.  When I originally  purchased the book I was expecting a full treatment of the TJ with some  additional information about previous Jeeps.  In fact, the opposite is  true.  Information about the TJ has been added throughout the book, but the  TJ isn't a main theme.	2000-01-12

However, I have some small gripes with the book.  In some cases the module reference doesn't talk about the  caveats for a particular module/method that you might want to know about  when you are quickly looking it up.  The book could be better designed to  answer what a user might be looking to know (and anticipate what would be  helpful to tell them).<br />While I do like having this book around, as I have  become more familiar with Perl I have found myself increasingly using the  Perl Cookbook as my reference.	2000-01-10

It is very well written and understandable.  Greene uses well constructed examples that are easy to  understand and keep the book moving.  I found that after reading this I  really didn't look at the world in the same way -- but I guess it is fair  to say that could be say after absorbing many other physics books.<br />On the  down side (other reviews have mentioned this), I found the book a bit  pedantic at times, but it is a great work regardless.	2000-01-05

The hikes I've done out of this book have been fantastic.  The authors basically let you know how much  &quot;bang for your buck&quot; you get on each hike, and they are right on.   During the top rated hikes you get to amazing and varied scenery very  quickly.  Color photos would be nice, but you can't have everthing.. :)	2000-01-04

I spent a lot of time looking for STL books, and after 3 tries ended up with this one.  It gives thorough coverage to the entire standard  library without being terribly dry.  The downside of the book is that it  doesn't explain the motivation or the detailed mechanics behind the  standard library.  If you really start to use the STL and are considering  extending it I would recommend also having a copy of Generic Programming  and the STL.	1999-11-22
