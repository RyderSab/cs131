The book is a rather simple and honest look at all  that goes on when we lose someone dear to us and gives us some ideas on how to handle that process. <br /> <br />\\"He Only Takes the Best\\" is not a deep and ponderous tome. What it does is go right to the point on how awful it is to lose a dear one and gives us things we can do to get past that process and move on. <br /> <br />Months ago I lost my mom and am always looking for ideas on how to put this devastating experience in some context. Stephanie's book did help in that process and gave me some thoughts to grasp onto and process for which I am grateful. <br /> <br />If you lost a loved one, then this book will be a help to you.	2005-06-03

Bush is shown by Bill Press to be the worst President this country has ever had and should be voted out of office this November with not a second thought.<br />Bill Press outlines all of his reasons in his book but certainly Bush/Cheney getting us into this fiasco in Iraq should be reason enough. How many lives were premenantly altered by this war that was fought for reasons that were proven false. There were no weapons of mass destruction. Iraq wasn't involved with Bin Laden. Yet, aside from Michael Moore and publications like Mother Jones, the sleepy press sits by and gives Bush/Cheney pass after pass after pass.<br />In the end, as Bill Press has so well articulated in his book this election is amounting to one of the most significant ones in the history of our country. As Bill has noted, we cannot afford more of Bush and he must be voted out of office for our country cannot endure anymore leadership of these right wing ideologues.	2004-07-12

Larry Flynt then goes on to clearly articulate the power of the average man when they vote and participate in the system to advance their own needs and not listen to the nonsense of elitist political people like Bush/Cheney.<br />Flynt also highlights his now famous \\"Flynt Report\\" that derailed the the Republicans when they were going after Clinton. This is worth reading as the hypocracy of Bob Barr, Bob Livingstone and other politicians are amazing.<br />I'd say this book is good for those who want a meat and potatoes approach to the current arguments against Bush/Cheney. The Flynt book is good to have in your home to remind yourself about how hypocritical the Republicans can be toward sexual matters and, more importantly, what specific reasons there are to defeat Bush/Cheney.<br />I'd recommend buying the book.	2004-07-08

It is a fair lambasting of how pathetic the progressive/liberals have been to communicate through  the media and how successful the right wingers have been in not only getting their word out but in taking over the Republican Party pushing out the gentlemen of the stripes of Bob Michel, Hugh Scott and so on who worked with Democrats and replaced these fine men with uncompromising ideologues like the  Senate Majority Leader, Bill Frist. <br />What is scary about Mr. Brock's book is that he is right. What is worse is that the entire mess in Iraq is in part what is the fruit of one voice-the conservatives-dominating the airwaves and dialogue. This horrible fiasco can find it's root in a society where one voice acts unstopped and where a media has not done their job by questioning the party in power.<br />In fact, Sean Hannity often uses \\"the war\\" to call into question anyone who challanges the Bush Administration saying they are unpatriotic. This is called having your cake and eating it too for if the conservative voice is in power and makes mistakes they can silence their critics by invoking patriotism and continue to make mistakes unchecked.<br />Mr. Brock concludes his book by saying their is room for hope as the internet is a freeing voice in the total domination by the conservatives of the media. I hope he's right. This crazy war has taken so many lives and permanently damaged others that their must be a role for all political voices or else this democracy we all love is doomed. Really doomed.	2004-06-03

However, I was compelled to pay attention to the points being made because they were good ones. Through humor Ric gets you to think about things which is always good.<br />This is a good book with a soundtrack too.

Specifically, he strays from really getting into a honest analysis of his own deficiencies as a reporter.<br />For example, he clearly had little to do with providing insight into the ongoing problems of Iraq. In fact, in weeks before the prison scandal Russert was grilling Kerry on why he threw his ribbons away while at the same time the huge scandal was about to go public.<br />The book fails on several levels and comes across as empty in depth. To me, if you want to really understand the media read Bob Woodward or Sy Hersh but avoid the Russert drivel.<br />Tim Russert is a millionaire Washington insider who has little connection to the real world despite his thin efforts to say otherwise. His reporting is out of sinc with other better journalists and, as a result, his book is not worth reading.<br />There are far better journalists to read about. Pursue their life stories.	2004-05-21

From the start Joseph Wilson takes the reader into another world where diplomacy and politics have the highest of stakes. He writes with such a candor that it is impressive to the most experienced of readers.<br />Let me say this in a nutshell--this is a memoir of substance and so thought provoking in it's look at the Bush Administration that I can understand the Republican attack dogs getting upset.

Bush	Books	4	264	304	N	N	Detailed and compelling	I've read many reviewers who insist on revisiting Watergate and damning John Dean as a way to dismiss his arguments. To that I say that \\"judge not lest ye shall be judged.\\" Dean has a right to articulate his thoughts and those who wish have a right to listen. Nuff said!!<br />As for this book, it presents a detailed review of the secret lives of our current leaders--Bush and Cheney. They are highlighted as crafty media manipulators who appear to be one thing but are really something else. <br />For example, Bush and Cheney speak of platitudes toward the enviroment but are really wanting to drill in the artic wilderness for oil.<br />John Dean is alarmed at what is going on and, after reading the book, I am too. His discussion on the leaking of the identity of the wife of Ambassador Wilson (she was a CIA operative) was riveting. John Dean predicted that there will be a HUGE scandal in the Bush Administration over this leak and from what the media is starting to report this may be the case.<br />Overall, this is a good look at the Bush/Cheney secrecy. My only complaint is that the writing is somewhat dry at times but the book is still worth reading.	2004-04-13

Bush that we are getting to a dangerous point in our country's history. She offers the thought that asks how long can the downtrodden be tossed aside before the entire social fabric that hold our society collapses? <br />Ms. Huffington adds that the amount of people looking for emergency rooms as  their health care is increasing at alarming rates. She cites headlines from around the country that note the plight of the working poor and wonders why they are being ignored by our political system.<br />More importantly, Ms. Huffington calls into question that lack of leadership by the media who've abandoned the task of reporting on how Bush has broken promises to help the poor and children but had rewarded the rich time and again with excessive tax cuts. <br />Ms. Huffington then calls into question the political rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger and sadly notes that he is nothing but a warmed over George W. Bush who upon taking office made his first action to strip away a cost of living increase for California's poor. She then says that the media has fallen in love with Arnold and is giving him a pass time and again all to the determent of the poor of California as he cuts their social net.<br />This is a well written book on so many levels that is better than the Franken book as it is less angry and more intellectual. Her book is more of a strategic argument for a new course of action for the Democratic Presidential Candidate of 2004 and the party itself. <br />In short, this is an excellent political treatise that should be read by all who are looking for a new course for our country.	2004-04-11

This is an important book for the rock music scene as it highlights the life of Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. Not only does the book do a stunning job laying out the life and times of Dennis Wilson but it dives head first into the world of 60's and 70's rock and determines his role in these crazy years for the music scene.<br />This book does what many rock books fail to do which is to tell an honest to God story saying both the good and the bad but putting it all out on the table so that the tale is properly told.<br />For example, this book examines Dennis Wilson's role within the Beach Boy hierarchy and finds that he was treated poorly by people like Mike Love who didn't have half his talent. The author mourns the loss to the world of music that Love and others in the Beach Boys caused by constantly thwarting Dennis as he tried to get his music out in the public.<br />The book also honestly finds that Dennis was his own worst enemy by using drugs and booze which effectively short circuited his talent causing yet another loss for music lovers as we never got to hear the complete catalogue of his real creativity.<br />Finally, the book looks at what Dennis Wilson did do musicially and finds it amazing. His epic 70's solo LP &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot; will rank as one of the real rock gems as time goes on. The author reviews this LP and tells how incredible it was and how it continues to grow in popularity with rock fans as the years move on.<br />This book is out of print which is sad as there are precious few publications like it. Buy it used and read one of the best rock tales ever but more importantly read it to learn just how profound Dennis Wilson was in his talent and his times.<br />Get this book back in print!	2004-04-08

In recent years that has declined somewhat. However, he continues to write and his body of work expands yearly.<br />This book shows the ongoing adventures of &quot;Blackie&quot; Ryan, a Priest/Detective who is the star of the mystery novels written by Father Andrew Greeley. &quot;Blackie&quot; actually sprang from Father Greeley's earlier books when he appeared as a beloved sleuth/cleric who helped settle mysteries that baffled others. Eventually, &quot;Blackie&quot; gained his own series of books which brings us to the current one.<br />This is a fun look at the world of Priest/Sleuth &quot;Blackie&quot; Ryan as he solves the murder of a monk on the University of Chicago campus. All the usual Greeley touches are here--descriptions of the life of a priest and how he relates to the congregation, the world of the rectory, the interrelation of the Catholic hierarchy with each other, the locked room murder and all the typical aspects of a &quot;Blackie&quot; Ryan mystery are here.<br />Yet, I can't help think that Father Greeley needs to energize the &quot;Blackie&quot; Ryan series. This is a great series that appears to be going through the motions. Yes, this is a good book but one suspects that it can be much better. Father Greeley is coasting a bit and it shows. The kicker is that he still has the ability to write a great mystery and the charactars to do so. He needs to refocus and do just that.<br />I'd suggest he get a very strong charactar, Cardinal Sean Cronin, to become more involved in the stories. This charactar has been reduced to a minor role in his books and the series has suffered. I'd also suggest the charactar Mike Casey be involved more as he too is interesting. Father &quot;Blackie&quot; needs to get more involved in solving a crime related to the Catholic church which Father Greeley knows well and can weave many fascinating aspects to in his stories that actually getyou thinking about this faith. <br />To some extent, Father Greeley has strayed from writing about the Catholic Church to focusing on academia and it makes for a less interesting novel.<br />In short, this is a good book by a good author who has gotten into a rut so to speak. One hopes Father Greeley can rediscover the magic he once had and get &quot;Blackie&quot; Ryan back into some more interesting and rich adventures.	2004-03-29

His words are strung together arguments that attempt to form a text for his liberal beliefs. To put his book in context it's without substance much like a boy band is to the rock music scene.<br />Alan seems like a nice guy. I believe he feels the way he does about being a liberal but beyond that this book is totally souless. It appears to be the work of a very good editor who organized Alan's points into chapters which became a book. If anyone is to be credited, it's Alan's editor who, to me, appeared to be a driving force in making this a presentable work. Which goes back to my point about this being similar to a boy band. It's not heartfelt. It's passionless. It mimics other books much like a boy band mimics other acts but it's all contrived. There isn't any deep rooted emotions here.<br />Alan spends time saying this conservative is my friend and that conservative is my friend to the point that he is so busy appeasing everyone that he comes across lacking depth. He fence straddles on several points to the extent that you think he was running for office or something.<br />In short, while the points raised in the book appeared to be Alan's beliefs the book is empty of an emotional core that brings the writer into what is being said. Read Sidney Blumenthal's &quot;Clinton Wars&quot; to see what a real writer with heart and deep rooted convictions writes like. Those who like an &quot;intro to liberalism&quot; may find this book acceptable but everyone else can take a pass.	2004-03-17

Knowledgeable fans should avoid it. The flow of the book doesn't work for me as the comments by band members and others in the book gives it a confusing touch. Other reviewers have well detailed the flaws of this book but let me say it is average and adds little to understanding the Kiss legacy.<br />By far the best book on Kiss is &quot;Kiss and Sell&quot; by C.K. Lendt who was a former Kiss employee during their 70's heyday. This is the ultimate Kiss book and a fantastic rock book in and of itself.

I had to give this book five stars since it's unlikely readers will ever get a more candid look at Hollywood's film industry than this tome. And it is a literary epic to say the least with 752 pages to testify to that. <br />The style of the writing is a little off the beaten path. The reader is treated to all types of asides in the book including samples of Joe's wife's diary.<br />The book also features a gut wrenching look at the relationship between Joe and his Dad. This is a sad one though and, to Joe's credit, he makes himself look bad in how he handled his Dad's involvment with Facisism. I think this particular aspect of Joe's life is something that Joe still needs to resolve. Joe's Dad needed to be forgiven by a son who couldn't do so. This is indeed very sad.<br />The book also details the empty lives of people like Sharon Stone who look very souless and shallow. It makes you glad you never met them. <br />We also read about the shallow aspects of Joe's life--smoking weed, drinking, womanizing and self absorbtion--all took a lot of his time. Joe appears to have gone through a lot of money including that from his divorce in some type of search for his soul. <br />In the end, the reader is given the impression that Joe has found joy and peace with his wife, Naomi and 4 children. He also seems to have bonded well with his two older children from his first marriage.<br />This book should be read for a brutally honest look at the film industry of Hollywood and one screenwriter's experiences.<br />I wish Joe well. He should write more books about this interesting topic.	2004-02-25

He took on the major corporations and powers that be and won. He is a great man. This book helps to define him and his beliefs which is why it should be read.<br />However, in 2004 we see slowly emerging a not so brilliant man. But one who knows at some level that he is being maginalized by trends and times that are passing him by. Slowly but surely he is fading away.<br />Simply put, in an era of instant communication and endless news broadcasts, Ralph Nader is being eclipsed by other forms of investigation and muckraking. Some of it is for the worse like Matt Drudge but others are more substantive like some of the good work done by &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine and numerous progressive publications.<br />As a result of times passing Ralph by and his obvious need to be in the public eye, he has taken to involve and embarrass himself in a presidential run that is very sad. The 2004 campaign is such a sorrowful effort that it does not reflect on his work well. Rather it is a vanity stunt aimed at basking in the attention of his admirers at the expense of the values he onced shared. <br />Instead of working to defeat George Bush, Ralph is on an ego trip as he runs for President in 2004.<br />So, read this book to understand the principles of Ralph Nader but try to forget his very pathetic presidential effort of his in 2004.	2004-02-23

This book unmasks the reign of havoc that the Bush/Cheney team has undertaken upon our country. This is a wildly zealous conservative administration totally intolerant to open mindedness or anything that differs from it's own approach. Simply put, this book argues convincingly that Bush must be defeated in 2004.<br />The book makes a clear point that Bush is all about facades.

Face facts.<br />I am an Edwards supporter but I can't deny that John Kerry is a good man with an honorable record of public service. He should be proud.<br />This book is an honest assessment of his Vietnam experienes which are told warts and all. What comes through is a brutal honesty that is rare in politics these days. And a good overview of a dark period in our U.S. history. However, this book should be read to understand Kerry's greatness and to learn lessons from this ugly war.<br />The Bush/Cheney war record is nonexistent. So far, the sketchy evidence of the Bush war record is that he was proven to have shopped at the base company store a few times and that he had his hair cut on the base on occasion (kidding). Truthfully, Bush's guard experience is difficult to assess and shaky to measure. This is not the case with Kerry. He actually fought in a war and was wounded.<br />Read the book and learn what a great man John Kerry is.	2004-02-21

They could care less about the middle class or the average guy as O'Neill illustrates. All they care about is making sure wierdos like Grover Norquist, a fanatical right winger who has the ear of all the Republicans in Washington, has his agenda to strip the federal government away from helping the average guy taken care of.<br />Please people realize that Dick Chaney and the current Bush Administration could care less about you. If you need evidence, just read this book by Paul O'Neill. And then go out and vote for anyone other than George Bush.<br />By the way, where was this so called \\"compassionate President\\" when O'Neill brought back all the evidence of suffering in Africa?

It unveils the truth behind Kiss and the tremendous amounts of money blown by the members and manager, Bill Aucoin. Gene Simmons tends to gloss over the reality that he too participated in the financial fiasco that was their 79 tour. However, in a fair and even handed way, CK Lendt tells how the Kiss members and manager foolishly spent money that could have been better invested.<br />In fact, the reunion tours of 96 and thereafter really gave the members the financial stability that they'd lost in the late 70's.<br />The irony of Kiss is that without Ace and Peter they were nothing but a sinking nostalagia act. With the reunion tour and make-up back on and Ace and Peter in the band the group suddenly became interesting.<br />In the end, the great success of Kiss is not the bluster of Gene Simmons or posturings of Paul Stanley but the dynamic of all four members--Ace, Peter, Gene and Paul.<br />This book is honest and brilliant in it's review of the story of Kiss and of the music business.

I love commerce as much as the next guy but when you are not getting your bang for your dollar then the system breaks down.<br />The \\"curse\\" the Kennedy family is under is a public relations ploy promoted to sell books. Their is no \\"curse\\".<br />The only \\"cursing\\" going on here was the sound of the readers as they made their way through this book and realized the publisher and author had taken what is in essence a magazine article and stuffed it with filler to make it into a book. <br />Basically, the only thing redeeming about this book is the new devlopments on the JFK, Jr. and Carolyn Kennedy marriage. Everything else is rehased and warmed over Kennedy family stories that one has read or heard of before. <br />While most of us were very fond of JFK, Jr. it is of historical value to fully explore his life and marriage and the author did so in a professional way. JFK, JR and Carolyn were good people but, after reading this book, an argument can be made that they may have been better off not married to one and other. RIP to them both.<br />Once the story of JFK, Jr and Carolyn concludes in this book, the book itself for the most part is over too. The rest is leftover Kennedy family stories...	2003-08-26

It seems to me that several reviewers miss the point of this book which is to make clear a life philosophy that gained Gene Simmons millions of dollars and brought him literally from rags to riches. End of story.<br />One of the points of the book was to really call into question the whole idea of marriage. Gene doesn't like it. He makes salient points that back up his view. Clearly, getting married according to Gene, is a costly move for guys. With over 50% of couples divorcing and with estates being split in half--Gene makes a point. One reviewer actually said that marriage is profitable because of two incomes. Amazing! Gene would say that upon either having children or getting divorced that situation may change and with a very high divorce rate in our country that will situation will change. I wish this reviewer well but feel that this person is living in a fools paradise.<br />This is a good book or audio book. I'd recommend audio because the author's voice evokes emotion that makes his point clear which is that there is no substitute for hard work or taking advantage of opportunities which are the keys to success. For this advice alone the book deserves attention as you can't get this advice enough.<br />I conclude by saying that Gene only asks that men fully think about marriage instead of leaping into the dark. What one person does is up to them but he urges people to really understand the financial ramifications of what they are getting into. This is good advice from a good book.<br />I didn't care for the packaging of the book. I thought the CD audio version seemed to have flimsy packaging but the book is so good I can overlook this matter.	2003-08-07

It gives a terrific account of the sad marriage of Johnny and Vickie Bench and puts their short and crumbling union in the context of the 1975 season. In fact, their marriage was such a fiasco that it merits it's own book.

Only a school boy couldn't see through this childish ploy which is to justify the ill founded opinions of those writing the review.<br />Take it from a life long Republican who was forced to leave his party due to the low lifes that now occupy it. This is a great book and the beginning of the more accurate look at just what the Clinton years were all about.	2003-06-04

He draws you in with a fascinating look at a down and out lawyer who finds a better part of himself through the things that happen in this book. Ultimately, this is a novel about redemption and written in a way that makes it's points without appearing to lecture or moralize. It's just a good novel. Period.<br />I had the pleasure of attending a seminar where Stephen appeared and was highly impressed by his wisdom, communication skills and his interesting ideas about writing and legal thrillers.	2002-10-23

This is an entertaining novel full of suspense, humor and good old fashion fun. What emerges from the experience of reading this novel is that Lisa Scottoline is someone who clearly understands charactar development and pacing of the storyline. This, in turn, makes for a terrific book and one that leaves you caring about the story, the points being made and the people in this tale. Simply put, this is a fine book by a talented writer. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.<br />I had the pleasure of being in the audience at a seminar where Lisa spoke. She was a wonderful and warm speaker who connected with her audience and conveyed the essence of her work to those attending. This book is truly representative of that great work.	2002-10-16

Insecure thoughts. Angry thoughts. Proud thoughts. Thoughts of love and desire. He takes all of these sentiments and ties them together into Ash Wednesday which is a ode to human growth and the joys and pains of it. This book is about a man and a woman growing together yet wondering if they should be elsewhere but in the end they feel their time together is worthwhile and stick it out. <br />This is not a great book but it is a good book and one written by a man of depth and substance brave enough to speak his mind about the wackiness of the human condition.	2002-09-21

Robert Reich writes in a clear prose that is easily understood and allows the reader to be fully informed without being lectured or preached at.<br />His points about the evolution of our work force are food for thought and one hopes that the current leadership in Washington is listening to Reich but I doubt it. Mr. Reich is actually a thinker and not a rabid partisan politician which makes him a refreshing breath of fresh air at a time when tv is full of bombast with everyone talking and no one listening. Chris Matthews did you hear me?<br />Read any book by Robert Reich and you'll learn something. It's like visiting with a favorite teacher or professor that you admire and respect. The hours fly by and you're just in awe of the person and what they have to say. Robert Reich is a true gentleman and a wise man as well.	2002-07-09

This is not an uplifting book and the lead charactar in this true story is not some slap happy soul. It's a painful examination of what life is truly like for those who tread this difficult existence of working the service industry jobs--working in restaurants, markets, etc--which keeps them at survival level but not much more. If for no other reason, it should be read to raise our societal awareness and concern for those living on the brink of poverty.	2002-05-11

A nanny works for a wealthy NYC couple with one child who, at first, seems boorish but soon is a wonderful being trapped in a lousy family that defines disfunctional. The nanny learns her lessons on life that wealth itself doesn't attribute stellar qualities to people but just means they have a lot of cash. <br />The book is a jem and a highly suggest it be read. The star of the book, the Nanny, is a good charactar as well as the child, Grayer--who is shown to be a loving soul tossed into a wealthy version of emotional hell.<br />In the end, we feel and pray for the lives of those who have to serve the banal rich that are featured in this book but, more importantly, we pray for the children who find themselves the hands of emotionally vacant people as are written about in the Nanny Diaries.<br />Great book. Read it.	2002-05-03

The facts are the facts and David Brock has told the truth about the Republican Party and it's conservative members in such a way that I must leave it. This is a powerful book that must be read by anyone interested in politics. I never thought I'd become a Democrat but there is no choice after reading this great book.	2002-03-31

Seth Morgan used his sense of language and clever vocabulary to create a stunning look at the underbelly of life. Seth doesn't gloss over the street scene but rather he makes it human with his own humor and observations.<br />This is a terrific book. Get it.<br />The sad passing of Seth Morgan so early in his career as an author has caused Homeboy to be forgotten for the being such a literary gem. <br />It's a loss for us all that we'll never know just what Seth could have done in future works had he lived on but we do have Homeboy. Read it, you'll love it.	2001-03-30

Karen Duffy takes on a very serious illness and emerges the winner! She realizes that the illness is not who she is but that it is something that must be contended with and face. In a sense, Karen found the secret of life in that she came to understand the big picture--events are not the person--you are what you eminate from your heart. <br />The only mild criticism I had is that Karen soft peddled the nontraditional medical treatments. It would have been best for her to have left that chapter out--it added nothing to the book.<br />I loved the part about Whit Crane of the band &quot;Ugly Kid Joe&quot; who Karen dated. I think Whit was the most lively soul in the book and had more substance than Karen suspected when they dated. His role in the book made it all the more fun.	2001-03-27
