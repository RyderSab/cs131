In the meantime, I have acquired many other versions, but one is still one of my favorites.  I used to refer to it as \\"my second brain\\" because it has been a tremendous help for me for accessing higher wisdom and getting practical solutions to some challenges that bordered on impossible - finding a way when there seemed to be no way out.  The wisdom and guidance from this book has enabled me to accomplish some things that were very important for me, but which I didn't have a clue where even to begin to turn into reality.  It has helped me to turn some seemingly impossible dreams into reality.  For this I am profoundly grateful to the author of this book.<br /><br />I have started using this book when I was a teenager and when some other translations and interpretations of I Ching left me more confused, whereas this one provided easy to understand and straightforward counsel.<br /><br />As you keep on working with I Ching, you begin to develop a \\"feel\\" for different hexagrams that goes beyond words and comes about through actual experience.  In time, you don't have to read the interpretations any more because you have the knowingness of the meaning of each hexagram.  In time, you may develop a greater and deeper relationship with your higher wisdom, and what you need to know will emerge into your conscious awareness through direct guidance, without the necessity of using outer oracles.  But, until you learn to clearly discern the voice of your higher wisdom, I Ching can be tremendously helpful.<br /><br />Other than the simple and easy to understand language of this book, I particularly appreciated that the interpretations of each hexagram are divided in three sections - related to your material life, to your love life and to your spiritual life.  This makes the book even more \\"user friendly\\".  I think that the book is particularly suitable and the best choice for someone who is new to working with the profound wisdom of I Ching.ound wisdom of I Ching.	2005-08-19

People will anyway accept or reject these stories based upon the worldview they have vested interest in upholding - those without any personal reference points and understanding of the principles behind these extraordinary abilities will reject them and those who have invested time in spiritual practices and have experienced the emergence of different powers in themselves do not need any apologies.  They will find these stories entertaining and valuable.<br /><br />Some stories are about experiences with people who have become wellknown in spiritual circles in the west, some stories are about people who are not well-known and prefer to remain anonymous.  A lot of stories involved different ways of being \\"zapped\\" with energy through an assortment of initiation ceremonies in which some form of transmission of energy is involved, and if you've ever participated at such event, you may already have an idea of what such experiences may entail.<br /><br />You will also find some interesting stories with experiences you might have never heard of before.	2005-07-18

The author says that he wrote the book to \\"put money into the hands of spiritual people\\".  Those who are truly spiritual cannot possibly be experiencing financial lack or any other kind of lack, simply because when one genuinely surrenders to the Infinite Loving Power and Wisdom within, and allows himself to be guided from within, all that is needed for his wellbeing will flow into his life.  If you hold in your consciousness that there is One Infinite Source of Abundance - and you love and honor this One Source (God) and keep on expressing gratitude for all the blessings you have already received and for those you desire to receive as if they are already yours (for in spirit they are), all money that you need will surely come into your life.  Truly spiritual people are, on the other hand, not greedy.  Greed comes out of fear that tomorrow you may not have enough, so you should better start accumulating as much as you can today.  Spiritual person KNOWS that the same Source which has provided for their needs today, will provide for their needs tomorrow and any other day - so they have all that they need.  Spiritual person trust, loves and follows the guidance of the Infinite Loving Power and Wisdom within.<br /><br />There is a place where the author of this book says that material wealth will bring you a sense of safety and security (so that you can meditate better).  There is nothing outside of you that will give you a genuine sense of safety and security.  Things in the outside world come and go.  The only things that can ever give you a genuine sense of safety and security is your awareness of the Infinite Loving Power and Wisdom within you - and it is the knowingness that through this Loving Power and Wisdom within you, you can create anything you may ever need, or rather that this Infinite Loving Power and Wisdom can create whatever is needed through you, is what will bring you a sense of security and peace.<br /><br />The author of this books also mentiones somewhere that you should be praying to him - no genuine spiritual teacher would ever tell you that.  Any genuine spiritual teacher would point you within and if there is anything that you should worship and pray to - it is this one Infinite Loving Power and Wisdom of God within you.<br /><br />The author offers two mantras in this book - Om Namah Shivaya and Thiru Neela Kantam (for karma busting).  I have been using mantras over the years and there were times when I have been changing Om Namah Shivaya basically the entire day for months - so I can say - yes, you can experience miracles by chanting mantras.  I have had many interesting experiences chanting that particular mantra. But, I'd add that I didn't just chant mantras mechanically - I would pour all the love I could find in me toward God when I was chanting them and if you pour all the love that you can find in you toward the Infinite, you will experience miracles in your life one way or another.  As for Karma busting - even repeat good old \\"Beloved God, only Thy Will Be done\\" and meaning it will be busting your karma.  Surrendering your \\"lower\\" self to your \\"Greater Self\\" will bust your karma, because in the process it will be Your Infinite Self, the God within you which will be expressing through you and God has no karma.  God also knows of no obstacles, so the path that you walk will be Light.<br /><br />I have never used mantras for the purpose of manifesting something.  I have chanted them because I found them uplifting, because they opened my heart and for me they were a way of singing praises and expressing love to God.  It is this desire to let God express through me to the best of my ability that has in turn produced miracles or whatever material things were needed for my wellbeing.  There was a time when I used to tell God what I wanted and then I got those things plus many others I would've rather done without, so I decided to change my way and let God decide for me.  That has worked beautifully for me.<br /><br />There are way too many people who would like to be able to use the power of God and miraculous abilities (siddhis), but on their own terms, without giving ear to the wisdom of God, without listening to their Inner Guidance (Higher Wisdom).  This ultimately leads one into misuse of power and the consequences (karma) may not be pleasant.  But then again, each one gets to learn this sooner or later from his own experience.<br /><br />Working with mantras gets to be pretty much like working with affirmations.  Yes, different sounds do have different vibrations and they will create resonance with certain energies within your own being, but pure mechanical repetition may bring you limited results.  You may read about or hear of different people using the same mantra and getting very different results - some experience practically nothing, others experience miraculous results - based on their intentions and expectations.<br /><br />The author mentions chanting the syllable \\"Ah\\" as a sound for manifesting.  If you do use it, it should help to open your heart, helping you in turn to express more Love and this part is true - everything is created out of LOVE, so as you keep on expressing more and more love, you will experience greater prosperity because you will be walking with Love (God).<br /><br />The rest of this book deals with meditations on spiritual symbols and outlines how to perform a simple ritual - if you're up to it.  Some people do find it helpful to engage in rituals, because it helps them to maintain focus on their goal.  This is particularly true for untrained minds.  And even using mala beads (well, it is pretty much like \\"rosary\\" which Christians use) helps both to focus one's mind and the beads, becoming charged with a particular vibration, are supposed to add more energy to your future prayers / manifestations.  There are different kinds of mala beads around, made out of different materials and if you'd like to experiment with them, you can check out different ones.  Yes, the author sells many items \\"meditation tools\\", but no one says that you have to buy them or that you have to buy them from him.<br /><br />The book ends with a part on astrology.  Astrology may be empowering for the insights you gain from it and it may also be disempowering as ultimately whenever you give power to anything that is outside of you - when you give power, and put your trust into anything other than the Infinite Loving Power and Wisdom within you, you are shortchanging yourself.so I decided to change my way and let God decide for me.

Spalding.  This book, though, brings people who have developed some extraordinary abilities into the present tense.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, the author does repeat quite often \\"China is so great\\" tune, but it is also true that a lot of countries in the East have greater awareness and appreciation for working with energy, and have been cultivating it to a greater extent than people in the West.  In the West, these awareness begin to spread more in the recent years.  It was often put down by those who are immersed in studying the world as if nothing other than material world existed.  From this book, though, it is obvious that even in China, there are many people who, due to lack of understanding that mind influences the energy which then expresses in physical dimension, they also had conflicts with accepting the reality of what they witnessed.<br /><br />The author has correctly pointed out that when you use whatever mind-power you are able to express and when you take care to develop it - it grows - when you don't use it - it diminishes.  This is true regardless of what skills any person may be using.  It is also a way of economy in nature.<br /><br />While there are few quotations in this book from the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine - as in \\"Be imperturbable and the true chi will come to you\\", this idea is not unique either to China or to Buddhism, it is a spiritual truth presented throughout all spiritual traditions. India's \\"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\\" is yet another book that deals with development of different abilities, yet the idea is that one should not focus on development of special abilities (siddhis), but rather just focus on realizing Oneness (Self-Realization).  This state of Oneness is in Christian Bible called entering the \\"Kingdom of God\\" - the method described as loving this Infinite Loving Power and Intelligence with all one's mind, heart, soul and strength.  The goal of alchemy - either Eastern (Taoist) or Western is again realizing this state of Oneness and from this state, the powers begin to emerge spontaneously when needed.  These powers are also intended to be used in service, out of love, not for selfish goals.<br /><br />The highest visible vibration of this One Power - the Source of All Energy - is Light - so appropriately the method used to unleash these powers to which every human being does have access are meditations on the Light.  With a quite a bit of children, mentioned in this book, who were helped in this process of unfolding inner power - it took only one such session to produce remarkable results.<br /><br />The book mentions how there are many more women (girls) who have these \\"special powers\\" than men (boys). This is not all that surprising because it is generally considered that women's \\"heart centers\\" are more open than men's and Love is the highest feeling vibration, Love is the essential quality of this Infinite Energy.<br /><br />The author then mentions how they have noticed that with most children these \\"special\\" powers begin to diminish after puberty.  This may also not be surprising because a certain leakage of energy occurs due to loss of blood (menstruation) in women and loss of semen (in men) and I might add that for this reason, there are special practices in Taoist Alchemy to prevent these leakage and to preserve the energy.  After all - all of these special abilities are based on \\"playing with energy\\" - opening the channels within to let it flow, generating it and directing it.  Focusing upon - meditating upon the Source of All of this Energy is one way to connect with it and let it express - different forms of qigong energy cultivation and manipulation exercises are another.Infinite Loving Power and Intelligence with all one's mind, heart, soul and strength.

US	44020425	R2QT0AK7VNVJV2	0876044658	262926550	Soul Development: Edgar Cayce's Approach for a New World	Books	5	23	24	N	N	Walk with God	This book is rich in so many wonderful insights both by Edgar Cayce and Kevin Todeschi.  The book contains many stories from Edgar Cayce's readings as well as follow-ups with individuals who received readings.  While the stories are entertaining to read, the main purpose of these stories is to illustrate how people's lives turn out when they choose to follow the voice of Spirit within them, and how it turns out when the choose to ignore it.  The emphasis is always on individual's choice.<br /><br />I was happy that at the beginning of the book, Kevin has pointed out that many people - whether spiritually inclined or those who have no interest in spirituality look for ways to be done and over with this life - to check out so to speak.  Yet, the idea is not to run away, but rather to bring Spirit into one's daily life, to bring Spirit to earth.  The one who \\"walks with God\\" in his daily life, does not have desire to run away, but rather to be of service, to be helpful, to express love and light of God.<br /><br />In many of the \\"readings\\" which were done for people who were looking for the cause of the problems they were facing in their current life - the \\"cause\\" was traced usually to something they did or lessons they haven't learned in past lives - yet, it doesn't matter whether you remember your past lives or not, the only true \\"cause\\" of any problems in the present is living one's life from the state of mind of separation of God.  The main \\"lesson\\" to be learned is to let Love, Power and Wisdom of God flow through in one's daily life.  When the individual chooses - decides - to put God first, and to walk with God every moment of his life, when the person chooses to let God express through all that he thinks and says and does - the problems fall away - because the lesson has been learned.  This doesn't take years of suffering - it can happen as instantly as the individual is willing to open himself completely to God.	2005-02-22

It is also true that Love is the Source of All Power and correctly so, in this book, the more love each individual develops, the more power he is able to express.  The characters in this book also correctly point out that all of these great abilties that emerge in the process are not what's important, nor are they ever meant to be used to show off or for self-importance - they are all a \\"gift\\" from Love (One Love permeating everything) and they are intended to be used out of love, in the service of love.<br /><br />Many wonderful truths are presented in this book, and yes it is a heart-warming book.  The book is written very much in the style of \\"Celestine Prophecy\\" and while it makes it for maybe more interesting reading (I suppose that wild chase helps to keep people's attention longer), it also gives you a filling that there is so much fluff in the book and that the whole point of the book could've been written on a few pages.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer noted, the stories in this book do have uncanny resemblances to the stories mentioned in \\"China's Super Psychics\\".  The book \\"China's Super Psychics\\", on the other hand, has some depth and unlike this book doesn't come across as fluffy.  It also contains stories that are way more amazing than the stories mentioned in this book.	2005-02-18
US	44020425	R36CO25BKHJM8	0062503073	188700327	The Ten Commandments	Books	5	39	41	N	Y	Brilliant Insights	Emmet Fox has done an amazing job of going beyond the obvious meaning of the ten commandments and bringing insight into different levels of meaning from physical to spiritual, emphasizing that the commandments were intended to bring to light metaphysical truths.  From this higher level of understanding, \\"thou shalt not's\\" are in effect impossibilities.<br /><br />Because ultimately \\"there is only One\\", from spiritual perspective whatever we do unto others, we do unto ourselves.  The commandments are in this way not intended to limit one's freedom and enjoyment of life, but to increase it through one's awareness of the universal principles, so that we don't hurt ourselves out of ignorance.<br /><br />All the commandments arise out of one, basic, essential truth - that there is only One Power, Love and Intelligence, that this One (God) is the Source of all our blessings and that by maintaining this awareness of oneness we can have everything we desire directly from the Source, without looking elsewhere.  All the pain and suffering (sin or error, if you like) arise from ignoring this one spiritual fact.<br /><br />Emmet Fox has beautifully explained why we can't use God's name in vain. \\"God\\" is for each individual that to which each individual attributes power, that which each individual attributes as a source of his blessings.  And since our thoughts, emotions, beliefs manifest in our daily experience, each one will experience in his life whatever the idea of God represents to him.  Thus an individual who wholeheartedly believes God to be loving and good, will program positive expectations in his subconscious and will manifest such experiences in his life, and the individual who believes God to be vengeful and just waiting to dish out punishments, will experience hardship.  For an individual who says he doesn't believe in God, he is still \\"worshipping\\" that to which he attributes power and if \\"that\\" is limited, so will he limit his own life because he will program limitations into his subconscious mind and will have to experience them in his life.  After all, one's outer experience of life is merely a reflection of one's own thoughts, emotions and beliefs.<br /><br />Emmet Fox also explains the symbolism used in the Bible - and Egypt and Exodus (where this commandments are placed in the Bible) are very rich in symbolism.  In essence \\"getting out of Egypt\\" stands for getting out of trouble and limitation, shifting one's awareness from physical to spiritual, going from effect back to cause, learning to contact the Infinite Love, Power and Wisdom within and learning to express them in one's daily life.<br /><br />I was delighted that Emmet has pointed out the meaning of \\"sexual polarity\\" and merging or feminine and masculine principle from the perspective of prayer (while I believe that every metaphysician is fully aware of this, most people are not): masculine principle stands for the \\"idea\\" (thought, intellect, conscious mind), whereas feminine principle stands for \\"emotion\\" (energy, power, subconscious mind).  Just as it takes a man and a woman to create a baby, so it takes an idea merged with emotion to manifest it into physical reality.  An idea gives shape to that which we desire to manifest, whereas the intensity of emotion charges it with energy, gives it power to manifest.  Both arise out of One source - God - Superconscious.itations into his subconscious mind and will have to experience them in his life.

In that respect, it will prove as an invaluable guide if you are using Aura Soma products.<br /><br />As for the esoteric information presented in this book - at times it is botched up and it seems that the authors themselves were confused.  At the beginning of the book they quote Pelham stating that his work (creating flower essences) is not like alchemy because he considers \\"alchemy as something egocentric, for the alchemist sees him or herself as one who creates something\\".  All that I can say is that the individual is truly ignorant of alchemy and genuine alchemists because the goal of alchemy is just the same as of any spiritual tradition - Self-realization, realization of Oneness with All, realization that all is spiritual and it is impossible to engage in true alchemy without bringing Spirit into equasion.  Alchemy is about transmutation of one's \\"lower nature\\", or one's \\"mortal self\\" (mortal consciousness) into spiritual,<br /><br />Aura-Soma system is, according to this book, conceived upon the Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah), and Vicky Wall, being of Hassidic background has some initial challenge naming one of the products \\"Christ\\".  The authors took care to point out that this product is not named after the \\"historical\\" Christ, but after Christ consciousness.  I may add that for some people this distinction doesn't really exist - after all, Christ (historical) did get the \\"title\\" Christ, as he attained \\"Christ consciousness\\" (a realization of Oneness with All).<br /><br />There are many products which are named after an assortment of ascended masters (by the way, among others, there is also St. Germain, who is very well known as an \\"alchemist\\").  Instead of perhaps simply saying that the products are intended to stimulate the vibrations in the user that are represented by these \\"masters\\", the authors have brought in Theosophy as a \\"convincer\\" of the existence of the masters.  While there is a rather lengthy discourse on Theosophy, there is hardly anything in those quotations said about the \\"masters\\" and I think that the best way for any individual to learn more about \\"masters' specific vibrations\\" is through personal experience.<br /><br />Perhaps, they should've just left the products speak for themselves, because they truly are wonderful and they will work for you even if you simply follow your intuition and your inner guidance in picking the right ones.  My original choice of products, before reading this book, did not change - if anything it became reinforced and I may add that I had many wonderful experiences with thes products from the very first day I began using them.  The colors are feast for the eyes, and the herbal essences and scents make you feel as if your mind and heart, soul and body are nourished and uplifted.  I've also had some very interesting dreams, so all I can say about the products I have been tremendously enjoying them and find that they have enriched my life.user that are represented by these \\"masters\\", the authors have brought in Theosophy as a \\"convincer\\" of the existence of the masters.

It contains a little bit of everything dealing with color: how colors influence people's emotions and behavior, the use of colors in decorating and clothing, a bit of feng shui, use of color in healing, a touch of colors in auras, an overview of Aura Soma Products - pomanders and equilibrium oils and much more.  The seven pomanders which are included in this set are a sheer delight - they are very brightly colored and have lovely scents - some are more fruity, some are more spicy - and while I generally don't like any commercial perfumes, I love these pomanders.  From the very first day, they have stimulated some very interested dreams and I have found them very uplifting.<br /><br />It also crossed my mind that this Color Box would make a wonderful gift.	2005-02-13

All genuine power is born out of love.  Yet genuine love doesn't mean fulfilling someone's every whim, but knowing when it's the right time to help and when it's the right time to let the other person grow on his own.  In other words, yes, you can help others, but you are not meant to live another's life. Each one of us has lessons to learn and to grow and it is through personal application that we develop greater power.  This book also teaches you how to find out what you really want, so that you can live your life through to your deeper self - not to chase things in life you were never meant to go after.  And many people do that - instead of listening to their own hearts, they try to live someone else's life.  The book than teaches you how to create what you desire in your life using energy and consciousness - accessing your inner power and focusing it on your outcome.  If you apply what you learn in this book - you will become more empowered, wiser, and happier - and you will be able to be of service to others in a way that is appropriate for you and for them - in a way that will genuinely contribute to mutual growth.	2005-02-05

There are times when you will experience even instant results - if you were in the midst of adversity and choose to deliberately focus your mind upon the idea that \\"something good will come out of (even) that situation\\", you may be surprised to discover how things can turn around.

When you do live from this state of consciousness, you become centered.  Non-attachment, which is also dealt with in this book - becomes in a way a natural side-effect of the entire process - because the only thing you desire, the only little prayer that you have is \\"Thy will be done\\".  When you live your daily life fully aware of, and feeling and expressing the presence of your Greater Self, you don't need to hope or believe that it is there - you KNOW it, and you TRUST it wholeheartedly - you know that it is your best friend and that it has your best interests at heart - so you let it express through you freely - and you know that it doesn't matter what may come or go out of your life - whatever you may ever need will be always supplied to meet all of your needs.

This book doesn't deal with either of those, but rather it deals with traits that may not be so obvious, unless you're informed and know what to look for, traits that may confuse you and make you wonder is something wrong with you or is it him?<br /><br />You will also get insight into what can be salvaged and whether it's worth your while sticking around, or should you better leave before you get deeply entangled - in other words:  what to find out before you find yourself in a deeply messy situation that may be harder and more complicated to get out of as time goes by.<br /><br />At the end of the book, there is a short overview of The Dirty Seven Sisters: Men Beware.  The author has also written a separate book that deals with undesirable traits women bring into a relationship and in my opinion, people of both sexes who desire to enjoy long-term relationships may want to read both books.  After all, it takes two well-adjusted individuals to create a happy, loving and harmonious long-term relationship and having insight into one's own shortcomings and doing something about them is as useful as being aware of what to look for in a relationship partner.	2005-01-29

If you color in this book, you need to use color pencils or crayons else the color will bleed through the pages.<br /><br />The author suggests to hold your left hand over the mandala for a while to absorb / align with its energy.  I have found, though that whether I hold my left hand or not, I can feel the designs act in a certain way to different parts of my body (not only on my mind or emotions), some relaxing and calming, other energizing.

The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that just like other material I read from Doreen - it is all over the place and and incomplete.  Here's what I mean.  She has attempted to put in this book someone from just about every imaginable tradition, but if you are involved with any of these traditions, you'll wonder what happened to the other guys and girls.  So, you'll find a variety of archangels and ascended masters.  Then there's a mishmash of deities from different religions - they seemd to have been just randomnly picked up.  For example, out of 8 Famous Taoist Immortals - one is mentioned here.  From India you'll find Ganesha, Lakshmi, and of all the other choices - there's Kali (careful there, you may be mightily surprised with the effects of working with Kali).  Shiva would've been a better choice.  A good suggestion from esoteric circles is that you should work with the energies (and entities) that resonate with you and that you are acquainted with on a deeper level.  There is always an exchange of energy in the universe and the price you pay for favors granted may not always be what you expected.<br /><br />You'll find a handful of Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Hindu, Celtic, British, Irish, Welsh - as well as sainths and mythical characters from literature (yap, even Guinevere found her honorable place here).<br /><br />If you've ever worked with an entire pantheon of deities from any tradition, you'd be aware that each has distinctly different vibrations.  You'll also get the most out of working with any of them through great devotion and deepening of connection with that particular deity's or archangel's energy.  This book is as if it were written for dabblers  - for people who'd like to have a little bit of taste of everything, but not commit to anything, or who are yet to discover what resonates with them.<br /><br />As far as pagan deities are involved in this book, I can only imagine that if you are involved in practicing any of those religions or esoteric systems - Kaballah, Alchemy (western or Taoist), Greek or Roman or Egyptian or Celtic or any other group of energies, deities and archetypes in a well-structured format, for the purpose of gaining some deeper connection and insights from that particular tradition, this book will leave you wondering where's the rest.ed in practicing any of those religions or esoteric systems - Kaballah, Alchemy (western or Taoist), Greek or Roman or Egyptian or Celtic or any other group of energies, deities and archetypes in a well-structured format, for the purpose of gaining some deeper connection and insights from that particular tradition, this book will leave you wondering where's the rest.	2005-01-22

It combines the great beauty of Renaissance art and bookmaking with the text of the Bible considred by many to be the finest prose in the English language, that of the King James version.  The design for this edition is based on one of the mastterpieces of fifteenth-century art and bookmaking, the incomparable two-volume Latin Vulgate Bible commissioned by Federigo di Monefeltro, duke of Urino.  This rare treasure was completed by the Florentine book dealer Vespasiano da Bisticci in 1478, its text having taken the scribe Ugo Comminelli of Mezieres four years to compose by hand.  The numerous illustratos that grace the parchment of the Urbino Bible were handpainted by such masters as Domenico and Davide Ghirlandaio, among others.<br /><br />This volume contains all of the major illustrations in the Urbino Bible and features many other artistic details from that book, such as decorative borders, column dividers, and illuminated and historiated initial capitals.

From spiritual perspective NONE of us is from the physical realm and ALL of us have a PURPOSE, and a place in this world.  This book is apparently attended to help people who don't know yet what to do with themselves or their lives to discover it - but it's written more in a way to provide explanations or it seems at times - excuses - for why your life doesn't seem to be working or where did you get all those personality quirks (You know what? EVERYONE has them). Based on the description of your individual quirks and interests, when you read the descriptions of these categories - some of which are rather generic and written in the style of newspaper astrological column - you may get an uncanny feeling - you're from another planet or another dimension of experience. Great - so what?  Now, perhaps you'll feel you belong somewhere or maybe it flashes across your mind that you are a creative being and that you have come to this planet to create something beautiful and meaningful and that there's more to you then you considered before.  If you've been repeatedly told your entire life that you're \\"strange\\" and \\"different\\", and things like \\"do you know that 99% of people on this planet do not think like you do\\", and you discover that the descriptions from one or more categories in this book actually fit you rather well (even perfectly), you will get that sense of comfort, even inner satisfaction that by some other standards (uncommon among the people you are surrounded by in your daily life) you're not all that weird after all and that there may be some good and useful reason why you are the way you are.  If it brings you a sense of greater peace and it inspires you to develop and express your innate talents and abilities and to do something constructive with your life, to follow your heart and be of service to others, then I suppose this book has fulfilled its purpose for you.<br /><br />In any event, whatever you may consider to be your origin, you are HERE NOW - to learn, to grow, to express your talents and abilities in a way that is of benefit to you and to others.  Whatever our individual backgrounds and interests, we are all here to share our talents and abilities and to grow in spiritual understanding, to overcome personal limitations and develop the ability to love.  In that respect, wherever you may have come from - in time and space (it's all an illusion, a dream  anyway - spiritually speaking) won't be any more helpful than discovering you were Queen of Sheba in a past life.  (So what if you were?)<br /><br />Discovering the meaning and the purpose of one's life, and discovering inner peace, comes from looking deep inside of one's heart, from awareness of one's spiritual nature and from living one's daily life from spiritual perspective.

Except that all th cards relate to 15 archangels from Jewish, Christian and Islamic texts - there is no unity, harmony, balance and focus neither in design nor in the messages.  The messages, too are all over the place.<br /><br />Here are some of the messages from this deck:<br /><br />\\"Breathe - Take several deep breaths ...\\"<br /><br />\\"Call upon me to open your chakras using sacred geometry\\"<br /><br />\\"Clear Your Space - Get rid of clutter,clear the energy around you and use feng shui\\"<br /><br />As far as decks with messages go - there is another deck \\"Messages from the Universe\\" that at least has more universal and generally usable form of messages.<br /><br />As far as oracles go - nothing beats I Ching or Tarot.<br /><br />Images of the cards that are used as oracles are supposed to work like alchemical emblems.  The symbolism of their design is intended to trigger deeper understanding and wisdom, much alike zen koans and bring it into one's conscious awareness.<br /><br />There is no particular symbolism related to energies and vibrations of particular archangels on these cards (hint to the author:  the imagery used in Kabbalistic Lesser Banishing ritual contains such imagery related to four archangels).  These cards - well, they have no depth. They are not designed for any deeper spiritual awakening or understanding.<br /><br />All in all - yes, you may find the messages you pick soothing, uplifting, inspiring and appropriate and yes, you may enjoy the general loveliness of the cards and the deck may be useful to you.  It may be a nice addition to your collection of divination tools.  I have just found other tools - such as I Ching - more useful in terms of connecting to one's deeper wisdom, connecting with the divine, and gaining a better conscious understanding of universal (divine) patterns.r collection of divination tools.

Whenever I stop exercising for a while and start to feel stiff all over - I fondly remember this book.  And each time anew I am amazed how much more in only 28 days my body becomes flexible.  There were times I wished Richard wrote a 365 day exercise plan, because often when I get to the end of the book, instead of continuing the practice, I stop doing the exercises.  Then, later on, I return to it and start again from the beginning.  In any event, if you want to become more flexible and like to have a wonderful exercise plan to follow, get this book.  It's excellent!  You, too will be amazed with results.	2005-01-17

While living on light - or pure energy is possible and there are people (bretharians) who have successfully trained themselves to be sustained by pure energy / light - there are people who have purachsed this book and went ahead of themselves.  Just as I bought this book and shared it with a friend, who, too is aware of a few genuine bretharians - she brought me an article from the newspaper, about some people who have read this book, stopped eating food and then dropped dead.  There are many amazing things we can do with our minds and with our bodies, but all of them require a good deal of preparation, so 21 day program in this book won't really cut it for vast majority of people.  Personally, I think that one should first practice fasting for a day or two or as long as comfortable (without feeling hungry), and while fasting engage in intense spiritual practice - and find out how long you can last without any food or water and not feel hungry or thirsty.  If you're feeling hungry or thirsty, your body is simply not ready to give up food and water, so there's no point in stretching your experiment to the point of killing yourself in the process.	2005-01-17

It is based on ideas and principles suggested by Bateson and Erickson.  At times the book suggests that just about everything is a metaphor (Bateson's viewpoint), as opposite to a chair being just a chair - the only merit of this observation is that we assign meanings to objects and experiences in our lives and thus to a lesser or greater extent they are colored by our perception.  The book also emphasizes Erickson's utilization principle, namely that the therapist should attempt to use client's metaphors to help the client solve the problem.<br /><br />The authors then guide you through methods and techniques of selecting appropriate symbols, constructing metaphoric stories and ceremonies.

Yet, in this book, a \\"soul mate\\" is a person who helps the individual to grow spiritually so that he can bring out the wholeness that is already within each person.<br /><br />The \\"soul mate\\" term also implies that one has shared a lifetime or more with another before, that they already know each other on a deeper level.  In that respect, one has many soulmates.  Ultimately, though, from a spiritual perspective where all is One and all are connected - everyone is everyone else's soul mate.<br /><br />This book explores different types of soulmate relationships - intimate relationships / marital partners, family members, friends, groups with soul mates joined in the common purpose, and twin souls.  Each is illustrated with numerous stories from Edgar Cayce's readings (files).<br /><br />The distinction between soul mates and twin souls in this book is mainly based upon the purpose of the relationship:  while the focus of soul mate relationship is on the individual's spiritual growth, the main purpose of twin soul relationship is a working on a common purpose - a life-work for the benefit of others, which neither could fulfill alone.<br /><br />The spiritual growth and sharing doesn't involve only the growth of two individuals, but also sharing of a common goal that is bigger than the two individuals; some kind of a contribution to the wellbeing of others, which neither of these people could do alone, so that are put together, so to speak, to create this masterpiece, a contribution for the greater good of all, an aspect of their destiny, they can only do together.<br /><br />The soul attraction goes beyond attraction on the physical level.  Sometimes people are instantly attracted to the particular soulmate, sometimes initially they may not even be all that interested, but certain chain of events eventually opens them up to this inner realization and feeling that they have been together before, a feeling of familiarity with another that goes beyond physical level.<br /><br />The relationships between soulmates are not always easy and rosy - as a matter of fact, most of the time they have to overcome a lot of challenges and a lot of individual differences and it may take a lot of work.  What keeps them together, more than anything else, is this commitment to the higher purpose that is bigger than they are, an undeniable inner knowingness that they are meant to do something together.times initially they may not even be all that interested, but certain chain of events eventually opens them up to this inner realization and feeling that they have been together before, a feeling of familiarity with another that goes beyond physical level.

It has a certain tone you may encounter when watching commercials - fast paced yelling (like a banshee), in desperate attempt to hold your attention, yet a style that made reading a book a torment - as did her adjectives related to men.  (OK, it must be me - I don't appreciate disparaging comments or putting people down, especially not those I'd consider worthwhile sharing my time with).  Makes me wonder, how good about herself a person genuinely feels if she (or he) has to refer to others with derrogatory adjectives.<br /><br />A good deal of this book is dedicated to promoting the author's online dating website.  At times it seems that it was the author's main intent behind writing this book.  Nothing wrong with promoting her website or suggesting online dating as yet another avenue of possibly finding the man of your choice, but as you begin reading her book and every few pages you encounter \\"join my online dating service\\" - you begin to feel as if you're reading commercial after commercial after commercial.  One commercial break every few pages - just as if you were watching a TV (and one of the reasons, I don't watch TV).<br /><br />The premise behind getting a man in 6 weeks is that it only takes 30 seconds for a man to decide whether he would be interested in a woman or not - therefore, ultimately it only takes you 30 seconds to give the man the impression that you are the one and he's yours - at least for another 30 seconds, few hours or one-night stand.  As to whether he would be your dream man and whether you'd be together more than than sharing a spicy weekend or two is debatable.<br /><br />It takes much more than 30 seconds for people to discover what they have in common, how valuable they are to each other, how compatible they are and whether they share their lives to any greater extent.<br /><br />From that perspective, the book is truly shallow.  What you will find in this book is how to get a man's attention and possibly create that initial \\"click\\" - how to act so that a man finds you desirable and perhaps becomes intrigued to get to  know better - at least until he gets what he's after.<br /><br />The author does list numerous places where you may go hunting for possible candidates.  Yes, it is a common sense that if you desire to find a man, you go to places which are frequented mostly by men - such as sports events, in which case I hope you truly enjoy the particular sport and are not attending the event because you are truly desperate or afraid of being alone.<br />One of her \\"wise\\" suggestions is dressing sexy and walking into a man's washroom.  Good luck to you!<br /><br />There are many other places and if you are a woman who has a rich life with many interests, your best bet would be meeting someone who shares some of those interests you are passionate about.  If you have a fulfilling life, then you won't be needy, so you won't have to play the games and pretend that you're not lonely and desperate for having a man.  If you are desperate, no matter what you do on the outside, and how well you think you can fake it, sooner or later, that desperation will show.<br />If you are happy with your life, with or without a man, then you'll be able to focus on sharing the time together because both of you enjoy it and have something valuable to share with each other, so you'll want to be together again and again, after that initial click is long gone.<br /><br />As the previous reviewer noted - there are many other books with much better suggestions and of much higher quality.s attention and possibly create that initial \\"click\\" - how to act so that a man finds you desirable and perhaps becomes intrigued to get to  know better - at least until he gets what he's after.

I believe that every woman could benefit from reading it and gain some insights.<br /><br />There are many authors who have attempted to bring across some of points presented in this book, but have for the most part botched them up and in their presentations missed the mark.<br /><br />This book is very sound and the advice is healthy, both in relation to women and in relation to men.<br /><br />After all happy and mutually fulfilling and respectful relationships are not based on neediness, but on each party contributing and sharing the gifts they bring into the relationship.  Both needy and abrasive behaviors point to some kind of insecurity and inadequacy the woman has within.  Self-assured woman, a woman who has a fulfilling life even without a man, doesn't have anything to prove or do for the sake of approval.  She also doesn't feel like a martyr.  She shares herself out of her choice and for the sake of mutual enjoyment.  She never has to do what she doesn't feel comfortable doing.  That doesn't mean that she is selfish or that she takes advantage of a man in any way, but rather that sharing is respectful and reciprocal.  There is no permanent happiness in any relationship without some kind of a balanced exchange of energy, with both parties wanting to share their gifts and contributions, rather than feel in any way forced to do so.<br /><br />Way to go Sherry!

Just as women in general are known to be full of contraditions, so is the advice that runs through this book - some examples of using charm in many different situations are brilliant.  On the other hand, you'll encounter a struggle to be proper and ethical, advice to think positively, believe in the good, and to look at situations in optimistic light mixed with hold on patiently to your grievances (2 - 5 years or more if need be) until the timing is perfect to dish out your revenge. (That's definitely not good for one's health.) Then in the next section, you'll find \\"let bygones be bygones\\".<br /><br />And yes, there is an advice in the book to be used in negotiations.  Since most of the books on negotiation out there are written by guys, here is how it works from Southern woman's perspective - together with the negotiation skills available through other books and sources, wear a short skirt [the shorter the skirt you wear, the better deal you can count on getting], use charm all the way, and let your opponent sizzle (for his own good) - very soon he won't know what hit him.<br /><br />All in all, it is an entertaining book.	2004-11-29

The bottom line is - the techniques work.<br /><br />Even though the book is geared toward making people fall in love - the bottom line is that it is about establishing rapport with people you'd like to have around, so many of the techniques can be used by anyone in daily life to establish and maintain harmonious relationships.  After all, letting know someone that you appreciate them and letting them know what you genuinely like about them, will help in any relationship - amorous or professional.<br /><br />There are degrees of bonding you may want to have with different people and it's up to you how deep a bond you desire to develop with someone.  It is also useful to know what we do that gets people hooked and attached, so that we don't do it with people we don't want to chase us.  Sometimes people unconsciously do the \\"right\\" thing with those they don't want, and the \\"wrong\\" thing with those they do want - so it's good to be conscious of the effects of one's behavior and influence upon others.<br /><br />An entire section of this book deals with - oh, I prefer to call it \\"a balance of energy exange\\" rather than what seems to be a popular phrase, \\"one's market value\\".  It is an important issue, not just for attracting someone into your life, but also for maintaining harmonious relationship on a long-term basis - again whether the relationship is amorous or professional.  The successful long-term relationships are based on mutual contribution to the relationship - the qualities and \\"assets\\" each person brings into a relationship may be different, but they will have to balance out in some way.<br /><br />The book does have some lovely techniques for developing deep level or rapport and intimacy fast, by using one's verbal and non-verbal language to shift gears from \\"I\\" and \\"you\\" into \\"we\\".<br /><br />The material covered in this book is not all-encompassing, though.  You can learn much more from the field of Neuro-Linguistic Programming.not all-encompassing, though.

After all, other people will treat you the way you treat yourself and even if someone gives you a compliment, but you consider yourself to be undeserving and unworthy, if you don't really like yourself, it may be hard to believe that anyone else would like you either.  But it is a question of genuinely assessing your assets and your value, rather than just walking around with your nose up.  For a happy and lasting relationship - the appreciation has to be mutual.  If the relationship is not based on integrity and trust, it ain't going to last.  Tricking someone into a relationship won't lead to lasting happiness.<br /><br />I did give this book three stars because I think it's useful being aware and knowing different tricks, even if you're never going to use them, or if you're using them and then one day discover that even though you \\"captured\\" someone, you're not feeing that good about yourself or about your relationship.<br /><br />I got this book some 7 years ago, when I was already in a relationship with a person who perfectly qualified for these techniques (he did deserve them as he was practicing something along the same lines himself).  Instead of getting out of the relationship (which I did anyway afterwards), I tried some of these techniques and they worked instantly.  I was amazed.  The only problem was that it took too much work playing the games - so I stopped after a week.<br /><br />I chose another method later on - based on what I truly desired in my heart.  I assessed where I want to go with my life, what are my preferences in life and what kind of a person would best fit into my life as a life-long companion, with common interests and qualities.  Then I asked the Higher Power to bring into my life the person that is best suited for me and let go.  I didn't go chasing anyone.  I trusted that the person with whom I could have the most mutually beneficial and rewarding relationship will cross my path and shortly afterwards he did.  All relationships need some work, but at least the work both of us invested in this relatinship was based on mutual growth and support, not on playing manipulative games. Both of us do know a good deal of seduction tricks, but when we use them with each other it's to spice up and deepen the relationship, not to trick another.  Without mutual integrity, respect, appreciation and genuine sharing - no relationship will go far.uld have the most mutually beneficial and rewarding relationship will cross my path and shortly afterwards he did.

As anything else it requires practice - in this case, practice using self-hypnosis, and the power of your mind.  If you don't have experience using self-hypnosis, you may get better results getting the entire program with recordings that guide you through the entire photoreading process.  Part of the process involves getting into the right state of mind and photographing the pages of the book you intend to read, and the second part involves recalling the information - bringing it out of your subconscious mind.<br /><br />Whether you use Photoreading system or not, you will get more out reading and absorbing the information you read, if you begin with \\"intention\\" - deciding what is the purpose of your reading, what it is that you desire to gain from reading and then first getting the overview of the material you are about to read.<br /><br />There may be times when you'd like to savor the material you read, where photoreading system may help with retention and with finding your way around lots of material you desire to absorb faster, but which you still want to read in an old-fashioned way - fully immersing yourself with all of your senses into the material you read and re-living it.  But, for the times when you need to go over huge amounts of material in a short period of time, photoreading can come in very handy.  At first, when you photoread, it may seem that you don't remember anything that you read, but then you may be amazed when you need that information and you discover that it is just pouring out of you.<br /><br />While I personally use photoreading once in a while, some of my friends always photoread every book and have become very, very skilled in using this method over the years.  The bottom line is it works and I'm sure there will be times when you'll find it very useful.	2004-11-11

The essence of one's success with lucid dreaming though, IS, intention to dream lucidly.<br /><br />You may be surprised with how many things you can accomplish just like that by beginning with a state of mind that it is easy to accomplish, that it is natural for you to accomplish it, intending the effect and expecting it.<br /><br />It may take you more time to experience lucid dreaming if you have never invested any effort to work intentionally with your subconscious mind, but on the other hand, if you are experienced working with self-hypnosis, you may find yourself having a lucid dream just by reading through the book because it would plant a suggestion in your subconscious.  Perhaps you have already had experiences where you watched something on TV just before going to sleep and then dreaming about it; or reading something before going to sleep and then dreaming about it - it can be as easy as that.<br /><br />And yes, the practice of conditioning your mind to be aware that you are, even now, awake in your dream - works.  Again, if you have never engaged in any spiritual practice, or working with your mind, it may seem that there is a distinction between the \\"dream\\" of your waking life (the time when you believe that you are fully awake) and the dreams you dream during the night - but if you'd engage in creating outcomes intentionally in your daily life with your mind - your daily life would soon begin to feel like a dream, just a projection from your mind - one moment you think about something - and the next moment you experience it in your outer reality.<br /><br />There is a distinction, though - as you'll find yourself able to do certain things while dreaming with your physical body asleep, which you are not able to do with your physical body - such as fly - so any such unusual experiences can serve as a wonderful \\"cue\\" to alert you to the fact that you are dreaming and help you to become lucid.that you are dreaming and help you to become lucid. <br />	2004-11-11

Its Chinese name is the T'ai Shang Ch'in-ching Ching.  Cultivating stillness is a short text of twenty-four segments.  An exoteric interpretation will produce a reading of Taoism that focuses on the ideas of wu-wei, simplicity, and peaceful and harmonious living.  An esoeric interpretation will reveal hidden instructions on internal alchemy and meditation, nd will offer advice on a lifestyle that is conducive to the cultivation of health and longevity.<br /><br />Taoist methods of health, longevity, and immortality were often presented in the esoteric terminology of alchemy, which was intended both to reveal and to hide.  To those initiated in the practice, the symbolism revealed a world of inner experience.

A subscriber wrote in, saying that he had found a spider in his paper and asked whether this was a sign of good or bad uck.  Twain answered:<br /><br />\\"Dear Subscriber:  Finding a spider in your paper was neither good luck nor bad luck for you. The spider was merely looking over our paper to see which merchant is not advertising so that he can go to that store, spin his web across the door and lead a life of undisturbed peace ever afterward.\\"<br /><br />ADVICE<br /><br />It is beter to give than receive - especially advice.  Mark Twain was always willing to donate free advice to the needy and the unsuspecting.  \\"It's notble to be good\\", he said, \\"and it's nobler to teach others to be good, and less trouble.\\"<br /><br />Whenever you find that you are on the side of majority, it is time to reform (- or pause and reflect).<br /><br />BELIEFS<br /><br />If the man doesn't believe as we do, we say he is a crank, and that settles it.  I mean, it does nowadays, because now we can't burn him.<br /><br />SURGERY<br /><br />Mark Twain offered this advice on the proper state of mind for undergoing surgery:  \\"Console yourself with the reflection that you are giving the doctor pleasure, and that he is getting paid for it.\\"<br /><br />INSULTS<br /><br />When Mark Twain disapproved of someone, he was not likely o keep it a secret.  A remark he made on hearing of the death of an annoying person is typical:<br /><br />\\"He has done a thing for me which I wouldn't even have done for myself.  If he will only stay dead now I will call the account square and drop the grudge I bear him.\\"	2004-11-05

Good beginner program for learning to read and write Chinese characters would be Easy Chinese Tutor.<br /><br />This program does guide you through grammar, and the best part of the program are numerous drills - my favorite being \\"substitution exercises\\" which help to thoroughly assimilate the material covered in each lesson.<br /><br />In all the years of learning numerous foreign languages and working with many different methods and courses, I have found the drills provided through FSI language programs, to lead to the fastest proficiency in mastering the language.	2004-11-05

This is a great book with thorough instructins on working with mantras.  The only issue I had relates to gurus, which these books suggests one should have - though for those who really feel that they must have one, there are at least some decent admonishions in choosing one wisely.  Just because one poses as a guru, doesn't necessarily make him neither an enlightened individual, nor someone who has your best interests at heart - so do watch out.  I also think it best that one should follow one's inner wisdom and inner guidance.<br /><br />The focus of this book is more on the details related to the practice, rather than the diveristy of mantras.  Several mantras are provided, together with interesting stories relating to the experiences of the author and others who have used them.	2004-11-05

The author guides you step-by-step through alchemical symbolism and alchemical operations as they relate to different psychological processes.<br /><br />The alchemical recipes expressed through different alchemical operations presented in this book are intended to help you create desired psychological transformation - whether you desire to apply them in your therapeutic practice or to gain further insights and effect the desired transformation in yourself.<br /><br />Understanding of alchemy is based on practical application and as the author points out \\"Unlike medical prescriptions, alchemical recipes require full engagement of the mind, body and soul, as well as active participation of the imaginative faculty to make them work.\\" [As a hypnotist, I may add, that this truth applies to successful work with hypnosis, too].<br /><br />The author does quote excerpts from Corpus Hermeticum - and this particular excerpt is the jewel of the Corpus Hermeticum:<br /><br />\\"Rise up above every height: descend deeper than any depth;<br /><br />Concentrate into thyself all the sensations of created things<br /><br />Of water, fire, dry and wet.<br /><br />Think of finding yourself simultaneously everywhere in the<br /><br />Earth, sea and sky;<br /><br />Think of having never been born,<br /><br />Of still being an embryo;<br /><br />Young and old, dead and beyond death,<br /><br />Embrace everything at the same time;<br /><br />All times, places, things, qualities and quantities.\\"<br /><br />The author also at times draws parallels from the world of quantum physics, and other spiritual and esoteric traditions,<br /><br />to ellucidate specific points he desires to make.	2004-11-05

Thomas Ashley-Farrand writes insightful and informative books - and I like all of them - and I also enjoy his recordings with mantras.<br /><br />Together with mantras and their applications, he also provides lot of interesting stories about people who used them and the effects the use of mantras had upon their lives.<br /><br />Some stories also relate to abuse of mantras, or rather inner power one has developed; while some also point out that it's not only mechanical repetition of mantras that brings desired results, but also investment of one's energy, belief and expectation in their effectiveness [e.g. self-hypnosis].<br /><br />Mantras do help to focus your mind on a desired outcome, to align you vibrationally with certain frequencies - but you'll also find stories of different people using the same mantra and getting quite different results [the determining factor here being one's belief and expectation].<br /><br />Together with this book, I do recommend his recordings.  All in all, you can sing a good deal of your problems away and align yourself with vibrations of love, health, peace, abundance, happiness, and anything else your heart desires.	2004-11-05

Since these limitations arise from one's perception, hypnotic language is for the most part directed at altering one's perception, helping the individual to rise above the limitation and become aware of the solution.<br /><br />Many examples in this book include metaphors where specific hypnotic language patterns have been incorporated.  The author provides an insightful analysis of the problems presented together with hypnotic language patterns used and the solutions that manifested as a result of them.<br /><br />At the end of the book is an overview of the Milton Model - meta-model violations: deletions, distortions, generalizations, complex equivalences, cause-effect, etc. followed by specific language patterns for artful vagueness: double binds, phonological ambiguities, embedded commands, conversational postulates, etc.	2004-11-01

Adam McLean has contributed a great deal of effort in assisting people who desire to work with alchemical emblems get the most of them, through this book and through his wonderful courses related to alchemical emblems.<br /><br />This his work both of coloring emblems and helping us to work with them, he has brought them to life.  They are not longer just breathtaking images, but a vivid reality one gets to experience in meditation and contemplation.<br /><br />I particularly appreciate Adam McLean's admonishion that one should not interpret the emblems using the symbolism from other traditions that just doesn't fit here, but work only with what is present.<br /><br />Alchemical emblems work in a way just like zen koans do - there is a point where in order to grasp the meaning, to exprience them, you have to drop your preconceived ideas and let the emblem speak to you and through you.  The emblematic images, through meditation upon the symbolism, eventually bring forth the knowledge that is already present deep within, but is yet out of conscious awareness.  Through contemplation upon the emblems, this deep inner wisdom bursts into conscious awareness, not in words, but in knowingness and deep realization of the truth.	2004-10-30

The lovely thing about personal instruction is you are guided step-by-step through the practice.  The problem is that over the years there are bits and pieces of information that you forget.  Many years later on I also got the Mantak Chia's videos - just about all of them, including the ones for Fursion of the Five Elements and I highly recommend them.  It's like having Mantak Chia in your own room, guiding you step by step.<br /><br />Then I got this book and I'm so glad I did because in this book I found even more information, more advanced practices and imagery that was not covered in the video.<br /><br />Before you begin working with the practices in this book you should know how to work with Microcosmic Orbit.  That is covered in few of Mantak Chia's previous books \\"Awaken the Healing Energy of Tao\\" and \\"Awaken the Healing Light of Tao\\".<br /><br />In Taoist Alchemy emotions are considered to be stored in different organs: lungs, heart, spleen, kidneys and liver.  Fuson of the Five Elements involves working with the imagery and healing sounds which help to transmute the negative aspects of energy into positive in each of the organs, and then gathering the purified energy into appropriate collection points, establishing it in four paquas (baguas), fusing it and then creating a pearl, circulating it around the microcosmic orbit, shooting it out, forming another body, absorbing more energy and bring it back into the physical body. That's just the first level.<br /><br />The practice extensive use of your power to create vivid images.  The effects of the practice are noticeble from the very beginning.  If the practice seems too complex, go ahead and get videos.  They will make the entire process very easy to do.  The practice is actually much easier to do then to describe.	2004-10-30

In this book Dennis takes the verses from the Emerald Tablet, as a pattern for seven stages of alchemical transformation, and applies it to different areas of human development.  He provides numerous examples which are intended to facilitate the understanding of each stage of alchemical transformation, but in my opinion, some of these examples don't quite make it.<br /><br />The book will nevertheless be very helpful to a beginner to get an idea about the seven stages of alchemical transformation - to actually know them, one will have to experience them - and the later stages of alchemical transformation seem to be beyond the scope of this book - at least I have that impression based on the examples provided.	2004-10-30

They have all worked beautifully - actually some have worked way better than I expected and they taught me some other lessons about the importance of mastering the control over one's thoughts and emotions, alongside with playing with power.<br /><br />This is not really a Wiccan book.  It is eclectic book and mixes deities from an assortment of traditions. It has nothing to do with any religion, merely with using different tools to help you focus your mind on your outcomes effectively, helping you to create outstanding results.<br /><br />If you use it a lot, eventually, you will not need the external tools any more - but will be able to rely fully and completely on using the power of your mind alone.  The book will help you to train your mind.<br /><br />A note on the \\"spells\\" in this book.  They are beautifully written as a rhyme.  Now, 20 years later, I still remember them.  Using a rhyme is very effective way to impress ideas upon your subconscious mind.<br /><br />When I began using this book, I was experimenting with everything, just to see what happens.  In those experiments I was repeating the \\"spells\\" verbatim as they are written, out of curiosity, and well, some things manifested in interesting ways, the wordings from those spells, even though I didn't really care to have them manifest.  As you learn to write your own spells, you may incorporate the wording in them that you're certain you'd like to experience, because your subconscious mind has a tendency to accept everything literally, and then create it in your experience.<br /><br />In any event, this book is bound to bring you many interesting experiences.	2004-10-29

More advanced practice of transmutation of negative energy is covered in the book Fusion of the Five Elements, however before you'd work with that one, you'd have to learn Microcosmic Orbit first.<br /><br />The first practice is called \\"inner smile\\".  In essence this involves focusing upon the smiling, happy, energy and directing it to different parts of your body.  As you relax your mind, emotions and body into this smiling energy, any stress and tension you may feel is bound to be released.<br /><br />The next set of practices covered in this book are six healing sounds.  In Taoist tradition, specific emotions are associated with different organs in your body and so are different sounds which help to clear any energetic obstacles in these organs.  Sounds, and accompaning movements are designed to clear and balance the energy of the particular organ.  Working with healing sounds also involves focusing upon the imagery (in the simplest form a color) associated with the particular organ.<br /><br />Five healing sounds are associated with organs in the body - heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and spleen.  Sixty healing sound is associated not with the organ, but with the triple warmed meridian.  Working with this sixth sound will deeply relax you and if you suffer from insomnia, it may also help you to fall asleep.	2004-10-29

It points to the simple truth - that wealth begins by accessing the resources within and by using one's imagination.<br /><br />Just like some of the reviewers of this book, the protagonist of the story is originally convinced that there is nothing much to be said or had from the power of one's imagination.  He is then led through personal experiences which points to the contrary (it's what in hypnosis, we'd call a \\"suggestibility test\\").<br /><br />The protagonist also learns that to move forward toward the achievement of his dreams he has to dare and to take action.  It's true - world belongs to those who dare to dream and then dare to take action.<br /><br />It is also true that there are numerous other books written on the same topic using more or less similar metaphors and that from that perspective the book may not be original.  But then, this also reminds me of some stories told by Tony Robbins and many others about people complaining that the one instructing them is saying the same thing over and over and over again, wondering if the instructor has become senile and doesn't remember he has said the same thing before, many, many times -<br /><br />to which the instructor replies - \\"yes, and I'll keep on repeating it until you actually put that information to use\\".<br /><br />One doesn't learn from reading the books, no matter how informative books may be.  One learns by using the information.  He ownes it only once he has lived through it in his own experience.<br /><br />The truth is simple, but some people get so very disappointed to hear the simple things over and over again.  They think that in order for something to work, it has to be complicated, so that they have something to do with all their time, spending a life-time getting to something that was so simple and straightforward in the first place - looking for revelations everywere else except where they should go looking in the first place.  All the wealth, financial or wealth of any other kind, whatever a human being may seek, begins right within one's mind.<br /><br />The essential truth about creating wealth will never be anything else than what is portrayed in this book and if metaphors are created and more books are written, the only thing that will change are the protagonists and fillers that make the story interesting.<br /><br />If everyone already KNEW these truths, they wouldn't experience any lack, and until such time, books like these are valuable, because one of them may just do the trick and motivate the individuals suffering from lack to actually use the information.ould go looking in the first place.

At the beginning of the book is a general induction you can use to induce yourself into a trance state, followed by a selection of 35 scripts for dealing with common issues and helping you to improve your life.  You'll find scipts for weight-loss, confidence, motivation, public speaking, lucid dreaming, better sex life and many others.<br /><br />The book is marketed as using hypnosis while you're awake.  This may seem to make it different from other hypnosis books, unless you understand that you are using hypnosis every time you use your imagination and get absorbed by your inner experience - and for that matter any time you read any book that transports you into another world, the world described in that book and you become oblivious to your environment to a certain degree, you are in hypnosis - much like you are in hypnosis when you are absorbed in the action of the movie you are watching on TV.  The only difference is that with TV you get to watch the images, and while reading the book, you create them in your mind, according to your interpretation of the words.<br /><br />You can use the scripts in this book either by reading them, but you can also record them on a tape and just relax and listen to them. You should use whatever method helps you to engage your imagination better and create a more vivid subjective experience.<br /><br />This book was created for non-hypnotists - however even a professional hypnotist, particularly those who are new to hypnosis, may use this book as an additional resource - just as they would use any other script (patter) book.<br /><br />Near the end of the book is a section on hypnotizing yourself while you write.

It will guide you step-by-step in your first experiments with hypnosis.<br /><br />The book provides you with some general overview of hypnosis and areas of use.  It also provides you with hypnosis scripts.  One warning regarding hypnosis scripts in general - any given script may or may not work for you, so instead of using scripts verbatim as they are presented, feel free to alter the wording to meet your particular needs and preferences.<br /><br />The secret to your success with hypnosis is in your ability to use your imagination in a way that the desired outcome will feel REAL to you now.  When you work with pre-written scripts, you may stumble upon some that work perfectly for you and others that will not do much for you.  The entire purpose of the scripts is to help guide your imagination.  Once you become experienced with using self-hypnosis, you won't need any more scripts.  And even if you are practicing hypnosis on others, once you learn it well, then you also won't be using written scripts, but will guide the person into hypnosis in a way that is appropriate for the particular person.<br /><br />But, well, it's true you have to begin somewhere and this book is alright to give you an idea, a taste of hypnosis.  Just keep in mind that there is much more to hypnosis and if you really want to master it, keep reading, learning and experimenting.<br /><br />On the positive side, this book is very easy to read.  It will guide you through some sample sessions, different routines, and different applicatins of hypnosis.<br /><br />There are much better books on hypnosis and if the information provided in this book doesn't work for you, it doesn't mean that you are not a good \\"hypnosis subject\\" - only that another approach may be more suitable for you - so don't stop with this book.	2004-10-29

Gilligan first points out the differences between authoritarian method of using hypnosis, which was common before Erickson entered the picture and the permissive method, indirect hypnosis used by Erickson.  The focus of the book is on what distinguishes Ericksonian hypnosis from traditional hypnosis, namely UTILIZATION of whatever state the client is in to help to liberate the client from the limitation that is at the core of the problem.<br /><br />Instead of forcing the client to fit the hypnotist's modus operandi, the therapist becomes flexible and shapes his approach according to the personality, background, understanding, preferences of the client - thus the therapist co-operates with the client, working together with the client toward facilitating the solution.<br /><br />The main purpose of the hypnotherapist is to help the client to access his inner resources.  Erickson had great faith into the resourcefulness of the client's unconscious mind, and rather than insisting on any particular method, used his skills to help the client draw the resources from within.  This principle was later popularized through one of the NLP presuppositions which states that \\"everyone has all the resources he may need to reach the desired outcome\\".  These resources may not be obvious to one's conscious mind, but they are there - within the individual's unconscious.<br /><br />The reason that the traditional hypnosis sometimes worked and sometimes didn't is because hypnotists learned one method, one script and then used it indiscriminately on everyone.  This unfortunately is still the case with the common hypnosis training which is based entirely upon the methods used in traditional hypnosis.<br /><br />Traditional hypnotist may run into a lot of client resistance, because he is attempting to force one method upon everyone.  Ericksonian hypnotist will utilize the resistance to guide the person into a trance - thus Ericksonian hypnotist cooperates with whatever the client presents and uses that very same thing to help the client.<br /><br />Utilization also implies using the client's model of the world.  If the client's model of the world is limited to the point that it is causing the client to experience the problem, the hypnotist will enter that model of the world and use it, to help the client out.  In order for a hypnotist to be able to do this successfully, he may have to be very flexible and at least temporarily accept the client's model of the world, rather than forcing his own world-view upon the client.  By meeting with the client in client's model of the world, the hypnotist establishes rapport with the client.  Rapport is the most crucial aspect of hypnosis - without it hypnotist won't get anywhere.<br /><br />Learning Ericksonian hypnosis will sky-rocket the success-rate of any hypnotist's practice.rson into a trance - thus Ericksonian hypnotist cooperates with whatever the client presents and uses that very same thing to help the client.   <br /> <br />Utilization also implies using the client's model of the world.

It has a wide selection of suggestibility tests, inductions and routines for stage hypnosis.  It does not deal with therapeutic aspects of hypnosis.<br /><br />Even if you're not interested in stage hypnosis, you can still benefit from learning suggestibility tests and inductions.  Using suggestibility tests will make a great difference when you're using hypnosis on others because they help you to discover the level of rapport you have with the person, the person's willingness and ability to use his imagination, and they also serve as \\"convicers\\" for the person that he has been \\"hypnotized\\", making the person more receptive to further suggestions.  In the end, suggestibility tests, determine the person's willingness to play along at any given time.  If they are not in mood to play along at one time, they may be in better mood to play along at some other time - so you don't need to make any definite conclusions regarding the hypnotizability of a particular person.  Everyone is hypnotizable - just different people may prefer to get into a trance in a different ways at different times.<br /><br />The book continues with different inductions and deepeners you can use.  It's good to experiment with all of them as they can all come in handy at some point.  The variety of methods will also keep learning hypnosis fun.<br /><br />After the section of routines you can do in stage hypnosis, there is a small section of self-hypnosis - how you can use hypnosis to deal with some common issues.  There is much more both to stage hypnosis, and to applications of hypnosis, so when you're finished with this book - keep learning.<br /><br />When you're done with this book, if you want to learn more about \\"stage hypnosis\\" get Ormond McGill's Encyclopedia of Hypnosis.	2004-10-29

Originally I found few of his books ine one small Chinese store, and decided to give them a shot.  I was thrilled when even my very first attempt resulted in noticing the difference.  While the books were wonderful I did wish to have personal instruction, too.  Lucky for me, about few weeks after I purchased the books, Mantak Chia was teaching a workshop in Toronto.  Even though thsee initial practices are rather simple, it helped attending a workshop, too.  I have attended all the workshops he came to teach in Toronto at the time.  In the meantime, videos came out, so in time I got those too.<br /><br />You may or may not want to attend a workshop, but if for any reason you don't feel comfortable proceeding on your own, you may consider getting Mantak Chias videos.  I like them very much (I have just about all of them)  Another excellent resource is the book Qigong Empowerment.<br /><br />The focus of this book, Awaken Healing Energy Through Tao, is learing to circulate the energy through Microcosic Orbit.  It is the essential practice for all future practices in Taoist Alchemy.  The book also gives an overview of practices you can do if you wish to continue with your studies and practice.<br /><br />It is not hard to do.  It is really simple.  If you are new to this, the more complex part than the practice may be the use of different names in chinese for different points and a lot of theoretical information behind the practice.The practice essentially involves guiding the energy with your imagination - generating it, circulating it and storing it in your body.<br /><br />You can experience many benefits of this practice from the very beginning.  What I experienced from the very beginning is a sense of calm.  If I were ever upset and then begin doing microcosmic orbit, the upset would immediately disperse and dissolve.  Doing microcosmic orbit practice had a centering effect.  The practice is very, very simple but the benefits are far greater than may be initially apparent.<br /><br />As you keep on storing the energy, whenever any part of your body (organs) need more energy, they can use the energy you have stored instead of depleting the energy from other parts of your body.  This in itself contributes to health.  However, if you choose to continue your learning, there are many more advanced practices designed specifically for healing.actice is very, very simple but the benefits are far greater than may be initially apparent. <br /> <br />As you keep on storing the energy, whenever any part of your body (organs) need more energy, they can use the energy you have stored instead of depleting the energy from other parts of your body.

The book is about using the power of your subconscious mind.  As I read over some previous reviews here, I noticed that some people stumbled upon the language and pointed out that one should read \\"As A Man Thinketh\\" (yes, it is a good book to read), and made a reference to \\"as you think in your HEART\\" - not mind.  Another name for the SUBCONSCIOUS is HEART of the MIND, because SUBCONSCIOUS MIND is the REALM OF EMOTIONS.<br /><br />Some people also erroneously think that the subconscius mind is in one's head, it isn't.  It is not even confined to your physical body, but permeates it.  Your physical body is IN your MIND.  Another way to describe the subconscious may be to refer to it as your \\"energy field\\" (that may be somewhat more modern \\"language\\").  Do not get stuck to words and labels, though.  They are merely useful to help describe things - they are not the experience itself.<br /><br />To use self-hypnosis successfully, to use the power of your mind successfully, it is not enough to just repeat the words mechanically (although, with a lot of repetition, they too will be impressed upon your subconscious mind), but you must also use your feelings - EXPERIENCING the outcome you desire AS IF it were REAL for you now - subjectively.<br /><br />The term subconscious mind is used to refer to your own individual storehouse of knowledge and memories.  The term \\"superconscious\\", or \\"universal mind\\", \\"God\\", and sometimes in hypnosis the term \\"unconscious\\" are used to refer to the infinite storehouse of knowledge, which you access through your subconscious mind.<br /><br />There is ONLY ONE Mind, but for the convenience we have divided it linguistically into three minds, according to its functions - conscious, subconscious and superconscious.  You can imagine that there is one door standing between your conscious and subconscious mind and another between your subconscious and superconscious.  You access both your subconscious and superconscious by getting the critical faculty of your conscious mind out of the way and the easiest way to do this is by fully engaging your imagination and your emotions.<br /><br />Because you access your subconscious and superconscious mind in the same way, people sometimes just use the term \\"subconscious\\" to refer to both functions.  Instead of using the world superconscious, Murphy sometimes uses he word \\"God\\" - which I like, but some people feel very uncomfortable with due to their religious upbringing or lack of understanding and direct experience (A Course in Miracles is one books that may help in that respect).<br /><br />Your conscious mind is that part of your mind that judges things and contemplates whether you can or cannot do something.  It compares things and when you attempt to use your conscius mind and work on some goal, it may pop up with all the reasons why something may not be possible for you to do.  Your subconscious mind goes for DIRECT EXPERIENCE.  It doesn't judge whether something is possible or impossible, good or bad - it merely ACCEPTS as true and real whatever you EXPERIENCE as REAL subjectively.<br /><br />When you pick a goal to work on with your subconscious, make sure that it is something that is BELIEVABLE to you.  Whatever ideas you desire to impress upon your subconscious mind will work in conjunction with that which is already in your subconcious mind - so if the ideas and beliefs which are currently in your subconscious are in conflict with your desired goal, it will take you a long time to experience the desired results.  If you begin with things you are willing to accept as possible for you, you'll get much faster results and you'll also condition your mind for success and to the world of many new wonderful possibilities.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind, that you are in one way or another programming your subconscious mind with every thought you think.  So, if you are using self-hypnosis to help you create greater abundance and you are working on your goal for half an hour a day, then you spend the other 23 hours contemplating how you don't have money to pay the bills, you're just undoing all that work you invested in self-hypnosis.  Once you are done with your mind-programming, whenever you think of your goal, you'll make it happen much faster if you spend time expecting the positive outcome and giving thanks that what you desire is already yours, or at least that it is on its merry way to you.<br /><br />This lovely book teaches you how to use the power of your mind in many different areas in your life.

When I did finally get to working with it, I was faced with a problem out of which I had no clue how to get out, so I gave my best shot to this book.  I was totally, wholeheartedly committed to working with it and the results paid off beyond my wildest dreams.  I have read many helpful book in my lifetime, but none has such a profound and lasting effect as this one.<br /><br />Working with A Course in Miracles never ends, but the most dramatic changes I have experienced were during that first year, when my perception and experience of the world turned on its head and the world, my relationship to it, my experience of the world, has permanently changed.<br /><br />It's been 11 years since that time, but A Course in Miracles is still alive and well in my mind.<br /><br />There are people who have picked this book, invested half-hearted attempt in working with it and who got seemingly nothing out of it.  Unless you're willing to invest yourself wholeheartedly in working with A Course in Miracles, it's unlikely you'll experience the promises of the book.<br /><br />Sometimes people join groups and go on asking others for advice as to how they should work with this book.  All the instructions are in this book.  There is no one on the outside who will help you to get through the Course.  This is an inner journey and to travel it successfully, you have to be willing to travel deep within - not with parts of you holding onto the outer world.  Only when you are completely willing to drop the outside, will you make it to the other side, in this inner journey.  The treasures are hidden deep within.  Dive in and discover the wonders that are hidden within you.	2004-10-28

Some, feeling quite alive and well, even though without a physical body, couldn't accept the fact that they don't have physical body any more and that they are what we'd consider \\"dead\\" - so when their previously deceased relatives came to assist them with the transition, they ran in the opposite direction - afraid that they are seeing the ghost.  The situation as tragic as it is, is at the same rather humorous, and the entire contents of the book are just as entertaining as informative.	2004-10-28

This is not just a theory or a philosophy - the principles, being universal, are down-to-earth practical. If you apply them consciously in your life, your life will change.<br /><br />While in times long gone by, these may have seemed to be only arbitrary spiritual principles, they are in accord with the view of quantum physics. Kybalion states that universe is mind-like in nature; quantum physics states that the universe is composed out of intelligent energy. The rest of the book describes how to manifest anything with one's thoughts - the process of manifestation, and it reminds me of the book \\"Dimensional Structure of Consciousness\\" by Samuel Avery.<br /><br />The most important part of this book - other than pointing out these principles is that they are UNIVERSAL - they allways work, they express throughout nature and if you use them and apply the consciously, you can create whatever you can possibly desire in your life. You will know then that there is a law and that it works with mathematical precision, and that you can ALWAYS count on it.<br /><br />The moment you grasp this truth, you will never ever again wish or hope for something to happen, you will know that you have the power to create it and you will be certain of it. And when you use this principles consciously and experience the truth of them - no one in the entire world will ever be able to talk you out of fulfilling your heart's desires. Even if the entire world doubts and laughs at you, you will not care because you'll KNOW that you CAN. You will have the \\"key\\".	2004-10-28

The method creates a true win-win situation and as opposite to traditional methods of depossession which sometimes have rather dismal consequences, this method is safe.<br /><br />The best part is that by the time you're done with this book, you will be enriched with greater understanding and you will have no fear of any discarnate entities.  Rather than threatening them or fearing them, you'll be educating them and helping them in making a better choice for all concerned.  You'll be sharing love and light and instead of engaging in fear and combat.<br /><br />From the experiences in my own practice, I can attest that the method works wonders.	2004-10-28

First part deals with the Origins and Sexual Philosophy of the White Tigress as well as Taoist Alchemical Correlations. The second part describes the Sexual Triad - The White Tigress, The Green Dragon and The Jade Dragon. Part three describes the Restoration (rejuvenation) Methods of the Tigress as well as The Transformation Techniques.<br /><br />Some of the exercises are practiced without the partner (such as exercises for restoring and enlarging the breasts and for slimming the waist line), while other exercises require the partner (the focus of these exercises is on oral stimulation and absorption of the male sexual energy for the purpose of rejuvenation).<br /><br />I should point out that not all of the practices are suitable for every woman, however every woman could pick out the exercises that she feels comfortable with and experience the increased vitality, youthfulness, self-confidence and intensified sexual enjoyment.<br /><br />I would also recommend the book Healing Love Through Tao: Cultivating Female Sexual Energy by Mantak and Maneewan Chia.	2004-10-28

The crystal which formed when the word \\"love\\" was written in Japanese looked so beautiful and well defined, that it almost made me begin to learn Japanese (soon, I will).  But the havoc that the statement \\"you fool\\" created - I think that all who happen to use these words frequently either when referring to themselves or others, should take a closer look to get a picture as to what it does to their bodies.<br /><br />It has been known to those who are involved in metaphysical studies that the vibration of love heals the body and that vibrations of fear, hate, lies cause the cells of the body to fall apart.  The pictures in this book demonstrate what the vibrations of different ideas, thoughts, emotions, statements and music do to water.<br /><br />This is an enlightening book which is intended to demonstrate the effect that music and words we use have on our bodies, given the fact that our bodies are mainly composed out of water.<br /><br />The current edition of the book is an expanded version of the original book which contained only pictures and was reprinted due to its great demand.<br /><br />The author did make few statements, though, which I do not consider entirely correct - one of them being that \\"ALL is made out of water\\" - I believe that, at least in view of both quantum physics and metaphysics, it would be more correct to state that - ALL is made out of intelligent energy - and that water in this case was a medium for experiments which have the workings of energy and vibration at the core.<br /><br />Having an esoteric background, when I picked up this book, I was expecting it to go a little bit further - as in consciously intending outcomes and projecting them upon the glass of water, instead of just writing the words and statement on paper.  One can, for example, also use litmus paper to measure the changes in pH levels in water after directing focused energy charged with specific thoughts, either purely mentally or through one's hands, into the glass of water.the core. <br /> <br />Having an esoteric background, when I picked up this book, I was expecting it to go a little bit further - as in consciously intending outcomes and projecting them upon the glass of water, instead of just writing the words and statement on paper.

This book is about the players on both sides - seducers and seduced.  Based on psychological preferences, the author has divided seducers and seducees into types, offering a psychological profile and the tactics for winning the game of seduction, together with providing an example of each.<br /><br />If you are ever involved in the game of seduction, just like playing any other game,it is useful knowing the rules of the game as well as knowing your own strong and weak points.<br /><br />Some people who read this book would come to the conclusion that seducers, hunters, are villains and those being seduced, hunted - victims.  That, though, is left up to another debate.<br />Those who don't care to be involved in games of seduction are not going to fall prey to the game any more, any more than those who don't want to be involved in playing a game of chess will end up playing it - and neither will those who have high moral standards engage in senselessly playing with other's minds and emotions.<br /><br />The book is an interesting read at least from the psychological perspective.

As such, it is a very interesting read.  Each \\"law of power\\" is illustrated with sample stories and some of the stories may be too much for the faint of heart - they are utterly ruthless.<br /><br />Power is so seductive - the effects of it like chasing, fighting for and owning the \\"one ring that rules them all\\" from Talkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  It seems so irresistible, so sweet, but watch out how far you go, because while setting a trap for another, you can find yourself unnoticeably getting caught in it.<br /><br />There is a saying that the absolute power corrupts.  That is not exactly true of the \\"real\\" power - but the \\"real\\" power is not based on fear, only the perceived power is based on fear and that is what Machiavellian power is based upon.  After all his motto was that it is better to be feared than to be loved.  And if you invest yourself totally in being feared, one day you just find yourself ending all alone.  There is yet another and better way - but that one takes another route.  It is based on higher knowledge.<br /><br />I am glad that Robert Green has added the \\"reversals\\" - the way you can find this double edged sword of power stuck in your own back if you're not careful.<br /><br />This book is a lovely compendium of use and abuse of power with plenty of stories drawn from history.  It is nice to be aware of possible consequences when using the laws of power before you become power crazy and find yourself in a ditch.  With great power comes great responsibility.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that there is no \\"how to\\" in this book - well, even each heading clearly points out the modus operandi, which is further illustrated through the stories.<br /><br />And not all the laws in the book are devious, even thought that may seem to be the main flavor of the book. Some of the laws are good common-sense advice as in \\"avoid free lunch\\", \\"plan all the way\\", \\"concentrate your forces\\", \\"master the art of timing\\", etc.<br /><br />As you read this book, I'll just like to mention a story of a man who felt rather shy and powerless and who figured that the best way out for him to feel like somebody would be if he gets other people to be afraid of him.  He found a book on mind-power and sat down to practice.  It didn't take long, before he was apparently wielding power and people around him felt rather anxious in his presence.  Eventually they all began finding excuses for staying away from him and in the end he was all alone - no one wanted him around.<br /><br />So, when you engage into experimenting with these laws of power, temper them with love and wisdom - else you may not be too happy with your creation.

It may help you to find and learn characters that relate to specific character easily.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book is a list of radicals.<br /><br />The main characters are listed in alphabetical order under the name of that character in English, as in \\"arros\\", \\"ghost\\", \\"legs\\", etc.<br /><br />Under the character for \\"arrow\\" are listed different chinese words that contain the character for \\"arrow\\".<br /><br />Beside each Chinese character, there is pronounciation in pinyin as well as description of the meaning in English.<br /><br />The words are listed from the smaller number of strokes toward the larger.<br /><br />The presentation of the characters in this book provides yet another tool to memorize characters in respect to relevancy and association.<br /><br />While this is considered to be a dictionary - I find it more useful just for learning different characters, rather than using the book as a dictionary. As far as dictionaries go, my all time favorite is Wenlin (electronic dictionary) since you can also hear the pronounciation.)	2004-10-27

This is not just a theory or a philosophy - the principles, being universal, are down-to-earth practical.  If you apply them consciously in your life, your life will change.<br /><br />While in times long gone by, these may have seemed to be only arbitrary spiritual principles, they are in accord with the view of quantum physics.  Kybalion states that universe is mind-like in nature; quantum physics states that the universe is composed out of intelligent energy.  The rest of the book describes how to manifest anything with one's thoughts - the process of manifestation, and it reminds me of the book \\"Dimensional Structure of Consciousness\\" by Samuel Avery.<br /><br />The most important part of this book - other than pointing out these principles is that they are UNIVERSAL - they allways work, they express throughout nature and if you use them and apply the consciously, you can create whatever you can possibly desire in your life.  You will know then that there is a law and that it works with mathematical precision, and that you can ALWAYS count on it.<br /><br />The moment you grasp this truth, you will never ever again wish or hope for something to happen, you will know that you have the power to create it and you will be certain of it.  And when you use this principles consciously and experience the truth of them - no one in the entire world will ever be able to talk you out of fulfilling your heart's desires.  Even if the entire world doubts and laughs at you, you will not care because you'll KNOW that you CAN.  You will have the \\"key\\".	2004-10-27

Victims of Brocq's disease develop a thick, horny covering over their skin that resembles the scales of a reptile. The skin can become so hardened and rigid that even the slightest movement will cause it to crack and bleed.<br /><br />Brocq's disease was incurable until 1951 when a sixteen-year-old boy with an advanced case of the affliction was referred as a last resort to a hypnotherapist named A.A. Mason at the Queen Victoria Hospital in London. Mason discovered that the boy was a good hypnotic subject and could easily be put into a deep state of trance.<br /><br />While the boy was in trance, Mason told him that his Brocq's disease was healing and would soon be gone. Five days later the scaly layer covering the boy's left arm fell off, revealing soft, healthy flesh beneath. By the end of tend days the arm was completely normal.<br /><br />Mason and the boy continued to work on different body areas until all of the scaly skin was gone. The boy remained symptom-free for at least five years, at which point Mason lost touch with him.<br /><br />This is extraordinary because Brocq's disease is a genetic condition, and getting rid of it involves more than just controlling autonomic processes such as blood flow patterns and various cells of the immune system. It means tapping into the masterplan, the DNA programming itself. So, it would appear that when we access the right strata of our beliefs, our minds can override even our genetic makeup.\\"	2004-10-27

Time Line techniques have helped me to create virtual healing miracles, by going back to the past before the problematic situation began and going through the time-line to the present and future, as if the problem never existed.  Health problems which were diagnosed as terminal and without hope for recovery - were gone in only few days of working with Time-Lines.<br /><br />It will be well-worth your time to learn how to work with time-lines whether you desire to use them for your own benefit or to assist others, if you are a therapist.<br /><br />This book will thoroughly guide you through Time Line Patterns and Processes, and many different adventures you can have with time-lines - whether you desire to resolve emotional issues from the past, accelerate learning of new skills, re-create your life (or if you prefer the programming which is impressed upon your subconscious mind / neurology), accelerate spiritual growth (I have had some out of this world spiritual experiences thanks to working with Time-Lines).<br /><br />You'll also learn how to work with logical levels, use advanced Time-Line Patterns, how to use linguistic time-lining and much more - you'll have extra fun when you learn to use time-lines through conversation.<br /><br />Get this book - you'll be grateful you did!	2004-10-27

That being said, you may or may not like what you experience using this method.  There is another fun book (perhaps my favorite on past-life regression - Mind-Probe Hypnosis by Irene Hickman - while this other book does not deal with methods you'd do on your own, it may give you a good picture on what you may expect to encounter following this particular method - a bunch of unresolved issues from the past.  While it may be useful resolving them - it may not be necessarily pleasant experience.<br /><br />You may also think of something that you have particular affinity for in this life and trace that emotion - experiencing that pleasant emotion you can trace them back to the original experience that gave rise to such emotions.  That may be a more pleasant experience.<br /><br />While the experiments I did with techniques from this book were instantly successful, I can say that the life I have right now is a much happier experience than anything I managed to dig out from the past.<br /><br />We may entertain romantic ideas about some better past, and some memories may perhaps enrich your present life, but what you are more likely to discover that life and learning moves forward and that whatever you may be experiencing in your life right now may very well be the most wonderful part of your life.<br /><br />The fact will also remain that you may not exactly be able to prove what you experience to be real.  It will feel just as real as a memory from the past, relived in the present moment, and whatever you experience in your emotions as real is bound to feel very real - but the experiences may still leave questions was that really your life or did you pick someone else's life, or just tuned into a vibration from some other time, or is what you are reliving like dreams that you dream during the night that feel real but are composite of information you have truly experienced and the mixture of information that might have come some other way.<br /><br />For that reason, the greatest benefit that I see in working with past-lives is not proving the validity of information that cannot be proven for certain, but rather in helping you to remove the obstacles from the present.  In that respect, the process may be somewhat even like working with Jungian active imagination process - if it helps you to heal wounds from the past, if it helps you to feel better, it's a valuable tool.<br /><br />While the remembered information may or may not feel completely accurate - even though it will feel as very real - and you may keep in mind the fact that even when you remember something that happened five years ago may already have been somewhat altered in your mind - what you are really working with is emotions, and one of the purposes of he process is to help you release the emotional baggage from the past.  Past life regression is not the only method, but it is one of them.<br /><br />Other purposes may be getting information for the purpose of creative enrichment.  If you're a writer, you could get great stories.  If you were an archaeologist, perhaps it could help you to dig some treasures from the past.<br /><br />You could go exploring any past talents, though I happen to believe that any talents you might have had at any point in the past, you'd still have in the present - perhaps even more developed - but that's for you to discover.<br /><br />Some of the techniques in this book involve dreaming, hypnotic regression (one could say though that all regression involves hypnosis), scrying, dowsing, feeling (in hypnosis this is called using the \\"affect brdige\\"), etc.<br /><br />In any event, if you want to have fun exploring past-lives on your own - this is the book to get.s this is called using the \\"affect brdige\\"), etc.<br /><br />In any event, if you want to have fun exploring past-lives on your own - this is the book to get.	2004-10-27

By the time you get addicted to writing Chinese characters, you may also want to get NJStar program).<br /><br />A good way to continue with reading and writing for serious students may be getting into the New Practical Chinese Reader (make sure you also get the tapes with the program).<br /><br />Understanding Chinese movies may still be a rather challenging proposition, so as the next step you could get Rosetta Stone's Mandarin Chinese.	2004-10-27

One reason that I particularly liked this program is because of its substitution exercises.<br /><br />I did find it in the past easier to learn foreign languages using an assortment of different sources and reading as many different books in a new language as I can.  This not only provides an additional variety, but you get to encounter the words and phrases in many different contexts.<br /><br />I do like the fact that speakers from different countries are used on these recordings.  It helps to develop flexibility.  For that matter I like to listen also to the speakers from Spain to get used to different pronounciations.	2004-10-27

One advantage of Wenlin is that you can hear the words, phrases and entire sentences pronounced. You can also enter text in pinyin, in Chinese characters, or in English. It is very useful when you desire to translate the information you found on the Internet because you can just copy and paste the Chinese text, and while this program is not considered to be a translator - it will help you a great deal in that respect, too.<br /><br />Other than that it will give you an assortment of lists related to the character or word - according to the frequency, stroke count, radicals and much more.

This book should definitely be on your reading list, and you may want to read it several times.<br /><br />Here's one more story from this books:<br /><br />Several years ago while doing research on hypnosis, a professor of psychology induced a somnambulistic trance in a subject.  The subject was capable of the most profound hypnotic phenomenon, including post-hypnotic amnesia.  The thrust of this research was to test the theory that upon carrying out post hypnotic suggestion, the subject would re-enter the hypnotic state.<br /><br />While in this somnambulistic state, the subject was told that when a clock chimed 10:00 p.m. at that evening's faculty party, she would remove one of her shoes; place it on the dining room table and put roses into the shoe.  Further, it was suggested that she would have no memory of the suggestion; it would appear to be her own idea, and she would fee compelled to finish her task.<br /><br />A very interesting thing happened on the way to the forum.  While she was carrying out the hypnotic suggestion, the professor asked her what she was doing.  She replied that her husband had given her a beautiful crystal vase that looked just like her shoe and she had never known what to do with it.  She went on to state that it had suddenly dawned on her how to arrange flowers in the vase and she had to try it in her shoe before she forgot.<br /><br />While her explanation appears absurd, she acted as if she believed she was telling the truth.  As the professor tried to explain to her how ridiculous her story was, she became anxious, agitated and very defensive.  The experiment was terminated due to her extreme discomfort.	2004-10-27

One of the reasons I was postponing reading this book is that I generally don't rush to buy \\"channelled\\" books - there are very few of those that I really like and this one is one of them.<br /><br />It's a good book from from the perspective of psychology,  metaphysics, and hypnosis - and even if you are well-versed in these areas and you know them inside out, you can still benefit from reading this book.<br /><br />The book deals in great depth with beliefs.  As a hypnotherapist and metaphysician, I am extremely well-aware of the role they play in creating one's experience of reality and it is amazing that there are no hypnosis books that have dealth so thoroughly and insightfully with beliefs (nope, not even Dilts' book on Beliefs).<br /><br />Now that I've read this book - I think it should be a required reading for all hypnotherapists.	2004-10-24

You can learn slang from the movies, too, but having a book which some common expressions spelled out may help you, too.  It will also help you if you're socializing with Italian crowd in your neighborhood.  It will spice up your interaction and you can enjoy the pleasure of understanding what they're talking about when they use slang.<br /><br />The previous reviewer pointed out that Italian language has been standardized - all that this means is that everyone is learning in school the same Italian.  People from different regions at home may still use the dialect from their own region, so for example, a Calabrese will speak the standardized Italian, but he may also use Calabrese dialect.	2004-10-24

Books	2	7	8	N	N	Much left to be desired	I really, really love Ormond McGill and his books, but this book won't take you anywhere fast.  It leaves much to be desired.  Instead of this book, I'd recommend his \\"Hypnotism and Mysticism in India\\" - it is chockfull of good techniques.<br /><br />The only thing that this particular book does is attempts to point to differences between hypnosis and meditation - there is such a thin line dividing these two areas, and what is generally referred to as meditation is just stilling your mind and listening to inner guidance, tuning into and aligning with Divine (the part where God / Your Deeper Wisdom talks to you), whereas what is generally labeled hypnosis is you programming your subconscious with desired outcomes (the part where you talk to God).  In both instances you are technically in altered state, in trance, in hypnotic state - at least as far as your brainwaves are concerned - you drift from beta, to alpha, to theta, etc. - even if some people would say that the ultimate purpose of meditation is to become de-hypnotised - from your limitations, that is.	2004-10-24

Remember Nancy School and Dr. Liebeault from your studies in history of hypnosis? Well, Ormond McGill has brought them back to life, so you'll get a little bit more insight in interesting experiments they used to do while hypnosis still used techniques of mesmerism.  And I'm really glad for all the effort McGill invested in bringing back some valuable information that can enrich \\"modern\\" hypnotists - bringing life and energy to the world of hypnosis, because some intellectually oriented minds have completely dropped the energy out of equasion due to their own lack of understanding.<br /><br />Now, awareness of using one's mind to work with energy is happily emerging in the west and one may even thank the proliferation of Eastern techniques and methods (from India and China - mainly in the area of healing - sure, you've heard of \\"chi kung\\").  In the west, these techings were mainly wrapped in mysteries reserved only for those who had inclination for esoteric studies and different occult practices.<br /><br />There are two other books I recommend as a supplementary reading and workbooks together with this one - They are Ormond McGill's \\"Hypnotism and Mysticism in India\\" and Franz Bardon's \\"Initiation into Hermetics\\". They will help you to better develop the skills and use techniques from this book.<br /><br />After describing different experiments performed a century or two ago (for that matter, you can find many other more modern books with numerous other mind-over-matter experiments), Ormond guides you through some practical techniques so that you can conduct your own experiments with these techniques.<br /><br />The book is directed to those who have interest in using them in stage shows and from that perspective, stage mentalists who only learn how to use \\"tricks\\" to make the audience believe they can do something they are not doing, can benefit from learning how to be able to do genuine mentalism instead of faking in and using the art of deception.  On this account there are some authors who are entirely focused on the area of deception and because that is all that they know and all that they are aware of, they live convinced that everything that comes even close to it must be some kind of deception.  But where here is smoke, you can rest assured that there is fire, too.  And even though they are ignorant of the fire and of the way how to produce real effects, it doesn't mean that the real thing cannot be done.  In that respect, I do recommend this book to all those \\"stage mentalists\\" who have so far acquainted themselves only with techniques for producing different mind effects through trickery.  They may surprise themselves with what they will be able to accomplish.<br /><br />This book will also benefit a regular hypnotherapist who has no intention to get involved with any stage performance. They will learn how to add more power to their hypnotic techniques, by using the power of their minds, by working with the energy and direct thought transference, instead of just using words. They may also become aware of the fact that their own beliefs and expectations, even though unvoiced do affect the outcomes they get with their clients because there is always silent communication going on mental level and it goes beyond the subtle cues of body language (minimal cues, as they are called in NLP).<br /><br />The book is called Mindreading, but the techniques covered are also used in what we call \\"remote hypnosis\\" or \\"remote influence\\".  It doesn't matter whether the person is sitting next to you, or is in another room, or even in another country - when you work with mind and energy.<br /><br />A distinction is made in the book between contact and non-contact mind-reading.  Contact mind-reading was also used by Dr. Milton Erickson.  Here practice with some essential NLP skills may be helpful as in order to be good with this, you'll haveto be aware of the subtle (minimal cues) given off by another person.  It is somewhat like a \\"lie detector\\", except that instead of a machine, you are using your own observational (calibration) skills to notice the subtle physiological differences in another person - in this case through touch.<br /><br />Non-contact mind-reading involves clearing your mind and receiving mental impressions - something alike doing remote viewing, though there are remote viewing techniques that may go a little bit further than this.<br /><br />For those interested in incorporating mindreading techniques from this book in their stage show, Ormond McGill provides several different routines to spice up the show., you'll have to be aware of the subtle (minimal cues) given off by another person.

So for a person with an average hypnosis training, the techniques in this book are bound to take his hypnosis practice to the next level.<br /><br />This is a very small book - only about 100 pages and the first half of the book takes you through some very basic and essential NLP skills such as calibration, eye-accessing cues, verbal predicates, establishing rapport, Milton Model, and at the end of the book, you'll find a list of hypnotic language patterns.  I still believe that any professional hypnotist should take NLP training.<br /><br />The next section of the book has an overview of different suggestibility tests, inductions and deepeners both from traditional hypnosis, from Ericksonian hypnosis and from Ormond McGill.<br /><br />I'd like to add few words about Ormond McGill, since he seems to be the only well-known hypnotist in the west who has incorporated what are otherwise known as esoteric techniques in his practice of hypnosis.<br /><br />You'll find a lot of books on hypnosis that deal just with traditional hypnosis, NLP and Ericksonian hypnosis.<br /><br />Traditional hypnosis had a path similar to the way that chemistry emerged from alchemy:  people kept the mechanical techniques, but left the spirit (life-force) out of it.  You still get the results, but there's always something missing there - like a physical body without life in it. That was also the path of modern medicine.<br /><br />Mesmer was on the right track.  He recognized that there is something intangible (life-force / energy) involved in the process - he called in animal magnetism.  Benjamin Franklin laughed him away - saying no, no, it's imagination that does the trick.  Yet both were right.  It is imagination that stirs the energy, the life-force and creates changes.  Traditional hypnosis dropped the \\"working with the energy\\" bit, and kept for the most part just the mechanical techniques and went on toward the development and use of hypnotic language (as in Ericksonian hypnosis).<br /><br />In Eastern countries, where this invisible energy is accounted, there are numerous practices for learning how to use mind-power to play with this energy and get some extraordinary results.  Ormond McGill published one lovely book \\"Hypnotism and Mysticism in India\\" which contains some good exercises.  In essence they are very similar to the mind-training exercises described in the book \\"Initiation into Hermetics\\" by Franz Bardon.<br /><br />If you understand the role that \\"energy / life-force\\" plays, and you learn to use your own mind-power to manipulate it, you'll get much, much farther with hypnosis.  Hypnotic techniques and hypnotic language, together with essential NLP skills will give you \\"external skills\\" of hypnosis, working with the energy will give you \\"internal skills\\" (I like to refer to them as \\"internal martial arts\\" - after all, that's what Oriental \\"nei kung\\" practices are all about).<br /><br />This book \\"The Deep Trance Training Manual\\" deals for the most part with \\"external skills\\", but there is a brief mention of some methods used by Ormond McGill, and I am very glad that Igor mentioned them. But, there is much, much more to this.<br /><br />Still, if there were only one practical book on hypnosis that you were buying, I'd recommend you get this one.  It has no fluff, only one technique after another.  If you put to practice everything you learn in this book, you will be way ahead of any average hypnotist.something intangible (life-force / energy) involved in the process - he called in animal magnetism.

Sometimes his additions to the noble Gallic tongue were even more attrocious than his accent.<br /><br />During some delicate negotions at Casablanca, the stubborn Charles de Gaulle denounced an Allied plan to fuse him and his rival, French general Henri Giraud.  Churchill, glaring at the Gaulle, delivered this concoction: \\"Si vous m'obstaclerez, je vous liquiderai!\\" (If you obstacle me, I will liquidate you!) A bewildered de Gaulle backed off.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />In 1900, the twenty-six-year-old Churchill, after just being elected to Parliament, made a speaking tour of America.

When you are congruenty focused upon your outcome, when you are determined to have it more than anything else in the entire world, you can have that outcome and there is no power in the world that will be able to stop you.<br /><br />The book uses the metaphor from the Gandalf's Battle on the Bridge in the Mines of Moria, but it has also reminded me of the movie John Q. and it has reminded me of instances in my own life when I was determined to have specific outcome and it didn't matter if I live or die in the process, because the only thing that mattered was the specific outcome.<br /><br />Based on those experiences I totally resonated with and appreciated the point that Ramtha made in this book - when you are possessed of this will, even if you lost your body in the process, you'd still go for that outcome that is so important to you and you would be unstoppable.  And it is true, to the onlookers you may looked like a possessed, frightening individual because you have no fear and nothing else exists for you other than that single thing upon which the entire energy of your being is totally focused to the point that you have become your outcome.	2004-10-16

As the other reviewer pointed - it would come across as \\"psychobabble\\".  It's pretty much like describing how the ice-cream tastes to someone who has never tasted an ice-cream.  It would be entirely meaningless.<br /><br />It was amusing to me over the years as I shared the book \\"Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East\\" - and some got inspired, some got nothing out of it, and some used the information and knowledge for purposes that never entered my mind at a time.  One person with whom I shared those books, used the knowledge to win the lottery.<br /><br />Many years before I came across this book \\"Parallel Lifetimes\\", I too, used this process of \\"shifting into another lifetime\\" to get myself into the right state of mind to win at the games of chance.  It worked.<br /><br />This may make far more sense to people who are familiar with Time-Lines (a technique from Neuro-Linguistic Programming), which I have used on numerous occasions to get extraordinary results - even for the purpose of instant healing of conditions that were considered incurable.<br /><br />If you are familiar with hypnosis, working with mind-power, you'll know that the essence of hypnosis lies in playing well the game of \\"pretending\\".  In this process of \\"pretending\\" you subjectively shift into another reality - where that which you desire to experience is \\"real\\" for you now.  For your subconscious mind the difference between \\"real\\" and \\"imaginary\\" is not based on what is \\"inside of you\\" or \\"outsie of you\\", but what FEELS SUBJECTIVELY REAL to you.  Whatever \\"feels\\" real for you becomes actualized in your outer experience - the \\"outer\\" being only an \\"effect\\" of the inner.<br /><br />This is practically the opposite view of commonly accepted worldview, but to the one who chooses to simply pay attention to his thoughts and to his experiences in the outer world, this becomes soon very obvious.  There are those who are just philosophers and those who choose to engage in personal experiments and learn how they can intentionally use the power of their minds to create what they desire.<br /><br />There is a practical purpose in experimenting with shifting consciously into what may be called a parallel lifetime (that, again is the essence of working with NLP technique of working with Time-Lines) - it helps to engage in the game of \\"pretending\\" easier by dropping all the limitations in one shot, or at least as many limitations as are obstructing the achievement of the outcome that are important to the individual to experience - an example of that may be healing a terminal illness.<br /><br />Ramtha's books from the Fireside Collection, do not guide you through any specific techniques, so if you're looking for \\"how to\\" books, you may be disappointed.  If you're looking for \\"how to\\" book, you may get much more out of books such as \\"Adventures with Time-Lines\\".  Ramtha's books are also not pointing out any \\"new truths\\" - just the same spiritual truths that have been around for thousands of years, in a new light, using a little bit different language.<br /><br />Quantum physics is now considered \\"scientific\\", while spiritual and metaphysical truths were not considered \\"scientific\\" and some people find this different language and explanations more helpful.  On the other hand, no matter what language is used, the only way anyone will ever get any practical benefit from any of the teachings and ideas is through personal application and experimentation.  There is no way one is ever going to truly know something without experiencing it.<br /><br />Sometimes people enjoy cultivating an idea that once they apply some ideas they will overnight become something entirely different or that perhaps working with parallel lifetimes, they'll wake up tomorrow and find themselves living on another planet, in another century, being someone else or something to that effect.  What will more likely happen is that as you shift into another state of consciousness, as your perception of the world changes (and that can change overnight), your experience of the world will change.  And in that respect, you may also pick A Course in Miracles and if you wholeheartedly work with it for one year, your experience of reality will turn upside down.<br /><br />The essence of this little book is that with each shift in consciousness you make, you are embarking upon and traveling upon a new time-line.  Each time you make a decision which way to go, you are choosing a destination, a path, and each path, each choice, constitutes one possible lifetime.and find themselves living on another planet, in another century, being someone else or something to that effect.

The topic of this book deals with the importance of living in the now and the fact that one won't be going spiritually anywhere fast without willingness to let go of the past and be fully present in the moment.<br /><br />The book deals with some truths that are presented at much greater length in A Course in Miracles - as the entire training manual from A Course in Miracles guides the person through the process of realizing that his mind is preoccupied with past thoughts, helping the person to let go of them and live fully in the present.<br /><br />Holding onto the past, emotionally, keeps the individual's energy locked in the past and prevents the individual from accomplishing effortlessly many wonderful things which the individual could accomplish in the present moment.<br /><br />A simple act of forgiveness and just letting go of whatever has happened in the past has helped numerous individuals experience instant healings.<br /><br />Any conflict that anyone can ever experience is based upon dragging something from the past into the present moment - upon<br /><br />comparing and judging, instead of just being fully present in the moment.<br /><br />By living in the present one moves into a timeless zone - his entire energy available to flow freely to create desired reality now, without any obstructions - affording the individual to experience in the outer world even instant manifestations.  One moment you think a thought, the next moment it is manifested in your outer experience.<br /><br />That's why some people, like Jung, would say that you know you are moving forward along your spiritual path when you are experiencing increased number of synchronicities.  Synchronicities are simply instant manifestation of one's thoughts which are possible because the individual has become a \\"clear\\" channel and is free of any obstructions and encumbrances from the past.<br /><br />There is yet another wonderful side-effect of being fully present in the moment - as anyone who has wholeheartedly worked with A Course in Miracles can attest to - you begin to feel more vibrantly alive than you ever felt before, you also begin to experience boundless joy, happiness and power.>There is yet another wonderful side-effect of being fully present in the moment - as anyone who has wholeheartedly worked with A Course in Miracles can attest to - you begin to feel more vibrantly alive than you ever felt before, you also begin to experience boundless joy, happiness and power. <br />	2004-10-16

You'd be better off looking into \\"how to\\" books from eastern esoteric tradition (Taoist Inner Alchemy, nei kung) or from western esoteric tradition (even a book \\"Initiation into Hermetics\\").<br /><br />If you don't have any esoteric understanding, the Buddha's Neuronet for Levitation, may not be helpful to you at all - the words in it will go over your head, so to speak.<br /><br />On the other hand, yes, the book does accurately describe how consciousness affects the energy field which then creates changes in one's neurology.<br /><br />Now, it doesn't matter if you are using the language from western spiritual traditions, or language from oriental traditions (together with complex techniques), or the language of quantum physics - before you'd get anywhere with levitation, you'd have to embrace the worldview in which everything is made out of energy/spirit, the worldview in which your body is made out of this same energy and where your thoughts direct and manipulate this energy.  It is simply just a shift in consciousness, but in this shift, in this worldview - your body is in your mind (as opposite to the common western worldview where your mind is in your body and which will get you absolutely nowhere if you desire to experiment with levitation).<br /><br />To create this shift in consciousness, you can sit down every day and begin with imagining and feeling yourself embracing, and being the allness of the universe, stretching across time and space.  Thoughts and emotions create a vibration.  And this simple little meditation will help you to change the vibration of your body.  Simply put while you are holding in your mind thoughts of the physical world, your are lowering the vibration of your body (your body also being energy - and if you need help with this concept, you may also pick a little book on quantum physics \\"dimensional structure of consciousness\\"), when you are holding in your mind thoughts of all (of all being spiritual or mind-like in nature), you are raising the vibration of your body, creating a gravitational pull upward - leaving the gravitational field of the earth.<br /><br />The above is not exactly explained in that way in this book (the book uses more complex language), but there is one simple truth in there - that the higher vibration \\"consumes\\", \\"eats up\\", lower vibration.<br /><br />To provide some examples which may seem to be more down-to-earth or closer to something you can experiment it and get instant results even now is - working with the vibration of love.<br /><br />Love is the highest feeling vibration, light is the highest visible vibration and either one will do for your experiments.<br /><br />If you have any inharmonious condition in your life and you imagine directing love or light to it, so that that condition (or perhaps a person who is giving you a hard time, or if you have an ailment in your body, then your body) is entirely saturated with love and light - you'd in effect raise the vibration of the particular condition and there would be no more problem.<br /><br />You may be familiar with the records from the lives of different \\"saints\\", who at the time of rapture, in moments of utter devotion, found themselves lifted off the ground.  Whatever you \\"love\\" you become it \\"vibrationally\\".  Love is that which creates gravitational pull on your body - upward or downward.  When you love something with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, you direct your entire energy toward it, your energy field changes and you become it.  Holding in your mind and heart the infinite is one way of creating a gravitational pull upward. As a matter of fact if you were to spend even half-an-hour a day loving the All, with every last bit your energy, with all your mind, heart, soul and strength, sending this love out through every cell and atom of your being- you'd instantly feel the changes taking place in the cells of your physical body, because the intensity of your emotion would change your energy field which would in tern have an effect upon your physical body.<br /><br />If you are looking for more complicated ways, you can pick books that deal with nei kung and teach you numerous practices that will help you to learn how to manipulate the energy.<br /><br />You may also pick \\"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\\".  The method is simple and straightforward, but again, until you get it, unless you are familiar with the terminology, it may seem more complicated than it is.  The essence of accomplishing any ability is this:  what you focus upon to the exclusion of everything else - you become.  You just have to stick with it, or rather learn how to create one-pointed focus and be able to maintain it long enough to get the desired results.<br /><br />Going from one book to another, looking for a \\"quick fix\\", may provide some intellectual satisfaction, but there's no way around sitting down and working on the change in your consciousness - whatever method you choose to experiment with.<br /><br />You'll also get much further and much faster if you begin your experiments in manipulating the energy with goals that take much less time to get the results.  Each success you achieve using your mind-power to create desired outcomes in your life, will condition your subconscious with more and more success and you'll be moving forward at a steady pace.m of your being - you'd instantly feel the changes taking place in the cells of your physical body, because the intensity of your emotion would change your energy field which would in tern have an effect upon your physical body. <br /> <br />If you are looking for more complicated ways, you can pick books that deal with nei kung and teach you numerous practices that will help you to learn how to manipulate the energy. <br /> <br />You may also pick \\"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\\".

I have found her books &quot;Mind Probe Hypnosis&quot; and &quot;Remote Depossession&quot; a true delight to read. They are both informative and entertaining.<br /><br /> In &quot;Remote Depossession&quot;, Irene Hickman describes a process which is a derivation of, and similar to the process described in the book that perhaps inspired the entire development of Spirit Releasement process, in a compassionate way (as opposite to &quot;exorcism&quot;) - &quot;30 Years Among the Dead&quot;.<br /><br /> The process described in this book involves the use of another person, who through guided hypnosis session, sends a fragment of his consciousness into a person who may be influenced by other human or non-human entities.<br /><br /> The process does involve asking the Higher Self, Higher Wisdom of the possibly possessed individual for permission to scan the individual and proceed with help, which is about 99% of the time granted, but in few instances may be rejected because the individual needs to undergo some other learnings.<br /><br /> In my opinion, whether we get permission to do anything specific to help the person who may be suffering or not, we can always send love and light to everyone. After all, what we wish and send to others, in due time, returns to us.<br /><br /> There is a brief mention of other therapists who have adapted remote depossession technique and who conduct the entire process mentally, without the assistance of an additional person.	2004-08-01

The reader who was disappointed and gave this book &quot;1 star&quot; must have missed the point and the purpose of this book. The books is about Spirit Releasement and it contains an abundance of real-life stories, which make it for an enjoyable and easy reading.<br /><br /> The author doesn't state that all problems in anyone's life are related to spirit releasement, however she does tactfully and routinelly check for the possibility of any mental and energetic influences from external sources. It simply makes it easier when assisting the client to deal with issue that actually relate to the client.<br /><br /> It is not the purpose of spirit releasement techniques to place all the blame and responsibility on outer sources. After all, it is the individual's own thoughts and emotions that open the person to any external influences. And even when spirit releasement does indeed provide speedy relief from some perplexing problems, unless the individual invests some conscious effort in maintaining healthy state of mind, emotions and body, he may very well open himself to more unhealthy influences.<br /><br /> The thing that I particularly like about spirit releasement books as opposite to exorcism books is that the therapist doesn't just remove the unhealthy influence, but makes sure to help it to understand and exprience that there is a better way to live and that it is in its best interests.<br /><br /> I like Irene Hickman's metaphor (from her book &quot;Remote Depossession&quot;) that compares the exorcism method to taking nails out of one's tire and then tossing them out on the road, so they can pierce someone else's tires, or even one's own should the individual drive along the same road at a later time; whereas she compares spirit releasement method to actually disposing of the nails so that they don't cause damage to anyone later on.<br /><br /> I have particularly appreciated the compassionate approach in this book of providing a brief therapy even to disembodied spirits before directing them into the light.<br /><br /> The book lists and provides examples of extremely wide range of external influences - the greatest number of external influences being by lost and confused human beings who have not successfully made a transition to the spirit world.<br /><br /> The influences are not always by those we'd consider &quot;dead&quot;, but also by mental influences from other living human beings. Again, I find it important to add that nothing and noone can influence the person, unless the person has first created some kind of an opening to be influenced.

One may add that the general world-view there (at least in China) is more supportive of the practices and life-style required for spiritual attainments.<br />In Taoist Alchemy, there is even classification of immortals, according to the levels of attainment:<br />- Human Immortals remain human, but though they eat, drink and dress like people, they can avoid the calamities of aging, sickness and death<br />- Earth Immortals remain on the earth, but they are not affected by cold or heat, hunger or thirst.  Though they cannot project their spirits, they can avoid the bother of food, clothing and shelter<br />- Spiritual Immortals are capable of supernatural powers and transformations; coming and going at will; they can shed the physical shell to attain an ethereal independence.  They can dissolve into energy or solidify into form.<br />- Celestial Immortals go even further in their work.  They go beyond our human world to another world that cannot be imagined by human intellect.<br />Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East describes lives and provides teachings from what would in Taoist Alchemy be called Spiritual and Celestial Immortals.<br />Supernatural powers emerge spontaneously at certain stages of spiritual development, as a result of one's merging with the &quot;All&quot;, with the Infinite, with God, with Tao.<br />Any person who has even meditated for any extended period of time would of necessity become aware of the spontaneous emergence of certain &quot;powers&quot;.<br />It is only natural that as one meditates upon the Infinite Life, as one holds in his awareness the Infinite Life, that one becomes filled with more Life.<br />It is only natural that as one hold in his awareness that which is Infinite and Eternal, free of all limitations that the limitations would begin to fall off out of his own life.<br />It is only natural that as ones consciousness is filled with spiritual thoughts, spiritual energy begins to saturate his mind, emotions and body, spiritualizing the body in the process, re-arranging one's neurology and enabling the individual to do easily what he wasn't able to do before.<br />There is nothing unspiritual about using one's legs to walk, why would it be unspiritual using one's higher ability to teleport.<br />When ordinary people work at jobs using their intellectual abilities, it is no more or less spiritual then doing physical labor.  So why would manifesting supply directly of the universal substance be unspiritual?  Energy follows thought.  All that these masters are doing is using their thoughts in a constructive way.<br />After all, the life on spiritual path becomes easier and lighter, as one progresses along.<br />People in Life and Teachings do not use their powers to boost their egos, but when the use of these abilities is necessary. They use their powers responsibly.<br />Ordinary people go to schools and universities to learn some skills and get degrees.  That in itself doesn't make them either spiritual or non-spiritual.  How they use their skills - to help people or to take advantage of them, their motivations for using them is what would make it spiritual or non-spiritual.<br />We all have the same amount of time and energy available and we choose how we're going to use them, whether we'll just waste our lives, whether we'll develop skills to just get by or whether we'll develop skills and abilities that will enable us to live meaningful lives.<br />Spirituality is not something we do in our spare moments - it is the cultivation of spiritual awareness in all that we think and say and do.  And yes, bodies are necessary - that's why we're here and that's why we have them.  Our bodies are our alchemical labs, the vessels in which the alchemical transmutation occurs.  That is where we cultivate life, where we tend our spiritual embryo, until it is strong enough that the physical body is not necessary any more.  As the spiritual embryo grows and matures, the spiritual powers naturally emerge - just like a kid or a man is able to do more than a baby.  And there is nothing &quot;unspiritual&quot; about a man using the abilities that naturally emerged with his bigger and stronger body.  It is not more spiritual to keep on crawling like a baby, when one can walk, so why should one live bound by limitations of those in &quot;mortal consciousness&quot; after he realizes that he is not a &quot;mortal&quot; and &quot;limited&quot; being, after he is realizes that he is still as God created him, in His image and likeness - free of all limitations.life, where we tend our spiritual embryo, until it is strong enough that the physical body is not necessary any more.

I have to admit that I don't even care about the origin of the practice, about the lineage, titles or whatever - I'm only interested if when I applied a teaching and practice in my life - do I get the desired results - and I guarantee if you apply the information from this book, if you engage in the practices described, you will notice wonderful results - in terms of increased sexual magnetism, increased energy for healing, rejuvenation and spiritual growth (yes, yes, yes - you may even get rid of some wrinkles), and of course, more fabulous sex.<br />I have attended a workshop with Mantak Chia way back in 1987 and while I had this book, I have recently also purchased the set of videos.  I find all of them valuable - workshop,  because it gave us all opportunity to clarify anything we might have needed to clarify about the practice; book, because it went into greater lenghts in explaining finer points; and video set, because it's easy to follow and it's great to refresh some points one might have forgotten (after all, there is only so much one can remember after attending a two-day workshop and there's only so long that one can retain the information).<br />I was passionate about my practice after attending the workshop - however my practice consisted mainly from solitary practice dealing with generation and circulation of sexual energy - which I at time practiced even for 7 hours a day, during the first six months (later on, I have reduced the amount of practice) - however, certain benefits of my initial intense practice remained and have tremendously benefited me with other energy and spiritual practice I was (and still am) engaged in.<br />I feel deeply grateful for this book and for the teachings Mantak Chia brought to the west.	2004-01-02

I particularly appreciate that after each chapter there is an explanation of appropriate exercises for practice.<br />As I was reading this book, the sexual exercises in this book have very much reminded me of the Taoist Practices which I have been doing for years and those who are interested in more in-depth explanation than could fit into this book, may be interested to check out books (Healing Love Through Tao: Cultivating Female Sexual Energy and Taoist Secrets of Love: Cultivating Male Sexual Energy) and videos (Healing Love: Taoist Sexual Energy Cultivation) by Mantak Chia.	2004-01-02

One can put only so much information on one CD and for what you can learn and experience as a newcomer to Shamanic journeying in a little bit more than ONE HOUR, I have found this CD awesome.<br />I particularly liked suggestions relating how to ask good questions and set an intent for a journey.  One particular suggestion would apply to any form of divination.<br />For example, if you ask your spirit helper (power animal, etc.) &quot;Should I marry so and so?&quot;, the spirit helper may say &quot;Sure, go ahead&quot;.  Then when you get married to that person, you find out that the marriage was a complete disaster and start to wonder about the effectiveness of Shamanic journeying.<br />Sandra points out that spirit helpers view everything as a &quot;learning experience&quot;, so the most appropriate question would be &quot;What will I learn if I marry so and so?&quot;  The answer may be &quot;betrayal&quot; and you may decide that you don't really care much to learn about betrayal, to which your spirit helper answers, &quot;OK, then, don't marry that person&quot;.<br />The quality of the questions we ask greatly influences the quality of helpful information we get.<br />This CD has contains about one hour of information consisting of introduction to shamanic journeying and a lot of good key points for successful journeying and then about 10 minutes or drumming and rattling for the actual journeying experience.  I think it is a wonderful gift for someone who wants to get a taste of shamanic journeying.	2004-01-01
