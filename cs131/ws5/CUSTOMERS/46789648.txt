In this clever novel, William Brandt takes us on a behind-the-scenes tour of the filmmaking industry; anyone who has worked in the Hollywood movie mill will certainly recognize the vanities and eccentricities of their colleagues.  (This book contains an especially interesting contemporary reference to the documentary \\"Inside Deep Throat.\\")                                                                                                                                                                                                          Brandt speaks to us through Frederick Case, an immensely flawed yet likeable middle-aged film producer pining for his ex-wife Sophie.  Freddy plans, sometimes desperately, to win Sophie back but the influence of an unlikely ally, and a surprise pregnancy complicate his plans ... <br /> <br />If you find yourself rooting for Freddy, and I think you will, you  should also read How I Became Stupid by Martin Page.

In fact, her stories don't even come close to fulfilling the criteria you expect from a short story.  At first, she seems to be mocking her own inability to write a story.  As I read through the second and third story in this collection, it became more and more apparent that this was not a gimmick -- she really can't write!  Rambling does not equal writing.  There are so many wonderful collections of short stories out there I would not spend time on the unsatisfying jumble of Eldridge's \\"Unkempt.\\"	2005-01-14

The protagonist Dr. Grant blunders about in a plotline that is so weak that Huyler fails to deliver a conclusion.  This book goes absolutely nowhere, and I regret the time I invested in reading it through to the end.  The blurbs promise a medical thriller like The Hot Zone or Darwin's Radio, but Huyler's novel is a paltry wanna-be.  A doctor who writes a book can throw in a lot of medical jargon, but what he needs is a solid plot -- not one based on \\"invisible things!\\"	2004-12-28

A man and a woman meet in a hotel for their first liaison, but the passion the propels the story is his, and hers, not theirs.  Caught in an emotional tangle of love, hate and grief, the Widow pursues this man on the anniversary of her late husband's death.  The adulterous man succombs to a sexual longing for this woman so different than his own wife.  We are privvy to their thoughts in alternating chapters.  His anticipation of an erotic encounter is immediately revealed; the Widow's expectations unravel more slowly. The union of two people with separate agendas is, inevitably, skewed and as their weekend progresses, their relationship becomes increasingly raw and disturbing.  Tristram's skill in crafting this book is the way she is able to manipulate these two characters to depict the vulnerability, the pain and the confusion experienced by all victims.	2004-12-07

Yes, it helps to know vampire lore but it's not necessary. Stripping away the fangs, we're left with a tender father/daughter story, wrapped in modern day values.  As most adults discover, children fill your life in unexpected, amazing and meaningful ways.  In Vamped, this experience is large enough to fill an eternity.    Vamped is, indeed, a heartwarming story.   Even as a veteran vampire, Martin Kowalski is not immune to the charms of mortals.  Isuzu Trooper, the young girl he adopts, is irresistibly cute and quirky. The idea that Marty might harm Isuzu quickly dissipates; his desire to pierce her jugular is replaced with an overwhelming need to protect her. Martin's strategy to let his daughter win at Slapjack is endearing, and as they bond over cards we can appreciate the gravitas of her giggles.  In a unique and joyful ice-skating escapade, father and daughter both land on their butts.  In fact, their growing affection for each other seems to echo Marty's own loving relationship with his parents; even as he infuses magic into the infamous Pit Story, Marty creates a bedtime tale for Isuzu that resonates with the tremendous love he has for his own, deceased, father.       As a loving and tolerant dad himself, Martin Kowalski is so tremendously corny that some of the puns may indeed make you groan, and occasionally it seems the story is a means to a punchline.   Even with his lover, Rose, Marty is is quite the card but you can't help smiling at his constant stream of ironic commentary -- one good example is Marty's riff on vampire couples using Microsoft's WinKid to create low-maintenance offspring.  Marty's postprandial buddy, Father Jack, also has a wicked sense of humor.  Introducing Marty to his dog Judas, Father Jack explains, \\"What else would you name a son of a [...]?\\"  Bobby and Twit, Vamped's other minor characters, don't offer much in the way of humor, though they do offer a glimpse into the darker tastes of vampires.  The tone of the story changes when Bobby and Twit interact with Isuzu; ambiguity blossoms fully in the conclusion.  After all, what does \\"happily ever after\\" mean for vampires?!	2004-12-04

As a first-time novelist, Ms. Skyler certainly needed an editor yet this book seems to be woefully lacking an expert touch.  How else to explain a story that only weakly links several, smaller stories? Yes, all the characters belong to the same family but Skyler fails to plumb below that surface to reveal meaningful resonance.  The fact that both Helen and her mom are embarking on new sexual relationships could be very interesting, but Skyler does not allow the mother/daughter relationship to explore this similarity.<br /><br />Throughout \\"The Perfect Age,\\" there are plot lines that appear and disappear randomly.  We are first brought into a storyline suggesting that Helen's Dad is contemplating an extramarital affair, but his potential affair fizzles when Helen's mother gets the idea herself.  As the book progresses, we leap from summer to summer; as we enter summer three Helen blandly observes that her mother's affair with her boss probably \\"did not continue through the school year, but when summer began, the little signs started to emerge once more.\\"  In between the second and last summer, however, Helen's co-lifeguard Ernestine is transformed from a virgin to a mother-to-be.  Odder still, her mom now works with Helen's Dad, and feels comfortable enough asking him to ask Helen to speak to her daughter about giving up the baby?!?!  Clearly, Helen and her mom are forced to confront the possibility of being pregnant, but in addition to the pregnant Ernestine, Skyler crowds the story with a broken condom, a missed period and not one, but TWO ornamental eggs.<br /><br />The number of contrived intersections within the story's plotlines also make the author seem unsure of her abililty to communicate the story's message through her characters. The main story line, between Helen and Leo, is erratic and unconvincing.  He loves her; she loves him; he doesn't love her; she doesn't love him.  Perhaps Skyler was trying to embrace the ephemeral nature of young love, but her writing is just not compelling. Towards the end of the novel, Helen's younger sister is spotted in another neighborhood; eventually this mystery is revealed -- but not at all logically explained -- when Jenny confesses she was hired by another lifeguard to read to his sick mom.  Perhaps Skyler is trying so hard to connect the various plotlines that she looses track of her story's message; with the ambiguous conclusion of the mother's affair, Skyler misses her best opportunity to deliver a strong statement.<br /><br />Ultimately, I recommend skipping this book, and hoping that Skyler gets a good editor for her second novel.her writing is just not compelling.

In \\"An Unfinished Life,\\" ten year old Griff is an extremely likeable young person.  Her mother's choice of boyfriends has made Griff wise beyond her years, but at her core she is a sweet and unaffected child.  Everyone in the book is charmed by Griff, and I'm sure most readers will be too. <br /> <br />The adults, even the story, revolve around Griff; her mother Jean and grandfather Einar only connect through Griff.  The pretty Jean, unfortunately, comes across a hollow character known chiefly for her wanton ways.  Crusty at first, Einar is a character who proves as likeable as young Griff. <br /> <br />The most memorable scenes in the book chart the relationship that blossoms between Griff and Einar, two generations previously lost to each other by a tragic death.  At first Einar is unhappy having his daily routine disturbed, but after a few challenging early mornings Griff wins his respect.  Endearingingly, Einar surveys another child about his favorite sandwich, and then stops off at the store to buy the ingredients to make a PBJ for his new granddaughter. <br /> <br />I never like to give the plot away when I review a book, so I will simply support my 4 star recommendation by saying that Griff and her grandfather are wonderful characters to meet.  You'll find yourself rooting for their happiness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-20

I have to admit, I read through this book waiting for a reference, a connection, between the protagonist and Minneapolis' iconic heroine MTM.  Alas, I did not come across any reference, but I do think Shannon Olson merits a comparison to the pluckiest single gal in the Twin Cities! <br /> <br />Yes, I think Shanny and Mary are cut from the same cloth -- two smart, kind-hearted, thirty-something women who can never seem to meet \\"Mr. Right.\\"  In between tears of dismay, these two gals find resilience in a healthy sense of humor.  Ellie is a blend of married Phyllis and buddy Rhoda, while Adam represents Mr. Grant, Murray and Ted all rolled into one.  Shanny's parents are perhaps more like Rhoda's parents Ida and Martin, but I have to give a special nod to Shanny's Dad.   \\"Flo\\" might get all the big press, and she certainly has a wacky martini personality, but I truly appreciate the quietly loving and loveable Dad.  Although she refers to her mom constantly, I think Shanny is truly her father's daughter -- in sense and sensibility! <br /> <br />Having taken my hat off to Dr. Olson as a great dad, however, I have to warn the reader that the book is not a cheerful tale.  As Shannon pursues a husband and happiness, she encounters a great deal of disappointment and heartache.  Certainly, we are rooting for this brassy young lady as we follow her tale, but it never seems like she's going to get what she most desires.  Of course wondering \\"why?\\" is what keeps single ladies busy, and their friends are what keep them going.  <br /> <br />No review of \\"Children of God Go Bowling\\" would be complete without a nod to the intelligent writing that is so great to read.  Our gal bemoans her dateless plight in this passage:  Everyone else had a designated person, it seemed.  Everyone else came as a Value Pack, two products of equal size, held tightly together in plastic.  I was like a big bottle of lotion that came with a tiny trial size.  Each date I went on was like another trail-size product.  Fun to try, easy to toss away. <br /> <br />Later on, Shannon compares herself to the competition:  Lucy had nothing to worry about.  Clearly in the Darwinian survival game of dating and barhopping, she had opposable thumbs and was swinging vine to vine.  I was some kind of sedentary land animal who nibbled on marshy plants and moved too slowly to avoid predators.  Soon I would be extinct. <br /> <br />Anyone who can express herself so intelligently deserves a companion who admires her brain, right?  That's my hope for Shannon!	2004-11-20

To me the promise of the book was the possibility of discovering a uniquely powerful perspective that could transform an unlikeable protagonist into someone sympathetic.  I was disappointed, however, that Lionel Shriver's portrayal of a sadistic child was only that.   Once Kevin's story is completely revealed, the stark ending of the book fails to offer anything hopeful or remotely redemptive.  Shriver plays with the possibility that an unloving mother may be to blame, but she never makes a conclusive cause-and-effect link.  Dad's a brainless nincompoop, and Eva, the shadowy mother, never seems to be all there.  Always reacting to Kevin's behavior, Eva never does anything proactive, like bringing Kevin to a pyschiatrist.  When she lets her six year old son hold a secret over her head, she acts unbelievably weak-willed.  It certainly seems that Shriver did extensive research into violent teens, yet I wonder if the same amount of research was invested in Eva's character.  Ultimately, I'm not sure whether Shriver wants us to contemplate the psyche of a child like Kevin or the pysche of a parent who is at a complete loss when it comes to parenting.	2004-11-20

The Eyre Affair is a modern Alice in Wonderland -- expect the unexpected in this fantastically fun, original and highly intelligent book.  Jasper Fforde deserves the highest literary accolades for successfully breaking away from the dreary and predictable formula shaping most contemporary literature.   <br /> <br />I read this book aloud to my husband and we laughed all the way.  I won't relate the plot, but I can't resist shining the spotlight on some especially delightful moments.  For anyone who appreciates both Shakespeare and \\"The Rocky Horror Show,\\" the Richard III play is a hoot. Uncle Mycroft's carbon copy foreign language translator is equally priceless. A huge fan of science fiction, my husband also appreciated the time warp that opened up on the motorway.   <br /> <br />All of the characters are imbued with colorful and intriguing personalities. As the main character, Thursday is a steady constant, the prism through which we are entertained by the parade of other characters.  Thursday's scenes with her father and her brother, for example, are both refreshingly real and absurdly humorous.  Then there's her casual encounter with the werewolf... <br /> <br />As a social commentary, The Eyre Affair touches on the instability inherent in a world where political power can be usurped by commerical interests ... a theme echoed in the rereleased \\"Manchurian Candidate!\\"  As a literary work, The Eyre Affair is a whimsical companion piece to Charlotte Bronte's original masterpiece.  How could Ms. Bronte not embrace a novel that ressurects Jane and Mr. Rochester -- into a world that reveres literature?  I'm sure she would excuse the intrusions into her plot,and even welcome the tours of curious bibliophiles.   <br /> <br />We used to imagine what it would be like to visit the moon; Jasper Fforde uses his imagination to transport us to an equally amazing literary landscape.  Fforde is an exceptionally creative and knowledgeable writer, and The Eyre Affair is a thrilling homage to great literature.   <br /> <br />	2004-09-18

Tightly controlled by her father, Kate is not free to think independently.  This novel depicts, in a chilling way, Kate's fearful submission to her father.  Her thoughts, actions and choices are all dictated by his beliefs -- everything that is, except her dreams.  <br /> <br />The ways in which the minister has achieved such control over his daughter are deeply disturbing. Exceedingly charasmatic as he preaches God's word, Mr. Carr is a tyrant at home as he dictates what his daughter needs to do to be \\"good.\\"  Using God to abuse his parental authority, Mr. Carr has made his daughter's existence a precarious one.   <br /> <br />Ms. Evans takes us slowly into this jarring reality; until Kate's classmate stays over we don't see how extremely dark and dismal her home is.  The golden aura surrounding her father is extinguished by a biting chill; to experience the minister's harsh dominion and demands for perfection is to understand why Kate uses her friends for self-preservation.  This is NOT your average story of teenage behavior.  This is a young woman who is using whatever resources are available to survive her father's forceful and unforgiving attention. <br /> <br />Kate's mother attempted to intervene once, with dire consequences.  Years later, Kate's dreams of her mother become increasingly vivid.  Ultimately, her mother's influence puts into action events that allow Kate to escape her father's grasp.  In a welcome resolution, true and selfless love prevails.  <br /> <br />To read this compelling novel is to enter into a thorny briar patch, but arrive at a field of soft grass and brightly-colored flowers.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-21

Steve Martin is one of the most talented, creative and intelligent individuals in Hollywood. Who else can lay claim to being such an exceedingly gifted comedien, actor, playwright and author?! <br />  <br />After reading The Pleasure of My Company, what struck me as most impressive was that not only did Steve Martin write a second terrific novel but this novel is nothing like his first! Far too many writers can work in only one style, and while their writing is solid each novel seems to mirror the first. <br />  <br />In The Pleasure of My Company, Steve Martin takes his talent in a decidedly different direction from Shopgirl. In fact, I wasn't even sure I was going to like the novel at first; the main character takes a bit of getting used to. His neurotic quirks and his tendency to overthink everything are, at first, fairly annoying. By the end of the novel, however, I was shaking my head in admiration. Steve Martin has constructed a story of sweetness and warmth; Daniel Pecan Cambridge ends up being one of the most likeable protagonists I've encountered.  <br />  <br />Yes, he has his idiosyncrasies but he also completely lacks pretense. In and around Los Angeles, this makes Daniel a compelling individual of rare integrity -- the opposite of Get Shorty's John Travlota, Swimming with Shark's Kevin Spacey or The Player's Tim Robinson. Hollywood does come to Daniel, in the form of Crime Show, but he remains blissfully uncorrupted. His neighbors enjoy his company because he asks nothing of them.  <br />  <br />Technically unable to function in society, Daniel is visited weekly by a young therapist. When her own life comes unraveled, its Daniel who provides the support and assistance she needs. Through this reversal of fortune, Daniel finds his focus pulled away from himself. Happily helping Clarissa and her young son, Daniel has less and less time to sustain his neurotic habits. As others begin to depend on him, Daniel's self-confidence grows. <br />  <br />You can'thelp but root for Daniel as the story develops, and he builds a life outside his apartment. When his selflessness is rewarded we all enjoy a happy ending. <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

Beyond the money she earns, we understand that Sonja is content with posing, but we never learn exactly why. A Norwegian in Wisconsin, her comfort speaking English is limited; even though Sonja serves as the inspiration for Weaver's artistic expression she seldom reveals herself. Mute, she is a compelling muse.  Submitting to the rigorous gaze of Ned Weaver means focusing on her muscles and her skin; perhaps Sonja's emotional grief is mercifully eclipsed by the focus on her physical self. Perhaps the chance to be frozen in place is the chance to stop feeling the pain of life or loss.  Perhaps the best place to escape is under the most intense scrutiny.  <br /> <br />Larry Watson explores the idea of duality with the other characters as well.  Ned, the artist, is both charming and cruel; he is a mysogynistic lover of women.  Harriet, Ned's wife, is a doormat who, on occasion, considers exacting revenge.  Henry, Sonja's husband, is both domineering and helpless; I think he is the most achingly real and vulnerable of the four characters.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading Montana 1948, and I enjoyed Orchard as well.  The relationships between the characters, the details of their environment and the possibilities that are never realized all combine to create a novel that is bittersweet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-07-29

The overwrought emphasis on gender, also, seemed to submerge the plot.  However, I am surprised that almost no one has commented on the ultimate corporate status of the university.  As an ironic comment on society, I thought it was perfect!  I also found it carried tremendous weight as a prediction of our Brave New World; secondary schools are already being transformed by privatization. <br /> <br />If you can get into the spirit of this book, it is a fun read as well as a cerebral brain teaser.  No, it doesn't all make sense but James Hynes launches you on a rollercoaster ride of robust storytelling in The Lecturer's Tale.	2004-07-24

I would caution would-be readers that &quot;mysterious&quot; doesn't always translate into &quot;mystery.&quot;  This is not a who-dunit tale with clues and a solution; it's more of a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode with eerie possibilities.  TBOTB is an internal psychological nightmare that is similar to the age old quandry:  what if our dreams are reality and our reality is a dream?  Perception, afterall, is a relative concept built on individual needs and assumptions. <br />The confluence of contradictions and questions that characterizes this book is brilliantly staged in the opening scene -- an intimate family crisis unfolds aboard the yellow schoolbus. The town schoolbus is an adroit choice by Schupack, layering the suggestion of order, and the noisey neighborliness of the community, onto the family's core problem.    <br />When we leave the physical confines of the bus, the book meanders through the tangled maze of the mom's mind, metaphorically represented by the woods near their white farmhouse.  Unfortunately, the mom's rantings and whining become somewhat tiring as the book progresses. Her identity crisis is too solopsistic to be compelling.  It is not surprising that she has driven her partner and daughter out of the house; her character is truly annoying!<br />As a secondary school english teacher, I might be interested in reading just the first chapter to my students. Since their life experience wouldn't lead them to the mother's identity crisis, I would hope to hear what changes in a child's life might make them feel so profoundly different.  Then again, they might be more interested in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; possibilities of external agents ....<br />In sum, this is a novel that invites contemplation.  Schupack's fluid prose transports us into a world swirling with elusive possiblities.  Hop aboard!	2003-09-20

Rather, it seems to me that the author is trying to tell a bigger story, incorporating all of Susie's family.  (The title itself refers to the larger framework of what holds the family together.)  In attempting to tell a story of this scope, however, I think Sebold took on too much.  <br />For myself and many of the other readers, the book lost its claim on us once we got beyond its initial impact.  Is our focus the strain that threatens her parent's marriage?  What about Susie's sister?  her wacky but well-meaning grandmother?  Sebold would have done well to either limit the number of characters we follow, or limit the length of time in which we follow them.  Lindsey, Susie's sister, is a very spirited and interesting character at first.  By the time we've followed her to college, her character's essence has been so severely diluted that it's almost nonexistent.  <br />Within this unsatisfying whole, I did discover some gems such as the idea that, from crisis to crisis, a huband or wife usually has the other to \\"be strong\\" for them.  The tragedy of a murdered child, however, is a tidal wave that spins them apart even as it comes crashing down on their heads.  <br />I enjoyed the simple heaven of crayola colors that Sebold gives us; this certainly seems like heaven through the eyes of a schoolchild.  Of course heaven has swings!  <br />I also appreciate how Sebold blends eerie possibility into this fictional tale when Susie's young brother, Buckley, sees his sister.  Many people have observed something like this!  After my mother died, my young nephew would regularly look into the corner of the living room and smile.  <br />Unfortunately, I'm afraid Sebold lost control over her story when Susie returns to Earth.  To me, the \\"body-switch\\" feels false and out-of-synch.   For one thing, I can't accept that a girl who had been violated would experience her happiness through sex. <br />Don't let the hype getyou!  This book may boast an intriguing  premise, but it fails to maintain its promise.	2003-09-19

Although I had a terrific education, I never had the chance to participate in a bee; reading about the experience is the closest I'll get!<br />That said, this book is only marginally about Spelling Bees.  Beyond that point, I have to conclude that the book will find only a particular niche of readers.   I myself am not Jewish, and was totally lost in the background of this story.  It was interesting to discover the existence of a religion that views letters as the conduit to the divine, but my appreciation of the story was necessarily limited to the characters.<br />Many readers have divided their reactions character by character: Eliza; Saul; Miriam and Aaron.  I am intrigued by the fact that I seem to be the only one who reacted to the relationship between the two main characters, Eliza and Saul.  You can't follow Eliza without acknowledging how much her father is directing her path; you can't help but wince as his interference causes her to trip in the spotlight.  Saul is painted as a character who has generally given in to his needs in a manner that is terribly unappealing; the way he inflicts his needs on his compliant daughter should make any parent shudder.  How can a religious man be so uncontrollably selfish? <br />Yet our main character, the young Eliza, is so innocent that she basks in his attention.  I especially like the scene where the two bond over cake, hiding the evidence when they discover they've eaten the entire treat.  I would have enjoyed the novel so much more if the father's role had been genuinely loving; the way he used his daughter, purportedly for religious enlightenment, was too disturbing for me.<br />If this were a tv show, I would suggest dumping the three dark characters, and spinning off the delightful Eliza into her own show.  This spunky young lady deserves our attention; she has chutzpah!	2003-08-27

When she first encounters the Pritchard twins, she is intrigued by their quiet intensity.  The three children quickly discover that they all enjoy flirting with danger. However, Lily is able to laugh at herself, and the situation, when she admits that she can't tell the twins apart.  Her practical solution is perfect, and reappears years later with romantic resonance when Oren comes to claim his bride.<br />Lily devotes her life to caring for her new husband, but she also brings his war-wounded brother into their house. Lily, Oren and Ian are bound together by their lack of pretense, but the book turns when they discover they need to act like other people want them to be.  With their unsual domestic arrangement no longer tolerated by the community, the threesome must split up with awkward and hurtful consequences. <br />Art Corrveau writes impressively from the perspective of our protagonist -- whether she is responding to a handsome suitor, or trying to duck her obnoxious neighbor.  He also weaves an interesting story that allows her to grow in unpredictable ways. If you are a fan of Alice Hoffman, who crafts tales that are magical and sensual, you will be happy reading Housewrights as well.<br />Enjoy!	2003-08-27
US	46789648	R1V56JHTPTN7GD	0375707972	153296191	The Reader	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An engaging meditation	\\"The Reader\\" is a book to savor.  Expertly written, this book pulls you in with moments of bliss and wonder as our protagonist's quiet life suddenly explodes with passion and yearning.  The novel then shifts from the physical to the philosophical, as Michael encounters the uncertainties behind the ecstasy. We hear all this from the perspective of a grown man, carefully considering a lifetime of choices.<br />As he unravels and examines his life, Michael confronts questions that are universal in scope. In relationships, in life, we are all faced with choices and our choices have consequences.  Wrestling with one's own choices is necessarily a lifetime endeavor, but in \\"The Reader\\" it is evident how choices we made long ago can stay with us.  <br />We also find ourselves in situations that require us to judge the choices of others.  This moral dilemna, constructing a reliable platform within our own ambiguous morality from which we can evaluate others, is wonderfully explored in this book.  <br />I found Michael's voice and character to be quite likeable and sympathetic; in his unassuming way, he is sweet and charming.  Fate pairs him up with Hanna, a mysterious older woman, and he tumbles into love.<br />Years later, still uneasy about questions of his own guilt in betraying Hanna, Michael unexpectedly finds himself in a courtroom where Hanna's larger actions as an SS guard are being judged. <br />As her former lover, Michael is in an unusal position.  Michael struggles to match the Hanna who called him \\"Kid\\" with the camp guard guilty of such unpardonable crimes.  The time he spent reading to Hanna provides the prism through which he views her now.  Remembering how this time they shared was a warm and intimate part of their trysts, and hearing that Hanna selected certain prisoners to read to her within the walls of the camp, Michael chooses to believe that his former lover's actions were not unkind.  <br />In a stark and dramatic scene, Michael encounters an older man who suggests that it was possible to kill the Jews because the Germans involved were indifferent.  Michael is appalled by this idea, and despite her guilty verdict Michael can't be indifferent to Hanna.  His care and concern for her continue throughout his life; he resumes the role of her reader. <br />We never know exactly what Hanna is thinking, but her final actions are arresting. Inspired by Michael's recorded books, enough to become a reader herself, she nonetheless loses faith in herself when Michael fails to address her in his own words.  Michael realizes only too late that Hanna felt the sting of his inability to forgive her.   <br />All in all, a very thoughtful and complicated novel wrapped in a concise and rewarding package.  Setting \\"The Reader\\" against the Holocaust may be upsetting to some people, but it does indeed serve as a larger mirror against which our protagonist can measure his own worth.	2002-08-09
US	46789648	R2BHDP3X4BR789	0446674931	559910566	Four Letters of Love	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A book of lyrical fiction	I challenge anyone to read this novel and not feel a restless ache echo in their hearts!  <br />Niall Williams invites us to visit an island of deep, rich emotional landscape.  Buffeted by winds and driving rains, his characters are stripped to the essence of their souls; Williams reveals the anguish, pain and desire that wrench his characters into the unknown.  The world in which these characters struggle is terrifically wild and raw (like Yeats) but sweet and stirring as the feckless sun.  <br />A lifetime on these stony shores hardens the residents to the bittersweet blows of life, but never sweeps away the hope and belief that redemption is possible.  To various degrees, Muiris and Margaret Gore, Bette and William Coughlin accept that their place in life is set by their master.  Their hope is transferred to their children.  <br />As they each leave home and set out to find their lives, Nicholas and Isabel represent the innocence, desire and possibility of youth.  \\"Four Letters of Love\\" can be seen as a love of life, pursued through a contest of wills -- can the Gores guide Isabel and Nicholas to the \\"right\\" outcome, or do the two young lovers have a chance of defying the odds?  Throw in some magical (or mystical) realism, and all bets are off ... these mortals stumble in the presence of an all-powerful God, who alone determines the outcome of each invdividual life. <br />Through evocative prose and fantastic imagery, Williams transports his reader to a place of intense truths and ethereal possibilities.  This blend of life's grit and life's promise exactly mimics the twist in Irish nature; it's lovely to read a work of modern fiction that embodies that essence so well.<br />Against the backdrop of the alluring and unruly sea, I also enjoyed the intuitions Williams reveals in regards to love.  To know love is to know its failures; to embrace love is a fool's choice, but one we have no power to resist.  Hurling headlong into love means risking everything, but wanting more.<br />Unfortunately, the end of this novel does disappoint, and I want to ask Williams to go back and give us the ending that matches the dynamic turmoil of the novel.  I was desperate to hear from Isabel again; an ending without her presence leaves a terrible void.  Even if the idea is that, in the end, all choices are made for us by God, I think we at least need to hear Isabel's reaction.  Knowing that she kissed Nicholas, and her mother is overcome with \\"sudden foreknowledge\\" that Isabel will return home is just not enough -- our strong-willed heroine should not end the story bound and mute.  <br />Overall, I would suggest this book to anyone who would like to massage their imagination with the lush, sensory stimulation of Ireland ... a balm for the bruises that come from our awkward and clumsy dance with the sublime nature of love.	2002-08-04

Very much alike in their stubborn &amp; feisty personalities, Josie and her Uncle Harvey are both exceedingly uncomfortable around the other members of the family.  Following a few disastrous events, they land together in a situation that is hilariously played out by Josie's ability to rise to the occasion.  <br />Jean Thompson does a great job in creating these two; I especially enjoy that a character as young as Josie possesses such a bold personality and that old Harvey is not quite as out to lunch as others assume.  Elaine, Josie's mother, is a rather bland character serving to connect these two but it is Rolando, the wild card from California, who ultimately binds them together and catapults the story to its frenzied conclusion.  <br />Like some of the other readers, I must admit not caring much for Rolando -- the harsh nature of his character is a disturbing and discordant note in &quot;Wide Blue Yonder.&quot;   Thankfully, Thompson has also created a wonderful stout and non-English speaking maid who eclipses Rolando's ugliness of spirit with her own trust in life. Through her pained love affair, Josie may well represent the heart of the novel, but it is in this wonderful character of steel and grace, unencumbered by words, that Thompson embodies the soul of her novel.<br />So while the summer sun is still shining, I think you'll find &quot;Wide Blue Yonder&quot; a satisfying read.	2002-07-18

Unfortunately for the reader, New York City merely factors in as background and the primary characters in the book, Roz and Edwin, are similarly undeveloped.    <BR>Initially, Edwin appears to be an interesting character.  Younger, polite, Midwestern, and a goy; this great wash of contrasts to Roz, the stereotypical New Yorker, seems quite promising.  Unfortunately, Edwin vanishes half way through the book, leaving us with Roz.  <br />Initally the character of Roz is defined by her tendency to be impulsive.  At this point we learn that she has chosen to practice law, a puzzling shift which I'm not sure the author can justify.<br />The only consistently interesting, and developed, character in this book is Miranda, the daughter.  Followed throughout her teenage years, Miranda demonstrates a personality that is both nuanced and layered.  With subtle shifts between youth and maturity, confidence and insecurity, Miranda keeps us guessing. We appreciate that she is a thoughtful young woman, even though we are not always privy to her thoughts.  The occasions where Miranda explores relationships with young men are especially well written.  (The author appears to be young enough that her own experiences might be fresh enough to remember?!)<br />All in all, however, I can't recommend this book to someone who is facing shelves and shelves of choices.  If the author continues to pursue writing, I would expect her books to deepen in maturity and depth.	2002-07-01

To start, this is a vast difference in age between Gabe and Elisa and ultimately, there is the decidely immature way in which Elisa behaves after she discovers that she has a serious disease.<br />Pairing these two individuals, Joan Silber skillfully constructs a story that acknowledges the gaps, but emphasizes the shaky platforms that bridge the differences.  This is a love story that contains some hard truths; I appreciate how Silber conveys how people can act hurtfully even when they love someone dearly.<br />Elisa's behavior is often sour; Gabe is the character who imbues the novel with its sweetness.  His maturity is stronger and steadier than Elisa's foolishness, and will anchor them through the deepest waters.<br />My hesitation with the book, however, is that Gabe is so unwavering that he almost seems like one of those perfect Ayn Rand characters! I realize novels are not held up to any literary requirements as far as truthfulness, but I think Silber would have delivered a stronger story had Gabe wrestled with some doubts before he embraced Elisa and her complicated demands on his love.	2002-07-01
US	46789648	R1QRAGTMPNSL77	0375507086	238592866	Too Close to Call: The Thirty-Six-Day Battle to Decide the 2000 Election	Books	5	7	17	N	N	An eye-opener	Before I proceed with my review of this book, I will acknowledge that I am a liberal democrat and, as such, I support the concepts of justness and integrity exemplified by Al Gore in this recent Presidential campaign.  <br />Nonetheless, after reading Jeffrey Toobin's book, I was shocked to discover to what depths the Republican party will sink ...  James Baker, instructing Kathryn Harris to \\"take it in for a landing.\\"  The absentee ballot fiasco that ultimately became \\"Thanksgiving stuffing.\\"  The physical threat of mob violence that the Bush-backers incited to disrupt the Miami-Dade recount... <br />How completely disheartening to learn that the man currently leading our country obtained his position through the schemes, threats and lies of his staff.  Most of us are aware that politics can be somewhat dicey, but we still want to believe in the process whereby we vote, our vote is counted, and the candidate with the most votes wins.  Jeffrey Toobin's book clearly points out, in a dozen different ways, why this was most decidely not the case with our recent Presidential election.<br />Toobin opens his book with an astute analysis of the situation.  Supporting the idea that an accurate recount would decide the winner, Gore pursued a legal battle \\"by the books.\\"  The Bush camp, however, waged a political battle, and fought by continuing their campaign.  It turned out to be not only a smear campaign, against Al Gore, but, most successfully, a campaign for the favor of the most important voters in the country, the Supreme Court.  <br />I would imagine this is the section of the book that bothers Republican readers; the author represents that Baker enlisted his troops to stall the recount, and thereby protect George W's premature victory. Yet it is hard to ignore the compelling evidence that in the counties and in the courts, the recount process was sideswiped by false accusations, trampled by belligerence, misdirected by the Secretary of State, or slyly thwarted by Jeb's cronies.  <br />From the Democratic bench, Toobin reports on the limitations of Warren Christopher as the nominal leader, the failure of Joe Lieberman to uphold the Democratic challenge when the absentee ballots surfaced, and the dismal fashion in which the Democrats failed to unite. Pursuing a self-determined course of action, Al Gore may have lost because he put too much faith in the system.<br />Baker, on the other hand, was a master at manipulating the system.  While George W was planning his cabinet selections, Baker orchestrated the ultimate showdown.  With the election now wrested from the largely Democratic Florida Supreme Court, and safely in the largely Republican-appointed Supreme Court, a 5-4 decision meant that Al Gore lost by one vote, and George W was in the White House.  Mission accomplished. <br />A presidential election with no clear winner may be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but it could also be an impetus for change. \\"Too Close to Count\\" is a powerful book because it opens up the question, \\"Where do we go from here?\\"	2002-06-19

I chose to read this book because I thought I might encounter some interesting thoughts about the scholarly Shakespeare.  That is not at all what the book is about!  This is a book about only one thing:  the phenomenal ego of Herman Gollub.  Unless you are a close personal friend of this man, I don't recommend that you invest your time in this book.  If you are a psychology student, studying the distorted perception of an oversized ego, than it might be worth your while.  This book may have been helped by a vigorous editor; perhaps the individual in this case was reluctant to edit a peer.  As a serious reader, I have no hesitation in warning other serious readers to stay far away from the narcissistic, self-congratulating drivel in &quot;Me and Shakespeare.&quot;	2002-06-05
US	46789648	R1WEP19HJUZUYU	0374248613	334743649	The Rehearsal	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An interesting prism	I found this second book by Sarah Willis to be a good read, in large part because of its original approach.  Willis puts the rehearsal for &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; center stage; we learn about the troubled family members as they walk into scene, work backstage or look on as spectator. <br />As if we were looking through a kaleidoscope, we see the characters develop, discontinue, or renew relationships with each other in subtle shifts; the novel benefits from this multi-layered texture.  Willis also demonstrates her skill as an author by maintaining a deliberate pace throughout these shifts.  Certainly the stakes become more and more intense, and as a reader, you can't help but think ahead to the final scene, but in this book the conclusion is not one you can predict.<br />From the start, it is apparent to the reader how Will's role as director eclipses his role as husband and father.  How much he has ignored his family becomes starkly evident in the climax of the book, but as the cast rehearses there are plenty of other surprises along the way.  <br />My only criticism would be in regard to the character of Beth, the bratty teenage daughter.  In an otherwise rich ensemble of characters, this painfully screechy character is the only discordant note.  I realize her character functions as a catalyst, but I would have preferred it if she had been less hysterical.  I was a sixteen year old girl once; we're not that bad!	2002-01-29

I have to admit that I am an intellectual supporter of Baker since his attempt a few years back to save the nation's card catalogues.  In &quot;Double Fold,&quot; Baker's basic message is the same -- once something is gone, it's gone.  This time, however, the situation is far more dire.  <br />First we lost card catalogues, which EVERYONE preferred to the electronic substitute because card catalogues allowed for browsing.  (You can still browse through the cards in the San Francisco library; they were made into wallpaper.) Now Baker wants us to be aware of the money-driven international destruction of one-of-a-kind newspaper runs, journals, magazines and books. <br />Yes, the exposee gets fairly dry (no pun intended)as Baker traces the swirl of scientific debate surrounding the acidity and durability of paper and microfilm, and he dwells at length on the bureacratic black hole which ensnares any lucid thinking in the &quot;life or death&quot; decisions that are made regarding archival material. <BR> <BR>For the interested reader who sticks with it, however, this report is studded with gems. The highly questionable use of the highly combustible chemical agent DEZ?  The use of mummies?  The mass destruction of all bound books as proposed by those opting for a digital warehouse? Sounds like bad science fiction, but it's all true!<br />Ultimately, Baker does reveal that the fate of our archival material hinges on the availability of money and, in a particularly perverse equation, the more money that has been made available the greater the loss of material. Each year, a prescribed percentage of library material will be pronounced &quot;brittle&quot; and torn apart for filming in a dubious &quot;preservation&quot; process made possible by bountiful grants. <br />Preservation by way of microfilm is great for the microfilm industry, a boost for the library's contemporary image, and a  significant loss to the public and the research community.  Manipulating a spool of microfilm and making printouts is a tedious and potentially expensive enterprise with no guarantees regarding legibility.  Baker's passionate belief is that a spool of microfilm is in no way equivalent to the original.<br />I applaud Baker's effort to unearth and reveal the truth buried under years of lies and propaganda.  Based on his research, Baker is right to cry out &quot;Hey, everybody.  Our libraries are destroying historical material unnecessarily and I don't like it!&quot;  For anyone who cherishes the printed word, this is an alarming and necessary wake-up call.	2002-01-08

The cynical profiles of Chip, Gary and Denise do not add up to a satisfactory sum, nor do I think they stand strongly on their own.  Narrowly defining them from their mother's perspective, the author has failed to establish any other expectations for these three primary characters.  In this vacuum, their failings and virtues are flat and meaningless.  <br />In contrast, I'd like to refer to Jane Hamilton's terrific novel &quot;The Short History of a Prince.&quot;  Hamilton depicts a family of (quirky) individuals, knitting their stories together in a manner both lyrical and resonant.  This is a novel that successfully creates, and delivers, a valid perspective.  In my opinion, &quot;The Corrections&quot; fails to offer such a reward.	2001-12-16

I think the key is that Mr. Sides has presented the human aspect of war, rather than the military. How can you read this book and not feel full of emotion for the POWs, the Rangers, and the Filipinos who gave their blessings, as well as their oxen? In a day when we are hard put to identify a hero, the Ghost Soldiers and their rescuers are an elite assembly. Hampton Sides has given our history books a good tweak -- this story of how our own fathers and grandfathers held their ground through the most precarious of situations reveals the world around us in startling perspective. I am not a fan of war, but after reading this book I salute the amazing and inexhaustible spirit of our soldiers.	2001-09-10
