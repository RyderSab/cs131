When my sister brought her family to visit this past June, we consulted this book every hour of every day. The adults and the children all found it invaluable for both identifying plants and animals and learning something about their life history. No, the guide is not all-encompassing, but most of the major players are here. I especially appreciated the inclusion of the little guys- especially the beetles lizards! We also appreciated the extremely sturdy binding, which held up well against all of the abuses that a 9-year-old could think of.	2001-08-31

Too much doom and gloom consumes the soul.<BR>Imagine, then, the thrill of discovering Douglas Adams' &quot;Last Chance to See!&quot; Adams' compassion (for all things, excepting perhaps a certain variety of tourist) is obvious and his sense of humor is contagious. His insights into life as an endangered species and our relationship to the natural world are equally remarkable.<BR>This book is a quiet little miracle.

Aldo Leopold became the most exalted member of my personal pantheon of saints.  Aldo Leopold became inspiration incarnate, but lost his humanity in the process.  He could do no wrong.<br />Then I read Curt Meine's biography.  Leopold's famous essay, &quot;Thinking Like a Mountain,&quot; chronicles only one of the many lessons learned in a life filled with equal parts reckless bravado and deep introspection.  Leopold launched his career as a fortunate son, cocksure and itching to change the world, only to learn that real change takes patience, commitment, hard work, compassion, and an open mind willing to learn.  Sound familiar?<br />I read Curt Meine's biography before I read Marybeth Lorbiecki's &quot;Fierce Green Fire.&quot;  To be honest, I enjoyed both, but found Meine's biography to be more fulfilling.  If you want to understand where the Land Ethic really came from, pick up &quot;His Life and Work.&quot;	2001-08-16

Stuart Pimm's &quot;Balance of Nature&quot; is intended for an audience of professional ecologists and (like most academic texts) demands patient, thoughtful reading, but is well worth the effort.<br />Why influential?  Throughout my rather lengthy graduate school &quot;career,&quot; I've been struck by the tension between simple academic ecological theory and the stunning complexity of real-world systems.  Pimm tackles this condumdrum by focusing on the relationship between species richness and system stability, explaining why the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br />If your ecological education has not already made you suspicious of popular (but naive) concepts of &quot;natural&quot; stability and balance, then this book will open your eyes.  Recommended.	2001-07-18

Because of its size, it is not the best guide for long day hikes or overnight backpacks- unless you need the extra exercise!<br />The Sibley guide should find a valued place on every birder's bookshelf.  No doubt most hardcore birders already own it.  One word of caution: in my experience, amateur enthusiasts often find the Sibley guide's expansiveness intimidating- these should start out with a simpler guide and work their way up.	2001-07-18

This was the first synthesis of landscape ecology, wildlife biology, and forest management that I encountered, and I still refer to it today.  Unlike many scholarly works, Hunter's treatment easily lends itself to operational, on the ground applications.  Likewise, the prose is straightforward and suitable for those new to the field.

I wish I could write like these authors!  The editing is first-class and a joy to read.  Given the list of contributors, how could you lose?  The organization is also quite logical, with papers organized into landscape- and stand-level topics.<br />For those of you who like to know what you're buying, here are the authors and their contributions (all of the chapters are excellent): Hunter: Biological diversity // Hunter and Seymour: Principles of ecological forestry // Palik and Engstrom: Species composition // Spies and Turner: Dynamic forest mosaics // Hansen and Rotella: Abiotic factors // Matlack and Litvaitis: Forest edges // Haila: Islands and fragments // Brinson and Verhoeven: Riparian forests // Calhoun: Wetlands // McComb and Lindenmayer: Dying, dead, and down trees // Brokaw and Lent: Vertical structure // Moore and Allen: Plantation forestry // Thompson and Angelstam: Special species // Millar: Genetic diversity // Frelich and Puettman: Restoration ecology // Norton: Forest reserves // Oliver, Boydak, Segura, and Bare: Forest organization, management, and policy // Lippke and Bishop: The economic perspective // Maguire: Social perspectives //<br />This book is borrowed more often than any of the others in my collection.

His depictions of leaf senescence, cold adaptation, and migrations are excellent.  I especially appreciate the literary contributions (from Thoreau and others), which help balance the generally technical presentation.<br />For most of us, autumn is a time of contrasts, with brilliant colors fading to winter's gloom.  So Marchand's decision to use black-and-white photographs, intended to help us &quot;see beyond the sometimes distracting color of the season,&quot; is a bit puzzling.  His photographs are beautiful, but I can't help but wonder how they would have looked in color.  Apparently black-and-white is distracting!<br />Minor quibbles aside, Peter Marchand has once again proven that he has a gift for helping us see the obvious and understand the unseen.

As suggested by the title, the emphasis is on  forage, nutrient requirements, energy demands, and production.<br />Robbins  tackles the subject from a physiological, rather than strictly ecological,  standpoint.  Not surprisingly, ungulates (both wild and domestic) provide  most of the resources, although Robbins takes pains to make his discussions  as general as possible.<br />&quot;Wildlife Feeding and Nutrition&quot; is  positively packed with literature, charts, figures, tables, and even a few  photographs.<br />This is not a how-to manual for veterinarians and  zookeepers, but instead a synthesis of physiological concepts.<br />All  together, a well-written reference.

Books	4	17	17	N	N	Oriented toward physiology	Schmidt-Nielsen's &quot;Scaling: why is animal size so important&quot; is a readable introduction to the influence of size on physiology (and vice versa).  As noted in a previous review, the chapter describing structural  engineering is relatively weak, but the chapters discussing allometric  concepts, metabolism, thermoregulation, and physiological time are  excellent. Other chapters address respiration and  circulation.<br />Unfortunately, Schmidt-Nielsen glosses over the ecological  ramifications of the physiological mechanisms described in this book.  For  the ecologically oriented, I recommend Calder's &quot;Size, function, and  life history.&quot;<br />All in all, an eye-opener and a heck of a lot more  fun to read than most technical works.	2000-06-26

Peter Turchin's &quot;Quantitative Analysis of Movement&quot; is the best (only?) available synthesis of techniques appropriate for analyzing movement patterns.  Turchin addresses general concepts, techniques for  measuring movements, movement models (mostly diffusion-based), techniques  for analyzing movement paths, and mark-recapture techniques.  Be aware,  however, Turchin's analysis is more appropriate to displacement and  redistribution questions and less suited for those interested in inferring  motivation from movement trajectories.<br />This is an intensely mathematical  treatment, so be prepared.  Turchin is kind enough to provide a special  appendix, &quot;Diffusion for Ecologists,&quot; for those with relatively  weak mathematical backgrounds (like myself).  Not easy to understand but  well worth the effort.	2000-06-24

Kershaw et al. provide  simple, easy-to-use keys and organize plants by growth form (trees, shrubs,  flowers), family, and color, so that both beginners and botanists can  navigate with ease.  Photographs are typically small, but the entire plant  is shown, usually in its native habitat.  Descriptions typically include  relatives, uses, and occasionally an amusing anecdote.<br />As a cautionary  note, &quot;Plants of the Rocky Mountains&quot; is intended to be used in  the mountains, and is less useful in deserts, basins, or canyon country.

Simple  photographs and line drawings are provided for some of the most common and  especially important plant and animal species. If you're looking for a  conventional field guide, however, this ain't it.  Instead, &quot;The North  Woods&quot; is a guide to communities and ecosystems.

Here are my impressions:<br />The book is very well organized; chapters introduce  new concepts incrementally, and the overall flow is very good.  The authors  start with the classical patch and prey models, adding complexity in later  chapters.  Separate chapters address trade-offs and simultaneous  optimization, dynamic optimization, and rules-of-thumb.  The concluding  chapters consider model testing and the success of the optimization  paradigm.<br />The writing is somewhat stiff, but still pretty good for a  technical work.  The bit about how great tits rarely feed on conveyor belts  in nature is an exemplar of scientific understatement.<br />If mathematics are  not your strong point, or your background is weak, you will have a hard  time with many of the proofs.  I skipped over most of these sections  expecting to get the gist of the material, only to regret my decision  during my comprehensive exams!<br />While Stephens and Krebs provide a  thorough overview of the material, &quot;Foraging Theory&quot; suffers from  one serious flaw.  The presentation focuses on model development, rather  than analysis and interpretation.  In order to truly understand these  models, the student absolutely must work through &quot;real&quot; examples  under the tutelage of an experienced mentor.<br />The binding has held up very  well.  The book looks nearly new, despite having been stomped on several  times and thrown out a third-story window at least once.<br />Even after all  of these years, &quot;Foraging Theory&quot; still represents the  state-of-the-art in optimization-based approaches to behavioral analysis.	2000-06-19

The authors examine their subject from three complementary viewpoints: basic concepts, measurement and analysis, and management. Individual concepts are presented very clearly and the writing is first-rate. The authors provide a level of detail appropriate to an introductory overview.<br />While this text is suitable for an undergraduate course and provides an excellent basic reference, seasoned professionals may find it lacking. For example, more recent numerical techniques (such as resource selection functions) are beyond the book's scope.  Nevertheless, &quot;Wildlife-Habitat Relationships&quot; is admirably up-to-date in many respects, including excellent discussions of experimental approaches and scale, and I've referred to it many times during the course of my own Ph.D. work.	2000-06-16

From a modern perspective, the behavior of our colonial  forebears is often perplexing and sometimes downright criminal.  Why did  the Plymouth Pilgrims see the decimation of the Pawtuxet as Divine  Providence, instead of a horrific tragedy?  Why did French and English  colonists treat the natives so differently?  Quinn's treatment of these and  other issues are unparalleled. Instead of providing a detailed chronology  of events, Quinn emphasizes sociological context and individual  perspective.  Plenty of good history books can tell you what happened;  &quot;A New World&quot; explains why.  This can be a rough ride (Quinn is  no apologist), but like the best roller coasters, &quot;A New World&quot;  is well worth the trip.	2000-05-28

In &quot;Red Earth, White  Lies,&quot; Vine Deloria, Jr. clearly demonstrates how conjecture can  attain the status of fact, even in the face of overwhelming contradictory  evidence.  Perhaps even more condemning is Deloria's depiction of how  alternative ideas, most notably indigenous traditions, are frequently  (typically) cast aside without any investigation whatsoever, simply because  they conflict with currently accepted norms.<br />&quot;Red Earth, White  Lies&quot; is a wonderfully provocative indictment of how historical  sciences, such as anthropology, geology, and ecology (my own field)  frequently fail in practice.  Nevertheless, perhaps without realizing it,  Deloria relies on the very hallmarks of modern science; alternative  hypotheses, critical analysis, and crucial evidence, to make his  case.<br />Here, unfortunately, is where &quot;Red Earth, White Lies&quot;  loses much of its power.  While Deloria succeeds in casting doubt on many  beliefs cherished by entrenched academics, he typically does not subject  his own hypotheses to the same treatment. Even more unfortunate, Deloria  himself employs some of the techniques he most violently condemns in  academics, including the selective use of information (the most obvious  example is on page 58) and summary dismissal of entire world-views on the  basis of a superficial understanding (his entire discussion of evolutionary  biology, for example).<br />Even though &quot;Red Earth, White Lies&quot;  occasionally stumbles, Deloria has done all of us a great service, by  proving that scientists are only human and that many scientific  &quot;facts&quot; are in reality little more than conjectures.  If you  identify yourself as a &quot;scientist,&quot; you will be (and should be)  challenged!  If you are not a scientist, then perhapsyou will see those  who are in a whole new light.  &quot;Red Earth, White Lies&quot; is a  fascinating read, no matter who you are.	1999-12-12

Understanding elusive animals is a bit like being a detective: all you have are the clues they've left behind.  As a professional ecologist, I heartily recommend &quot;Tracking and the art of seeing&quot; to anyone  interested in the outdoors.  Paul (and Paulette!) have created a marvelous  contribution to both science and art.  I especially appreciate Paul's  emphasis on using all of your senses effectively, which is the most  difficult skill to master.<br />Sounds like a 5 star review so far, right?   Unfortunately, I feel compelled to warn those who live west of the  Mississippi that Paul does not discuss some of the West's most noteworthy  animals, including mule deer, bighorn sheep (he does discuss Dall sheep),  pronghorn, prairie dogs, badgers, and so on.  Likewise, Paul does not  include domestic cattle, sheep, goats, and horses, although I've discovered  that novices can often mistake these for wild ungulates.<br />Nevertheless,  &quot;Tracking and the art of seeing&quot; is a wonderful example of what  an outdoor reference can be: a source of both information and inspiration.

I would be  labeled an ecologist, a field that is currently creating very innovative  syntheses and expanding exponentially.  Other endeavors, like molecular  genetics, should be expected to come &quot;out of left field&quot; with  passing time.  Perhaps Horgan missed one important aspect of science: the  creation of entirely new fields of study.<br />Nevertheless, Horgan's work did  leave me with one very valuable lesson.  For many scientific endeavors,  ecology included, understanding the limits of what we can &quot;know&quot;  is just as important as the assimilation of new knowledge itself.  In this  way we can put a limit on our own hubris.	1999-09-05

As a consequence, his effort is long in vision but short on facts.  This is clearly a &quot;big  picture&quot; story, much like his topic, but without the details that pull  the pieces together.  I wish Pyne had spent a little more time presenting  facts, rather than pontificating his personal opinions.<br />Nevertheless, I  would have been happy with the work if Pyne's prose wasn't so tedious.  Big  words are not really the problem- they're just too many words,  period.<br />&quot;How the Canyon became Grand&quot; reads more like pompous  art criticism than an in-depth historical analysis.  If the latter is what  you want, look elsewhere.	1999-09-02

One of the hallmarks of rigorous science is the examination of alternative hypotheses and the subsequent  rejection of those that fail.  Bloom offers only one hypothesis (memes) and  supporting evidence but fails to examine alternative views (such as Jared  Diamond's proposals in &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;).  As a  consequence, I can't help feeling that I've only heard a small part of the  story.  For example, Bloom disregards the possibility of economic  ideological &quot;conquest&quot; entirely.<br />&quot;The Lucifer  Principle&quot; is well written and entertaining but fails to convince.	1999-08-16

This is not an in depth scholarly  historical work; readers looking for facts might want to look elsewhere.   Likewise, the odd organization of the photographs (C&amp;S photos in the  D&amp;RGW section) is unnerving.  However, for sheer entertainment value,  &quot;Narrow Gauge in the Rockies&quot; can't be beat.  A great  introductory book for railroad fans.	1998-08-23

However, casual readers should be aware that this work is first and foremost an academic analysis of transportation economics, and completely free of the glossy nostalgia characteristic of most railroad lore. His descriptions of individual railroads and the narrow-gauge phenomenon in general focus on economics (I now have a newfound respect for the word \\"receivership\\"), rather than the equipment and the frontier atmosphere that attract many railroad enthusiasts.  Nevertheless, the hard work pays off in the end: I now understand why common-carrier narrow gauge railroads were largely doomed to failure.	1998-08-23

I've read dozens of accounts of MacArthur and Wilson's influential Island Biogeography Theory; none stirred me the way this work does.  David Quammen's masterpiece should appeal equally to professional ecologists (such as myself) and laypersons.  How wonderful to see these pioneers as real people, rather than just dusty works in the library!  &quot;Song of the Dodo&quot; will be a valuable reference in my own classroom.	1998-07-01
