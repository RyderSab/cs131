Ray found a fortune when he was summoned to his father's house where he found him dead. The money is a shock since his father didn't make much and spent more. Grisham does a very good job with his characterization and describing the details.<br />This is a superb read that does get a bit slow when describing what Ray wants to do with the money. Being a horror fan and soon to be horror writer, this is contemporary fiction at it's best. Grisham is setting himself up to be a great writer, not a genre writer in the lawyer fashion he has shaped his career after. He is quite simply a GREAT storyteller.	2002-08-29

Koontz writes an excellent novel about a group of strangers thrown together after a gut instinct tells them to go west to a small city in rural Nevada. They find out that they know each other from years before and embark on a journey of a lifetime.<br />This is the type of epic that only King, McCammon, or Koontz could pull off. He writes with a flair for characterization and plotting. Koontz is just simply a master storyteller and it is a shame he doesn't have grandchildren. Koontz would make a perfect grandfather that tells stories.<br />Having corresponded with the author, I found out he has an outraegous sense of humor and is quite unselfish; he sent me his Dean Koontz companion when asked for advice on writing. That shocked me; he sent me a book that retails for [money] or more!!! Suffice to say, I am a lifetime fan!!<br />The only drawback I have is his novels lately contain some sci-fi and fantasy elements. I am not really into either of these, unless it's dark fantasy/horror, but it's not that much of a drawback. He just is too good a storyteller to complain about; then I feel guilty after all he's done for the literary world.<br />Koontz is King (no pun intended or maybe there is) and I hope he keeps writing till he's in his 70's!!	2002-08-28

This is one of Hautala's most disturbing books; BE WARNED THIS IS NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH!!!!<br />The story is about a villain raping young boys in a swampy atmosphere. I won't give away too much, but it isn't your typical slasher novel.<br />Hautala is one of horror's most underappreciated novelists. Although a lot of his stories revolve around ghost story plots, I like him. He does not \\"overwrite\\" as often as a lot of scribes trying to make their point. His characters range from cardboard cutouts (quickly disposed of) to fleshed out \\"creepy crawlies.\\" He has a knack for suspense without using the \\"Gross-out Factor\\" (although he can apply this at any time). <br />Hautala is a solid writer who knows how to scare and get under your skin. That's the best compliment I can give a horror writer!!!	2002-08-28

Hautala turns the tried-and-true ghost story into a different kind of story.

However, it is still a very impressive novel any HORROR LOVER SHOULD HAVE!!! If you enjoy Hautala, ITS A MUST BUY!!! (No I didn't get paid to endorse it, it is just that damn good)<br />I think Hautala is underappreciated in the horror field, just look at his cult classic, Little Brothers. That was a great 5-star book! He has been on the best-seller list, but I am not aware of him having ever won a Stoker or award from HWA!

This is your average horror novel that has a decent premise but you just get bogged by the slow-developing plot. However, Hautala is a solid writer who may have been experiencing a tight deadline or \\"writers block.\\"<br />However, I am sympathetic because anyone who has tried writing a novel knows how difficult it is. The story is still worth reading; pick it up in a used book store, garage sale. You could even buy it used here on Borders.com, but I wouldn't pay full price.<br />The story revolves around Sarah, who witnessed a crime. The attacker comes after her and she and her protector fight him off. Moves slowly, some of the characters aren't fully developed, but still a decent read.	2002-08-28

The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating was it bogs down at times and becomes a little tedious.<br />For people that haven't read Koontz, you are in for a treat! Koontz writes like a BAT OUT OF HELL and knows what scares us and what frightens! He is this century's great contemporary writer regardless of genre. He has done it all; sci-fi, fantasy, horror, mystery, even a little romance. The only thing he hasn't done is westerns and technical manuals.

Kind of like G'n'R's hit song, \\"Coma.\\"<br />\\"Buckeye Jim in Egypt\\" is another tale that is awesome. It talks of our society, racism, and the story about a wandering man with supernatural powers.<br />\\"Moon on the Water\\" is the title story and is an interesting read about jazz musicians who become entwined with a rich girl with an adrenaline rush-attitude. A good story.<br />\\"Altenmoor, Where the Dogs Dance\\" is also an interesting read about a boy and his grandfather who know about the afterlife.<br />A solid collection from a great writer!!!	2002-08-27

His characters are real and very funny.<br />   Taylor weaves a fascinating nightmare about a family that moves into a relative's house. A couple of incidents with neighbor, John Callow, get them off on the wrong start. He comes around to apologize, but strange deaths begin taking place. Its all related to the RUNES!! I will stop here, but the ending is a clincher.<br />   Taylor is awesome at keeping u interested. The opera doesn't fascinate me, but he described it very well and wanted me to care. A nice story from a guy who obviously knows it doesn't need to be gory, to be scary!!!	2002-08-26

This is the first of the series and it is a decent read, but at times looks like a first novel. It drags a bit but like I have said before Kellerman is not capable of writing a bad book. His average one's are better than 50 percent of what is being published today!<br />   Kellerman does a superb job of detailing a 7-year old who is the possible only witness to a crime and her down-and-out mother, who should take parenting classes. I won't give away much, but this shows enough to get u hooked on Kellerman, Delaware (the main character), and Milo (his friend). A worthy debut!<br />   Kellerman exhibits charcterization, smooth storytelling, and fantastic plotting. The only draw-back is lengthy conversations and parts that are a little slow. Nothing to convince u NOT to PURCHASE the BOOK!<br />   Good job, Jon!	2002-08-24

This sequel to Hungry Eyes is just as good as the original if not better!!! <br />   To my shock, Hoffman has left Leisure because a lack of PR, but this guy is too talented to remain unsigned by a major publishing house. He has a keen insight to sociological issues and is branching out to include the supernatural (Or so I am led to believe by Judas Eyes, which I will review when I get my hot little hands on it). YEAH!!!!<br />   This novel is so good on sooo many levels. Hoffman's signature characterization is splendid here and he includes a whole cast of personalitites here. He writes a smooth story and as previously written in other reviews, he has a clear and concise voice, avoiding \\"over-writing.\\"<BR>   <BR>   Hoffman is going to become a great writer and I am shocked he is only selling in the 200,000's on Amazon.com. This guy needs to be displayed to the public so they can gobble up everything this man dishes out! I for one am a life-long fan and will search out is work! And I was only so-so happy with the first novel I read by him, BORN BAD. That was a decent novel, still worth reading, just not overtly impressive. Sorry, Barry!!<br />   Look up the Prey series, you'll be glad and so will your mind!!	2002-08-23

He is also excellent at characterization and this is one of his best. He makes u care about these people and hate Peake.<br />   Milo has to be one of the best gum-shoe's in mystery fiction; he is interesting and not contemporary.

I am a die-hard horror buff and have recently branched out to other forms of literature. Kellerman is among the best in any genre, he writes with a clear and concise style that is easy to understand and enjoy.<br />  Kellerman's plots always have twists and turns just when u think u have it all figured out. He is a lot like John Saul without the supernatural influence; both men are great storytellers.<br />  Kellerman and his wife, Faye, are the best husband-wife combo out there (not that are a lot of them, but hey who's counting?) and both write best-sellers.<br />  Jonathon writes about real people and real activities; that is what is \\"scary\\". In horror, we are talking about far-fetched stuff for the most part. Kellerman writes about stuff that very possibly could and DOES happen!!<br />  The Kellerman household must be very busy and I think they are a very special couple. I read anything they put out because it is a sure-fire red-hot page-turner.	2002-08-23

This is not Kellerman's grand mastrpiece he was aiming for, but still a decent and enjoyable read! The premise is really original and could have been developed better, but hey cut him some slack! Some reviews out and out blasted him!<br />   Somebody that has never tried writing a novel does not know the difficulty in doing such. People that just read for the pleasure of reading is fine, but the creative process is quite a grind!! So I allow a little lee-way when writing a review. It's not as easy as it looks by a long shot!!<br />   Having said that, Kellerman hits and misses with this one. His characterization is first-rate, but the novel drags a little at times. The action is good and the ending comes fast and furious; our senses are almost overloaded with all the info thrown at us.<br />   Kellerman may have been experiencing a tight deadline opr any number of things, but still worth the price of admission. I don't think Jon could write a truly \\"bad book\\" if he tried.<br />   To the skeptics, try writing a novel. Better yet, try to get one published!	2002-08-23

He is a clever and witty narrator that is good at detailing \\"real life\\" accounts.<br />   This guy could be called \\"The Mailman\\" because he delivers. I know, I know it's a cliche but Kellerman is that damn good (sorry HHH)!!! He is very good at describing his characters and  keeping the story flowing at a nice pace. Like his wife, he is just an excellent writer, I know I am laying it on kind of thick, but READ him and u will find out for yourself!!!<br />   As usual his stories carry an underlying socio-logical message. He writes with the precision of a surgeon and is just great at documenting the human condition that is life. His book's are always enjoyable and I am surprised they aren't turned into movies.

He captures the right mood and details rituals in some of the vacationers dreams. ...<br />   I could have rated it a little higher but it does drag at times and u sometimes need to read certain passages twice to fully comprehend.

It was a pretty good characterization about an unstable person and I liked his narrative voice.<br />   However, having just finished Hungry Eyes, his first novel, it wasn't nearly as good. And I am currently reading his second novel, Eyes of Prey, which so far is phenomenal. Born Bad isn't close to either one of these novels, but it is still a decent read.<br />   Hoffman has burst onto the horror scene like a lightning bolt. He is a fresh voice into a genre that has too many stale ones. Although he writes psychological horror and not really horror, he is still redefining the genre. He is just learning his craft and that is scary, because Hungry Eyes was nominated for a Stoker award his first trip out of the gate. This guy is breathing life into the cliched serial killer novel.<br />   I would like to see Hoffman tackle a &quot;real horror novel.&quot; In his hands, he could work some real magic with the horror genre. However, I am just happy he has graced us with his presence. An interesting writer with a definite message to tell.	2002-08-21

Mitchell gets better and better with every novel and she is way ahead of the queen, Rice. She sets the story up, paces it, and makes us identify with her characters. Honestly, I never have been a big vampire fan because most of it is too flowery and wordy. But Mitchell breaks it down and writes in a straight-forward way as not to \\"over-write.\\"<br />   She can write with any of the other splatter-punk's, too; she writes in an orgy of blood and gore. She writes with just a hint of sexuality and sensuality, keeping us wanting more and more.<br />   Her ideas are fresh and very well-thought out and planned. She writes like a bat out of hell and composes her fiction in a literary manner, but not too wordy.<br />   Mitchell is one of the few female writers in the genre that is truly gifted and can deliver chills and shivers down your spine.	2002-08-21

Robert McCammon burst onto the horror scene like a lightning bolt and scared the [heck] out of many jaded horror fans. He was like King and Straub combined. He was a master storyteller and amazed many that read him for the first time. However, when he tried to cross over and write mainstream fiction, he was rejected. So he retired; however rumor is he has been accepted and is on the comeback trail with mainstream fiction. Gone South and Mine are perfect examples he can succeed.<br />   Blue World is short stuff at it's best. McCammon pulls no punches and is quite adept at pulling off some chills and thrills in the short form. Here are some worthy mentions of kudos.<br />   \\"Makeup\\" is about a small-time thief who breaks into a museum and steals the wrong thing. He steals a makeup bag by a B-movie horror actor. His contact refuses to pay anything for it and the hoodlum tries the makeup on, to hilarious results.<br />   \\"I Scream Man\\" is chilling and very good.<br />   \\"Something Passed By\\" is an end of the world type doomsday short that is very entertaining and thought-provoking. It is one of McCammon's best.<br />   \\"Blue World\\", the title, is about 175 pages of detailed description of a priest in distress about his obsession with a porn star. It is a very easy read; entertaining and thought-provoking about the things a priest must go through to test his faith. McCammon must have researched the adult industry becuase it is a very good accounting. This is just a great novella.<br />   And as usual, you will have fun with anything McCammon writes. Let us hope he is coming back to the fold soon.	2002-08-21

The whole premise is okay, but this is a perfect book for people who have trouble sleeping.

This book is just bad and I almost gave it a lower rating, but there are some decent parts.

His father is haunted by this and this young boy encounters other things over this magical summer; a boy with a lisp who throws a 90 mile an hour fastball, a vodoo queen, an alligator that is part myth, part real.<br />   This book changed the way I look at childhood and is a book I want my 3-year old to read one day.

I don't want to give away too much, but this book rocks and deserves some type of award, possibly a Stoker.<br />   Keep 'em coming, Mr Clark!!!	2002-08-20

And that says a mouthful; because this dame can write a yarn. She writes a great vampire novel here and does so much better than Ms.Rice.<br />   This book has it all; sex, violence, gore, romance. What else can a horror fan ask for? Plot synopsis? You got it!!<br />   Amanda, an innocent little thing, goes to work at Candle Bay resort, owned by the Darlings, a vampire clan. Candle Bay is an exclusive resort outside of San Francisco. The Darlings have an on-going feud with The Dante's. And the fun begins.<br />   Thorne outdoes herself with each effort and is quickly becoming one of the best female horror writers published today. Her pacing of a novel is smooth and effortless, her characters are fleshed out, the violence quick and painful to the jugular, and the sex...Well you need to read this novel.<br />   I have yet to read Eternity but it looks fantastic. Her new novel, The Forgotten, to be released in November 2002, also looks awesome.<br />   Tamara, please, please, keep 'em coming!!!	2002-08-20

Most of Clark's novels released through Leisure wre written in the mid 90's and this is easily his \\"worst\\" of the five. The only novels I haven't read are Vampyhric and Darker, both of which look awesome!<BR>   <BR>    The plot centers around parents going crazy over night and out for the blood of their offspring. Think of an English Night of the Living Dead; just a horrible premise, but Clark turns it into a \\"decent\\" novel, which for him is subpar. This guy is the next Clive Barker of England.<br />   Actually, the plot is a little deeper than I mentioned, but it is pretty Jungian (he was a thinker like Freud). The novel is good, but not Clark's best. Clark is so talented he was able to save this from being trash, but not his best.<br />   Clark's writing is clear, crisp, and chilling. He writes with the power to thrill and chill, to shock and rock, to frighten and make your stomach tighten. He is a wordsmith of the highest order and he is one of the new king's of horror. <br />   Like I said, Leisure has found another great young voice in the horror field.	2002-08-20

Clegg is a great writer and knows how to craft a story and deliver the usual chills and thrills. He is also adept at setting atmosphere and does this well in this particular book. Not much blood and gore here; it is much more subtle. But don't confuse subtle with complex; this is a quick fun read.<br />   However, like I mentioned before he is falling in love with ghost stories and haunted houses. The gore and violence factor that were found in abundance in his early work is not found here, not that it detracts from the story. I think he is just evolving as a writer and he no longer feels he needs the splatter.<br />   Final thoughts; a good novel with spooky atmosphere and chills and thrills, but not one of his better books by a long shot.	2002-08-19

A decent effort by a writer who has been around for a while. Gresham has been a long-time writer for the Pinnacle Horror line and shows what he can do with a vampire tale in the deep south. He does not make it hard to read; the language is easy to understand and he has a natural storyteller's gift for gab.<BR>   <BR>   It is a little slow at times, but the story is still very easy to follow. The Trackers date back to the Civil War and the old southern mansion is about to be torn down, letting loose an ancient evil. Not really that original of a concept, but Gresham does a decent job with it.<BR>   <BR>   Franklin is an original character as a homosexual in the family that is an outcast. He is a natural as a vampire and makes for a wonderful \\"bad guy.\\" However, the ending is one I never would have guessed from this frightful character.<br />   This was one of the first books I have read from Gresham. Based on this interesting tale, I will search out more, even after his Dark Magic, which was disappointing.<br />   Mr Gresham, you have a gift as a storyteller and I am sorry to only give a 3 for this effort, but it just didn't strike me as deserving more. However, I will continue to read your work and hope to see future novels.	2002-08-19

A very good novel, but just that. <br />   Good.<br />   I was expecting more from Clegg. And I don't know how to quantify that. More. The book was ok, but it seemed to bog down at times. It didn't move as smoothly as some of his other novels.<br />   Still anything he writes is better than a lot of other stuff passing as horror fiction these days.

This novel will make you afraid to walk in the rain or you may turn into a raving, blood-thirsty lunatic!! Laymon takes a silly concept and turns it into a fairly interesting read. He does a great job of setting the story up, but his characters are not fleshed out like in other novels. <BR>   <BR>   However, he does a great job of describing the action and the scene in the restaurant is classic Laymon. It is something \\"Laymon-ite's\\" will instantly recognize as classic, vintage Laymon. The survivors of the black rain battle the blood-thirsty rain soaked (undead?)!!<BR>   <BR>   Some of the survivors are then forced to go to the house of a vodoo priest to stop the rain and the ending is Laymon at his best. He doesn't pull any punches and this book reads like a screenplay for a George Romero film. It should be developed into a B-movie film, maybe straight to video?<br />   An enjoyable read and solid outing from the late, great Dick Laymon.	2002-08-19

His stories are not traditional zombies, vampires, werewolves. etc. He is the new voice in horror with some awesome ideas and plots; simply put he is the new King.<br />   He doesn't string together a plot to unleash gore and violence on you. His plot's are well-thought out, well researched, and thought-provoking. Some say he is too intellectual in his recent work, but he has simply evolved. This is a fine example of his early stuff and clearly shows he is no flash in the pan.<br />   This novel is excellent; he knows how to scare and he knows how to flesh out his main characters. Clegg knows how to get under our skin and pulls no punches in doing so. He is a modern master of horror.	2002-08-19

I won't go that far, because it takes a lot to be able to write a good story; one that is believeable and engaging. However, since we are talking about horror, toss out the believeability factor. This story wasn't even engaging enough to keep my attention for long, although I did finish it. Any time you spend money on a book, you have a duty to finish it.<BR>   <BR>   This was like going to the dentist, though. It was literally like pulling teeth to finish this zombie tale about the living dead in  downtown Dallas.<BR>   <BR>   Even more surprising was that the folks at Dell Abyss would publish this. The Abyss line put out some good little horror novels, like the Stephen King blurb said. However, this wasn't one of them.<br />   If you want to read a DECENT novel from Dee, try SUCCUMB. It's not Shakespeare and the premise is not new, but Dee writes a good little yarn about being careful for what you wish for. It's light year's better than this novel.	2002-08-19

He has written a powerful story about three kids who experience a coming of age in Grandville, USA. This is on par with King's \\"Stand By Me\\" and McCammon's \\"Boy's Life\\" with a supernatural twist. <br />   This is a masterpiece and Laymon's shining moment as a writer. It was so good it won the prestigious Bram Stoker Award. It was great to see Laymon get recognized for this beautiful story. It would be even better to see Laymon awarded some type of Lifetime Achievement Award by the Horror Writers Association or International Horror Guild. This man deserves that honor.<br />   The story takes place all in one fun-filled summer day. The characters are real, believeable, and put in danger by Laymon (what else?). This is an action-packed novel and is more suspenseful until the last 100 pages or so, when the REAL FUN begins to take place.<br />   If you have never read Laymon, this is a great book to start with. It is gory and filled with sex, so BEWARE. The plot is engaging and very well-written, like most of Laymon's work. However, if ou start with this tale by Laymon, you may be let down in the future since this is his best work. He is just a master at what he does (did).<br />   5-Stars!!	2002-08-19

As a soon to be novelist, I don't give bad reviews often, because I know how hard it is to write a good story. Having said that, this tale is a disappointment. I won't just slam it, I will try and offer some constructive criticism.<BR>   <BR>   Gresham starts out good with the opening, but the story bogs down at times. It just seems like a tedious read, however I did finish it. Any time I spend hard earned cash, I will definitely finish the book. Gresham wrote a good book in In the Blood, a novel that moves along smoothly.<br />   However, Dark Magic does not read as easily. I don't know why and I can't put my finger on it, but it just becomes tedious. There are some redeeming qualities; his descriptive account about life in small-town Alabama, the sisters are actually fleshed out quite well and interesting. The Terror, the main part of the book, is just not fully realized, I think.<br />   Mr Gresham, I hope this is helpful to you and I will continue to read your work. I believe any author that is published deserve's a chance, except maybe Ron Dee. Your book, In the Blood, was quite good, although I only gave it a 3-star. You have a great storyteller's voice in common everyday language. You don't over-write, which is probably the best compliment I could give u.	2002-08-19

A writer is usually better at one or the other, but Clegg knows how to scare in either form.<br />   The collection are nightmares by a boy who has been kidnapped by some truly unsavory characters. The first is &quot;Underworld&quot; and starts off with a bang. This is one creepy and scary story; take my word for it. You will break out in goosebumps.<br />   Other stories of note: &quot;The Rendering Man&quot; and possibly the best stolry of the bunch, &quot;I am infinite:I contain multitudes.&quot;  The third story will surprise and shock you. <br />   Quite simply, &quot;Clegg is a weaver of nightmares,&quot; as one reviewer said of him years ago about his debut, Goat Dance.	2002-08-19

Clark is the latest in a long line of brilliant english horror writers. James Herbert, Clive Barker, and now Mr Clark has made it to the US of A.<BR>   <BR>   Clark's style is a cross between Herbert and Barker. Herbert's style is darker and not as violent as Barker's early books. Barker was an in your face, no holds barred attack on the senses. Clark is somewhere in between the two; although he is darker than Herbert.<br />   This novel is a parent's worse nightmare. The couple moves to an english village by the seaside and the town is full of mysterious going-ons. I don't want to give away too much, but this novel is GREAT!<br />   People that like happy endings and light horror fare need to take note: DO NOT READ THIS NOVEL!!

This is not Shakespeare, not Faulkner, not even King on a bad day. However, Dee tells a decent tale about a man having an affair and his life turned into a living nightmare.<br />  Martin used to be a free spirit.<br />  He used to be a musician.<br />  Now he's married with children. Kind of like Al Bundy, except Martin is in corporate America. That is who I kept picturing while reading this book. Al Bundy. Anyway, Martin meets a ...woman in a bar when his wife is away on a business trip. And then his life turns into a nightmare. Think of a supernatural version of fatal attraction. I won't say any more, because to do so would give away too much.<br />  Dee does a good job of characterization in this book. It is light years better than Dusk, a big disappointment. We come to like Martin and feel for him since he is trapped in the rat race; car payment, a mortgage, etc. The one person who could turn this into a GREAT novel would be Bentley Little. In his hands, this would be a Stoker Award winner.<br />  However, Dee does a reputable job in this be-careful-what-you-wish-for tale.	2002-08-19

This is an interesting concept that Laymon uses to the max!<br />   I loved this novel and thought Laymon did a great job pacing the story and capturing the idiosyncracies of small-town life for this plain-jane librarian. The plot centers around a young librarian who gets messages to do bizarre things for a certain amount of money which keeps increasing with each increasingly dangerous stunt.<br />   The master of games or &quot;MOG&quot; is a weird character who gets off getting the librarian to do these acts, hint one is really creepy like sleeping in a coffin almost naked for an obscene amount of money. This is very well-thought out and extremely well-written literary story by the master of horror.<br />   Laymon creates a spooky atmosphere with this book and does a great job with this psychological horror novel. It moves along at a brisk pace and never gets bogged down, like SOME of Laymon's novels. <br />   Just shy of a 5-star rating, but an awesome piece of fiction.	2002-08-19

Laymon decideds to tackle the issue on vampires and like The Stake writes an interesting read. <br />   His plot is centered around Sam, a 26-year old man, who is visited by former lover, Cat. She rekindles his passion for her and stirs up old memories. <br />   She tells him she wants to kill Elliot and needs his help. Elliot is a vampire, according to Cat, and visits her almost nightly, draining her. Sam agrees and they set up a scenario where Sam jumps out of the closet, startling Elliot. Sam kills the vampire in typical Laymon fashion with plenty of gore and violence.<br />   The rest of the novel details the duo's escapades as they try to get rid of the vampire's body. This straight-forward and entertaining read is everything Laymon fans love. <br />   However, it does get bogged down and is slow at times. Not Laymon's best, not his worst. The duo encounter some pretty ridiculous people along the way and is pretty far-fetched. <br />   As a reviewer wrote, you'll have fun with anything Laymon writes. So buy the book and don't expect too much, just enjoy the thrills and chills.	2002-08-19

He does not conform to what is socially acceptable and is a brilliant storyteller, but says it much more concise than \\"the grand master King.\\"<br />   Laymon piles on the violence and sex in his novels and he shows why he is a hit overseas. Overseas people have less inhibitions with sex and violence, they live a much \\"freer\\" society when it comes to these two things. It isn't quite as taboo. He writes in an easy to understand style and is straight-forward with his prose. <BR>   <BR>   Having said that, he is making quite an impression under Leisure Horror, who has re-published a lot of his works in Stake, In the Dark, Island, Among the Missing, etc. In death, he is experiencing his greatest success and popularity in the United States.<br />   The plot involves a group of people stranded on an island when a psycho blows up their boat. Let the good times roll! Plot twists and turns abound with almost every chapter. Oh yeah, the narrator is a ...boyfriend of one of the girls (typical Laymon)and the narration moves along smoothly, told in a journal style notebook.<br />   The book is long, over 500 pages, but it reads like it's only 300 or so. It is a classic \\"summer beach read\\" and can be finished within a couple sittings.<br />   ... Leisure plans on releasing a \\"new\\" Laymon every six months.	2002-08-19

Greg Tomasov wins the California lottery and moves his family back home to a samll town in Arizona. Little describes southwestern life in great detail and adds a little russian history to the mix.<BR>   The spirits in the bathhouse are somewhat underdone, but Greg's possession is entirely predictable; however you never can tell with Little.

The beginning was great and probably let down some fans, because the ending doesn't live up to the start of the book.<BR> <br />Miles character wasn't fleshed out all that well, although his father was. If Little has a flaw, the key character might be it. However in the Store, his main character was awesome, same with the Association, which is his best work, I think.<BR> <br />The Walking is about a story of Witches who die after a flood leaves them buried alive under a lake, where years later dead start to walk to. Miles goes after his father with his ex-wife and fellow PI. They confront the evil and it does kind of leave us hanging, but this is an enjoyable ride.	2002-08-16
