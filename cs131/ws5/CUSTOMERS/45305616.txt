Was suprised at the love of Kirk's life being of Klingon/Romulan heritage concidering his history with them. I guess it show's even Kirk's never to old to chnge for the better,huh?<br /><br /> I couldn't help saying \\"Oh, that's cold!\\" with the way it end's (in being a cliff hanger). Look forward to finding the next book in this story.	2005-06-07
