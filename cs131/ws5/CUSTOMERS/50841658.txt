I cannot possibly recommend this novel highly enough!  Kingsley's work reminds us again what it is to be human. <br /> <br />On the morning of 9/11 I, like the rest of the country, sat is absolute horror and shock, watching the events in NY unfold on television.  I thought instantly of a dear friend who daily stopped at one of the towers for coffee and a bagel before taking the train into the city.  Where was my dear friend that day?  As the towers fell, I feared he was somewhere at the bottom of that smoking pile of rubble and I wouldn't get the chance to tell him one more time how very treasured his friendship is to me and how dearly I love him. <br /> <br />The emotions of the women in this novel were so true to what I experienced for 3 days until I finally got a phone line into Brooklyn to check on my friend and heard his voice on the other end, that I cried through most of this book.  I could relate to the fear of the unknown and how essential prayer and my faith was to me then and continues to be today.  Thankfully my dear friend was alive and well, but for so many whose story had a different ending, the pain continues.   <br /> <br />This novel reminds us that, regardless of ethnicity or color of skin, we are all of one race -- human -- and we all bleed, laugh, cry, and love.  What a spectacular novel this one is!	2005-04-14

I then offered my book as a loaner.  Several students took me up on the offer (1 got the book and the rest are on the waiting list.) <br /> <br />  This story explores the fear and yes, excitement, of pregnancy from the male teen perspective which is refreshing.  I felt the book could have used more tension, but the message itself was powerful enough and the story written well enough to sustain interest.   <br /> <br />If you are a pregnant teen or KNOW a pregnant teen, this is a must-read book.  I almost hope my \\"loaner\\" copy of the book doesn't come back to me.  That would mean one of my students loved it enough to keep it and read it again.	2005-02-05

Doesn't there?<br />This is a multi-generational saga of 4 sisters and the things in life that drive them, both to greatness and to great despair.  And at the root of all the secrets and lies is one horrible secret that could destroy the fragile bond that holds this troubled family together.  Sins of the heart.  Sins of the mind.  Sins of the body.  Sins of the family.  There simply aren't enough Hail Mary's to be said to set things right in the Piper family.<br />From disowned Materia and her Gaelic husband James come the disillusionment, despair, depression, and deeply rooted mental illness that is a hill too steep to climb.  Then, there is Kathleen, the daughter gifted with the voice of angels.  Sadly, Kathleen's heart isn't as pure as her voice and so begins the sisters' stories.  Sent to New York to study voice with a highly regarded teacher, Kathleen finds that life with a distant relative has it's advantages - and prices too high to pay for her actions.<br />Mercedes is, perhaps, the one sister who is truly pure of heart and mind, but seems unable, through no fault of her own, to focus and find the place she is most meant to be.  Virtually invisible, although always striving to be seen as \\"the good sister\\", Mercedes becomes a slave to her family, constantly striving for their acceptance, never realizing that the only acceptance she truly needs in this life is her own.  Regrets and lost hopes and dreams cloud Mercedes' daily activities, holding her back like quicksand from the greatness she was intended for.<br />Frances, deeply troubled victim of incest, is perhaps the most perplexing and complex of the characters in this unforgettable novel.  Frances lives her life in toughness, that hard outer shell protecting the soft, vulnerability that lies deep in her heart.  She lives a life of lies and deception, misleading both herself and those who could most help her succeed in life.  She simply cannot accept the truth - and the truth could either kill her or set her heart free.<br />Then comes Lily, of unknown parentage.  This sweet, unassuming character struggles with a physical handicap while internally a storm brews that no one can see.  A victim of Frances and her lies - does she even realize the lies aren't the truth? - Lily struggles to find her place in the Piper family.<br />Through all the heartbreak, mental illness, incest, mental, emotional and physical violence, and heartbreaking despair, this family gets to the reader.  Speaks to you in their own individual voices.  Begs for forgiveness and understanding.  A second chance.  Comfort and warmth.  A soft place to fall.  Love and acceptance for who they truly are.<br />This unforgettable novel races to its loop-the-loop conclusion, leaving the reader gasping for breath, drained physically and emotionally, and needing to sit down a while and get reoriented.  There are simply not enough Hail Mary's to save this family from self-destruction.  But this is one of the rare literary masterpieces that almost REQUIRES a re-read, just to find all the essential details you may have missed the first time around.  Simply spectacular and a highly recommended keeper.	2002-02-17

The characters' motives for marriage were shallow at best and a man with money would surely have been more cautious about marriage (even in name only) to a woman he didn't know.  And a woman responsible for two small children would surely be more cautious about the man she proposes marriage to.<br />The ending left something to be desired and I have to admit I felt cheated.  Instead of the anticipated showdown between the heroine and her good-for-nothing brother-in-law over the two children in the story, the demise of the brother-in-law struck me as a little too convenient.

Not only do the characters not particularly endear themselves  to the reader, they &quot;fall in love&quot; much too easily, and from  there, the story becomes so painfully predictable that this novel quickly  goes from being a so-so paperweight to a wallbanger and doorstop.  What a  good romance needs is conflict - and there is no real conflict between  Janice and White Shield, making their story flat and uninteresting.<br />What  the &quot;Savage&quot; series needs is either to die off quietly or some  new, fresh ideas.

But more bad news comes along with the cruel Bohun's arrival.   Rafe De Montford has been sent to take Adele to the man the King has  selected as her husband.
