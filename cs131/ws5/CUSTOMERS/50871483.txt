I vaguely remember hearing about this chick who got herself into debt and came up with the brilliant idea of asking people for money to help her pay off her credit card debt.  When I saw this book in my store ( ...), I immediately picked it up and started reading it on my break.  I got so engrossed with Karyn's story that I found myself almost 200 pages into it.  <br />Her story reads like it's fiction and it's funny funny funny!  She takes us from the beginning when she moves to NYC to her complete and utter downfall.  I loved how she put copies of her CC statements so we could see how foolish her spending really was.  And the way she justified some of those purchases had me in stitches. <br />This is a great book to give to anyone who's going away to college about the evils of debt.  Learn from Karyn's mistakes....and check out her website:  [...] <br />It still has money saving tips and a monthly update on her life.<br />Ohh, BTW, ..., I got a discount on your book, Karyn :)	2003-09-05

I love being a fast reader.  I am not going to give a plot synopsis, since the editorial reviews will be doing that and I don't want to spoil it for anyone who is still reading :)<br />My thoughts, impressions, and whatnot:<br />*I did think this one took a little bit longer to suck me into it, and I kept thinking, \\"why is Harry so whiny\\"<BR>*New characters are a trip, especially Dolores Umbridge, who eveyone will love to hate.<BR>*We find out what The order of the Phoenix is<BR>*The ending, again, is killer!!  Will leave you wanting the next installment<BR>*Harry is, indeed, growing up<BR>*As Rowling continues with the series, she is making the level of the books increase as well.  This one really should be classifed as young adult.  There are a couple of things in there that I felt were older material and not for 7-9 year olds.<BR>*New prefects<BR>*New mystical creatures (!)<BR>*OWLS - wizard testing abound<br />I think that's it!  But really, outstanding once the story got going!  Harry's world is mystical and magical and one we all wish we could see, JK Rowling lets us do just that thru her excellent story-telling.<br />Enjoy!	2003-06-24

This is what makes it so scary.  I couldn't put this book down once I picked it up.  I also loved the fact that it's set locally (for me anyway).<br />I can't wait to see what else Mr. Erlick comes up with for his next novel.<br />Trust me!  Buy this book.

I was pleasantly surprised to see it set in Clanton, MS where 'Time to Kill' was set and happily surprised to see the character of Harry Rex brought back. I was disappointed that Grisham made no mention of Jake from 'Time to Kill' and hugely disappointed in the characters and plot of this novel. The story line is very familiar. In fact, I'd skip this one and read, 'A Simple Plan' by Scott Smith instead. It's better written than the 'Summons'. Also, I recommend Brad Meltzer's 'The Millionaires' as an alternative with a similiar plot as well. <br />This book just didn't seem to go anywhere and the ending....well, the ending. It just ended. Just like that.<br />Thanks for reading!<br />~Pandora	2002-02-22

I was very excited to see that one of my favorite authors had a new book released.  My only problem is that I devoured this book in 1 day and now I have to wait at least a year until his next one.  BOO HOO!<br />Meltzer's latest has 2 brothers trying to steal 3 million dollars from the highly exclusive bank they work in.  It seems like a fool proof plan.  Play a dead guy and collect $3 million.  The only problem is that someone else set it up and wants in on it when he discovers that the brothers took his con.  My favorite part has to be when the 3 of them are trying to figure out where to wire the money to.  The Caymans?  Nah, everyone sends it there ever since Grisham popularized it in 'The Firm'.  <br />All in all, a great romp, yes romp, of a book!  It's a quick and easy read.  Meltzer really sucks you in with his characters.  I hope he brings back one of the minor ones, Joey, a private investigator, in another book. His use of location is fantastic.  You really get a great sense of being in Disney and when you do go there, I know I'll be watching Snow White to see where she goes :)<br />Buy this book, you won't regret it!<br />Thanks for reading!<BR>~Pandora	2002-01-15

The idea of making a soundtrack for you life intrigued me.  We meet Helena Nicholls, a British DJ with the coveted morning show, but her show is unlike others.  She would play requests, but only after the person would tell the entire listening audience why the song was so important to them, how they were feeling when they heard it, what they were wearing and so on.  The novel moves between the present and the past, so we get to relive Helena's life with her.  Each chapter is titled with a song and it truly is the soundtrack of her life, which has hit rock bottom.  She has a horrific accident which leaves her scarred and missing an eye.  She is fired from her morning slot and offered a graveyard shift.  As she begins to heal physically, Helena begins to form the Plan.  She will write her autobiography, beginning with her childhood and end it with her first day back at the radio station, playing her soundtrack and then ending it all.  <br />The author sucks you into Helena's world effortlessly and you really want to know what will happen to her.  Helena starts with her upbringing in England, meeting her best friend, Sam, who has a tragic end, to moving to the States and joining a rock band. <br />It really is nicely done and I will be watching this author to see what else she does.<br />Thanks for reading!<BR>~pandora	2001-11-09

The reason being is that I knew that I would want to devour it in one sitting, which I did not have time to do.  Finally, I just gave in and picked it up.  This was more like a DT preview than a sequel to the Talisman, but it works.  I was a little put off by the narration of the novel, but once you get used to that, the book reads fairly easy.  Once again, we have our hero, Jack, now a retired LA homicide detective, living in the midwest.  He gets sucked into another homicide case, particularly nasty 'cause the killer has fashioned himself after Albert Fish, a child serial killer.  You find out the killer's identity fairly quickly, but the story is not about the killer, in a way.  It's about the black house and evilness. All in all, a good read!<br />Thanks for reading!<BR>~Pandora	2001-11-09

Once again, our heroine is back, fighting internal demons as well as nasty seriel killers.  The characters here are more developed than in 'Perfect Evil' and you can really feel the anguish that Maggie is going through.  The reunion with Nick Morelli is nicely done and not sappy at all.

This rare reading, recorded in England, I believe in 1997, is a wonderful find for us Americans.  Previously published in the very rare 'Six Stories', it's now available for the mainstream.  The story itself has to do with a retelling of LT's theory of pets and why you should never buy a pet for another person, in the retelling we come to find out the LT's wife has left him and this event has started the whole theory process.  Of course, this being a SK story, nothing is ever what it seems on the surface.  My only complaint with this version is that it leaves off the interview with SK that is available on the British version.  <br />Thanks for reading!<br />~Pandora	2001-08-02

Mr. Patterson, whose books I normally LOVE, has tried to write a romance novel a la Nicholas Sparks.  The book goes back and forth between Katie (present time) and Suzanne's diary for Nicholas, whom we find out is Katie's boyfriend's wife and Nicholas is their son.  Oh the angst, oh the unhappiness.  Is it a tragic love story? Yes.  Is there a happy ending?  You'll have to read it to find out, however, I'd wait for the paperback or even just borrow it from the library.  Nicholas Sparks fans may love this book, but that's iffy 'cause I liked Sparks first two novels and this is not up to par with those.  <br />I can respect Mr. Patterson for trying something new, but give it up!

There weren't any parts that I truly laughed out loud, maybe a giggle, but not a true belly laugh with tears streaming down my face that Evanovich usually brings.  Again, the usual characters are all accounted for, with Steph's perfect sister brought back home, having been dumped by her husband for the babysitter.

The first full length novel King has produced since his horrific 1999 accident, it is reminscent of King novels written long ago.  We first meet four men, who all grew up together in the town of Derry.  These men did a brave thing when they were children and saved a mentally challenged boy from the older kids.  They become fast friends with Duddits (Douglas) and include him into their circle.  Flash forward to the present where the men are getting ready to go on their annual hunting trip.  It is in the woods that things go dicey, starting with an unexpected guest to an all out military quarentine.  I am pacing myself with this one trying to make it last.  I feel it is worth it :)  King truly can take simple things and make them the most terrifying.

Having read 'The Muse' by this author and loved it, I was really excited to find out that he has written a vampire novel, since that is my favorite genre.  We meet Cassandra Hall, a vampire who has been outcast.  The book goes back and forth pre-vampire and post vampire to really give you a feel for this character.  The world Cecilione creates is uhm, highly erotic, in that his characters participate in various bondage and S &amp; M games, as his vampires are no longer able to feel in the normal way, each act must be taken to an extreme for them to be able to feel anything.  We get a glimpse into the world of these vamps and what makes them tick, we also get some different myths dispelled, such as the daylight being able to kill these vampires.  The ending of the book is excellent, not what I expected, but leads us to believe that he may bring back some of these characters for a different book.  At least I hope so :)<br />All in all- a great read!<br />Thanks for reading **Pandora	2000-11-22

What  she doesn't count on is falling in love with one Richard Granville, not  realizing he is the one.  Sparks certainly fly with these two.  Now, the  big question is will Sharon change the course of history and present  Richard with the proof he has looked for, or will she follow her heart?  A  most satisfying romantic what-if, the ending doesn't disappoint.  <br />Thank  you for reading my review :)<br />**Pandora	2000-09-06

I picked up this book because I liked the cover, reading the back only enticed me more.  I finished this book in a day, it was so fast-paced.  Our  heroine of the story is Bridgett Logan, former junkie, now a private  investigator.  Her promise to a friend ten years ago is what brings her  former life and present life crashing together.  You have to admire  Bridgett, she is ballsy and tough, true friend, and you can totally depend  on her.  This loyalty is what send Bridgett spiralling down into that world  again.  Vince Lark shows up on Lisa's doorstep, wanting the money she owes  him for her drugs, ten years ago.  He threatens her and scares her.  Lisa  goes to Bridgett and asks her to help her kill Vince.  Bridgett comes up  with a much better plan of scaring the crap out of him.  Then Vince turns  up dead anyway, and Lisa is charged with the crime of murder.  These turn  of events is what forces Bridgett to go deep undercover to find out what  really happened and find the true killer in time to clear up Lisa's name.   You are easily sucked into this world of drugs and violence and you find  yourself rooting for Bridgett to find out the truth.

It is not the face paced novel like, 'Red Dragon' and  'Silence of the Lambs'.  Instead, Mr Harris gives us a lesson in Italian  history and describes with great detail the places that Hannibal has  visited.  Clarice Starling also is in this novel, having fallen on hard  times, her rising star, now fallen.  Suspended from the FBI, she is not the  first on the scene when we find out who Lecter's identity is.  Also, the  main villian of this novel is not Lecter, but Mason Verger, a man who is  permanently disfigured by Lecter.  He now swears revenge on Hannibal, and  means to take it by training pigs to eat him from the feet up.  The ending  of the book is the most unbelievable with Clarice and Hannibal teaming up.   I was truly disappointed by the ending.  Don't waste your time, re-read  'Lambs' or 'Red Dragon'<br />Thanks for reading!<br />**Pandora	2000-09-01

The new novel by Dean Koontz is typical fare for Koontz, it features a young woman named Martie Rhodes who gets sucked into a psychological  nightmare.  She is trying to help her friend overcome her fear of  agoraphobia and ends up with a rare case of fear of oneself.  Her fear  confuses her husband, Dusty.  This book is one roller-coaster of a ride.   It does take a while to get the main plot to reveal itself and once it  does, WOW!  Koontz always has an ending that makes you think, well at least  it makes me think, that his plots really could happen and that is what  makes it scary.

Although Katie denies any involvement with the infant, including she may  have given birth to it, circumstantial evidence leads to her arrest.  Enter  Ellie Hathaway, fresh from a courtroom victory and sickened by the  &quot;wheels of justice&quot;, Ellie leaps at the chance to visit her  great-aunt's home in Paradise, PA.  What she doesn't count on is getting  involved with another courtroom battle so soon, but at the pleading of her  aunt, she takes on the case of Katie Fisher.  Ellie soon learns that trying  to find out the truth from these 'plain' folks is more trying than  expected.  She immerses herself into Katie's world and understands more and  more what it means to be 'plain'.  As this story reaches the heart  wrenching finale, one will be reminded of another book, the endings are  similar, but this truly stands on its own as a powerful reminder of life,  faith, and love.	2000-08-16

Fresh off the success of her last novel, Mistaken  Identity, Scottoline serves up a heck of a legal thriller.  The book starts  out with a bang.  Attorney Jack Newlin arrives home to find his wife,  Honor, dead on the floor.  Stabbed.  He then decides to make it looks like  he has committed the crime, because he is convinced he knows who really did  it and is committed to protecting that person.  After staging the crime  scene to implicate himself, Jack then calls the police--and also proceeds  to hire an inexperienced lawyer, Mary DiNunzio, of the Philadelphia firm of  Rosato &amp; Associates.   This turns out to be a huge mistake for Jack,  because although Mary is inexperienced in murder trials, she has passion  and heart.

We follow the tale  of Sayuri beginning at age 9 when she is sent to live with a 'geisha'  family.  She then begins the vigorous training involved in becoming a  geisha, learning many arts like dancing, music, the art of conversation,  culture and much more.

I think people are rediscovering this book because 3 of the 4 stories in it have been made into movies.  The first one, 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' is probably one of the finest adaptations of a book I  have ever seen, however since this is a book review and not a movie review,  let me get back on track.  <br />'Shawshank' is about a man accused of  murdering his wife and her lover and his subsequent jail sentence in the  1930s.  Thru his jail sentence we get to know Andy thru the eyes of Red,  the narrator.  We learn all about the horrors of prison, the sisters, the  unjustice, the unfairness of things.  This one is probably my favorite of  the four.<br />'The Body' is better know as the movie 'Stand by Me', a tale of  4 boys, some from the wrong side of the tracks, some not, but all the  closest of friends.  This is their tale, the adventure of a lifetime as  they trek out into the woods to see a dead body.  <br />'Apt Pupil' is the  most horrifying of the four.  The story of Todd Bowman who just happens to  discover a Nazi war criminal living in his neighborhood.  Their twisted  relationship gets more terrifying by each page.<br />And finally, 'The  Breathing Method'...this one starts out in that funny little club in NYC  run by Stevens.  The Christmas tale told that year is about a pregnant  mother that comes to a most gruesome end.<br />These short little synopsis do  nothing to the scope of the stories.  Do yourself a favor and read them  all.  They are like little gems waiting to be discovered!<br />**Pandora	2000-08-01

I believe that this is the first comtempory romance novel that Garwood has written.  The premise is something right up my alley.

Right as he  is ready to get up and call it a day, a man steps into the confessional     &quot;Bless me father, for I will sin, I'm a heartbreaker&quot;    Not only  does this heartbreaker give the name of the victim he will murder next, he  implores the priest to involve his best friend, Nick Buchanan from the F B  I.  And the victim...the priests beloved sister.    So imagine my  disappointment when I actually finished Heartbreaker and it is more like a  Hannibal lite novel.  The characters fall in love with each other just a  little too quickly for my tastes, but I should have know being the writer  is a romance novelist and not a horror writer.

She is called back into the game by Travis, her  sometime lover and boss of the investigative company who has hired her.   She is given a second chance with Travis.  He wants her to protect a  television anchor who is being stalked.  Abby then goes undercover to get  close to the stalker by moving in next door to him.

Fast paced, full of action, as I was reading it I could see it as a movie and it would be a kicking movie too!  It did remind me of the  movie, &quot;Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; slightly.  Cassidy Black is our  heroine and she is currently on parole.  She ends up being lured back into  business by an old accomplice who swears it's an easy target.  Cassie ends  up back in Vegas where her last job went bad; it ended up with her lover  being thrown out a window on the top floor of the Cleopatra hotel.  The new  job takes her back to that scene.  The job goes well, but the mark has too  much money, about 2 million more than expected.  From there this novel is  on a roller coaster.  Just try to hang on to the end, it's a fantastic  ride!	2000-05-01

This modern twist on a classic tale is fabulous.  ...Never Dream tells the story of 2 vampires and the mortal they get involved.  It does poke fun at Anne  Rice's novels in a good way such as one vampire insisting to the other that  he read Interview with the Vampire to see why mortals would crave  immortality and also read about the parts she got right and what she got  wrong.  The story opens with the Making of Arthur, a knight from France.   It continues to the present where we find Arthur, Jennings, and Terry (the  mortal) trying to save The Book from falling into the wrong vampire hands.   This book left me wanting more...and I hope Scott continues the adventures  of these vampires in America.	2000-04-29

It relates the same events of Ender's Game, but from the point of view of Bean. Ender's Shadow begins when Bean is four years old and barely surviving on the street. It tell of  his struggle to survive and then his triumph in being accepted to Battle  School. This novel has some new surprises in it. Surprises that I thought  were unbelieveable. The book itself is a good read, however, it is not as  good as Ender's Game. Some of the revelations are just too much in the  sense that you almost feel contempt for Ender and shout to yourself,  &quot;Why doesn't he see this? Why is he letting himself be manipulated by  Bean?&quot;. At least I did! I just did not accept or want to accept what  Card was telling us about Bean. I have been looking forward to this novel  for months and I can tell you that I was disappointed! The concept was so  great, but I think that Card fell a little short on Ender's Shadow.	1999-12-14

It also happened to have a blurb by my favorite author, Stephen King, across the front and I quote, &quot;She is better than Palmer, better than Cook...yes,  even better than Crichton.&quot; That's a pretty high recommendation, so  those 2 factors encouraged me to read this book and boy, does it live up to  the potential! Emma Watson, a brilliant research physician, has been  training for the mission of a lifetime: studying life in outer space.  Emma's ex-husband, Jack McCallum, has also shared her dream of space  travel, but a unforeseen medical condition leaves him grounded and very  bitter. He must watch Emma take the chance of a lifetime and watch her go  into space without him.  Once Emma reaches the space station, however,  things begin to go wrong. An experiment runs deadly, stranding Emma aboard  the station with no way to get home without threatening the Earth's  population. The rescue attempts have all but failed, and one by one the  astronants are dying...what happens next will amaze you! This is a fabulous  read, nice and easy, but yet, keeps you on the edge of your seat. After  reading Gravity, I went back and read Tess Gerritsen's other books.

I was eagarly awaiting the arrival of A Walk to Remember, having devoured Mr. Spark's previous two works. I did read this all in one sitting, thinking that this had to get better. Unfortunately, it didn't. The story seemed to sappy and  sugary sweet, and did not ring true. The plot was entirely too predictable,  especially if I can figure it out. The characters were stereotypical and  shallow. It just seemed like Mr. Sparks was trying too hard this time. In  1958, 17 year old Landon Carter is just trying to get by. His father is a  US Congressman who has high hopes for his son. Landon's friends are the  wrong side of the tracks crowd who don't understand when he befriends Jamie  Sullivan, a girl from his drama class who carries a bible wherever she goes  and is the minister's daughter. Landon's senior class is responsible for  putting on the Christmas play this year and Jamie convinces Landon to take  the lead role to make the play special, for she is to play the lead  opposite him. What then happens is of course the obvious, they fall in  love, and of course, the obvious, Jamie has a secret, that when revealed  will change the course of Landon's life forever. I urge you to read Mr.  Sparks' other 2 books, The Notebook, and Message in a Bottle instead. These  two were wonderful books, probably the only books that I have ever cried  at.	1999-12-09

I've said this before and I'll say it again, I don't usually read romances. But Terri's actually have a great plot and character development.  I actually cared about these characters and wanted to see how they end up.  Ok, now that I've got that off my chest, on to the review! Douglas  MacKendimen, son of Maggie and Alex (from Terri's first book) is visiting  Scotland for a family reunion. His parents have always told him the stories  of when they went back in time and fell in love, but Doug always thought  they were just stories until he finds himself in the same place about 20  years after his folks had been there. In the past, Doug meets Caitlin  McInnis, literally the woman in his dreams. She's a healer, an actual one,  as opposed to Doug who is a doctor. In the past, Doug finds his destiny.  The only question is does he return a better person and leave the woman he  loves behind or does he give up everything for Caitlin?	1999-12-07

In the tradition of Anne Rice, it gives us a rich historical account of the werewolf. It starts in the present with a triple murder. Alexander  Devoncroix and his son, Nicholas, arrive on the scene, aware that the three  murdered were their own kind. Nicholas jumps to the conclusion that a human  did the crime and is outraged and astonished that a human could best 3  werewolves. His father tells him that it could not possibly be a true  human, but a hybrid. A hybrid that he knows personally. Thus begins the  real story. The story of Alexander, a werewolf, and Tessa LeGuerre, a  human. Back in the 1890s, it seems, Alexander falls in love with Tessa  after she tries to murder him. He finds her completely charming and she  finds him to be the most incredible being she has ever met. Alexander  brings Tessa into the secret world of the werewolf where she finds that  werewolves are responsible for most of the technological and artistic  advances in civilization. She is completely seduced into this world, and  wants to experience &quot;the passion&quot;, the most intense werewolf  experience when they change into the wolf form. Tessa is told that no human  could withstand 'the passion', that it would consume her. That she could  never mate with one of them. This ultimately leds to a tale of betrayal. I  highly recommend this book and can't wait to read the sequel to this one,  The Promise.	1999-12-07

I have been looking forward to this title ever since I heard it was going to be released. I just finished it and WOW! It does not disappoint! Crichton's heros are sent  from the present to the past thru a &quot;quantum foam wormhole,&quot; and  step out in feudal France circa 1357. The historians have been sent back to  rescue one of their collegues who has become trapped in the past. And they  need to rescue him in precisely 37 hours, or miss the trip back to 1999.  This novel starts out very technical, but quickly switches to a  &quot;swashbuckling tale&quot; with knights, damsels in distress, and much,  much more! This was a quick read for me; I finished it in about a day and  1/2. The ending was predictable, but all in all, a good time!	1999-12-07

Just in time for the holidays, like a Christmas present from my favorite author.  This title is only available on audio, so don't bother looking for a book version.  It is  3 stories read by the author himself, all dealing with smoking, hence the  title, and you can't have a Stephen King book without a little blood.

I picked this book up because of the blurb on the front which said, &quot;The most terrifying thriller since 'Silence of the Lambs'&quot;.  I thought, &quot;What a bold statement for a book to make.&quot;  Believe me,  this book does not disappoint!  It takes place in England which threw me at  first because of the different terms they use, but you get past that in a  hurry.  This book is simply one of the best books I have read this year.  I  have recommended this title to over a hundred people!  No really, I have.   And I have yet to hear anything bad about this book.  I can't wait to see  what else Mr. Starling writes.  If you are a fan of Thomas Harris, Jeffrey  Deaver, or John Sandford, I urge you to buy this book!  You will not be  disappointed!  It will be the best money you've spent on a book this year.   The ending is mind blowing and I literally had to stop and think about it.	1999-11-24
