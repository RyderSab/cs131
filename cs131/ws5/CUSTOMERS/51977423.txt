I found my copy for a buck at a used book store.  This is a fantastic text, and DeLong's presentation of horary technique is clear and simple.    This was my first introduction to horary astrology, and I still think it is one of the best.  DeLong uses many traditional techniques, but also uses the outer planets, something traditionalists don't.  She doesn't address some of the finer points of traditional astrology, like the use of antiscia, but I think this is a good, since it keeps chart reading much easier than it is when you start introducing all manner of other factors to complicate things.  I got very accurate readings using this book--far more accurate, in fact, than when I followed the guidelines of more comprehensive (and excellent) texts like Christian Astrology or Anthony Louis' Horary Astrology Plain and Simple. Olivia Barclay's book is fine, too.  But if you find DeLong's at a good price in a use bookstore, grab it!  It contains everything you need to know to read horary charts accurately.	2005-05-23

I know...Bill Phillips became a multimillionaire providing advice on steroid use to bodybuilders.  I guess that makes him an advocate of illegal drug use. Yes, a business partner of his was convicted felon (steroid-peddler). But that's not what this book is about.  This is not a book for bodybuilders, muscle freaks, juice-shooting glandular cases. It's for ordinary schlubs who just want to be healthy.  And it's good.<br /><br />What is great about this book is that it shows you how to get the most in terms of fitness with the least amount of work. That isn't to say there isn't work--there is, lots of it.  You work out 6 days a week, but the workouts are short and intense.  I saw much more dramatic results faster lifting 3 days a week for 45 minutes & and doing cardio 3 days a week for 20 than I ever saw working out for an hour and a half 5 or 6 times a week.<br /><br />Other reviews have described the regime (and you can also find it online at the Body for Life website), so I won't bother rehashing that here...<br /><br />The before-and-after photographs in this book are probably a little disingenuous.  Some of them show a muslce gain that simply isn't possible in 12 weeks--it take time to build muscle.  In some photographs, it is obvious that the subject had a foundation of muscle under the fat.  But this program DOES deliver what it promises--dramatic fat loss and substantial muscle gain in 12 weeks.  The secret to this program, I think--the one that distinguishes it from other routines--is not just diet and exercise, but rest.  You have a full 4 or 5 days of rest for a body part after you work it.  For example, if you work the upper body on Monday, you won't work it again until Friday. This gives the body plenty of time to recuperate and actually build muscle.  The way I worked out before starting this program allowed only a couple of days for recuperation, so my muscles were never allowed fully to repair themselves, and as a result I did not give myself enough time to reap the benefits from my workout.<br /><br />I found that it is much more important to be religious about diet than about exercise.  Instead of killing myself on the treadmill for every cardio session, for instance, I would often play raquetball for an hour, or go on a 45 minute-to-and-hour bike ride--which would be strenuous, but not at the level of intensity that my treadmill sessions would reach.  Still, I lost a lot of fat and built a lot of muscle.<br /><br />It's a good program, and if you stick to it for 12 weeks, you'll love how you feel.  You'll start loving it before then, even.from my workout.      I found that it is much more important to be religious about diet than about exercise.

Books	4	24	24	N	Y	Pretty Good, and No Hype	I own a few speed reading books, and all but one of them (the snake-oily \\"PhotoReading\\") are responsible, and instruct you in pretty much the same way.  Once you realize what your bad habits are as far as reading goes--re-reading, sub-vocalization, etc.--it is a pretty simple matter to rid yourself of them and notice a sudden dramatic increase in reading speed.  At least I did.  Getting crazy-fast, though, is another horse entirely, though.<br /><br />This leads me to what I like about this book.  Ostrov doesn't make wild claims about the sort of improvement you will notice, and is very straightforward about the sort of limitations the vast majority of readers will encounter.  But he does present a sound system for improving speed and comprehension--and like other systems, it involves (very basically) getting an overview of the material, reading it, organizing information.<br /><br />My favorite book on the subject is still probably Breakthrough Rapid Reading (Peter Kump).  I like the detailed, graduated lesson plans.  But there are only so many ways to skin a cat, and Ostrov's little book does it just fine.	2005-05-12

She is a complete kook.  You don't get beyond the introduction of this book without realizing where she is coming from, viz., a la-la land of misandry, where everything male is evil, violent, and destructive, and where everything female is life-affirming sweetness, and light.  I sometimes use this text in my classes, and when I finish reading students the introduction, even the women sit there with their mouths agape...they just don't appreciate the articulate, nay, the poetic, ramblings of a damaged, if brilliant, mind.  Sadly, though, Daly's brilliance IS corrupted by her woefully distorted view of the world...She yearns for a better world, a world without men, where women don't enjoy a male caress, and can reproduce without a man's contribution (see Gyn/Ecology).<br /><br />And no, men are not threatened by Daly. That's too easy a dismissal.<br /><br />I give this book only 1 star because it is offered in all seriousness, and what it offers is in fact hateful nonsense that will appeal only to minds and hearts as damaged as Daly's.  If, though, you want to read it as a parody of the most extreme sort of feminism (and Daly IS extreme--she would not allow men in her feminist ethics classes at Boston College, and was eventually, FINALLY, forced out of academia for it), then I give this 5 stars.  It's a crazy ride, full of vivid language and wild rants. It can be lots of fun, viewed the right way.	2005-05-12

But this one has achieved \\"classic\\" status, and is cheap, so I thought what the hell.  I'm not disappointed.  I can't honestly say whether or not the methods in this book really work (methods which amount to what is taught in the weak-minded New Age community today--visualization, affirmation, etc.; maybe there's something to it, I don't know), but the book is well-written, and well-organized and overall very clear in its instruction.<br /><br />I don't buy the anecdotal evidence Hill presents as evidence of anything--no one should--but Hill does manage to write himself into a pitch of sincere enthusiasm that is contagious.  And I can't help but think that any reader who manages to maintain a certain level of optimism, hope, and perseverence that Hill ignites in him will benefit in at least some small measure.<br /><br />I should clarify--this is NOT New Age pabulum.  Hill's directions do involve affirmation and visualization, but he also emphasizes action, and planning.  He advocates practical methods, not pseudo-metaphysical mumbo-jumbo.<br /><br />It's kind of amusing, too, to see him write in a tone of unconcealed adoration about the old robber barons.	2005-05-11

I'm glad I got a used copy, because what I received is a volume of weak-minded New Age pabulum.  I thought it would be interesting to see how the symbols of the tarot might be used for shadow work, but I was expecting--hoping for?--something considerably more rigorous and credible, something with the clarity and common-sense applications of, say, a Robert A. Johnson book.  But, unlike Johnson, Jette is not an analyst, and so we get a lot of pseudo-pagan nonsense about casting circles of protection and crystals.  I can't take seriously declarations like, \\"Onyx can cause depression in some...\\" or \\"Rose quartz radiates universal love,\\" or \\"Diamonds hold, absorb, magnify, and transmit pain.\\" Is there really any clinical evidence to prove this, or is the author just passing along the standard gruel that she has read in other Llewellyn publications?<br /><br />The author's method uses only the trump cards.  I guess the standard wisdom is that the major arcana represent archetypes, and the Jungian psychology on which shadow work is predicated also relies on archetypes, but that seems to be as much of a reason that we get for limiting ourselves to 22 of 78 cards.  It seems arbitrary an unnecessarily restrictive.  After all, the entire deck presents a much wider range of experience than the 22 cards do, and to limit ourselves to the major trumps just because they have been historically referred to as \\"archetypes\\" seems silly and illogical.  The unconscious--where the Shadow dwells--speaks the language of symbols, and there is no reason whatsoever to assume that it can only respond to the symbols presented in the trump cards.<br /><br />The author claims to be non-sectarian in her presentation, but that seems to really mean that she is non-religious, at least in the sense of any mainstream religion.  But her repeated references to \\"Crone wisdom\\" and her exhortation to call upon \\"Crone power\\" during shadow work belie that.  The rituals she presents use wiccan rhetoric.  Here's an example:  \\"I ask that the Dark Goddess...bless and protect me during this rite.  I ask for wisdom, guidance, and comfort as I deeply mourn my losses.  I release the past and I am free.  This is correct and for the good of all.  May it harm none.  So shall it be.\\"  Non-sectarian, my eye.<br /><br />I don't really have a problem with the use of ritual, or candle-burning, or any of that.  I don't think this stuff works in any supernatural or magical way--and there is certainly no credible evidence to suggest they do--but the unconscious does seem responsive to the symbols of ritual, and I think a good argument can be made for making healthy, life-affirming rituals a large part of our lives.  But calling on \\"Crone power\\"....well, I don't think so.<br /><br />This book is written by a woman and seems aimed primarily at women, although that might not be obvious on first reading.  I don't think it excludes men, but where gender-specific issues are brought up, they tend to be female issues like rape and menopause and domestic abuse.  That's fine, I guess, if you're a woman, or a Sensitive New Age guy who responds to the nurturing warm fuzzies this book throws around.  I'm not that kind of guy, though, and don't respond to it--that is my own subjective experience, and not a problem with the book, which is free to find any audience it wants. (Readers might object that the crystal-healing nonsense is also free to find its own audience, and in a sense they might be right, but I think it is a completely different thing to pass off crystal-healing mumbo-jumbo as therapy.)<br /><br />I still think that the symbolism of tarot might be used effectively for shadow work, and that the author's idea was a good one.  Jette is sincere in what she offers, and her writing strong.  She seems to genuinely care about helping people.	2005-05-10

It was pretty grim, and I was convinced that I was one of those people who was born damned with a horrible voice.     I might be damned, or I might not be, but after working with this book for a month-and-a-half or so, I am definitely improving.  I can't say I'm a *good* singer, but I'm certainly a better singer.    I have two other books on singing (the \\"...for Complete Idiots\\" guide, and the \\"Rock-n-Roll Singers Survival Manual\\") and this is easily the best of the lot, at least for me.  The exercises on the accompanying CD are great, and start to help almost immediately.  I have not seen these exercises in either of the other two books I own, or anywhere on the web.      The writing is clear and direct.  Love doesn't waste page after page discussing the most minor details of anatomy, the way, say, the \\"Survival Manual\\" does.  The information is organized clearly and sensibly, and the book presents exercises that help undo bad habits.  You might feel funny making some of these bizarre sounds at first, but they work; I practice them on the 25-minute drive to and from work.  It's time better spent than listening to the radio.    My biggest problem was--and still is--a rising larynx.  Both the other books I have identify this as a common problem, but give virtually no instruction on how to keep the larynx low, and no indication of how difficult a problem this is to lick.  Love does.  No, I haven't licked the problem, but at least now I know HOW to lick it, and that it isn't going to happen overnight.    This book doesn't contain instruction on sight reading, but that doesn't bother me, since I have no interest in it--I just want to get to a point at which I will not embarrass myself singing along with guitar, and I feel that this book has set me going in that direction.	2005-05-09

It is clear to me that Mr. Baxter is passionate about singing, and teaching singing, and that this book--to which he provided not just the text, but the illustrations too--is his baby.  For these reasons, he should fire his editor.... <br /> <br />The book is full of typos, and very poorly organized.  The typos I can live with.  The over-development of some topics, and under-development of others, and the problematic organization...I can't live with them.   <br /> <br />First, there is much too much unnecessary verbiage concerning anatomy.  We simply don't need page after page after page of detailed anatomical charts and descriptions of our \\"instrument.\\"  Some, yes, but not volumes.  The space would have been much better spent providing useful exercises for, say, keeping the larynx low, which Baxter  says is vitally important (and he's not alone), but for which there is practically no instruction beyond \\"feel your Adam's apple, and when it rises, force it down.\\"  Okay, great--HOW? <br /> <br />There IS useful information in this book, but it is so often buried in what seems to me to be unnecessary exposition that you often have  to dig for it.  I think it would have been much more helpful to begin with some basic anatomy, then some typical problems, their remedies (exercises), and then more detailed instruction for fine-tuning your singing.   <br /> <br />I found some of the breathing exercises helpful, but got so tired of wading through the excessive exposition that I got another book (Roger Love's, which I strongly recommend over this one), one that more closely meets my needs.  This book does not come with a CD, so if you want to do the exercises, you will need a musical instrument of some sort to practice with--and not a wind instrument!   <br /> <br />I suppose this book might serve as a useful reference, and that's why I gave it three stars instead of two, but as a book of practical instruction, I'm afraid it falls short.  You won't hit the ground running, or notice dramatic improvements quickly if you rely on this book.  The exact opposite is true of Roger Love's book, which is why I recommend you get it before this one.	2005-05-09

If you aren't already familiar with guitar basics, you'll probably be mystified by at least some of what Rooksby presents here.  He devotes a great deal of space, for instance, to discussing various chord progressions, but he does so almost entirely in the key of C & Am--if you don't know how to figure out how to go from, say, a II, V, I, VI, I, VI progression in C to the same in E (or whatever), you'll either be lost, or at the very least stuck in C until you get some theory basics under your belt.  You don't need a lot, but you do need some.   <br /> <br />Also, don't expect to find instruction on playing rhythm, or lead, or this style or that style, or scale patterns....  There are plenty of good books dealing with this sort of instruction; this one isn't one of those.  And it doesn't pretend to be one of them.  It might touch on some of these areas, but only as it relates to songwriting, specifically songwriting on guitar.   <br /> <br />But this book does provide a wealth of progressions, and examples of popular songs that use those progressions.  Rooksby also discusses harmony, rhythms, intervals, modes, and alternate tunings.  In fact, he presents a BUNCH of alternate tunings, not just the most widely-used G/A, D/E, and drop D tunings (the most popular).  He also provides an abundance of chords for each tuning--very handy!   <br /> <br />The book also presents a useful, in-depth discussion of key changes within songs, what works, what doesn't. <br /> <br />There are also chapters on composing lyrics, structuring songs, finding subjects, avoiding cliches, making demos.   <br /> <br />This is a great resource for any guitarist who already knows the basics, not just songwriters. If you are interesting in writing, or even just playing, popular music, this is a great book.	2005-05-02

This book presents a psycholotgical/cultural interpretation of the Dionysus muths in a simple, direct, and usually-insightful manner.  <br /> <br /> The author sometimes uses too-broad strokes, trotting out wild generalizations about cultural phenomena that seem a little too superficial, a little too pat to be wholly convincing. <br /> <br />Also, if you are looking for a *practical* book, this probably isn't it.  The chapter on using the Dionysus myth in your own life is woefully thin, which the author admits right off the bat.  In fact, he refers you to his earlier book, Inner Works, for a more detailed, specific method of practical applications.  That said, Johnson's thin volumes (this one is about 90 pages), really need to be read and used in conjunction with that book.	2005-05-01

I own several horary books (Watters, Goldstein-Jacobson, Coley, Lilly, DeLong, Barclay, etc.), but this one distills the best of all of them.      Many books present solid, rather rigid, systems of horary interpretation.  This isn't necessarily bad.  DeLong's book, for example, provides methods that yield excellent results. Goldstein-Jacobson's method also presents a direct, rule-bound method that many people love--I find it a little restrictive. Dr. Louis' text, though, synthesizes a wide--and I mean WIDE--range of texts, tests different methods, and leaves the reader to experiment and find which methods work for him.  This might seem overwhelming at first blush to a beginner, but it shouldn't, since the basics remain pretty much the same regardless whom you're reading. And, trust me, this book is much more accessible to the average reader than some of the bibles of horary (like Christian Astrology).       This book leans heavily towards traditional horary astrology, but does not ignore the outer planets as many traditional horary adherents tend to do.  Also, different astrologers present different techniques for timing events, and locating lost objects, dicey endeavors at best; but Louis presents those methods and tests them with sample charts--and leave it to the reader to choose. He seems to be guiding the reader towards a deeper understanding of horary, one that will allow him to judge a chart based not just on a set of traditional rules, but on what the chart itself is suggesting, or emphasizing; charts are often ambiguous and difficult to read, and marrying yourself ideologically to a specific system can make them even more difficult, at least in my experience.      Louis references astrologers from the ancients through the present.      The book presents what is often confusing information & nomenclature in easily-understood language, using a chatty and anecdotal style.  It's a pleasure to read, and a must-have reference for anyone interested in horary.  If you want to learn horary, there is no better place to start.	2005-04-28

I bought it because I had Anthony Louis' horary astrology book, and loved it. Unlike horary astrology, though, tarot--as presented here--really is plain and simple. <br /> <br />This book doesn't mire itself in the sort of occult esoterica or pseudo-psychobabble new age gibberish that many tarot books do (good ones, too).  It is aimed at the beginner who wants to use the cards for divination.  Louis doesn't spend time deconstructing the symbolic minutiae of tarot--and given the deck he chose to illustrate the book (Robin Wood), that's a good decision.  Instead, he gives an abundance of interpretive descriptions for each card in both upright and reversed positions, something I wish I had when I started reading cards as a kid, and even later in life. <br /> <br />Dr. Louis must like the Robin Wood deck--after all, he chose it.  I've never been crazy about it, although I admit the naked babes depicted in some of the cards are hotties!  Hey, it's a reason. I've always been partial to the Thoth deck (you can't beat the striking, sometimes disturbing artwork) and the Rider-Waite deck, and to books that use them.  But the Wood deck is pretty similar to the Rider-Waite deck in terms of interpretive symbolism, and to others based on the Rider pack, so unless you are using a deck that really bastardizes the traditional symbols (like the hilarious atrocity that is Motherpeace, or the trippy Voyager), Louis' interpretations should go well with your deck. (They don't go particularly well with the Thoth deck, which is a traditional deck, flavored here and there with Aleister Crowley's unique and unfortunate view of things.) <br /> <br />This is, arguably, the perfect book for the beginning tarot reader.

First of all, he rightly recognizes that marriage is not just a religious institution, it is a social one.  By legalizing gay marriage--and even civil unions--you are forcing people not only to accept, but to endorse behavior that they find abnormal and morally abhorrent.  Like it or not, marriage is, by definition, the union of a man and a woman; it has never been anything else, until very recently in those mercifully few countries that have legalized it.  Dismissing this fact as a reactionary loyalty to tradition doesn't change it.   <br /> <br />Gay marriage probably won't weak the instution of marriage as a whole--it is on shaky legs as it is--but it certainly won't help it.  The state regulates marriage as it is--we are NOT free to marry whomever we want, and just because we might want to badly, that doesn't make it our right.  It is government's job to protect the interests of its citizens, and clearly citizens feel they have a very strong interest in NOT redefining marriage.  And in fact, gays do have the same rights as the rest of us, contrary to what Mr. Rauch suggests.  Gays are free to marry a member of the opposite sex, within the boundaries set by law.  That they don't want to is hardly society's fault, and hardly a reason to change a fundamental social institution, just to satisfy their desires. <br /> <br />His arguments that gay marriage is not a slippery slope remain unconvincing.  If objective values like tradition are so easily discarded to accomodate a small minority of malcontents, then what logical reasons can there be not to accomodate other malcontents? Does this mean that we can realistically expect people to petition to marry their dogs?  Of course not.  But is there really a compelling argument, then, for continuing to outlaw polygamy?  No. <br /> <br />I agree with Rauch regarding leaving the argument to legislators rather than the judiciary.  Most Americans despise the idea of having a judiciary shove its values down our throats, and this more than anything is probably what has given traction to the anti's position.  As a matter of strategy, it's bad for gays; as a matter of policy, it's bad for America. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-31

I didn't even know the basics, the cardinal rules of gun safety, and when I went to apply for my pistol permit at the Sheriff's office, they had no idea, either, where I could go for basic firearm instruction.   All I knew (and fortunately I knew THAT much) was that you don't point guns at people, and you keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.<br />Joe Pierre's \\"Handguns and Freedom: Their Care and Maintenance\\" would have been an excellent book for me to own back then, before I purchased my first gun, and, indeed, it is an excellent book for me to own now.  The book's focus is split, as the title suggests, between practical handgun selection and shooting, and the politics of gun ownership and gun control.  <br />For a novice handgunner, the shooting instruction will prove invaluable.  I've been target shooting for a number of years, not many, but enough to be familiar with and comfortable shooting handguns.  Recently, though, I noticed my aim drifting.  And not just a little-a lot.  Instead of getting better, I was getting worse!  I had no idea why, all of a sudden, I couldn't hit something the size of a tractor trailer from 6 feet away!  Joe Pierre's book, however, provides  exercises that reveal to the \\"barrel dipper\\" the source of his problem, and the means to remedy the problem.  Had I read his book when I began shooting, I would have practiced these techniques  (which include dry-firing, to notice how at the moment of trigger break the barrel dips off to the side) from the very beginning, and would now, undoubtedly, be having far less trouble disabusing myself of the bad habits I have developed over the years.  <br />Joe Pierre loves his guns, and he loves talking about them.  There is a chapter on individual handguns, and he strolls among them like a collector showing you his goodies, telling you a little bit about this one, alittle bit about that one, how this one is favored in westerns, and how that one, immortalized by Dirty Harry, really is too heavy to carry around all day...it is an informal look at a range of weapons, peppered with practical information that someone making his first purchase (or his 5th) is bound to find useful.<br />Mr. Pierre makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is a happy (gun totin') member of what the harpy-half of the Billery Monster once hilariously lamented as the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy.\\"   He loves talking gun control.  He has chapters devoted especially to the politics of gun control, and the media's treatment of the subject, although, really, the politics of gun ownership creeps into virtually all the subjects in the book.  He aims his discussion, I think, at a narrow audience: those of us who are already inclined to regard his argument with sympathy, and not be put off by terms like \\"liberal\\" (which, yes, IS a filthy word), \\"elite media,\\" or \\"gun-control fanatics.\\"  It is not, therefore, what I would consider vigorous argumentation, although such arguments can successfully be made, since the fact ARE on our side...But perhaps Mr. Pierre is wise in his choice of audience.  There is no dissuading an ideologue, no matter how sound your logic, or how irrefutable your facts. (I am fairly well-versed in the facts and statistics of gun crime, and have no problem refuting the gun-banners' superficial, largely emotional understanding of the issue.  When presented with a calm and reasoned argument they can't refute, they typically become abusive; one even paused, regarded me, and shamelessly declared, \\"You don't think those facts MEAN anything to me, do you?\\"  Well, silly me, yeah, I thought they might.)  No...Mr. Pierre's purpose here is less to convert or disprove the opposition than it is to show gun owners that we have cause for concern, that there IS an army of the night out there, immune to reason, immune to notions of Constitutionality, for whomall truth must first be purified in an alembic of left-wing social ideology.  It doesn't matter, for instance, as Mr. Pierre points out, that parts of the country that permit liberal (and here I'm using the word in its non-filthy sense!) carry of concealed weapons-places like Florida-have enjoyed a greater reduction in violent crime than, say, New York City, or Los Angeles, where gun control is a government-enforced religion.  It doesn't matter, for instance, that the gun control whackos who were rending their shirts and weeping over the \\"immanent\\" shoot-outs in the street when Florida was getting ready to pass its shall-issue concealed carry law-it doesn't matter that these shoot-outs not only didn't occur, but that crime decreased.  It doesn't matter that time and again the methodology of gun control advocates is shown to be faulty, or brazenly dishonest (look at Michael Bellesiles-would that all liars should meet with his fate).<br />Mr. Pierre includes a chapter on field stripping and cleaning a 1911-style semi-automatic pistol, and a Colt revolver.  If you own these guns, you might find this chapter useful.  I'm not very familiar with revolvers, but I know there can be considerable differences among semi-autos, so, really, the best source of information on maintaining your particular gun will be the manual that comes with it.  Pierre's chapter on the subject, though, is useful in that it details the tools you should have, and you can, therefore, assemble them before your first gun purchase.<br />Someone new to handguns and the issues surrounding them, I think this book is extremely handy.   Buy it. And get a copy for a friend.	2003-01-27

O'Neil combines the very best techniques of fundamental and technical analysis to create a superior investment paradigm.  True, not infrequently he plugs his publication, Investors Business Daily, but in my experience, what he says about it is true. In terms of investment advice for active stock market players, there is probably no better source of information than IBD, and this book teaches you how to make the most of it.<br />This book is not for the hotdog day trader.  O'Neil's method emphasizes choosing companies with strong fundamentals (particularly EPS acceleration) in leading industries just as those stocks are breaking out of base patterns.  It requires diligence and, I think, daily work.  But his methods work.  I know because I've made more successful investments using the CANSLIM method than any other way.  It might not be as much FUN as trying, for instance, a strictly technical approach, or trying to program a trading system into your charting software, but the sheer bread-and-butter value of this book is inestimable.

Don't buy them.   If you want serious, practical, and LEGAL ways to hide yourself, or simply to secure a higher level of privacy, *this* is the book for you.<br />I've read a few other books dealing with privacy, and, sadly, they too often recommend tactics that depend primarily on illegal moves-- moves, moreover, that will simply no longer work--like securing the Social Security Number of a dead person, or the birth certificate.  Most of the Mr. Luna's methods depend on perfectly legal strategies, and he outlines ways for people to secure varying levels of privacy, depending on their needs.  Surprisingly, a high level of privacy can be obtained simply by using what he calls a &quot;ghost&quot; address (which is NOT a Mailboxes Etc. account!), and making sure that no mail--but none--ever comes directly to your home.  All utility bills, drivers licenses, and so forth, go to the ghost address.  Perfectly legal.  Where Mr. Luna is unsure of the legality of something he is describing, he makes it perfectly clear.  <br />A list of chapter titles will give a good idea of the topics this book covers:<br />1.  How this Book Can Make You Invisible 2.  U.S. Mail--Sending It, Receiving It 3. Your &quot;Ghost&quot; Address 4. Home Deliveries, House Calls, Bounty Hunters, FedEx, UPS 5. Untraceable Trash, Anonymous Utilities 6. Your Social Security Number and Date of Birth 7. Your Alternative Names and Signatures 8. Telephones, Answering Machines, Faxes, Radios, Beepers 9. How to Find and Use Nominees 10. How to Use a Trust for Privacy 11. Strange Uses for Corporations 12.  Limited-Liability Companies 13. Hidden Ownership of Vehicles, and Real Estate 14. Bank Accounts and Money Transfers 15. How to Secretly Run a Home-Based Business 16. Anonymous Travel by Land, Sea, and Air 17. Computer, E-mail, and the Internet 18. Crossing the Canadian and Mexican Borders 19. Secret Hiding Places 20. Cool Stuff That Did Not Fit in Earlier 21.  An Exam, as Secret, and an Invitation<br />There is also an appendix with the names of people who will act as agents for a LLC.<br />The book is quite thorough in some areas, less thorough in others, such as Internet privacy.  He mentions the use of encryption, &quot;remailers&quot;, and so forth, but really gives no information on using them, other than to admonish us, &quot;Don't, they aren't secure.&quot; There is, I suspect, much more to be said about computer security, file wiping, and so forth, than has been said here.<br />Mr. Luna outlines some uses of a Limited Liability Company, although, unfortunately, does not describe how you might set one up yourself, recommending you shell out the $2,000 dollars + to have a lawyer do the paperwork if you need this level of privacy.  Some mention of less costly sources of legal guidance (for those of us on a budget!) would have been helpful--it's  out there (Nolo Press, for instance).<br />But, then, few people need very high levels of security, and to belabor this would be to emphasize a small, small part of the book.  This is a GOOD book, and INTERESTING book, and a USEFUL book.  Definitely worth a look.	2001-01-27

It addressed an issue--gun control--that I had little interest in, and didn't follow.  But the furor it caused was unmistakeable.  Since then, however, have grown increasingly interested in the subject.  There is a lot of noise coming from both sides of the fight.  Lott's voice, however, is one of the most reasonable and convincing of them all.  <br />Enough has been said about this book in the other Amazon reviews so that I don't need to repeat any of the arguments or counterarguments.  Suffice it to say the evidence is irrefutable unless you are willing--nay, compelled--to engage in the most tortuous exercises of rationalization.  Lott is clearly not an ideologue.  He is precise and meticulous in his analyses of the data.  The arguments of his detractors are, well, sometimes amusing, sometimes bizarre.  None of their arguments--which he addresses in the updated edition of this book--can match the utter simplicity of the common sense that his study finally proves:  Criminals fear armed citizens.<br />Is this book exciting?  Well, maybe if you dig statistical analysis.  If you have an interest in the issue of gun control, however, it's must reading.	2000-10-19

In an earlier review, I suggested that Zorn's book, &quot;Speed Reading,&quot; was the best.  It is indeed a fine book.  Kump's book, however, give a more  realistic idea of the kind of work it takes to boost your reading speed.  Other books give a smattering of exercises--often very good ones--without  emphasizing the kind of practice that is necessary, or even that you won't  necessarily be able to maintain high speeds across all types of reading  material.<br />Kump uses familiar reading exercises, and variations on them.   The lessons are brief, and each lesson contains short (10-15 minutes)  exercises; at the end of each lesson, you are instructed to do a series of  drills.  Kump wants you to spend about a week on each series of drills, and  to repeat them every day.  They can take anywhere from 15 minutes to an  hour or more a day, depending on how much time you are willing to spend.   I've found most--but not all--drills useful.  The ones that were not useful  to me drilled on skills I already had (recognizing levels of specificity  within paragraphs, for instance). <br />Here's an example of one particularly  useful drill.  Kump has you read for 2 minutes, as fast as you can with  comprehension.  Then you read the same material again, trying to read a  little faster, and a little further, in the same amount of time.  And  again.  You do this four times.  A variation of this is to read for 1  minute, then a little faster for another minute, and then to &quot;practice  read&quot; (i.e., move your eyes quickly across the words, without worrying  about comprehension) twice the longest passage in the same amount of time.   Then you practice read three times the original (that is, the longest of  the first two 1-minute drills) in one minute.  <br />One REALLY nice thing  about this book is that Kump has you use your own reading material, your  own books.  Other books include selections for you to practice with, most  of which are tedious, simplistic, or just too brief.  Kump's exercises  work, and you can read your own books while you practice.	2000-07-26

If all you read of Crowleys work is this book, it will be very hard to see why.  Indeed, it  will probably be hard to see why even if you read more.<br />This book was  supposedly dictated to Crowley on his honeymoon, by a spirit called Aiwaz.  It details a &quot;religion&quot; that can only be called hateful--Jews,  Christians, Hindus, and Muslims...all condemned!  &quot;This is the law of  the strong,&quot; Aiwaz declares.  In other words, might makes right.  When  Crowley/Aiwaz writes, &quot;Love is the law, love under will,&quot; what  are we to believe?  There is nothing in here, really, about love--Crowley  was notorious for his smorgasbord of depraved sexual practices...perhaps  this line is what he used to justify them.  The most memorable line from  &quot;Liber AL,&quot; as it is frequently called, is the infamous, &quot;Do  What Thou Wilt...&quot; which, contrary to Crowley's wild self-promotion,  was plagiarized from Rabelais.<br />Most of what is here is barely  intelligible, and lacks an iota of literary merit by any widely-accepted  aesthetic standard.  Crowley was a third-rate writer who (believe it or  not) honestly believed he was a greater poet than his magical arch-rival,  Wm. Butler Yeats, who once referred to Crowley as &quot;that man of  unspeakable life.&quot;  Any reasonable person who reads Crowley's opinions  of Jews and blacks (and the frequent ethnic slurs he deploys while talking  about them) will be inclined to agree.  Some of this is apparent in Liber  AL; it is pretty hard to take.<br />Nevertheless, for anyone interested in  Victorian esotericism, this may be an interesting read, as a cultural  artifact, if nothing else.	2000-07-08

This final installment in the &quot;Mr. Watson&quot; trilogy is, alas, in some ways the most disappointing.  This isn't to say it isn't enjoyable, but having made it through both &quot;Killing Mr. Watson&quot; and  &quot;Lost Man's River,&quot; it's difficult, and perhaps unreasonable, to  expect us not to judge this book in the light of its predecessors.  <br />This  book is a much easier read than the detective-like &quot;Lost Man's  River,&quot; which followed Lucius Watson's seemingly interminable journey  all over Florida as he hunted for evidence of his father's innocence.  In  &quot;Bone by Bone,&quot; told in the first person from the perspective of  E.J. Watson himself, the mystery and doubt so perfectly balanced with drama  and violence in &quot;Killing Mr. Watson&quot; is removed.  Watson tells  his own story, shows us how he became the violent man he is, and reveals to  the reader his whole person.  <br />The names in this book are confusing...I  can't recall reading a book in which so many names are thrown at you.   There is a gloss of family relationships at the beginning of the book,  which helps somewhat, but I still found myself losing track of people,  especially since we were dealing with members of the same family.<br />In both  &quot;Lost Man's River&quot; and &quot;Bone by Bone,&quot; Matthiessen  editorializes--through his characters--quite a bit about race issues.   Given that these stories are situated in the post-Civil War South, it is  not inappropriate that there should be some race issues, but the manner in  which the characters editorialize (rather than letting the action of the  narrative speak for itself) makes that commentary stick out like a broken  wing.  The problem of race, and the situation of blacks, becomes less an  organic part of the story (as it is in Faulkner) than asides the writer  makes to remind us of the racial horrors of the Reconstruction  South.<br />Watson's voice is clear throughout, although there are certain  inconsistencies.  He speaks for the most part in elevated, literary English  (using complex metaphor, at times).  We are told that as a child he read  the Greek classics.  Nevertheless, he cannot spell, and sometimes, for no  apparent reason, he lapses into backwoods diction.<br />In &quot;Killing Mr.  Watson,&quot; Watson came off as a brooding, violent, secretive man.  Here,  we see the guts of the man, the joker, the father, the husband.  This side  is effectively blended with the violence and the brooding we saw earlier.   It will be hard to appreciate this, though, if you haven't first read  &quot;Killing Mr. Watson.&quot;  (You don't really need to read &quot;Lost  Man's River&quot; to get the full effect of this noverl, although you will  be more sensitive to the drama involving Lucius and Rob.)	2000-06-28

All these books repeat material found in other books, to a greater or lesser degree...he recycles the same  information over and over and over again, and his various books are, it  seems, often little more than an expansion upon a core idea presented  elsewhere.<br />Be that as it may, the information and techniques he presents  are generally fairly sound.  I have yet to buy one of his books and to feel  ripped off having done so...which is not something I can say about all the  brainpower (or accelerated learning) books I've bought. One thing I like  about Buzan's books is that they don't promise the sky, which SOOOOOO many  other books in this genre do.  <br />This books presents 5 simple memory  enhancement techniques, devices that can be used to memorize relatively  short lists of information (under 20, generally).  There is also a  &quot;Master System&quot; which can be used to memorize 1,000 or more  pieces of information.  (Annoyingly, if you want to further develop this  system, Buzan refers you to one of his other books--in fact, he refers you  to his other books througout.)  The systems can be modified to accomodate  different types of information, and for different purposes.  There is  instruction on remember names and face, phone numbers, poems, dramatic  parts, and exam information.<br />Does it work?  Actually, yes.  There is  nothing groundbreaking here, and nothing magical, but with minimal  practice, you will enjoy noticeable results.  I haven't used the Master  System, so I cannot comment from experience on it, but the principles that  it uses are the same as those used in the &quot;smaller&quot; systems, so  there is no reason it shouldn't work. This stuff does take an effort,  though, and in some cases it is probably better simply to *write* a list,  rather than spend the time committing it to memory using  even a minor  system.	2000-06-26

It displays none of the often unsettling preoccupation with sex that some of Roth's other books do.  This novel examines the rise and fall of a man with a life that  all his acquaintances thought was blessed--a start athlete and war hero,  who goes on successfully to run his father's glove factory.   A  non-religious Jew, he marries a pretty Catholic girl (the former Miss New  Jersey!), lives in a nice house, and has a pretty daughter, Merry--slips  comfortably, in other words, into mainstream America.<br />Merry grows up,  though, to be a sociopath, a fanatic, who as part of the general 60's  counterculture movement, commits a terrible act of violence, and has to go  into hiding...for the rest of her life.  Her act destroys the foundations  of Swede's world.  We watch him and those close to him slowly disintegrate,  emotionally and spiritually.  Their decline is not a decline in material  fortunes, but it is slow and gruelling nevertheless.  <br />Roth writes like  an angel.  Much of this book is expository, written in precise, evocative,  sometimes Faulkneresque, sometimes academic prose.  The characters are  vivid, immediate, and believable. This is also an idea book, though, and  often the ideas are left abstract...which isn't bad.  Roth doesn't try to  force answers where perhaps none exist.  <br />This book is truly a treat.	2000-06-26

Judging by the success stories in all these speed reading books I've been going over, there sure are a lot of 800+wpm readers out there (among whom I DO NOT rank!).  This book makes similar fantastic claims...you can read up  to 3,000 wpm, etc.<br />One thing this book is pretty emphatic about, though,  is that this kind of speed takes WORK, and regular &quot;workouts.&quot;   In other words, you have keep at it, or you lose the ability.  <br />The book  doesn't focus on speed reading.  Rather, it presents a whole learning  system, of which speed reading is a part.  I bought it primarily because it  was cheap, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that there is some  pretty sound study-skills instruction here.  <br />This is very much another  accelerated learning book, without explicitly being touted as one.   Kaplan's main reading strategy is &quot;Layered Reading,&quot; which, if  you've read other books in this field, you'll recognize.  You begin by  previewing (headings, bold print, etc.), then do a fast &quot;read&quot;  through, at 2-4 seconds a page, to get a little more information, then do  it again at a slightly slower speed, then, back to the beginning, and read  through at your comfortable reading speed.  Then you review.  <br />How can  this possibly be &quot;accelerated&quot;?  Because when you read, you read  at 1500 words per minute. If you can, that is!  The key to speedy learning  with this system--as, arguably, with all these accelerated learning  systems--is being able to read fast. Very fast. <br />This book's sub-900 wpm  reading tactic involves learning to read chunks of a page at once...you  mentally divide the page down the middle, and then horizontally 5 times or  so.  Kaplan says that with practice you will be able to comprehend meaning  from words within sentence read out of order.  Maybe...for me, it has  worked only on VERY easy texts, and then my comprehension was hardly  outstanding. I certainly wouldn't pleasure read like this. To be honest,  though, I haven't practiced this technique all that much.  <br />Is it really  possible to read at 3000 wpm?  I don't know.  I haven't met anyone who  does.  Kaplan says that within a month, though, you should be able to read  at least 1,500 wpm...I've been practicing speed reading for a couple  months, and I'm sure as hell nowhere near that range yet. And I read a lot.   <br />Still, this is not a bad book.  I think it will be especially useful to  younger students...serious high school and junior high students, for  instance.  It is straightforward, and easy to read.  Kaplan cuts right to  the chase, without wasting time exploring &quot;mind science,&quot; as so  many accelerated learning books do.  Success will not come without a lot of  work, though.	2000-06-24

Using multiple voices, Matthiessen tells the story of E.J Watson, a homesteader in the turn-of-the-century  Everglades.   Matthiessen tells the story in the 1st person, from the point  of view of various friends of Watson, family members, and enemies within  the Chokoloskee community.  <br />Matthiessen has clearly immersed himself in  the lives of Florida pioneers, and conveys the harshness of their lives,  and that sticky, fetid overripeness so characteristic of Florida,  brilliantly. He clearly loves his players, and adeptly creates  &quot;whole&quot; people in even distasteful characters.<br />I've bought this  book for friends who haven't been able to finish it...I have no idea why.   Too much MTV, I guess, has rotted their attention spans!  It may take 20 or  so pages to get used to the shifting voices, but it is far from a difficult  read, and you will find yourself compelled by the narrative.<br />This book  has two sequels:  Lost Man's River (told from the perspective of Watson's  grown son), and Bone by Bone (told from the p.o.v. of Watson himself).   Both are worth a look.	2000-06-22

I have been practicing &quot;PhotoReading&quot; regularly since writing the last review, and I can say with confidence that PHOTOREADING IS UTTER NONSENSE.  The gimmick, that  actual PhotoReading portion of the &quot;whole mind system&quot; is a  brief, but utter waste of time.  <br />Recognize that ALL these  &quot;accelerated learning&quot; gurus HAVE to come up with some sort of  gimmick to distinguish their brand of uselessness from all the others.   PhotoReading is Scheele's gimmick.  I tried his techniques in one of my  graduate classes, and you simply don't get the detail from the text that he  claims you do by PhotoReading, and &quot;dipping and skimming.&quot;  <br />No  matter what these hucksters promise, there is simply no substitute for hard  work.	2000-06-22

Christians today, having been indoctrinated by whatever demonination they have aligned themselves with, live comfortably within the unity of their own sect's dogma, presuming that the New Testament lends  this dogma unquivocal support.  This sort of tunnel vision is certainly  true of Catholicism, in any case--*my* sect.<br />Dunn's book examines early  Christianity, and reveals a broad--a shockingly broad--range of beliefs and  practices among early Christians, and he bases his examination on an  analysis of the New Testament itself.  He begins, for instance, by  revealing the different &quot;kerygmata&quot;--or messages--among Jesus,  Luke (Acts), Paul, and John, and how each emphasizes something different  about Jesus, promotes, as it were, a different agenda.  For instance, in  the synoptic gospels, Jesus preached repentance, proclaimed God, and  presented himself, often subtly, as an apocalytpic figure.  Paul, however,  says nary a word about repentance, and instead of proclaiming God, he  proclaims Jesus--the exalted Jesus.  He shares Jesus' apocalyptic vision,  believing that the parousia is just around the corner (as Jesus did). Both  Acts and the Pauline epistles barely touch on the historical Jesus.<br />There was a fairly wide range of worship, too.  Paul, for all his  ranting, was remarkably tolerant of different beliefs.<br />Dunn examines a  wide range of diversities within early Christian communities, and in doing  so presents a very good introduction to the New Testament, and one that is  a far more interesting read than a survey might be (for instance Raymond  Brown's Introduction to the New Testament).<br />The one thing I found  annoying about this book--and it is, in my opinion, a problem with many  theological works--is a tendancy to cite chapter and verse without actually  quoting it.  There are far too many scriptural citations to quote them all  in this already thick-ish book, but certainly in each group of citations,  at least one representative quotation could be given.  It is VERY annoying  to have to CONSTANTLY stop to look up citations, and after a while, I found  myself simply not doing it.<br />This is a scholarly book, not a feel-good  book book on spirituality.  It makes demands on the reader, but it is very  well organized, with subheadings and numbered paragraphs, making it VERY  easy to preview a chapter and make notes.  This was my preferred way of  reading this book, in fact...I would preview the chapter, and jot down an  outline based on the subheadings , and then fill that outline in as I  plowed through the body of the chapter.  Dunn's presentation of a great  deal of information, in other words, is very accomodating.one representative quotation could be given.

I saw this book several years ago and, on a lark, bought it (no, I'm not a devil-worshipper).  I suspect the authors are drop-dead serious, which is why I gave it only  one-star.  If they mean this as an elaborate joke, I'd give it...3-1/2  stars.<br />I rather enjoyed the case histories--demon invocations that went  badly...Curiously, no reason is ever given for why one would WANT to invoke  something bad, rather than something good.  After all, the authors don't  seem to use these demons to curse other people, or cause harm.  There seems  no point...other than to make maladjusted mediocrities feel like powerful  and dangerous bad-boys.<br />And, in the end, that's all that's  here--Hyatt's typical dimestore philosophizing &amp; iconoclasm.  There  isn't anything groundbreaking here, although some of the grimoire excerpts  are interesting cultural artifacts.<br />I rarely get rid of books, but this  one (along with one of Hyatt's Tantra books) did not seem worth even the  meager space it was occupying on my bookshelf, so I dumped it.	2000-06-17

I'm beginning to detect a pattern in these so-called &quot;accelerated-learning&quot; books.  For one thing, their authors seem to be using them to greater or lesser degrees as platforms from which to  hawk their seminars and mail-order courses.  For another, they all have a  gimmick.  For instance, Tony Buzan's is &quot;Mind Mapping,&quot; Paul  Scheele's is &quot;PhotoReading,&quot; Wim Wenger's is &quot;Image  Streaming&quot;...and Rose's/Nicholl's is Acronyms.  Sometimes these  gimmicks work--as in the case of Buzan's--and sometimes they're pure snake  oil (PhotoReading).<br />I wouldn't go so far as to call this book snake  oil...but I also wouldn't go so far as to call it useful, either.  There is  very little fresh, useful information here.  I have found better  information in other books (try Buzan's--his books also smack of  hucksterism, but they *do* contain some useful information and techniques).  Aside from the &quot;learning maps&quot; technique (that is, Mind Mapping),  there is very little here that will seem like more than very basic common  sense to even the most mediocre of intellects.  In other words, if you're  absolutely helpless when it comes to learning, this book might help.  If  you're hoping, however, that this book will help you more readily absorb  material in your graduate Victorian Poetry seminar, forget it.  <br />This  book is heavy on background information--research, sanitized for lay  people.  The instruction the give in analytical thinking is laughable.  My  impression is that the target audience is for the most part  corporations...and I have to ask, &quot;Do they really think business  executives and secretaries are so stupid?&quot;  Here's their  &quot;learning strategy&quot; for problem-solving:<br />D efinition<br />A  lternatives<br />N arrow Down<br />C hoose and check the consequences<br />E  ffect<br />Then they go on to expand on these hard-to-grasp concepts.  Much of  the book consists of this type of pablum.<br />Thefront cover declares that  this book will help you &quot;Master a foreign language with ease.&quot;   Guess what their instruction consists of...An ENTIRE CHAPTER devoted to  peddling their language course.  That's it! Unbelievable!  They devote  several more pages at the end of the book to peddle their program,  too.<br />This is a TERRIBLE book.  Anyone who says otherwise is probably  working for the publisher! You've been warned.	2000-06-14

If you only  have an acoustic, and still want to learn  blues lead guitar, just replace  your wound G string with an unwound G string, so that you can do the bends.   Unless your acoustic has a cutaway, you won't be able to play all the  exercises with the very high notes, but you can certain play many of  them.<br />This book covers the basics of blues guitar in a thorough fashion.   All the exercises use major and minor pentatonic scales, with some  variations, but you can do A LOT with them.  The exercises range from  straight blues, to jazzy blues, to country blues.  Sokolow provides  notation and recordings for both the leads and the rhythm.  I spent many  hours practicing his exercises, which are actual breaks, not tedious scale  exercises, which you often find in &quot;speed-pickin'&quot; books.  <br />I  can't recommend this book enough for beginning guitarists.  You'll have a  lot of fun with it.	2000-06-11

This book lines up the various pericopes from each gospel in parallel columns, so that  their rendition in each can be compared.  This allows readers better to  discern small, subtle differences among them, and to determine more easily,  for instance,  who used what source, redaction, theology, and so  forth...for instance, Q material is readily apparent when you see that  Matthew and Luke contain identical material that isn't present in Mark, and  to see this, you don't have to flip back and forth from one gospel to  another, because they're all lined up for you, side by side.  <br />One  confusing thing about this book is that there is notational nomenclature  our the kazoo, which isn't very well explained.  For instance, you will   notice that the Gospel names at the head of each column is occasionally  bolded.  Sometimes all of them are.  Sometimes they're bracketed.  I  couldn't find anything in the book to explain this.  Had my seminar prof.  not explained them, I'd still be in the dark.<br />That said, the text is well  referenced.  This isn't a &quot;study&quot; guide, so it isn't glossed, but  it is footnoted with plenty of relevant citations.  Dubious text--or text  that is widely accepted as having been added by later copyists--is  footnoted...for instance, the &quot;sweat like blood&quot; verse in Luke's  rendition of the Gethsemane pericope.  <br />For anyone embarking on a serious  of analysis of the synoptic gospels (and John), this book is a great tool.	2000-06-10

The first was Douglas Day's biography--a sort of psycho-literary look at Lowry's life.  It's not bad, but Bowker's book goes far beyond Day's.  This  book is much richer in detail--detail that casual readers might find  overwhelming, but that Lowry afficionados will wallow in.  <br />Also, Bowker  has tracked down Lowry's first wife, Jan Gabriel, who adds to the story of  Lowry's life a dimension absent from Day's book.<br />Anyone who has read  Lowry's work has certainly suspected that his art mirrored his life, that  much of what he wrote was autobiographical, in spirit if not in detail.   This book confirms those suspicions, showing how truly excessive Lowry was  in pretty much all aspects of his life:  his drinking, fear,  childishness...<br />A great biography of a great writer.	2000-06-04

This modest little book is about one thing: Speed Reading.  You aren't bombarded with sales pitches (or pseudo-mystical  mumbo-jumbo) like you are in the VASTLY overpriced Photoreading Whole Mind  System book by Paul Scheele.  <br />Zorn is an educator--Scheele, Tony Buzan,  Howard Berg and Marcus Conyers...these others are hucksters. Buzan's books  are helpful, but his tendency is to try to make too little go too long a  way, primarily, one suspects, to promote his &quot;brainpower&quot;  business.  <br />This slim little book effectively balances useful reading  exercises with practice texts (mercifully brief).  Zorn covers all the  basics--regression, phrase reading, recognition rates, concentration,  comprehension, &quot;superreading&quot; (5,000 wpm and above) and so on.  There are NO wild promises, no sales pitches, no fancy jargon. If you can  only get ONE speed reading book, get this one.  <br />What this book doesn't  have--which some of the others do (at the expense, I should add, of  practical speed reading instruction)--is instruction on learning  techniques.  That's a different cup 'o meat, though, in my opinion; you can  get one of Buzan's books dealing with Mind Mapping if you want to improve  study habits.  I'm sure there are others out there, too...I just don't know  what they are.<br />Zorn has written a modest, straightforward, helpful book.   I'd hate to see this go out of print while so much junk (like the  PhotoReading Whole Mind System) continues to remain in print.	2000-06-04

Too often, space is wasted on fruitless stabs at wit, or superfluous information.  This is precisely the problem  with &quot;The Complete Idiot's Guide to Improving Your Memory.&quot;  The  first half of the book is devoted to a thin gruel of scientific background  and sometimes-interesting anecdotes, all of which could have been  compressed into about a quarter of the space.  In this respect, the book's  title is somewhat misleading, because slightly less than half the book is  actually devoted to memory-improving techniques.  The publishers, though,  apparently desire the &quot;Complete Idiot's&quot; line of books to share  identical dimensions, which means we, the readers, have to dig through much  unnecessary padding on our ways to the core content.<br />When, after many  pages, the book does get on track, the memory enhancement techniques are  pretty standard stuff--not bad, but not exceptional, either.There's a  chapter on memorizing speeches, and techniques for memorizing faces and  names, lists, and dates.  Not all of this seems terribly useful, either.   It seems far more expeditious simply to write a list down than to spend the  time implementing hook-and-peg memory techniques.  Memorizing dates will be  useful to students, and quickly matching faces with names will help  politicians (at least those without a vast staff of underlings to keep  track of such things for them), but, really, there isn't all that much  useful stuff here.  If you want to learn material--not just lists, but  information--Mind Mapping techniques (see Tony Buzan's Mind Mapping books)  are probably more appropriate.<br />The for-dummies-and-idiots genre can be  useful for rank newcomers; they often gather much information from a wide  range of sources into one volume, but they do so in a distinctly  superficial manner, and, as is the problem with this book, they do so  without providing adequatefocus.	2000-05-21

More than half of this book consists of &quot;practice&quot; texts--and, of course, you can practice on any book you happen to be reading.<br />There are a *few* useful exercises, which  include reading two lines at once, then 5, then whole paragraphs, then  whole pages.  You can't read like this for comprehension; the authors have  you do it to get used to scanning segments of text at once , rather than  single words. Another exercise has you read for one minute for  comprehension, another minute at double that speed, and another minute at  triple.  These exercises DO help, but as far as speed reading instruction  goes, that's it.  Really.  <br />There is also some very basic instruction on  memory-enhancement techniques, nutrition, posture, previewing texts, and so  forth--standard stuff.  <br />In short, this book is a waste of money.  Tony  Buzan's book &quot;Speed Reading&quot; is far better.  Some of the older  speed reading books offer far more in the way practical instruction than  this book does. &quot;Double Your Reading Speed,&quot; published in 1964 by  The Reading Laboratory, comes to mind.	2000-05-19

After I first looked at the book, I thought it was the most cockamamie thing I'd ever heard of, but then, perhaps more from hope  than common sense, I began to change my mind.  It seemed like there might  be something to it...that, in theory, it *should* work.  So I got the  faith, so to speak, and plunged in.<br />The basics of PhotoReading are simple  enough: you preview the text, page through the book rapidly, while  maintaining an unfocused gaze at the pages (thus  &quot;nonconsciously,&quot; as the author puts it, photographing them), let  it incubate for a while, then skim the book, and, if necessary, go back and  speed read it.  Very broadly, that's it.<br />Right there, it should be  apparent that what is giving you a grasp of a text's contents--if anything  is--are the repeated trips back into the text, not the hoodoo-ism of  PhotoReading itself.<br />I've tried it.  I have not received any benefit  whatsoever from the PhotoReading itself, although, of course, repeated  trips back to the text have been helpful.<br />One way the author is able to  assert that you can read 25,000 words a minute is by, in fact, urging you  NOT to read them.  He maintains that only 4-11% of a text contains useful  information.  REALLY!  I don't know what kinds of books he reads, but the  books *I* read are hardly so much fluff!<br />The author seems to give himself  a back door, too, in case you can't get PhotoReading to work for you.  If  PhotoReading doesn't work for you, it's because you care about the outcome.   No kidding.  In other words, for instance, graduate students who have a  pile of books to cleave through should not worry about this...otherwise it  won't work.  That's like saying, &quot;Don't think about a green  banana&quot;--the first thing you think about is a green banana.  Of course  people are going to be concerned about their mastery of a text...if they  weren't, therewould be no need for it, and the very people who MOST need  to be able to PhotoRead will be least able to make it work.  <br />This is a  slim paperback, and an overpriced one at that.  There is a measure of  slick, salesman-like smarminess to it, too.  For instance, the back cover  loudly proclaims, &quot;Includes a free coupon for two powerful audio  tapes, _Memory Supercharger_ and _Personal Genius_.&quot;  Okay, cut to the  coupon:  Immediately, you see that, literally, the COUPON is free (as most  in this world are), and that the tapes are FAR from free! Furthermore,  throughout the book, and for 7 full pages at the end,  Paul Scheele is  peddling his other services.  <br />All this notwithstanding, there is *some*  useful information here.  As an introduction to memory/learning techniques  like Mind Mapping, it serves as an adequate introduction.  PhotoReading is  not any substitute, however, for true speed reading.  I will continue to  work at this, though, just in case...and if I change my mind about this  technique, I will retract what I have said here with the same stridency  with which I am offering it now.	2000-05-10

Contrary to the title's suggestion, this book is not merely about the Lions of Tsavo.  In fact, both lions are dispatched fairly early in the book.  Nevertheless, Patterson's account of their carnage, and efforts to  kill them, are detailed and exciting, and probably unlike anything that  will ever be written again. <br />This book is also gives a micro-social look  at British imperialism in Africa around the turn of the century...an  interesting slice of Africana, especially through our arguably  hypersensitive, politically-correct modern eyes.  <br />Generally, an easy  read, filled with local color, hunting, and excitement.	2000-05-03

I kept the book, though.  Hauser, an academic, and a Jesuit priest, shows how to make comtemplative prayer not just a part of life--a part of one's day--but how  to *integrate* into one's life.  He bases his technique on the exercises of  St. Ignatius, and at the end of each chapter, includes several questions  for reflections.  <br />His advice throughout is concrete and practical--this  is not a book of esoteric theology.  For instance, in the chapter entitled  &quot;Obstacles to the Spirit,&quot; he identifies bad moods as one  obstacle to the Holy Spirit, and describes 5 courses of action the  contemplative can take to overcome that obstacle.<br />Overall, well-written,  direct, and concrete, with plenty of specific examples.	2000-05-03

She's an important feminist writer if for no other reason than that she appeals to a certain portion of the movement, but her ideas tend to the hateful, and the  extreme.  Beyond doubt, she loathes men--her hatred coats the pages like  slime, and her ideas will only find homes in the hearts of people already  predisposed to this extreme brand of resentment.  She seems--really!--to  believe there will come a time when women can reproduce without men...at  all!  <br />For Mary Daly, western Civilization is characterized it seems by  one thing--savage patriarchy.  Men, she claims in various ways, are Nazis.   She seems--really!--to believe there will come a time when women can  reproduce without men...at all! Men will be superfluous.  <br />What Daly does  have going for her, though, is the crazy, eloquent zeal of the  well-educated fanatic. Her writing is lyrical, even when she's snarling.  Were I scoring her on her writing alone, I would give her full marks, but  since this is, primarily, an idea book, and since her ideas are, well,  hateful, and horribly biased by her owned sad encounters with &quot;the  patriarchy&quot; (she was denied admission to PhD theology programs in  America, and had to go to Europe to obtain that part of her education), I'm  compelled to score her down.<br />A crazy book by a loony writer, but a heck  of a fun read if you don't take it seriously!	2000-04-09

Can a perfectly good God create a world in  which so much evil exists?  Is God powerless to control *all* evil?  What  role does human freedom play in moral evil?  The author examines these  persistent questions in language easily accessible to a lay person.  <br />He  also examines the &quot;meaning&quot; of the Book of Job. It isn't saying,  by any means, simply &quot;Keep the faith an you will be rewarded.&quot;   Instead, it is a commentary on mankind's--the sufferer's--relationship to  God, and the nature of faith.  <br />A good book.	2000-01-19
US	51977423	RF156M2MMQSSC	052143971X	899384141	Practical Ethics	Books	4	56	66	N	N	A Very Good Collection of Essays	Peter Singer's views are very controversial--his recent appointment at Princeton was vigorously protested by various groups--but they certainly make for an interesting read.  <br />He espouses utilitarianism, a branch of  ethics that measures &quot;rightness&quot; or &quot;wrongness&quot; on an  action's effect on the majority of people (and animals).  As a result,  there is very little voice given in defense of certain rights that many of  us--especially us Americans--consider to be fundamental (except, of course,  to refute them).  The individual is of little importance in his scheme of  ethics, and his brand of utilitarianism, based on a rigorous logic, leads  to some pretty scary destinations.  For instance, in his argument in favor  of animal rights, Singer argues that a) speciesism is no different from  racism, that our perception of a difference is no less illogical and  unethical than our one-time perception of an ethical difference between,  say, men and women, or blacks and whites; b) that intelligence is no basis  for dermining ethical stature, that, for instance, the lives of humans are  not worth more than the lives of animals simply because they are more  intelligence (if intelligence were a standard of judgment, he points out,  we could perform medical experiments on the mentally retarded with moral  impunity); c) that we need to measure the *interests* of the parties  involved, and that, ultimately, all things being equal, an animal has as  much interest in living as a human.  Therefore, all things being equal,  medical experimentation on animals is immoral.  If, however, sacrificing  the lives of, say 20 animals will save millions of human lives, then all  things are not equal, and the interests of millions of people outweighs the  interests of 20 animals.  The horrifying extention of this principle,  though, is that the interests of 20 people outweighs the interests of one,  and that this philosophy will give the green light to all sorts of very  profound civil rights abuses.<br />The arguments aren't impenetrable, but  singer is very careful in setting them up, and very good at getting the  reader to agree with him before the reader really knows what he is agreeing  with.  His arguments are strong, logical, and convincing (which isn't to  say I agree with all of them).  <br />He makes an interesting, very strong  case for the ethical necessity of vegetarianism (simply:  it is wrong to  kill as a matter of tase; we don't need to eat meat, and therefore kill to  do so only as a matter of taste; therefore it is wrong to eat meat).  He  also argues in favor of abortion &amp; infancticide.<br />This is an excellent  book for lay people interested in secular ethical reasoning.	2000-01-19

He tends to be somewhat psychobabble jargony, and as a result often lapses into abstraction, but his technique of homing in on a chart's key points--the points of  developmental tension--is remarkably accurate and useful. This book is  huge, with gobs of information and examples.  The prose is often clunky,  unwieldy, but the information is great.<br />He addresses a wide variety of  topics in this book, including career profiling, sexuality, health, and  prediction.	2000-01-19
US	51977423	R15KBKY0D35BRY	0060654058	659031933	Catholicism: New Study Edition--Completely Revised and Updated	Books	5	112	146	N	Y	An Excellent, Accurate Survey	If you're expecting merely another cathecism of this book--as often people are--you'll be disapppointed.  If, however, you want a sound, accurate, and scholarly survey not just of Catholicism iteself, but of the environment in  which it grew, and continues to exist, this is a great book.  McBrien, a  priest, and professor of theology at Notre Dame, objectively examines many,  many spiritual and theological forces at work within and without the  church, since its inception through the present day.  These forces,  naturally, include many Protestant, and even secular influences.  At the  end of each section, McBrien provides useful lists for further reading,  should you want to explore certain ideas further.    Yes, McBrien is a liberal theologian, and no, I am not theologicall liberal.  Far from it.  But this book is not like the editorials he writes for that left-wing Catholic rag National Catholic Reporter.  He doesn't use the book as a platform to advocate for gay marriage or gun control or an end to celibacy among clergy--all of which (and much more) NCR does, and loudly.  I read some of the negative reviews here and I have to wonder if these people are reacting to the book, or to what they already think about McBrien.  What they seem not to realize--and what McBrien does--is that Catholicism is more than just catechism.  Sure, if all you want to know is church doctrine, read the catechism.  If you want a deeper look into the history of church doctrine and theology, and the environment in which is has existed and currently exists, though, read this book.  It is a work for thinking Catholics.  Everyone else should stick to their catechism.	2000-01-19
US	51977423	R5QVKZNZNK3ZA	1572810319	324434608	Mini Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck & Book Set	Books	1	9	18	N	N	Ridiculous	This deck is simply horrible.  There are a few creative innovations with the symbolism (for instance, the skin-shedding snake depicted on the Death card), but most of the deck is childishly simplistic at best, dreadfully  bigoted at worst.  The creators seem to think that womanhood cannot be  celebrated without manhood being utterly denigrated.  The authors despise  civilization (all of it, apparently), characterized throughout as a  patriarchy built on, and enforced through \\"insitutionalized rape.   \\" And so on and so forth. Throughout the deck, men--qua men--are  pointedly characterized as violent, brutal, and oppressive.     This may be  politically correct bigotry, but it is bigotry nontheless.  If you can look  at someone else's deck/book, do so,  because it's unintentionally  funny--good for a chuckle, but not worth shelling out any money for.       The artwork--perhaps meant to appear primitive (as though hearkening  back to the salad days of some imagined pre-patriarchal Utopia, maybe?)--is very  childish.  Some cards are downright disgusting.  I wouldn't even line a bird cage with these cards.	2000-01-18
