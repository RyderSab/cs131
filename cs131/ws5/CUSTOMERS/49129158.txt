That being said, it is a remarkably thoughtful and penetrating examination of the theory and practice of loving.  Many of Fromm's observations are astute, and his concerns re narcissism and consumerism in the search for a mate are even more cogent today (witness reality TV's \\"Who wants to marry a millionaire\\" and \\"the bachelor\\", e.g.).  Most people I know could learn something from this book.  Be forwarned, though...it is not a quick or easy \\"self-help\\" read, and Fromm's advice, which is to behave altruistically, is not easy to follow, either.	2003-01-08

It's easy to be moved to tears as she chronicles a father denying paternity, a close friend's death, and the frustrations of a colicky baby.  But she never loses her sense of humor and her keen observations are a welcome respite from so many memoirs which are all sweetness and light.	2002-07-10

Barbara Kingsolver takes us through three interconnected stories involving nature, the environment, flora and fauna, and human relationships, and unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find the clear analogies between the human drama and the rest of the green earth too preachy or overwhelming.  I enjoyed her lyrical prose, her unmatched descriptive powers, and the slow-moving but satisfying resolution of the plotlines.  Perfect reading for a slow summer afternoon.	2002-07-10

She's entertaining, has a sense of humor that the hardships of her past has not diminished, is a talented writer, and aspires to be a &quot;useful citizen.&quot;  This is a perfect girls' fantasy with a storybook ending, and has held up over time remarkably well.

And yes, Ms. Ehrenreich brings her own personality, prejudices, and experiences with her in her forays into low-wage jobs.  However, I think that is an asset, not a detriment to the book.  I think as a society we're often loath to face uncomfortable truths, and the great truth she illustrates for us here is the sheer ugliness of capitalism.  Marx did point it out for us a long way back, but he's not an easy read.  Dickens did too, but the industrial revolution seems a long way away in the 21st century.  Now, anyone with any background in economics can point out that companies need to keep costs down, that a &quot;living wage&quot; would put many small businesses under, the connections between capitalism and freedom, etc., etc.  But sometimes I think we need a harsh look at reality and the indignities and struggles just to have food and shelter that many, many people in this country face on a daily basis.  Ms. Ehrenreich doesn't purport to solve the problems she describes here, but she has done us a great service by making her readers think long and hard about the inequities and injustices in our country.	2001-08-12

It demonstrates that there is plenty to laugh about in the study of philosophy.

We don't know our own history, and although in 2001 we take for granted the ideas that women can be professional athletes or CEOs, that families are not all alike, that equal pay for equal work is fair and right...these ideas were once radical, and not that long ago.  Likewise, in the 1970s universal suffrage was taken for granted...and the struggles of women activists in the 1920s were forgotten.  This is a valuable collection of writings which gives us some of that history back.  It covers important feminist thought from 1949 to 1993.  This book holds important lessons for all of us, on religion, rape, health, pornography, family, race, sexual orientation...all manner of relevant and fascinating work.	2001-07-20

She's got a wonderful sense of the ridiculous and a sharp wit, yet her writing appears to have true and great affection for her fellow women and men.  This book isn't her best though. It's a collection of previously published essays, some of which have stood the test of time better than others.

The Vietnam War and why it is left out is covered at length in the book. Second wave feminism is another topic of incredible importance to youth today, and yet it is not in the curriculum except in gender studies; Professor Loewen doesn't make as much of this issue, but it is a good starting point.

It is a rather entertaining series of mini-essays attempting to put the elaborate, extravagant, and expensive spectacles that  weddings are becoming into a reasonable perspective.  I read it while  engaged and found the author's perspective on what is and is not important  a helpful reminder.  For example: the wedding day is not all about the  bride; the wedding is not a fundraiser; the wedding is not a time for  networking; the wedding is not for the entertainment of all present, but a  ceremony uniting two people in marriage; weddings should be in good taste,  etc.  Seemingly obvious points, but yet, many involved seem to miss them!   <br />However, if you're going to plan a large wedding, a how to guide is  actually much more useful.  And if you're dealing with horrid fights with  your family or your in laws, or both, no book can help you--unfortunate as  that may be!	2000-07-27

The author proposes that a new definition of family be legally adopted to  reflect practice and need, rather than traditional notions.  She uses the  mother and child model (this a metaphor for the nurturer and dependant  individuals, whatever their age or gender) rather than our idea now that  the sexual tie between husband and wife is the tie that binds.  So, rather  than giving tax breaks and inheritance rights and the myriad of legal  advantages to protect a family on the basis of marriage, Martha Fineman  proposes that the same advantages be provided by our society to a single  mother with a child, or a man in his 30s taking care of his elderly  parents, or a woman who lives with and supports her developmentally  disabled brother, etc.  It is really a completely radical idea, but it is  argued persuasively.  If she can't convince you, she will at least make you  reconsider the assumptions one makes about families and their legal rights  and responsibilities.	2000-07-27

Books	2	3	3	N	N	Thought-provoking	An interesting book, which examines a 1992 Canadian court case concerning  Aboriginal ceremonies from a variety of perspectives: colonialism,  nationalism, feminist theory, etc.  Although the questions and ideas raised  are interesting, reading the book is a bit frustrating.  I found myself  wishing for more factual information, more details about the case itself,  more information about what had happened, but instead practically buried in  analysis.  I also think that the author's political motivation was much  more concerned with the fate of Quebec than of the native peoples, which  struck me as somewhat disingenuous.  Additionally, I think the author owes  more to Foucault than he credits.  However, I found it worth reading, if  simply to force myself to question some of my assumptions about law,  sovereignity, and individual rights.	2000-07-19
