I thought I was  going to have a stroke or a heart attack. Well, I found that the cliff  notes provided me with a wealth of information about the plot, characters,  summaries, and background information. Now that i'm older, I've found that  Ivanhoe is truly a literary classic and should be read by everyone.  However, the cliff notes will give you enough information that you won't  have to read the book in a high school English class. For all you lazy high  school students out there I guess this is really good news for you.	2000-08-20

After reading this book, I believe that Phyllis  Ann Karr has produced the definitive source for the legend. Whether her  entries are on specific people, weapons, or ancient artifacts, they are  detailed enough to provide a wealth enough information that any true fan  would enjoy. I highly recommend this book.	2000-08-20
US	51051828	R254Q8K18CVBHJ	1569800774	479892592	The Complete Book of Devils and Demons	Books	3	14	17	N	N	Fascinating but hard to follow	The book is a good reference point for those looking into this subject for  the first time. While the author provides a lot of information, her style  in presenting it leaves something to be desired. The book format is put  together in such a way that it makes it difficult for the reader to follow.  There are also a lot of errors in grammar like misspelled words and run-on  sentences. It seems the author would have noticed this, but I guess he was  in a hurry. If you can live with the format then you may want to check it  out. However, you may want to try &quot;Encyclopedia of Hell&quot; by  Miriam Van Scott.	2000-08-20

The use of alien  vocabulary was different, but i found it easy to understand. Also, with the  many characters in the book, it was good to have a reference guide at the  beginning so we could keep track of all the characters. The authors do a  remarkable job of developing the characters throughout the book, which  allows the story to develop smoothly. I did feel that the ending was a  little rushed. Other than that, you probably will enjoy the book even more  after you read it the second time.	2000-08-20

Chester the raccoon shares these same fears with his mother. She responds  by kissing his hand and telling him that now her love will always be with  him. This is a great book for parents to share with their young child  before they go to school. It will really help make the transition easier  for the child. Highly recommended!	2000-08-20

Problems include medicare, social security, welfare, the war on  drugs, high taxes, and defense spending. All these programs are flawed or  they aren't worth the amount of funds that are going into the program. Its  interesting to see that the Democrats and Republicans really don't have too  many differences except for increasing the budget with wasteful spending.  Browne's ideas are fascinating, but its a shame that the media won't give  him a chance to express his views.	2000-08-20

However, the book left me with an ill feeling. How can Morris put a fictional character in the book to tell a life story? It makes  no sense for a respected author to do this. The fictional accounts take  time away from what the author should have been talking about in the first  place. I'm sure no sane author would have done anything close to this  travesty...	2000-08-20
US	51051828	RVSYXRN0W0Q6L	0451521943	259828480	Ivanhoe (Signet classics)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A literary classic	The book deals with Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe returning from the Crusades to  claim his inheritance and his love for a Saxon princess, Rowena. Throughout  the novel, we are shown the struggle between Richard the Lion-Hearted and  his brother John, introduced to Robin Hood, the reasons for the hatred  between Saxons and Normans, and discrimination against the Jews. The  majority of characters are intelligent and beautifuly written. Even with  Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, even though he is one of the major villans, the  reader is left with a sense of sorrow because he also loves Rowena. Highly  recommended!	2000-08-20

I found the evidence presented in  the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient Jewish sources, and Christian tombs, to be  both enlightening and accurate. Once again, Grant R. Jeffrey gives  Christians a book that can only strengthen their faith.	2000-08-20

The author seems to think that the threat that some people in the West believe comes from radical Islam is overblown. He does do a good job  explaining his arguments in great detail. Chapter 2, &quot;Islam and the  West,&quot; is a good overview of some problems between the two cultures. I  believe anyone interested in this topic would find that chapter pretty  fascinating. However, terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the  PLO; terrorist extremists such as Isama bin Laden; and terrorist states  such as Iran, Iraq, and Syria wish for the destruction of Israel and the  &quot;Great Satan&quot; (U.S.) Therefore, its pretty obvious that radical  Islam is a threat to the West. With biological, chemical, and nuclear  weapons available on the black market, the threat has only increased.	2000-08-19

The novel takes place 1000 years before  the Ban War, which fans of his other novels will appreciate. We finally get  to know more about Aravan, the Hidden Ones, and the conflict between the  good and dark mages. While some readers may find Mage Alamar to be a little  annoying, I think he provides needed comic relief and he interacts well  with the other main characters. Overall, this is an excellent novel with  many plot twists and should be read by anyone who considers themseves fans  of fantasy fiction. <br />For anyone who reads McKiernan's work for the first  time, I would also recommend &quot;The Iron Tower Trilogy,&quot; and  &quot;Dragondoom.&quot; Dragondoom is probably the best novel on the world  of Mithgar.	2000-08-18
US	51051828	R1MLD4CONCPU3T	1888848219	928669278	Apocalypse Code	Books	5	4	8	N	N	A great book on Bible prophecy	Apocalypse Code is probably the book you want to buy if your interested in  the Book of Revelation and end-time prophecy. Lindsey describes the various  aspects of the Book of Revelation in great detail and he writes in a way  that is pretty easy to understand. He also relates many aspects to the  world we live in today. By doing this he shows the reader that he has  extensive knowledge of international affairs. This, in my opinion, gives  the book more credibility. The book should appeal to any Christian who is  interested in spreading the gospel to those that are lost. Highly  recommended!	2000-08-18

The novel is full of action and its  fun watching the characters trying to find ways of defeating the Saudi  prince. The Prince reminds me of Osuma bin Laden, which is probably why I  like this book so much. However, I do find it hard to believe that the main  characters can escape so many dangerous situations when the villans are  high-priced terrorists and Stasi agents.	2000-08-18

He transforms Patrick McLanahan into Frank Castle. If you  don't know, Frank Castle is the Punisher from Marvel Comics. The book is  full of high-tech weapons, drug dealers, gun battles, biker gangs, and a  man obsessed with revenge. I believe that fans of the Marvel Comic will  find a lot to like about this book, but true Dale Brown fans will pray that  he switches back to the type of novels we have come to expect and enjoy.	2000-08-18

He offers  different opinions about where the Ark could be, then he settles on  Ethiopia. I commend him for the amount of research involved in writing a  book of this nature, but there are doubts to whether the Ark is actually in  Ethiopia. I also believed, as a previous reviewer stated, that he spent too  much time talking about the Knights Templar. However, I believe anyone who  has any interest in this topic, or simply enjoys a good detective story,  will enjoy reading this book.	2000-08-13

The first part reviews the campaigns, naval operations, casualty  lists, and chronology of the different fronts. The second part reviews the  weapons and tactics from both sides. And, the third part, which is truly  amazing, the author gives detailled reports on all the nations involved.  The author obviously spent a great amount of time researching all the  information required for the novel. The novel should be highly recommended  for anyone interested in this dark period of our history.	2000-08-13

The novel ties  up all the loose ends and prophecies from the previous novels. Bair was a  great character and McKiernan did an outstanding job of developing him and  his relationship with Aravan. I found the idea of Bair questioning Adon's  previous actions quite fascinating. I only wished McKiernan spent more time  discussing that aspect of the novel. Also, the section in the novel where  Dalavar spoke to and tried to convince the dragons to switch sides was  classic. Its sad to think that this may be the last novel about Mithgar. I  pray that McKiernan will decide to write at least one more.	2000-08-13

He backs up his claims with research into Bible prophecy and  other areas that allow him to present his points clearly, while offering  valuable insights for each chapter. The sections on Daniel's prophecy and  the future Great Depression are excellent and allows readers to open their  eyes to a number of possibilities. While some readers may find his  suggestions on financial strategies for the future a bit complicated, I  found these arguments insightful and worth looking into. As always, Grant  R. Jeffrey doesn't disappoint his fans.	2000-08-13

The politics and intrigue of the great houses and alliances of Kelewan are  fascinating. It reminds me of the political intrigue and power struggles  that were conducted in ancient Rome and Greece. We learn more about the  Great Ones, the Cho Ja, and why the Emperor decided to invade Midkemia.  <br />The novel is full of great characters such as Lady Mara, Keyoke, Jingu  of the Minwanabi, and Arakasi. The Cho Ja are fascinating creatures and i'm  glad their role is expanded in the other two novels. The characters'  development throughout the novel are done very well which allows the reader  to develop a certain attachment for them. This is what makes the novel so  hard to put down.	2000-08-13

James Sanders does a great job researching the material for this book and his  arguments are clear and to the point. Its scary to think the government  could actually cover-up anything like this, but if you remember the news  conferences the government gave they changed their story at least four  times. For example, the military confirmed there were missile tests in the  area then this story was changed to avoid criticism. Also, there were  around 200 witnesses that saw a streaking light going towards the plane  before it exploded. The government gave many reasons for this, with the  best being electrical currents from power lines, and even tried to  discredit all the witnesses. Sanders talks about this and many other  examples that readers will find both fascinating and scary at the same  time.	2000-08-13

These guns include smoothbores, sharpshooters, repeaters, and  several others. Joseph Bilby's research into the historical aspect of each  weapon is excellent and worthy of praise. Bilby also provides an invaluable  supply and information list near the end of the book. Collectors will find  this part of the book very helpful for locating pieces to add to their  collection.	2000-08-13

Afterall, this is the flagship of the  Federation were talking about. Books 1 and 3 focus on the Enterprise crew,  and they are probably the best the series has to offer. The plot is  excellent and John Vornholt does a fantastic job with all the characters.  Its good to see Ro Laren playing a part in the novel. She was always a  fascinating character in the series that the writers should've concentrated  more on. After reading books 1 and 3, I wished Paramount used this  storyline for the last Star Trek film. Instead, we got the usual garbage on  screen. In any case, if your a fan of Star Trek, especially the Next  Generation, then you will love this novel.	2000-08-13

Al Gore would have to deal with an imploding Russia and a resurgent China  with an expanding military. In this novel, the President has to deal with  these issues and he fails miserably. His mistakes costs the lives of  millions of Americans as the United States is faced with a devestating  nuclear attack. After this, the novel really gets interesting.<br />Eric L.  Harry does a great job of describing battles, detailing the political  aspects of all the governments involved, and creating characters that are  complex enough that the reader will find the novel difficult to put down.  Of all the World War III novels that are being written, this is perhaps the  best and most exciting novel on the market today.	2000-08-12

When you  look at the world today, you see countries like North Korea, Iraq, Iran, or  even terrorists like Osuma bin Laden that have the ability to create  biological weapons that could devestate populated regions around the world.  The novel is so true to life that I can now see why CNN and the New York  Times ran pieces that said the book was dangerous. People need to  understand that a biological attack will probably happen in the near future  somewhere in the United States. &quot;The Cobra Event&quot; describes one  scenario that could very well happen. Hopefully, people will now begin to  take notice of this possible danger.	2000-08-12

He retells each battle in stunning detail, and allows the  reader to delve into the minds of the soldiers and civilians involved in  the conflict. Carlton uses a brilliant list of primary sources and  quotations which further expand the overall effectiveness the book has for  the reader. This book should be highly recommended for any student of  English or military history.	2000-08-12

After reading this book I would have to say no. The author gives  many examples in the Bible and tries to relate the translations to the  modern world. However, the author does a very poor job in arguing his point  throughout the novel. The argument is so poor that it makes me wonder if  the novel was just a scam to get money from Christians who were paying  close attention to the year 2000. I would recommend spending your money on  another novel.	2000-08-12

Humans, elves, dwarves, warrows, and the rest of the  armies of light struggle against the armies of darkness which include  vulgs, dark wizards, cold-drakes, and the almost impossible to kill guuls.  Here we first learn of the Ban War and the conflict between Adon and  Gyphon. While the trilogy is similar to the Lord of the Rings, this in no  way should diminish the importance this book, and the rest of the books  about Mithgar, has on the fantasy genre. McKiernan shows readers that he a  great storyteller and each book he writes only improves and expands on this  wonderful saga. Highly recommended!	2000-08-12

I recently read &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; and I will have to say that  this is one of the best books i've read in years. The characters are  believable and you get the impression that you are actually there with  them. The novel rivals Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; and the  &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of books that portray the end of the world.  I highly recommend this novel.	2000-08-12

These first hand accounts are remarkable and  somewhat chilling at the same time. For example, there are accounts that  talk about the success of the German military in Europe, and accounts that  describe the Russian front in great detail. I found the accounts on about  the Russian front to be very disturbing. The soldiers suffered through many  ordeals that its amazing they survived at all. Overall, this novel would be  a welcome addition to anyone's library.	2000-08-12

The topics range from the conflict in China to the  dropping of the atomic bombs. The book allows the reader to understand the  reasonings behind specific actions by soldiers and the mindset of both  civilians and soldiers throughout the war. Reading chapter 15,  &quot;Special Attack,&quot; was truly frightening. For anyone who wanted to  know why the Japanese Kamikaze pilots felt they should give their lives for  their country, then this is a chapter that must be read. Overall, an  excellent book that needs to be read for those interested in this vast  topic.	2000-08-11

He covers topics relating to military, social, and economic  issues, which allows the reader to develop a full understanding of the  various aspects of the war without having to read a book that is several  thousand pages long. I found chapter 9 to be extremely helpful because it  talks about the economic aspects of both the Southern and Northern  economies. What really sets this book apart from the countless Civil War  books that come out every month are the bibliographical essays at the end  of each chapter. They help the reader gain a better understanding by  examining different topics that go along with each chapter, and by  suggesting and discussing different books the reader may want to examine.  This is truly an impressive work on Civil War history and any history buff  will enjoy it.	2000-08-11
