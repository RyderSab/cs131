US	46254038	R1IOVX0W6C4ANJ	0670032646	621157776	American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush	Books	4	69	83	N	N	Thought provoking and nuanced	American Dynasty is a thought-provoking and well-researched book.  Unlike the polemical works by Al Franken or Michael Moore (or their conservatives counterparts such as Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh etc.), Phillips presents a nuanced and deeply disturbing look at American politics today.  Phillips points out that no one, on either the Right or the Left, is completely clean and that our political system has become extremely corrupt and tilted toward special interests.  But Phillips (a Republican) reserves his greatest criticism for the Bush family which he says has engaged in a disturbing and deeply consistent pattern of deceit and deception.<br />Reviewers who charge that Phillips is unfair and that he engages in character assassination against Bush cannot have read this book very closely.  Phillips points out similarities in behavior between Bush, Clinton, Johnson, Nixon, Kennedy and Reagan.  His point, however, is that the Bush family has engaged in more egregious and more consistent patterns of deceit than these other presidents (he provides specific and very detailed evidence for this).  He also acknowledges that dynasties are becoming more common in American politics overall but he argues, and convincingly so, that the Bush family has been more aggressive (and more successful) in building and maintaining a family dynasty than the Kennedys, the Clintons and other political American families.<br />In general, the book is well-written, although a bit dry.  It's not a book which you will read in one sitting.  However, the chapter divisions make this an easy book to pick up and put down.<br />The best chapters were, I think, the chapters on Texas economics and the growth of the Religious Right.  The Texas economics chapters is frightening-here is a state and culture which boasts some of America's richest citizens but where there is a reluctance to share or spread the wealth.  The results are disastrous-Phillips doggedly demonstrates the impact poor health care, poor schooling and a lack of social services have had on the state of Texas.  Reading this one can only hope that Texas does not set a pattern for the rest of the US.  The Religious Right chapter was equally chilling.  <br />Overall, the discussion of George H.W. Bush was the most illuminating.  Bush created and maintained deeply misleading stories about who he is and what he has accomplished with his life.  The myth of the Bush family presents a sharp contrast to the reality.<br />My one complaint: I wish that there had been a greater discussion of the ties between the Bush family and the Saudis.  I appreciate the discussions of the Bush connections to Enron etc. and there was some discussion of the connection between the Saudis and the Bush family but this needs to be discussed in greater detail. <br />As an historian, I also had some minor quibbles with his discussions of monarchies and their restorations (specifically his discussion of the Stuart Restoration).	2004-02-23
US	46254038	R1IEXPJWCFWAEU	0316734500	36886929	The Bookseller of Kabul	Books	4	153	158	N	N	Fascinating	Sierstad has written an outstanding book---her writing is lyrical (or at least the translation is!) and the subject is fascinating. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, Sierstad never claims that her family is representative of the Afghani people (in her introduction, she notes that she picked the Khan family because she found them and their stories compelling---she says, however, that the family is by no means typical as they are literate, middle class and urban).<br />That said, the book does provide a penetrating look at a complex and complicated family forced to live under horrific conditions.  Within the context of his society, Sultan Khan is an enlightened and liberal man.  No fundamentalist, he reads widely and believes in freedom of thought and speech.  But for all that Khan is a liberal man in a conservative society---he is still a product of a highly conservative society.  As such, he is a polygamist and a man who forces his sons to bind to his will.<br />Khan is not a likeable man but his story, which the author tells in great detail, goes a long way in explaining who he is and why he acts as he does.  As a bookseller, Khan was tortured first by the Soviets and then by the Taliban.  Not surprisingly, he seeks, above all, to protect himself and all he owns (which for him, includes his family) from the ravages of war.  This means, of course, that Khan forces the members of his family to do his bidding (his sons are taken from school and forced to work in his businesses etc.).  <br />Khan is a despot.  His actions toward his two wives, his children, his siblings and his nephews all reflect his desire to control his fate in a society which has allowed him no control over his own life.  That doesn't excuse him, of course.  As a westerner reading the book (and as a woman), I was appalled by Khan's horrific treatment of his wives---I found it fascinating that Khan could easily reject those aspects of Islam which he found demanding (praying five times a day) while adhering to those which work to his benefit (polygamy and the right to a teenage wife when he is in his 50s).<br />The book isn't a simple man--bad, woman-good type of book.  Look closely at the female characters (Khan's mother is as much a despot as Khan himself is)---their lives are equally complex and they are deeply nuanced individuals.  On the flip side (and this can't be denied), women in Afghanistan suffer under the hands of men.  <br />I strongly recommend this book!	2003-12-02

An excellent study of the evil women do.<br />    Batsheva, a young widow, moves into a very small Orthodox Jewish community in Memphis.  As an unmarried woman and a stranger, she is instantly the subject of gossip and speculation. As a convert, her enthusiastic love of Judiasm is suspect---in a community where ritual and rigid obedience to the law has replaced a love for religion and/or God.<br />     The women in the community are highly individualized and therefore, easily recognizable.  They are women we all know and they can be found everywhere in Amrica.  There is a Mrs. Levy (the gossip who always begins everything with &quot;I don't want say anything bad BUT...&quot;) in every community---just as there is a Helen (the woman who blindly follows others because she is afraid to discover who she really is), a Tzipporah (a woman convinced of her righteousness) and a Rena (a woman struggling to hide her own secrets).  The characters are fantastic.<br />     Buy this and share it with all the women you know.	2003-10-17

That said, I don't think the book is simply a story about the Chassidic world.  It's a story about a closed community and the desire of some of its members to remain in the closed community while others push at and seek to explore the unknown world outside the closed society.  There are innumerable parallels to this-for me, having a mom who grew up in an extremely rigid immigrant community and whose mom rebelled in a big way (going to college in the 1940s, marrying &quot;out&quot; and marrying someone of a different religion-a WASP whose family came here in the 1630s), the story was really insightful (made me understand my mom and her choices in a new way-and why many people from her childhood still see her, 40 years later, as a dangerous rebel).  But it also provided me with insights into some of the closed societies to which I have belonged and the reluctance of the members of these grps to acknowledge the validity of the lives of those outside the society.<br />Abraham writes well and the characters are well-drawn and highly complex people (with all sorts of contradictions within themselves).  This was a book I literally couldn't put down.  I strongly recommend it!	2003-08-15

Miles Roby is trapped as the manager of a caf√© in Empire Falls, Maine-years before, he dropped out of college when his mother was dying and now he remains in Empire Falls as his daughter, Tick, is finishing high school.<br /> Miles' entrapment is, to some degree, of his own choosing-he has allowed himself to be manipulated by his shiftless father, his conniving ex-wife, his jealous neighbor and the town's wealthiest woman.  He lives a life in which he seeks to satisfy others-and, as a result, he has never really found satisfaction or pleasure (with the exception of his love for his daughter).<br /> This is the first Russo novel I've read-and I was amazed by the lyrical writing.  Russo reminds me of Anne Tyler (who also writes about the disappointments and inner lives of people who appear, on the surface, to be completely ordinary).  I can't recommend this book highly enough.	2003-07-10

There is no excuse for shoddy research and angry screaming polemical diatribes such as Coulter writes.  I am prepared to extend Ms. Coulter the right to her own opinions (although she and her kind seem reluctant to extend this right to any one who opposes her) but she does not have the right to claim her book is factually based.  It is not-take it from one who knows (I possess a PhD in American history from one of the country's leading universities).<br />What disturbs me the most abt Coulter and her work is not the lies which she perpetuates but rather the division she is bent on creating in this society.  Regardless of my political leanings, I find myself deeply upset by her screeching &quot;treason&quot; at those who oppose her.  Liberals, it might be remembered, are the ones who brought you civil rights, ensured that women had the right to vote, and brought you the New Deal (which has benefitted every American-with the exception of the upper-classes-and Coulter herself is a member of the latter group-she is from Greenwich, one of the wealthiest suburbs in America).  These actions are not exactly treasonous.  To call liberals (and people like Cleland or Kerry who, unlike George W. Bush, actually fought in Vietnam) treasonous is really unforgiveable.  I can only hope that Ms. Coulter is sued for slander---and soon.<br />Give this book a miss.  Read anything but this book.	2003-07-09

His books vary widely (from his light and amusing art history/mystery series to the much more serious and scholarly An Instance of the Fingerpost).  The only thing that's a guarantee when picking up one of Pears' books is that it will be a great read-and The Dream of Scipio is no exception.<br /> The book is an in-depth examination of three moments of crisis-the fall of Rome, the collapse of Europe during the first onslaught of the Black Death and the height of World War II.  All three moments forced ordinary-and extraordinary-people to make difficult moral decisions.  The stories Pears tells focus on the lives of three men-all of whom see themselves as bearing the torch of civilization at a time when civilization is in danger of collapse. Because these men see themselves as intellectuals and set apart from the rest of humanity, they believe that the choices they make are justified-but ironically, the choices Manlius, Olivier, and Julian make reveal the weakness of humanity.<br /> As an historian, I was fascinated by this book.  Pears really does get everything right (a rarity among historical novelists) but in addition to that, he makes us uncomfortably aware of how our choices can and often do have consequences beyond our intentions.  More than many historians, Pears provided me with a deeper understanding of how and why anti-Semitism, or even more simply, hatred of outsiders, has flourished throughout history.  A depressing but really thought-provoking book.	2003-07-08

Prose is a great writer and she clearly knows academia-its petty squabbles and the overarching belief of its members that only universities and colleges provide a sanctuary for the mind.<BR> <BR> The main storyline deals with Ted Swensen, a novelist turned professor.  Swensen teaches a creative writing seminar where he encounters Angela Argo.  Argo is a gifted writer but a deeply troubled kid (as is every adolescent-take it from someone who taught college kids for four years!).  Argo lures Swensen, first with her writing (which Swensen, who is suffering from writer's block, finds incredibly exciting) and then ultimately with her body.  Not surprisingly, Angela, who seeks only her own advancement, turns the tables on Swensen and reports him for sexual harassment.  In the highly politicized college environment of the 1990s, Swensen is given a (not so fair) trail and then watches his life fall apart.<BR> <BR> As a feminist, I cannot praise this book highly enough.   I am extremely liberal but I was deeply disturbed by the divisive and often troubling politics which have come to characterize most college campuses-and Prose does an outstanding job of demonstrating the dangers of excessive political correctness (which can, at heart, be as dangerous as McCarthyism, the Salem witch hunts etc.).	2003-07-08

This book completely fulfills the promise of J.K. Rowling's earlier books.   Despite tremendous pressure, Rowling has delivered-yet again.<br /> The work is darker and more layered than her earlier books-in part, b/c Harry is growing up and in part, b/c Harry's readers are growing with him.  Although Rowling pulls off the difficult task of writing on several levels (different elements of her story appeal to adults, children and adolescents), the book will have an especially strong appeal to 13 year olds b/c they are just beginning to experience the agony of adolescence.<BR>  <BR> And agony it is.  What impressed me about this book was how developed Harry is and how real the difficulties he encounters are.  He deals with the usual-Voldemort-but he also must face the realization that even those whom he loves may have very real flaws.  This is a concept which often baffles adults and Harry's struggles to deal with the fact that his father may not have been perfect really rings true. <br /> I was also really impressed by the way in which Harry must face death.  This was incredibly real-his absolute rage and feeling of impotence (I say this as an adult who lost her own father while an adolescent).  I hadn't thought I would but I cried when I read this section.  <br /> Overall, I can't recommend this book highly enough.  Despite the sadness (and Harry's anger) which permeates the story, I loved the story-and I will always love Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and Diagon Alley.  I just wish I could visit them and explore them even more but I guess that's a wish shared by everyone who reads these books.  <br /> One final comment: I feel frustrated by reviewers and commentators who seem dismissive of Rowling's accomplishments.  So many of these adult reviewers seem to be ignorant of mythology, the history of magic and English literature, especially Jane Austen's books (I love the incorporation of Mrs. Norris from Mansfield Park).  As an historian of science who taught a college class onthe history of magic and science, I love all of Rowling's sly references to real-life alchemists, astronomers etc. and I am amazed by the way she incorporates these so smoothly into the text.  Her knowledge of mythology is equally impressive-and the references are fantastic if you only know where and how to look (read a basic book on mythology, guys!).  <BR>   <BR>     And for critics who believe that Narnia or Middle Earth are better places to visit...give me a break!  As a child, I found Narnia to be incredibly Victorian and silly (and the children to be hopelessly priggish).  As far as Tolkein goes, his characters are not as well-developed as Rowling's and his self-conscious fashioning of his imagined world is so heavy-handed that it can make reading the books a burden.  Rowling has a much lighter touch and her characters are very real!	2003-06-24

The idea that there are competing strains/versions of Christianity and that the official church (the Vatican) has acted to destroy or at least suppress the truth is an old one but Dan Brown uses this idea to great effect.<br /><br />  The characters are interesting and the plot moves very quickly---this is a real page-turner.  Brown constantly leaves you guessing and you are never sure who is on the side of the hero and heroine and who is opposed to them.<br />  I loved the interaction between Langdon (the hero---a Harvard professor) and Sophie Neveu (the heroine---a Parisian cop and cryptologist).  The action in the book occurs over abt a day or two and Sophie and Langdon's relationship is true to this.  Many thrillers have the hero and heroine fall madly in love within a 24 hour period as they are being chased by bad guys---this is pretty unrealistic!  Brown doesn't fall into this trap.  His characters have only just met and they maintain a professional and very real relationship throughout the book (no sex on the run).<br />  My only complaint (and it's very minor) is that Brown doesn't include a \\"Historical Footnotes\\" page.  I wanted to know what was true and what was not true in the book!<br />  Buy this---and reserve a day to read it.  It goes very quickly and you won't regret it!	2003-06-06

As his starting point, Hendrickson uses a photograph of several Southern sheriffs posing with a billy club just days before the riots at the U/Mississippi in 1962.  Henrickson then explores the lives of these men and their descendants in the New South.<br />    To claim that the book is &quot;southern bashing&quot; is grossly inaccurate.  Hendrickson explores and speaks with many Southerners-and in doing so, he points out the differences in experience (there is no one Southern experience).  Hendrickson also explores the different ways in which people of similar backgrounds reacted to the Civil Rights Movement (he looks at white southerners who supported the Civil Rights Movement as well as those who disdained the movement-proving that southerners had many options and that not all white southerners are the  bigots which we Northerners traditionally associate with the South).  <BR> <BR>         I was especially struck by the great job he does of demonstrating the love which many African-American Mississippians have for their state (there is sometimes a tendency to see those who define themselves as Southerners or Mississippians as primarily white men-but the conflicted and tortured feelings which many African Americans have about their state, its beauty and its past are an important component of the state's history and present).  <br /> The saddest aspect of the book for me is the tendency of most Mississippians to glorify and distort their past.  Mississippians have an incredible past-and one they can be proud of-if we are talking about Faulkner, Wright, Welty, the rise of the Civil Rights Movement (which consisted of blacks and whites) etc.  But the tendency of many Mississippians to glorify the plantation past or even the supposedly more innocent eras of the 1930s and 1940s (when blacks were forced to step off of sidewalks when passingwhites, when they lived in constant fear of lynchings etc.) is really troubling.<br /> Southerners need to confront their past (ironically, the Germans have done a better job of doing this)-until they honestly do this, there can be little hope that they can move forward.  Some of the individuals in the book seemed to be making an honest attempt to think about and confront the uglier aspects of their state's past and this was really moving.  However, the tendency of many others to brush aside the past was troubling.  <br /> Overall, I strongly recommend this book-it is well-written and incredibly thought-provoking.	2003-04-23

The mystery is good-it's genuinely unclear who has been killing women in the area around Cater Street. And the characters, at least in this novel, are actually somewhat realistic. Charlotte, her heroine, is a bit tedious in her self-righteousness but Thomas Pitt, the inspector who is investigating the murders in the neighborhood in which Charlotte lives with her parents and sisters, is a good foil. He is straight-forward, unapologetic and seems curiously immune from the usual fallout created by the Victorian class system. I especially liked Emily, Charlotte's younger and highly ambitious sister. The Ellisons, Emily's and Charlotte's family are genteelly middle-class but Emily intends to marry up-and she manages to achieve it-even as the world in which the Ellisons live falls apart when a killer begins stalking the Ellisons and their neighbors....	2003-04-09

Andy, Sylvia's adult stepson, has also been enlisted to help in the restoration.<br />    Since her accident, Meg has suffered from auditory hallucinations...but while at the farmhouse, Meg suddenly begins to experience visual hallucinations.  At first, she dismisses them as the result of her accident but when it becomes clear that Andy is seeing the same &quot;hallucinations&quot; both Andy and Meg are forced to acknowledge the unthinkable---the house is haunted.<br />    Barbara Michaels is an incredibly gifted writer of suspense/ghost stories.  She combines the ordinary with the extraordinary---most of her heroines are skeptics which make their experiences with the supernatural even more chilling.  You know that these are not the fanciful people who would see ghosts wherever they are.  In fact, these are the people who will deny the ghost's existence until the last possible moment.  <br />    As an historian, I love the research Michaels puts into her books (and she makes it seem effortless!).

Elizabeth Peters is one of the best writers around.  Her books are consistently funny-her plots are fantastic, the characters are people you want to meet and the settings/background are consistently interesting.<br /> Trojan Gold features Vicky Bliss-an art historian who is, to her chagrin, a beautiful buxom blonde (she wants to be respected for her brains, which are formidable, not her beauty).  Vicky is a curator at a Munich museum where her boss, Schmidt, is an equally renowned art historian (but one who wants to be respected as a great detective-he's more Santa Claus than Sherlock Holmes).  Vicky's sometime lover, &quot;Sir John Smythe,&quot; is equally renowned-as a great art thief.<br /> The three of them come together in a frantic search to find Schleiman's lost treasure, the gold from Troy.  This has been missing since 1945-when it disappeared in the collapse of Berlin.  The search leads Vicky, John and Schmidt to an Alpine village (where they encounter several of Europe's and America's foremost art historians-all searching for the same thing).  Just a note on historical background: the gold went missing in 1945 and it was relocated in the former U.S.S.R. after its collapse (Trojan Gold was written before 1989).  <br /> It's hard to say who is the best character-Vicky, John (who really is every woman's fantasy of the perfect lover) or Schmidt.  The relationship between the three is great (Schmidt is deeply enamored of &quot;Sir John&quot;-whom he does not know is an art thief) and the dialogue will leave you in stitches.  <br /> Do not miss out on this one!  It's truly great-one of the best books Elizabeth Peters has ever written (and that is saying a lot because she is a fantastic writer!).	2003-04-08

The characters are wonderfully drawn and while it is true that the plot is not quite as intricate or complex as some reviewers claim, Lovesy tells an interesting story-one you will be able to devour easily in one or two sittings.<br /> The False Inspector Dew focuses on a series of characters-Alma who has fallen madly in love with her dentist and who has persuaded him to kill his rapacious wife; the dentist, Walter Baranov, who is swept up by Alma's passion and agrees to kill his wife at Alma's behest; Jack Gordon, a card shark who has located his mark and intends to fleece him on a boat trip across the Atlantic; Barbara, a wealthy girl whose mother is scheming to marry her off; and a millionaire's son who is conveniently both single and interested in cards.  All of these characters come together when they decide to cross the Atlantic on the Mauritania in 1921.  When a murder occurs, Walter Baranov (who is traveling under a false name so that he can more easily kill his own wife) is called upon to solve the murder.  In the character of Inspector Dew (the man who arrested Dr. Crippen), Baranov acts out the fantasy of every murder mystery lover-he becomes a detective and sets out to solve a real crime.	2003-04-08

Ruth reluctantly agrees to host a dinner party/seance which will feature a famous medium.  Ruth and her guests who include Sara's anthropology professor, Pat, do not believe in ghosts but the seance stirs up old memories in the house.<br />    Sara becomes possessed by the spirit of Ammie---a young girl who lived in the house during the Revolutionary War.

The characters are real and the absurd situation in which they find themselves also seems surprisingly real.

While Newman does an amazing job at recreating twelfth-century France, the best part of her books is  that she never cheatsher characters are very much products of medieval society.  Newman never has them endorse modern views just so that the reader will be able to relate to the character.<br /> That said, Heresy is not Newman's best book (but the level she sets is really high so a weak book by Sharan Newman is the equivalent of a great book by other historical murder mystery writers).  I love the characters Newman has created.  Catherine, her heroine, is the daughter of a devout Catholic woman and a Jewish convert.  Rampant anti-Semitism means that  Catherine keeps her Jewish roots hiddenbut she has close ties to her Jewish relatives.  For me, this is one of the most fascinating parts of Newman's worksthe inter-play between the Christian and Jewish worlds of medieval France.<br /> Newman's primary interests tho' are with the range of Christian belief in medieval France and her murder mysteries often deal with heresy, the threat of heresy or heretical groups.  This book is no exceptionthe lead character is the son of Heloise and Abelard.  Suspected of murder after consorting with a group of heretics, Astrolabe is on the run and he turns to Catherine and her family for help.  <br /> The tensions in this mystery were not as strong as they could have been (I was less interested in Astrolabe than I was in the other characters).   If you've read Newman's other books, you'll probably enjoy this one but if you are new to her work, try reading A Difficult Saint or any of her earlier works first.	2003-03-07

Her books are quick, fun and interesting to read.  You won't be sorry you picked this one up.<br /> Courting Trouble focuses on a new recruit to the all-woman law firm of Rosato and Associates.  Anne Murphy seems to have it all-beauty, intelligence, ambition and a bright future.  Her only fatal weakness seems to be a desire for nice clothes and a tendency to put it all on her credit cards (a weakness any woman can understand!).<BR> <BR> Her life is not, however, all that it seems.  She has fled to Philadelphia to escape a stalker and she is entangled in a complicated legal case which is not what it appears to be on the surface.  While taking an unexpected vacation, she opens the paper and discovers that a young woman, believed to be herself, has been killed in her apartment.  With the help of Bennie, Mary and Judy (her boss and fellow associates), Anne decides to remain \\"dead\\" in an attempt to smoke out her killer.  This is where the book really comes together.  Scottoline really understands women's relationships-while all four women become close in the course of the investigation, they remain very different people, driven by different motives and characterized by both affection and jealousy for each other.<br /> Scottoline's works aren't just about interesting characters and relationships though.  She also does an outstanding job at creating and maintaining suspense.  It is never clear until the very last pages of her book who the killer is and why he or she has committed murder.  There aren't many writers who can maintain this kind of suspense right up to the very end.<br /> Don't miss out on this or any of Scottoline's other works.	2003-02-12

A young woman has been accused of murder and kidnaping a child.  The accusations begin with a series of anonymous letters and quickly escalate as bodies are discovered and it becomes clear that the child the woman claims is her son cannot possibly be her own.<br /> This story is given an extra twist-Rutledge is haunted by the ever-constant presence of his former, corporal Hamish Macleod, who died under his orders during the war.  The young woman accused of murder and kidnaping is Hamish's fiancee.  Solving the mystery may, or so the reader hopes, help Rutledge deal with his own guilt over Hamish's death and his-Rutledge's-survival.<br /> My only complaint with this series is a minor one-Hamish is sometimes too stereotypically Scottish.  He constantly speaks in dialect (interestingly enough, Todd's other Scottish characters do not speak in dialect) and he seems at times to veer on a stage version of a Scotsman.  This may be intentional on Todd's part (after all, Hamish is a part of Rutledge's memory-and as such he isn't real) but it can get annoying after a while.  <br /> That said, I still recommend the book strongly.  You won't be sorry you read it.	2003-02-12

Unlike To Say Nothing of the Dog or Bellwether, Passages is very serious (much more similar to The Doomsday Book).<br />       Johanna is a cognitive psychologist who teams up with a neurologist to invesitage near death experiences.  I'm not a fan of New Age things or discussions of near death experiences and so the premise of the book did put me off reading it for a while.  But because I have liked Willis so much I gave the book a chance and I'm very glad I did so.  It is excellent---it avoids all of that syrupy silliness which usually characterizes books about near death experiences or even sudden death (and thankfully it also avoids the gushy hysteria which often characterizes novels set in hospitals and ERs).<br />      Johanna's experience as she delves into death is fascinating---it's very rare to read a book and not be able to guess at what will come next but Willis manages to pull it off. So while it is true that the book can be, at times, rather wordy, I was never really tempted to put it down.  In fact I began it on the metro ride to work and had a difficult day focusing on my job I was so tempted to sneak off and read!<BR>   <BR>     This is not for the weak of heart but I strongly recommend it!	2003-02-11

Save an evening to read this as you won't want to put it down once you've started it.<br />     In Bellwether, Willis brings together a sociologist studying fads and a chaos theorist (who seems immune to fads).  Both work for a nameless faceless corporation which seems to thrive on chaos itself---even as it searches for a way to control and manipulate its workers.<br />     The main characters are wonderful as always (as always, Willis has created a wonderful heroine---a mix of savvy and naivity).  But it is her minor characters who keep you laughing--Flip, the assistant who makes everyone's lives a nightmare, the mothers at a birthday party for pre-schoolers who are driven by discipline fads, and even the faceless and nameless Management.  <br />      Don't miss out on this!	2003-02-11

Unfortunately, this book isn't up to her usually high standard.<br />    The book is a sequel to When Christ and His Saints Slept and deals with Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine (always a great subject for historical fiction).  Penman does a good job of bringing her characters to life but somehow the plot doesn't really work and, much to my surprise, I had a difficult time finishing this book.  <br />     One of the greatest weaknesses of the book was her focus on her own fictional characters, Ranulf (Henry's uncle) and his blind Welsh wife, Rhiannon.  Ranulf's story of divided loyalties (is he Welsh or Norman?) should make for a great story but Penman never manages to create and maintain this tension.  In fact, Ranulf and Rhiannon's story became less interesting to me as I read on in the book.<br />      The book would have been more interesting (at least to me!) if she had focused on Eleanor and Henry---and their incredible relationship.  Even if she had focused solely on Henry's political ambitions and struggles the book would have been a better read.  <br />       Buy this if you are a serious Penman fan but otherwise give it a miss and read her other books instead (esp. The Sunne in Splendor).	2003-02-11

Read this for the mystery-but don't expect anything else.<br /> The main focus of The Deadhouse revolves around the murder of a professor, Lola Dakota.   Setting this in academia could have provided Fairstein with a lot to write about and rich characters to explore.  Unfortunately (and I say this as a former academic), Fairstein seems to be completely clueless about how universities really function-and how divided academic disciplines are.  Even at an experimental school, very few professors work across disciplines.  As a medical historian, I was also insulted by Fairstein's bizarre assumption that an archeological dig would include a political scientist and a biologist.  Historians and anthropologists would slit their throats before they allowed people with such different approaches to walk near an archeological site.  Academic politics are characterized by a surreal number of turf battles (ironically, these battles-among people who essentially do the same thing-would have provided a much more interesting backdrop for the novel).<br /> Along the way, various different sex crimes occur and one gets a glimpse into the problems and issues which confront D.A.s working on sex crimes.  This is always the most interesting part of Fairstein's novels and I would have preferred it if she followed several of these stories all the way through.<br /> I also have a peeve with Alexandra.  She is perfect-perfectly bland-and I find myself annoyed by the fact that Fairstein always likes to keep her at the \\"perfect\\" age for a single woman-36.  Why can't she age?  Why is she always virtuously eating salads?  Why does Jake like her?  There is nothing real about this woman.  She's a piece of cardboard.  The other characters are poorly developed as well (including Lola-she's a non-academic's silly idea of what a maverick academic is).<br /> Read thisfor the mystery-which is, as always, interesting but if you are looking for characters to care about, skip this one.	2002-11-22

It's extremely lively, well-written and a great deal of fun---and it makes you think!  I'm actually an historian and I'll confess---very few historians write history as well as Horowitz does and very few will ever have the impact he has had.  At countless academic conferences, I have heard historians mumbling jealously about this book---all of them envy it and wish they had written it.<br />    Despite being a deep-dyed-in-wool Yankee (or maybe because I am a Yankee), I thought this book did a fantastic job at explaining who we are as Americans and why we have had such a difficult time escaping from the legacy of the Civil War.  While the book is very funny (I loved the stories of the Civil War re-enactors---esp. the ones who practice the &quot;bloat&quot; of malnutrition), it is also rather depressing.  As long as Americans (both those north and south of the Mason-Dixon line) cling to this silly idea of a &quot;grand old South&quot; complete with Tara, gallant Confederates and so on, we will never really be able to deal with our racial problems.  <br />      Horowitz's visit to a school where he discovered that the children knew nothing abt their past but clung to the old prejudices anyway was something I will never forget.   It does an incredible job of illustrating how the historical myth often becomes more important than the reality.<br />      My one great hope is that the popularity of the book may cause people to re-think all of those cherished and silly myths we have about the South.  Let's face it, guys, Ashley Wilkes was a slave holder.  Not exactly the qualifications I look for when assigning the role of gentleman!	2002-11-20

Tec is a gifted writer and her comments about her experiences are deeply insightful.<br />     Tec was hidden during the war---disguised as a Polish Christian, she lived with a variety of families before settling with a working-class family who also took in her parents (neither of whom spoke Polish well enough to \\"pass\\") and her sister.<br />     What is most interesting (and depressing) about Tec's story is her slow realization that the family who took her in was anti-semetic.  As a child, she experiences deep confusion about this and wonders how she should feel when the family compliments her by telling her that she is not \\"like a Jew.\\"  Her conflicted feelings about this family (she grows to love and respect them while at the same time being appalled by their prejudice) illustrate one of the greatest paradoxes regarding prejudices (***).  The sad truth is that when one looks behind the stereotype one always discovers individuals who defy the stereotype (Tec herself experiences this---she assumes that one of the woman who takes them in---Stella--is a typically stupid and lazy member of the working class but when Stella is tortured by the Nazis and refuses to eveal any information, Tec is forced to look beyond the stereotype todiscover a very real and very complicated individual).<br />     Tec's story also explores an aspect often not found in books dealing with adults under the Holocaust.  As a hidden child who could \\"pass\\" as a Polish Christian, Tec spent her days as Krysia, a Polish Gentile.  Not surprisingly, this caused her to become deeply confused about who she was---like all pre-teens and adolescents, Tec was struggling to discover her own identity but unlike her peers, Tec was forced to hide this identity.<br /> I have read a great number of Holocaust memoirs---and this is not the \\"typical\\" memoir (as far as one can say there is a \\"typical\\" memoir).  Several factors make this book unique---Tec's age at the time of the Holocaust, her insights into her own experiences (not surprising as Tec later became a scholar specializing in this period) and her openness about her struggle to assume an identity at a time when she was forbidden to assume her true identity.	2002-11-20

But, as it quickly becomes clear, the search for the bishop's bird stump isn't really Ned's mission---altho' just what Ned's mission is is never clear.<br />    After returning to the future without the bishop's bird stump, Ned is sent back into the past yet again.  But this time he's wandering (quite literally) around the Victorian era---searching for a lost cat and trying to ensure that the proper Victorian miss, Tossie, meets the right man on the right date.  Problem is Ned doesn't know what the right date is or who the right man is.  Adding to all the confusion are proper (or improper?) butlers, eccentric Oxford dons, spiritualists, lovesick undergraduates, apoplectic colonels, scheming matrons...and one very interesting young woman who hails from Ned's time as well.<br />Sound confusing?  It is!  But it's a wonderful tangle---if you have ever read Victorian novels, murder mysteries or even just visited Britain, this is a book you'll really enjoy!	2002-11-20

Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed.  <br />     The book has an outstanding premise---as a child growing up in Australia during the 1960s, Brooks was eager to experience the outside world.  An avid letter writer, she found pen-pals in the U.S., Israel and France.  As an adult, Brooks set off to meet and re-discover these people.  So far so good.  But the book peters out---with the exception of the American pen-pal (to whom she was closest), the characters lack enough detail to be interesting.  <br />    Her meeting with her French pen-pal was especially disappointing.  This was a girl who chose to remain in her native village (while Brooks became a world-traveler and global correspondant).  I hoped for more insights and more discussion of the contrast and why they chose such radically different paths---despite coming from somewhat similar backgrounds (Brooks saw herself as living in a giant provincial village---the village of Australia).  But there was little discussion and the meeting simply sounded painful.  Her trip to Israel to meet her non-Jewish Israeli pen-pal would also have benefitted from a deeper discussion about one's choices and opportunities (there was some discussion of this but I wanted to know more).<br />     Had I not read Brooks' other books, I probably would have thought this was a fairly good book.  But I know she can write such a better book!	2002-11-20

While Jake manages to find Lena, his attempts to persuade her to join him become hopelessly convoluted when she insists on finding and notifying her husband of her decision to leave him.  Lena's husband, it turns out, was a rocket scientist/mathematician who worked for the Nazis and who is now the target of a concentrated search by both the Russians and Americans (who want not to try her husband but rather to exploit his knowledge of weapons and missles).  <BR>     While Russian and American intelligence are courting former Nazi scientists, Nazi and Nazi sympathizers who lack valuable knowledge are being systematically put on trial by both the Russians and Americans.  The parallel story of Renate, a Jewish Berliner who worked for the Nazis as a \\"catcher\\" (someone who identified and caught Jews for the Nazis while under threat of death) presents an incredible counterpoint to the story of Lena's husband. <BR>     This is not a book which you can easily put down---the writing is great and the story moves along quickly.

Living as she does in a period when historians can and do travel to the periods which they study, Kirvin requests permission to travel to the Middle Ages---a period rated as highly dangerous and generally forbidden to time travelers.  She ultimately receives reluctant permission to travel to the past---specifically the period just before the Black Death of 1348.  As is to be expected, problems occur with the \\"drop\\" and Kirvin winds up in a small village just as the Black Death appears.  Meanwhile, back in her own time period, a dangerous and devastating epidemic breaks out.  <br />      As a medical historian, I was really drawn to this book.  There are a few minor errors in the book (most dramatically in Willis' complete lack of knowledge regarding the diseases which were common in medieval Europe---these were plentiful but they were not cholera, smallpox etc.).  But this is a minor quiblle (and probably stems from the fact that I know way too much abt medical history!).  <br />     The real heart of the book is Willis' depiction of societies beset by unknown and killer plagues.  The medieval part of the story is really well-written---the characters were fascinating and their plight seemed incredibly real (the modern part of the story isn't half as interesting).  I found myself flipping over the modern sections of the book to get to the medieval story---this story had incredible drama and Kirvin's reactions to the plight of the villagers (even her reactions to their daily life) were fascinating.  <BR>     Despite the weakness of the modern section, I would still recommend this book.	2002-11-14

The Oracle Glass does a wonderful job of re-creating the world of seventeenth-century Paris where magic and science were uneasy bedfellows.<BR> <br />The story focuses on Genevieve, a young girl who pretends to be an aged crone (very aged---she admits to being well over a 100!). Genevieve works for the famed witch, Catherine Montvoisin but she is also a follower of the new philosophy (science). <BR> Underneath the persona of an aged wise woman and fortune teller, Genevieve remains a young girl. And like all young girls, she is in love---first with a conceited fop and then, finally (!) with a man who is her intellectual equal and who loves her more than he loves himself.<BR> <br />This is the kind of book which you will love to read late at night (preferably a cold winter's night). There is a touch of the supernatural in the story---but it is Riley's mastry of the romance novel which really makes this book great reading for late at night!	2002-11-14
US	46254038	R2ANUNW34H8MK	0345448898	731430286	His Dark Materials Trilogy: The Golden Compass / The Subtle Knife / The Amber Spyglass	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Amazing and Incredibly Original	Pullman is one of the most gifted fantasy writers of the 20th century.  Unlike Tolkein whose focus on creating a world causes him to neglect plot and characterization, Pullman creates an elaborate world (universe), tells an amazingly original story and develops wonderful characters (esp. Will who first appears in book 2).  <BR> <BR>As an historian whose work focuses on Calvinism, I was especially impressed by Pullman's creation---a world in which the Calvinist Reformation succeeded (what a scary place that would have been!). Many critics claim Pullman's work is anti-Christian but it is more of an attack against clerical institutions than an attack against religious belief per se (and ironically, the rebellion which Lyra, her father and Will stage and participate in establishes an alternative religion---that is a world without a God but which has an afterlife---if only b/c it claims that there is no afterlife).  <br />The details in this story are fantastic.  I loved the idea of a world where one's soul is visible and takes on the attributes of the character (I esp. liked the fact that one's daemon assumes a permanent form in puberty).  <br />Lyra is a wonderful character---no, she is not likeable but frankly, her likeability is irrelevant.  What is key is her mission (here Pullman seems to cheat a little---he denies the idea of Calvinist predestination but Lyra's fate is, to some degree, pre-determined).  <br />This book is not intended for young children.  I would recommend it to 14 and 15 year olds---and even then you should be fairly well-read if you want to grasp all of the subtle nuances of the book.  That said, I strongly recommend the book to adolescent girls.  Lyra is a great role model for young girls (her bravery, her intelligence and even her conviction that she is right are characteristics which young girls need to recognize are acceptable and even valuable).	2002-09-27

Goodwin writes well and the stories she recounts are fascinating. The primary weakness of the book is its focus on upper-class women as opposed to women from the working-class but the book is still well worth a read.<br /> I'm surprised to see so many reviewers criticize Goodwin for being anti-Islamic or even wrong.  The book is not at all a criticism of Islam-in fact, Goodwin goes out of her way to show the differences between fundamentalism and more traditional forms of Islam (which she argues is extremely liberal in its view of women and their rights).  Through a discussion of the legal codes imposed by fundamentalists as well as the coercive tactics used by the Islamicists, Goodwin demonstrates that it is fundamentalism, not Islam, which strips women of their rights (and she points to the dangers of Jewish and Christian fundamentalism in this regard as well).<br /> Critics who claim that the stories Goodwin recounts are not typical would do well to think about the laws in places like Saudi Arabia.  It is a fact that women there are forbidden to drive,  forbidden to mingle freely with men, forbidden to dress as they please, forbidden to leave the country without male permission etc.-these are the laws and if you think women are pleased by these laws, ask yourself if you would really like to live under these conditions yourself.  Critics would also do well to remember that human rights organizations (including Arab groups) have pointed out that the Arab world's backwardness is, in part, a result of their treatment of women (by denying women education and the right to work, these countries handicap themselves by using only half of their potential).  <br /> Many people have pointed out that one of the primary causes for the rise of fundamentalism is the extreme poverty of the Middle East-how ironic to realize that fundamentalism will lead to even greater poverty in the future by denying half the workforce the right to an education and the right to work.	2002-09-18

She crosses class and ethnic boundaries to interview women throughout the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Jordan).  My only minor complaint is that she confines herself to the Middle East---as she argues that Saudi Arabian culture has spread and changed the Islamic world throughout the Middle East I wanted to know what was happening in the Islamic world outside of the Middle East (Indonesia, the former Soviet Republics, Africa etc).  <BR> <BR>That said, I would still recommend this book highly.  Brooks' interviews with women---especially those who opted to wear the  hijab and to advocate a restricted life for women in the name of radical/revolutionary Islam---are deeply insightful.  I found the picture she painted of the Middle East incredibly tragic.  This is a region where oppression of women is rampant.  As Brooks herself points out if half of the male citizens of any country were denied their basic human rights, frequently subjected to genital mutilation or death after being raped, there would be an outcry throughout the world.  But because we are talking abt Islamic women (many of whom live in oil-rich countries) there has been a reluctance on the part of the US and other industrialized nations to criticize the Middle East.<br />Brooks' book is not a flat-out criticism of Islam---in fact, she shows through a discussion of 7th century Islamic beliefs and culture that Islam has the potential to create a world where women truly are equal to men and where women and men can enjoy the same rights and privileges.  In many ways, Christianity and Judaism lack this potential and so Brooks' insight is especially interesting.<br />This book should be read by politicians everywhere---not just women.  Anyone who cares about human rights will benefit from reading this book.	2002-09-11

White clearly has an agenda and while all good historians have an agenda, White's views are especially worrisome as he often ignores and manipulates evidence to reflect his own views.  <br /> Of particular concern is White's over-arching view of Victorianism.  In an early chapter, White claims that  \\"Victorianism worked. Rates of divorce and illegitimacy remained low.\\"   An interesting comment but one which is not at all supported by any evidence which White provides.   Low rates of divorce and illegitimacy are not evidence of happiness and/or lack of sexual license. My understanding---drawn from British material---is that abortions were frighteningly common during the late nineteenth century and that varying forms of birth control were becoming more widely available (rates of illegitimacy are thus a dicey monitor to use to assess whether Victorians lived by their own sexual standards).  Also, as any historian can tell you---divorce was uncommon simply b/c it was extraordinarily difficult to obtain.  The absence of divorce in a society (esp. one where death rates sharply curtailed the length of marriages anyway) should not be read as evidence of high social/sexual standards and/or contentment with these standards. <br /> My greatest complaint, however, is White's clear difficulty with the idea that women can assume positions other than passivity as far as sex is concerned.  White is dismissive of the concept of date rape and he quotes Robert BORK to support the idea that concern abt date rape has been overdrawn (oddly enough just because a woman agrees to be kissed or fondled does NOT mean she is willing to have sex---and the same is true of men-it is not extraordinary for young women and young men to want to give their consent to sexual acts).     <br /> White also seems dismissive of the idea that greater sexual freedom brought any type of happiness or pleasure to men or women. He cites comments from bohemians who decided that they preferred non-intellectual women but ignores the great intellectual bohemian relationships of the period completely.   <br />          What kind of an historian ignores evidence?  Not a very good one, I'm afraid.  Give this book a miss.	2002-09-05

It's the ultimate comfort food.<br />        Margaret Kendall, Riley's heroine, is a wonderful creation.  She is smart, clever, earnest in her desire to help others and gifted as a healer...all of which means that she will have a difficult time in medieval England.  Her life story--as she progresses from a village girl to London midwife to merchant's wife---makes for wonderful reading.<br />        It's a rare author who can tell a story like Margaret's without becoming overly sentimental---but Judith Merkle Riley is a gited writer who manages to bring the most fantastic characters to life without ever hitting a wrong note.<br />     My only complaint abt the book is that Riley doesn't focus enough of the marriage of Roger Kendall and Margaret---Kendall is, I think, the perfect match for Margaret and the real hero of the novel.  He is one of the only characters who truly sees Margaret as she is and cherishes her.  I know---most readers would undoubtedly prefer Brother Gregory (or Gilbert) as the hero but Margaret and Kendall's match and marriage seem to be the stuff of romantic dreams.	2002-08-23

Garrett does an amazing job detailing the emergence of new diseases, their impact and the reactions of public health officials.<BR>    <BR>    Garrett's writing is fast-paced and the stories she tells are fascinating.  Her ability to convey character is such that you will feel as tho' you personally know the epidemiologists whose stories she tells.  In fact, you will wish that you did know them---if only so that you could call them up and ask for reassurances!  <br />     The book has a few minor errors but these errors are insignificant in the greater scheme of things.  What is important is that Garrett is finally telling the general public what epidemiologists and health professionals have known for the last two decades and that is: the war against infectious diseases is far from over---in fact, it will never be over.  A chilling message but one which needs to be said as most Americans are highly complaisant about the threats posed by disease.	2002-08-06

Moo bears some disturbing parallels to David Lodge's much better academic trilogy (Changing Places, Small World and Nice Work)---Lodge's work was written earlier and is frankly much better.<br />  The characters, setting and plot should be familiar to anyone who has spent time in a university (the newly minted professor struggling to get a grip, the jaded older faculty, the endless and pointless committee meetings, the tensions between administrators and faculty and so on).  The one fairly original aspect of Moo is Smiley's inclusion of undergraduate characters who are usually completely ignored in academic novels.  Mary, an 18 yr old urban African American freshman put down in the middle of the cornfields is one of Smiley's best characters and I read the novel looking for her (alas, she is not a central character).<br />  For Smiley fans (and I am one), the book is a disappointment (it can't compare to her fantastic epic, The Greenlanders) and for those who love academic novels, the book is only mildly good.	2002-07-12

Even if the book is meant to be an exploration of creativity and imagination as opposed to a simple novel, it is a failure.  Deeply pretentious, the book does little to expose the foibles of the upper-class British.  Nothing rings true in this book.  <BR> <BR>       I am still amazed that the book receieved such attention and that McEwan is hailed as a great or even interesting writer.

David Lodge is one of the most gifted writers around and Paradise News is one of his best books.<BR> Bernard is an ex-priest who who left the priesthood after realizing that he was and always had been an atheist. His decision to leave the priesthood (which he entered as an adolescent) leaves him with no real meaning in his life until his aunt calls him to her deathbed. With his father, Bernard travels half-way around the world (from England to Hawaii) in an attempt to reconcile his father and his aunt. In doing so, he discovers who he is and what he has been searching for.<BR> The themes in this book (pedophilia/sex abuse, unresolved sexuality among young priests etc.) are especially timely right now but even without these themes the book has an incredible pull and power.	2002-07-12

Cuddy, Justin and Alice are all back again struggling for justice and equality in the New South.<BR>     I was disappointed, however, to see that Malone has had Cuddy continue to be in love with Lee Haver (a woman who does not deserve him and who I had hoped Cuddy had dumped forever).  The plot itself is good and, as always, Malone's characters carry the day.  But while Time's Witness is brilliant, First Lady is simply ordinary.	2002-07-12

It won several awards when it was released (so you have to wonder: why is it out of print?!).<BR>    I really recommend it for young girls---Binnie is a great role model and her struggle to find independence and a future in early 19th century America is one which should appeal to most girls.<BR>    Binnie is a bobbin-girl in a Lowell mill during the 1830s.  When the mill-owners cut the women's wages, Binnie and the women who live in her mother's boarding house must decide whether to strike or not.  Binnie's decision is colored by both her indignation over the unfairness of the cuts and her concerns about her mother's position (will her mother lose her job as a boarding house operator if her daughter joins the strike?).  The questions Binnie confronts and her struggle to address them are incredibly real and well-handled (Lord is a very gifted writer and her characters ring true thro'out the book).<BR>    The book also provides insights into the position of the Irish in early 19th century America as well as the overall position of women (an especially chilling scene demonstrates how few rights women had---one of the women working in the mill is pursued by an abusive husband who is given the right to seize his wife's hard-earned wages).<BR>     Buy this book instead of one of the Dear America books. It is so much better!!	2002-07-11

Malone is a really gifted writer and Time's Witness is one of his best books (much better than Uncivil Seasons).  Cuddy is the kind of man about whom women dream (he's smart, has incredible integrity and is a romantic---it doesn't matter that he describes himself as homely---that's just part of his appeal).  <BR>    Cuddy's struggle to balance his own moral code (opposition to the death penalty) with the demands of his profession (chief of police in a state which uses the death penalty) is at the heart of the novel.  But the book also explores other issues as well: class snobbery/elitism, racism, the nature of the \\"New South\\" and there is also, of course, an interesting love story with a great and very unconventional ending. <BR>      You will not regret buying this book!	2002-07-11

Malone does a great job revealing the lunacies which characterize modern academia.  The professors at Cavendish University will be very familiar to anyone who has spent any time at all at an American university.<BR>  <BR>    The story itself is also quite fun---even if you aren't a fan of Walter Raleigh (as Malone clearly is---this is not his first book to discuss Raleigh).  <br />     Malone has a great sense of humor and the book, which follows the exploits of Theo Ryan, mild-mannered professor turned literary forger, is the kind which makes you laugh out loud.  Avoid reading this in public unless you are comfortable having people watch you suddenly burst into uncontrollable laughter.	2002-07-11

As an historian, I can contextualize this book: Hewlett is no different from eugenists who argued in the 1920s that upper-class intelligent women were failing in their duty to produce children and that these women would regret it. She is also no different from 19th century gynecologists such as Edward Clarke who claimed that women who attended college would suffer from infertility and uterine problems (and like Hewlett, Clarke also insisted that women and men were/are equal!). The truth is Hewlett's thesis isn't even new---moreover, her thesis has yet to be proven with good accurate statistics and an unbiased approach to the question. <br /> Where is the discussion of the DROP which occurs in men's fertility as they age? Where is the discussion of the rise in birth defects which increase as men age? Fertility is NOT dependent solely on the woman's status---it takes two to make a baby. Hewlett's compelete disregard for and refusal to discuss male fertility and the problems which occur as men age reveals serious problems in her methodology. No scholar would ever approach a study from such a biased angle (ignoring half the problem). As an academic, I was deeply insulted by Hewlett's slipshod approach and methodology---regardless of her conclusions, her book is seriously flawed by this type of carelessness and disregard for basic standards.<BR> <BR> I strongly suggest that readers who are impressed with Hewlett look at discussions of her work which have appeared in magazines as diverse as Fortune and The American Prospect. When Fortune (not exactly a liberal magazine) condemns Hewlett's work you know it's got to be bad.  Moreover, Hewlett's claim that career-women are NOT having children is graphically refuted by both Fortune's studies as well as statistical studies by the American Prospect. Career-women, as these better studies illustrate, simply have their children at a slightly later age (and, contrary to Hewlett's thesis, they DO have children at the same rate as their working-class counterparts---they just have them later).<br /> On a personal level (since we are throwing away the idea that unbiased approaches to this issue are key), ALL of the women whom I know of who suffer from infertility are in their 20s and early 30s; fertility is not always age-related (as would be evidenced by the fact that most of my friends who are in their late 30s and early 40s have managed to get pregnant). If nothing else, the fact that Hewlett herself managed to have a child at 51 (why is this acceptable for her but not other women?) should throw a wrench in her thesis.<br /> I still find myself confused as to why Hewlett's book has generated discussion. Why did the New York Times feel a need to run op-eds discussing the fact that this book wasn't selling? Do we do this with other books which don't sell? Do we do this with books which scholars dismiss as poorly documented? Of course not. The fact that the book generated such discussion indicates the presence of a tremendous backlash against women, especially career women as well as a desire on the part of the mainstream media to create an issue which may not exist.<br /> The book has done what Hewlett intended--scared younger women into believing that marriage is the answer (look for more divorces in the future) and provided older women with \\"the\\" answer (this is the reason why they didn't have children). The truth, as always, is much more complex than Hewlett would have us believe---in fact, Hewlett's thesis (the more successful a woman is the less likely she is to have children) has already been refuted (with a better and less biased use of statistics) by several scholars and journalists. As a social commentary/explanation as to why today's families are smaller or why some women (AND MEN) are not having children, Hewlett's work is insufficient.	2002-07-01

Susanna's romance isn't a perfect one (whose is?) and the story has rather sad moments but Ibbotson creates, as always, a world which any reader would want to visit.  Her sly comments on political radicalism (in the form of Nini, the anarchist model/seamstress who works in Susanna's shop) are wonderful---too bad more earnest political writers never encountered Nini or thought more deeply about how difficult it can be to want &quot;the revolution&quot; while looking pretty...  Everyone to whom I have lent the book has loved it and wants to buy a copy (I'm more than a bit worried that I may lend this book out and never get it back).	2002-06-20

At the most basic level, Healing Ways reads like a dissertation and not a very good one at that.  There are numerous errors in the text (better copy editing and, even more importantly, a better knowledge of the field of medical history would have made this book a better and easier read).  The book is pitched as a second half to White Man's Medicine---a book written by one of Davies' professors in graduate school.  White Man's Medicine is a much better book and I am sorry to see Healing Ways paired with White Man's Medicine.	2002-06-18

The book wasn't super insightful and it is true that most of the advice contained in the book can be found in other career books. However, I really needed a book which reassured me that it was okay to leave accademia...and that leaving academia could bring me greater happiness. I loved reading the anecdotes about people who had left academia---not b/c I learned specific job-hunting tools from their stories but because the stories gave me the confidence to start my own job search. It's now been a year since I left academia. I have a fantastic job, an amazing boss, wonderful colleagues (something I never experienced in academia), a good salary with the promise of continual raises and bonuses (something NO ONE experiences in academia!) and I live where I want to live. I wouldn't say I owe it all to this book but the book really did help me start my own job search and it gave me constant reassurances (whenever I felt depressed or worried about leaving academia, I went back to this book and read over a few of the stories---this helped to give me the courage to go back out and talk to more people). I strongly recommend this book and What Color is Your Parachute? to anyone who is thinking about leaving academia. The best part of both of these books was the part where the authors told me I could find a job in a city where I wanted to live! Both books were worth the money for that alone!	2002-06-06
