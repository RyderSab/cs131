Recently, 20+ years later, I have been buying used Leica equipment and was hoping that this book would teach me something new but it has not. The book is probably good for the absolute beginner who might rate it a '4' but offers little to even the moderately experienced.<br /><br />Lacks pictures of the most important lens problems (pg 56) like fungus and de-cemented elements (which is hard to see).  Matter of factly says that de-cementing can be fixed by lens technicians by cleaning and re-gluing but in my experience they sure don't want to do it and if you can talk them into it they want an incredible price so why is this problem not noted by the book? Overall the advice is very general.<br /><br />Discusses use of a beat up a old camera (pg 31) as acceptable, though in my experience, even a new camera that had shutter problems would jam at the worst times missing the shot so I should have immediately replaced it. This sort of book should really be written by a camera repair technician wanting to help out used camera buyers.	2005-07-21

The visual phenomena are so complex that without the plates you can't possibly accurately understand what the book is talking about. Sure you could make you own examples, but if you did, you would NOT be sure, given the complex examples, that you understood what the author was talking about. Instead you will have a false understanding or incomplete understanding that will make you look foolish. The publisher is cashing in on the author's previous great work without really republishing it. This is the lowest I've ever rated a book.	2005-02-08

This book gives a reasonably complete explanation of photographic lenses for the casual to moderate user. It has some decent explanations of various lens characteristics. I drop it to a 4 rating because it could have been better had the author used pictures purposely aimed at showing lens differences. Unfortunately someone in the advertising department must have gotten a hold of the production decisions and filled the book with cutesy stock-photo advertising type shots that dumb the personality of the book down to a coffee table type book rather than create the educational type experience it could have been. A shame such great information is presented like a PhotoShop retouched advertising brochure.	2005-02-02

For the 7th Edition listing information up to 2002: Brief identification and functional information  for Leica-M to M7 and Leica-R to R9. For M lenses all but the newest 50mm F1.4 Asph (unless I've forgotten another new M lens, for R lenses I don't know). Basically all lenses until about the year 2002 publish date.     The information is designed to help the purchaser of historical pieces quickly determine differences so most of the important facts are listed. Two MTF graphs for almost all lenses except a few older ones. The biggest aperture and the best aperture MTF are given. Pictures of nearly all lenses and variations. A thrill to read and use. Erwin Puts comments are included with the MTF's.    Includes Visoflex system adapter chart and lenses and Telyt information. R lens camming explained and pictured. Screw and Bayonet M and R Body historical chart with important yet limited list of defining features given. Digital to Digilux-1 plus Leica S1 \\"scanner\\" studio camera for M & R lenses digital basics and models. Compact cameras until 2002. Page 88-90 MTF and filter types explained (missing is filter size and thread chart!).  Special body models and lenses listed. Servicing discussed.     Serial numbers for bodies and lenses. Add to this the \\"Leica Handbook 2002/2003\\" (buy direct from Leica) which has better filter information and a few web downloads from Leica USA and you can identify and build a Leica system.A truly great reference book that I use constantly to compare and purchase lenses. THE best of these quick reference books.	2005-01-12
US	51642870	R2EGE5VT9RFIOL	1581150563	348507932	The Business of Being an Artist	Books	5	81	82	N	Y	Fantastic overview very insightful.	I read the 3rd edition by Daniel Grant. The book is aimed mainly at oil painters and sculptures. Even though I am interested in selling fine art photography the information was still much help since it gives such a complete view of selling art. Sales outlets include galleries, mail order, Internet, and others including the likely hood of success in each and examples of persons who have been successful in each. The conversational style is easy to read. Positives and negatives of various sales methods are given. The book neither depresses nor thrills but seems to evenly cover the material. Many many issues of selling art are covered. Just when you think the author is done he comes up with another factor to consider. Personal issues as to how to act are covered as part of the explanations and a chapter on \\"Handling the Pressures\\" of success and waiting for success is included. It includes an Appendix of names and addresses of helpful organizations. Makes you feel like you could make money in the arts. Overall it was a great read.	2004-12-20

The book covers many subjects one needs to think about as a Christian in business. It gives advice based on many many actual experiences that he's encountered while counseling including hiring, firing, and many tough convoluted business situations. For many people needing an orientation to general business and the moral dilemmas one faces these are quite fascinating. Just reading them may help you stay out of some real bad business situations and get a feel for what can go wrong. Much of his advice is buried in paragraphs rather than bold lettered or otherwise separated to make it absolutely clear. I do the best I can extracting a small bit of it below that I found somewhat extreme. Overall an interesting read that people fully knowledgeable of the bible and life will find themselves arguing with occasionally. I respectfully question from the 1998 edition:    * Says to tithe from Gross Income (aka income before taxes page 237). Apparently suggests the business should tithe as well as the individual and from Gross \\"before tax\\" income. Suggests this in spite of the fact that the individual is already tithing from personal income. He plainly does not understand or sidesteps the concept of double taxation and income realization of owners though judging from his writing tone I bet he would argue bitterly saying that he does understand this. See for yourself on page 238 and all the rest of Chapter 19. In the bible the Jewish government allowed paying tithe as first fruits but our non-Christian government does not so how can we realistically obey this?    Where is the new testament tithe? It is gone - instead a parable is given where the poor women gave a little that she had and the rich man gave more but neither was called a tithe or was the 10% spoken of in the old testament (see below). If you are poor you pay little if you are rich you pay more and your government taxes are already alms supporting many many poor people and people who don't work and people who have wrecked their lives and ended up in government housing. Joel Osteen charges to get in the door, this makes sense given the high cost of a ministry of his type and he should be paid well for the public political and personal \\"hits\\" that he takes and high reputation that he must maintain.    * Suggests the twentieth century tithe is the same as old testament tithe under a biblical government. Problem is the tithe was paid to Mekezdek (spelling?) a priest-&-king and to the old testament church only when the church was acting as the church-&-government yet he says the tithe should not be adjusted in amount today when the church is no longer the government (page 234).    * Says \\"If you aren't willing to perform what you vow (promise to do), even at the cost (of loosing) all your material assets, then you have...a spiritual problem (p. 81). So what if you make an honest mistake? Is it to everyone's benefit and does it make God happy that you loose everything trying to pay back what you can't? How can Christians participate in large business deals with an attitude like this? So are we to stand on the sideline as others run all the large businesses?    * Asserts that Paul's suggestion of women as assistants to men (as Genesis also says) only applies within the church or in some family situations and maybe not in all. He worms around this issue enough to satisfy everyone and as we know you can't satisfy everyone and the bible on this issue. From a practical standpoint he really sets the bible's overall direction to the side on this issue even though underneath it all he may be more conservative than he lets on. Read the book to see for yourself (pages 119, 156).    * The bible translation used isn't named anywhere that I can find and this matters in these days of so many translations and when the translating teams contain many non-Christians who have declared an agenda to change the bible from its original intentions and evolve it to something different to their liking.    * Mayhave confused the suing Christians issue since author says a Christian should not sue another person who claims to be Christian even though this other person is plainly cheating him by constant lying. Certainly you could sue a slanderous stealing non-Christian couldn't you? If a person keeps lying after being approached by yourself and others on the issue then you are to treat them as an outsider according to the bible (Mathew 18:15-17). See page 208. Should someone be allowed to cheat you in a business deal just because he waves the \\"I'm a Christian flag\\" don't sue me? Again how can Christians participate in big business when they allow others to steal their profits thus putting them out of business?    Conclusion: Worth reading for those entering business for its story telling style of business situations and problems that one can fall into. The book gives much good advice and should be applauded for tackling tough issues. Deserves a 3 to 5 rating depending on whether you expect the author to be right about everything; this reader did not consider him to be.	2004-12-13

An in depth view that stops short of being a hardcore text book though I would not hesitate to use it as an introductory text for a college class. This makes it an enjoyable, non-threatening, yet extensive, read that lists many design principles for mainly print type publications. The design principles are taught such that they can be more broadly applied to other disciplines by a creative thinker. Contents include the concepts of: Space, Unity, Page Architecture, and Type. A good first read on the subject and gives much more useful information and advice than many of the self glorifying self indulgent publications that other designers put out. The book does not list many specifics for different types of publications, it does give an in depth description of the guiding theories of design for print. the chapters on the use of space are more complete than others I've read. Highly recommended	2004-11-07

The section on the attempted but mostly thwarted terrorist war at sea was fascinating. Amazon reviews vary based on the politics of the reviewers. As with many decisions of war they are brilliant or stupid depending on your point of view.  I must comment that I rate the book highly as a current source of information that I don't want to miss since these type of books go out of print and are seldom reprinted due to the \\"hear and now news\\" flavor of the writing. So buy now for the current information and hold your nose if you don't like the politics. I give a 4 instead of 5 since history will likely provide 20/20 hindsight that could change some of the conclusions so a 4 is likely my best rating for any \\"current news\\" type book.	2004-10-24

For those of us who were taught advertising in college in the 1970's Brand Management is a larger concept that replaces advertising as the leading conceptual framework for company-consumer interaction. If one book covers the most important points then this book is it.  Those who hope to produce a brand in the real world will appreciate the chapter arrangement since each chapter covers, as a management conceptual overview, how to do implement the corporate brand activity within a corporate environment. It is not a book on esoteric mathematics like some management schools like to produce. Instead it is a fine conceptual overview of the brand management activity itself though not a step by step book. I would be cheating you to give a summary of its points here. Highly recommended.	2004-10-12

Covers the topic well showing formulas that relate to DOF including image magnification, hyperfocal distance, and DOF itself. Some basic lens design information. Discusses Airy disc and degree of print/slide enlargement considerations which is hard to find information. A bit hard to understand at times but I made it through okay. About half of book is Depth of Field charts for 35mm, 6cm x 6cm, 6m x 9cm, 4\\"x5\\", 5\\"x7\\", 8\\"x10\\" formats. Author has written other books and had much experience in photography though his formal education was in Anthropology.

They lived a hard life on the road. Donohue divorced. A rare look from an engineer driver's point of view and the sometimes austere and lonely life of racing. Roger Penske was his team owner and is commented on from Donohue's point of view. Somehow this book changes you as a person as you seem to experience Donohue's racing life though an un-glossed writing style. This style is part of the secret of the books greatness. Though it was likely edited by someone it was NOT \\"normalized\\" to be a standard bland coffee table book. Instead it remains in character to the situations and people involved. A rare look into someone else's professional life. Highly recommended.	2004-09-23

For First Edition: This book has many construction dates, history, and pictures of Leica lenses. Includes reasonably big pictures of many lenses to give you the sense of physical character of the lenses. Seems to cover all old lenses and new up to 1994. Only seems to have information on 35mm ASPH and not other Asph lenses or on the newer lenses. For the used buyer you should get the Leica Pocket Book by Erwin Puts with this or before this book. Sartorius book \\"Identifying Leica Lenses\\" is also helpful for used buyer. Also has a list of serial numbers up to 1988. Includes info on old leica copy equipment and many other accessories with pictures of much but not all items. It has Visoflex information. Includes R & L body information and pictures.

It is written intelligently and to a good depth for a sort of advanced overview book. The author goes in depth as needed without boring with excessive technical details and the author's experience shows with good comments. He covers a bit on how rangefinder cameras are unique. M6 and old Leica M bodies are introduced with moderate detail. Film loading is shown for early and late cameras. He comments on new and old lenses but not on all lenses (1994 copyright with reprint of the same in 2001) so the only Aspherical lens mentioned is 35mm F/1.4. Visoflex is discussed. Overall this is a sort of advanced beginners book written for the Leica's more intellectual market yet it has a personal edge that endears.	2004-09-23

This book uses the teaching by example system giving illustrated examples of the author's past advertising design work. I did not get the in-depth education in visual design that I had hoped for. Rand's work uses a combination of simple to mid complexity visuals that communicate in an abstract high brow way. It is this sophistication that I suppose makes others give the book such high ratings. If more text was added to explain the principles then the book would have been a much better educational experience. A 4 rating for visual quality and examples, a 3 for content, are fair ratings.	2004-09-23

Rudolf Kingslake was educated in optics in England then made his way from England to the USA and became in 1937 the head of the Kodak lens design department. This was a time when the strong hand of a leader was allowed to create excellence. Kodak made the famous Ektar Large Format lenses during his leadership. These lenses still compete with modern day lenses (at least those of the 1980's) even though today's modern glasses were not available to him and they do lack the modern flare reducing coatings. So this man is an authority on the history of lens design. I wish he gave more opinion and reputation type remarks since he must have seen it all in lens design. He includes brief comments on lens designers and gives their photo or sketched portraits from the late 1700's through the 1900's. An historically important book though not as complete as I would have liked. Rates a 5 for historical importance alone.	2004-09-23

If you are tired of the average \\"artsy & wondering\\" lighting book then this one may be for you. The writers do a better job of covering the placement of lights and how that effects the creation of direct or diffuse lighting than any other book I've seen and I've easily read 6 lighting books from cover to cover over the years. Hunter and Fuqua (love that name) cover product photography and the problems of achieving good edge contrast and handling glare. They don't wimp out when you want to know how to handle black-on-black or white-on-white contrast problems. They tell how to light glass and metal also. Their explanations of light physics are given at a layman's understanding level though this does not hurt the book much. Just remember, light angle in = light angle out, and you can probably follow their examples. <br /> <br />The portrait chapter falsely called \\"An Arsenal of Lights\\" is better than most portrait books that I've read. Other writings on portraits I've seen just put their head in the sand and maybe give a couple of their pet peeves of bad lighting then tell you that their are no rules. This book is much better as it covers the basic lights for  portraits, short and broad lighting technique, and more. They give you the tools to work with, telling you which lights go where and why so you at least have a starting point when trying to make a person look beautiful in 2d. This is not really an aesthetics book but a tools and techniques of the trade kind of book that is greatly needed. Very Highly recommended.	2004-09-23

This guy apparently has tested almost all of the old and new Leica lenses and he gives a verbal description of the visual characteristics of  almost all of the lenses rating the lens as low, medium, or high contrast for each area of the lens starting at the center and working out to the edge of the lens. The quality progression of Leica lenses throughout history and their manufacturing environment is explained. Optical lens design and optical aberrations are discussed from an artistic standpoint and with reasonable detail for the non-engineer. Covers both M and R lens types. He respects both Rangefinder (M lens) and SLR (R lens)  types of photography. There is so much information that some sections will undoubtedly need rereading.    His website goes even further: ...[...]  This site is the tour de force Leica website that all others are compared to for its intellectual brilliance. New lenses that the book doesn't cover are reviewed on the site. He has the best technical explanations available within photography.    The author also has written an excellent \\"how to choose & use\\" type publication called Leica M-Lenses (Their soul and secrets) for Leica that is the best I've ever read at telling what lenses are best to use for given situations. This publication can normally be found on the Leica website (at least in the USA).    His enthusiasm for photography and intelligent written discourse are about the best available within the photographic industry. It is a welcome change from the stupid pabulum of most photo magazines that are written for some supposed general idiot audience. I've reread the book many times... it has earned its keep and his website has affected my view of photography more than any magazine. His viewpoint has a technical emphasis and he notes how the technical can be used to creative effect. He is a European writer who handles the English language very well including theproduction of many very insightful statements. No, I don't work for him or his publishing company I just find his writing to be one of the defining forces of modern day Leica photography.	2004-03-05

This book covers a tremendous amount of information that the general woodworker needs to know but would likely take 20 years to learn on his own. So why isn't it sold in my local wood working specialty store? Because it has a weak first chapter that can be confusing and slightly incomplete. Other parts of the book are better written. Don't let the first chapter scare you off just keep reading, it gets much better and quite thrilling at times. By the time you finish you will feel as though you've taken a college level overview course on woodworking. The information gets deep but is decently written for the non-engineer most of the time.

Higgins shows how atomic structure influences material properties. The first three chapters &quot;The Atom&quot;, &quot;The Molecule&quot;, &quot;The Crystal&quot;, give the best explanation I've ever read about atomic structure, as good or better than does the famous teacher Feynman. The rest of the book is a theoretical overview that goes deep enough to explain the key points of how metals, plastics, composites, and ceramics are different from one another. Most every sentence counts so read carefully. The progress is simple though and puts to shame most American texts on the subject. The math is minimal and included mainly to support the theory in the text. After reading the text you will have a overview of the key information necessary to use various materials. A truly great book. It is no wonder that professional auto racing such as Formula 1 and even the making of most top race cars for American open wheel racing such as for IRL and CART is done in England where the author Higgins lives. It is a true shame that in American colleges books like this which do such a fine job of explaining basic concepts are usually passed by in favor of books giving mathematical spaghetti that explains poorly due to not explaining the individual steps of the math. Thank you Higgins for one of the greatest books I've read on engineering.	2003-10-02
US	51642870	R32FTFDMPGK9X	0240801687	367375414	Photography and the Performing Arts	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A reasonably complete book on the subject.	This book is long enough to be complete, 189 pages, and does not get boring. The author covers more angles on the subject than one might imagine. The typical camera and lens information of photo books is covered plus many other fascinating aspects of Theater photography such as &quot;Photographic Needs of Individuals&quot; such as actors, musicians, singers, dancers, etc.. He also covers picture quality factors and marketing of services and does so while remaining insightful. This is better than the average overview books of its type available by other authors and working photographers. I must say that Kopelow has done a fine job. The price of this book is brutally high, likely since it has little or no competition for the particular type of photography that it considers, but I don't feel cheated as I have when buying other high priced books.	2003-02-12

The books are technical yet written like short vignettes on each subject such as lens design, optics and physics factors, etc.. These books are great for someone not interested in the math but who want a BRIEF understanding of optics as applied to photography and a tremendous variety of photographic system like TV, viewfinders, enlargers, etc.. Fascinating information including the basics and beyond without becoming a designers guide. They probably should be reissued by the publisher.	2003-02-12

This book might be called an advanced basics book if there is such a thing. It explains some important technical information about how lenses are judged by optic designers for contrast quality. I've read a number of Leica books and have not found this information presented in this fascinating way anywhere else.     The book discusses different lens use situations such as for landscapes, portraits, etc. suggesting possible lens sizes for each. SLR Leica focusing bellows, macro adapter, photar close-up lenses, extenders, and telescope eyepiece are covered. Lens/distance perspective is explained.     A number of useful charts are included such as the ratio's between different lens lengths. A short review of all current (as of 1993) Leica R and M lenses is in the back. Some of these basics books are a just an overview and bore but I think this one is a step above in that it covers a lot of material including some insight into when to use a given lens. I say it is worth the money unless you are an old timer who already knows it all.     Discusses the uses of lenses most. The full historical line of lenses is not presented but only those current at the time of publication.	2003-02-12

I bought and read every page of all three of Steve Anchell's black and white photo information books: The Variable Contrast Printing Manual, The Film Developing Cookbook, and The Darkroom Cookbook. Why? Because he gives a mix of an historical view plus tells what to pick of the best current chemistries. He does this without bogging down in the actual complexities of a college chemistry course keeping it at a usable technicians level. Since he also tells you why you are using various chemicals or paper his books do not dumb down but instead give you fascinating useful information. Anyone serious about darkroom work will appreciate his insights and commentary about chemistry use. He lists so many historical and current B&W chemical formulas and their use that any B&W experimenter will find the books useful.	2003-02-12

Beginners may get information overload but anyone who has already done B&W developing will appreciate the vast amount of information. These books could use an overall rewrite to make them a bit simpler to understand, in spite of this they are one of the few sources to accumulate this B&W information and are well worth owning as a reference and explanation.	2003-02-12

Andreas Feininger was one of the great photo writers of the 1970's and likely other periods since he produced a large number of books. This book is so all-inclusive on the subject that it takes a while to read but it is worth it since, as he puts it, he gives away many of the secrets that other photo writers browse over. He is very much a thinking artist and seems glad to give knowledge away to others. This book should be reissued by Dover of some such old book publisher.	2003-02-12

The core knowledge and organization of theater is here. Not too basic. Does expand on topics. While getting a Masters Degree in motion picture writing and directing I took a class from the acting school which used this book. Most of the insights in the book apply to both plays and recorded performing arts though Hodge fully defines what makes play production different from the recorded mediums. The author is truly brilliant in his inclusiveness and insights into story telling using human performance. The book is not boring to those of us who love the detail that gives a deep understanding of how things work. While most books I've read about directing are only the author's limited viewpoint of that which they've experienced while directing, Hodge departs from this easy approach by producing a complete directorial viewpoint that gives the student of directing the broad tools necessary to handle the complex activity of play directing as a professional. You can't possibly go wrong by reading the third edition of this book; one hopes that the future editions are as fine. It was one of those life enriching reads that those of us who love to understand things will never forget. Thank you Francis Hodge.	2002-11-16

This book gives numerous methods of how to locate your position in the field. Maybe not as technical as some would like but a good first book on the subject. My own view is that the methods given are simple enough that I would likely recall them if I was a nearly panicking person lost in the wild. If you don't know much about tracking and navigation it could be a fun page-turner initiation on the subject. As a scriptwriter looking for a good orientation I found it to be quite helpful.	2002-11-12

This sort of treatise has been done for screenplay writing where human mental principles are defined then shown how they affect storytelling. The author does the same for photography starting with Gestalt (grouping) psychology principles and then covering many others. Thus psychology principles that help photographers create and analyze photographs are given. This is not a book on camera technique but one one how a person experiences a photograph. Knowing how the mind of the photo viewer thinks really helps the photographer reach his/her photographic communication goal since the photographer can now press the correct psychological buttons to move the viewer's mind rather than relying purely on artistic intuition. I have a masters degree in filmmaking and this type of deep thinking into the photo experience is what I was looking for and the book delivers. Thank you author Zakia...one of the great photographic minds.	2002-10-31

You might miss the main points of the subject reading only this book. It is comprehensive in scope but lacks insightful explanations so that major concepts don't appear clearly. The overview chapters at the beginning confuse rather than orient the reader.     As someone who has done technical writing for a commercial software package I recognize this as the first draft which covers the material but has yet to be rewritten in a way that will best orient the new user. I expect more given the high prices of technical books since I paid $52!     As a student I certainly disagree with what the instructors who give the book a 5 have to say about the book! No I am not countering with a one. The book is a classic 1 or 2.	2002-08-24

As the book attempts to give an informative overview of various expert system techniques it fails to clearly communicate them due to its lack of clear &quot;how to&quot; instructions which are absolutely necessary to explain the complex principles covered. I have a Master's degree in Communications myself  and find this book to be one of the types assigned to students due to its industry status rather than because it gets the job of education done.	2002-08-23

The type of book that should be reissued without fail by the publisher, though it is old, since it is a classic in its field. Actual numerical distances and their effect/use/experience by humans are explained as well as much about eyesight and its abilities. Hall also explains how different Euro cultures (German, French, and others) plus how Americans use space differently. I'm seldom this positive about any book but must give this one a highest rating.	2002-08-23

Many quick reference \\"dial\\" type calculators are included to play with though it is unforgivable to not include depth-of-field information for 35mm films. The excuse given is \\"Since many lenses for 35mm have depth of field scales\\" Kodak does not include them in this expensive guide! This is NOT true about modern 35mm lenses, many are missing the DOF scales especially on zooms, and it is really a stupid omission given the great use of 35mm professionally these days. Depth of field should also be included for 1/2\\" digital sensors, etc. which are also being used professionally. Given the fact that Kodak publishes some other great literature this guide strikes me as an out of date poor example of their product. It is in need of update to include digital data as well as full 35mm information...	2002-08-10

For those that like such intricate creative writing this book gives it in full. What is interesting or a bore depending on one's view is how this type of art criticism writing attempts to expand on a few aspects of art-and-artist until a whole book is written when in fact a twenty page report could have told you all you needed to know. This is art criticism for the sake of writing art criticism thus for those who like such artistic blather it is a masterpiece. Does also cover the historical continuum of the subject.	2002-07-30
