Mr. Levitt's brilliant and direct assessment of what's wrong with Wall Street should be high on everyone's list with a dollar in a 401(k) plan or with a brokerage.<br />For all the money spent on educating market professionals our country has apparently not been well served. In fairness that's an overstatement, but it does illustrate that for all the CPA's, MBA's, and CFA's carrying a brief-case around America, technical knowledge means very little if people cannot tell the difference between ethical and unethical, a lie and a truth, or good and bad behavior.<br />In reality we should all perhaps strive to take several pages from Warren Buffett as well: get a hobby, buy value, mistrust Wall Street, don't gamble, choose your friends wisely, when you're on the mainline to Chicago from NY there are no side-trips in Altoona, etc...<br />Above all else read Benjamin Graham's 'Security Analysis'.

General Flanagan's memoir of his time in Vietnam is one of the most personal and sorrowful accounts of that American tragedy yet.<br />The Kirkus review tells us, &quot;you will not find the meaning&quot; of the Vietnam War in this book. And that's true. John F. Flanagan didn't go to Vietnam to do that. He went as a Warrior and the nature of that war weighed heavily upon him. It does to this day.<br />In a way I would classify this personal history with E.B. Sledge's masterpiece WITH THE OLD BREED. The times and perspective are different, but seeing the elephant remains the same. When all the grandstanding and speeches are over, all the flag waving and parades, ultimately men risk their lives for their friends. These men are usually too preoccupied with the task at hand to &quot;figure it all out&quot;.<br />Sledge saw war and was horrified by it's spector, it's indifferent carnage and filth. He had the rectitude though of having returned a 'winner'. All those boys were killed, but their death had some purpose. John Flanagan couldn't feel that. He just knew that the friends he lost and saw die, died vainly. No matter how good these men were, how much moral certitude they had, their deaths were without purpose. John Flanagan is a man of purpose.<br />General Flanagan reflects great dignity upon those men and to their families. He's a man of quiet dignity himself and can take pride in knowing that he did all he could when he could. As a Soldier that's what's known as trust.<br />My best wishes go out to General Flanagan, his family and friends.	2001-06-17

Ten years ago I first read this book and was literally knocked for a loop.  I immediately read Neil Sheehan's A BRIGHT SHINING LIE afterward and felt  exhausted. Not because these books were written at a breakneck pace, but  that the truth was being spoken to me about one of the most controversial  and cathartic pieces of our American 20th Century - and no one in the media  or politics seemed to care. Hack's and Sheehan's books were both  best-sellers, but has anyone in the media read and understood them? Are we  still afraid to hurt the feelings of some of the men whose actions,  conceits and flawed thinking resulted in over 58,000 American deaths and  several hundreds of thousand of Vietnamese deaths? The truth will set you  free....<br />I can only hope that both of these books make it as course  material requirements at our nation's military academies and  colleges...along with William Corson's BETRAYAL and H.R.

I found James Brady's book to be a good one, but only when he stayed with Korea and the situation of the Marines on the ground.

This works  in an Anton Myrer piece of fiction, but comes off clumsy here. I found it a  distraction. Other than that, the book worked for me.
