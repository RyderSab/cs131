Probably the last Christian nation left upon the earth, until driven down, the South possessed Biblical faith, and had Godly leaders from which men could learn. As a \\"northerner\\", raised in the government school system, needless to say, there were many things in this book that I never learned until conversion. When my first son was born (16 years ago), it was Gen. Lee's Letters that taught me much on fatherhood, and it is this small, but powerful voiume that all my sons read, enjoy, and are inspired by. Do not think that this is merely for young adults: it will one of the most valuable books you will ever own. If you desire fatherhood, you must read this work. If you are a young girl, and need to know what to look for in a man, read this work. If you are a young man, in need of direction (if you are not in need of this direction, but already possess it, please call me, for I have two beautiful daughers I wish you to meet!), please let nothing hinder you from this inspiring work. PS A great companion to this book is the video, \\"The Great Civil War Debate\\" between the author and Rev. Peter Marshall. At its conclusion, you will have a tough time remaining in your seat, for you will want to stand and shout, over Wilken's low view of man, and high view of Almighty God.	2001-07-02

His view of the Scriptures is one in which he must twist it to fit his morality, espcially in light of slavery.  The bible teaches men how to treat one another, including slaves and masters, but Mr. Marshall calls slavery inheritantly evil, which condemns the Apostle Paul for NOT condemning it.  Most importantly, however, in seeing how Marshall goes astray is his portrait of Almighty God as a divine being who tries, and tries, but man simply won't listen--in short, a being who derives his power from man's will, and who's arms are tied by man.  This is not the God of the bible.  <br />To see this in clarity, get the video &quot;The Great Civil War Debate&quot; which Mr. Marshall is clearly thrashed by Steve Wilkens, from start to finish, as Wilkens shines for the glory of God, and Marshall holds to the human morality that appealed to the pride of man in the North, and brought incredible bloodshed, and did nohing to free the negro race in America.	2001-06-20

This may sound strange, but I rank this little book as one of the two greatest paperback books that a man could own. (you'll have to guess the other)<BR>Why the stupendous claim? Edwards was one of the greatest minds ever given to the Christian Church, and he had an amazing way of seeing life, through the lenses of Scripture, and understanding, like a photo-negative, what hell must be like. Hell, like the beauties of Heaven, is unable to be expressed in human language, and therefore, it can only be \\"seen\\" through the use of symbolic language. The horror of hell can not be uttered: if a man were to see hell, he could not live. Like Paul in the vision of Heaven, there are no faculties within natural man to express what he experienced. Edwards finds a way to help. <br />When you read Edwards on Heaven, you feel almost \\"other-worldly\\", (\\"how long have I been sitting here reading this??), and when you read Edwards on Hell, the holy dread that fills your mind and emotions is overwhelming, as well as life-changing. Dr. Gerstner goes for the Truth, which he unashamedly owns, and has a true gift of representing Edwards' sight to anyone who cares to see. Gerstner does not write with \\"one eye on impressing the scholar\\", but with a deep care for the reader, almost pleading with us: \\"Hear Edwards! If you hear him, you will hear Paul, and therefore, you will HEAR CHRIST!\\".	2001-05-07

(Men, pick it up and enjoy the fresh insights into the souls of your daughters, as you carefully cultivate these qualities in them!).<br />The Wilsons have been saying through their works what the Church of our generation so desperately needs to hear:  there is hope for the family!  In our day, we have been deluged with the advance of pop psychology intermingled with a few Scriptures, and the results have been nothing short of heart-breaking....families  either broken apart, or hanging together by a thread, rather than the glorious example of the love of Christ to His Church. What is our testimony?  What can we say to the world when our own families are in turmoil?  How can we say, &quot;follow us&quot; when our own children do not follow us??<br />I urge every Christian to get the series of books from the Wilsons and see for yourselves: God has not left us without instructions!  He has given us blue-prints to carefully follow, in glorious detail,  and behind these instructions lies the wonderful promise of success:<br />Men loving their wives, Wives reverencing their husbands, children growing up to faithfully love Christ and family.<br />What more could you want in life.  <br />Please look into:  Standing On the Promises, Fidelity, The Fruit of Her Hands, and other works by the Wilsons...<br />Nancy, on behalf of my wife, my daughters, and the lovely ladies of our congregation:  many thanks!	2000-12-12

Chris Ward is becoming one of my favorite chess authors....he is challenging, but remains humble and down to earth.  Here, he lays out a series of chess puzzles, in a multiple choice format.

Okay, okay, playing through Morphy's games will delight you and improve your chess; but many chess books rise or fall on the writer. Here, we are given Chris Ward, and to go righ to the matter:  he writes warmly, with  humility (something not seen too often in chess writers) and with humor.  Its refreshing to hear someone who is honest, but doesn't make the reader  feel like an idiot.  My only criticism of the book?  More text!  I would  love to hear more personal touches from both Morphy's life and the authors!  Let's hope we get much more of this author!	1999-09-29

Imagine growing up in a Christian church and never experiencing joy...Why?  I don't listen to much CCM these days for pretty much the same reason so many grow up in churches without joy:  It seems that too many are afraid of  life!  Somehow, if they experience the joys of God's wonderful creation, it  must be wrong...Being so quick to dismiss anything prior to the industrial  revolution as antiquated, we have fallen prey to a false piety...almost a  soul-less exsistance where sin is found in matter (it  most certainly does  not!), and life is only something to survive in.This book brings Calvinism  home. God created all things, and part of our worship of Him is to express  our thanks by enjoying His creation.  As Christians, we should fear NOT to  celebrate His goodness...why do we preach joy, but not live it?This book  brings it home.Again.PHyatt	1999-04-10

GM Yasser Seirawan writes an account of the historic rematch between the suddenly appearing Bobby Fischer, and the long-obscured Boris Spassky.  I love this book!  Seirawan makes no apology for being a fan.  He writes with honesty, but with the same child-like excitement that any Fischer fan would feel, from the preparations to the actual match itself.  Most impressive to me was how the author did not skirt the issue of Fischer's outrageous remarks, but rather gave an honest assessment:  Here is what Bobby said, and here is WHY he might have said it.   Seirawan's enthusiam is contagious, and his notes, for the most part, don't shoot straight over the head of the average reader; therefore, being helpful to the chess amateur.  I did not buy this book for the analysis of the games, but for the fan's view of the event, and I was not disappointed!  Rev. Peter F. Hyatt,  New York	1998-05-13
