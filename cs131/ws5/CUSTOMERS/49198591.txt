Navin started with the story of Michaela in The Princess of Park Lane, and continues with Trista in the Heiress of Hyde Park; I'm reading Princess right now, and it looks to be a better story than Beauty. <br /> <br />The plot is flawless in this book. You have the heroine, Sophie Temple, the daughter of a courtesan, who decides to impersonate the daughter of another courtesan so that she can claim that dead child's inheritance as one of the Earl of Woolrich's natural daughters. She wants to have a season, meet someone rich and titled, and become respectable.  <br /> <br />While staying at her 'Aunt May''s house, Sophie meets Lord Gideon Ashford, her patroness' brother-in-law and a rake, and sparks fly. At the same time she is pursued by Lord Oliver Burton, which her friend Margaux is hopelessly in love with. Thinking that she can't lust after her best friend's husband-to-be, Margaux cultivates the friendship of Lord Farnsworth instead. As luck would have it, Farnsworth just happens to be Ashford's friend and also the one person who knows Sophie is not who she says she is.. <br /> <br />The story starts quite slowly with Sophie getting to know the injured Ashford better. At every turn Navin makes sure to remind the reader that she's feeling guilty of being found out, so much so that I found it tiresome.  <br /> <br />I felt the conversation uninspiring as well - nothing seemed quite real among the characters, at least until the last third of the book. Among other things, Ashford ends up offering for Margaux because he is caught with her in his arms after rescuing her from Farnsworth, Sophie confesses, finds her true love, and all is revealed.  <br /> <br />There are still gems, as when Ashford persuades Margaux's mother to invite him to her home, but the pacing of the plot could have been better, as could the dialogue. Navin is definitely capable of better, as I've seen in Princess. <br /> <br />These books should be read in sequence, as May's story slowly unfolds across each book. I did find some things completely unbelievable though - it's possible to introduce one or two natural children into the ton, but surely not so many? And such natural children would unlikely have been considered 'good ton' - it doesn't seem likely that society would have accepted a peer marrying Sophie. Then again, romances are escapist, so what's a little more fantasy.	2005-09-11

She has the looks and the money, and she absolutely has to show that her friend Lucas' rejection of her means nothing. <br /> <br />Marianne Hughes, widow, takes on the role of chaperon for Louisa when her sister-in-law gets pregnant and is unable to look after Louisa in London. How bad can it be, after all? <br /> <br />John Sinclair, marquess of Gillingham, decides that he needs to visit London to get himself a wife. He is believed to be horribly disfigured by smallpox, and has kept out of the public eye for ages - but he is not getting any younger. <br /> <br />The stage is set for three-way romance when Louisa decides she will be civil to John to show Lucas how selfless she can be; John figures Louisa is as good a potential wife as any; and Marianne and John feel the passion flare between them every time he visits to pay court to Louisa. Things become complicated when he carelessly says something that Louisa takes to be a marriage proposal to her, just as he is beginning to realise that he really wants Marianne, not Louisa. <br /> <br />Just to make the mix more interesting, Lord John and Marianne foil some attempts on Louisa's life (they think) while he tries to make peace with Lord Gabriel Sinclair, John's estranged brother..  <br /> <br />This is my first story by Nicole Byrd, and it whetted my appetite for her other books. I would love to find out more about Gabriel and Psyche, and Psyche's sister Circe as well. I didn't like Louisa or Lucas very much though - Louisa seemed too spoilt and self-centred to have taken so much of the book, though she clearly loves Lucas. Perhaps it was because she didn't seem to have learned very much by the end of the story.  <br /> <br />A preview of the next book, Vision in Blue, shows that Louisa will have a part to play there, and perhaps she's changed by then.	2005-05-02

He's just discovered Seymour, and said that A Line in the Sand is the best of the lot, especially for someone who doesn't normally read suspense novels. <br /> <br />He's right, it's a good story. Seymour starts off with a number of separate threads which come together with terrifying effect towards the end. The further I read the more reluctant I was to put it down. <br /> <br />There are a number of heroes in this book. The main protagonist is Frank Perry, formerly Gavin Hughes, who was instrumental in slowing down Iran's WMD programme. The Iranians have finally tracked him down, and have sent their best assassin to Suffolk to kill him. The Secret Service asks Perry to move, but he won't leave his family and friends again, in effect drawing \\"a line in the sand\\" that he defies the authorities, and later the assassin, to cross. <br /> <br />What follows is an escalating protection programme for Perry, his wife and stepson, and things get ugly when the villagers find out about it - the Perry family is rejected out of hand because everyone needs to be accepted by  everyone else for some reason or other. One villager is gay, for example; others have carved a place in village society that they don't want to lose. I found this the most powerful part of this book, not just because it was so natural and believable, but because it could happen to anyone albeit not on such a scale. <br /> <br />Interwoven with Perry's tale are parallel stories of the hunt for the assassin, right down to the personal lives of the people involved, and his easy evasion of his pursuers. Things begin a little slowly, but the suspense builds as there are several false starts and stops on both sides.   <br /> <br />The story begins with a bird, and ends with the same bird. It's probably crazy that a wild bird is instrumental to the plot, but it is, and readers should look out for mentions of it.<br /> <br />Seymour writes well, though it was heavy going for me in places where history, politics and religion were discussed in great detail. Overall though it is a book I'd recommend even to those who aren't interested in politics, the secret service, and terrorism. My edition was published in 1999, pre-September 11 and before the Iraq war, but in this day and age, most readers would be able to recognise terms like terrorism and WMD when they come up in the text.	2005-05-01
US	49198591	R9TYAV34E2WQ7	0451202740	60599976	Mothers and Sons	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The Gabaldon story was great	I'd read the older Mothers & Daughters, which is more lighthearted, and expected Mothers & Sons to be the same. Of the 12 stories, I truly enjoyed only three: the ones by Diana Gabaldon and her son Sam, Eric Jerome Dickey, and Eileen Goudge. There were a lot of reminisces of actual writers' lives in this book, versus pure fiction or fictionalised writing in Mothers & Daughters, and I didn't actually want to read about that. <br /> <br />Then again, the anthologies may have been different because there is truly a difference in the way mothers treat daughters and sons, and also the way that male authors write, so I really shouldn't complain. But I'd hoped to enjoy all the stories, as I did with Mothers & Daughters..oh well! Something tells me I'll prefer Fathers & Daughters (this was advertised in this book) to the Fathers & Sons anthology, if it exists. <br /> <br />\\"Looking after Lulu\\" by Eileen Goudge starts off the volume with young Eric rebelling against his mother just after the divorce and they've all moved cities so she can find work elsewhere. Mom finally realises that Eric is just bowed down by the added responsibility of having to be the man of the house, and while the ending is bittersweet, it's a real life look at how people have to cope in broken families. <br /> <br />Eric Jerome Dickey's \\"Fish Sammich with Cheese\\" is about a little boy who lives with foster parents, and how his birth mother comes one day to pick him up in what she figures is going to be a get-rich scheme. Parental irresponsibility figures highly in this story, and how the child gets back to his foster parents is heartwarming. <br /> <br />Diana Gabaldon's \\"Mirror Image\\" has got to be the best story in the collection. Set in a fantasy world, this whodunnit involves royalty, twin brothers, and convoluted family relationships. This book should be read for this story alone. <br /> <br />\\"Finding Rose\\" by Maxine O'Callaghan isn't among the stories I liked, but is still acknowledged as a good story. Sean's father is rapidly going senile and has his stepmother to look after him, but Sean still wonders about why his own mother abandoned him when he was five. He finally decides to look for her, and while he doesn't get definite answers, he gets enough of one to realise that she probably never did abandon him after all. <br /> <br />Eileen Dryer's \\"Variations on a theme\\" is an equally good story. She writes about her changing relationship with her son from babyhood up till the time he gets married, and how the phrase \\"I love you\\" can mean so many different things over the years.  <br /> <br />The other stories are probably best read if you're interested in the authors' lives. I wanted a bit more distance away from real life and was only able to get it with fewer than half of the stories from this book.	2005-04-17
US	49198591	R11VUTLJQNEZLB	0821778315	4149739	The Naked Duke (Zebra Debut)	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Surprisingly good	I used to think of Zebra Historical Romances as being insipid reading, stories without much passion or plot. I've changed my mind with the Naked Duke. <br /> <br />Sally MacKenzie has written an enjoyable story that compares well with the historicals I normally read. She goes in-depth into the main characters, outlines the secondary characters with a touch of eccentricity, and rounds everything out with a nice, solid plot. In a world where a number of popular authors rely on the most outrageous characters to carry their stories through, finding a book where the characters are relatively normal and where the writing isn't pretentious or boring is rare indeed. <br /> <br />In capsule form, American Sarah Hamilton agrees to return to her father's family in England when her dying father, her only relative in Philadelphia, asks her to do so.  <br />On reaching London, she ends up at an inn with no luggage and is about to be turned away when she is shown a nice, empty room by a slightly tipsy gentleman. She wakes up to find a naked man in bed with her, screams and is then discovered by the said man's relatives... <br /> <br />The usual insipid regency would go through the fait accompli of needing to get married because her reputation is thoroughly ruined - end of story. Sarah quite refuses to accept such an English solution, and how she eventually adapts to the ton and accepts her love for James is a pleasure to read, even though (like all romances) it's quite clear they'll live happily ever after. The plot is also made more interesting by the introduction of a villain, and how (of course) he is outwitted by Sarah and James.  <br /> <br />Though the story of The Naked Duke is not really new, the writing gelled the whole story pretty well and made it a good read. MacKenzie was able to spark my interest in the other secondary characters, and I'd hope to see more about them in subsequent stories. <br /> <br />One of the few hiccups of the story for me was over the villain. Idid feel that MacKenzie painted him too black, which is much easier to do than to create a villain who is basically good but with character flaws whom you can both hate and sympathise with at the same time. Having said that there is a secondary villain whom I did both hate and sympathise with. I think his story will be in the pipeline:) <br /> <br />I also felt that there was a bit too much passion in this particular story. James goes around in a state of lust almost all through the book and while yeah, historicals should have lust in them, almost every coherent thought he had about Sarah was tinged with it. It would have been a perfectly nice story without so much sex, though I admit I often skip through the sex scenes in historicals to get on with the main story, so others may disagree with me here. <br /> <br />MacKenzie's challenge will be to create more intricate plots. It's hard to find one that hasn't been done before, or worse, one that's already been done to death; but I really hope she'll try. Definitely worth reading, though it didn't move me the way a 'keeper' novel might.	2005-03-16
US	49198591	R2EALDXVMAA43Z	0373770065	163839408	The Butler Did It (HQN Books)	Books	2	11	13	N	N	Disappointed	I liked the title, I liked the blurb, I liked the premise, I like Kasey Michaels, I love historical romances, but I hated this book. <br /> <br />The premise was wonderful - a butler realizes his master, the Marquis of Westham, isn't going to be in London indefinitely, so why not trade on his master's name and the location of the townhouse, and let it out like a hotel for the season? The staff gets some extra money, and the guests get to say they're staying at an exclusive location, with a marquis. What a story to sink one's teeth into! <br /> <br />The book starts when the marquis decides he needs to find a wife and makes the trip to London, just after an assortment of eccentrics settle into his house. There're the impoverished Cliffords, including heroine Emma, her mother who Speaks in Capitals, her wastrel brother, and a sly grandmother; there's a newly-rich seamstress, out to enjoy her money, and a conman itching to dupe Londoners.  <br /> <br />That's seven main characters, just way too many for an enjoyable romance, and that's without counting the marquis' valet, the butler and the rest of his staff, the marquis' friends, the suitors for Emma, as well as the people everyone meets in the course of the season - all of whom seem to have their own completely independent subplots.  <br /> <br />First off, the story would have worked better if Ms Michaels had included fewer major characters, or concentrated more on the plot of boy-meets-girl, relegating the other characters to much more minor roles. It might also have worked better if there was more synergy across characters. <br /> <br />With almost everyone in a major role, there seemed to be extraneous dialog and unnecessary introspection, and a lot of jarring shifts between plots, which had me skipping pages from the 2nd third of the book. Worse, the choice of words didn't seem to set the proper mood. Typical is \\"Morgan felt about as welcome in his own house as a rat catcher showing up with his sack at the frontdoor..\\"  <br /> <br />I found it impossible to finish the book, even skipping pages just to read what happened to Morgan and Emma. The problem was that the plot was completely unbelievable. You have grandmother Clifford who is completely amoral. The hero's staff seem utterly uninterested in doing a good job, and Morgan just sighs and lives with it.  <br /> <br />There are successful historicals with the craziest premises, but they have fewer characters and better writing. Ms Michaels might be able to get away with making this a screenplay for a TV movie, but it didn't work as a book.  <br /> <br />This is the second recent Kasey Michaels which I've not liked, the other being one of the Maggie books. Her older historicals are nice reading, but \\"Butler\\" just didn't cut it for me.	2005-01-30
US	49198591	RPF2PMW83EUAL	0425191788	301916690	Sunshine	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Just perfect	I really loved Rose Daughter so I bought Sunshine, even though I didn't really want to read yet another vampire tale. I liked the early Anne Rice vampire chronicles, and the early Laurell Hamiltons, and that pretty much spoiled me for any other vampire stories. <br />The first thing that struck me was how contemporary this story sounded. McKinley usually sets her stories in a clear fairytale world, and Sunshine is set in a future where there's modern technology and all kinds of newfangled jargon to describe it. It's also a future of vampires, were-animals, demons and then some, which reminded me quite forcibly of the universes for Hamilton's Anita Blake and of course Tanya Huff's Vicky Nelson. <br />One of the male interests is a vampire, just like it is for Blake and Nelson. Sunshine discovers new powers through her alliance with her vampire, just as with Blake, and speaks in the 1st person as well. <br />That's where things start to diverge. Sunshine comes from a very detailed universe, whereas the other authors' books tended (irritatingly) to add more details as the sequels grew. It looks likely that Sunshine is just the beginning of a whole series of books, and I'd love that.  <br />It's a potent mix of ingredients: food (Sunshine loves baking), magic, family, enigma, mystery and romance. Sunshine the heroine is one wonderful lady who discovers a lot about the people she's known for years, and then some. She also remembers that she has magical powers and extends them through Constantine. She never claims to be superwoman but comes pretty close, and McKinley's writing is so good, you live her hopes and fears. <br />I hope to see sequels that involve more about McKinley's Constantine. He came across for me as a really nice guy, though it's hard to warm to a description of stagnant pond eyes and odd smells and dead mushroom skin. It would be nice to see things from his angle as well, as there wasn't much explanation of why he did what he does, especially towards the end. Did some of these come about because he partnered with Sunshine, perhaps? <br />Then there's Mel with his magical tattoos. What of Sunshine's dad? I can't wait for the next book in this series.	2004-12-18

At least 2 of the stories are 4-star; the others are 3.  <br />I bought this book because of Carlyle and James, two of my favourite authors. But it was Alexander's story I enjoyed most: she's funny and I look for that in my romance reading. I've read her before and don't recall it being very witty..perhaps it's time to check again. <br />Carlyle's story, which hinges on misunderstandings, also sparkled, and while James' story was pretty passionate I couldn't really sympathise with Genevieve's motives. I've mentioned elsewhere that Maxwell isn't a favourite author and I found her story to have an ordinary plot, with predictable progress. People looking for passion will find plenty of it in her story though.	2004-12-13

While they involve the same characters in both stories, these books couldn't have been more different. <br />I found Hero to be more serious, but Scoundrel no less enjoyable for being a lighter read.  <br />Saint is introduced as a bad boy with an edge of sarcasm in his words, but slowly grows to know himself better through the seduction of Evie. Evie meanwhile starts off as a doormat for her brother, and gradually realises her independence through charity work - and Saint.  <br />Be warned that there is a mercenary feel to this story - Saint and Evie spend a lot of the time trading favours for this and that, albeit for different reasons, but then her brother Victor is equally mercenary - Enoch never fails to remind the reader that every move Evie makes will bring him votes in return. <br />The one jarring note was the kidnapping. I didn't think Evie achieved very much with it, other than allowing Saint a hold over her, so it didn't need to have gone on for so long. <br />Nevertheless, a good read, and worth the time spent on it.	2004-12-13

I started with this third book and was immediately captivated by all members of the Carroway family, as well as the way Lucinda's friends all come to their rescue. <br />This is Robert's story, more so than Lucinda's, and the way he decides to get back to normal life deserves respect. Unlike some of the other reviewers I found Robert's recovery quite credible, as I choose to believe that he'd been working toward it over the years. <br />This book didn't have as much of the charming dialog that you tend to get in Enoch's work, but Robert is quite reserved to begin with. Lucinda did pretty well on her own though. <br />Some reviewers have complained that the trilogy is formulaic but I disagree. I've read 2 out of the 3 books now and while there's a hero and a heroine and they're in love at the end of it, that's the basic framework for any romance story.	2004-12-13

Then let everyone be related to each other, the villain kidnap the child, framing the superhero dad, who is already suspect by the superhero authorities.. <br />The story might've worked better for me with fewer characters, so Kenner could flesh them out more, and if she relied less on different superhero powers. At times the ordinary humans seemed more competent than the superheroes. I did like the ferret though, having had one before. <br />If you enjoyed the other books in the series this would definitely be a must-read. Otherwise, this is OK light reading but only if you suspend more belief than usual.	2004-12-13

It starts with a mystery, the heroine was very likeable, and it ended with a twist. More attention could have been placed on the actual development of the romance but it's an anthology so I suppose there just wasn't space. <br />Benedict's Where Dreams come True is OK, but the others.. were just unbelievable. Take Conn's story, set in 1763.

A plot where both protagonists have been married before and one has a child with a club foot does make for quite a lot of emotional baggage, so I found this book richly satisfying. <br /> <br />I'm reminded of Amanda Quick's earlier books, where the conversation is almost farcical and there's a bit of mystery mixed in.

People will buy the book for either the fantasy or the romance, or perhaps both, and be disappointed that it's not all of one or the other, or a mix. <br />I'm familiar with Delacroix and Kurland from the romance world, McKillip and Shinn from the fantasy world, and didn't expect McKillip and Shinn to be writing the romance stories, and Delacroix and Kurland to attempt something more in the fantasy side of things.  <br /> <br />I liked the snappy conversation from the Gorgon (McKillip), though yeah, it's pretty unbelievable that the hero manages to call her up from practically nothing. And it would've been really nice if they did live happily ever after.  <br />Kurland's story is not her usual fare, and I'm not surprised at the one-star ratings for her. The fairytale mode did pall, and more emphasis could've been placed on the 'present' instead. I did like the ending, though I'm not sure how sequels (this story is stamped 'prequel' all over) will read.  <br />You really need to have read Shinn's angel series to appreciate her story. It's not supposed to be blasphemous and is a welcome addition to the entire series. <br />Delacroix' Melusine story was my least favourite. It was a good attempt at dark fantasy but entirely too depressing and I wanted happy endings.  <br /> <br />Romance readers are likely to be disappointed that the stories don't follow the usual 'and they met their princes and lived happily ever after' formula, but keep an open mind.  <br />	2004-12-13

The reviews for Swordspoint and The Fall of the Kings glow, but give the wrong idea. This is a very rich world, with a good plot and lots of tantalisingly familiar legends, academic argument, sensuality and magic, but the authors mentioned in the reviews: Georgette Heyer, Oscar Wilde, Jane Austen, Dickens.. probably wouldn't have come close to this. They would have set their work in a similar society; but that would have been all, and anyone hoping to see echoes of their work would have come away disappointed.<BR>The academic arguments were a bit too erudite for me, and I'd've enjoyed the story more if there had been less of that and more about Basil and his students, or the Tremontaines, or even about Arlen and Galing. My favourite character was Jessica, and she turned up only towards the end of the book. Hopefully she gets her own story later.	2004-04-14

Rani is certainly not the girl she used to be in 'Apprentice', and the plot gets ever more complex. The love interests are getting more fleshed out, and once again, Rani gets out of an impossible situation. That's the good part.<BR>On the other hand. Rani seemed caught in circumstances beyond her control, whereas I'd've preferred that Rani get much smarter. Why bring the baby in the first place, for example? <BR>It also seemed too convenient for Rani to get out of things by absorbing a bit of magic power here and there. <BR>It'll be interesting to see how things play out from here.

US	49198591	R1TSMFTHGFXNNC	0756401577	936950714	The Sorcerer's Academy	Books	5	4	4	N	N	I loved it!	This book may have been conceptualised as a Harry Potter spinoff, but it scores way beyond HP as far as I'm concerned. I expected completely different stories along the lines of Cat Fantastic (which would also have been nice) and was pleasantly surprised to see common characters reappearing in different stories.<BR>Like HP, the stories are set in 'the present', the heroes and heroines are in their early teens, and magic exists. Unlike HP though there seemed more exploration of teen issues and scrapes that teens could quite conceivably get into, all with a magical twist.<BR>My all-out favourite was the story by Michelle West. It seemed deeper and darker than the rest, was written almost as if in a dream, and had a satisfying ending. I was disappointed that Anna didn't appear in other stories as I would have loved to find out more about her. Most of the stories were above average (kudos to Denise Little) though I didn't like the one by Robert Sheckley so much. It seemed more run-of-the-mill in contrast, removing the students completely from the school context.	2003-11-03

Having said that I would never have bothered to read Elias' story if that happened - and Elias' story is more sensitively written. You can see him growing and can truly experience his emotions. You don't feel the same for Eliza, though the male characters - William and Jonathan - are drawn much better.<br />I knew there would be two threads from the start, but expected them to converge rather than run parallel. There were tantalising echoes of one story in the other, in the choice of people's names and their attitudes, but those echoes did nothing to actually further either plot, and could have been omitted. The lamest part was the way the 11 brothers were woven into the AIDS story. They didn't impinge on Elias' life so it wouldn't have mattered if they hadn't been there.<br />Read this book on the assumption that there are 2 separate stories, and you will enjoy it. Be warned that Elias' story doesn't have a happy ending, though it has closure. <br />Nothing is ever said of what happens to the Countess, who should be justly punished, or for that matter what happens to Benjamin with his wing (does he get his arm back at night?). A sequel might be in order here.	2003-10-20

The ending didn't seem as rushed and as un-satisfying as the others, and there was a feeling of more meat to it.<br />I didn't mind the excessive descriptions of clothing so much as it's typical of historical romances, but it did seem rather untypical of Marina as painted in the first half of the book.<br />Marina didn't appear one-dimensional to me, though it seemed weird that someone supposedly intelligent couldn't have found out about her curse earlier. How come she didn't ask her parents?<BR>How come she didn't bother to find out more about the enemies her guardians had? And even if her guardians didn't want to mention Arachne, they could have asked her to beware of evil relatives.<br />The book did fall apart for me towards the end: it would have been nice to flesh out the romance; it wasn't really clear why Arachne and Reggie needed Marina at all - it wasn't as if, Sleeping Beauty style, Arachne wanted revenge for the way she'd been treated by her family; and it didn't make any sense for Marina's parents to appear and tell her all. For that matter, why couldn't Marina's guardians have made more of an effort to get in touch with her, especially since they thought Arachne didn't have any magic?<br />It'd be nice if, romance-style, Thomas and Eleanor could have their own story told. Many of the Sensitives mentioned at the sanitarium could have their own stories too.	2003-10-15

Both stories may be set in the same universe, but MW seemed very much to be a romance with some mystery thrown in, whereas MM was more of a mystery targeted at younger readers. <br />However, I'm not sure how younger readers would actually have waded through MM when Ms Wrede could have left out at least 2 of the characters without affecting the plot any. It was also heavy going trying to follow all that thieves' jargon.<br />It's a wonderful universe though, peopled with zany characters, so I'd love to see more adventures, either involving Kim and Mairelon, or perhaps some of the other characters mentioned in passing (this is awfully popular with the romance writers, after all).	2003-10-07

Ms Balogh builds psychological layers onto her characters and always provides some kind of closure at the end - the characters often find out something new about themselves, and/or some secret that makes them more complete. <br />This also added a more-than happy ending as Lauren managed to get past her hangups about Lily.	2003-09-29

I loved only part of one sub-plot of this book- Dean, Austin and the mummy, and that isn't enough to love the whole book. Claire's ok in parts, but I didn't really see why she had to do the beach thing and the Egyptian otherworld thing. Lance was over-done and I didn't catch the Australian jokes.<br />I didn't mind the lesbian thingy - at least I understood that part. Most of the time I just couldn't figure out what was going on, especially since Sam and Austin were separated from Claire and Diana so there were 5 threads to follow, none of which seemed to converge much.<br />Things made a twisted kind of sense in the 1st 2 books, maybe because the plots were simpler. Some of those rules are also found in this book, but somehow I couldn't follow out how the mall(s) worked in this story. <br />And while it's Diana's story, she doesn't come across as the heroine. I was hoping that Diana would find her feet as a keeper. She still comes across as a nasty immature and (sigh) impotent person. I need heroines I can like.<br />Ms Huff is definitely capable of better. I'd buy the next book in the series if it's about Claire. Even if it's a better Diana in a sequel, I shudder to think of wading through all that teen-speak. It's hard enough to follow as it is, and it'll only become dated.	2003-09-29

But the paperback, even with fewer footnotes, was hard going.<BR>The threads never came together satisfactorily and the plot was ridiculous. I don't mind christianity vs satanism in a book butin this one it made the characters extremely one-dimensional and just didn't gel with the magic mixed with voodoo. <BR>How is Sarah supposed to prevent the People's decimation with or without the Sahoya's help? Why is the chief's son courting her? What exactly did the Grail do? The book raised loads of questions and answered none--the authors would have done better taking out most of these plot devices. <BR>I'll read other books by both authors--just not the ones they co-author.	2002-08-27

The endings all have a twist in them and it's worth turning the page just to find out how bad things have gotten.<BR>You do have to suspend your sense of reality though. Becky's financial troubles are novel enough to be amusing in book 1, but by book 2 you're wondering why she hasn't cut back yet.<BR>But anyone who has taken a deep breath and spent a fortune on something-you-simply-must-have and then left it to collect dust afterward will be able to identify with her.	2002-08-27
US	49198591	RWM9WDR02PMUB	0061097357	552359034	The Floating Girl	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Rei was a turnoff for me	I haven't read any of the previous books, and when I opened this one, I liked a Japan I could recognise; but the style became really tiresome by the time I was halfway through the book. Who cares for a litany of brand names after a while? The story would have worked equally well without them.<BR>And I was pretty put off by a Rei Shimura who made incredible leaps of 'intuition'. Japan's full of people. Why should any particular passerby be the people she's looking for? <BR>It's a mystery. There are bound to be wrong conclusions and red herrings along the way. But with the way Rei makes her conclusions, I couldn't even respect her as a detective.<BR>All in all, disappointing. Perhaps Massey's earlier, and later work's better.	2002-04-17
