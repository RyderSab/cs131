Robert Graham, a millionaire, had an idea to protect the human race from genius extinction. He'd open the \\"Repository for Germinal Choice\\", a sperm bank that would find it's donors among Nobel Prize winners. Women would line up in droves to get some super sperm and begin to produce future scientists, inventors and future leaders of America. The book weaves three sections: the history of Graham and the practice of artificial insemination, the donors, and finally the children that resulted.<br /><br />Plotz manages to inject enough humor in the investigative reporting that the book moves along at quite a clip, feeling like a cross between a B science fiction movie, and a missing persons thriller. Ultimately it's the human element of the parents and children that anchors the story, and gives the overall book it's melancholic heart.	2005-10-12

For me the book runs more in less in tandem with it's predecessor in both themes and interest. This time a young man, Liir, who may or may not be the son of the water logged witch of the West, sets out to find his possible half sister, his identity, and his destiny. Politics are still rampant with a nod to our current administration and culture in the U.S., as Oz seems gripped by with religious mania. The misleading element of this book is for anyone who has seen the \\"loosely based\\" musical and pick this up expecting the same light hearted fluff, will be in for a shock. The book I found, is slow going at times, and demands your undivided attention. It's also heavier themes of identity, courage, and self acceptence might turn some people off who are merely looking for an extension of either the original source material, or the Broadway show. However,if you're a fan of the original book, you'll probably find much to like in this as well. And by the end, he clearly sets the story up to continue if needed.	2005-10-08

First off I am so glad it's been written. So glad that there is something that can be put into other people's hands that examines this ridiculous opposition to gay marriage with a sense of humor, heart, and a little thing called facts. (Something the Christian right likes to forget about in their pursuit of oh so compassionate discrimination.) What I love about the book is he doesn't moralize, and tell anyone what they should do, instead it's simply the journey that he and his boyfriend Terry go through. That process manages to create a myriad of viewpoints that structures much of the book's backbone, from his pressuring Mother, to his brother adopting a somewhat \\"gay lifestyle\\" in regards to co-habitating with his girlfriend, and their somewhat open relationship.<br />My son is two and it can be incredibly frustrating and sad listening to these Bible Thumping Red State Imbeciles spouting just plain lies in the name of Jesus to create a political victory.  Luckily this book was a reminder that regardless of what careless and nasty things have been said or will continue to be said about gays and their rights to marriage and children, love is ultimately what makes a family. Love makes a commitment, and sometimes that's loud enough to drown out all the other white noise.	2005-10-04

The same can be said for this I guess, but in the much more specific microcosm of mainly fire island.Threaded together by a narrator named Bud, the book becomes collected stories from his friends and their varied experiences in and out of love. I couldn't help but wish by the end that the book was a simple straight narrative as opposed to short stories. The problem was that while some were very entertaining, others I found boring, and 22 years after it's been published the ideas no longer resonate as fresh. I think for me, the book is best approached as a time piece of a culture that morphs as quickly as the lights on the dance floor.	2005-09-30

I remember liking it, although I struggled, especially with the lack of punctuation. That exists in this as well, but it didn't bother me in the least. In fact it seemed to aid in the relentless pace that gets set right from the get go. It seems so pretentious to call a book a 'literary thriller' but between bouts of bloodshed are passages about the nature of man, this ailing country, and where it's all headed, that I suspect won't be found in the pages of a James Patterson book. It's violent, tautly written and thought provoking. Quite a good book.	2005-09-26

Longing, regret & tragedy are the trade marks of her novels and this is no exception. A young bride the morning after her marriage discovers her husband has thrown himself into Niagra Falls.

The perfect catch. Except he also happens to be a sociopath who occasionally veers off the road of sanity and dismembers someone. The plus side is that his victims are always the dregs of society; Child molesters, and monsters who prey on the innocent. So in devine retribution, Dexter preys on them. What makes this book stand out in a densely populted genre, is the voice of the charming and often hiliarious anti-hero. Showtime is developing this character for an original series starring 'Six Feet Under's' Michael C Hall, who just might be the perfect casting choice for this wonderfully witty and twisted character.	2005-09-09

Harry is back on the force, paired with Kiz Rider, and assigned to the unsolved case division. Their first cold case involves a sixteen year old mixed race girl who was found murdered near her home seventeen years ago. The killer or killers were never found, and the case was left sitting with many unanswered questions; Questions that Harry is going to find the answers to,despite some secrets that want to stay buried. I guess what made the book so good to me was that Harry seemed so invigorated and refreshed it took the dourness, that I think pervaded some of the previous novels, out. It's just nice to see that after fourteen novels Connelly can still turn out a great read.	2005-09-05

I'd heard alot of people talk about what a great writer David McCullough is, and how he made his subject matter 'accessible'. Unfortunately, that didn't move the John Adams bio off my book shelf and any closer to my hands. So I thought try this instead. You know what? All those people are right. He is great, and the subject matter is accessible. He turned something which could be as dry as the Sahara into an oasis. And as thrilling as it was in it's suspenseful retelling, the biggest thing I got out of all of it was how grateful and proud I am to be an American and the true meaning of freedom.	2005-08-30

Precious is concerned Mr J.L.B. Metekoni will never go through with his promise of marriage, and Mr J.L.B. has his own concerns about a fundraising stunt he gets roped into. The main case Precious takes is the weakest part of the book seeing as she's to investigate the intentions of four suitors to a wealthy business woman, yet at the end of the book had only seen two and the story concluded. However, this small complaint didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of a series that continues to warm the heart and soul.	2005-08-24

Four people who couldn't be more different in their day to day lives find they have something in common when they all prepare to jump off a famous London building known for suicides. That they don't, becomes the lift off point of the novel as these broken individuals connect with each other and parts of themselves. Four different souls: Martin, a morning television personality who was imprisoned after having sex with a minor, Jess, a turbulant teen, who has a bone to pick with anyone who'll listen, JJ a washed out American musician, and Maureen, an older woman caring for her son who is a vegetable. The premise sounds horribly depressing, but you'd be surprised how funny it is at times. The narrative shifts between the four players, some working more successfully than others, namely Maureen's who I felt had the most satisfying and interesting character arc. The book has some unexpected and funny turns and manages to be heartfelt without dipping into sentimentality. A good summer read.	2005-08-15

If you enjoyed Michael Cunningham's section on Virginia Woolf in 'The Hours', than you might enjoy this as well. Beautiful written, but very measured in pace, the book wonderfully captures the heart and mind of the writer Henry James. I'll admit that beyond 'Portrait of a Lady' I haven't read anything else he's written, and I'm sure if I had it would add a whole other dimesion to the book. As it stands it's still quite enjoyable, even if it requires a bit of patience.	2005-08-09

Both 'A Prayer for Owen Meany' and 'The Cider House Rules' are fantastic timeless classics that will secure him as our modern day Dickens. After the disapponting \\"Fourth Hand\\" I had high hopes for this book. Yet for the first time with an Irving book I found myself getting bored.<br /><br />Jack Burns, a famous actor, searches for the father who abandoned he and his mother when he was a small boy. In classic Irving style there are a myriad of colorful characters who populate the novel, but having read everything else he's written, so many themes from  previous novels are re-worked (sexual abuse the most dominant)that it feels like Irving is trying to wrestle his own demons and needs to take advice given to Jack and, \\"Forgive and move on.\\"<br /><br />However the biggest problem for me was I felt no connection with Jack. For the first time I felt I was reading about someone I couldn't care less about, so any supposed emotional wallop at the end was lost. I never felt there was an Owen or Wilbur in the whole book. Even Emma Oastler,who is one of the novel's best characters, pales in comparison to the very similar Hester Eastman, from Owen Meany.<br /><br />The book has some great laugh out loud moments, (in particular Jack's attending an all girl school in Toronto),if you can get beyond the strong sexual abuse and misuse that occurs rather frequently in the first 400 pages. Anyone who is a rabid Irving fan will want to read it and judge for themselves, but for a first timer, I'd strongly suggest the two superb novels I mentioned earlier.	2005-08-02

I felt this was a fantastic chapter in the series. For me what made it so wonderful was it didn't feel like it was following the same formula of the previous years/books:  The opening with the Dursleys, arriving at the school, and the \\"new\\" teacher every year who came with their own quirks and secrets. So much of this book is between Harry and Dumbledore that I found myself enjoying the break from what was becoming a bit routine. Harry has also seemed to mature past the petulant and angry brat he had been in the last novel and has now found a focus for his anger, that allows him to at least have moments with his friends like he used to. The book is darker than any of the previous ones, but it would almost have to be to continue to engage kids who started this series nearly eight years ago and are now transfixed by Xbox and Playstation. That's not to say it's excessively violent, but the violence when it occurs feels right in the context of the story. It certainly will be interesting to see how she wraps it all up. Without giving anything away, she seems to have opened an avenue that can lead Harry and Co., anywhere for the finale.	2005-07-22

Suddenly the momentum that had been building seemd to come to a screeching halt.However the book does manage to find it's way back, and comes to a fairly satisfying conclusion. There's no reason why this book won't continue to be a big hit regardless, since it feels like the love child of 'The Davinci Code' and 'Dracula'. Elizabeth Kostova does a great job of balancing three narratives that all involve searching for someone beyond the big fanged kahuna.

Yes, there is plenty of beautiful simple writing,however, the plot seemed to languish between  passages of keen observation on faith and life, and love, and death. It just didn't hold my interest.

An Oscar winner for his wonderful screenplay of 'Gosford Park' this satiric stab at the upper crust of British society is great fun, and a pleasure to read. The nameless narrator, a witty actor and wry observationist, befriends Edith Lavery, an attractive if slightly average woman itching to move from her ho- hum existance to the Royal lap of luxury. What follows is her steep ascent and almost as rapid descent, told through various dinners and social gatherings where the elite go to play, or at the very least be seen. The whole time reading I felt I had been steeped in a Merchant Ivory picture, or was sitting with the cast of 'Four Weddings and A Funeral' as their voices bobbed through my head. The story is very simple, serving as a backdrop to the larger strokes he paints about class and society, much like Alan Hollinghurst's 'The Line of Beauty'. The difference between the two is in tone, where Hollinghurst's is bleak, this is like a breath of fresh air.	2005-06-04

A big departure from the Goth meets \\"Dawson's Creek\\" angst of his previous two novels, this comes off more like something gay mystery writer John Morgan Wilson would have penned. A handsome gay journalist has a recent ex who seems to have disappeared. Or was it murder? This is only the tip of a dense and at times quite convoluted plot that includes child abuse, drug and alcohol addiction, pedophilia, murder, and drug smuggling. Did I mention this is not a happy story? Still, I think Rice is maturing as a writer, and this is his most confidant and assured work yet,even if the subject matter and despicable characters may turn alot of people off.	2005-05-29

I have to admit, I was slightly embarrassed to find it listed in the romance section, but was determined to read it anyway. I'm really glad I did. Barring the necessary sex passages that lovingly describe muscular loins, the book is really more historical than out and out romance. Claire Randall is a former combat nurse at the end of the second world war. Recently reunited with her husband, they are vacationing on the Bristish Isles when she is transported through a circle of stones to war battered Scotland. My one quip with what I otherwise thought was a very enjoyable (if not a bit too long) book, was the premise of her having two husbands in two very different times. Her husband is only in the first fifty pages of a nearly nine hundred page book. So unless he returns in later books, it's really her courtship and relationship with the Scotish warrior Jamie Fraser that the book is about. Still, I'm very curious to see where the series goes,  if her husband Frank returns, and where Claire and jamie will escape to next. For those who want an enjoyable escapist read ripe with sex and 'Braveheart' type violence, this is your book!	2005-05-23

While there, on the imagined Carolina hideaway Egret Island, she meets a handsome Benedictine Monk named Whit who has a tragic past. A passionate love affair begins, which puts her marriage/life, and his vows at risk. I just couldn't connect with the book. For the the first two thirds, I felt Jesse was selfish and never felt it really redeemed itself. Chapters of the novel, (about three) are from Whit's perspective,and his story I found the more interesting of the two; What led this man to this place, and what was he searching for spiritually as well as secularly. By the time the book wrapped up, I felt, like in the exploration and explanantion of this love affair there was not enough preceding it to justify it. The end felt easy and neatly wrapped up. Ultimately the book felt like a big fat romance novel in the guise of literature. I'd recommend reading 'The Thorn Birds' and renting 'Splash' instead.	2005-05-09

David Mitchell wrote one of my favorite books, \\"Ghostwritten\\". That was a tran-satlantic crossing that started in Tokyo and ended in Manhattan. The stories were loosley threaded together which is somewhat what he does here. I can only compare the two books and say while I liked this book, I did find some of the sections (particularly the middle), quite difficult to really hook into. With Ghostwritten each story was as fascinating as the one before. Here, while I marvelled at his ability to tackle six very diffrent genres of story telling in six very different locales, I was left a bit removed as he moved into the not so distant future. That said,  I do believe he is one of the great writers today, and one that more people should be talking about.	2005-05-03

Growing up in the seventies has ever been more unglamorously or accurately depicted as in Meg Wolitzers brilliant, funny, and touching saga of the Mellow family. Paul and Roz Mellow write a book akin to 'The Joy Of Sex' which they end up being the models for. The book becomes a massive bestseller, and changes their lives. However one evening the children pore over the pages  of the book together, and witness their parents in poses that one never hopes or could even imagine their parents being in. The shock waves from this reverberates into each of their adult lives. I fell in love with these characters. They were all so real and so identifiable, you can't help see parts of your own family in theirs. I also found the book hard to put down, which is always, to me anyway, the sign of a really great book.	2005-04-22

I can only say that from a truly base emotional level the book truly affected me. There is no question in my mind it won't be for everyone, and as much as I'd love to share it with as many people I know, it's non-linear and nearly multimedia presentation will be offputting to many. Pictures fill the book, as well as pages that are blank, and pages containing only one sentence. At the start I found the shifting narrative between Oskar and his grandparents at times confusing. His story is about the loss of his father in 9/11, and his attempt to find the lock that matches a key his father has left behind. Their stories are about losing themselves and each other in the aftermath of the Allied invasion of Dresdin Germany. It's not a book you can pick up and put down. There are long passages devoid of paragraphs that are essentially a vomiting of consciousness, that go on for pages at a time, and can feel exhausting by the time you finish. Yet it's all very deliberate, and by the end of the novel Foer manages to thread together all it's various ends so successfully, and build each story to such an emotional crescendo I couldn't keep my eyes dry. Obviously the book begins with such a raw chord in September 11th, but I never felt that he was manipulating my emotions or writing something simply for effect. For me the book really is about people searching after loss. Whether that's searching for love, for a physical or emotional connection, or simply a lock for a key.	2005-04-16

I think the reason was, a new character is introduced, and his story is the focus of the book rather than our hero Twig. For me it would be like reading the first three Harry Potter books, and then the fourth book deals mainly with Ron.<br />The action picks up right where the last ended and the beginning packs enough action to keep you turning the pages.Twig must now save the entire Edge from destruction from a Mother Storm that is headed on a collision course with Sanctaphrax. It was a fine book. I just felt a bit disappointed that Twig was mostly a background player in what I thought were his tales. Still it's worth reading if you've read the first two, and the illustrations are once again top notch.	2005-04-09

Cross the eerie,'the Sixth Sense' with the stream of conscious narrative of, 'The Curious Incident of the Dog At Night time', and you'l have entered Louis Drax's world. A nine year old boy lies in a coma after a terrible fall. His mother is the only witness to the incident which she blames on her husband, claiming he pushed their son. Problem is, the husband has vanished, and the only other person who can tell what happened is buried deep in the catacombs of his mind. The book is wonderfully suspenseful with  gothic overtones, and enough tension and human drama you'll want to finish in one or two sittings. I also appreciated that for the most part it kept me guessing up until the very end.	2005-04-01

All of the stories run on a somewhat familiar terrain of love, longing, regret,and betrayal, three of the eight centering on the same woman at different stages of her life.

The great news is that Elvis Cole is back. Personally I think he is one of the best written private detectives in the mystery genre today. And what would be Elvis without the enigmatic, complex, and darkly funny Joe Pike. Unfortunately he's just a blip in this outing which is a shame because he's a brilliant character. Crais has his formula of mixing Elvis' narrative with the killers point of view, which this time wasn't quite as successful to me, however this a minor quibble in what ultimately is another rich chapter in Elvis Cole's turbulent life.	2005-03-17

Finishing it, that was roughly what it was about, but overall it's an ecological debate wrapped up in a techno-thriller crust. The book also deals heavily with our culture of fear, and how the media propagates our collective paranoia about crime, and central to this book, the potential deadly hazards of global warming. My only quip with the novel is that the characters sometimes are portrayed in very stock ways, to further his arguments. Yet this is a small blip on what is otherwise a very entertaining and thought provoking book.	2005-03-10
US	52978794	RJO5M5K3Q8QQ	1582345082	570121918	The Line of Beauty	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Great Writing	What really amazed me about this book and Alan Hollighurst as a writer, is his incredible power of observation and perception, and the way it's done with the fewest words possible. Set in London in the mid eighties, the book centers on Nick, a young gay man coming of age among the often snooty upper crust of the London political and social circles.<br /><br />As a social satire the book is brilliant, never veering off into the trap of easy stereotypes, but instead subtly skewering them with biting humor and precision. The book manages to capture a wide range of topics from class structure, to the division of race and sexuality, and although the ripple effects of the plot have devastating consequences, I still felt a sense of hope by the end.<br /><br />It's a novel that hopefully will trancend the confines  of a \\"gay literature\\" label, and simply be remembered as a  great and superbly written work.	2005-03-04

'Dry' surprised me with how funny someone could make recovery. After finishing 'Magical Thinking' I think I have a bit of a crush on Augusten Burroughs. With past comparisons to David Sedaris, this collection of true stories is closer in form and tone than anything else he's written. Laugh out loud funny, irreverent, and sometimes downright crude, this is the collection that people will be passing around, recommending to friends, and secure for him a legion of rabid fans waiting patiently for whatever comes next.

John O'Hara is the agent watching her, who in the process gets more involved than he should. My disappointment with the book is that most everything is laid out right from the start in an almost paint by numbers pattern.The \\"twists\\" when they come are mostly minor plot points,one of which seems pretty obvious from the start.  Having only read one other Patterson, I don't have much to compare in terms of his other works, but in relation to other thriller writers, I think Robert Crais or Dennis Lehane craft a more original thriller with more powerful turns.	2005-02-14

To do that would limit the scope of the book. Beyond the mystery or mysteries to be solved, this time revolving around an American woman searching for her long lost son, there is much political and social commentary which can be both humorous and touching depending on the circumstances. Told with a simple, direct style, Precious Ramotswe becomes even more endearing in this book, and her supporting cast of characters like her fiance Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, and her secretary Mme Makutsi,manage to root a place in your heart as well.	2005-02-08

Bill, Sookie's vampire boyfriend, is called away on mysterious business. Yet it's only a matter of time before she discovers Bill has actually disappeared, and vampire Eric enlists her to go find him. Where the book was sloppy for me was the introduction of Bill's long lost vampire love who may be involved in the kidnapping. Her appearance is so brief, and what becomes of it is barely dealt with. There are also, at this point, so many men in Sookie's life, you have to wonder why she stays with Bill. But I guess, that's what makes her and the series interesting.	2005-02-06

This was published at the very end of 2004 and for me it's the best of last year and probably this year as well. Billed as \\"an epic novel about obsessive love in an age of obsessive materialsim\\", the basic thrust of the story is about a man who never having gotten over a woman who left him ten years before, kidnaps her son.<br /><br />The brilliance of the novel is in it's construction. The book is segmented in seven parts, each narrated by a different player in the unfolding drama with sections and scenes overlapping in a 'Rashomon' like narrative. The only criticism I have with the book echos other reviewers, that many of the characters voices are similar. They all seem cut from the same Mensa cloth,being incredibly insightful,bright,and in tune with the human condition regardless of age, sex, or social standing.However as criticisms go, it's a small one, and one that doesn't detract from the awesome magnitude or scope of what I think is a phenomenal piece of literature.	2005-02-03
US	52978794	R3D5HTWFUZHYPB	0670033448	9843603	The Inner Circle	Books	3	3	4	N	N	A Fine Companion Piece To The Feature	The first thing that struck me while reading this was the remarkable similarities between it and Bill Condon's screenplay for the movie \\"Kinsey\\". Kinsey's naive and idealistic assistant John Milk follows so much of the same path as Peter Sarsgaard's character in the movie,it was almost as if I was reading a novelization of the film. The major difference is Sarsgaard is single, while Boyle's protagonist is grappling with being a husband and a father all the while continuing his work for Kinsey with a near brainwashed zeal.<br />I think the fact that I had already seen the movie added to my enjoyment of the book. It certainly peaked my interest in reading it to begin with, although I loved \\"Drop City\\". What I found a tad disappointing is I can't say I really liked John Milk. Even with a first person narrative I found him weak, an attribute he points out in himself. Consequently I found a falseness to where he ends up, and by the time I had finished was left a bit numb. As a companion piece to the movie I think it's an interesting compliment. By itself, I don't know that I would've enjoyed it quite as much.	2005-01-18

The only similarities between the two is England and the word magician. I only say this because people who pick this up expecting the quick and accessible world of Hogwarts are in for a shock.<br />A better reference point would be, 'Charles Dickens with magic.'<br />The book is long and dense, with many footnotes and a deliberately paced plot. However, I was never the least bit bored, and found myself thoroughly engrossed with these characters, and what happens to them. The plot in a nutshell revolves around two magicians, Mr Norrell, and his student Jonathan Strange. Coming at the world of magic from two very different views, an incident happens towards the beginning of the novel that shapes the course of the entire story and both the mens lives.<br />There are a multitude of subplots that while reading I had no idea how they related directly to the main thrust of the story, but by the end she does a marvelous job of weaving them all together.<br />The book definitely requires some patience, but the payoff is so worth it. After nearly eight hundred pages I felt completely satisfied with the ending. And that says alot. Time well spent .	2005-01-12

The book breaks the mystery tradition of a detective solving one case over the course of a novel, and instead drops us into her daily routine, and the many varieties of cases she's called upon for.

That's a tall compliment, because at the very least, \\"The Davinci Code\\" is a engaging read. This,I'm sorry to say,bored me to tears by the end. It started promising enough, with an ancient manuscript holding clues to something that men would kill for. Once the prologue ended and the setting moved to modern day Princeton I felt like I had just downed three Sominex.<br /><br />The characters were drawn so poorly there was nothing to really distinguish any of them except skin color or sex. The plot became nothing more than an overwritten set of word and math riddles, which run along the same lines of those old school math questions like: If a car travels across the country at the same rate of a train but only half as fast which would get there faster? Um, like this question, the book answer is the same: Who cares. The only reason I gave the book two stars was I had hope in the first fifty pages or so the book would become engrossing.<br /><br />It didn't.	2004-12-17

The similarities are there: the comic overtones to a tragic situation, an eccentric family, and most importantly a collection of characters you grow to love.<br /><br />\\"The Laments\\" has all of that. A horrible accident leads to Julia and Howard Lament leaving the hospital with a baby that is not biologically theirs. Young Will Lament is raised without the knowledge of his birthright, and soon what begins in South Africa, ends in America with their growing family staking their indvidual claims before they're uprooted agin by the whimsy of Howard.<br /><br />Yes, the book feels similar in tone to something that Irving would write,yet it has enough of its own uniqueness to stand apart.

Someone has given the end away in one of theirs, and after coming through six other books, and going through this last nearly nine hundred pages, you should reward yourself with discovering the ending yourself and not by some careless reviewer. That being said, did the book turn out like I expected or wanted? Absolutely not. Does that take away from it's enjoyment? Not for me. With any long series there up ups and downs. I can say at least King finished it, even if many people don't perceive it as their idea of perfect.It's not like Robert Jordan's series which is at ten or beyond, with no resoultion  in sight. I did feel some things wrapped up very anticlimactically, and I found myself putting this last volume down alot. I realized towards the end it was not because I was bored, but because I didn't want it to end. That's a testament to some engaging writing and characters.

No descriptive prose, no description at all actually, simply a scripted conversation in a hotel room between two friends, Jay & Ben. At the very start Jay informs Ben he is planning to assassinate President George Bush for the war atrocities in Iraq.Your reaction to the book will probably be influenced by your own opinion of whether you think Bush and his administration were wrong to invade Iraq. I don't know if anything new is shed in the course of the argument that hasn't already been said beyond a theory of why abortion should be outlawed. However, the book is interesting at the very least as an emotional response to what many people think is a wrong and terrible war.	2004-09-24

Like other reviewers I also wished Bartimaeus had more page time as his role is greatly diminished, but it doesn't detract from what a great book this is. Highly recommended.	2004-09-22

Her husband went to jail for the crime, but now, six years later, another man has come forward claiming responsibility for the act at the same time her husband is being released from jail. As Maggie tries to stay focused in a hazy present, the past weaves the truth that hopefully will give some much needed clarity to her fragile mind. Shifting back and forth, both past and present carry their own suspenseful narratives. One of a young bride discovering the man her husband really is, and the other of a woman facing that past all over again. While the ending didn't play out how I imagined, or perhaps would've liked, it's still a fast page turning book with a wonderfully realized woman at it's core.	2004-09-11

One of the things I loved so much about this book is that these kids, and their parents are presented without apologies. Some of their actions and reactions are simply hateful, but at the same time very real and terribly funny. To top it off, there is a funny and informative glossary of Jewish terms for anyone who thinks a goyim is a part of the human anatomy.	2004-09-05

However, the story really begins when her friend never makes it back to her New York apartment, and what transpires brings Juno's own haunted past back to life; a past that includes a mentally ill husband who tried to murder she and her daughter fifteen years earlier. The book's beautiful prose adds layers to the Gothic and moody tone, and although I felt the resolution was a bit of a letdown it still was an engaging read.	2004-08-29

This was the first time I'd entered Jack Reacher's world and I can't wait to go back. Based on some other people's reviews, this book is a flash back to the start of Reachers career which makes sense once I got to the end.<br />A general is found dead near an Army base. Everything is seemingly routine, appearing he's died of natural causes, until they find his wife murdered at their home. The action plays out as fast as the rapid fire dialogue, with a do-good protagonist who has a sense of humor as well as iron fists, and a feisty female lieutenant who risks her career getting involved.My only question at the end of the book is: Why isn't this author a bigger sensation?	2004-08-25

I think it's because I was now familiar with the down home narration of Sookie Stackhouse, and the characters are really beginning to grow in interesting directions, particularly Vampire Eric. Comparisons have been made to Anne Rice for the obvious reason, but the heroine of this series comes across more like a sassy Southern version of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone, than any of the tourtured souls in the Anne Rice world.	2004-08-19

It's a love story on so many levels, the first being the love of books and the power within them. A young boy, Daniel, is taken by his father to a magical place; The Cemetery of Forgotten Books. As is the tradition the boy can choose one book which will be his to take care of. He chooses a book called, 'The Shadow of the Wind' by a mysterious author named Julian Carax. The story and it's author become somewhat of an obsession for Daniel, and before long a hideously disfigured man is demanding it's return or suffer the consequences. Gothic, romantic, and full of surprises and intrigue, it's one of the best and most original I've read this year.	2004-08-16

The only thing I knew going in was a man throws his wife off a cruise ship on their anniversary, and unbeknownst to him, she lives.

But Twig has always felt different and there's good reason: He was left as a baby, and consequently doesn't know who his real parents are. Set in a world of creatures both magical and dangerous, Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell have created a rich fantasy world with beautiful illustrations. This first book has a bit of a repetitious quality as Twig goes from one creature to the next. However, it's highly enjoyable and the ending is a huge set up for the second book in the series, which I'll be sure to read.	2004-07-25

The final section is a glimpse at Patrick as a recovered addict, navigating life while trying to put the demon of his father to rest. The technical writing is great. Beautiful witty prose, descriptive and vivid characters and smart witty dialogue. Yet I found it increasingly difficult to hang in there when I detested nearly everyone in the pages of this book. Sneering snobs, and drug addicts. Not my idea of an enjoyable read.	2004-07-20

A friend suggested I read this telling me it was a better story, and upon finishing I have to agree. After now having read his two biggest novels I've come to the conclusion Dan Brown writes the literary equivalent to the summer blockbuster movie. A huge plot that barrels along at a breakneck pace, daring and heart pounding action sequences, and characters that have stilted dialogue but are used for their specific purpose to move the plot along.(Not that there's anything wrong with that.) This involves a Harvard symbologist, called to help unravel an ancient mystery involving a secret brotherhood that is out to destroy the Catholic Church. The debate between science and religion is played against the backdrop of the Vatican city while the city itself is facing complete destruction in a matter of hours. Perfect movie setup.<br />Too bad Harrison Ford, is too old for Langdon...Dennis Quaid perhaps?	2004-07-10

The anticipation of a new collection of essays means at least an hour or two of annoying loved ones and co-workers with, &quot;one more section to read aloud&quot;.<br />However upon finishing this I only mustered up some hearty chuckles. Success hasn't spoiled Sedaris, it's just stripped him of his anonymity. Consequently placing himself in situations where he can silently observe are becoming obsolete.Most of the stories revolve around his family; a melancholic and unflattering collection of portraits that frankly I felt depressed more than amused. There are some very funny moments, but generally the absurd wit that runs through his previous essays was replaced by a sadder, softer tone. Still, fans of his work will find at least some things to giggle over, and that's more than alot of writers can say.	2004-06-30

First off I have no idea how any of this is going to turn out, and that's a good thing. So much of what surrounds this book is the fact that King writes himself into the story; In fact he's central to the plot. I closed the book and vascilated between thinking it was brilliant or just odd. Based on others reactions, I guess I'm not alone. I'll be really bummed though if the Crimson King turns out to be the driver who ran over King years ago, and yet I wouldn't put anything past him after the way the book ends. The book in hindsight almost seems like an extended coda to &quot;The Wolves of Calla&quot;. The action moves minimally to climax with the birth of Susannah/Mia/Detta's baby, and Jake and Callahan entering the bar where the birth is taking place.For those who have followed it faithfully, you'll certainly want to read this since it's by no means a drawn out mess like the Robert Jordan books have become for example.<br />Curiosity is killing this cat however, to learn what tricks King has up his sleeve to tie all this up in the last book due in September.	2004-06-25

Some of the most entertaining, original, and exciting books being published today are not by the John Grishams and the Tom Clanceys of the literary world but instead a new crop under the mantle of, \\"Young Adult Books\\". Authors like Cornelia Funke and Christopher Paolini are writing original and magical worlds that are being devoured by as many adults as young people who are looking for more beyond Harry Potter.<br />English writer Jonathan Stroud adds what I feel is one of the very best, including the Potter canon, with the first of a planned trilogy, 'The Amulet of Samarkand'.<br />Young apprentice Nathanial is frustrated by the meager teachings from his C level magician guardian. His own studies have, in his mind, already surpassed what his master knows. After a humiliating experience at the hands of a pompous colleague of his master, Nathanial plans revenge with the help of Bartimaeus, a five thousand year old djinni. Telling the story from both their perspectives as the situation careens wildly out of control, Stroud creates a wonderfully original page turner. Bartimeaus is a fanatstic character who illustrates many finer points with the help of hilarious footnotes. It's too bad the series is only a trilogy for this is a franchise I'd love to see go beyond three books.	2004-06-19

Woodward goes beyond merely relaying events, and manages to create both tension and suspense in a story that the reader already knows the outcome of. It's also interesting reading this well after the initial bombs were dropped to see what kind of fall out this operation has created in our country, especially with Tenet, and Wolfowitz. A fascinating look at the inside from one of the masters of investigative journalism.	2004-06-13

Byatt. In 'The Thing In The Forest&quot; two girls encounter a horrible creature that has resonating effects into their adult lives. In 'Body Art', a young doctors involvement with a young art student brings unexpected results. In 'A Stone Woman' (which I found the most haunting, original, and captivating)a woman slowly begins to morph into stone. &quot;Raw Material' concerns a creative writing teacher and his near obsession with the work of a student of his. Lastly,'The Pink Ribbon'(also exceptional), is about an elderly man taking care of his wife who is losing her mind. One evening a young woman shows up at their door running from someone, but it seems she might be more than she says she is. Beautiful, rich, and evocative prose move through all the stories although the two I mentioned above in parenthesis seem standouts both in content and resolution. I've heard the book categorized as modern &quot;horror&quot;, and upon finishing I can see how that general classification could happen. Yet they are much more literary works that seem to delve more into the horrors of the human mind and heart, than any external modern monster or demon that floods the pages of books today.	2004-06-05

The cat and mouse relationship that transpires between brothers plays out very much like Hannibal Lechter and Clarise Starling in the Thomas Harris books, with Jeremy giving clues as to who the killer might be, but only after Carson gives his brother a little something in return. A slightly over the top ending stretches some of the books overall solid credibility, but it's certainly entertaining, and should make a great movie since the rights have already been sold.	2004-06-03

I remember when I was young my Mother once telling me, \\"No one has the Norman Rockwell family\\", and that statement is all in evidence here. There's Todd, the once golden boy quarterback struggling to pass his bar exam and playing Mr Mom, while his wife tries to make ends meet. He meets Sarah one day at the playground who has her own problems in the marriage department since her husband is falling for an internet exhibitionist. Throw into the mix a recently released child molester, and you have the makings of some uncomfortable chuckles at the very least. The book feels painfully accurate in its portrayal of disappointment and disenchantment so many of these characters feel in the daily grinds of their lives. And it's their almost obsessive pursuits to capture a fleeting bit of what they think can bring them happiness that makes it both painful and funny at the same time.	2004-05-29

It took me nearly a year to finally pick it up, and after turning the last page, I was sorry to see it end. A wonderful virtually plotless novel that follows the simple lives of Joe and Kate Rutledge, a couple who have left their busy lives in London to lead simpler ones in the Irish countryside. What propels the book through a year is their relationships with various &quot;characters&quot; who live near and around them. The book is lyrical in its simplicity with restrained but honest emotion pulsing through its veins. I loved the way these people interacted with one another, and by the end felt I was leaving a group of old friends. In a way it reminded me somewhat of Wallace Stegner's,&quot;Crossing to Safety&quot; and like that book left me totally satisfied upon finishing.	2004-05-22

Then she meets Bill, and can't read a thing he's thinking,which is a delight in her eyes.Her inability to read him is tied to the fact that he's a vampire, which in Sookies world is as common as any other race, creed, or national origin. They are referred to as &quot;fangs&quot; versus &quot;humans&quot;, and it's not long before she's head over heels in love with him. The problem starts when bodies begin to pile up around town, and Sookie begins to fear for her life.<br />Sookie is a disarming and utterly charming character, and for me is what makes the book unique.Bill seems an interesting guy, but there's not much to him besides his lust/love for Sookie, but I'm imagining more will be revealed in subsequent books.Overall I found the tone of the book hard to classify; Is it a romance novel with an underworld twist, or a mystery novel with a romantic undercurrent? Either, both, I don't know. Whatever it is, it's amusing and worth reading providing you're not expecting Anne Rice.	2004-05-16

Robert Backus, the serial killer who prowled through the pages of &quot;The Poet&quot; is back with revenge on his mind, and it's up to Harry and FBI agent Rachel Walling to trap him.

I admit when I first bought this it was for the titilation factor; I wanted to read all the dirt on Sharon Stone and Michael Ovitz, and all the other Hollywood heavyweights he's worked with. What I didn't expect/didn't know is how much of the book would be about his young life, growing up a Hungarian immigrant in Ohio, and the struggles his family had. Nor did I expect the deep and complicated relationship with his father, or the heartbreaking recounting of the end of his first marriage. It's an epic biography. Frankly I'm surprised he's not dead after all that's happened to him. The stress alone would knock out most people.	2004-05-05

However by the time I finished I was left wanting more. The mystery surrounding who beat one time television writer and now teacher Ray Mitchell to death left me a bit cold. And when the person is revealed I can't even say I was surprised, but worse I didn't really care. I loved the book at the start and was expecting to tap into something I'd be telling eveyone to go out and buy. Again I thought the writing was great, I just didn't completely connect with this group of people, and so ultimately didn't connect with the book.	2004-04-23

A series of woven tapestries that hangs today in a museum in Paris, she blends the stories of the various weavers, artists, and noblemen who all are connected in one way or another to the art. Having not read &quot;Pearl Earring&quot; I found the book creative and refreshing.

The book runs just a little over the course of a week, with the various characters interconnected, and each chapter moving from one to the next. There's Henry, the older English thespian who's in a smash Broadway play, his love denied assistant Jessie, and her playwright brother Caleb, as well as Caleb's shallow lover Toby. For anyone who has spent time in the Manhattan theatre world or follows it closely, you may find this a fun, campy, nearly melodramatic read. It didn't seem like the same author who had written the fantastic &quot;Dr August&quot; and &quot;Father of Frankenstein&quot; since it has none of the depth of either of those books. However taken separately, it's a breezy read that brims with heart as a valentine to the the New York theatre and it's inhabitants.	2004-04-09

Set in Martirio Texas the book is narrated by 15 year old Vernon Little, a foul mouthed kid whose best friend shoots sixteen classmates and then turns the gun on himself. But the real story is what happens after, when Vernon unfairly gets linked to the murders and the circus that erupts. The author with keen and razor sharp insight satirizes small town America, the media and the public's gross infatuation with it, reality television, and even the constitution. Based on the direction this country seems to be heading at the present time I found this book more than relevant and almost a little frightening in it's accuracy.	2004-04-02

The wolves come every twenty years or so, and take one of the many sets of twins that populate the town. When the children return sometime later they are husks of their former selves, or roont as they call them. Much of the lengthy book is buildup to the eventual confrontation, but there are also character events large enough to propel the story into an entirely new direction that will obvious be what the next installment is about.If you've read and enjoyed the four books previous to this you won't be disappointed.	2004-03-29

And frankly less of a tackle, than a roll with a familiar face/voice, I thought it terrific.<br />Having just recently read Carrie Fishers &quot;The Best Awful&quot; these books were like damaged book ends that both meet in the middle at rehab. But where the bulk of Fishers book was her lack of pill popping that quickly leads to her prolonged mental breakdown, Burroughs bottoms out near the start of the book, as a successful advertising whiz kid whose normal nightly consumption is at least twelve drinks. His story is of Manhattan as seen through the eyes that couldn't see before. Or at the very least focus.

At the center of the story is a young teacher's lusty affair with one of her students. But layered with that is the narrator, (a fellow teacher, spinster, and friend of the accused) who in relaying the events, reveals her own version of obsession and love. I have to admit I found myself laughing out loud at times at Barbara's self involved observations. Yet as the book progressed, I found myself increasingly uncomfortable with all of the players and their actions, and by the end felt an overwhelming need to shower it all off.	2004-02-22

Her husband has left her for another man, her fiercely intelligent daughter is more grown up than she is, and her life keeps sputtering forward while beginning to careen wildly out of control. The book, which is filled with Fishers signature wit and dry humor, really takes flight once her illness fully manifests itself. LIke driving past an accident I found myself unable to look away as one folly built on another. Knowing how the character parallels Fishers own life, I found myself reading the book wondering what was real and what was not. A (strange to say) entertaining read.	2004-02-15

That alone was enough to make me want to read this book. Wonderfully imagined by Louis Bayard, Tim becomes obsessed with the bodies of two young girls who both bear the same brand on their bodies. It's tone and pacing are reminiscent of Caleb Carr's \\"The Alienist\\",as the mystery unfolds in London's dark underbelly. Peppered with characters from the source material it serves as a dark and thrilling \\"sequel\\" to a beloved classic. An enjoyable read.	2004-02-07

Henry and Claire are destined to be together. Henry knows this because he can travel from the past to the present and back again. He meets Claire when she is six, and again when she's in her twenties.<br />The narrative jumps from Claire's point of view to Henry's with their lives past and present playing out as Henry travels through them. At the beginning of the book the device can be a little confusing as for example Henry from the present talks with Henry from the past, but by the time you're half way through the book you get used to it much like Claire must of with his constant disappearing and reappearing. It's a big sweeping love story with two whip smart and engaging characters. if you're a literary romantic, this could be what you're looking for, and if not and time travel is your thing, I'd break open the H.G. Wells.	2004-01-14

It's rare that I say I would give something six stars if possible but this would be one of those cases. A brilliant character piece, &quot;..Falls&quot; centers around a middle aged man named Miles Roby, a manager of a diner in Empire Falls Maine. A blue collar textile mill town that is fading into obscurity year after year, Falls is a place that houses an array of  rich characters, from the employees at the diner, to Miles' ex wife, to the wealthy matriarch who seems to own the entire town. I found myself saying that cliche line, &quot;I didn't want it to end&quot; A book and place to get lost in for a little.	2004-01-07

The most unique aspect of this story is the split narrative the author uses. The bulk of the book is spent in various flats on a suburban street in London. Over the course of one day we're let into the minds of the various tenents, their hopes, their fears, and their desires, as the narrative steams like a freight train to a tragedy that we know has happened at the start of the book, but don't know what it is until the end. The other narrative is told first person by a girl who was living there when the tragic event occurs, and the action shifts focus between past and present.<br />It's interesting to read that some of the other reviewers read the book in one sitting or close to it, because that's essentially what I did as well. The book demands a certain amount of attention from the reader because the author has dispensed with names and obvious physical discriptions for characters unless it holds relevence to what's going on with them emotionally.Consequently characters are referred to as: 'The young man in room 18'. or. 'the boy in room 17', but  surprisingly this device only adds to the potency of the writing and made for me a more moving reading experience.	2003-12-30

Much of the hype surrounding this book has been more about the author than the actual story itself. For those who don't know the back story, Christopher Paolini was fifteen years old when he wrote the book. His mother edited it, and his family self published the novel before an editor at Knopf read it and bought it. Now nineteen and at work on the second of what he says will be three stories total, the book is about a young boy named Eragon whose life becomes linked to a dragon, and his destiny promises greatness.<br />As I was reading the book I kept thinking, \\"Wow! A fifteen year old penned this, that's pretty terrific.\\" However I guess that's more a statement of the story teller than the story itself. Paolini is a gifted writer. Clearly there's a wonderful imagination at work and I'm sure he'll have a long career ahead of him. Admittedly he says he grew up reading lots of fantasy books, and they all seem to be here in some form. For a younger reader who is looking for something beyond Hogwarts this will be great. He creates a detailed and textured world that you can lose yourself in including a pronounciation guide and a language dictionary of words used in the book. For readers very familiar with the fantasy terrain this will all seem like rehashed-well Tolkien to begin with. As well as Robert Jordan and Anne McCaffrey. Yet even with the obvious comparisons, I found the book entertaining and well written. I actually thought he managed to move through the story with much less excess than any of Robert Jordans recent books. So if you're not concerned with something not being 100 percent original, you might enjoy this book. I did.	2003-12-28

Unlike many American detective novels where the protagonist is tough and hard boiled, Montalbano is refined, and cultured. He is known in the community to be fair minded and kind with a love of fine food and finer women.<br />When a important official in town is found dead in a seedy area Montalbano investigates with his own style and charm.<br />The book, the first of four, has been translated from Italian, and the books are bestsellers in Europe. While enjoyable, it was an adjustment from what I'm usually used to reading in regards to mystery novels. Much of the book deals with life in an Italian town and the heiarchy that exists there, as well as the political climate. A glossary in the back provides translations from everything to local police customs to money exchanges. While giving you a definite feel of time and place, it didn't always engage me like I hoped it would. Still, it's an enjoyable and quick read if you're looking for a mystery series that's different in tone and locale.	2003-12-15

His novel &quot;Wicked&quot; has been adapted into a Broadway musical, and has opened to mostly positive reviews, and his new novel reminds people what he was so good at in the first place. His last book, &quot;Lost&quot; a modern ghost story seemed to be written by a competely different person from the man who reinvented both &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;. He has now returned to his fairy tale roots and concocted his own spin on the Snow White story. Blending the factual Italian Borgia family with a land owner named Don Vincente and his beautiful young daughter named Bianca, Maguire manages to tread very closely to the story many people are familiar with. The one area he diverges from is the dwarves. Gone are Bashful, Sleepy and Doc, and instead are creatures more of the earth than human.I also thought his &quot;apple&quot; was both inventive and clever. A well told retelling.	2003-12-01

King mostly departs from his usual blend of modern day horror and gore and instead weaves a wonderfully heartfelt and captivating Western infused love story. Here we're introduced to a much younger and untainted Roland, as well as pals Cuthbert and Alain. But it's the fair haired beauty Susan and her complicated and tragic destiny that intertwines with the Gunslinger and drives the bulk of the book. A final chapter returns us to our regular band of merry travellers with a conclusion drawn from &quot;the Wizard of Oz' which was a little disconnecting in relation to everything that had preceded it. Still, the book overall is a great ride that's not the usual King fare, and doesn't fall into the trap of waiting for something to happen while galloping towards the end of the series.	2003-11-26

The brothers, believing they were spoken to by God carried out the brutal crime with hardly a thought. It's an interesting read that moves beyond the murder and takes a greater look at what was behind it, religious fanaticism. Be it Muslim, Mormon, or Christian, Krakauer loosly touches on what makes these people tick, while specifically examining the Church of Ladder Day Saints, and it's founders.<br />I found much of the history interesting, although felt it started to get a little bogged down by his sometimes heavy handed point in reference to fanaticism. Still it's a fascinating read about a group of people living in our country that many people probably don't know anything about.	2003-09-28

Paul Iverson is a lingusitics professor whose wife dies when she falls out of a tree in their back yard. Their dog, Lorelei is the only witness to the event, and Paul believes that if he can instruct her to speak, he'll get the answer to a gnawing question: Was the fall accidental or on purpose?<br />Where the \\"Lovely Bones\\" worked for me and this didn't is in \\"Bones\\", the main character witnesses her family and friends grieve about her. Here, Paul is the one grieving and yet it's only when another party comments on his disheveled appearance or messy house we're given clues to his state of being.I suppose we're supposed to glean from his desperate attempt to get the dog to talk it's a way to cope?<br />The book shifts between past and present recounting the courtship and marriage leading up to the event in the tree with his wife bobbing between fits of impulsive happiness to hair pulling, table clearing tantrums.This guy didn't think she might have a problem? This is balanced with Paul attempting to teach the dog the English language, and a quickly resolved subplot of a sadistic fringe group that practices horrible experiments on canines in an attempt to get them to speak.<br />I missed it. The only thing or creature I should say I felt anything for was the dog, but animals in peril, like children are easy button pushers for me. It's clear Parkhurst has a vivid imagination, and is technically a gifted writer, but the only message I got from the book was to hug your dog today.	2003-07-26

Kathy Nicolo is a recovering addict who loses her home when the county repossesses it for back taxes.<br />Colonel Bahrani was once a Captain in the Iranian Army before the fall of the Shah. He escapes to this country, and is now attempting to take part in the American dream by puchasing her forfeited home. What begins as a misunderstanding escalates into a tragic turn of events. The runaway motion of the narrative reminded me of the book 'A Simple Plan' and also 'In The Bedroom'. Ironically, 'In The Bedroom' was based on a short story called 'Killings', penned by this author's father. Andre Dubus also wrote the screenplay for the movie adaption of '...Sand and Fog' which stars Jennifer Connolly as Kathy, and Ben Kingsley as the Colonel.	2003-07-22

It's great! What so many people have said is how much the story of Seabiscuit, Red Pollard (the jockey), Tom Smith (the trainer) and Charles Howard (the owner)reads like a work of fiction. Laura Hillenbrand has a wonderful knack for making you really care about these people, and fall in love with the horse. The book is also so accessible for people not familiar with the sporting event because it doesn't get weighed down with overly detailed facts about racing. It simply presents what you need to know in order to move the narrative along. It should make a fantastic movie.	2003-07-16

Gone is the naive and sweet Harry Potter, and instead we get a petulant, moody, and generally sullen teenager not terribly happy with the way things are turning out.<br />Some people may find this a turn off, I found it real and refreshing. JK Rowling also manages to shake up the formulaic narrative of the previous books, and presents a much longer opening before Harry's eventual arrival at Hogwarts. But many things familiar are not there at the outset. Hagrid for one doesn't turn up until almost halfway through the book. My only letdown, and it's minimal, is that the climax of the novel didn't live up to the pages preceding it. Overall though, once again Rowling manages to find new and creative avenues to explore, especially the detailed Ministry of Magic.	2003-07-07

And all of it is done with his wicked sense of humor that cuts right to the bone. Anyone who saw and liked \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" or watched his acceptance speech on the Academy Awards will already be familiar with his irreverent attitude.  The book is chock full of facts and figures of the calamities our leaders have been commiting without many of us knowing anything about it. Several chapters had me laughing out loud including, 'The End of Men' and 'The People's Prayer', which is a heavenly plea to smite our leaders with poverty, gay sons and daughters,handicapped children and rotting teeth without dental coverage.	2003-06-21

Instead he serves his purpose almost as a Greek chorus, presenting the facts and being close enough to the epicenter of the storm to folow the tragic events closely.<br />I read almost the whole book in one sitting, and it has lingered with me long after I've finished it.

Yes it's filled with graphic and sometimes foul discriptions of sex acts and bodliy functions, but the book's about a prostitute in the 19th century! People expecting to go through the nearly 850 page book and not be faced with the stark ugly realities of Sugar's world should probably break open their Harlequin romances.<br />I thought it a testament to the author that at it's length it continued to remain compelling throughout, with no real clues as to where the characters were headed. I also appreciated his tongue in cheek approach to the material that had me laughing out loud at the follies these characters underwent.<br />Is it pretty? Absolutely not.

Now retired, Harry is haunted by an unsolved case and the female victim who has been forgotten over time. His casual investigating causes a stir in both the LAPD and the FBI, and soon Harry seems over his head in something greater than he anticipated.<br />Connelly uses the Los Angeles terrain almost as a character itself, with Bosch stopping at many of the city's famous landmarks throughout his investigation. The action moves quickly and builds to a great suspenseful climax, yet also manages to  bring about another level of depth and humanity to this wonderful character at the books end. A must read for Harry Bosch fans.	2003-05-23

The story is of a Harvard symbologist who aids a French cryptologist in uncovering clues her murdered Grandfather has left behind in the works of Leonardo DaVinci.<br />Plot supersedes character development, which seems to work in the first half of the book, but as I got closer towards the end it felt like stock cardboard cut outs delivering rather stilted dialogue.

Glassner is featured in the Michael Moore documentary, \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" and what he had to say in the film prompted me to buy the book. Although some chapters were definitely more interesting than others, overall the book is a wonderful educational tool in learning not to take everything we're spoon fed by politicians and the media at face value.

Dennis Lehane has given another flawless example of why he's at the head of the pack of mystery writers. Set in 1954, two federal marshalls are sent out to Shutter Island which is the home of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. A patient by the name of Rachel Solando has escaped and she's considered very dangerous. No sooner do they arrive than a fierce storm ravages the island, stripping it of power and stranding the detectives. What follows is a page a minute jaw dropper as one mystery unravels into another. Ultimately the less you know the better. All I can say is it plays out brilliantly with a guaranteed shock ending you won't see coming. Halfway through I kept saying to myself, 'this would be such a great movie', and then I read the rights have already been snapped up. What I marvel at is how unlike everything else he's already written this is. This feels almost Ira Levinish, or more recently something M. Night Shyamalan would have penned. It's the book that everyone will be talking about, and hopefully not revealing too much.	2003-04-24

Similar in style to Michael Cunningham's \\"The Hours\\", the book is broken into three stories that interweve along a family bloodline. Each story melds between the present and the past, with the last story bookending the first in a clever way. My problem with the book is I found the first and last sections far too short and the middle section too long. It also reminded me of \\"The Hours\\" for it's themes of life and death, I just felt \\"The Hours\\" did it much more sucessfully.	2003-04-10

A suporting cast of gays and straights who chide said protagonist for being such a child.<br />Drugs, drugs, and more drugs.<br />Oh and lots and lots of sex, and a growing desire to be a father amidst all this?!<br />So much of the book is told in a near stream of consciousness that at times is, well grating. I felt like I was reading someone's melodramatic and not very interesting journal entries. By the end I wanted to slap Tommy across the face and tell him to grow up.

I was expecting a laugh riot yarn about a working mother trying to juggle her career and family, not a book that actually strikes quite an emotional chord and presents a heroine that's not always likable, but quite honest in her portrayal.<BR>Kate Reddy is an English woman who works as a hedge fund manager. She's very successful at her job, so much so she hardly gets any time with her two young children and husband. Her witty voice brings to mind Bridget Jones, and her situations, \\"The Nanny Diaries\\". At first I wasn't sure I was really going to like the novel because I found myself reacting to her in a negative light. But as the novel progressed, I found myself having a greater understanding and empathy for the character. Allison Pearson has written an entertaining story that should also provoke some interesting discussions about not just working mothers, but working parents in general.	2003-03-29

Once again Robert Crais has managed to produce another page turning thriller with the characters he started with, Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. What's so great about Crais is he manages to churn out nail biting suspense while at the same time revealing more of the personalities and personal demons of his characters. For those who have never read him before, you could read this as a stand alone, but the experience is much deeper if you've read all the previous Cole novels. In this one, Lucy Chenier's son Ben is kidnapped by a man who is bent on revenge for something Cole had done in his past. Elvis with the help of a worn and recovering Joe Pike hunts him down. Fast paced with plenty of twists, my only fault with the book, is that it was over too soon.	2003-03-02

That said this was a laborious exercise in excess. I want to read these Wheel of Time books for Rand, Elayne, Matt, Perrin, Egwene &amp; Nyaneve. I'm so tired of pages devoted to characters like Galina, Ethenielle, &amp; Riselle (What's with the names ending in elle?) I found myself skimming in haze of confusion and by the time I had pushed through to the end I couldn't tell you who those incidental characters were, nor did I care. I'm beginning to wonder if Jordan really has an end in sight. It seems his motto is bigger is better. But frankly, I'd rather have a book half the size that involves the core story than an additional two hundred and fifty pages of people and places that require an extensive glossary to keep up with. The 10th book is out now, but I need a break. My suggestion is read this fairly soon after the 8th book so you at lest know who some of the smaller characters are. And read it as fast as you can.

Whatever is was, she's created an interesting and engaging case, while introducing two new detectives who seem to serve up comic relief more than anything else.

Falling under the category of truth is stranger than fiction, Augusten Burroughs is lucky to have any sense of humor at all in regards to his past. A near psychotic Mother, a non existant emotionally detached Father, and a Doctor that gives a hideous name to psychiatry, are just a fraction of his distorted reality. I wanted to love it and again only didn't because I found myself so depressed at the circumstances. From reading some other reviews, I guess many people have compared him to David Sedaris, and that seems inevitable given they both had some wacky incidents in their lives.

I bought it because I had read that this particular book read much more like the old Anne Rice and not like the drivel she's been churning out the last few years. It started promising, when a young Vampire, Quinn Blackwood seeks out Lestat for assistance in getting rid of an evil doppelganger named Goblin.Quinn begins to recount his history, and suddenly Anne Rice turns into a bodice ripping Harlequin romance novel complete with people falling hopelessly in love at first glance and fifteen year old girls quoting Shakespeare, and being tragically ill. Ugh. All of a sudden Quinn  becomes annoying and frankly ridiculous,falling in lust and love with every manner of man, woman, and ghost. Lestat and Rowan Mayfair  meanwhile are wasted cameo players in a melodramatic mess of southern low class complete with a drunken country singer mother, and a sexy African American maid. The book slightly redeemed itself in the last fifty pages or so once it was back to the present, and it's clear Rice is  setting this story up for a whole new group of blood drinkers. I just wish it would've stayed with the vampires, and been less Gothic romance.	2002-12-23

This fantastic adventure story is a testament to the triumph of the human spirit, a fascinating study of the way we relate to animals both behind and in front of bars,as well as a raw example of the human instict for survival.

This is the first in a planned four part series that that follows a young girl named Candy Quackenbush as she stumbles into another world, and soon learns how she is the center of this bizarre, detailed, and richly imagined universe.Filled with characters that could only be spawned from the mind of horror master Clive Barker he weaves a suspensful and magical tale that by the end is nothing more than a delicious prologue before the feast.It should also be mentioned that the book is printed on high gloss paper because it's filled with gorgeous and sometimes haunting watercolors that illustrate the tale. For adult fans of Harry Potter who haven't found anything to compare, this could be the answer. It also reminded me of a \\"Wizard of Oz\\" for the new millenium. I loved every creative imaginative second of it	2002-11-02

Packed with colorful people he's worked with over the years at times you'll feel like you're reading about characters from the HBO prison drama &quot;Oz&quot;, and not sous chefs and bread makers for some of New Yorks finest eateries. Bourdain seems as comfortable with the pen as the knife, and his stories are funny,insightful, and sometimes downright shocking. Tips on what days not to eat fish, and why brunches are never a good thing round out a particularly great chapter, as well as his recounting of a &quot;day in the life&quot;. For people who've never worked in a restuarant this may be eye opening, to those who have they'll be nodding their smiling heads in agreement with how much they relate to.	2002-10-29

A fictionalized retelling of Grace Marks, a Canadian woman who was convicted of murder at the age of sixteen, I liked this even more than \\"Assassin\\", and found it hard to put down. Told mostly from Grace's point of view she recounts her childhood and employment leading up to the brutal double murders that many people think she did not commit, but was merely an unwilling accomplice. But the other element to Atwood's narrative is the doctor that is examining her to acertain what really happened that night. His story is equally compelling as Grace's. A rich, captivating read.	2002-10-19
US	52978794	R3UUS14KWB97ZZ	0786808772	163865641	Summerland	Books	3	20	23	N	Y	Moments	I loved Chabon's \\"Kavalier & Clay\\" and was really excited when I read he was writing a book for young adults. I felt really mixed aboutt he result. First off, I think it's unfair to make the immediate comparison to the young wizard at Hogwarts. Those books are just in a different and unstoppable class of their own. That said I think Chabon's fantasy of a boy named Ethan Feld who has to save the world through baseball has moments of charm and imagination. The alternative world that Ethan travels to is inhabited by all kinds of mythical creatures such as werewolves, giants, and even a Sasquatch. But for me I didn't find the story all that compelling. Yes,there's a villan who's more or less the devil, but we barely see him or his nasty deeds so he never is quite as ominous as he should be. Plus there's never a real concern that Ethan and his friends won't complete their various tasks, and at the end of the day everything will be fine.On another note, since the book relys so much on the playing of baseball, if you're not a fan you may find that element a turn off. It's a fine young adult book. But beyond Potter I'd try Phillip Pullman's world for a richer and deeply imagined world.	2002-10-09

Two in particular are just plain brilliant: The first about a woman who's a shape shifter, and the second an imagined account of life for the former First Lady Nancy Reagan as she copes with her husbands alzheimer condition.

After coming this far in the series and investing in literally thousands of pages I found it so annoying to once again slog through scads of exposition with characters you won't remember or see again fifty pages down the line. I love this series. I wouldn't of come this far if I didn't. But this was the first in eight books that I had to put down a few times just because it was a chore. Yes, it does gain momentum three quarters of the way through, but getting there was hard. If you've read everything previous to this, no review is going to stop you. Just be prepared for a lot of dull ,and a little adventure.	2002-10-01

It was until my work partner badgered me enough that I relented and read it. Wow was I glad I did. This is a beautiful, haunting first novel with a collection of unforgettable characters who represent such different worlds.At the center of them like the sun is Astrid, a young girl whose brilliant and artistic mother murders her lover sending her to jail, and Astrid into a string of foster homes.The book succeeds because although there are some horrible things that happen to Astrid the character never wallows in self pity. She just keeps moving forward, and we with it like witnessing an accident site you can't turn away from. Michelle Pfeiffer should be near perfection as Astrid's mother in the feature, and Alison Lohman who plays the title role is already receiving outstanding reviews. If you liked Wally Lamb's books you'd probably enjoy this as well.	2002-09-21

At the heart of the story are two central figures, Roxanne Coss, the beautiful American lyric soprano, and Mr Hosokawa, a Japanese businessman who has come to hear her sing. What starts out as what would seem a fast negotiation winds out into months, and soon the captors and their captives find themselves creating a whole new world beyond the locked doors of the home they're in.Quite artfully Patchett weaves her story much like the operas Roxanne sings,chock full of romance and ultmately tragedy. I found myself straining a slight bit with the credibility of the situation, but enjoyed the various characters so much that overall found it to be a very good read.	2002-09-17

Once again reading Peter Mayle is the next best thing to actually being there. Most of the book covers brand new territory in the South of France including the perfect corkscrew, an olfactory lesson, and the joys of olive oil, while also revisiting many of his favorite topics including the wonder of truffles and of course the wine and food.In fact my only slight beef with the book is his need to revisit some topics already covered in previous books, but it's so slight it hardly detracts from the overall joy the book manages to evoke.	2002-09-08

He's a vibrant and curious boy and the narrative takes us from first grade up into middle school. I liked this book, and appreciated it's message, but didn't enjoy it as much as \\"Stargirl\\". This book has a removed third person narrative,like someone's reporting key moments of the boy's life, and it left me not as emotional invested as \\"Stargirl\\" did. Still, it's a decent book with it's heart in the right place, and a character probably many people can relate to and hopefully learn from.	2002-09-01

Hollywood insiders have always been smitten with movies and television shows about the downright mean business they work in. So it would be no surprise to me if many of those same people found this book a delightfully literary black comedy. Dori carter writes well, with the voice of her narrator, Frankie Jordan almost feeling like someone Sue Grafton or Susan Isaacs would have created.Unfortunately she's not someone I ever rooted for in the book. In fact I don't think there were any people in this book I even liked let alone rooted for.-Well, maybe her Grandmother who is not integral to the plot but at least had a heart. Overall the book left me confused;Was it a cautionary tale of the pitfalls in Hollywood or a meditation on how Jews perceive themselves versus the idealized world of the WASP they're perpetuating in the media? Maybe both, or neither one. Ultimately the only thing I learned was that Hollywood is full of hateful, unhappy people.	2002-08-30

The story is of three very different Americans staying in the same guest house run by a 400 pound former American.

The X's are an amalgam of many of the varied experiences the two authors had in their many years of nannydom.<br />2)And I found it to be very sad. Yes Nan's observations at times can prompt a hearty chuckle, but the situation for me becomes so desparate I wanted her to kill Mrs X and abscond to Brooklyn with the poor child.<br />The book is being adapted for a feature by \\"Sex & the City\\" alumnus Jenny Bicks, who seems like the exact choice to capture the tenor of Nan's voice for the big screen. However I can't help but wonder, without giving anything away, if the ending may not be altered to leave the audience more satisfied. I for one would recommend it.	2002-08-25

Darwin Minor is an accident investigator for insurance companies. One of the best in the business actually. But as he begins to uncover what may be massive insurance fraud,it seems someone definitely wants him dead.At times the book almost feels like something John Grisham would've penned. And the accidents are all based on real incidents, which unfortuantely are very funny at the expense of some very stupid people. There are points the book could use an editor,especially in regards to the meticulous detailing of firearms, but overall it's a mindless page turner for people with a penchant for Grisham or Patterson.	2002-08-21

Some character stories get mini resolutions such as Elayne's &amp; Aviendha's search for the weather bowl, but most only open doors to new and more complex issues. I actually enjoyed this installment more than the last, my only issue with the book was a hasty and neat ending that I'm not sure if I believe is true. Of course you can never be sure of anything in Jordan's world, but here I just felt it wrapped up a little too neatly in the end.	2002-08-17

Why and editor didn't shake off some of the excess to get to the heart of the story is beyond me, but as it is I had a hard time staying interested after the first three hundred and fifty pages or so. The other problem I had with the book is I didn't find Carter's protagonist particularly likable.So for me I had a hard time connecting with the guy much less investing in his dilemma. Consequently by the time the novel climaxed in a cinematic stand off, there was little surprise or interest. Streamlined this could've been a taut page turning thriller. There were just too many pages to turn to get to the thrill.	2002-08-04

Her conception of the afterlife as seen through the eyes of a murdered fourteen year old is unique and original and will have you seeking out people who've read the book so you can talk about it.I found the book hard to put down once I started, and a little awed by the flood of emotions it managed to stir up. I've tried hard to stay away from reading many of the reviews until I was finished because I didn't want to know too much. Hard to classify: Ghost story? Suspenseful mystery? Painful and honest family portryal? It seems to capture so many different facets in an honest and affirming way I don't think you can help but be affected.

For then so many people would miss out on what is a haunting and beautifully told story. Set in Dublin between 1915 and 1916 the focus of the book is on two boys, Jim and Doyler. Their fathers were long ago army buddies but that relationship has fallen by the wayside. Doyler is the rough and tumble working class, while Jim the sensitive student, whose brother is off fighting in the war.<br />But that is only the beginning. The book in it's own unique way gets in the heads of these characters with dialogue and cadence creating it's own demanding rhythm. The best is to relax into the book and trust the story will reveal itself, because it can be a little tough going in the beginning. However if you're patient you'll find  beyond the simple love story of two boys, a near epic telling of class, of war, and political history. I was captivated right up to the last heartbreaking page.	2002-07-10

Rand begins to pull together a group of men who can channel, while big changes are in store for Egwene, Nyaneve, and Elayne. Some new characters are introduced including a false dragon named Taim who looks like he'll be around for a while, and a welcome addition back to the fold is Perrin and his wife Faile. My only beef with the book is Jordan's need for an editor. After reading again and again about how low or high a bodice is cut, and the inner details of city after city it begins to get tedious by page seven hundred.<br />I also didn't think this book really took off until about half way through with scads of exposition to wade through. Still, you have to marvel at a man who can write the volume he does with no apparent end in sight and still manage to keep his characters mostly compelling.	2002-07-04

Michael Adams has managed to balance his jingle writing career and his wife and two very young kids in a rather unique way; He leads two lives. In one, he's a devoted father put upon by his demands at work which force him to be away from home for a few days at a time.Away from home he shares a flat with three distinct bachelors who have no idea he's married, let alone has kids.<br />All this plays out in a witty, funny first person narrative that sounds like a role tailor made for Hugh Grant, Colin Firth or Greg Wise.If you liked Nick Hornby's &quot;About A Boy&quot;, or Tony Parsons &quot;Man &amp; Boy&quot; you'd probably enjoy this as well.	2002-06-16

If you haven't read &quot;A Year In Provence&quot;, I'd suggest starting with that as many of the &quot;characters&quot; he introduced make return visits here. Less structural than his first book, these chapters come off as varied meditations on random events that occur day to day; A birthday picnic, a new found pet,the search for gold in his backyard, and of course the various gastromical pleasures to be found throughout the region. I didn't find it quite as good as the first book, but still he has a way of making you feel like you're sitting down with an old friend.	2002-06-13

It involves a Manhattan reference librarian who is hired by a wealthy, old, eccentric man who needs help tracking down a watch believed to have been owned by Marie Antoinette. A beach read for the literary set, the book is filled with puns, and clever word play all intentionally formatted to span exactly 360 pages, and resolve the conflict in sixty minute like chapters. The book to it's credit reads very fast, but about half way through I started to not really care about what was happening, and worse after some revelations late in the story, felt let down. I don't know what exactly I was expecting or what kind of pay off, but aside from being clever and well written, it's not something I'd recommend to many people.	2002-06-07

Our narrator, Reuben Land is both a witness to miracles, and the recipiant of one at the hand of his father. His life in 1960s North Dakota takes a dramatic turn when his brother kills two men who break into their house. The novel is sweet, and well written and liable not to offend anyone. At times it feels like part Bible story, and part old fashioned Western which figures prominantly as a theme for Rueben's sister.Somehow when I started the book I think I was expecting more of a payoff, which for me never really came. Still it's a pleasant and charming first novel.	2002-06-04

His \\"Man & Boy\\" was one of my favorite books last year, and this may end up being one of this years. I think he's great because he creates real, honest, and flawed protagonists. They don't have all the answers and more often than not will probably do something that produces hideous results, but their reality makes me root for them all the more. In his newest book, it's Alfie Budd, a teacher at a language school who is slowly moving through the unbearable grief caused by the tragic death of his wife. Like \\"Man & Boy\\" Parsons revisits themes of love and loss, & children's relationships to their parents.Equally moving and very funny, the book unravels with not a great amount of surprise, but a boudless supply of heart.	2002-05-29

A must for anyone visiting the south of France, he humorously recounts his first year after purchasing a farm house in one of the more remote sections of the countryside. Less about the day to day construction, and more the characters that inhabit the region, he also describes the rich and tasteful foods, as well as change of seasons.

Simple, and satisfying it is a charming and wonderful escapist read. One that when you finish, will make you want to brush up on your French, and book the next flight out.	2002-05-12

I love the Unfortunate Event books but found this to be a mixed bag. Laugh out loud funny at points, the book is less a biography of Snicket, and more a random dropping of clues and shaded revelations about the mysteries of V.F.D., Count Olaf and his associates, and of course the poor Baudelaire orphans.Also, the book seemed a little more complex than any of the series books, and it says right in the beginning you don't need to read it in any particular order. One of the more clever aspects is the satirizing of the Unfortunate Events books by having a replicated book cover on the back of the dust jacket. This series artwork, done to look just like the \\"Unfortunate\\" series is called, \\"the Luckiest Kids In The World\\". Clever, but I can't wait until #9 comes out.	2002-05-11

The story is so rich and epic in it's mere 350 pages, I wanted it to just keep going. I knew nothing about the plot before I started and I think the less you know the better.McEwan has created a wonderful collection of characters whose actions will shock and provoke as you witness their folley. Brilliant as well is his descriptive prowess of not just the English countryside, but of the horrors of war.This is the best book I've read so far this year.	2002-05-09

I love this character, and found the most interesting aspect of this particular book how the case affected him. However I didn't find it to be the taut, tension driven narrative that I think is so prevalent in his first five books. To me nothing since has topped them for their sheer heart pounding plots. Still it's definitely worth reading especially if you're a fan of Harry.	2002-04-30

Instead, falling under the \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\" heading she centers her book on an unlikely and unexpected friendship that manages to shake her world more than she could ever anticipate.<br />Orginally she meets Stacie and Barb through an adoption agency she works with. Stacie is a fourteen year old girl who is pregnant from rape. Barb is her concerned mother.What transpires between the three of them is the story. Interspersed are moving reflections on her own Mother, Father, and children as she tries to grapple with what is real,what is false, what is safe, and most importantly, what is love... \\"Find Me\\" is not what you'd expect to find. That in itself is a wonderful discovery.	2002-04-24

His descriptive prose has a tendency to run on and on, especially in regards to clothing!But aside from that, now re-reading this series for a second time I find it even more enjoyable. Small victories are won as the story moves closer to Rand's ultimate battle with The Dark One. One of the best things about this particular installment is that the character of Matt who in the previous novels I just found plain annoying, is finally becoming a more well rounded and interesting character with some real purpose. The downside to the book is Perrin is not mentioned once. Fans who've enjoyed the series thus far will find more of the same, but with some new twists. And not everyone makes it through this time.Personally I find myself breaking the novels up instead of reading them one right after the other. That way I find you don't get burned out too quickly.	2002-04-23

Told from the point of view of a overweight thirteen year old Ozark boy who with his flirtatious Mother and mean spirited and violent Father barely stay afloat in the muck of poverty.A short small book at under two hundred pages it races like a freight train towards a tragic and unforgettable conclusion than resonates even stronger because of the choice of his narrator.Woodrell offers no easy answers or solutions, but instead paints a sometimes hilarious, but more often upsetting depiction of desperate lives pushed to severe and drastic measures. Lives that by the end of the novel, converge like a modern day spin on a classic Shakespearean or Greek tragedy.	2002-04-09

It was only after I had started it I learned the author is the editor for British vanity Fair. That being said it is for the most part an enjoyable espionage thriller. When Robert Harland's U.N. plane crashes in the waters right beside LaGuardia airport he is the sole survivor. Rescued by a bizarre technological stroke of luck, he has only just returned home, when a man show up on his doorstep claiming to be his son; The result of an affair he'd had years before with a Czech woman when he was a spy for the British. What this man has to tell him combined with the crash which Harland believes may have been sabotage,begins to unravel an unsettling and intricately plotted novel that moves from Manhattan to the streets of London, to the war torn fields of Bosnia. I thought Henry Porter created some wonderfully drawn characters, mainly Harland's caring sister, and the brilliant Tomas. I think plot wise I was just expecting a non stop fast paced thriller and instead this is a much more complex political chess game with bursts of action. But if you're a fan of authors like Robert Ludlam you'd probably really enjoy this.	2002-04-08

Will it change the world and be a literary classic? Probably not, but it's twisted and perverse and sinister fun. Imagine if you will, \\"The Real World\\", or \\"Felicity\\" on a bad acid trip. If either of these shows are a foreign concept, this book may not be for you. The dark and disturbing things going on at the author's Atherton college reminded me of Donna Tartt's, \\"the Secret History\\", but with an MTV bent. Two bright college students, a gay man, Randall, and gal pal Kathryn each have their own dark secrets they keep from the other. As the story progresses it's what they don't tell that could ultimately harm them and the people they come in contact with. Chock full of twists and surprises, it's a book that will keep you guessing up until the gruesome and gothic finale that could only come from the mind of a Rice. Editing snafus aside I found this book to be even more assured and well written than his first, and if you liked \\"Density of Souls\\", you'll probably like this as well.	2002-03-31

As a child it terrified me,the prophecies foretold in the Bible. Reading this trilogy brought it all back to me. BeauSeigneur's narrative which flows so seamlessly from one book to the next, reads like vintage Stephen King or Tom Clancy with his spiritual message coming through in the third book with a deft touch and poweful resonance. The final chapter in the ultimate battle for man's soul is continued to be seen through Decker Hawthorne's eyes,an every man questioning everything he knows when faced with a horrible dilemma: Could the boy he raised and help propel his career actually be the Antichrist?<br />This book had me questioning the strength of my own beliefs, and how firm they are. The realism with which the author describes the horrible last days is enough to make anyone make the right choice so they too won't be left behind.	2002-03-25

Nursed back to health by a drunken doctor bits of his past slowly begin to come back to him, and with it the danger of his true identity. An identity that many would kill him for.<br />Detailed and intricate the plot is fast paced and action packed. The only down side to it, is it's near cliff hanger ending that pretty much expects you'll have the next chapter of the trilogy ready to go.	2002-03-18

It's described as a psychological thriller about a psychiatrist who saves a man from drowning. The catch is the man he saves was once a client of his who he inadvertently helped send away to a correctional institute because of damaging testimony.<br />Sounds good right? I missed it. I didn't find the book tense at all. Every time it started to work towards something I thought was going to be remotely suspenseful, it petered out. I was really disappointed. In fact about the highest praise I can give it is that at just over two hundred pages it reads like a halfway decent short story. A not terribly exciting short story, but a short story never the less.	2002-03-01
US	52978794	RN9FFXV4F2NJT	0965694836	391817798	Birth of an Age (Book Two of the Christ Clone Trilogy, 2nd Edition)	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Terrifying Apocalyptic Tale	Picking up where \\"In His Image\\" left off, James BeauSeigneur wastes no time getting into the heart of the destruction of the Apocalypse.After a brief prologue where he recounts the end of the first book, the story becomes a heart thumping page turner as the prophecies in the book of Revelations are unleashed upon the earth with terrifying and deadly results.<br />The reason this series works so well to me is that BeauSeigneur has virtually taken the books from the point of view of the antichrist, charming the reader early by him before you're aware of who he is. By presenting it from his side and hearing first hand his logic makes it easier to see how the masses would get duped by him. It ultimately makes it much scarier and insidious than the very stock evil guy, Nicolae Carpathia from the \\"Left Behind\\" books.Additionally the book works so well because it seems BeauSeigneur realizes that as the tribulation unfolds it's the events themselves that are the story, not individual people.By keeping his story centered around Christopher and Decker the focus isn't lost with ten and twelve other underdeveloped characters which is what I feel the 'Let Behind\\" series does.<br />This book had me on the edge of my seat, and nervous in a way I haven't felt in a while. Scientifically it all feels very probable which only adds to the terror. This is a 'left behind' that makes \\"Left Behind\\" look like Disney World. And if you're looking for something not nearly as well written and very dragged out you should stick with the \\"Left Behind\\" series.But for me, the \\"Christ Clone Trilogy\\" are far and away the best.	2002-02-24

Beyond the basic complexities of the plot, and the worlds he's created, Jordan's fourth installment weaves in new characters while still giving the regular cast plenty to do, especially Perrin and Rand.<br />Ending on much more of a cliff hanging note, this latest chapter of He Who Comes With The Dawn feels ultimately like great set up for the subsequent books. And if you've become as addicted to them by this point as most people have, you'll want to have the next book, &quot;The Fires of Heaven waiting on deck.	2002-02-19

Every sentence is so packed it leaves you no time to relax or barely take a breath. It is demanding and exacting and if you're looking for a light beach read this is definitely not the book. Told in flashback, the main bulk of the story is about a half Spanish half English gay man's coming of age in an English boarding school. The relationship that develops with one of his teachers begins a torturous journey into his young adult life. And although verbally plodding in some points I found it so well written I was able to excuse the sometimes involved stream of consciousness of the character.<br />The story is then book ended by our protagonist in the present day searching for love and connecting with a hustler he finds in a magazine ad. This is where the book veered off course for me. It certainly didn't end where I expected, but after building to a climax both figuratively and literally I expected more and was left feeling very dissatisfied and somewhat cheated.<br />Stylistically if you read either \\"The God In Flight\\" or Michael Arditti's \\"Pagen's Father\\" and enjoyed those you may want to give this a go.	2002-01-28

Leaving behind the fairy tales of his previous books, Maguire sets his story in present day with a very vaguely drawn protagonist named Winifred Rudge. A writer who has stumbled out of the gate with a case of writers block, she goes to England to visit her cousin and do some research on her book. The cousin however is nowhere to be found, and instead she's confronted with two frightened contractors who while renovating the cousins house believe they have come upon something supernatural behind the walls of the chimney.<br />Maybe it was supposed to be suspenseful and nail biting. I didn't get it. I think alot of the problem for me was a woman I couldn't get a handle on who was the center of the story. Was she mean, nice? It's never really clear. Later a plot point is introduced (that I won't give away), that in another novel could be great,yet here it just baffled me even more in regards to Winnie. It was a bummer to get to the end and think: Who cares? If you've never read Maguire I'd suggest not starting here. Both &quot;Wicked&quot; and &quot;...Stepsister&quot; are much more interesting reads. &quot;...Stepsister&quot; is also being made into an ABC television movie of the week with Stockard Channing.	2002-01-19

Julien Gough's story of twin girls in their first year at University in Galway has a witty sassy narrator in sister Juliet, but I kept waiting for something to happen. The book balances on the idea of the drama of everyday life, with the pursuit of love being at the forefront. The inside dust jacket likens it to a modern day Jane Austin novel, and that's not far off the mark. A modern day romance. A literate confection with a funny smart protagonist, a handsome tightly wound professor, and an insidious menace that never really feels that menacing. For me the book is well written and an enjoyable read, just not one that plot wise has a whole lot going on.	2002-01-13

For me this book stands head and shoulders over any of the Left Behind books.<br />BeauSeigneur has such a well researched book on his hands, it reads like part sci-fi, part political thriller. And it feels believable. One of the things I loved about the book is that through three quarters of it you really don't know who's good or who's bad. The Left Behind books have such cardboard stock characters there's never any surprises.It also feels very focused. The Left Behind books are on their ninth installment, and it's dragged out narrative has readers losing interest. By making his story complete is three books, BeauSeigner makes every second count, creating a taut tension filled narrative with characters you want to see what will happen to, and a Biblical prophecy brought to life in Tom Clancy/Stephen King dimensions.	2002-01-08

He wonderfully captures the time period regularly blending fact with fiction to add further realism to his story. What a great companion piece this would make to three books similar in tone: Chabon's &quot;Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot;, Elizabeth McCracken's &quot;Niagra Fall All Over Again&quot;, and Christopher Bram's &quot;The Notorious Dr August&quot;. If you were a fan of any of those books you'd almost be guaranteed an enjoyable read with this book.The story's immediately accessible as we see the origins of Charles Carter's profession, and the final &quot;Act&quot; of the book is a thrilling page turner right out of a Hollywood movie. Well structured, well plotted, well written. A solid novel through and through!	2002-01-07

What a wonderful book to end the year with. Charles Baxter has woven together separate stories of longing, regret,passion,and need all bound together by the cord of love. The characters all relate together in some way either a neighbor,a co-worker, a lover, or parent with the stories beginning with one wandering insomniac telling another about his first wife. The characters were fresh and surprising, making painfully honest discoveries and choices.I started the book on Christmas Eve and finished it early the morning after Christmas and it left me with such a wonderful feeling. The book is by no means a sentimental journey, just a collection of wonderfully wrought examinations of the darkest corners of the human heart.	2001-12-27

With any collection of non-fiction work there's always chapters that stand out more than others, but luckily the majority of his pieces inspire laugh out loud passages, especially sections of his trip to the Aspen Comedy festival.

Regardless of where we find the various characters at the start of the book, eventually they all converge with an explosive climax that will leave you wanting the next installment. Jordan is great at keeping the action moving in a near six hundred page hard back. Not an easy feat.I actually found this book even more enjoyable than the first two. Perhaps it's that I'm now familiar with the characters so their individual journeys towards unknown destinies is much more fun. If you've never read Jordan but are a fan of the Tolkien series you may enjoy these.	2001-12-11

I should just sit back and trust I'm in the hands of a master thriller writer.First off if you haven't read any Lehane and are interested in The Kenzie/Gennaro series I'd suggest starting at the begining with A Drink Before The War&quot;. All the books are capable of standing on their own, but the characters do go through some major changes along the way, and previous books are mentioned in the later ones which could give something away. In their fifth book Patrick begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding a seemingly put together and sweet woman who takes a naked dive to her death off a building. Again he employs more twists than a crazy straw creating a frenzy of tension that will have you racing towards the end.

I keep coming back expecting more than I'm ever getting, and stick with it just to see how the authors will dramatize the Apocalypse. The one thing that has moved into the forefront is that the plot has massively overshadowed any further character development.Why the authors would choose to continue to introduce new characters when they don't service the ones they already have is beyond me. Consequently I feel very little connection to any of these people, so when one of them tragically dies I feel nothing. But apparently neither do any of the other characters since they barely address it or deal with it. I've also reached the point where my suspension of disbelief has been stretched to the limit. The amount of technical wizardry that goes on in a descimated society is astounding as well as so many people that just happen to know how to pilot a plane?! It's just a disappointment that such a great idea couldn't be weightier and not feel so sophmoric and basic in their execution.	2001-11-14

One thing that can definitely be said for this book: It will make your own screwed up family seem tame by comparison. Franzen has crafted a dense sprawling novel that presents the nuclear family stripped raw and bare. Within each titled &quot;section&quot; the book has no chapters, forcing you to turn page after page to find a good place to stop before bearing witness to another funny but painful situation these characters are in. Both hilarious and heartbreaking it's hard not to find some aspect to identify with this fractured family and their relationships.The book is demanding and may not be for people who want a happy pick me up. But I also feel the characters are ultimately redeemed, and the story ends on an uplifting note.	2001-11-12

She writes with deep felt emotion and feeling, creating well rounded and fully realized characters that you care about.That being said I felt &quot;Pigs in Heaven&quot; was a bit of a disappointment. Revisiting the characters she introduced in &quot;The Bean Trees&quot;,Kingsolver weaves the story around young Turtle's American Indian heritage and her adoptive mother's paternal claims on her.One of the things I didn't enjoy was that she moves the narrative from first person to third which seems to be a device to introduce an entirely new set of sympathetic voices to add to the custody conflict. And although I can understand why the choice was made, it still made me feel somewhat removed from Taylor, the central voice of the previous novel.To me the book felt like three separate stories that were tied together instead of one solid narrative.Ultimately the story raises some interesting points about race and family, managing to be both provoking and moving if not quite as sucessfully as it's predecessor.	2001-11-04

How this comes to pass, and the events that transpire because of it, makes for a page turning train wreck you can't turn away from. Fans of Scott Smith's &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; or the Ripley stories would probably enjoy this fun quick read, that contains a few twists that take the plot away from the expected thiller contrivances.	2001-10-28

More engrossing than the first, it will demand your attention as Jordan presents new sparring political factions who all have their own agendas surrounding The Dragon Reborn. If you haven't read the first book, you have to to have an understanding of what's going on.

The seventh book of despair and woe that has developed a cult like following, finds Mr Poe at wits end as to what to do with Violet,Klaus, and Sunny. It seems no relative wants to take them in because of the great bad luck they bring with them. So he sends them off to a village of their choosing. A village because according to wisdom that Mr Poe has heard, &quot;It takes a village to raise a child&quot;. The village the children choose holds special interest to them because it's called V.F.D. The initials the Quagmire triplets had told them held great significance...<br />What follows is disaster upon disaster, told with only the wickedest humor that Lemony Snicket can employ. I'm finding the last three books or so have been even more enjoyable than the first. And the clues keep mounting up, to the secrets behind V.F.D., and the evil Count Olaf.	2001-10-17

It's all grit staring you right in the face with unflinching honesty.The fourth book in the detective series has the duo searching for a missing child. In true Lehane fashion, there are more twists than a crazy straw, and the plot gets deeper and deeper and more horrifying as the truth comes out. Luckily there's the character of Bubba to add some needed comic relief to the story. A story that's hard to put down, and harder to shake when you finish it.	2001-10-13

Out narrator Mose Sharp is a young Jewish boy growing up in Iowa who is given the dream of vaudeville by his sister Hattie. But the story really takes off when he meets the man who is to become his partner and friend for some thirty odd years, Rocky Carter.From the midwest to the Hollywood Hills, McCracken paints a set of characters so real, so realized you feel like you're reading a wonderful celebrity bio that remembers an America captured in nostalgia. The book was faintly reminiscent to me of Michael Chabon's &quot;Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; as they're both set in the same general timeline; And if you enjoyed that book, you'd probably like this as well. It also made me, in light of recent events, feel like a part of Americana was captured. And that in itself was a small comfort and joy. A great book.	2001-10-09

After just finishing it, I have to say I liked this one even more. The fun of his books is the perspective he takes, eliciting sympathy for characters that we've grown up despising. &quot;...Stepsister&quot; like &quot;Wicked&quot; plays heavily on the ideas of the destructive side of parenting, and the psycholgical effects it has on it's recipients. It's also great fun to follow the story through what you know, and how his version will get to the fairy tale result.	2001-10-04

The third and perhaps final chapter that started with &quot;The Front Runner&quot; is a well meaning but average book. Patricia Nell Warren seems to move as effortlessly into the skin of a thirteen year old boy as she did a thirty and then forty year old man. But that's what was also the disappointment to me. Taking the perspective of John Williams, Billy Sive's son, the book felt like an advanced young adult book that subtly conveyed messages of acceptance and tolerance.The strength of the novel is on the chracters we already know like Harlan, and Chino. But this isn't their story, and they're merely supporting characters in John's coming of age drama. Over all I enjoyed the book, it just didn't captivate me like the &quot;Front Runner' originally did, and people expecting that kind of story will be disappointed.	2001-09-30

The authors choose some nifty narrative devices, the coolest being the lengthy description of the town as seen through the eyes of a bird.The downside to me is, no big surprise, the book is exceedingly graphic, and alot of it involving children. Perhaps it wouldn't of bothered me if I'd read it before September 11th, but now much of it seems almost too grim. On the plus side for fans, the book nicely sets up the possibility of another sequel which ties these books to King's &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series.	2001-09-25

His non fiction stories resound with the phrase, &quot;truth is stranger than fiction.&quot; &quot;Justice&quot; is his collection of heinous crimes, the subsequent trials, and surprisingly varied outcomes. If you've never read Dunne's work in Vanity Fair, for which he's a regular contributor, you're in for a treat. His stories are much more than your average crime and punishment retelling. They are reflections of our society in all it's grandeur and gaudiness. Over dinner soirees and cocktail parties, in the Hamptons, or Lincoln Center, his is the ear that's bent with gossipy and lurid tidbits that fuel his &quot;cases&quot; with sometimes jaw dropping confessions. Almost half of the book is devoted to the O.J. debacle, and if you're not interested in rehashing that, I'd suggest reading his previous anthology &quot;Fatal Charms &amp; The Mansions of Limbo.&quot; Which brings me to why I only gave the book four stars. I felt a little cheated that the first three stories in this collection had ben previous published in another book. I understood why his daughter's story needed to be in here, but felt the other two were merely recycled filler. But besides that a fun,entertaining bit of escapism.	2001-09-18

So I decided to start from the beginning again, and work my way through one book a month for the next nine months. If you're debating on this epic, and I mean epic series don't be daunted by the number of books or the density of each volume. Bottom line, it's wonderful, complex, and imaginative storytelling in the grandest tradition of Tolkien. The central themes are nothing new. It's the same thing J.K. Rowling's done with Harry Potter: Innocent youngster begins to realize his destiny revolves around defeating a dark and insidious evil.Here the young man is Rand al'Thor and the dark one long imprisoned, is rumored to have escaped, or very near to it. Jordan's world is much more vast and involved than Tolkien's with politics playing a big part in how characters behave. The books have also proven to be very popular with woman for their strong portrayal of a number of female characters. My suggestion if you decide to enter this magical world, is to buy the informative &quot;World of Robert Jordan&quot; which explains concepts and characters in greater detail, and is a great reference tool when you find yourself in the middle of the fourth or fifth book wondering who someone is. Personally I find the books captivating and genuine page turners, even at over eight hundred pages in paperback. If you're a fan of Tolkien, or an adult who's been seduced by Harry Potter, you might really love these books.	2001-09-11

Lots of mysterious clues were dropped in book five including the initials V.F.D.,and the children are desperate to find out the meaning of it. But where is Count Olaf?

A bestseller in England, and vaguely reminiscent in tone of Nick Hornby, Parsons book is both very funny and deeply moving at the same time. Thirty year old Harry Silver has a great job, a beautiful wife, and a perfect son. But after a one night stand with a co-worker, he suddenly finds himself navigating the waters of single parent life.It's weird to describe a book as feeling like a movie waiting to happen,but this does. It was funny, hopeful,moving,and romantic the way &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, and &quot;Notting Hill&quot; were. If you're a fan of those movies or Nick Hornby's books, you'd probably like this.	2001-08-31

Written with rapid fire dialogue and minimal character description, Crais gets right to the heart of the action with a recovering hostage negotiator attempting to put a rather harrowing failure behind him. But soon he's reluctantly drawn back into his old role and with much more at stake than ever before. Crais is quickly becoming a master at the thriller genre, and I found this to be even more nail biting and suspenseful than his previous novel &quot;Demolition Angel.&quot; But it's definitely a plot driven piece, so don't go in expecting in depth character development. It's a fast fun read and will make a great movie, Bruce Willis having secured the rights before it was even published. Still I can't help but hope that his next book will be find him back to the Elvis Cole mysteries. They're still in my opinion his best work.	2001-08-29

Books	1	7	10	N	Y	Not For Me	When I started this book I really thought it'd be a four or five star read.  Ben Tyler's smart writing style got me hooked for the first seventy-five pages or so, despite the cheesy cover that looked like an ad for a Palm Springs clothing optional resort.  From there it was all downhill.  The story of a gay Hollywood studio publicist, Bart Cain quickly softened into a predictable raunchy sexcapade with enough smut to fill an issue of \\"Honcho.\\"  I thought the characters became one dimensional and shallow including a self-involved Latino stud named \\"Rod\\"?! I also thought the writing got lazy as the story went along.  At one point he describes a character as \\"beginning to look like Allison Janney's character in 'American Beauty'\\".  This book first came to my attention in Liz Smith's column of the L.A. Times saying how great it was. I think Tyler shows great technical prowess as a writer.  Unfortunately for me it was about as shallow as the business he's satirizing.  But if what you're looking for is a very light gay summer read with bitchy characters and lots of different descriptions of male genitalia, this could be the book for you.	2001-08-16

I knew it was a collection of short stories which is usually not my thing anyway, and the first of the eleven tales I couldn't wrap my brain around. But from there it took off like a rocket, and I loved it. At first the stories seemed random with the only common thread being Manhattan, but as the book progressed the characters all began to resurface in subsequent stories.With this technique it reminded me slightly of David Mitchell's &quot;Ghostwritten&quot;. Although this book is not nearly as dense. You don't have to be a New Yorker to appreciate the sexy and near absurdist portrait he creates with his colorful characters inhabiting  an almost fairy tale city. It also wonderfully captures the enormous isolation that prevades a place that is teeming with wall to wall people day and night. A quick read at under three hundred pages it should make a smart movie, the right having been bought by Scott Rudin.	2001-08-12

I loved both &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and &quot;About A Boy&quot;, but found alot of this book hard to even like let alone love.His narrator Katie Carr is a married doctor who's having an affair. Her husband David is a bitter syndicated columnist who undergoes a spiritual transformation which has resounding effects on Katie and her two children. The book never bored me, more just left me baffled.

Kingsolver manages to make the most simple moments full of wonder and heart felt honesty. Admittedly the book has the feel of a &quot;chick book&quot;, and alot of guys would probably be turned off by it. Yet the themes of parenting, and belonging, love and personal growth to me ultimately transcends gender, and speaks of what it is to be human.	2001-08-04

And while I didn't think it was as great as his previous two in the series, it still has moments that take your breath away. Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro are first introduced in his book, &quot;A Drink Before the War.&quot; It's so important to start there and read them in sequence. &quot;Sacred&quot; begins in an alomst comical manner for the two detectives but in true Lehane style soon turns gritty and violent. They're asked, rather forcefully to track down a billionaire's daughter who has disappeared along with the original detective who was hired to find her. It just so happens the original detective was Patrick's mentor. These books are fast paced and you'll find yourself staying up late to finish them. What a great set of characters Lehane's created.	2001-08-01

For those who like me are reading these as a primer for the upcoming movie this fall, I'd suggest starting with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. There you'll be introduced to Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who finds the ring that is the catalyst for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and also the great wizard Gandalf who figures prominently in &quot;...Fellowship.&quot; It's seems so obvious now that modern masters of the fantasy genre such as Robert Jordan got so much of their inspiration from Tolkein. The edition I read also included a map so it was easy to chart the journey of Frodo Baggins, nephew of Bilbo as he headed towards his dark destination. The story is simple, at the heart being the struggle to destroy a ring forged by a powerful evil that in the hands of it's maker would spell doom for everyone.I know some people felt it slow moving, and I don't totally disagree, but I loved it all the same. Can't wait to read the next two, and see the movie this December.	2001-07-28

She's a storyteller in the grandest sense, with intricately woven plotlines, and engaging and mysterious characters. The two central to this story are sisters, Iris and Laura Chase. The former is our narrator, and she opens the book by recounting on page one the circumstances of her sister's death. From there the book moves from the present, back to the past, and to a novel within the novel that slowly reveals its' origins as the story progresses. This is not a light read, and the multiple stories demand your attention, very much like A.S. Byatt's &quot;Possession.&quot; Yet the writing is so rich, and the story so absorbing, I found it a thoroughly rewarding read.	2001-07-22

The structure would stay the same, the victims names would just change. I was so glad then to find the fifth book expanding and bringing in new characters who look like they could be around in future books. Mr Poe packs Violet, Klaus , and Sunny off to a horrible boarding school that has ridiculous rules. Of course you wait to see when the evil Count Olaf will rear his head, but the distraction in the book comes from the addition of two children the same age as Violet and Klaus who become their friends. It gives the series new places to go and breaks the normal story outlines. It's also the longest so far but for me it read the fastest. If you've liked the other books in the series you can be sure you'll like this one as well.	2001-07-11

It was my introduction to the author who quickly established himself as my (and I'm sure many others) favorite writer. How disappointing it is to say his newest book is merely okay. It's the story of Patrick Wallingford, a hunky televison journalist who, while covering an assignment, has his hand bitten off by a lion. The world watches in horror, and it starts off a chain of events involving his surgeon, and a woman who wants her husband to donate his hand to the newscaster, even though the husband is nowhere near dying. Irving has been called a modern Dickens because of his wonderfully colorful and complex characters. They weren't here for me. I liked Patrick butI didn't really care about him, and his Doctor's story which was such a part of the first hundred or so pages, disappeared in the last half of the book.Ultimately it redeemed itself by the end, but I wasn't racing to get there either. At just over three hundred pages it's also one of the shortest book he's written since &quot;Setting Free The Bears&quot; and &quot;The Water Method Man.&quot; If you're a fan, I'm sure you'll want to read it regardless, and considering the source, it's hardly a bad novel. However if you've never read Irving before, I'd suggest starting with either &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;, or &quot;A Prayer For Owen Meany.&quot; There you can see his true genius as a writer.	2001-07-09

It begins with her birth and follows her life until her fateful encounter with the little girl from Kansas.Maguire instigates an entire discussion on the nature of evil with this book. The Wicked Witch, or Elphaba as she is known comes off as a heroine through alot of the book, and some of the other classic and cherished characters such as Glinda come off as merely a petulant spoiled brat. Part of the fun of the novel is how these characters beyond Dorothy's world interact, and how the land of Oz is designed with as much if not more political turmoil than what we know in our world. Richly imagined, I found the book fascinating although I did think it dragged a bit towards the end.	2001-07-05

I felt the first two thirds of the book was great; Suspenseful, and yet successful at only giving you so much information, you wanted to keep reading. Then the plot takes a pretty significant turn, and the action slowed up a bit for me, giving way to an almost sentimental section. Two things came to mind when I read this which may be a poisitive or negative for some. One, it would make a terrific movie, and secondly it seems such an obvious choice of an &quot;Oprah&quot; book given the type of material that attracts her. At less than 300 hundred pages it's a quick an entertaining read, and much more solid than a lot a lot of the pulp out there.	2001-06-28

The novel's structure follows the character of &quot;Sandra&quot; through one year of her life as she struggles with writers block, perilously careens towards 36, and lives in of all places-horrors!-Van Nuys California. All of this is done with her bone dry humor in rare form, especially in the earlier half of the novel when she's expounding on the Zone diet, and Bally's Total Fitness. I loved the first two thirds, then felt it petered out a little by the end. Living in Los Angeles I found alot of the book really funny, although I don't know how people outside the city would relate. However most people in their mid thirties will find her characters plight at &quot;what am I doing with my life&quot; syndrome very real, funny, and a little bit scary. If you're a fan of David Sedaris, N.P.R., or just like to feel like you're hip and in the know, you'd probably enjoy this.	2001-06-26

The book picks up right where the &quot;Front Runner&quot; left off, with Billy Sive being murdered at the Olympic Games, and it's aftermath.I was glad I had re-read &quot;...Runner&quot; before I started this because it helped keep the characters fresh in my mind. Nell Warren succeeds in keeping Harlan's voice a barometer of the changing times as the seventies gives way to the somewhat more tolerant 80s.The backbone of the book is really a mystery novel with an apparent accomplice in Billy's murder still loose and aiming at Harlan. I thought for the most part this was successful although the identity of the mystery person began to be telegraphed towards the end which took some suspense out of it.My only other slight disappointment with the book was the leaping of years towards the end to bring the story closer to the present. Knowing this book may be part of a total of four books, I almost wish she'd taken more time and detailed the years that are lost by being summarized on a few pages. Still I was glad to be back in Harlan's head for a while. It felt like talking with an old friend.	2001-06-23

This is the first time I can say I was disappointed in a Kinsey Millhone book. Sure they're all kinda light, but they're always fun and manage to hook you early on with enough suspense to keep you turning pages. Here I was just left bored. Her main case took a back seat to her secondary story line which I thought became trivial and left neatly tied up with Kinsey not even seeming to deal with what happens. Did I miss something here? And the resolution to the first case slips right on in at the end which offers a murderer, but just a hint at the reason. Believe me, I get it, but it just all seemed too pat. Additionally, there's no wrap up at the end which at least brings the case to a final resolution. I hope &quot;Q&quot; is for quality plot lines.	2001-06-17

Maybe because I had such high expectations after the first three. Maybe I just loved the characters they went to live with in the second and third books. Maybe I was tired, I don't know.This is still fun, and charming, and clever. And it's always fun to see when and as what Count Olaf is going to show up, but it just left me a little colder than the others. But I am looking forward to starting book five.	2001-06-12

Patrick and Angie find themselves face to face with a serial killer loose in Boston. I was so tense reading this that at one point the phone ringing almost had me jump out of my skin. Lehane captures the simple rhythms and nuances of dialogue better than almost any writer I've read. You can't help fall in love with these characters. If you haven't read anything by him,I'd suggest starting with &quot;A Drink Before the War&quot; because it sets up the world the tough Irish Boston P.I.'s inhabit. This is not your fathers mystery novel. It's really violent, gory, and you never are sure who will make it to the end. But it's really well written, has some great plot twists, and will keep you on the edge of your seat.	2001-06-09

Hyperion has backed alot of money into it, the movie is readying to be made, and the book itself holds clues to decode a secret message on the detailed Artemis Fowl website. But it's not Harry Potter. Nowhere near, and shouldn't be judged so. It's protagonist, or more anti-hero is a conniving, self involved brilliant schemer and thief who puts plenty of lives in jeopardy before the end of the fast paced and funny book. The problem for me is once Artemis puts his nasty plan into motion,(to get a large sum of gold from a legion of fairies), the book shifts focus and becomes all about the various sprites, gnomes, and winged people that try to stop him. And don't get me wrong, they're hilarious and keep the book chugging along. The problem is, and maybe this was the authors intention, I wound up hating Artemis and wanting the fairies to win. Not the best result when the title is named after the character you want to support. Still the book is fun and will translate well into a movie after the success of movies like &quot;Shrek&quot;, and characters kids will laugh at like one who passes gas with near military results.	2001-06-06

It begins in Finland with a boy named Esko Vaananen who becomes obsessed with the skyscraper, or pilvenpiirtaja as he knows it. Shortly after he meets a young girl who entrances him, and his destiny converges in his quest for love, and his desire to be a brilliant architect. Spanning nearly thirty years and crossing from the frozen Finland tundra to The jazz infused gang run clubs of New York City Rayner's intricately researched novel certainly brings to mind comparisons with Ayn Rands, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. Yet for many this will be a much more accessible novel. The dramatic journey the character goes through makes this book an obvious choice for a feature adaptation. A satisfying and wonderfully woven book!	2001-06-04

I wasn't fortunate enough to be able to see the stage show on which the book is based, but much of her life although couched with some hilarious witticisms is painful and sad. Drugs, alcholism, abusive relationships, and a big old healthy dose of self loathing thrown in for good measure. Reading about &quot;All American Girl&quot; and the deconstruction of the show made me wince. As always I'm baffled at the far reaching stupidity of network and studio executives.

After her lover is killed and she's seriously wounded, she is still attempting to get over her loss nearly three years later. When another technician is killed, Carol is the lead investigator in what begins to look like the work of a serial bomber. At first I thought I was going to be disappointed; About a hundred pages in I was intrigued, but not finding it the page turner I hoped.But not to worry, because soon after it kicked into high gear with enough unseen plot twists that should make it a nail biting thriller when it begins shooting as a feature. (The rights have been bought.)After Crais' great &quot;LA Requiem&quot; he still seems to exploring the darker side of his heros, this one not having the added benefit of Elvis Cole's sarcastic wit. Still, she's a interesting character, perhaps ultimately even more so since her flaws make her that much more human.	2001-05-23

Written in the seventies it almost became required reading for medical students, with many of them adopting the vocabulary used in the book. The constant high stress is sometimes only relieved by the erotic couplings of the nurses and interns, but the effects and demands of the hospital takes it's toll on each of the characters with very different results.The book definitely took some turns I didn't expect, and all in all I found this a really satisfying read.	2001-05-16

Grisham seems to be writing with a sense of humor and it's reflected most heavily with the judge's characters. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that there are no redeeming characters.

Lehane spares no punches in this tough, racist, violent city with gang fighting, and racial wars. The detecives debut begins when Patrick is hired by a group of prominent senators to find a missing cleaning woman who has stolen some important documents.What they uncover unleashes a violent chain of events.

It wrecked me. I remember sitting in my bed crying my eyes out and marvelling that this was written by a woman. The love story of Olympic track hopeful Billy Sive and his coach Harlan Brown still manages to hold up after twenty seven years.Not only is the love story effective, but the book now almost reads as a primer for the gay rights movement. Paul Newman had bought the rights originally to adapt the book into a feature, but apparently no actor wanted to take on the then controversial role of Harlan. Times have changed. Now it would be considered a career boon for an actor. Better late than never. And if you've never read this book, the same adage applies.	2001-05-01

That being said, I had a great time with his latest stab at horror involving four friends who go hunting every year, and have their plans disrupted by the crash of an alien space ship. After writing so many books it seems inevitable that he'd begin to repeat themes that have been addressed in earlier novels. The biggest is the idea of a group of childhood friends confronting or reliving their past in order to master the present. Much like &quot;It&quot;, but instead of Pennywise the Clown, there's now &quot;Mr Gray&quot;. Part of what makes his horrifying worlds so real is his constant use of pop culture references such as &quot;E.R.&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and &quot;Scooby Doo&quot;. He's also amazing at laying track; Unravelling just enough to make you keep turning the pages to find out what happens next. I didn't find it as scary as some of his other works, but I was hugely entertained. Fans won't be disappointed.	2001-04-27

Three very unlucky children whose parents die tragically and are forced to live with a distant relative named Count Olaf. Imagine Harry Potter never getting the chance to escape from the Dursley's and you'll get the general idea. The author relates their tale of woe with hilarity, including a technique of providing definitions for words that the reader might not be familiar with. Destined to become cult classics and handsomely designed and illustrated in their little hardback form, they're books you're kids/niece/nephew/little sibling will want all of.

Fans deeply invested in Bosch may find themselves a tad disappointed here. He's barely in the first one hundred pages or so, and when the book does begin to focus on him, it's as the perpetrator of the crime, not the crime solver. The story is set up on two parallel courses: McCaleb is asked by a detective friend to add his insight into a case she believes could be the work of a serial killer. The evidence that turns up seems to point to Bosch as the potential suspect. Meanwhile Bosch is the key witness in a huge Hollywood court case ala O.J. that involves a famous film director on trial for murder. Connelly is a great story teller. His books are like watching an edge of your seat thriller. And that's what was missing for me here; the thrills. As a reader and someone who loves the character of Harry, I found it hard to ever believe he could be capable of what McCaleb believes he could do. I also, for the first time in one of his books knew where it was going and figured it out. I then just wanted to get to the end to see how it would play itself out. Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's a bad book. It's certainly not boring. I just think he's managed in all his other books to achieve a level of tension and psycholgical sparring that was all but a veneer in this one.	2001-04-17

The narrator, Ned Hall, is a man looking back at his life and the person who had the biggest impact on him; His father, Sam. Ned grows up in a fictionalized town called Mohawk which is so wonderfully detailed, it becomes it's own character. It's a town dominated by it's local bars more than anything else, and money isn't the easiest to come by. Russo, like John Irving, fills his novel with a colorful array of characters who propel the story forward as Ned interacts with them, most who are friends of his father's.It's a novel that has serious comedic overtones, yet manages to maintain it's nostalgic, and slightly melancholic center. Anyone who's ever gone back to visit their parents, or visit the town they used to live in will understand the emotions he so richly captures.	2001-04-13

He's a phenomenal writer with a gift for crackling dialogue, and fascinating multi-level characters.It's the story of three boys, Sean, Jimmy, and Dave, one of whom gets abducted, but escapes. Twenty five years later the estranged men's lives converge when one of their daughters is brutally murdered.No one gets out clean in Lehane's world, and the brilliant unravelling mystery creates a tragic chain reaction. With the domino effect in mind, it reminded me in tone of &quot;A Simple Plan.&quot; I read the other day that Clint Eastwood has bought the movie rights to &quot;Mystic...&quot;.

After seeing the movie, I was interested in reading the book to get a feel for the writers voice. I'm so glad I did. Written in almost a stream of consciousness, Arenas's telling of a gay writers life under  Fidel Castro is far more harrowing that could be depicted on screen. But it's also such a testament to the human spirit, and the quest to break the confines of imprisonment physically as well as artistically and sexually. He relays his story with an unapologetic frankness in regards to his various sexual expolits as well as his bitterness towards Castro. I'm amazed that people manage to survive against so much adversity. After his suicide, we as readers are fortunate there's a body of work that exits, and after reading this biography,the books should be considered all the more precious for the risks it took to get them published.	2001-03-25

This book is a valentine to him. The plot, that has more layers than an onion takes us back to Joe's days as a cop, and gives some clues to what made him the man he is today. Elvis' relationship with Lucy Chenier also takes some turns I didn't expect showing sides to both characters we haven't seen before. More than just a beach read, this book deserves it's place as a classic mystery, and fascinating character study.

Dr Gideon Wolfe, a historian, profiler, and psychiatrist (that's the only similarity to his other books), gets involved with a group of renegades who through technology have managed to manipulate people's perception of events historical, political, and even religious. One such &quot;manipulation&quot; sets of a sociopath bent on revenge that catapults the novel towards it's whimpering conclusion. The beginning of the book had originally been serialized for Time magazine, and it feels that way. Chapters at most are five pages long, and long passages of time in the story are acounted for in a sentence or two. Consequently the characters are about as exciting as melba toast with the most distinguishing characteristics being an accent or a facial scar. I found myself asking more than once, &quot;Who cares?&quot; I think even diehard sci-fi fans would have trouble with this one. Fans of his early work definitely will.	2001-02-13

The combining of both supernatural worlds seems almost too good to resist. What a letdown. I had stopped reading her books after &quot;Lasher&quot; because I felt she was now writing at the mercy of a publishing schedule . The original allure that was in &quot;Interview...&quot; and &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; had been lost as she tried to get one book out a year and I felt the stories had become lackluster. Sadly that's how I felt about this novel as well. No one can deny that Rice is a wonderful writer, who illustrates her work with a sweeping romantic narrative, but I felt cheated here. The first hundred pages or so is almost nothing but recap from the previous novels as David Talbot introduces the title character. The promised Mayfair witches have a family relation to Merrick, but are only seen in one chapter of the book. The child vampire Claudia is used as a major plot point to propel the novel which felt old, and like an easy way out. Even Lestat seems like a hack, showing up in the last forty pages in what feels like a glorified cameo. I feel like she should put these characters to rest for a while and find a new subject to write about.I loved the early books and wanted to love this as well, and based on some of the other reviews I'm probably in the minority. However I can't say a book is good just because it contains characters I  think were great.	2001-02-08

It's a great book that managed to take the sometimes dry emotionless format of the biography, and infuse it with new life. It read like a great fiction novel, making you quickly turning the pages to see what was going to happen to Capote next.<br />Happily, after reading his new Garland bio I can say he hasn't lost his gift for penning an addictive and hard to put down true life tale. Here is the Garland everyone knows; The pudgy faced sweetheart singing alongside Micky Rooney, the Dorothy Gale searching &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, and the Carnegie Hall showstopper. But as the book progresses the tone grows darker as Garland's addictions to drugs and alcohol combined with her overwhelming insecurities begin to destroy her career and her life.<br />I can't say it's an uplifting read. And to think that she was only forty seven when she died is so tragic. But for people who have an interest in Garland, they'd find this a fascinating, and easy to read book. It would also serve as a great companion piece to the upcoming February ABC miniseries, &quot;Me &amp; My Shadows&quot; starring Judy Davis as Garland.	2001-01-24

To tell too much would give away crucial plot points, and considering the ending of the book doesn't come as much of a surprise, the less you know going in the better.

I still feel that from a technical standpoint they're probably the most juvenile books I've ever read. That in a nutshell is my biggest complaint. Despite that rather large flaw which I know discourages alot of people from continuing, I have to say I've enjoyed them. Are the books the way I'd imagine the Rapture to be? Probably not, and based on what alot of other comments I've read say, others would play it differently as well.But it's their story. The one they've imagined with the parts of the Bible they feel best suits the tale they're telling. I think people that are looking for a witnessing tool should have figured out before book seven that that's not the primary goal of these book. At least not the way I see it. They entertain. They excite, they thrill, they elicit emotion in their readers.And perhaps most importantly they get their readers talking. They get them asking about the Rapture, curious about the book of Revelations, hungry to find out more.And if that's done through a character in a story that someone's grown fond of, then that's some good story telling.Many of the people who are reading these books may not be ready for the fire and brimstone approach to the Apocalypse. I'm sure there are many people who aren't aware that Tyndale's a Christian Publisher.They just want to know if Rayford and Buck and Chloe will survive, if the Antichrist will create havoc, and if Hattie will be saved.And there's nothing wrong with that. Incidently this was my favorite one yet.	2001-01-03

She asks him to help investigate the murder of her husband, an acclaimed independant film maker ala Quentin Tarantino.As Porter's life begins to careen out of control it's easy to make comparisons with &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, seeing as both present New York at it's most deplorable, and the people that inhabit the island not much higher than base animals driven by lust and greed. Although frankly that seems to be Harrison's argument for all of humanity, turning a devilshly good mystery morality war into a depressing and gory romp through the cesspools of The Big Apple. It's very well written, but the end was a letdown. Not just for it's wimpy resolution, but also for making me feel like I should pull a blanket over my head and not leave the house.	2000-12-30

Eight stories that move backwards through time that revolve around a Vermeer painting. Through each of the stories the painting manages to evoke particular feelings in each of the narrators, demonstrating the power and allure of art.  As much as I appreciated her craftsmanship in the storytelling, the stories themselves left me a little cold. I didn't really have any kind of emotional attachment to any of the characters, so consequently I found myself being more of an observer and less of a participant.Still, it's a fast moving and easy read, and for people interested in art and artists, this would probably be an enjoyable read.	2000-12-25

And I loved Charlie. His compassion, his confusion, his humor,his longing and his love. I'm disappointed the book has beenclassified as &quot;Young Adult&quot;. I'm thirty three years old, andfound the characters and situations as identifiable as any characterclose to my own age if not more so. If the film rights to this haven'tbeen snapped up yet, someone ought to do their Producer boss afavor. If you were one of the fans of tv's &quot;Freaks &amp;Geeks&quot; or enjoyed the movie, &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, you'dprobably connect with this book the way so many people are.

Maybe it was that it didn't take place in L.A., or that Elvis' romance in the book seemed to take center stage. But all's forgiven after reading &quot;Sunset Express.&quot; Crais brings Elvis back to California where he belongs, and gives him a funny, suspenseful story with plenty of twists and turns. Oh and the continuing romance to boot, which here seems more relaxed, and not so forced.The key word for this book is lawyers. Think O.J. Think Dream Team. You'll get the picture.<br /> If you've never read an Elvis Cole novel before, you don't have to read them sequentially to enjoy them, although I find it more fun! Start with &quot;the Monkey's Raincoat&quot;, and work your way through. I had to buy this title through Amazon Zshops, But it was so worth it. Crais, and Elvis will hopefully be around for many more to come.	2000-12-22

Not wanting this triumphant trilogy to come to a close, I'd only allow myself one chapter in the morning when I woke up and one before I went to bed. Having just completed it I feel like my head has just expanded. Pullman continues through the worlds we've come to know with Will and Lyra and takes us to some new and wildly original ones such as the world of the dead, and the village of the mulefa.(Don't ask. The beauty in this is his desciptions of both.) Already I've bought the first book, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; for friends of mine so I'll have someone else to talk with about this.<br />The books have gotten stronger each time out, and this one is the tops. I also appreciated that Pullman has plenty of opportunity to dip into sentimentality, but chooses instead to write with careful restraint; the result being a moving and perfect ending.	2000-12-19

I've never been disappointed in a book that written by someone who's primarily a poet. Somehow they seem to be able to dig even deeper and describe even more richly the person, place, and or thing they're describing. Here it's her coming of age as a young teenage girl. The quest for acceptance, the awakening of sexual desire, and the discovery of the world of recreational pharmaceutics.<br />You don't have to have read &quot;The Liar's Club&quot; to understand or appreciate this book. It stands on it's own merits, a richly detailed world of adolecent minutiae.The book moves quite nicely until almost the end, where my interest lagged slightly which is the only reason I didn't give it five stars. Yet for technical aspects, and her ability to evoke feeling and emotion it should probably get a whopping ten.	2000-11-30

LaHaye &amp; Jenkins create motives for enough characters to keep you guessing right up to the last page who will be the Antichrist's killer, and even then they leave it with an almost soap opera like cliff hanger.<br />My only beef with this book is something that's just problematic in a serialized novel format:I don't honestly believe the main characters are in danger of dying before the last book. That means a bunch of peripheral characters are brought in for a scene or two, and then die, or are killed. Characters it's hard to have much attachment to.<br />However, I enjoyed this &quot;chapter&quot; in the series much more than the last, and if you're a fan of the book you won't be disappointed.	2000-11-24

I could only wish I was as brave and as overwhelmingly generous as the magical girl the book is named after. Told from the perspective of sixteen year old Leo, who falls under her charms like the rest of Mica High School, it is a wistful, heartfelt, and bittersweet narrative that ultimately packs a gentle but firm emotional punch.<br />This book should be required reading for adults young and old for it's ringing endorsement of individualism.It reminds us that like Stargirl it's okay to be different, that sameness is boring, and that we should all, as Will Shakespeare once said,&quot;To thine own self be true.&quot;<br />At just under two hundred pages it can almost be tackled in one sitting. A perfect gift for someone who may not feel that they totally belong, or that their being different is a bad thing,  or simply to be gently reminded that acceptance starts from within.	2000-11-15

The book is a feast for the imagination, and spectacularly written.A young Jewish man, Joe Kavalier, uses his fascination and dedication to the art of magic as a means to escape from German occupied Prague.He arrives in New York City, and with his cousin Sam Clay invents The Escapist; a comic book super hero who fights villians heavily based on Hitler. This is America in the forties, when Superman had just become a hit, and young boys everywhere were eagerly waiting for the next issue to see what would happen to their caped crusader. What follows is their rise in the comic book industry, as well as battles with their own personal chains that lead them to their ultimate destinies.<br />Chabon's canvas merges fact with fiction, and the characters interact with Salvador Dali, Uta Hagen, Stan Lee, Orsen Wells, and the great Harry Houdini among others. That only makes his characters so much more real as you read it, it's easy to forget it's fiction. If you're looking for the type of book that creates a detailed world with artistry in the writing, and a moving collection of characters, this is the one.	2000-11-14

Having just read &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, I wouldn't of believed Philip Pullman could top himself, but boy does he ever. The second installment of the &quot;Dark Materials&quot; trilogy begins with the introduction of Will Parry. Twelve years old, smart, and fiercely protective of his Mother, in self defense he commits a murder.Consequently, this sends him on a wild chase that at its' end finds him face to face with our heroine, Lyra. What happens then, and how their individual quests are related through possibly hundreds of worlds is the heart of part two.<br />I loved this book. I loved the addition of Will, and the beautiful friendship he and Lyra develop. I thought the action never let up for a second, and had no idea where it was headed. I also loved the focus moving from just Lyra, as it was in the first book, to ample time with all the other various characters. It made them more tangible, more easy to connect with.<br />The only thing that's misleading about the book is its' reading level.The cover art makes you think you're about to read something lightweight and sugary. A fairy tale to share with the kids. It's not! I would love to give these to my nephew who loves the Harry Potter books, but don't know if he'd grasp all the concepts Pullman is weaving. He's constantly making you question who's bad and who's good. And maybe that's his intention, and it will all be clear in the final book. I can't wait. Cause this one ended as a true cliff hanger.	2000-11-03

Look no further, Lyra Belacqua has arrived.The heroine of Philip Pullman's intricate and bewitching trilogy that begins with &quot;...Compass&quot;, is a young girl living among the scholars at Jordan College in England. Her parents, who had died when she was a baby, had left her in the care of her Uncle, Lord Asriel.<br />Like any great hero or heroine she is a child &quot;who has a great destiny that can only be fulfilled elsewhere-not in this world, but far beyond. Without this child, we shall all die. So the witches say. But she must fulfill this destiny in ignorance of what she is doing, because only in her ignorance will we be saved.&quot; So says one character to another.<br />Her destiny begins to be realized with her Uncle's return from the North where he speaks of mysterious things going on. At the same time children begin to disappear, and the rumors of what is happening to them isn't nearly as horrifying as the reality.Accompanied by her trusty daemon,(an animal companion that seems representative of the soul), a colorful cast of characters, and a great warrior Polar Bear named Iorek, Lyra sets off on an unforgettable adventure.<br />Personally, I found the first seventy pages or so a little slow going as the plot is set up, and the reading level is slightly more demanding than the Potter books. However, once the action begins to really motor along, it's a hard book to put down, and one adults and children will love equally.	2000-10-30

That's the one word that came to mind after reading Jean-Dominique Bauby's, emotionally uplifting memoir. At the age of forty three he suffered a massive stroke that led to his paralysis, a victim of &quot;locked-in syndrome&quot;. That is he was perfectly cognizant, but unable to move any part of his body except his left eyelid. Two days after the book was published in France, he died.<br />The book is truly a testament to the human spirit, and the healing powers of the mind. Far from being a &quot;woe-is-me&quot; feel sorry for myself biography, Bauby rises above that to embrace the life he remembers. A life that sometimes took for granted the simplist of tasks such as shaving, eating, or merely forming a word.<br />Obviously no one lives their life aware of every minute detail as it passes by (except maybe poets), and in fact it's not until something's taken away that we really appreciate it. However, Bauby's book made me grateful and appreciate what I have, and even if just for a little while forget about what I don't.	2000-10-30

An elderly woman working in a tea shack. A transmigrating spirit in Mongolia. An art thief in Russia. A musician in London. An Irish physicist. A DJ in Manhattan.  David Mitchell brilliantly weaves these transglobal stories together by the tiniest of threads, making it feel like a high speed express train of thoughts and ideas. One of the characters state, &quot;The human world is made of stories, not people. The people the stories use to tell themselves are not to be blamed.&quot; Each character(s) is so fully realized, so immediately compelling in their sometimes simple lives I found it hard to put the book down. In fact, I would've liked to read it in one sitting to benefit from the whole dramatic sweep of his narrative.<br />The book is not a light read, and it demands your attention, but it's so worth it. And don't be turned off if you don't like short stories. He weaves them together so well, you almost don't notice that one has ended and another's begun.	2000-10-25

LaHaye and Jenkins manage to keep the momentum moving that for me really just started  with &quot;Soul Harvest.&quot; The action kicks off in Israel with a religious summit that culminates in a breakneck escape for Chloe,Buck, &amp; Tsion. This is what these guys do best; Write great action sequences. Unfortunately even these feel strained with unbelievability this time out.To have Buck Williams fall off an ascending plane and only wind up with scratches and abrasions in almost laughable. There is on the other hand a detailed and suspenseful sequence when the destroyer, Apollyon, unleashes his demon locusts to attack the nonbelievers. The interesting thing about all the books is how the authors are going to dramatically handle what the book of Revelations has prophesized. And now that the seals and trumpets are being opened and sounded, there's plenty of obsticles for the protagonists to battle. Still, the problems I've had with the earlier books have maintained their annoying aspects. Dialogue still sounds like a bad 1940s tv show, and characters and relationships are still one dimensional. Hattie still remains the most deplorable victim of this, making her so annoying I wish they'd knock her off and put all of us out of our misery. Not to mention,who knows why the authors chose to make mention  of her one remaining relative who's also unsaved and just happens to be working in an abortion clinic. (Cause that's where bad people would work.) It had nothing to do with the plot, and the character never turned up again. Gee, had they found her in the last book she could've arranged for Hattie to get that abortion she wanted and be rid of the Antichrist's baby sooner.<br />Whatever.<br />Again, as I've said at the end of my reviews of the other books in the series, I'll continue to read the rest of them. Despite their abundant flaws I still want to see who makes it to the end.	2000-10-18

I remember reading the first &quot;Tales of the City&quot; book and feeling that I was lost in a magical world. A feeling that no book has replicated for me, until the Harry Potter stories.<br />Now Maupin returns with &quot;The Night Listener&quot;, a book that seems closer to his own life story than anything he has previously written.<br />In it his narrator, Gabriel Noone is a novelist struggling with writers block, and a breakup of his long term relationship with Jess, his former lover. After a publisher sends him the galley of a nonfiction book about a young boy, Pete Lomax, who was horribly abused sexually, he develops a friendship with the boy via the telephone. As their relationship grows, Gabriel and Pete develop a surrogate father son bond. This causes Gabriel to question his relationship with his own father, while at the same time resorting the scattered puzzle that was his life with Jess. Suddenly Maupin concocts a scenerio for a genuine page turning mystery as Gabriel attempts to discover the truth about Pete.<br />The premise for the book is where the headtrip started for me, in part because Maupin so successfully blurs the lines between truth and fiction.  The boys' story, which is loosely recounted in the novel, appears to be verbatim from a book called, 'A Rock and a Hard Place'. I had read the book years ago, and was deeply moved by it. At the time it was published it created a stir because many people wondered if the eloquent and brave boy actually existed. A similar scenario wields its's head here. Maupin also recently split from his longtime companion, Terry Anderson on whom the character Jess might be based. The fun of all this is never really knowing what's fact or fiction.  Maupin seems to be deliberately bluring the reality line between his own life, and the lives he created in &quot;Tales...&quot; by inserting a character from the &quot;Tales...&quot; series to layer the book like an onion skin. Maupin's Gabriel Noone says he's a &quot;fabulist by trade&quot; who's &quot;spent years looting his life for fiction.&quot; Again, that could be the character talking or the author. Regardless, we as the readers are richer for it.upin's Gabriel Noone says he's a &quot;fabulist by trade&quot; who's &quot;spent years looting his life for fiction.&quot; Again, that could be the character talking or the author.

Three reasons to be exact:<br />1) The location change. Part of the appeal of Crais novels are their Southern California locale. Here the plot takes him to the heart of Louisiana to uncover the mysterious past of television starlet Jodi Taylor.<br />2) A pretty lack luster romance. I'm all for giving your characters a little libido boost, but does it have to be so milk toast and uninteresting? For the first time in any of his books I thought the dialogue seemed false and forced. The relationship  between Elvis and Lucy Chenier seemed more like something to fill up pages than anything I cared about seeing develop. Which brings me to my third point.<br />3) Where's Joe Pike? Crais best character is without a doubt Elvis' partner, Joe Pike. Here he doesn't make an appearance until nearly two thirds of the way through the novel. Consequently I didn't feel the book really kicked off until then, with the thin plot feeling a little dated and contrived. Such a bummer from a usually great writer. Personally I'd suggest any of his first four instead such as &quot;the Monkey's Raincoat.&quot;	2000-10-04

Spanning a 45 years friendship between Samad Iqbal, a Muslin Bengali and Archie Jones, a Brit with suicidal tendencies she had created characters and situations both original and familiar.  Archie marries a nineteen year old toothless Jamaican named Clara, while Samad begins his married life in a prearranged union with the short tempered Alsana.  Their lives and subsequent children's lives beome the centerpiece of the book, with Smith smoothly handling ideas of race, religion, faith, destiny, and how history manages to repeat itself. Her writing style, and the ample amounts of humor she creates through her richly drawn characters is very reminiscent of two of my favorite authors; John Irving and Charles Dickens. More than once I was reminded of Irving's 'Son of the Circus' and if like me you're a fan of his, you'll probably enjoy this as well.	2000-10-01

Stir in hefty amounts of closet skeletons and blend with ample supply of alcohol, eroticism, and moody New Orleans atmosphere. Turn up the heat and watch for sparks.  Caution: Not following directions could cause great psychological pain and or death. One would think Christopher Rice's first venture into the literary world would involve some of his Mother's trademark nightdwellers, but instead he has opted to confront what some would consider much more insidious demons.&quot;Density...&quot; is the story of four friends, Greg, Brandon, Meredith and Stephen and their painful passage out of adolescence and into adulthood. Greg and Brandon are the golden boys of the football fields.And while Meredith gets in with the popular girls, Stephen becomes the discarded oucast;a victim of gross homophobia who becomes both the catalyst and hero of the story. The book spans nearly six years with parts of the book focusing not just on the kids, but on their parents as well who have their own dirty laundry that could use airing.  Skeptics who think the only reason Rice was published was for his name will be glad to know he really can write. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is that I started to figure some of the twisting plot points out disappointingly early which took some of the fun out of it. Unfortunately I think the book has some limited appeal and fans of Anne Rice aren't necessarily going to be fans of this. The reason I feel that way is that the subject matter of violent homophobia, which is so prevalent in the book, is something many people won't want to read about. And that's unfortunate because people like Matthew Shepard are proof it is alive and well.	2000-09-20

I'm glad to say that &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; has helped keep my  footing on the story. The aftermath of the prophesized global earthquake  and it's effects on our heros made this the most involving read. It seems  the authors finally have faith that their readers will remember who's who,  because they avoid the tedious recapping of characters, and how everyone  came to be a member of the Tribulation force. The other plus for me was the  minimized involvement of the severely underdeveloped female characters in  the book. From the first this has been one of the most unbelievable aspects  of the series. The courtships of Buck and Chloe, and Rayford and Amanda  seemed so wooden and forced that it's hard to connect with them. Feminists  would have a field day with lines like Chloe's,:&quot;Don't parent me,  Buck. Seriously I don't have a problem submitting to you because I know how  much you love me. I'm willing to obey you even when you're wrong.&quot;  Maybe in 1950! However, those complaints aside, the book is much more  enjoyable overall with a clever twist that catches you off guard,some new  characters who may be around for a bit, and enough action to keep the pace  at top notch. Here's hoping &quot;Apollyon&quot; is as good.	2000-09-17

When the piece he had written was said to be  fabricated he was stripped of the honor, and much of his pride and dignity.  Now after a six month drinking binge, and a recent diagnosis of HIV, he  finds himself in the potentially lucrative position of working for a woman  named Charlotte Preston. Her father Rod was a handsome matinee idol back in  the forties, and now a scathing posthumous tell all has just been released  claiming there were plenty of skeletons in his closet. Charlotte wants  Benjamin to investigate the writer. To concoct a counter tell all book  about this man she feels has slandered her father's name. No sooner has she  signed a check to Justice for commencement of services, he finds her dead.  Suddenly his investigation into the death of Charlotte and the life of her  father begin to reveal a trail of carefully guarded secrets that are only  too horrible to imagine. John Morgan Wilson manages to really hit his  stride with this novel. The previous three were almost relentlessly dark in  their portrayal of the seedier underbelly of Los Angeles. Here, although  Justice is faced with some heavy odds in his own life, he attempts to face  the demons both internal and external with renewed vigor and strength.It's  also been interesting to watch how the characters adapt and change in their  relationships with one another, specifically between Justice and his  reporter friend Alexandra Templeton  On a side note, one of the really nice  things about reading the four Justice books is I've learned more about  Southern California's topography and the region's history by his in depth  and enlightening descriptions of the surrounding areas.	2000-09-13

After reading it I could see how he'd come to that  conclusion; A powerful, beautiful, angel comes to earth and catches a  falling drunk, our protagonist Sobran in his arms. Thus begins a yearly  meeting between the two where they debate, hypothesize,and argue about  love, sex, heaven, hell, fate &amp; wine. The latter because Sobran owns a  winery. My feelings about this book are so mixed. At times it reads like a  philosophical debate enrobed in a novel that demands undivided attention.  The first third was almost dreamlike in it's telling, but I found myself  plodding through parts of the book losing interest. I could appreciate the  novel for it's artistic merits, but had no emotional connection to it  whatsoever. Like Xas, it left me a little cold.	2000-09-08

It had been given to me as a gift, and having  never read Roddy Doyle before I was anxious to see what all the fuss was  about. The premise sounded promising enough; A young boy in Ireland who  grows up to become an I.R.A. terrorist. The book is broken into four  sections beginning with his impoverished childhood that could be gleaned  directly from the world of Frank McCourt, to his young retirement at the  battered and weary age of twenty. Where the book almost lost me was his  bloody recounting of the 1916 Easter Day Massacre. This section of the book  starts literally with a bang in an almost cinematic vision of gore, glass,  bullets, and frightened young men. Not being a history buff, and especially  not European History, I was confused at what was suddenly going on without  the benefit of a third person narrative to shed some light on the incidents  at hand.Luckily, the story snapped back into for me what became a  comprehensive progression as he grew up and continued into a violent  political destiny. Doyles' characters such as Miss Dolly Oblong, the Madame  of a brothel where Henry's father works, seem inspired by the world of  Dickens for their richness of character existing in the underbelly of the  city.I was glad I stuck with it. It's made me want to learn more about the  I.R.A., and about that period in history. That's a testament to the writer  and his Henry.	2000-09-05

I was turned onto Robert Crais by my Doctor who knew I was a big fan of  mystery writer Michael Connelly. Like Connelly's character Harry Bosch,  Crais has created a tough wise cracking LA detective named Elvis Cole.  Woman want him. Men want to be him. My suggestion if you've never read him,  is to start at the beginning with &quot;The Monkey's Raincoat&quot; and  work your way through all of them. One of the greatest things about Crais'  novels is Elvis' partner Joe Pike. An aviator glasses wearing silent but  deadly killing machine. Think Dirty Harry with a drier sense of humor.  In  reference to &quot;Free Fall&quot;, I always feel like knowing less is more  when telling the plot of a mystery. The basic gist is an attractive woman  shows up at Cole's office to ask him to investigate what's going on with  her boyfriend who's an L.A.P.D. Officer who's been hiding something from  her. He claims it's an affair. She thinks it's something deeper. Crap hits  the fan, and you'll be off turning pages faster than you thought possible.  Great characters, great plot twists, great writing. Long live Elvis &amp;  Robert Crais!	2000-08-29

It's the story of Augustus Fitzwilliam, a young musician who communicates with the spirit  world through his piano. The book begins during the Civil War and spans  over sixty years and several cities including Venice, Constantinople,  Paris, and finally New York. At the heart of the story is his relationship  with an ex-slave, Issac Kemp, and an uptight governess, Alice Pangborn. The  book debates the ideas of race, religion, and love with timeless acuracy.  So many of the arguments and viewpoints the characters have are so many of  the same ones people are having today including the right to choose who you  love, the difficulties in interracial relationships, sexual &amp; racial  prejudice, and religion vs spiritualism. The grand scope of the book, it's  homoeroticism, and honest portrayal of race relations, reminded me so much  of novelist Anne Rice's brilliant earlier works &quot;Cry To Heaven&quot;  and &quot;The Feast of All Saints&quot;. Reading this, it was easy to  believe that it was a fascinating work of non-fiction and not something  that sprang from the mind of one of the most imaginative writers in  literature today. I highly recommend it!	2000-08-26
US	52978794	R1F5GXVUQDMPV9	0399145990	217600181	The River King	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	The perfect book for fall.	Leaves begin to change, the days start to shorten, a chill is  in the air,  and kids start back to school. The kids in Alice Hoffman's new novel are  attending the prestigious Hadden School near Hamilton MA. Hoffman manages  to wonderfully convey an atmosphere rich with the changes of the seasons.  You can almost smell the sent of burning leaves, and wild roses.  At the  center of the novel are a series of love stories, and here she somewhat  reworks her previous themes of star crossed lovers and hopless pining.  Woven through this is the kind of light handed mysticism she writes so well  about with a death of one of the characters and his reamergance in one of  the characters lives.  Although I didn't enjoy this book as much as some of  her earlier books such as &quot;7th Heaven&quot; or &quot;Second  Nature&quot;, it's still a charming story to curl up by the fireplace by.	2000-08-21

Myla  Goldberg has a gift, like Joyce Carol Oats of conveying great depths of  emotion with the sparsest of words. The story of little Eliza Naumann, a  very ordinary girl who discovers an extraordinary gift in the spelling of  words, becomes a painful journey of self discovery for her entire family.  The first third of the novel manages to build an ample amount of suspense  as Eliza moves from one spelling bee victory to the next. Her subsequent  winnings color the rest of the novel with her father Saul and brother Aaron  each making choices that could change their lives.  My only shortcoming  with the novel was my own lack of knowledge with the Kabbalah and Jewish  mysticism. Much of what happens in the second half of the book revolves  around this subject and had I known a little bit more about it I would've  been even more involved than I already was.  I'll anxiously await her  follow up. Hopefully this is the start of a long literary careery	2000-08-18

To pinpoint  one story over another would be unfair since they all have their individual  charm and merit, but to hear him talk about his sister Amy, (of Comedy  Central's &quot;Strangers With Candy),I almost needed a Depends  undergarment! Another treat is to hear the books on tape since he reads  most of his own material, and his voice is...unique.	2000-08-14

This book, more than the first two  really begins to paint a picture of what's morally right and wrong through  chacters who speak like no one I've ever met. The woman are portrayed  basically as weak willed puppets like Hattie, or an agressive angry lesbian  like Vera. Chloe and Amanda spend most of the book worrying about their  respective husbands who trudge forward like the Christian Indiana Jones. I  will continue to read the books because I think it's an interesting way to  explain the Rapture which I've always been interested in. I just keep  thinking I wish the books were being written by people who could create  realistic dialogue, &amp; multifasceted people, not one dimensional  stereotypes.	2000-08-14
US	52978794	R1YVJCX8Q04B28	0842329129	46316172	Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (Left Behind No. 1)	Books	3	4	6	N	Y	Great Idea occasionally marred by sophmoric writing	If you're someone who reads alot and enjoys an occasional challenge when you read, this book may not be the one for you. By taking the Book of  Revelations, and creating a fictional story revolving around the second  coming of Christ, the writers have come up with a great idea.  Unfortunately, the characters never really go beyond cardboard two  dimensional cutouts who only seem to serve as instruments to further the  plot, and the dialogue I wouldn't wish on the best of actors to try and  make work.<br />However all that said, if you can accept these shortcomings,  and are interested in prophesy and the book of Revelations you may enjoy  this book.	2000-08-08

All of the stories are engrossing and  entertaining, but to think they're all going to end with a twisted punch is  misleading. I also wonder how involving the stories would be for a young  adult audience who have been raised on &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and  &quot;Goosebumps&quot;. A few of the stories would probably have to be  explained to a younger reader.	2000-08-08
