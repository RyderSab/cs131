Ruarke Sommerville was leading his men home to England across war-torn France when he came upon a violet-eyed damsel-in-distress, who was the image of his dead love...Lady Gabrielle de Lauren immediately recognized Ruarke Sommerville as the golden-haired knight of her dreams who would rescue her from a life of cruelty...<br />Ruarke's protective &amp; possessive instincts were instantly aroused for he knew in his heart that Gaby was His Woman.  Although their countries were at war &amp; they could barely speak the other's language, their attraction was swift, sweet &amp; incredibly romantic.  But is their love strong enough to withstand Ruarke' vow &amp; Gaby's lies?<br />I was hooked from the 1st 2 chapters &amp; couldn't let go.  This fast-paced, action-packed love story left me breathless with excitement.  Both Gaby &amp; Ruarke are strong-willed people who have faced adversity &amp; survived.  Sparks fly as their fiery personalities to clash from time to time.  (I also really liked the part where Gaby learns English so she could yell at Ruarke in his own tongue!)    <br />I read this book when it 1st came out &amp; I've since enjoyed re-reading it lots more times.  It's a beautiful start to the Sommerville brothers' trilogy.  Don't miss #2 Knight's Lady &amp; #3 Knight's Honor.  They're all Keepers!!!	2001-10-28

Gareth Sommerville, heir to the Earl of Winchester, has had a great mistrust of women ever since the betrayal of his late wife.  Now determined to marry only for duty, Gareth asks his father to choose a wife for him while he goes to visit one of their vassals.  Upon arriving at his destination, he disguises himself as a lowly knight in order to root out those responsible for ambushing him.  Gareth is an adequate warrior &amp; the main caretaker/farmer among his brothers.  However, he must use all his skill &amp; cunning to win against the Harcourts' counterfeit conspiracy.<BR> <BR>I'm usually a bit leery of plots that have the 'difference in station' theme, but this one wasn't that much of a problem here because again, we find the Harcourts busy plotting their intrigues.  What really endeared Ari to me was her tendency to put her foot in her mouth at the worst possible time.  It added a very nice touch to their poignant love story.	2001-10-28

On the other hand, her fiercely independent spirit &amp; physical prowess ensnares  him like a 'siren's call'. <br />This is the last book in the Destiny's Women Trilogy, which tells the historical tale of a strong women of their time who faced the odds...and triumphed in love.

Let's just say that anything that can go wrong when settling in a new town, HAS gone wrong:  The police chief is your next-door neighbor AND he thinks she's a menace to society.  What's more, a crazy matchmaking dog keeps barreling into people.   The nosy neighbors all seem to think that getting hitched to chief will solve all her problems.  The worst part comes when her ex &amp; his mom shows up &amp; everything becomes a complete circus.  <br />Basically, I admit that the story IS a no-brainer, but it is absolutely FUN to read just for the LOL factor.  If this romance was music, I'd call it 'funky'--you'd immediately either like it or hate it.  I loved it!	2000-12-19

When I borrowed this, I only saw the word 'knight' &amp; expected to read a pure medieval romance.  It turns out that this story reads more like a fantasy-magic-romance...with an Arthurian twist!  (I know, I know--not another Camelot story.)  But it is unique in that Lancelot is the main hero.<br />When Julie is transported into the magical world of Camelot, the author's vivid descriptions of this place definitely put to mind Robin Williams's 'heaven' in the movie &quot;What Dreams May Come.&quot;<br />Overall, the story is unique &amp; interesting but dragged at some points 'cuz there were moments I felt like I was wading through a fog.  Another objection I have is that there is quite a lot of name-dropping made by the author.  Most of these are allusions to American pop-culture whose meaning escapes me sometimes.	2000-12-19

Desert sheikh Khalil is determined to save his son from a mysterious sickness.  His only hope is to travel into the future to find a doctor who can cure him... Golden-haired American doctor Chelsea Browne was in Saudi Arabia in 1993 helping the poverty-stricken Bedouins.  When a violent sandstorm sweeps her back in time, she finds it hard to believe--in fact, since she  barely speaks the language, she thought there was just a miscommunication.  In a time/place she considered barbaric,   justice is swift &amp; cruel, &amp; independence/outspokenness is deemed 'unwomanly'.  She ends up alienating practically everyone, but manages to save the kid.  Thankfully the 'magic' that brought her eventually enabled her to understand the local dialect.  When Khalil becomes attracted to her despite her 'unwomanliness,'  she wonders if she can ever go back home again. <br />Ms. Valentine took pains to differentiate Bedouins from our notions of oil-rich Arabs.  She also tried very hard to neither romanticize nor stereotype with the real actions/attitudes of such an exotic &amp; mysterious people.  Unfortunately, while she succeeded in this, I felt that it compromised the 'romance'--I mean, Khalil is nearly always curt/brusque past the point of rudeness whenever dealing with Chelsea!  Once you get past that, the story can actually be quite good.	2000-11-05

When carpenter Paul Arnussen comes forward to help the police by citing his psychic episode, he rockets to the top of their very short list.

I got this book because it was a highly reviewed medieval romance by a new author.  Unfortunately, it's a dud.  I just couldn't get into it &amp; found myself skimming a lot just to finish it.  The author kept harping about Katherine's 'weak arm' but didn't provide enough different 'views' of how badly crippled she really was.  I first thought the previous reviewer used too strong a word to describe our heroine.  Admittedly I found her klutziness VERY TIRESOME as she ALWAYS tripped over her own gown &amp; stumbled on EVERY rock on the road to freedom.  But when added to her thoughtless, hypocritical actions &amp; watering-pot personality, I'd have to agree--SHE'S A COMPLETE DITZ!  I also can't understand how she could cower away from Reynold 'in revulsion' (perhaps in remorse but definitely not in revulsion!) when he'd just shown her what joy/beauty there is in lovemaking.  PUH-LLLEASE!

Shy &amp; quiet Veronica is striving to impress her boss, the editor so  she can become an entertainment reporter.  Unfortunately, her ethereal  looks, naivete &amp; extreme shyness aren't her only problems.  Her  imagination is so strong &amp; vivid--that she tends to space out to  'dreamland' at the drop of a hat.  What's worse--she feels her fantasies  are more real to her than reality.  <br />David de Morissey is a reclusive  writer of stage plays who recently put out a smash-hit about vampires.   Little does anyone know about his dark secret.  When he meets Veronica, he  is enchanted with her &amp; her innocence.  They connect so well--for they  are both dreamers.  However, what kind of a relationship can an immortal  have with a mortal?  Is it meant to last an eternity?<br />Mainly, I was  rather disappointed with this book bec. I read reviews saying it was very  erotic.  Maybe back when this came out a decade or so ago, it already  was--but the millenium reader will find it rather tame.  Another thing that  may grate on a modern reader is Veronica's character.  I mean, she's so  shy, so lacking independence, &amp; so far out there, you'd think she was a  fainting fragile flower.  It makes me want to shake her &amp; tell her to  grow some spine! <br />I hope the rest of this quartet will prove to be much  better.  Meanwhile, for those vampire romance addicts, I'd recommend Maggie  Shayne's &quot;Twilight&quot; series, Christine Feehan's &quot;Dark&quot;  saga, Linda Lael Miller's &quot;For All Eternity,&quot; Jasmine Creswell's  &quot;Prince of the Night,&quot; &amp; Shannon Drake's &quot;Beneath a  Blood Red Moon.&quot;	2000-09-08

Perhaps because of all the forewarnings, I found the  much-dreaded &quot;All That Glitters&quot; &amp; &quot;Independent  Wife&quot; better than this one.  Unfortunately, I had no such warnings  about this book, so I really ended up very disappointed with it.  (Hate's  too strong an emotion to feel for this story bec.

New characters jumped into the dialogues without ever letting the reader know for example,(You have to GUESS this part) that Jeremy was a very good  friend or that Lady Waynflete was like a beloved foster mother.  Traded  insults coated in civility were SO SUBTLE, THEY HAD TO BE  EXPLAINED.<br />TOTALLY UNROMANTIC!  The sexual act was more like a lesson in  dominance &amp; submission.  It's always described in terms of  &quot;subjugate &amp; dominate, capitulate &amp; possess, submit &amp;  master.&quot;   For example:  There's the scene where Nicholas wrenches  Jainee's hair &amp; pours chocolate all over her dress, mouth &amp; nose (A  miracle she didn't choke!), then 'eating' at her mouth.  Then, after just  taking her virginity, he curses her for a 'whore, bawd, strumpet,  brazen-faced jade, etc.' <br />All throughout the entire book, there were lots  of long-winded &amp; repetitive phrases like Jainee's motto:  &quot;Never  explain, always attack. Attack, attack, attack...Strike a bargain &amp;  come away with something for a woman must pay...Pay, pay, pay.&quot;   Aaargh.  Gimme a break already!<br />Lastly, in my list of complaints, is the  confusing matter wherein it's the first time I've ever heard the  fashionable MEN of the ton refered as 'exquisites.'	2000-06-15

I've read all the bad reviews about this book so I only rented a copy.  Niko is the typical '80s dominatingly possessive Greek hero, while Jessica is the mistreated innocent who (Egads!) cries like a watering pot.  The  sexual tension was a lot better done than the actual sex scenes--which were  little more than a paragraph going something like:  &quot;They came  together in rapture...floated in a sea of contentment...&quot;  The writing  style sure doesn't sound like LH, but is more like Sara Craven or Anne  Hampson--both of whom I liked back in the '80s.	2000-05-15

Instead, Rik was a teenaged father who didn't finish high school.  He's not rich &amp; he's made mistakes, yet he matured into a smart, earthy, well-rooted homeboy who is VERY proud/satisfied with what his two hands can  do.  Rik &amp; Annie were incredibly strong &amp; mature characters using  very direct language.  But some characters (like the daughter) weren't  well-developed &amp; only got the story muddled.<br />..............Unfortunately the  love scenes, while quite imaginative, were rather short and some were not  that hot at all. (The anticipation was better than the culmination.)   <br />Another complaint is that the cover picture is very misleading by  showing a couple in sophisticated evening attire.  A farmhouse would've  been more appropriate.  Although I was drawn into the mystery/history of  Lewis, there were several dull scenes which really DRAGGED so much that the  effort to finish this took me All WEEK Long!	2000-05-15

Highly recommended!	I bought this book mainly because of ROBB's &quot;Midnight in Death&quot; which is, by the way,  excellent as usual.<br />CLAIRE CROSS is perfect for getting into the Christmas mood with her heart-warming story about a very  'special' elf.<br />In a departure from her usual time-travel romances, SUSAN  PLUNKETT brings you an action-packed romantic thriller about a woman who  has learned to be strong, &amp; an ex-SEAL turned FBI who still loves her,  and is unwilling to risk her life in a sting operation.  Surprisingly  well-fleshed out characters &amp; a very moving story in the same class as  Linda Howard &amp; Sharon Sala. (I'll definitely  buy her books if she  chooses to write more in this sub-genre!)<br />I didn't give this the full 5  stars bec. DEE HOLMES' tale of an old flame that never died was pretty  wimpy/tepid.  I mean, there's no mystery, no challenge, no humor, no  suspense...In short, you know this is more of the &quot;same old, same  old&quot; after the basic storyline.	2000-05-04

I'm more of a straight romance fan so when I tried this fiction, I was shocked when the author went IN-DEPTH into the life histories of  Katia, Katia's mother, Jordan, Jordan's parents, &amp; Mrs. Warren.  The story  felt like a cross between 'Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous' and  'Dynasty' bec. those histories took up most of the book while the  'not-quite-on romance' could've fit into one chapter.  Although not what  I'm used to, the story was different yet unforgettable.	2000-05-04

The great-granddaughter of the great seer Mimskin, Golde is nothing more than the village con-artist.  Sir Gavernie of Skyenvic has lost his sight (&amp; doesn't bother to adjust to it except to bemoan his fate).  He is  plagued with 3 wild kids, stubborn servants, a pock-marked face (yuck!  uuugly!) &amp; selective intelligence.<br />There were some jarring  inconsistencies like: if  Golde has a close sister-like relationship with  the nobility in her shire, why does she live poorly in the village?  And,  how did a peasant like her suddenly get real chummy with her overlord in  the first place?  Also, there were some new words &amp; expressions I found  very distracting like &quot;gleet,&quot; &quot;swevyn,&quot; which really  threw me off my reading.<br />Historically speaking, there are some gigantic   pot-holes in this story. The names of people/places don't even sound Norman  French or Saxon! (though maybe Slavic?)  Also, there weren't enough  descriptions of the castle, village, clothing, etc. to give one a firm  grasp of a medieval 'atmosphere.'<br />I bought this book bec. it was so  highly reviewed.  While humor has its place, it really seemed forced in  this story.  If derogatory name-calling is your only idea of humor, this  one's for you.	2000-05-04

Basically, this story is about lives &amp; loves ruined by oneman's ruthless obsession for power.  John St. George's failure inwinning his father's love/respect (&amp; vice-versa) turned him into a control freak with a twisted mind.  His jealous rage made him victimize his half-sister Pam--who was everyone's darling, &amp; her lover Cutter Reid--the 'nobody' whom his father was so proud of.  But a person can only take so much before wanting revenge...and doing something to make it happen.<br />In all fairness, the story had its moments 'cuz it made me cry--I really felt for Pam's predicament. While the histories that went into each major character were very detailed, there wasn't much specific info on tourmaline, mining, or the jewelry-making industry, except for some vague generalizations. Elizabeth Lowell's &quot;Lover in the Rough&quot; provided a lot more insights &amp; depth of feeling.<br />A word of caution: 'This ain't no fairy-tale.'  So if, like me, you read romances mainly for escapism, this one ain't for you.	2000-05-04

The evil Bianca &amp; the sly Gerard are both curious &amp; devious  enough to see which half will triumph as they initiate this fledgling into  their vampiric world--to further their own agenda.  <br />For other vampire  romance fanatics, I recommend Linda Lael Miller's &quot;For All  Eternity;&quot;  Jasmine Cresswell's &quot;Prince of the Night;&quot;  Maggie Shayne's &quot;Twilight&quot; Series; Susan Krinard, &amp; Amanda  Ashley.	2000-03-17

A year and a half ago, Saxon Carstairs &amp; his partner were shot in an undercover drug bust gone bad.  When he got out of hospital, he quit the Portland Police Department and lived as a recluse in the lighthouse at  Satan's Cove.

Unable to help himself, her very  presence aroused Sax's instincts--both protective and carnal.<br />I found it  just too pat that Sax's last case on the force should be connected with  Maddy's troubles.  Another objection is Maddy's smart mouth and seductive  instincts were real sharp--totally unaffected by her near death experience.   I also couldn't understand the reason behind Sax's 'rules' &amp;  reclusiveness.  His reasons for not getting involved with Maddy were also  vague.	2000-03-08

Also, the  author's obsession with anything Italian (i.e., Jessie's  daughter and the Italian nanny talked in Italian way too much, and her  emphasis on Italian rootwords like 'insolente') muddled the story.

I bought this book mainly because of the beautiful front cover and the synopsis at the back wasn't bad.  This is my first book by EAM and I'm sad to say it proved to be a great disappointment.  As far as I'm concerned,  the biggest mistake this story had was the big deal made out of the  terrible power/cruelty of Leah's father and the king's objection to Gavin's  choice of bride--and NOTHING ever came of it!  I mean, what's the point of  building up these obstacles all out of proportion when they weren't even  featured (not a single scene of a head-on climactic clash) in the whole  damn book! <br />Leah lacks spine and is really rather pathetic.  She is  completely undeserving of the title 'lioness' (HA! timid as a mouse is more  like it).  The book is liberally peppered with lavishly extravagant  phrasing which detracts from a scene's impact.  For example, phrases like  &quot;reality slain&quot; and &quot;time was slaughtered&quot; lead one to  expect something of great significance is about to happen; instead, I find  Leah just reminiscing about the past or doing something equally mundane.   Also, this book has TOO MANY TYPOGRAPHICAL AND GRAMMATICAL ERRORS to have  even been published!	1999-08-30

Amanda knows this and keeps it  secret from him even as she falls for him.  These two people from very  different worlds find that they aren't so different after all.<br />Lots of  smart mouths on this one.  The only thing that kept me from giving this a  5-star rating was the fact that Quinn--an man in his prime, is a 30+ year  old virgin.  I admit it may be possible in this day and age.

As it was, the  few scenes taking place about this New Age stuff was hardly worth  mentionning!

Wealthy sea captain Marc Aragon rescued Genevieve Le Sage as she was climbing out the window of a brothel.  She had lost her memory and didn't even know who she was, but she was sure she wasn't a whore.  While Marc was  sympathetic to her plight, he felt it was his due to be repaid for his help  in finding out about her past by becoming his mistress.<br />I disliked the  attitudes and actions of Ms. Conn's characters.  I really didn't like it  when both Marc and Genevieve always kept adding 2 and 2 and getting 6!   They kept on jumping to the worst conclusions and then suffered through  'tormenting agonies' because they didn't immediately discuss their  problems.  They don't communicate very well either:  Marc EXPECTS Genevieve  TO KNOW that certain actions of hers hurt his pride/feelings and made him  angry; on the other hand, Genevieve can't see that Marc's actions are petty  and childish.  Also, I find it TOTALLY DISGUSTING that the hero actually  SULKS(and not in a cute way, at that) whenever things don't go his way.  He  acts more like a spoiled brat!  Another point of contention is that we are  talking about Californio families here which means that they're Catholic.   Therefore, divorce, even in the gold rush era, is a definite no-no for  Catholics!	1999-07-27

I found it difficult to understand that a modern and mature American man like Ethan could be so insecure as to believe himself impotent, especially as he's no virgin!  When I found out he was a puritan, I thought that  explained it, but he's not like any puritan I've heard of.  I mean that his  puritanism kicks in only when he wants to.  I also found his 'teasing  byplay' with his mother to be more appropriate with a sibling or lover.  I  mean, calling his mom 'shrimp' and deliberately picking fights with her is  damn disrespectful.  Ethan is also such an SOB because of the way he twice  cruelly rejected Arabella, whom he supposedly loved more than anything in  the world. (Ha!)	1999-07-22

I really feel that I was cheated of my money's worth with this one!  There wasn't much 'action' and the story itself lacked witty repartee and touching scenes.   It was only in the end that Gaelle and Cerdic outwardly showed their unity.   Both characters also mistake respect and compassion for love.  Yuck!	1999-04-20

I've come to expect to be instantly hooked with   Ms. Garwood's particular style of writing.  However,this is one that's only good for one read.

Almost all of Ms. Lindsey's work is wonderful, but this one really sucks!  I don't know what in the world Ms. Lindsey thought she was doing when she wrote this story.  I could never fall for an SOB like Jared Burkett, and I  don't know why Corinne was masochistic enough to still want him even after  he had humilated and used her.  The  whole story was  &quot;choppy&quot;--lacking tender touching moments wherein they could bond  or believably start anew. I don't even know how they even had any kind of   relationship when they were both too intent on revenging themselves upon  one another.	1999-03-27
