I'll most likely buy the DVDs too, if only to be able to see the covers large and also to have a look at all the ads from the first February 21, 1925 copy onwards.<br /><br />Still, being able to see the covers on screen is not really the same as opening this lovely book and flipping through the pages.  Each year starts on a spread with a selected cover big on the left, the right has a couple of covers above a list of issue dates and the relevant artist, the next two spreads from each year display twenty-four covers 3.25 by 2.5 inches wide and I think this is a reasonable size to appreciate the artwork and follow your favorites.<br /><br />The New Yorker is probably the only consumer magazine not to have changed its cover design since the start, even the National Geographic eventually junked their yellow border for a more contemporary look.  Because the NY doesn't have cover lines the format still works, even down to using the logo typeface designed in the Twenties by the first Art Editor Rea Irvin.<br /><br />This book is just delightful and you can slowly look through the pages and enjoy the amazing range of artists and styles, the whimsy of Mary Petty or the hard line graphics of Gretchen Dow Simpson.  Whoever did the cover the quality is always maintained.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-10-02

Chris Gall is an illustrator and the great-great-grandnephew of Katherine Lee Bates so I wonder why he had not created these pictures ages ago.      The sixteen stunning pictures were engraved on clay-coated board which makes them very graphic rather than watercolor soft and I enjoyed the little design touches here and there, for instance a picture of some Shoshone Indians in a boat passing a very streamline looking waterfall or a small town snow scene with the buildings placed at different angles to each other.      The choice of image is also refreshing, to illustrate 'A thoroughfare for freedom beat.  Across the wilderness!' has a family with their Airstream parked in the open landscape or 'Thine alabaster cities gleam, Undimmed  by human tears!' showing a window cleaner eating his lunch and sitting on one of those Art Deco eagles on the Chrysler Building. This kind of originality and warmth comes across from each picture.    The book is well produced and it occurs to me that these illustrations are so good and all the same size that they are worth framing, depending on one's favorites.	2005-09-28
US	43058502	RB9BE8L09XWR4	3716513032	298258180	Sun City	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Over Bright, Arizona	Sun City, Arizona is a massive retirement community with a population of over forty thousand and should have provided plenty of creative scope for some excellent reportage photography.  I was rather under whelmed though with this book by Austrian photographer Peter Granser.  The first thing I noticed was how washed out the color photos looked, as if they are all slightly underexposed, well, maybe that's what the place looks like with the sun shining all year round but the few interior shots also look underexposed.      Of the fifty-four photos in the book sixteen show expanses of exterior bungalow wall, a bit like Lewis Baltz's book 'The New Industrial Parks Near Irvine, California' but Baltz was able to make the mundane look interesting, the Granser wall shots look tedious. Another twenty-three images show retired folk not doing too much, though by the nature of retirement communities there are obviously plenty of activities provided but hardly any are covered and this is the basic problem with the book, it is a European photographer's perspective of a place that is filled with ninety-seven percent white American, reasonably affluent old folk (incidentally, just under a quarter of these retirees have German ancestry).  There are just too few photos in the book that are worth a second look.    There is also a rather rambling photobook essay by Klaus Kleinschidt with the usual impenetrable sentences like:   'The portrait of a person is both: It is profane in that it can be seen every day, and it is sensational in that every person is unique as a phenotype, in rare moments of tension even pointing towards something beyond himself'.  Perhaps having it translated from German didn't help.    There is a photo story to tell about Sun City but unfortunately Peter Granser isn't telling it to me.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-09-27

Madison Avenue had no further use for the mass consumer titles of the day (Life, Look, Colliers and the Saturday Evening Post) once a television was in every living room.    The ninety-three ads in the book are a wonderful examples of how the set manufacturers pitched their new product to the public, there are eight ads using paintings to show folks dressed as suave sophisticates admiring their Zenith Black Magic sets or using personalities of the day, Rogers and Hammerstein for RCA, Martin and Lewis, Edgar Bergen or Bert Lancaster for Magnavox.  RCA in 1958 ran a particularly creative ad in Colliers which involved holding a photo of the bottom half of a color TV screen on a black and white set, NBC then froze, for a minute, the program so viewers could marvel at what they saw, the top half in black and white, the bottom in color, imagine that happening today.    As well as the TV ads the author has included other related material, drink ads that show the sets as a focal point in social groups, especially for sporting events, several magazine covers featuring TV sets and nicely twelve super futuristic paintings by Charles Schridde that ran in consumer magazines in the early Sixties.    The book is well produced and all the ads are readable unlike another book of ads I bought recently, 'What's Your Poison: addictive advertising of the 40s-60s' (ISBN 1933112026) which is only 6.5 inches deep and text in the ads is certainly not readable.  If you like consumer advertisements of the past have a look at [[ASIN:3822811580 All-American Ads of the 50s]], a monster 926 page treasure-trove of colorful selling from the Atomic Age.	2005-09-23

A wise choice because so much of what he covers is not exactly at eye level.  Just flick through the pages and be amazed at the amount of exterior Deco delights still standing and hopefully now preserved.    Hundreds of photos are arranged in these four chapters, Tile & Terrazzo, Glass & Neon, Stone & Plaster and Metal & Wood and as Schwartzman took them the color and compositions have a pleasant evenness throughout the pages and this certainly makes all the detail sparkle.      I particularly liked the chapter on stone and plaster with dozens of photos showing just how creative some stonemasons were decades ago, just look pages 122-123 and see six stunning interpretations of the American Eagle.    If you live in Los Angles this super book will be a useful checklist of what to see (the captions all give the street address) for others, like me, it is a good visual record of the best Art Deco gems in LA.    2007 UPDATE: Schwartzman has published a similar book about Art Deco in London (ISBN 1845132432) lots of photos especially of exterior detailing not really visible from the ground.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-09-23

At last a timely reprint (though not quite of the highest quality) of this brilliant 1973 Lampoon special.  The original was a hardback book and the contents (not reprinted from the magazine) ran in alphabetical order from Aa, Antique plastics to Zz, Zen lizard.  You don't need me to tell you that this is seriously funny stuff, beautifully written under the editorship of Michael O'Donoghue and stunningly designed by David Kaestle.    Some of the goodies I've enjoyed include ten pages of 'Battling Buses of World War II', six pages of the comic 'Deco Desperados', designed in the Art Deco/Moderne style (in my 1973 edition this has a fifth color of silver ink as an extra graphic element) an eight page 'The Name-On-Request Correspondence School of Home Study's Official 747 'Big Rig' Pilot's Training Course in Aviation', which includes an official diploma 'suitable for framing', six pages of a very wicked parody of the famous 'Family of Man' photo book, eleven page comic 'Cowgirls of War', drawn by Russ Heath in his best bondage style and plenty more articles, fiction, cartoons and comics.    Between all these feature pages there are contributions from all the Lampoon regulars who made the magazine the hippest pages around in the Seventies and Eighties.	2005-08-29

A whole range of titles (least in the US) was only for buying in the adult bookstore or the local liquor store.  This rather restricted distribution actually enabled publishers to offer fairly explicit editorial content without worrying about who might be offended.  The book has several chapters devoted to American titles with hundreds of covers and inside photos.  I was rather impressed with the number of first issue covers shown though I expect many of them never got to a second edition.    Whether the titles were sold in adult bookstores or on Main Street (volume three covers that market) the cover lines were the same, suggestive come-ons and heavy use of the word 'Sexsational'.  The titles could be a lot more explicit although there are only so many words to describe the contents: Raw, Pagan, Snap, Sheer, Boudoir, Pleasure, Sassy, Highball, Gusto, Vixen, Tip Top, Thigh, Slip & Garter, Nylon Mood oh and don't forget the old favorite, anything ending with ...O-Rama, like Leg-O-Rama.    Each chapter has a short essay (in English, German and French) followed by plenty of photos.  Elmer Batters the leg connoisseur, Irving Klaw: Mister Bondage or Milt Luros, who gave the Californian slicks a lift, are some of the personalities of the period that get a chapter each.  Europe has some coverage, especially Harrison Marks in England with his digest-size titles.  Considering that Ms Hanson has worked in the adult mag business for some years and obviously knows the market I was surprised to find very little technical detail about the magazines, like their circulation, profitability or distribution.    I mentioned in my review of the first two volumes that I felt that the paper quality should have been better and this applies to this edition.  The images are in 175dpi but they tend to soften when printed on this matt stock, especially the full-page color covers.      Still, this book covers a vibrant period of the adult magazine market with plenty of visual stuff to support the text.	2005-08-24

What I thought was so fascinating about the book was the type of image John Ganis has captured, basically the ordinary everyday environmental impact of industry and commerce and not the pollution and devastation that other photographers have exposed, like David Hanson's amazing aerial work in [[ASIN:0893817260 Waste Land: Meditations an a Ravaged Landscape]].      Ganis has searched out construction sites, mines, housing subdivisions, junkyards, landfills, highway furniture stored in fields, plenty of logging and more.  The eighty-five images are spot on and just super compositions, which says a lot because what Ganis photographs can't be moved around or changed for a better angle, this is the outdoors: take it or leave it.    The book's production is first-class, landscape with the photos printed in 200dpi on quality paper, a short caption below each image.  This revealing collection of images shows how the landscape is being changed day after day in the interests of the American dream.      ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-08-15

Television took most of the ad budget leaving print to soak up what was left with ads that reinforced what had been seen on the small screen. Still, some ads did capture the consumer's imagination, do you remember 'The united colors of Benetton', 'Just do it' for Nike, Maxell cassettes, Swatch and Absolut vodka campaigns?  <br /> <br />The 608 pages in this latest book follow the same style as the others, divided into nine chapters which do actually vary in each book according to which decade you are looking at, here Electronics gets a fifty-eight page section all to itself and not an mp3 or DVD player in sight (or a reel-to-reel tape-deck). The ads are either whole page or four to a page and they have all been cleaned up colorwise and corrected to avoid screen clash with the originals.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the section on Entertainment, loads of memory-jogging movie ads showing how Hollywood moved ever closer to the teen and twenties market. Alcohol and Tobacco contains almost the last ads for cigarettes, remember the Camel 'Smooth Character'? As with 'All-American Ads 70s' I thought the best designed stuff was in the Business and Industry chapter, agency designers and typographers could ignore the restraints that often applied to consumer ads.  <br /> <br />I now have the seven books in the series (the set will be complete with 'All-American Ads of 1900-1919) and they all reveal a fascinating look at American life and consumer culture over the previous decades. <br /> <br />	2005-08-10

Stephen Schacher went the extra mile and only ate in them too while travelling to take his photos.  This should have been a neat looking book, all the ingredients are there but it turns out to look extremely boring.    Each left-hand page has a food photo and every right-hand page has a shot of the waitress who served Schacher.  You can see what I mean by clicking on the images under the book cover at the top of this Amazon page.  The images shown are in fact better looking than the ones in the book though, all the food images suffer from a yellow cast, frequently the plates break out of the image area (that would have easily been solved by running the photos of the page) various other elements of the meal, drinks or side orders are only vaguely included.  For an alternative look at diner grub try 'Roadside Food' (ISBN 0941434680)    The waitresses on each right-hand page are also slightly yellow looking but perhaps more serious is that the pages all look so similar.  Far better I would have thought to vary the poses and show much more of each diner, they are after all bursting with visual excitement as Gerd Kittel found out in his [[ASIN:0500275831 Diners: People and Places]].  The only visual break in Schacher's book are the occasional graphic spreads that display a map and made-up receipts with details of the meals plus where and when they were eaten.    'Plates+Dishes' is a great idea that just isn't cookin', unfortunately.      Oh yes, Bonnie from Fenders Diner, Cornelia, Georgia can serve me a meal anytime, what a dish!    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-08-02

The book contains ninety-two American personal family Christmas cards and to the folks who received them they no doubt created treasured memories of the families who sent them, to everyone else, I feel, they are just plain uninteresting and dull.    Like many other visual books whose contents are individually low grade printed ephemera (matchbooks, pulp paperback covers, luggage labels, beer mats etc) when collected together they create a quirky fascination and that is certainly true of this book but look through it once and that's it.  A second look won't even cross your mind.  Bookshops probably found it was a stockroom dust catcher, too.    Unfortunately there is nothing in the book apart from the cards, no essay from Martin  Parr about how he found these items or how he might interpret their significance.  On the back cover there is blurb, part of which reads 'This is a fascinating eye-opener into American culture, as proud families everywhere (pets included) pose before the camera to send their Christmas greetings across the nation.'   Hmmm, perhaps it is best to leave it at that.    One thing that I got from the book was that the US tradition of litho printing made it possible for families to get short print runs of personal cards produced cheaply whereas the English tradition of letterpress printing meant that similar aspirations at Christmastime were expensive enough to deter most families from doing it, so it is very unlikely that there would be an English version of this book.	2005-07-25

Divided into four chapters dealing with the landscape: corporate; commercial; domestic and natural, the photos carry on the flat format of Adams, Baltz, Gohlke and others associated with the New Topographics style.    Despite appearing rather anonymous because there are no people in the photos Schaumburg does look a very reasonable place to live and Thall mentions in his short opening essay that many of the houses and corporate offices overlook small lakes and ponds, created by the developers to control flooding, this water obviously encourages wildlife.  As is usual with suburbs/edge cities/New Villages, critics will assume that the inhabitants can't possibly be happy living in such an environment but I bet they are.  Probably the best folks-at-home-in-the-suburbs book is Bill Owens stunning [[ASIN:1881270408 Suburbia]], photographed in Livermore, San Francisco.    The sixty-five photos in 'The New American Village' are well presented (in 250sreen) in the standard art-photo landscape format though there is the usual photobook annoyance of having to turn to a page in the back to read each photo's caption.  Unfortunately the captions say no more than place and date yet the images frequently, it seems to me, deserve more of an explanation than just resting on the page.    Incidentally, it is worth looking down at  Schaumburg on Google Earth or Street View, you will see a place that has matured over the years since Thall took his photos and especially look at the space between houses, the curved streets, the position of corporate and retail units in relation to domestic housing. A pretty good place to live!    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-07-24

His 'Working (I Do It For The Money)' was my next buy and the vision continued and now with 'Lesiure' I have three of the four Suburbia series.      Unfortunately I feel that this book lacks some of the clarity of the other two I have.  It seems to me that the neg files have been scoured for any photos that show leisure and then tipped into these pages.  Most of the images work but that only shows up the ones that I feel are out of place (though still showing leisure) for instance, the couple by their pool on page twenty-seven, another couple, not communicating, on page seventy-six or the lady riding a bike on page ninety-one, they just seem out of place and look as if they might have been taken by another photographer.  Several other photos seem badly cropped or peripheral to the books concept of leisure.   Another annoyance, admittedly minor, is that so many of the photos have no captions even though they show something that makes me ask \\"What's going on here?\\"      Despite this the production of the book is first-class, good paper and printing (175 dpi) and the same size as the 'Suburbia' reprint.  Perhaps the publishers will re-issue 'Our Kind of People' and 'Working' in this format to complete Bill Owens celebration of American life from the recent past.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-07-17

We've all seen those Chinese propaganda posters showing the Chairman exhorting the masses to strive forward (and don't forget to wave your little red book, or else) so why not replace his head with that of an earnest looking moggy and slightly adjust the posters words of wisdom to feline ends: 'Political power grows out of a barrel of fish'.  Or how about 'Let's sing a new song about bank nationalization and rabbit flavor chunks.'    The replacing of one head with another has been done rather well, appropriate snarling or passive pussies, depending on the original posters have been used but I thought the joke wore rather thin too quickly.  Several posters just have a switched head and some bland copy instead of developing the theme a bit more by adding extra catty related items to the background, though still keeping the flavor of the original.  Still, for the price feline fans will enjoy the fun and don't forget 'We must have faith in the Party and we must have faith in moist pouches'.    BTW Just in case you love cats and propaganda posters (unlikely, I know) have a look at Chinese Propaganda Posters by Micheal Wolf (ISBN 3822826197) a sumptuous book with hundreds of examples of the real thing.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-07-09

I've managed to acquire four over the years, all big and chunky and sort of annoying to use if I just want to check something quickly so I was pleased to come across this Atlas.      The really good thing is that it is compact enough to be instantly available on a desk or bookcase.  The 432 pages are divided into three sections, 151 devoted to geographic maps of the world, 216 pages of Factfile with a page for every country (and another map) detailing their economy, geography, climate plus people and society and finally a 65 page index with 6500 listings.    This little book contains a ton of information and seems to be nicely up-to-date, for instance it includes a reference to the breakaway state of Transdniesrtia on the eastern side of the Dniestra River in Moldova.  Throughout the map and Factfile pages there are plenty of facts and figures to keep every fact fan happy.  The design and printing are excellent as I would expect from Dorling Kindersley and at the (Amazon) price I doubt you'll find better value elsewhere.	2005-07-05

The book is in two parts, in the first sixty-eight pages he writes a readable and interesting history of this very popular housing concept and being popular it was looked down on by the architectural elite and many critics.  The second part (147 pages) is a pictorial study of twenty-six ranch houses photographed by Noah Sheldon.    It is Sheldon's photos that makes the book come alive for me.  With one photographer taking all the color photos there is a consistency of composition and color values and these 230 photos really work, with exteriors and interiors showing structural detail and the use of space.   He manages to make the work of Cliff May, William Wurster or Harwell Hamilton Harris really sparkle plus Hess has written comprehensive captions to all these images, another refreshing plus for a highly visual book.    The design and production can't be faulted though to really make it perfect I would have liked to see floor plans of the twenty-six houses.  By the nature of the ranch house, on one floor and no need for second floor supporting walls, rooms could meander in any direction and the leading architects of the style certainly took advantage of this.  The back pages have a bibliography and index.  I think Hess has written an excellent survey of this past popular house style and it will appeal to anyone interested in domestic architectural design.     ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-06-13

All the maps are in color and as well as naming every highway virtually everything else is named too.    There are four levels of maps, the central area at 6.3 inches to a mile (twenty-five pages) street maps at 3.2 inches to a mile (242 pages) urban maps at 1 inch to a mile (fourteen pages) and route planning for southeast England at 4.2 inches to a mile (thirteen pages).  It was the inclusion of these last two mapping sections that made this atlas a bargain for me.  Clearly the publishers have gone the extra mile to make this a very handy book.    I can't fault the production.  The printing, paper, color choice for various types of highway and typography on the maps and index is well thought out.  If I have a criticism it is that on long major roads there is no indication of building numbers, I have seen this feature on other city street atlases and it can be very handy to see a number occasionally.     To complement this excellent London street atlas fans of the city should check out 'London: the photographic atlas' (ISBN 0007108419 or 0007184352) a lovely book of aerial photos at three levels, central at 1:3,000 (so you can actually see the traffic) inner areas at 1:6,000 and outer areas 1:12,000.  The street atlas will be handy because it will help you identify many of the large buildings and general topography in these colored aerial maps.	2005-06-07

Because of the very competitive arena in which these publishers worked, with twenty or more new titles each month the covers were the main selling point and the three hundred plus reproduced in this book show that you don't mess with a successful formulae.  They had to show a female (unless it was for the gay market) as provocatively posed as possible with a two or three word title to complete the package.  It has to be said though that the quality of these illustrations is pretty poor which only makes the work of one or two artists really stand out.  Robert Bonfils, in particular, consistently turned out quality art and sleaze artists like Stanton, Bilbrew and Bill Ward were made for this market.  No cover design could be too tacky for this publishing genre.    The bulk of the book are the cover reproductions (each with date, publisher, author and artist credits) with several short essays in the front.  The two about soft core publishing on the East and West coasts were interesting because they actually explain the background to the publishers and more importantly how the books were distributed through the network of adult book stores in most cities and towns.  The back has a useful list of publishers and authors pseudonyms.  I was slightly disappointed with the books production though, there is no real page design, paragraphs are excessively long and columns just fall short because no one bothered to make adjustments to the picture sizes to compensate.  Despite this 'Sin-a-rama' will probably be the only book to comprehensively cover the publishing world of paperback sleaze.    ***FOR AN INSIDELOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-05-15

Predictably most of the photos are of events as they happened rather than posed images and therefore the photographers had no control over what was being captured on film but so many of them are full of fascinating detail.    The three hundred photos have been selected from the archives of INP, ACME, UPI and P&A and as you look through the pages it becomes apparent that many of the images are not necessary of great events, fortunately disasters don't happen daily, but of everyday happenings to people or places that readers would be familiar with.  The demand for photos was huge, by the Thirties the New York Daily News was using two and half thousand a month and in the case of these tabloid papers the headlines and photos were the main selling point.    The production of the book is excellent, most pages have a single photo (in 175dpi on a matt art paper) and caption, frequently reproduced in the language of the day though I do find it odd that only a few photographers are credited, the rest are just listed as Photographer Unknown. Perhaps the perfect complement to 'Picture Machine' is Marianne Fulton's 'Eyes of Time' (ISBN 0821216570) a comprehensive study of photojournalism and you might like to have a look at my Listmania 'American photojournalism, in books' for some other related titles.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-05-07

Divided into five chapters and covering a whole range of consumer titles with over three hundred covers shown.  Each one has a caption and frequently there are several covers from one title, National Geographic or Ray Gun for instance.  The author supplies a short overview of the various genres but it is the actual images that held my interest, frequently whole page or two, three or four to a page but all large enough to appreciate what the various art editors were trying to achieve.      Nearly all the magazines shown are examples of editorial design rather than just cover elements thrown together, like the 1962 'Confidential' (though even this is credited to Len Kabatsky) or the English title 'Hello' from 2000.  There are three covers from my favorite, the German magazine 'Twen' (1963 to 1967) but I was disappointed not to see some examples of Henry Wolf's 'Show' and nothing from Herb Lubalin.    If you work on a magazine or collect them I think this book is worth getting and if you want to know more have a look at my Listmania: 'A few books about magazines: covers and contents'.     ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-04-12

As to the quality of the CD cartoons on my screen, no problem.  The default seems to be fifty-two percent of the original and there is the option to make them any size if you want to, the captions come out black and are perfectly readable.  I really didn't expect more than sixty-eight thousand cartoons to be of pristine quality unless the originals were scanned and this would obviously make copyright problems, so I am quite happy with what I see on screen.    As it is I have a wonderful (handsomely designed and printed) book of cartoons and the option to see, on the CDs, all the work of my favorites, Charles Saxon, Robert Weber, Sam Gross, Chon Day and Bill Hamilton's brilliant work about the goings-on in the financial world.

This book covers them as an 'experience' and I think it does it rather well.  Don't be put off when you see it only has sixty-four pages because it includes a lot of other things as well.  There are fifty plus printed items which are facsimiles of maps (one is a German map thirty by twenty-two inches) military reports, logbooks, posters, soldiers diaries, a newspaper page, letters and more, they are either stuck on the pages or in envelopes to be removed and examined.  One of the nice things is that the reproduction of these extras is particularly good and they do really help to create the experience.<br /><br />Each spread covers one event with a mix of text, photos (with good captions) a map and other graphics all beautifully presented in a scrapbook format.  If I have a criticism it is that the maps, which have a lot of information, are rather small so I had to use John Man's [[ASIN:014023859X Atlas of the D-Day and Normandy Landings]] to fully understand the flow of events. While looking at this treasure of printed material you can also hear on the included CD (seventy minutes) the voices of men who were there and made it happen.<br /><br />This is almost a unique publication but while looking through the Amazon list I came across 'Our finest day: D-Day: June 1944' (ISBN 0811830500) which also presents historical documents as reproductions to be handled but I'll stick with this D-Day experience, I don't think it can be beat.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-03-21

Seurat's 'Models' is the best example I think, the painting is on the left-hand page and opposite is a photo of a big plastic bag of colored chocolate buttons, just brilliant!      Mondrain, Klee, Picasso, Heering and Lichenstein all get fascinating tidy versions and the Van Gogh (see the book cover above) is another winner.  I was though, expecting to see many more like the Van Gogh, that is keeping the basic painting and moving objects within it.  Too many of the examples are just moving one or two items, like the three apples in Magritte's 'Young love', placed in a triangular shape in the original with Wehrli's version just having the apples in a straight line. Why are there no examples of tidy sculpture?    'Tidying up art' is a great idea and the book is well printed and designed but I wish there were lots more examples of Wehrli's creative fun.  Maybe a second edition is on the way.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-03-04

It annoyingly can't decide if it is a collection of lifestyle or architectural photos.  I think it tends towards lifestyle.  Each house just has the architect and photographer named, no dimensions or date and the few plans are far too small to be useful.  The hundred words or so of text that describe each house is remarkably vague, for instance, this sentence comes from the Rosenthall House 'The two bodies that make up the structure create an attractive play on volumes, lending the project a suggestive rhythm that is accentuated by the tonality of the faade.'  Similar text applies to each house.   <br /> <br />I was also disappointed by the quality of the photography, so many of the interiors have a dull cast and this could possibly be in part due to the thick matt paper.  If it were printed on lightweight gloss perhaps the images would have a lot more sparkle.  Finally, the thick paper bulks out the book and because of the small size makes it rather unwieldy to handle.   <br /> <br />These interesting houses deserve a better book than this but it is priced very reasonably for the over four hundred color photos included.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-27

The author's rightly point out that photography is a printed-page medium and the four hundred and fifty titles examined, with just over two hundred in this first book, probably represent the best (or most interesting) titles ever published.<br /><br />The nine chapters give a lucid in depth review of photobooks to the 1970s with Anna Atkins 1843 'Photographs of British Algae' taking the first photobook prize.  I particularly enjoyed chapter six, Medium and Message: the photobook as propaganda, basically dealing with Soviet books in the Thirties and the examples shown are quite extraordinary in their use of images and design.  Reproducing the pages from these books would easily make a separate title.  The other fascinating chapter was nine, dealing with postwar Japanese books, again the reproduced jackets and spreads show amazing creativity and vision, not only in the choice of photos but also in the use of printing and binding techniques.<br /><br />Stunning though this book is I thought there was one particular weakness, in so many of the books there are not enough pages shown.  Many of them have two pages, for instance 'An American Exodus' by Lange and Taylor, there are fifteen spreads so it is possible to follow the flow of images or Avery Brodovitch's 'Ballet' with eighteen spreads to capture the feel of the subject.  Most of the titles though are two or three to a spread allowing mostly a cover plus four or six pages from inside the book but annoyingly there is easily room for more pages had there been a slight adjustment to the book detail text that accompanies each photobook.  The excess white space really should have been put to better use.  Despite this the paper and printing of the book is first class, the images are reproduced in a fine screen as cut-outs with a drop shadow and run of varnish to really make them sparkle.<br /><br />Parr and Badger have almost created a unique book but Andrew Roth's [[ASIN:0967077443 Book of 101 Books, The: Seminal Photographic Books of the Twentieth Century]] published in 2001 must be regarded as the first attempt to capture the essence of photobooks and in both titles the editorial concept is the same, reproduce the covers and pages rather than show individual photographs.

This latest work is a glorious celebration of the Nation, man-made and natural, in a thick chunky book and for the price this has to be a bargain.    The nine chapters cover it all, cities, rock formations, rivers, mountains, deserts (hot and cold) farming, coastlines, the land in color and finally, admittedly an unusual choice, mining.  This last chapter though provides some amazing color images, it's hard to believe the abstract looking color of the potash evaporation ponds near Moab, Utah or the red of the water created by iron ore in Marquette County, Michigan.  I particularly liked the sixty-nines pages devoted to agriculture, plenty of examples of contour farming (more abstract art shapes) and those amazing circular fields that use pivot watering systems, you just can't appreciate these when seen at ground level.  Twenty-two cities are covered over 140 pages and even here there is something fresh to see, for instance, an amazing shot of the Chrysler Building (actually worthy of a poster) or the Westin in Atlanta.    If I have a criticism it is that many of the photos could have been bigger.  This occurs on many spreads where there is a whole page photo and on the opposite page the captions and a single photo surrounded by just too much white or black space.  Apart from that I think this a stunning book of over five hundred aerial photographs by Jim Wark, he clearly has an eye for the floor of the sky.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-02-08

Since the first book in 1991 the Splash series has featured some glorious watercolor paintings.  The reason I love these books is the enormous variation in style.   In this book it can vary from the almost photographic painting of trees and a house by Steven Kozar (page eighty-nine) to the very loose but still very controlled work of Dan Burt and his flamboyant painting of a street scene in Guanajuato, Mexico (page eighteen).     I have the eight books and they are such a treat to browse through but I think it worth mentioning that they are not how-to-do books.  Each artist though, does contribute some thoughts on how they created their work and in a way this can be more valuable than a learn-to-paint book because with so many styles on display every artist has a different point to make about their creativity.    The presentation follows the style set in the first book, each spread has two paintings, and frequently one is whole page with the artist's comments and another painting on the opposite page.  The screen is 175dpi so the reproduction is good on a gloss paper, though I prefered the matt stock used in book four, it made the images sparkle a bit more.     Amazon has over twelve hundred books listed under 'watercolor painting' so there is plenty of choice but I think the Splash series has a special place for presenting the best contemporary American watercolor work.     ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-01-22

None of the cards are dated so a pleasant few hours can be spent with a car and this bus guide [[ASIN:1583880275 Greyhound Buses 1914-2000 Photo Archive]] to approximately put a year on each postcard, there are plenty of  Silversides, GM PDA's 4101, 4104 and  stunning Scenicruisers to spot.      The postcard reproduction is pretty good, too and I was pleasantly surprised to see that all the cards have a drop shadow on them which gives the pages extra sparkle. The typography and graphics on the cover, title, intro and content pages are rather dull though, this seems a common book design problem for transport publishers.    Fans of Moderne or Streamline architecture will also enjoy this book.  Strangely this aspect of the buildings is only casually mentioned in the intro.  In the Thirties Greyhound wanted an up-to-date look and decided to build dozens of streamline bus stations across the Nation.  W S Arrasmith of the Louisville architectural firm Wischmeyer, Arrasmith and Elswick designed many of the large city ones. Fans of these buildings can read all about Arrasmith in this comprehensive book: [[ASIN:0786425504 The Streamline Era Greyhound Terminals: The Architecture of W.S. Arrasmith]].  Other local architects, carefully controlled by Greyhound, designed smaller units.  The book has eighty-seven (by my reckoning) postcards of these wonderful buildings and they look just super.      Despite the circumstances of the Thirties and early Forties what could be grander than travelling in a streamline Greyhound bus and arriving at a gleaming streamline depot on Fifth and Main, the lovely postcards in this book capture some of the magic.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2005-01-16

It would be a good few years before an art style was used again to sell things, namely pop art in the mid-Sixties.    Look at the many photographs of everyday items in the book and it is clear that manufacturers copied whatever deco style elements they wanted to enhance the sales potential of their products, at the same time a group of industrial designers where developing America's unique design style, streamline and contributing more elements to be copied, a good example are the three speed lines that popped up on many products.    I think the illustrations in the book are well chosen and they really do cover everyday items in use during the Depression years and nicely the text is broken up with various interesting sidebars like the one on Dolores Del Rio's moderne house or festive season graphics or Deco Mexicana.  To compliment this excellent survey have a look at 'Streamline' (ISBN 0811806626) by Steven Heller and Louise Fili, basically a visual book with several hundred examples of everyday graphics.

As the years go by publishers appreciate the fascination this stunning movie has for the public and continue to issue titles: a scrapbook; trivia; anniversary; movie stills; (and amazingly) a recipe book  plus the video (normal and colorised versions) DVD and audio cassettes.  Stephen Cox's book is better than most and he has clearly done a lot of background research on the production and especially the cast.  Sort of left no stone unturned, either, for instance he includes the 1986 Saturday Night Live sketch where Potter turns out not to be disabled.    Interesting though the book is I wish the publisher's had made a bit more of an effort with the production, the layout is bland, the paper ordinary so that the many photos look grey and washed out, this especially applies to the stills.  There is an eight page color insert section with twenty-one images, some of which are not really worth using.  The fact that this color section required a better paper than the rest of the book makes my point and I think buyers deserve better with a title that has lots of photos.    I was made aware of all these short-comings when I compared the book with Jeanine Basinger's [[ASIN:0394747194 The It's a Wonderful Life Book]] (click to the book site to see some inside pages I've uploaded)  published in 1986, this really has to be the definitive title about everybody's Christmas classic and well worth searching out.  It has plenty of background material about the stars and Frank Capra's direction but the thing I really liked was the inclusion of the complete shooting script over 215 pages (illustrated with ninety-nine stills) and you'll get to read the original Philip Van Doren Stern short story 'The Greatest Gift' the movie was based on.  All the photos and stills look super in this book, too.    Both books are a tribute to a glorious heart-warming experience but the Basinger book is as wonderful as the movie.	2004-12-31

I recently reviewed another of his books, 'Declaring Independence' (ISBN 0966677684) which is the fourth in what I hope is a continuing series.      'Taking Liberties' is the third book and the sixty-seven exterior photos are bursting with visual delights.  To be honest they are only everyday commercial scenes to be seen anywhere but it needs a creative eye to capture the ordinary and turn it into something that just seems so right.  On page forty-three there is a street scene in Livingston, Montana, a black pick-up truck, a movie house and other business premises, a couple sitting on a bench, bits of commercial signage here and there, some sky and sidewalk all blending into a seamless composition.  So many of the images in the book have this kind of stop and look intensity.    One reason I like these books of David Graham's photos is the very clean presentation, the images are centred on the page, nothing angled or bleeding of the page edge.  This simple, classic photobook layout enhances the work shown.    'Taking Liberties' and 'Declaring Independence' are both worth owning if you like to look at an uncommon view of American commonplace.	2004-12-24

Sean Crane had the foresight to photograph each hydrant as representing its location, for example Montana has the unit butting into a wide skyscape, Richmont, Vermont has its hydrant as part of a snow scene of children playing in front of a church, the caption says: Shades of Rockwell.      Fascinating as these photos are I was rather disappointed by the book's design.  Each spread or page has the photo presented in a different way and this creates an artificial busyness that is not needed, the photos are strong enough in themselves to work well in a formal photo book format: generous margins, captions and graphics centred below each photo, a very thin black line around each picture to crispen the edges to prevent light areas merging into the book's paper.  As it is the layouts gives the impression that perhaps several people contributed photos about the same subject.    I thought the layout of American Hydrant unfortunately letdown an interesting visual idea.  BTW, you can see twenty-four of these photos on Sean Crane's website.	2004-12-24

Jeff Brouws writes, in his interesting introduction, about the typical train photo of the distant past being the 'a smoking wedge', that is, a three-quarter angle shot showing the front and side of an engine with the rest of the consist disappearing into the distance in a wedge shape and don't forget the smoking stack.    Fortunately for us Mr Steinheimer pushed this rather narrow view of photography a lot further and took great photos of trains in an environmental setting.  The 153 images in this book are most likely some of his best work and they all reveal the Steinheimer characteristics: beautiful framing, compositions, tonal qualities and well-chosen subject matter.  His compositions and framing just seem so right and the only other train photographer who has a similar ability, in my view, is Greg McDonnell.    The selection is first class, steamers and diesels, day and night (and many in snow) yardwork or out in the landscape.  A nice touch, I thought were the frequent shots of railroad folk going about their business.  Turn over the pages and frequently a photo will grab you, like plate 139 taken in 1952 and looking down on Green River station in Wyoming, it is a real life version of a model train layout with the people, cars, buildings and Union Pacific's City of San Francisco frozen in time or plate 144, a 1964 Santa Fe depot interior shot showing the operator's desk and bursting with visual detail.    As this is an art photobook I'm pleased to say it looks the part, the duotones are beautifully printed on excellent paper, the layout and typography could not be better.  I think this book is a wonderful record of one of the few great train photographers.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-12-12

Admittedly the reduced size does not quite have the impact of the originals (the two books were just a bit smaller than LP covers featured inside) but I don't think it lessens the impact of these great designs<br /><br />Most of the work is by Reid Miles and over fifteen years he created about five hundred LP covers, frequently using the gutsy black and white photos of musicians taken by Francis Wolf.  Many of these great photos have a black background because they were taken in the windowless studio of Blue Note's main recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder.<br /><br />Considering that plenty of these cover designs are well over forty years old they still look fresh and dynamic.  I think it is because they are really quite simple, a great photo, straightforward typography and perhaps Reid Miles secret: the clever use of space.  Flick through the pages and cover after cover have empty areas, these helped to create the Blue Note look.  Most LP covers were usually designed to avoid empty space, \\"fill that hole with the track titles\\" was no doubt a common cry in record company marketing departments.<br /><br />This compact paperback is a lovely reminder of some wonderful work by a designer who created so much from so little.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-12-12

I bought this book years ago and this is a timely reprint but I doubt I would have bought it now.  This is because of the production, all the lovely ads have just been copied as whole originals without taking the trouble to separate the color graphics from the flat color headlines and copy.  Doing it this way means that none of the photos or illustrations sparkle and frequently the ad copy is very light and not too readable.    Another reason I would probably not have bought it is because I have a copy of 'All-American Ads: 50s' by Jim Heimann (ISBN 3822811580) which has two hundred car ads from the Fifties over 188 pages (in a 926 page book) with much better production so that the images really look good, even on the pages with four ads.    It is unfortunate that the ads in 'Cruise-O-Matic' do not look as good as they should because they celebrate a particular American stylistic exuberance of the past.	2004-12-04

This really is an impressive work!    The seven spreads provide a dazzling three-dimensional experience, the first showing the Golden Gate Bridge, cleverly uses printed plastic for the upright bridge wires,  incidentally the bridge is also shown in 'The California Pop-up Book (ISBN 0789305003) and opens to a rather ambitious forty-one inches wide with thin string used to represent the wire uprights.  Next the Great Plains has rows of crops, a farmhouse and a windmill, as you open the spread the silver paper windmill actually turns, the Mississippi River reveals a paddle steamer whose paddles create a spray made from some silver twine fixed on a plastic spindle, that again, turns as the spread is opened, the Statue of Liberty (the last spread) reveals a white Manhattan behind her and the Chrysler Building is clearly shown.  It is this last spread where Sabuda gives us his usual 'extra', an additional ten page little book with the lyrics of From Sea to Shining Sea and four more pop-ups, one of which is the space shuttle Columbia.    If I have a criticism it is that perhaps there is too much happening. I liked 'The Night Before Christmas' because the pop-ups were basically a large moving item and smaller items that moved with it, in 'America the Beautiful' some of the spreads have individual pop-ups that don't always work as they should because they are not directly connected to the main item.  Sabuda has, I think, slightly allowed for this by having a thick spine (almost two inches) to the book so that the paper engineering is not crushed and damaged when the book is closed.  Other reviewers have mentioned the lack of color, the pop-ups are white but the pages of the book are flat graphic colors, to me this suggests that this book, like the two Christmas books, are aimed at adults and their children rather than an obvious children's book.    Sabuda has had to interpret reality with this book and remarkable as it is I don't think it is quite as good as his two Christmas books where he treated mythical themes with such creativity and elegance.	2004-11-30

The items are carefully arranged so you can get an appreciation of what they looked like and don't be put off because the book has only sixty-two pages, it opens up to spreads twenty-one inches wide by fifteen deep and includes 1400 items in color.    Like the other Scrapbooks what is shown is the everyday stuff that could be found in any British home and as this is the Seventies, one spread is devoted to the change to decimal currency in 1971.  The spread for groceries and the one for cleaning and toiletries probably show more than two hundred examples of packaging.  Pop music with four spreads is a bit too much though.  The list just goes on, fashion, television, cigarette packets, comics, film posters, board games, confectionary, car brochures, football, magazine and newspapers and more and more.  Every time I look through these Scrapbooks I find something I hadn't noticed before.    If you are interested in what printed matter was in the average British home during the Seventies this book will show you.

She has had plenty of experience in this section of the magazine trade.<br /><br />This volume covers the fourteen years from 1945 and really it is not too interesting until Hefner starts Playboy in 1953.  Until then the market was basically down-market cheesecake and burlesque oriented magazines though there are chapters devoted to John Willie's 'Bizarre' and Lenny Burtman's 'Exotique' but these were hardly mass-market titles.  Chapter three, nicely, features titles from Argentina and Mexico and chapter six covers England.  Playboy was the title that makes this history interesting, unique when it first came out but not for long, titles like Nugget, The Dude, Swank, Rogue and others made this genre of publishing sort of respectable.<br /><br />The seventeen chapters follow the same format, a few hundred words of copy and then pages and pages of covers and spreads from the various titles. Chapter sixteen features the Top 5 Cover girls, Diane Webber, June Wilkinson, Jayne Mansfield, Bettie Page and predictably Marilyn as number one.  Chapter seventeen is a neat finale, devoted to the tacky ads that appeared in the back of many men's titles.  Major advertisers totally shunned most of this market for obvious reasons.<br /><br />Fascinating though the book is I do have a major disappointment (so four stars) and that is the paper, a matt stock that soaks up the ink so that none of the covers sparkle.  I've bought several other pop culture Taschen books this year and they have all had semi gloss stock that reproduces covers and illustrations so well.  There are a few hundred color covers in 'The History of Men's Magazines' and frequently the whole page ones look soft and grainy, they are, after all, reproduced from something already printed, a different paper would have mostly avoided this.  Another slight annoyance is the three-language text (English, French and German) all set in the same typeface so at the end of a column one naturally goes to the next column and it is German.  To my mind it would have been preferable to run each language in its own text block.<br /><br />Apart from the paper I thought the book was well worth having and if you<br />read the Product Description you'll see what the other five volumes cover.<br />When complete I think this will become the definitive work about this<br />corner of the publishing world. I'm already making shelf-room for the set.annoyance is the three-language text (English, French and German) all set in the same typeface so at the end of a column one naturally goes to the next column and it is German.

The eighty studios included have from six to eight spreads showing stills, roughs, storyboards and sometimes model sheets.  The color, design and printing are first-class.  Most of the studios are American, no surprise there but the rest of the world gets a good showing, England, France, Holland, Brazil, Russia, Australia, Japan, Portugal etc. Having so many countries helps to produce an amazing range of styles.    The several hundred beautiful images in the book are all very well but animation implies movement and this is where the DVD comes in, divided into these sections, Short films, Excerpts, Trailers, TV commercials, Making of and finally a Show Reel, it all adds up to three and a half hours viewing!  My favorites are the work of Little Fluffy Clouds and Duck Soup Studios but again the work is from around the world and so really varied.    'Animation Now!' is a super package just as a book but throw in the DVD and it surely is a 'must have' goodie.	2004-11-23

The rest of us can leave this quirky book around and I bet anyone seeing it will pick it up and flick through the pages.  The seventy-eight photos show the best and no doubt the worst of what the road professionals have to offer to speed traffic flow.  <br />Unfortunately, for a highly visual book the presentation does not bring out the best of what these structures do.  The photography is average and I thought many of the shots should have been color corrected and better cropped.  They are presented one to a page and many of the roundabouts are not even worth that, the dull ones could easily have been placed four or more to a page and that would have allowed some of the great ones to run over two pages, Birmingham's Spitfire for instance or Swindon's five-and-one construction, this must surely be unique as it looks like one huge reverse-flow.  I thought the biggest mistake was to show twenty-two photos as ovals, roundabouts at eye-level just don't fit that shape.<br />This book is a bit of fun but I think it could have looked so much better.	2004-11-21

What words will express it?  What image or idiom will make it clearer?  Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?  Could I have put it more shortly?  Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?  Although he was referring to writing I feel these thoughts could easily apply to publication designers and Derek Birdsall's book is a fine visual example of putting them into practice.    I thought the clever thing about the book was the way it explains design by using examples of Birdsall's work, so you get to see plenty of his spreads and their presentation is the design explanation.  The two chapters, 'The process of book design' and 'Book design in practice' covers a whole range of creative solutions.  Throughout he offers thoughts and practical observations with the second chapter devoted to many spreads from books and here I found perhaps the most fascinating section, his re-design of 'Common Worship, Services and Prayers for the Church of England'.  Surely the ultimate creative (and intellectual) challenge, 860 pages, type only and two colors.  As a publication designer I've always maintained that the most rewarding   jobs are the simplest in appearance, airline timetables or tax forms for instance, where the creative resources are limited yet the information conveyed needs to be totally unambiguous.  Birdsall's design solution to 'Common Worship' looks so right that you are not aware of the design and that is just as it should be.  The back of the book has sample text settings (in foreign languages, too) and some very hands-on information about grids for books.     'Notes on book' design is beautifully produced and printed and a first-class review of a leading book designer's work. I think it looks so good I've added it to my Listmania, 'My favorite well-designed books' list.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-11-17

The foibles of the English language make an obvious trap for the unwary foreign brand-manager, why is a French butter called Noisy or a Dutch beer called Slag? Of course many of these products just use the language of the country (like a Polish sugar called Wars) that is spelt the same but has an entirely different meaning in English.    The book does look rather good though. The 113 packages are displayed mostly one to a page (with perhaps just a bit too much white space surrounding them) the page numbers are created from those little sticker price tags and the index is a handsome spread with a small square photo section of each package. If I have a criticism it is that turning the tiny type captions sideways in the top left corner of each spread makes them awkwardly unreadable.     So, a fun title for creative professionals who can ponder on why a Ugandan body spray (page 129) is called Prison.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-11-14

Despite the contents being at least seventy years old there is plenty to enjoy in the six hundred plus pages. Unlike the other volumes the most noticeable thing is the lack of color photos, illustrations provided the imagery and this is why I found the book so interesting, the range of styles is amazing. The ninety-four car ad pages show the product in precise (though exaggerated) detail, the hundred pages of Fashion and Beauty ads range from hard, flat graphics to pure whimsy and the Food and Beverage pages, where most of the ads have a package somewhere which had to be painted. No color photo pack-shots here. I did find two color photos, least I assume they are, for Buick (page 132) and Agfa (page 314) and imagine they must have been some of the very earliest examples of commercial color photography. <br /> <br />Predictably most of the ads are rather staid in their design, small headlines, plenty of copy and a picture but this throws up several eye-catching ads, Marmon cars, Celotex building products, Hart Schaffner and Marx clothing or the very graphic designs for the National Association of Book Publishers. If you like to read copy you'll be pleased to see the famous 1923 Jordan cars ad 'Somewhere West of Laramie' which ran in the June 23 Saturday Evening Post and at the time made quite an impact on the public. <br /> <br />The book is beautifully printed and illustrators, in particular, will really enjoy the range of styles in these ads. Other buyers will want this last edition to complete the set. The six books (weighing in at thirty-two pounds with 4758 pages) probably have well over five thousand ads and show a fascinating history of American consumer culture.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-14

On page 558 of this stunning photo book there is a studio shot taken in 1960 by Bill Sumits of thirty-eight Life photographers, surely the only time in history that so many great photographers have been together in one place and it is amazing to think that the ninety-nine featured in the book were all on the staff of this one publication.    The book is arranged alphabetically and each photographer gets between five and eight images plus their photo and short hundred or so word biography.  Now it's possible to see who took so many images that defined a moment and became classic examples of photojournalism and also to see other examples of their great work. John Loengard's introduction does not say so but I assume all the photos did appear in Life and they cover the years from 1936 (when the title started) to 1997.  The book is well designed with mostly one photo per page (well printed in 175 dpi) and a caption and nicely some photos get longer captions where a photographer reveals some background detail about their images.      There are a lot of news type photos here, especially from the Second World War years but equally as many taken from the photo-essay style work that Life became famous for.  Others show celebrities and ordinary folk going about their lives.   These photos are so good that you have to stop and really take notice of what they are telling you.  I think this wonderful book is a strong visual reminder of how great Life was.    A fascinating book that came out some years ago: [[ASIN:0821207423 Great Photographic Essays from Life]] and still available (quite cheaply, too) has twenty-two photo essays reproduced slightly smaller than they originally appeared in the weekly.  I found it fascinating to see how great photos, which I've seen many times in other books over the years, were presented on the page.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-11-13

Abigail Gumbiner and Carol Hayden had the wonderful idea of photographing examples of motels and their signs before they vanished.  The buildings are mostly around the Tuscon and the Sonora desert area but unfortunately with no captions (or dates) it is difficult to know exactly where these fading treasures were located.  This was not the only disappointment I had with this book.  So many of the signs are photographed against a dark blue sky which, I thought, really subdued their impact, others were badly cropped (plate thirty-three).  The non-sign photos, for example the pool images (plates forty-four to fifty-three) are not really worth a second look and others of chairs, close-ups of doors and motel walls are rather ordinary.  The book design does not help either, I felt all the photos could have been larger and so reduce the excess of white paper surrounding each image. <br /> <br />I was expecting to see in this book photos of the same color and composition quality as David Graham's in his two books, 'Declaring Independence' (ISBN 0966677684) and 'Taking Liberties' (ISBN 0966677668) both cover, so well, the fading sights of the American highway and small towns.  <br /> <br /> The first (and most likely last) serious analysis of the sign genre is Lisa Mahar's 'American Signs' (ISBN 1580931197) where she discovers \\"Form and Meaning on Route 66\\" motels and their signs and goes into the subject with perhaps more detail than I would have thought possible, loads of photos, too.  <br /> <br />  <br />	2004-11-12

Well, it might have been a good idea at the time but I bought this book at a really low, low remainder price and the bookshop, distributor and publishers probably made something from it.  It is after all called a 'dream catalog' and I guess that sums up the idea that buyers would use it as guide to trendy stuff  available on the net, trouble is so much of it is completely out of date.  The best place to look for these dream items now is probably on Ebay.<br /><br />So why did I buy it?  Because it just looks an amazing book and for the price it is a brilliant visual record of product design at the turn of the century.  Divided into four parts, In the home, Fashion & beauty, High-tech (the section that is most out-of-date) and Sport & leisure, with each of these sub-divided too.  Each page has, on average, six color photos so there are about three thousand in the book and as they are mostly products they are all presented as cut-outs floating on the page and this is why I think the book looks so stunning. Each product has a caption including country of origin flag, web address and a few descriptive words, no prices obviously.<br /><br />Product design folk and trendies who go for the slightly out of date will love it and possibly it might just become a hard to find (and expensive) book in the future known as Yesteryear's Style Guide.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-11-09

Look through this wonderful selection of Andreas Feininger's photos and you'll realise why he is considered one of the photography greats.

Several of photos are so well known that they are readily available as posters and frequently appear in history of photography books.<br /><br />The seventy-six duotones (all beautifully printed) are exterior photos and capture America from the Forties to the Sixties, twenty-one are nature oriented and the remainder show cities, suburbs and industry.  Included is the famous 1942 midtown Manhattan shot taken with a tele-photo lens from twenty-five miles away and the use of this lens became his speciality.<br /><br />I like his photos because, nicely, many of them show everyday America, like the two taken in 1947, Route 66 in Seligman, Arizona (page 51) and Atlantic City beach (pages 31-31).

Beautifully designed, accessible and I thought very comprehensive in its coverage. Starting with blown and cased glass then pressed and moulded, iridescent, enamelled, painted, stained, engraved and finally cut glass.  Each of these sections is broken down into national styles, for instance, the Scandinavian section of blown and cased glass covers Kosta Boda, Orrefors, Holmegaard, Riihimaki and Karhula-Iittala.  All the glass shown has a caption that includes a dimension and price guide.  The back of the book includes a glossary, dealer and museum addresses and that all-important index.    A particularly interesting chapter is the last one, contemporary and studio glass.  Eighty-two artists are featured with one or two examples of their work.  This is beautiful fine art glass and with some items it is hard to believe that they are made out of such a brittle substance.  Predictably, there is not much in this section costing less than a thousand dollars.    I think it is worth commenting on the presentation.  All the pages are very cleanly designed with typographic clarity for the main text, captions, key dates and designer information.  The photos (over a 1,100) are presented as cutouts and almost jump off the page, all this glass looks just stunning.      BTW.

Intriguing in that most of the exterior shots, especially the news photos still sort of look black and white, the overall colors that come across are grey and beige.  This only makes the remaining photos, mostly interior studio work, seem dazzling.  The cost of producing, in print media, regular color images was too expensive so color was basically left to advertising until the mid-fifties.  It wasn't until the late seventies that color art photography was finally accepted.    The book certainly has some fascinating photos, not so much the political figures and celebrities of the time but images of everyday life.  It is here that I thought the book was rather disappointing, of the 207 photos about a quarter are studio portraits of celebrities, just the sort of photos that were printed in color on magazine covers to be found on any newsstand.  I would have preferred to have far fewer of these portraits.    If you are interested in color photos from the past have a look at [[ASIN:0810943484 Bound for Glory: America in Color 1939-43]]  with 175 images of daily life in America (and fortunately no celebrities).

What really pleased me was the half page flap on each right-hand page, so as well as a pop-up on each spread there is another to discover underneath this flap, twelve pop-ups in all. <br /> <br />The 'Night Before Christmas' book is even more dazzling and I bet it pushes to the limit what is possible with a mass-market pop-up book. The format is the same as '12 Days' (though there is no flap on the sixth spread) but it is more creative, just wait till you open spread three and eight reindeer don't just pop up they jump towards you at the same time, spread five has Santa popping up and above the top of the book. The last spread is the most ambitious, a little village arises, with six cottages and background clouds, pull a tab and Santa (printed on clear plastic) travels across a snowy gap in the clouds. The book is printed in flat graphic colors and there is a clever use of white card stuck on itself to create additional three-dimensional effects. <br /> <br />Sabuda is to be congratulated on creating some stunning paper magic that really does have to be seen to be believed.

The work of a hundred and fifty artists beautifully presented so you can compare their output, from the fragile, design oriented style of Maki Kusumoto to the gutsy in-your-face work of Tetsuo Hara or the child-like whimsy of Momoko Sakura.  Each illustrator gets four pages, two with sample artwork and two for biographic detail and three cover reproductions in color.  The back of the book has a Manga glossary and websites for some of the artists.  I have a minor criticism of the book though, annoyingly the page numbers are only on the first spread of each artist and then positioned right into the spine.    Wait, there's more!  As well as pages and pages of great comic artwork you get a knockout DVD, too.  This has interviews with three artists, Usaruara Furuya, Naoki Urasawa and Reko Okano, lasting an hour and nicely they are presented as if they were speaking from frames on a comic page, plus there is a tour and interviews with four comic shop managers but the really great feature of the DVD are the nine hundred covers (presented in color and two at a time) and if you looked at each one for ten seconds you'll be watching for two hours and thirty minutes.

I have another of his photo books 'Only in America' (ISBN 0394582152) and 'Declaring Independence' is sort of a continuation of the theme: the everyday Americana landscape.      The photos are mostly exterior, allowing Graham to get on with capturing his great compositions without the restraints of interior space and light.  Many of them include some lettering or signage helping to reveal how American's express themselves in the environment but don't expect to see any folk here, these are photos of places and things.    Of the sixty-eight photos there are a few, I think, that don't quite work, mainly those that don't have a natural framing of sky or lack any edge to the main focal point.  Most of them though, just look super and if you are collector of commonplace photo books (I certainly am) you'll want to have this latest instalment of Mr Graham's American vision.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-10-04

The format is the same as '12 Days' (though there is no flap on the sixth spread) but it is more creative, just wait till you open spread three and eight reindeer don't just pop up they jump towards you at the same time, spread five has Santa popping above the top of the book.  The last spread is the most ambitious, a little village arises, with six cottages and background clouds, pull a tab and Santa (printed on clear plastic) travels across a snowy gap in the clouds.  The book is printed in flat graphic colors and there is a clever use of white card stuck on itself to create additional three-dimensional effects. <br /> <br />Sabuda is to be congratulated on creating some stunning paper magic that really does have to be seen to be believed.  Children (and grown-ups) with a sense of wonder will find this pop-up book quite enchanting! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-03

This latest Taschen pop culture book covers the 'armpit slicks' of the American post war years and it will most likely turn out to be the definitive guide to these magazines. The seven chapters more or less cover all the adventure any male would want (or be able to handle) ferocious animals, sex-crazed pirates, restless natives, death on the front line, Nazis passion slaves, red and yellow perils and lastly, just plain ordinary trouble down your street.  All of this action is revealed in over a thousand covers, either one (almost life-size) or four to a page and they are all beautifully reproduced.    The introduction reveals the history of the men's adventure mags and it seems that the 1958 Supreme Court decision to weaken the Government's ability to regulate printed obscenity encouraged this rather small corner of the media to expand the market with plenty of new titles, fortunately they only lasted a few years before morphing into 'skin' magazines of the Eighties and Nineties.  Yet despite being able to be very explicit with cover art the publications avoided showing the prominent females in any situation that could be considered obscene (shock, horror!) but look through chapter five (A bonfire in hell for the Nazis' passion slaves) and see plenty of illustrations showing helpless, bound females subjected to extreme depravity and torture.    As well as the garish bright illustrations, which I expect basically sold them on the newsstands, the cover lines clinched the sale, a whole bunch of men could not resist buying and reading (really!) for example, New Man's Peril, January 1965, with these lines, Crazy cats who pretend they're chicks, We smashed the nympho virgin ring of the Pasha pimps, The tattoo gang's vicious kidnap torture of the society debs and The bizarre \\"ugly parties\\" of London's kink cultists. All for a mere thirty-five cents, too.  At the back of the book a short piece about the publishers of these magazines says the quality ranged from the competent to the sub-literate, how very true.    This book examines the same cover material as 'It's a Man's World' by Adam Parfrey (ISBN 09229915814) which came out in 2003, it had a bit more text and a very informative title and artist listing but I prefer the Taschen book because it so visually comprehensive and looks a much better production.  Besides the covers there are examples of editorial art used to illustrate the 'true' articles plus a biography of writers and thirty-five artists.     These titles seem to be uniquely American and 'Men's Adventure Magazines' does a beautiful job of covering this extinct format.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-10-01

Some wonderful material has been selected, the chapter on the Great White Way has a spread of eighteen beautiful theater (always spelt theatre) programs and over the page illustrator Franz Felix has four stunning covers for Theatre Magazine. A nice touch is a page of eleven half-torn theater tickets (1947 to 1958) produced, it seems, by some local jobbing printer.  Sign Spectaculars chapter includes ten postcards from 1914 to 1955 revealing the amazing neon displays around the Square.  I've always noticed, over the years, the Bond Clothing store and their neon claim of Two Trouser Suits, now long gone I expect.      The nine chapters just about cover everything the Square had to offer and the range of graphic material shown is very impressive.  Well designed and printed, I think this super book will interest graphic designers, pop culture fans and New Yorkers who want a souvenir of their famous Crossroads of the World.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-09-26

Scene of crime photos like other professional images (medical, a racetrack photo-finish, IDs, speed cameras etc) don't need to worry about creative input, they just need to give basic information, tell a story and that's it.  The 133 case study photos in this handsomely designed and printed book certainly captured my interest and I wanted to know more.     At this point the first problem arises, all the captions are at the back of the book, despite the fact that many of the photos are on pages with plenty of white space.  At the back the photos are presented as thumbnails but even here it gets confusing, the captions are in a separate text block to the thumbnails.  The reality is that all the captions could easily be with the relevant photos if the book had been designed a bit differently or if the captions had to be in the back they should have been placed below the relevant thumbnails.    There might be a reason for this rather inadequate arrangement though because (problem two) there are sixty-five photos, which when you turn to read the caption, you'll find the photo date, a one or two word description and then 'Case information unavailable'.  So, amazingly, for about half the photos in the book there are no captions, no story to tell.  To my mind this seems a fairly fundamental editorial failure especially considering that the LAPD archives probably contain over a million case photos and surely 133 could have been selected that had their case material available.      As to the photos, they are the usual selection of battered and bloodied bodies in car wrecks, living rooms, bedrooms, eateries or just plain anywhere, ransom notes (bank robbers are not a very literate bunch) mug shots and plenty showing the ordinary, mundane detritus of crime. Historically they cover the twenties to the seventies and fortunately you'll find no celebrities here.    There seems to be a growing interest in publishing crime photos, I have a copy of  'New York Noir' (ISBN 0847821722) abeautifully produced book of images from the archives of the New York Daily News and the rather more crudely produced (and this probably gave the photos more impetus) 'Death Scenes' (ISBN 0922915296) a very explicit collection of photos collected over the years by LA detective Jack Huddleston.    'Scene of the Crime' is an intriguing book that could have been far more interesting if it had delivered all that it promised, so only three stars.  BTW, if you are sensitive about photos of dead bodies don't buy it.	2004-09-26

Eight strips from the first twenty-three issues of Mad are included but unfortunately not the famous Comic Book Sounds Effects (issue twenty, 1955) drawn by Wally Wood but what is included is a life-size reprint of a newspaper comic section, the 1959 'Sunday Comic Section we'd like to see', which includes a brilliant satire of Ripley's Believe It or Not!   <br /> <br />If you read the newspaper strips over the years you'll really enjoy this parody paperback, which is a neat production job, too.  <br />	2004-09-21

This is typical of those overpriced books that come out for buying in the festive season but the good news is that after December you can usually find them at a greatly reduced price.  I got my copy via the Net at well below ten dollars.    Read the Book Description above to find out about the contents of this thick coffee table book.  Most of the two hundred and fifty photos (all publicity shots) are one to a page with long captions and covers of the Guide, more than four hundred, pop up at relevant places.  Other covers are shown on five spreads devoted to each decade and actually I would have preferred the book to have concentrated on the covers rather than the publicity photos, a lot of well known illustrators were used, like Jack Davis, Ronald Searle, Al Hirschfeld, LeRoy Neiman and Bob Peak to name a few.     I did like the way the material was divided into themes, Weekends, Daytime, Evenings, Prime Time and Late Night, rather presenting it all in strict historical order.  The back of the book has an interesting complete list of covers from April 1953 to April 2002 but unfortunately it is set in a real tiny type (Day-lite Sans would be an appropriate font name).    If you can find this book at a low, low price it will certainly be worth buying.	2004-09-21

Dolores Hayden's intriguing book visually decodes fifty-one examples of bad building in the landscape and the use of aerial photography to do this was a good idea, sprawl by its nature stretches off into the horizon but when seen at ground-level could seem pretty ordinary.  Some of the differences though, especially with domestic dwellings, seem a bit arbitrary, there are seven examples of housing shown which, to me, don't seem that different.  With commercial sprawl it is easy to understand the visual differences, from 'Rural slammer' (Soledad) to 'Tank farm' (part of the port of Houston)    Though the book is primarily visual, with seventy-five well chosen aerial photos used to illustrate the categories, I thought the essay on the first ten pages was first class in explaining the reasons behind sprawl, basically the fault of those folk in Washington allowing commercial interests to favor suburban white populations and male-headed households during the last few decades. The back of the book has a useful bibliography, list of websites and index.    Jim Wark's aerial photos were used by the author to carefully explain the categories and you can see several hundred other examples of his work in 'America' (ISBN 8854400033).  If you like aerial photos have a look at Alex MacLean's book 'Designs on the Land' (ISBN 0500284148) with over four hundred stunning color photos of what is happening commercially on the ground.       Though a large number of Americans live in the sprawl environment (and by choice, too) it is worth remembering that over ninety percent of the US is still open land.  This fascinating book is a useful visual guide to how bad things can get.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-09-16

This is the sixteenth book of FSA photos devoted to a State that I've bought and I must say it is probably the best one from any criteria, photo selection, editorial content, design and printing.  Though it only has 150 photos, a close second to this title would be 'Picturing Texas' (ISBN 0876111401) which has more than 200, it makes up for less visually by having such a comprehensive editorial content.      The photos are divided into twelve sections and this being Pennsylvania there are sections covering coal and steel production. Each page has a photo with a short caption centered below and if I have a criticism it would be that the images could have been just a bit bigger.  It is the pages after the photos that make this book so interesting to me.  There is an introduction to the Times of Sorrow & Hope on-line catalog (this includes the six thousand taken in Pennsylvania) followed by two indices, one of photographers and one of places. Next, Appendix A has excellent expanded captions and technical information about the 150 photos, Appendix B is a biography of the main photographers and lastly a Resources and Selected Bibliography.  The bibliography is particularly impressive because it is so comprehensive and nicely includes books about individual photographers. I've not really commented on the actual photos, they are all extraordinary visual documents, as one would expect.      The book overall I found very impressive, the editorial and production could be a useful template for any State Historical Societies that want to publish images from the FSA files about their State, this is what your publication should aspire to.     ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-09-07

Developing that thought eventually produced this book of seventy-six black and white photos.  Most of them clearly show a bit of the windscreen or the curved framing of the side window and as a lovely little extra some have a picture in a picture thanks to the outside car mirror. <br /> <br />Look through the photos fairly quickly and it certainly does suggest a sort of car journey during the day and night and various weather conditions but when I looked through the pages slowly I felt the journey aspect started to unravel.  A bit more than a quarter of the images are either blurred or lack any formal visual focal point, 'Blizzard' on page ninety-two falls into this category, it really isn't worth a second look.  Most of the rest are very ordinary in their subject matter and it could be said that this reflects the reality of the land, mile after mile, as seen from a car.   <br /> <br />The best pictures I feel are those taken when Forsman's car was stationary, page eighteen shows part of Lead, South Dakota and page thirty-three has a stunning shot of the City of Commerce with the Denver skyline in the distance, both of these have the useful black framing of the curved side window.   <br /> <br />The design and printing of the book are excellent as one would expect from the Center For American Places but I thought 'Western Rider', though an interesting photographic idea, did not come up to the potential I would have expected. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-04

The three authors have created a brilliant parody of those travel books that always have a slightly optimistic edge to the copy despite the country they are writing about possibly being a bit of a third-rate dump. The contents follow the usual format, a brief survey of Molvanian history, geography, culture, food and drink, theatre and the arts, how to get there etc, etc and as this is Molvania there are some useful words on crime and ATMs.<br /><br />The rest of the book is devoted to a full description of the five regions with information about the main towns, hotels, where to eat and what to see. In fact just what you would expect to see in any travel guide and this is why I think the book is just stunning, it looks so convincing. The attention to detail has paid off, with little colour code squares on the edge of each page, central area street maps of each town, hotel references (with those little symbols for bed, phone, karaoke or toxic spa) the use of bold type in the text to emphasise things to see or do, color panels with Traveller's Tips, dozens of photos obviously carefully chosen to depict negative aspects of the country and at the back an index, a detailed map of Molvania and a map of the capital (Lutenblag) transport system. It just looks so real and I think it is a tribute to the authors that they have managed to keep the parody text credible to the last page.<br /><br />As is usual with travel guides the publishers have a plug for their titles, other Jetlag Travel Guides include, for instance, 'Let's Go Bongoswana' (formerly known as Belgium East Congo) 'Surviving Moustaschistan' (Central Asia's forgotten jewel, tucked between the break-away Soviet state of Kalashnikov and the former Persian province of Carpetstan) or how about 'Sailing the Syphollos Straits (another forgotten jewel near the oil-drenched capital of Port Halitosis)<br /><br />I haven't quoted any of the great stuff in this book, you can get a flavor of this by going to Molvania (via Google) to see some pages from the book but here is a useful phrase, \\"Sprufki doh craszko\\" (What is that smell?)s from the book but here is a useful phrase, \\"Sprufki doh craszko\\" (What is that smell?)	2004-08-31

The Southwest US is clearly a great place to take photos, dramatic open spaces and weather plus all those wonderful examples of the hand of man in the environment, mostly for negative reasons it must be said.  It is a pity though that Virgil Hancock just doesn't manage to do the area justice.  Of the fifty-two photos in the book so many of them seem to lack a focal point (or maybe they are just poorly cropped?) so that the book, I feel, is no more than a collection of ordinary photos.    As the area is so kind to photographers there are some images here that are just super with good compositions, cropping and color, for example, two store fronts in Las Vegas, NM (plate four) a chained tree stump on a trailer (plate thirty-five) or the Jungle bar in Phoenix, AZ (plate forty-one) there are at least another five or so but I feel they were let down by their cropping.    I can recommend these three photo books of the Southwest, Wim Wenders 'Written in the West' (ISBN 3823854690) Troy Paiva's 'Lost America' (ISBN 076031490X) with plenty of stunning night-time photos, presented unfortunately in a rather mediocre designed book and Gerd Kittel's 'Southwest USA' (ISBN 0500541213) eighty beautiful photos shown in a lovely classic photo-book format.    One final point about 'Open Range and Parking Lots' concerns the production, none of the photos have their captions with the image, you have to constantly turn to the back caption page to read them and the page numbering is just plain silly. The first printed number that appears is four, sixteen pages from the start of the book, the five photos that are on these pages are referred on the back caption page as 'N.b. Plates 1-5 appear on pages iii-xvi', predictably there are no Roman numerals on any of these sixteen pages.  As I said the numbering is just plain silly!	2004-08-30

This is the author's second bite of life in Southern California, his earlier book 'Southern California in the 50s' (ISBN 1883318491) was an exuberant looking collection of photos and graphics mixed in with the text.  I thought it was rather let down by the less than rigorous image selection.  'Southern Californialand' is a much better offering which I think captures the feel of this fascinating part of the Nation.    For a start 'Southern Californialand' only uses photos and none of them are angled like the earlier book.  The design is much more formal too, the photos are large, frequently one to a page or one to a spread, the very detailed captions and headings are not set in period typography either.      The 170 were mostly taken by amateurs but don't let that put you off, there are some great shots in these pages and Phoenix has wisely chosen a wide selection of places, for instance the Eastland Shopping Center, West Covina 1957, the Compton Drive-in 1977, Angel's Flight funicular railway 1956, kids enjoying an Easter party in Palm Springs 1953, Vine Street, Hollywood 1948, tract homes in Highland Park 1958, oil derricks at Signal Hill 1953 and the huge globe at Leisure World 1962.       As well as plenty of places and events there are many showing folks having fun in the fifties (why would an amateur take a photo of someone looking glum?) and some of these are sometimes the most interesting, a super photo on page sixty-eight shows four people having a meal, nothing clever about this at all photographically but it has a wealth of information about fashion, interior decor, furniture, utensils and the food on the table.  Pages twenty and twenty-one show a husband taken a photo of his wife sitting on a bench at an intersection, again a real amateur shot (I wonder why this photo of someone taking a photo was taken?) but it is full of detail, commercial strip architecture, their clothing, ads on the seat, and the street furniture.  So many of these photos have this kind of detail that you can pore over.      Because these are amateur photos there are a few duds but overall I thought this was a lovely book of photo nostalgia and examples of the pop architecture that commercialism in Southern California did so well.  If you lived here in mid-century this is the book to get.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-08-27

The eighty wonderful photos in this book cover sixteen years from 1934 when Morris made several trips across America.  He sought out the commonplace everywhere, though most of the photos here are from his beloved Midwest and mostly exteriors of weather-beaten buildings.  They all have a stillness about them, helped by the straightforward way Morris arranged the shots, there are no crazy angles, soft focus or wastage.<br /><br />All the photos are beautiful compositions and in the case of the buildings they are shot face on to show textured wood and the almost abstract shapes that a roof, chimney or porch creates when a shadow falls across them.  The interior photos are of rooms and close-ups, a dresser draw or a kitchen table with household bric-a-brac.  None of the pictures include people (except for 'Uncle Harry entering a barn' on page 113) and this might put some viewers off but Morris wanted to use the images and combined them with his writing in 'photo-text' books like 'The Inhabitants' (1946) or 'Home Place' (1948).<br /><br />I think this book, beautifully printed and designed, is an excellent reminder of a visual poet who was distinctly American.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-08-13

Instead I was disappointed to find it is just a collection of less than mediocre images from the photo morgue of the LA Herald Express. I don't think the publishers realised the essence of down market newspapers are the headlines and photos, the story would be written to fill the remaining space. To separate the headline from the photo really doesn't work, so each page photo in the book should have shown a small tear-out from the paper with the punchy headline and the photo.  To have one without the other produces a very dull book, which is probably why I was able to buy a copy at a really low remainder price.    There are very few photos in the book that warrant a second look taken as they were for each day's paper and not history.  Many of them have small amounts of retouching which is a bit odd as the image quality was of no interest to the readers, some have retouching that is just plain amateurish, a woman's tears on page fifty-six and a building aflame on pages 130-131.  A few show the picture cropping marks and the paint used for cut-outs.      All the photos show the ordinary folk of Los Angeles in moments of anguish, no celebrities, politicians or momentous events, the Herald left all that stuff to the more professionally produced dailies.  Comparing these photos with the ones from the New York tabloid Daily News ('New York Exposed' ISBN 0810943050 or 'New York Noir' ISBN 0847821722) shows just how parochial, ordinary and dull the Herald's output was but the title of the book is, after all, local news!	2004-08-02

Although published in 1980 I think this lovely book is still relevant in this digital age. The idea was to make a collection of visual cliches (over fifteen hundred included) and I think the authors succeed wonderfully. Each page is divided into three columns and the text is arranged alphabetically, Bullet holes, Bullfighter, Burnt paper, Bus, Bust are the words on page thirty-six. Every word has at least one graphic image, some have several, Heart has eight for instance, and they are all given a designer's credit, date, country of origin plus a few words about what the design is meant to convey. The material covers ads, packaging, magazine covers, logos, posters, brochure covers and most examples of designed printed matter.         Many of the graphics are American and mostly date from the mid-Fifties to the mid-Seventies, a period in which graphic and typographic design was unusually creative I think. Look through the index of creative folk and the regulars have plenty of showings, Saul Bass, Seymour Chwast, Lou Dorfsman, Bob Gill, George Lois, Herb Lubalin, Paul Rand (with fifty-five examples) Ben Shahn, Arnold Varga and Henry Wolf, to name just ten. The only disappointment I have is that all this wonderful material is not in color        So if you work in the visual creative biz and can't think of something use this book to kick-start your ideas.

If you are new to this movie style the first chapter, What is 'Noir'?, explains the fascination with the themes, archetypes, visual iconography and dialogue.  The other chapters expand on these main points.    I was, though, rather disappointed with this book, Alain Silver has done it before with his definitive text book 'Film Noir: An encyclopaedic reference to the American style' (ISBN 0517464675) and also with his photo book 'The Noir Style' (ISBN 0879517220) a beautiful coffee-table title with film stills and long captions revealing the essence of these great movies.      Other disappointments include a rather narrow focus on mainly ten movies, Criss Cross, Detour, Double Indemnity, Gun Crazy, In a Lonely Place, Kiss me Deadly, Out of the Past, The Reckless Moment, T-Men and Touch of Evil, which unfortunately does not include The Asphalt Jungle (OK, it's my favorite). No index, I really would expect one in this kind of book.  The production, though beautifully printed, all the text is white out of black and I find this gets tiresome eventually, especially the tiny type of the Chronology and Bibliography, not to mention that printed matt black shows up finger marks easily.

All-American Ads of the Seventies adds another 702 pages to the 3418 pages in the first four books and only the Ads of the Twenties remains to be published. This latest book is really the weakest of the set though. As editor Jim Heimann explains in his intro, the Seventies print media lacked creative sparkle because television had captured most ad dollars. He also mentions the important point that in the Sixties ad art directors copied a lot of the really great creative stuff shown in the editorial pages of magazines and into the Seventies so much of this input had become everyday. Although he doesn't mention it I think another reason so many of these ads look bland is because they are just not old enough, they have not quite gained a nostalgic or curiosity value.<br />Still there are some fascinating pages to enjoy, I liked the chapter on Consumer Products with ads for Sony Betamax, Electrophonic turntables, Advent VideoBeam television, Pioneer tape decks, Polaroid Sonar camera, Honeywell slide projector and an IBM Electronic 75 typewriter. All gone to that electronic dustbin in the sky. I thought the classiest ads were in the Business &amp; Industry chapter, some really creative photography and design.<br />If you lived through the decade you'll find some memory joggers here. As with the four previous books the production is excellent, all the ads have been carefully copied from the originals and no screen clash.	2004-07-09

The title of this intriguing chunky photo book has a word missing, it should have been '1000 ROAD SIGNS'.  Actually probably about 940 official highway signs and the rest being privately made but still relating to roads.  The three-language text for the twelve chapters (Animals, Man, Stop, Dog, Transport, Children, Miscellaneous, Danger, Weapons, Toilets, No! and Work) is on single pages and mixed into the relevant photo sections. Considering that the subject matter is rather uninspiring, visually this book looks rather good, photos are twelve, six, four or one to a page and there are plenty of spreads with one photo.<br />There are some pretty weird signs, too.  One from South Africa has an explanation mark in a triangle with three words below, 'CAUTION ROAD STOLEN', Australia has a no swearing sign, a red outline circle with a red diagonal across the body of a man, by his head there are five marks, *!#&quot;?.<br />I'm not quite sure who this book is aimed at, highway engineers and transport planners, graphic designers, or readers who go for quirky books (me) but as it was produced in conjunction with Colors Magazine (Taschen published their '1000 Extraordinary Objects ISBN 382285851X) you can be assured of something a bit different to leave on your coffee table.	2004-07-09

Here is another of those wonderful Dorling Kindersley titles that you can open at any page and be amazed.  I can't really add much more than the Editorial Synopsis above regarding the contents, except to say that this is a beautifully produced book with well thought out editorial content, large photos (mostly as cutouts with a grey drop shadow that makes them float on the page) with excellent captions. Some of the models are quite amazing, frequently using hundreds of thousands of bricks and used in the Lego theme parks.<br />There are some lovely touches throughout the pages, ten to twenty-three has a company time-line showing how Lego originated and as the years go by keeping up with new developments in technology so that now the little bricks come with chips.  Pages thirty-two to thirty-seven explain how bricks are made and to illustrate this an assembly line of Lego was constructed and photographed.  <br />Buyers of this book should know that it is not a how-to manual though, there are a few pages of things to make, including (pages seventy-one and two) a beautiful moving skeleton that looks like it has less than fifty pieces.  As the basic Lego unit is an oblong brick, curves have always been a problem and model makers who join the company have to learn how to make round things out of straight things.  I noticed that one area still defies a credible solution: lettering!  Any letters have to be made of straight lines and with capitals like A and R they end up looking the same.<br />I think, for the price, this is a wonderful book that any Lego user will enjoy.	2004-07-08

These very graphic and explicit photos of crimes against bodies come from just one city, Los Angeles and it made me think that hundreds of thousands of similar photos must be in police archives around the world. Fortunately nearly all of these were only be seen by the police, legal folk and juries.<br /><br />Katherine Dunn, who wrote the introduction, does not explain why LAPD detective Jack Huddleston kept a scrapbook of dead body photos and they are not only crime oriented, included are a few medical curiosities, plus a tattooed man, shrunken heads from Borneo and in the back of the book nine photos of the main US prisons.  I think the inclusion of the non-criminal images does weaken the books premise though, was Huddleston just a prurient collector of the odd and bizarre?<br /><br />All the photos still have their white borders and the captions, either handwritten or typed, contribute to the format and feel of Huddleston's original scrapbook.  The book's last two pages give a brief explanation of the retouching that brought out many of the details hidden in the shadows of the originals but I think the publishers should have gone that bit extra and used a finer screen than the 120 dpi and possibly a better quality paper, too.  Flick through the pages and the overall impression is of greyness, so four stars.  A book on slightly similar lines, 'Car crashes' (ISBN 3822864110) with photographs by Mell Kilpatrick (taken in the Los Angeles area for police and insurance companies) used a 200+ screen and glossy paper to make the strong images work.<br /><br />Read the other reviews and it is clear that this is a book that has, understandably, polarised readers, it is not fiction but fact and a solid visual record of the terminal damage done to the living by those who couldn't care less.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-07-03

I think you should know that this book tips the scales at sixteen pounds, is almost two inches thick and shows every field in England.     I thought the sequence of mapping pages was rather well thought out, just plain anywhere is to a 1:72,000 scale, slightly built up areas are 1:36,000 (and I can just about make out where my house is) large cities are 1:18,000 and city centres get a wonderful 1:4,500 scale so it is easy to see parked cars.    Despite the massive size and weight it is very user friendly, each aerial photomap spread has a descriptive caption and a reference to the relevant section of a cartographic map in the back of the book (1:288,000 scale) and nicely this map has marks indicating each aerial spread, with a page number, too. There is also a twenty-five page index.    This is definitely a book to get sidetracked by, find a place and pretty soon you'll spot something else and turn the page to follow a motorway or a river and then get distracted by a colorful shape and want to find out more.  I was surprised at the number of airports and airstrips everywhere, even at 1:72,000 they are easily spotted.     Part of its beauty is the printing, by a German company called Aprinta. With 175 dpi, the color on every page is perfectly registered and the excellent binding completes this amazing book.  If you have an interest in England and like maps you will not be disappointed by this unique overhead view of the nation.	2004-06-28

The American railroads sold their services using posters but had a problem deciding what should be shown.  European train posters mostly favored showing the end destination rather than the American graphic idea of showing the train.  The first few posters shown in this beautiful book are a mixture of route maps, flamboyant lettering and illustrations of trains, sometimes all on the same poster, too.    Santa Fe, to my mind, really kicked off the great railroad poster by using the talented Louis Treviso and Oscar Bryn.  They both produced knockout, straightforward graphic solutions, with bold colors and strong typography, clearly influenced by the leading European poster artists like Ludwig Hohlwein, Lucian Bernhard and the Beggarstaff Brothers.  Into the twenties Santa Fe used Sam Hyde Harris to continue the trend in strong graphics.  Southern Pacific used Maurice Logan to design equally powerful posters, page sixty-two has a stunning Logan graphic of two trains selling the Great Salt Lake.    Other artists and designers who get a good showing are Hernando Villa, who developed the memorable Indian's head for Santa Fe, Leslie Ragan for the New York Central (he has the most illustrations in the book) Sascha Maurer for the Pennsylvania Railroad and many artists who have one or two works shown.  The authors combine all these creative folk and the way their output was used by the rail and ad industries up to the Fifties.      I thought the book was very well produced, though the caption typography is rather fussy, using the rather old fashioned Fig.33 and then capital directions in brackets (FACING PAGE TOP LEFT) in every case there is enough space to put the caption below each poster.  The back of the book has a bibliography and index.    This is probably the best (and only) title about American railroad posters, some good work is shown in [[ASIN:0811817474 All Aboard!: Images from the Golden Age of Rail Travel]], by Lynn Johnson which also covers general railroad graphics.  European travel posters have had plenty of coverage and I can recommend a really super book of British work [[ASIN:1856690148 Railway Posters 1923-1947: From the Collection of the National Railway Museum, York, England]], by Beverly Cole and Richard Durack with over two hundred illustrations in a well designed book.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover,	2004-06-21

Graphic designers will love this book with its colorful comprehensive overview of cigarette containers from around the world.  There must be several hundred packs shown (and beautifully printed with each pack having a drop shadow so they look like they're floating on the page) and the authors have managed to arrange them into meaningful chapters.  The chapter dealing with 'Patriotism by the Pack' has some great designs, the Tobacco Alternatives Company issued Glory brand (1996) with a flamboyant use of the Stars and Stripes, the White House produced an elegant pack in the Eighties, a flip-top box in cream with just the President's seal on the front.    Now that smoking has lost its cache the last chapter 'The Anti-Packs' has some really offbeat stuff, Trim brand from the Cornell Drug Company in 1960 suggested on its front that it 'curbs your appetite', aimed at the ladies, naturally.  Pure brand in 1995 would have you believe that because their product contained no additives you could puff away in good health.  I'm not convinced that all the weird brands shown here were serious attempts at creating mass sales though.    Thibodeau and Martin have written a fascinating study about pack art (and the packs are the dominant items in the book) and though there are other books on the subject the only one that might be comparable is Chris Mullen's 'Cigarette Pack Art' (ISBN 0861367898 or 0312138423) which came out in 1980.  Written from a European perspective it perhaps has more historical pack material shown and a lot more text.      Oh yes, the book jacket points out that neither of the authors smoke!    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-06-18

It's nice to see a book of coffee-table proportions just devoted to cartoons, well why not?  Previous Playboy books have covered the history of the magazine, the delightful Playmates and now the cartoons.  The 450 plus illustrations are the work of 107 cartoonists and if you are a regular reader of the magazine you'll see your favorites.  Gahan Wilson has the most (thirty-two) followed by regulars like Eldon Dedini, John Demsey, Alden Erikson, Kiraz, Roy Raymonde, Doug Sneyd (he of the flamboyant signature, which I was never able to decipher until now) Erich Sokol and between these, dozens of great artists who have maybe one or two works each. The humor might not be the wonderful ironic style of the New Yorker but it is amazing how many fresh takes can be created with the bachelor lifestyle.<br /> <br />This is a handsomely produced book, printed on thick glossy paper which, nicely, allows you to really appreciate just how good some of these artists are. My favorite, Jack Davis, unfortunately only has four shown, Richard Taylor has a super picture on page ten, an art gallery where he has created several Picasso type paintings, Doug Sneyd, Phil Interlandi and Dedini are all brilliant draughtsmen and Shel Silverstein can create so much with so little line and color. <br /> <br />However I was a bit disappointed with this book, as another reviewer has commented, there is no indication of when the cartoons appeared and I wish the publishers had gone the extra mile and perhaps devoted some space throughout the pages for a photo and biography of the regulars, some of these guys have been with Playboy for years.  Someone though, at least, did have the foresight to compile an Artists index and a useful Order of appearance list, both of which are in the back pages.<BR> <br />Clearly a wonderful book for the bedside table if your date didn't turn up, try laughing  yourself to sleep.	2004-06-15

On page six of this large book, Stephen Shore writes, in the Artist's Note, \\"The book you are holding in your hands amounts to what might be called the photographic equivalent of a director's cut\\". It is in the nature of such things you now get an additional ninety-four photos with the forty-nine that were in the original 1982 Aperture edition, though this is not strictly true because some that were in the original are not in this edition.    I bought the original book because I loved the way Shore captured the everyday urban American outdoors and of course the amazing color and detail.  This new edition is even better because the photos are now larger, mostly 10.5 by 8.25 inches.  The other thing I love about some of these photos is the way Shore captures the street corner, this seems to be a favorite composition (stretching back to the famous FSA photos of the Thirties) with contemporary photographers and Photorealists painters like Richard Estes or Davis Cone.  Shore's 'El Paso Street, Texas, July 5, 1975' could just as easily be an Estes painting.  There are several corner photos in the book and they are just stunning.    Another reviewer has commented on the amount of detail in these photos, helped of course by the two hundred plus screen, the original book used a 175 dpi.  Apart from the screen it is interesting to compare images that appear in both books and the color does vary.  'Beverly Boulevard, June 21 1975' in the original (page 39) is predominately brown for the street area, in this edition (page 115) it has changed to a predominately blue cast.  I wonder if this is the sort of thing that concerns collectors of first edition photo books?    In addition to the photos in this beautifully designed and printed book there are two text pieces, the first one, by Stephen Schmidt-Wulffen, includes twelve photos from Shore's 'American Surfaces'.  The back of the book includes biographical notes and a useful bibliography.    This latest 'Uncommon Places' will bea book I'll look through for some years to come.	2004-06-14

I'll agree with him because having collected a few dozen books devoted to FSA photos it is strange to see color photos taken by the same small group of brilliant photographers who took thousands of monochrome images that defined the Nation's view of the Depression.  He also mentions the important observation that most color photos used in print media at the time were for decorative or flamboyant editorial use, in other words color for colors sake and of course color was used extensively for advertising.    With 175 photos the book starts with an FSA view of the countryside and then merges into urban, city and railroad shots and finally images of war production, mostly dealing with aircraft.  I don't think the last photos have the emotional punch of the earlier FSA work, they seem more photos of record.  Of the FSA section of the book (with sixty or so photos) there are eighteen beautiful shots by Russell Lee taken in Pie Town, New Mexico, he had already taken many photos here, which are now considered some of his greatest work.     The color film used for all the work in the book was the newly developed Kodachrome and perhaps this explains why many photos have an overdeveloped darkness but when mixed with the greens and browns of the countryside, city and factory it gives all these pictures an authentic texture.    I think this is a wonderful book of photos and the addition of color, especially to the FSA ones, reveals an intriguing new look and feel to a black and white vision of the past.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-06-13

I saw this title on the publisher's website and it seemed just my kind of book, a strong visual history/nostalgia survey of the white middle-class suburbs in the fifties.<br /><br />Now, having looked through it several times I find it rather disappointing, it is a very superficial look at the Fifties home.  Each room in the house has a chapter plus one each for: Outdoors maintenance and Backyard recreation. The chapters start with a few hundred words introduction then the following pages are ad illustrations and short bits of text that strangely don't really relate to the images on the page.  A lot of the illustrations have been cropped from ads and in many cases could have been a lot bigger than they appear.<br /><br />This publisher's books generally have colored backgrounds to the pages and in this title the background motif are colored strips, on many pages these get as much space as the illustrations which I feel is rather unnecessary, especially where an ad has been reduced too much in size and the text is not readable.<br /><br />I recently bought a similar book: [[ASIN:0867195657 Going Home to the Fifties]] which also used illustrations from ads for each room in the house.  Like 'Atomic Home' it was a rather generalised view of the times but of the two books I think it is the better one and it certainly has a lot more text, even though set in a large type face as if produced for school use.  For a better look at homes of the period I can really recommend [[ASIN:0764304585 Inspiring Interiors from Armstrong 1950s]] this has hundreds of photos of room sets, created for Armstrong Flooring ads that ran in the big consumer magazines of the period.  These rooms reflected a middle-class life style and nicely, the flooring in the photos does not overpower the rest of the room.  The other book that covers the period beautifully is [[ASIN:3822811580 All-American Ads of the 50s]] an amazing 960 pages of ads, all beautifully reproduced, and the chapter on the home (Consumer Products and Interiors) has 218 ad pages.<br /><br />'Atomic Home' is sort of a fun book but unfortunately doesn't come up to expectations so I am still waiting for the coffee-table title about life in the fifties suburbs.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.teriors) has 218 ad pages.

Divided into eighteen photographic chapters (with one image per page) it really is an impressive selection, especially as it covers his output from 1935 to 1960.      The chapter on crime has the largest selection (thirty-one) with the predictable dead and bloodied bodies surrounded by police and public.  Weegee claimed he (and several Speed Graphic cameras) covered hundreds of murders for the New York tabloids, he knew that that the only thing that mattered to the 'tabs' were the headlines and photos, the story could fill any space that was left. The other chapters cover ordinary New Yorkers in mostly nighttime settings.    The perfect complement to this book is Miles Barth's 'Weegee's World' (ISBN 0821226495) which admittedly does have many of the same photos but also has three long essays about this unique photographer.  I have another book about Weegee, a very poor reproduction of his 1945 title 'Naked City' (ISBN 0306812045) and again most of the photos are in the New York book.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-06-08

You really know when a musical genre has arrived, when a book of cover artwork is published.  Hip hop has been around for a couple of decades or more so Andrew Emery's colorful book is especially timely and can join the expanding shelf of titles devoted to great cover art.    As is usual with any book devoted to this marketing art there are plenty of the duds and forgettable designs but in the case of hip hop the very nature of the music produces some startling and vibrant graphics.  Just turn over the first few pages and by page thirteen the socko 1983 album Wild Style jumps of the page, graffiti artist Zephyr created the beautiful lettering, page sixteen has a stunning 1984 Afrika Bambaataa cover based on a Marvel comic cover.  The three hundred covers are arranged historically into ten chapters and the author writes about the various musicians and graphic artists who created so many of these covers, in particular George Dubose gets some good coverage.    I thought the chapter called Beat Biters was intriguing, as the music itself samples other sounds why not sample other covers as well, ten examples are shown including the 1991 cover from Young Black Strangers based on the 1963 'With the Beatles' album, a 1989 Tone Loc cover 'Loc'ed after Dark' was swiped from a 1963 Donald Byrd Blue Note LP designed by Reid Miles.

This a visual celebration of a great industry, which in the distant past really did help create America.  By the Forties and Fifties the railroads were a mature industry and judging by the photos so were the folks who, day after day, made it all happen.  So many of these images show middle aged men, working in a noisy, dirty environment with rugged faces but the professionalism clearly shows.  Another reason for using photos from this period is because so many jobs disappeared when steam and passengers faded away.     I thought the choice of photos was excellent, not only the well-known names, like Steinheimer or Winston Link (on pages 134-135 there is an amazing shot of his showing a Norfolk and Western locomotive being overhauled) but also many from company files that will hold your interest.  Chapter four, for instance, has some great passenger train interiors from various railroads.  Although 'Faces of Railroading' is unusual in not having the usual run-by photos I have a copy of 'Decade of the Trains: the 1940s' by Rogers E M Whitaker and Don Ball (ISBN 0821207598) which has dozens of photos showing railroaders going about their business.    Another reason I like Carl Swanson's book is because it is super to look at.  Well printed with big one to a page photos and printed in more than 200dpi, elegant design and typography (a tip of the hat to art director Kristi Ludwig) makes this book look so superior to the usual transport publisher offering.

I found this a fascinating visual record of the TVA and its work over the relevant years, 1933 to 1963.  Patricia Ezzell, the TVA's historian, has selected 135 one-per-page photographs from more than twenty thousand in the archives and they really do reflect the wide range of activities the Authority was involved in, dam and reservoir building, power generation, fertilizer production, reforestation, mapping and surveying, flood control and more.      The book is divided into three sections, Depression Era, War Effort and Growth and Change. Although social photographer Lewis Hine was hired for a month in 1933 and contributed 197 photos in that time the majority of photos in the book are by Charles Krutch.  He took thousands and it is the range of subject matter that makes the book so interesting to me.  As well as the obvious technical shots of dam construction  Krutch also photographed temporary house building for construction workers, village and small town life, recreation centers, farming and folks relaxing in their homes enjoying the benefits of cheap TVA electricity.      The photos in the last section, Growth and Change (basically from 1945 to 1963) are devoted to the everyday.  The TVA was by then established and you can see photos of transmission lines, aerial shots of large corporate plants, increased freight traffic on the Tennessee River, school visits to farms and even the contestants of the Miss Guntersville Lake Beauty Pageant.  All thanks to the vision of the Roosevelt government years earlier.    The book is well printed and designed and the author writes a brief introduction to the TVA.  The back includes a useful bibliography and index.  My only criticism is that the map on page seven is woefully inadequate, the excellent captions with each photo mention places that I wanted to find out where they were but couldn't, I ended up using the TVA's interactive map on their website.  Apart from the map this is a wonderful book about a huge endeavour thatreally made a difference to so many people.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-05-31

You might think that the humble postcard is just a piece of printed cardboard but just read John Jakle's fascinating book and discover there is a lot more behind these colorful images.  The eighty-two cards in the book, dated from 1900 to 1977, show a selective view of cities at night, as Jakle explains (in a very comprehensive introduction) the card publishers, at least in the early years of the last century, were quite happy to add a row of street lights if none existed and city fathers frequently felt pressure to then put them up.      Before the introduction of fast film most night-time postcards were day-time photographs and illustrations with a black sky added or maybe a moon with a cloudy sky painted in and street lights made to glow, some of these do look rather crude though.  New film and cameras in the thirties allowed postcard photographers to be more creative, with strobe effects for instance and the old favorite, the time-lapse.      Though most cards from the thirties onwards are photographs many were still heavily retouched to give even more sparkle to the image, page 107 shows a looking down view of San Francisco with searchlights in the background and streets of the city just dazzling with light, it was taken in 1940.  A slightly different view is of Capitol Street, Jackson, Mississippi in 1955 (page 67) here the street lights are strangely dim but the sidewalks are aglow with light from shop windows and plenty of neon, a positive reflection of the city as modern and progressive or as the author says 'Postcard views were expected to celebrate cities and do so in ways that would preserve, if not strengthen, the social status quo'.    The production and design of the book is first-class, landscape in format, to compliment the typical postcard shape, each card has a page to itself with a long caption. The back of the book has an appendix about collecting these interesting postcards and a bibliography.    Another book (also beautifully produced) of citypostcards that I have enjoyed is 'American Architecture: a vintage postcard collection' by Luc Van Malderen (ISBN 1864700785) which has 625 mainly illustrative images and includes several night-time views.  Both books will interest anyone who wants to learn more about how cities were presented to the public.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-05-26

With the 112 photos taken over several trips around America Dunas has captured a past he remembered and wanted to record permanently before it vanished.     What I liked about the book was the careful sequence of the photos, for instance from photo fifty-eight you'll see a fifties car, 59, a smiling couple sitting on their porch, 60, a man outside a building, 61, part of an auto junkyard, 62, a terrific shot of the Hotel Carlos in Yuma, Arizona.  This mixture of people, buildings, signs, autos and almost abstract parts of buildings makes for a really excellent flow of images as you turn over the pages.    For me the best photos are of buildings, they are presented in a very formal way, either front on or a perspective of two sides with the background providing a natural frame.  No need for fancy gimmicks because the image content is strong enough to create interest and meaning.  In fact nearly all the photos show Dunas has a natural framing instinct for great compositions, which make them seem so right.    I think it is worth commenting on the books production.  It is of coffee-table proportions, with excellent design and typography and printed on quality paper which all helps to make the Dunas view of America all the more vibrant and fascinating.

The latest Koolhaas and the gang book (actually a paperback) is summed up in the Editor's letter on page sixteen, part of which reads &quot;Content is a follow-up to 'SMLXL', an inventory of seven years of OMA's tireless labor. In many ways it is structured according to what its predecessor is not-dense, cheap, disposable&quot;.<br />The 546 pages are a textual and visual pot-pourri of articles, mostly architecturally related with several general interest items thrown in, like the one about Martha Stewart and her views on eastern lifestyles, or 'Red Radio', the story of the Cold War fight for Africa's airwaves (no, really) and if you get frustrated trying to read some of the tiny type that inevitably gets used in this type of book you can look at a few ads that are scattered throughout the pages.<br />I bought the book for its strong visual interest (it is mostly visual) and the seventy-six articles are presented in all sorts of graphic ways, from the nearly unreadable 'Junk Space' which stretches over ten pages of text in one continuous paragraph to the rather fascinating 'Yes/No' using a clever collage technique to explain the rise and fall of the global economy. The pace is unrelenting with colorful whiz-bang graphics and photos from pages one to 546.<br />Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the penultimate one devoted to the work of OMA-AMO since the publication of 'SMLXL', unfortunately the huge amount of information is presented in nearly unreadable paragraphs over twenty-seven pages. To quote the Editor's Letter again &quot;Content is, beyond all, a tribute to what are perhaps OMA-AMO's greatest virtues - its courage, its dogged, almost existential pursuit of discomfort, its commitment to engage the world by inviting itself to places where it has no authority, places where it doesn't 'belong'&quot;. I'll certainly drink to that!	2004-05-08

It covers images from 1900 to 1970 and basically concentrates on faces but the surrounding Japanese typography and graphics are also included from the original printed source.<br />Author Alex Gross writes in the introduction that the use of women in print took off in the Taisho period (1912 to 1926) and it became common to see smiling beauties used to sell products.  By the sixties, as in the West, glamour was a standard ingredient to promote anything but because of many years of American forces occupation advertising and marketing developed a sort of hybrid East West beauty.<br />As is usual with the Icon series there are no captions to the dozens of pictures so you'll just have to guess what faces belong to ads, posters, packaging or magazine covers but it is clear looking through the pages to see the changes from a traditional looking Japanese beauty (the hairstyle is a giveaway) to a more modern looking miss.<br />This all-color little paperback will interest designers and pop culture fans.	2004-04-26

The four areas she covers are lesbian, bisexual, transgender and gay with each chapter having the relevant book covers (150 in all) nicely placed so they are near the appropriate text.  <br />She covers the two sides of the pulp fiction market, the big mainstream publishers, who issued literature in a mass market format and so had to present Tennessee Williams, Gore Vidal, Somerset Maugham, Truman Capote, Radclyffe Hall, James Baldwin and others with suggestive images (the predictable shapely female with the half unbuttoned blouse) and come-on cover lines to generate sales, I bet they would have loved to change the titles to something more racy though.  The other side was the very cheaply produced (but expensively priced) paperback that had no literary pretence and was produced for the 'one hand reader'.  Plenty of these latter covers are shown and the designs are as predictable as the words inside but when you see them presented, sometimes four to a page, their overwhelming blandness becomes fascinating, however there are some that look as if a designer has been able to produce something creative with art and typography.  <br />So many of the lowbrow and no-brow paperbacks are parodies of the genre, 'Hot Pants Homo' by Percy Fenster, 'The Man They Called My Wife' by Stark Cole' or 'Take My Tool' by Vivian LeMans, all with the appropriate tacky graphics and blurbs.  Overall an interesting book (and well designed, too) about a slice of pop culture publishing that sold copies in the millions.  Another book, also well designed, covering the same subject is Jaye Zimet's 'Strange Sisters' (ISBN 0140284028) with two hundred covers of lesbian pulp fiction. Both books will be appreciated by graphic designers and pop culture fans.	2004-04-18

I got this wonderful book in 1992 and I've recently re-read it and I still think it is the best survey of magazine design.  Magazines (and newspapers) are rather unique in their design because the words and the visuals are so tightly connected.  Other areas of print design can be taught in design schools but to adequately cover publication design schools would have to employ sub-editors and other wordsmiths, not a very practical solution!  Bill Owen's book is not a how-to manual but a good solid history in words and thankfully plenty of covers and spreads.    This design history starts in the early years of the last century but to my mind the story really comes alive in America during the Thirties and Forties.  Great titles like Fortune, Harper's Bazaar, Glamour, Vanity Fair and others had publishers who realised the importance of strong visuals and having a good Art Editor.  During the Fifties and Sixties a whole raft of talent was creating stunning looking magazines.  My favorites were Otto Storch on McCalls (the things he could do with Baskerville Old Face were just amazing) Herb Lubalin and his rather short run on the Saturday Evening Post in 1961 and Willi Fleckhaus on Twen (a stunning looking German monthly that made a design virtue of black pages and a condensed typeface called Schmalfette Grotesk. A German book devoted to this very influential title is [[ASIN:3781403920 Twen: Revision einer Legende (German Edition)]], I've uploaded some spreads from the book.    The text has plenty of spreads (in color) and in the latter part of the book the pages are filled with these and long captions. The survey ends about the late Eighties so it does not cover a lot of the contemporary US and European publications.  Editorial design in so many of these, it seems to me, is a bit of a free-for-all because it is so easy create something using the latest software.      If you are interested in the history of magazine design over the last few decades Owen's book is the one toget.  A book that covers the history of one corner of the magazine business, the weekly news titles, that I found fascinating is [[ASIN:388243791X Kiosk. A History of Photojournalism]] and I particularly liked it because it has hundreds of spreads, rather than just individual photos, from the great weeklies like Life, Stern, Paris Match, Picture Post and others.    +++I've done a Listmania 'A few books about magazines: covers and contents' which covers other books.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-04-18

A worthwhile (and inexpensive) introduction to one of the world's great buildings.  There is some text by John Berman but it is essentially a pictorial book with just over a hundred photos that fortunately have quite detailed captions.  The majority of these have been seen before but I've never seen the two on page seventy-nine showing the GoodYear dirigible Columbia attempting to pick up mailbags from the mooring mast.  Perhaps the less said about that idea the better!  <br />There are thirty-six photos showing the construction, mostly taken by famous reportage photographer Lewis Hine and a better showing of his photos can be seen in 'The Empire State Building' by Freddy Langer (ISBN 3791324918)  The other main photo coverage is of the B-25 bomber that crashed in the building on July 28 1945.  The rest of the photos show some interiors, visitors to the observation deck and a selection of the ESB during night and day, including the inevitable one of a lightning strike.<br />Perhaps the most intriguing item is on page twenty-six, it shows a page from a typewritten record of the construction by Starrett Brothers and Eken.  There are seventy-seven of these pages and photos which were rediscovered in the mid-nineties and reproduced in 'Building The Empire State' by Carol Willis (ISBN 0393730301) a fascinating celebration of this stunning skyscraper.	2004-04-13

Jonathan Doherty, in the introduction to this book, says &quot;Hine looked at workingmen with his camera and found a strength in them and a pride in their work that was common to all&quot;.  He had a point because the photos show men controlling their machines and not the other way round, with these photos you can see craftsmen at work.<br />The sixty-nine excellent photos in the book (originally published in 1932) show forty-six taken during the construction of the Empire State Building and they are clearly not posed.  Hine was given the assignment to cover the building work and so the photos have the raw energy of heavy work.  The remaining twenty-three photos are much more formal studies of activity, lathe operators, engine drivers, coalminers, turbine engine grinders, welders and others are all creatively shown going about their work.  I think these beautiful photos really show the respect Hine had for the working craftsmen.<br />Good (and inexpensive) as the book is I wish these photos could have been presented in a more formal setting, centred on each page with quality paper and printing to really do them justice.	2004-04-11

A tip of the hat to Lou Brooks for making this book such a delight to look at!  The subject matter is pretty mundane and in the hands of many other book designers 'Skate Crazy' would just look bland but Mr Brooks knows his stuff.  He knows how to select the right photos, handle color panels, overlap graphic images, choose a relevant typeface for headings and all the other little design elements that make each page sparkle and this book has 144 of them in a neat square format.    Although much of the material is similar Brooks has managed to split it into sixteen chapters and write a bit about each subject but the book is essentially visual.  The four hundred rink stickers are the main pictorial items and nicely the index in the back is a geographical listing of past rinks across America.  Strangely, despite a thorough coverage there are no close-up photos of skates, a page or two from a manufacturer's sales  brochure would have been helpful I think.    'Skate Crazy' is a wonderful bit of nostalgia and if you rolled (or danced) around one of the three thousand rinks across the Nation in the Forties or Fifties you'll really enjoy looking at this book.

US	43058502	R2ROOP8FV7ZAXY	0813916801	155924480	Trailers	Books	3	11	11	N	N	Fixed mobiles.	This should have been a neat little book with the simple task of revealing trailer folk in words and images but I thought that many of Carol Burch-Brown's photos didn't quite work, either the compositions were too bland (page twenty-seven) or they were too tight on the subject. Not helped either by being printed in a 133 screen so they all have a very grey look and lack contrast. Another omission is a lack of captioning, just who is the teenager (page thirty-nine) sitting in a chair next to an elderly lady in bed, is she his mother, relative, neighbor? Who is the happy mom (page ninety) holding a baby, is it hers, her sister's, a friend's? I would class these photos as reportage rather than arty images and as such they cry out for some sort of explanation.    The text by David Rigsbee is partly autobiographical, partly observational but fully meandering and obscure. A couple of examples:  From page thirty-eight: 'By virtue of its sheer lack of substance, a trailer speaks eloquently to circumstance. And this in turn reflects a just apportioning of its powers of evocation and harmony with its mortal inhabitants, for the rawly circumstantial looms forever just around the corner.'   Or, from page forty-one:   'The trailer is the transformer box that redoubles this dotted trail and prefigures the logic of its interchange with the outside world. It is also the power box of a dream space: its defined enclosure induces something like the captive's fantasy that the mind to which it has access is as large as the world, to which it does not have access.'     So, I'm still looking for a photographic book about this little corner of American life. 'Trailers' is a start but I think trailer folk deserve better.	2004-03-22

This art satisfied no existing tastes, fulfilled no existing social demands.  It was produced in the relatively firm conviction that people would come to like it when they became better people, less decadent and less corrupted by bourgeois values than they were at present'.  Well, as we all know now, such fanciful notions eventually ended up in the wheelie bin of history<br />The book examines the presentation of the visual arts in the Soviet Union in ten essays but the writing is very academic,  not helped I thought, because the English text has been translated from German. These essays (and artists biographies, chronology and bibliography) form the bulk of the book rather than color reproductions that I would have expected, there are only eighty-four of these in the main display section.  The poster section though does have a wonderful showing of thirty-eight examples, fortunately not dominated by Lissitsky or Rodchenko, they only get one each.  <br />Boris Groys is right to say that no one really liked this art, the paintings seem uniformly dull and uninspiring and I suppose this was only to be expected when the output of art was almost exclusively controlled by the Union of Soviet Artists.  They decided who was in favor or out and I expect they would have been shocked to see the ironic visual language used in the paintings of Komar and Melamid, the leaders of the Sots Art movement in the sixties and seventies.<br />This will probably be the standard reference book explaining Soviet art, despite the small number of works shown (and why no index?) and is completely different to a similar book on communist creativity, 'Chinese Propaganda Posters' (ISBN 3822826197) by Michael Wolf.  A huge coffee-table book of three hundredcolorful posters portraying the bright future for the folks in Mao's China.	2004-03-11

The sixty-five photographs in this book are probably the best of the thousand Lewis Hine took during the construction of the Empire State Building.  Several are now the standard image used to depict industrial output during the Depression and rightly so.  Hine concentrates on the workers rather than the actual building and you can see just how precarious some of their activity is.  Years before hardhats and workman's comp hundreds of seasoned craftsmen managed to erect a building nearly a quarter of a mile high in 410 days and weighing 365,000 tons.<br />Author Freddy Langer writes an interesting short essay about Lewis Hine explaining how he became interested in using photography to expose the exploitation of child labor during the early years of the last century.  These photos were used in his book 'Kids at Work' (ISBN 0395797268).  His interest in photographing the workplace got him the commission to record the building of the Empire State and some of these images also appeared in his 1932 book 'Men at Work' (ISBN 0486234754).<br />It is a shame that the book does not give more explanation to what the craftsmen are doing in the photos. A book that does have photos (though not by Hine) and detailed captions is 'Building the Empire State' (ISBN 0393730301) edited by Carol White, it reproduces seventy-seven pages of typewritten description, some of it quite technical, that someone at Starrett Brothers, the builders, produced as a record of the construction. <br />The Empire State was in competition with the Chrysler Building and a book by David Stravitz, 'The Chrysler Building' (ISBN 1568983549) is a week-by-week photographic construction record of Van Allen's Art Deco masterpiece with detailed captions to the pictures. Strangely many of Hine's photos clearly show the Chrysler Building in the background.<br />All three books celebrate the building of two stunning New York skyscrapers.	2004-03-01

Slowly they will crumble (or be vandalised) and eventually just be a pile of wood, plaster and rusty metal of the kitchen appliances.  Oddly, the weather preserves and destroys these poignant remains, the scorching summer sun preserves but once the elements get inside, the wind, rain and heavy snowfalls gradually weaken the structure and the less well made will eventually collapse.    The seventy photos are all interiors, mostly homes but also schools and amazingly a bar in Gascoyne, North Dakota.  The first was taken in 1991 and the latest 2001, one of these, a bedroom in Grassy Butte, North Dakota, only recently abandoned but looks like it could still be occupied because the elements and creatures haven't taken over yet.  Many of these homes seem to have been vandalised, nature is clearly not so untidy as humans.  Several reveal building techniques, with their floorboards and plasterwork ripped away.  Strangely many of these left homes still contain the personal effects of the folks who lived in them.    Fitch wisely concentrates on the interesting interiors, making his photos a record as well as interesting compositions.  Most other photographers tend to capture abandonment in relation to the wider landscape, capturing hard edge man-made decay resting in the natural softness of the outside.  Another book I recently reviewed, the excellent [[ASIN:1904332080 Ghosts in the Wilderness: Abandoned America]]  by Tony and Eva Worobiec, covers the same theme but their book had as many exterior landscape photos as interiors.      Both books are full of stunning photographs (the Worobiec's is definitely the coffee table one) that capture a part of America that deserves recording before it slowly vanishes.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-02-23

As another reviewer has said, don't expect a full technical account of the background to these beautiful houses but if you want excellent exterior and interior photos in a well designed and printed book, 'Modernism reborn' is the one to get.<br /><br />The fact that these thirty-five houses have all been restored in some way gives the book extra interest. Many of them were featured in the architectural press years ago when they were first built and these are the photos you usually see in books. Some of them were neglected but fortunately the current owners thought restoration worthwhile and this is how Roger Straus photographed them.<br /><br />An interesting companion book to 'Modernism reborn' is [[ASIN:0684867443 Classic Modern: Midcentury Modern At Home]] by Deborah K Dietsch, not directly concerned with the architecture but more to do with the furniture, fabrics, lighting and style that made these houses such wonderful homes.

It is basically encyclopaedic in nature but the editors decided to split it into the following chapters: Streamline Modern; Biomorphic modern; Modern historicism; Postwar modernism; Modern pattern and ornament; Expressionist modern and finally Beyond Modern. Many of the artists mentioned, of course, easily drop into one or more of these periods.  For example, Finnish designer Timo Sarpaneva's work is featured three times, vases from 1950 and 1953 and a 1955 glass decanter, each is pictured and  described in detail with additional related information and at the back of the book is his biography.  I really feel it would have been more appropriate to have each artist's work and bio in one place and the essays, defining the various styles, together at the front of the book.    I was impressed, though by the range of the artists and designers covered in this survey, not just the fine arts of Miro and Dali but also the graphics of Herbert Matter and Milton Glaser and even the creative contributions of companies like Herman Miller and Polaroid.  The authors have rightly considered all aspects of mid-century creativity.    The scope of the book is North American and Europe but if you want to concentrate on America have a look at the two volume, 'The American Century: Art and Culture' [[ASIN:0393047237 The American Century: Art and Culture 1900-1950]] and [[ASIN:0393048152 The American Century: Art and Culture, 1950-2000]] by Barbara Haskell and Lisa Phillips.

These are great images of the abandoned railroad and they work so well because you don't really realise that the track is way above street level and now overgrown with all manner of greenery.  These photos perhaps give an eerie impression of what Manhattan might look like some months after all the people left.    Apart from the excellent twenty-four photos I found this book very disappointing, there is the usual annoyance of having all the captions on one page at the back of the book.   Plenty of room is available to center them under each photo.  There are two essays: one by John Stilgoe I found very tedious, Adam Gopnick's was more interesting as it directly concerned the High Line, its history and possible future.  Both essays take up twenty-two pages, almost as much as the photo section and this after all is a photo book.    BTW you can see all of the photos on the High Line web site, had I known that I would not have bought the book!    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-02-03

I first be came aware of the work of Karl Gerstner while at art college in the late Fifties. I bought a copy of his first book 'Cold Art?', written in German, so I couldn't read it but I could follow the excellent analytical diagrams explaining the basis of mathematical abstracts as produced by Piet Mondrian, Josef Albers, Max Bill, Richard P Lohse, Gerstner and others. Thirteen pages of 'Cold Art' and spreads from his other books are also shown in this beautiful book of Gerstner's career.     His creative work from the fifties and sixties always used the typeface Akzidenz Grotesk (Standard Medium in English speaking countries) for text and headlines, despite, as he says, there being no italic. To make this type more complete he redesigned it as Gerstner Program and his work on this and another of his faces, IBM Original is explained in detail in the book.     His books, publication design, typefaces, logos, ads, packaging and thoughts on design and related areas of creativity are well presented throughout the book. I especially liked the last few pages which have some examples of his amazing computer generated art (in spreads from the Swiss magazine Basler Magazin) and this is why I find Gerstner so interesting, his graphic work covers such a wide area and interestingly, in the book, he also provides an intellectual underpinning of his creativity.     BTW the same publisher has produced a book devoted to Gerstner's paintings, graphics and computer art (ISBN 3775791515).    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-02-03

With 2500 logos, mostly eight to a page, well printed on good paper this book should have been a treasure.  Instead with no obvious editorial input it ends up being frustrating.  As far as I can see it is arranged by design studio output.  It should have been arranged, I think, by style of logo, typographic, flat graphic, illustrative etc.  The captions don't do the reader any favors either.  Client and designer are listed but no dates or what sort of company the logo is for.  This book seems very typical of David Carter's output, I have a copy of his 1988 'Logos of America's Largest Corporations', six hundred (nicely printed) marks with just the company name and city location, no designer names or dates.<br />As to the logos, with 2500 of them there has to be a lot of duds but that is only to be expected.  The majority of them have been produced for small companies who feel they need some mark for local recognition and on this basis there are many neat solutions here.  For example page 234 shows a capital D incorporating a fork and spoon, a clever idea and surely just what Dantes Restaurants Inc wanted.  If the book was just going to show real clever stuff produced by super creative designer folk it would be pretty thin.  For the money though I feel this is good value.<br />At the other extreme a logo book that I have enjoyed is Per Mollerup's 'Marks of Excellence' (ISBN 0714838381) a history of logos, beautifully designed and printed and here the logos are grouped according to their  look, eyes, flags, globes, hearts etc. A brilliant survey.	2004-02-03

Abe Goodman's Humorama titles solved the problem.  These were cheaply-printed digest size magazines full of bad jokes, cheesecake photos and girlie cartoons.  The author Alex Chun says Ward produced thirty cartoons a month for Humorama titles and over twenty-fives years probably drew an amazing 9,000 pin-ups.<br /><br />Ward's Humorama art was probably the only reason anyone bought these tacky publications.  Because he had to produce so much work quickly he developed his own unique style of using Conte crayon to draw pin-ups.  This had the advantage of showing tonal quality almost like an airbrush and when the originals (up to eighteen by twenty-four inches) were reduced to the digest size pages they looked impressively slick.<br /><br />There are 117 whole page Ward pin-ups, all from his Humorama period, in this book. The majority are printed in four-color sepia with white highlights (the front of the book has an essay and examples of his early comic and color pin-up work) and the sexually suggestive, exaggerated females with their black stockings, filmy negligees, skin-tight dresses, coiffure hair and impossibly high stilettos leap of the page.  If you are interested in this little corner of American male pop culture I doubt there will be a better book of Bill Ward's voluptuous art.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-01-21

With about three thousand entries in the index this surely must be the definitive visual volume of what food looks like.  The twelve chapters cover it all, for instance, Baking Goods and Additives include sprinkles and sparkling cachous, Berries include twelve types of bramble and Tea has twenty-seven types, each shown in a white saucer.    Apart from the comprehensiveness the reason I love this book is the way it looks.  Each spread has an overall still-life color photo (shot from above) with the relevant foods carefully positioned and lit to show what they look like, short captions are overprinted on the clear space between items.  The pages are uncluttered by design elements, the paper is glossy, the printing first-class, I must say that to see food presented in this way is quite stunning.  The ultimate coffee-table book of grub.    * If you are an illustrator or artist this book will be the only one you'll need for reference.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-01-17

It's a big jump from the lively paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec of prostitutes in Montmarte to Timothy Hursley's interesting coverage of America's only legal sex industry and the one big difference you'll notice is the understandable absence of people in the photos, consequently they offer a rather detached view of this very human activity.    The photos date from the mid-eighties to today so several of the buildings are no more.  The five chapters geographically cover Nevada and Hursley seems to have visited most of the State's sex industry.  He has tried to cover everything, the wire fenced entrances, parlours, bedrooms, recreation areas, kitchens and the rubbish bins outback. Several kitchen photos show cooking timers, used for obvious reasons. The Shamrock went to the trouble of making a custom unit to house their fourteen timers.  The exterior shots suggest that these brothels are rather isolated (parking would never be a problem) though the Chicken Ranch, in 1986, thoughtfully provided a runway, shown on page forty-three.     Overall an interesting book of photos, good color and well designed.  As a visual record of this particular area of American life Tim Hursley will probably retain his monopoly.  I doubt anyone will do it better and just the book, in the bookcase, to sit next to Barbara Heyl's 'The Madam as Entrepreneur: Career Management in House Prostitution' (ISBN 087855211)    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2004-01-03

I've always been interested in the commercial presentation of the fat man and this book is the seventh in my collection.  One of my favorites is 'Dream of Santa' (ISBN 0517186551) which has thirty-three excellent reproductions of Haddon Sundblom's Santa painted over the years for Coca-Cola, another interesting book covers all the marketing variations the company used, ('Coca-Cola Collectible Santas' ISBN 1887432930) other titles cover advertising collectibles.    Vicky Howard's book is in a class of its own though.  It is a joy to look at because attention to detail has paid off, from the lovely jacket, with its gold embossed title, endpapers, elegant typography throughout the ninety-six pages, to the paper and printing and with the many delightful pre-1920 pictures of Santa, all combine to make the perfect book.  Many similar pictures appear in 'Postcards from Santa Claus' (ISBN 075700105X) but this is a more straightforward historical survey and lacks the seasonal magic of Howard's book.    If you have young children I feel that 'The Book of Santa Claus' is just the right title to bring out each December and let them discover Santa again, as the years pass and the pages get more thumbed it could end up as a family heirloom.  When they are grown up this wonderful little book will revive happy memories of the Christmas season.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-12-31

Fortunately for a lot of photographers abandoned man-made America seems to be just about everywhere and what a visual treat it produces.  This handsome, large (check out the dimensions in the Product Details above) book of photos is a cut above the usual offering though.  Rather than shoot the predictable broken and rusty commercialism everywhere the Worobiec's had the great idea of capturing one particular area of the Nation, the northwest.  Here the railroads were the catalyst to opening up the landscape with towns created about every ten miles or so to service track and train.  Predictably many of these settlements lacked natural resources and decent farmland so it was inevitable that the weather, depression, and technical advances in transport made so many of these towns uneconomic and many folk just left.     What I find amazing is the nature of the leaving.  Many photos show inside abandoned houses still with kitchen units, phones, furniture and personal effects. Page sixty-five shows a wall calendar for July 1959 in a house in Wildrose, Nebraska and as the caption explains these were useful indicators to reveal the date of the owner's departure. Sometimes the Worobiec's found small schools abandoned, as the photo on page 117 shows, the floor awash with textbooks.  As expected there are many photos of abandoned vehicles (possibly thirty-six was just a bit too many) surrounded by vegetation, rich pickings nowadays for collectors, I bet.    Another reason why I like this book is because 'Ghosts in the Wilderness' is not just a collection of photos but a travelogue as well, six chapters have lively and interesting essays about the social and economic aspects of the area.  These words give more meaning to the poignancy of the images.      The printing and design is excellent, the photos are mostly one to a page with generous white, black and light grey backgrounds.  I do have a criticism of the production though, the last five pages show all the photos as thumbnails with the relevant technical details, all this information could easily have been accommodated on the page with the photo and so avoid having to keep turning to the back.    I think the Worobiec's have done a wonderful job producing a book of regional photography.  Oh yes, thank you Mark and Sarah who gave me this lovely book as a Christmas present.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-12-30

The fifty-one black and white photos in this nicely designed book will not be to everybody's taste.  The photos could not be more stark and minimalist, mostly eye level, straight on, images of almost plain walls of commercial premises in Irvine, Los Angeles.  The only concession is (photo twenty-two) a close-up of an open two-switch electrical box, I bet Baltz only took this because the box cover was off and the inside looked interesting.<br /><br />Looking through the photos at the shapes and rigid right angles of the walls, doors, guttering and windows suggest abstract paintings and I can well understand that the appearance of the book encouraged the significant 1975 photo exhibition, 'New Topographics'. Some of the ten photographers (including Baltz) in that show have gone on to exhibit and publish books about the man-altered landscape. I think this particular photographic genre is now well established, thanks to Baltz.  An excellent book: [[ASIN:386521827X New Topographics]], is a comprehensive look at this exhibition.<br /><br />The book is as minimalist as the photos, apart from the simple captions there is no essay about Baltz (at least not in my German produced copy which does not have a photo on the cover) no page numbers, nothing on the inside flaps or back of the cover.  I would have preferred this 2001 edition to have some reference to the influence these photos had over the last twenty-five years.  An equally minimalist designed book I have enjoyed is [[ASIN:B0026QB3TS Meadowlands]]  by Ray Mortenson here the photos are of an  industrial area in New Jersey.  The photos are not as rigid as those by Baltz and frequently show how the natural landscape has been changed by heavy industry.<br /><br />Both books present a vibrant photographic style and I like them because they show how visually fascinating the man-made environment can be.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-12-21

Originally published in 1991 I bet many of the structures that David Graham photographed along the Nation's highways are no more.  In fact this book could well have run into volume two, three or four, there just seems so much interesting stuff to photograph before it gets pulled down.  Most of the eighty-one excellent color photos show some quirky aspect of the American scene including some old favorites that pop up regularly in similar books, these three are in California, the Cabazon dinosaurs, the bulldozer shaped building in Turlock and Randy's Donuts in Inglewood.<br /><br />All the photos have captions which mostly explain the location and circumstance though the intriguing house (page fifty-two) on stilts with a half-track vehicle in front only gets 'Vienna, Virginia, 1986'. California seems a place where vernacular buildings and signage flourish and Jim Heimann's 'California Crazy' (ISBN 0811830187) has dozens of photos of past and present roadside fun and the new edition includes plenty from the rest of the country, too.  Had it been build earlier, I'm sure David Graham would have visited Newark, Ohio, to photograph the head office of the Longaberger basket company, a 160 times larger than life basket, with two handles reaching into the sky, only in America!<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-12-21

This is the second Chronicle box of printed ephemera I have and it suffers from the same problems as the first, 'The World War II Collection' (ISBN 081183431X) namely the reluctance of the publisher's to go the extra mile and make the contents look as authentic as possible.  Of the twenty items included nine of them should have been line and tone combines for best results.    There are some interesting items though, the one I like best is the 1962 mini poster for an Andy show at the Los Angeles Ferus Gallery, showing a Campbell's soup can and printed on thick paper with a deckle edged bottom, it is good enough to frame.  The three postcards showing the original source material for the paintings, Female Movie Star Composite (1962) Self Portrait (1964) and Flowers (1967) are good examples of the visual input that Warhol used to create his unique work.  There are three letters included, one from MOMA in 1956 rejects Andy's offer of his drawing Shoe, it was signed by Alfred Barr.  I wonder if he regretted, in later years, turning down this gift?  Another, a letter from Mick Jagger in 1969, discusses the Stones album Sticky Fingers which Andy designed and Jagger ends one paragraph with \\"...please write back saying how much money you would like\\".    Apart from the less than authentic look to some of the items this is an interesting box of Warhol 'stuff', a thirty-two page booklet explains each item.  Also included is a pass (good to December 31 2005) to The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.  BTW Included is a self-inking stamp of a cow's head with the words Factory Edition, be careful with this as it will most likely leak, as mine did but it didn't cause any damage to the other items.	2003-12-19

I was intrigued when I first saw this pop up on Amazon while looking for another book about the Fifties and I placed an order.  Now having read and looked through it a more apt title would be 'Going Home to the White Middle Class Suburban Fifties'.  The author covers the period with a rather narrow focus, concentrating mainly on home life in the newly built suburbs and the reason for this is because nearly all the interesting illustrations (paintings and photos) are images taken from ads of the time.  There are chapters about The Living Room, In the Kitchen, The Bed and Bath, Watching Television, all areas where pictures from ads would be available but no chapter, for instance, about suburban shopping, supermarkets and malls were not heavy advertisers in mass-market magazines back then.  It does seem odd to allow the availability of ad images to dictate the contents of a book about the recent past.     This does create some odd situations, page thirty-seven shows a Saturday Little League game with an Oldsmobile taking most of the space, page forty has a painting to show a village theater but it is dominated by a 1957 Oldsmobile, on pages forty-one and forty-two the five-day-a-week trek to collect commuter hubby from the train station uses a painting with six Chevrolets taking more space than the train.    The author covers the period in a straightforward way and I get the impression that it is the pictures that count rather than the words (set in a rather large type size) which just fill out the space between the two, three or four pictures on each spread.  The captions are redundant as they only describe what can be seen in the pictures.  There is a good index but no bibliography.    'Going Home to the Fifties does capture some of the feel of this wonderful period for the white middle classes and it was a neat idea to use the very images that helped to create this feeling but I think another book does a better job, the stunning 'All-American Ads: 50s' by Jim Heimann, 960 pages of color ads including many that had the pictures used in Bill Yenne's book but now you can see and read the whole ad.    *I've done two Listmanias on the 50s with over fifty books, especially visual ones.       ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click on 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-12-16

I knew that there were books of his work available over the years but I had not bothered with them because I thought they were too specific in their subject matter. With this gorgeous book, which has just over 330 color pictures (in more than 200 dpi) beautiful printed and designed and in a large size edition it's just what I've been waiting for.      After his early appearance in Playboy an art critic at the time, Frank Getlein, said in the magazine: \\"All of this is painted in what looks at first like a very slapdash manner.  It's anything but that.  At ten feet, everything falls into flawless perspective\\".  The apparent casualness of Neiman's style is quite fascinating, it does look so easy yet within the paintings very precise detail is achieved using dazzling colors and careful brushstrokes.  In 'Toots Shor Bar' (1969) you can see the names of many famous brands within the kaleidoscope of color, 'Manhattan' (1998) reveals famous buildings with the merest touch of the brush, 'Vladimir Horowitz' (1968) looks like Mr Horowitz despite having his face made up of at least twelve flat colors.    In Richard Brilliant's short essay Neiman is discussed and nicely there are some drawings: a 1956 crayon sketch of some nudes to a 1985 felt-pen on paper drawing of Red Skelton, to show what a great draftsman he is but I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't some sort of description of Neiman's brush technique and color usage included in the essay.  Brilliant also raises the interesting point that art critics and historians have not paid serious attention to Neiman (or for that matter Norman Rockwell) both artists are skilled technically and popular, I put this down to the subject matter both explored, Neiman paints sports events, celebrities and wealthy folk having fun while Rockwell covered middle America.  Just not Fine Art it seems.  (Incidentally you can read a short, very succinct explanation of the 'fine art' scene by New York gallery owner Louis Meisel on page fifteen of his book 'Photorealism since 1980').    If, like me, you are a fan of LeRoy Neiman you will enjoy this gorgeous coffee-table book, a beautiful survey of a colorful American artist.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click on 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-12-14

The work of Otto Storch on McCall's, Lou Dorfsman at CBS and naturally the typography of Herb Lubalin was a strong influence on my work as a publication designer.    The author writes about the development of Modernism in Europe and how it spread to the US with the arrival of many European graphic designers escaping the oppression in Europe during the Thirties. In America they found a receptive country open to new ways of designing for print, which flowered, with the explosion of creativity in the Fifties and Sixties. On page 179 there is a list of many great designers, whose work is the basis of this book, who have died and Remington rightly says that their absence denies emerging young designers creative role models.    The design of the book is first-class (a tip of the hat to Brad Yendle) the images are well selected with a good mix of posters, advertisements, corporate graphics, magazine covers and logos. I would have preferred to see more magazine spreads and at least one example of the amazing 'Upper & Lower Case' publication. All the illustrations have good long explanatory captions.     If you are involved with commercial graphic design and want to learn about its history in America this book can't be beat. I mentioned earlier two designers whose work I love and the following two books are well worth searching out, 'Dorfsman & CBS' by Dick Hess and Marion Muller, 'Herb Lubalin' by Gertrude Snyder and Alan Peckolick. The book that really got me interested in expressive typography and I still think is valid in this digital age is 'Typography' by Aaron Burns, published in 1961.     ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-12-12

Not quite the usual collection of photos capturing US Interstates, most other photographers always include a few images of abandoned buildings and mechanical detritus along the way and perhaps this is why I was rather disappointed with this book. Andrew Cross focuses rather narrowly on the actual road in many of the sixty-six photos (a possible coffee-table book for highway engineers) and ignores the potential of seeing highways in various weather conditions and at different times of the day other than daytime. I think the two books by Jeff Brouws: [[ASIN:1556706049 Highway: America's Endless Dream]]  and [[ASIN:0811836770 Readymades: American Roadside Artifacts]] present a much more exciting view of people, places and things along American's concrete ribbons.  Many of the photos in Cross' book seem rather unimaginatively cropped, either too much sky or too much grass in the foreground, this unfortunately pulls the eye away from interesting parts, a cluster of fast food signs for instance, or some other visually saturated part of a photo. Three photos of a factory, surrounded by a huge parking lot (located at I-75, Exit 69/SR 40, Florida) look very dull and perhaps should have been left out.   The books production was also disappointing, on the (un-numbered) 128 pages there are only sixty-six photos (eleven spreads had two photos) I really can't see a reason for leaving so many blank left-hand pages. I found 'Along Some American Highways' very bland, unfortunate because this area of American commonplace can produce vibrant, powerful imagery.	2003-12-11

A really super book for the price. This is a paperback reprint of a book published in America in 1940. Each house has one or more photos, inside and out, plus a plan (some a bit too small) and details about what the owners wanted, site, cost, materials, exterior and interior details etc. The black and white photos are good considering they have been taken from a printed source.    The authors describe the concept of modern architecture in the short introduction and in the back each architect writes about their views on design.  I must have looked through this book dozens ot times and I still love these houses.  Unfortunately I bet a lot of them are no longer standing, which makes this reprint even more important as a visual record.    If you are interested in this type of streamline building have a look at 'The Modern House Today' by Nick Dawe and Kenneth Powell, this has excellent color photos of sixty-three houses in England that are still standing, unfortunately the book is let down by the minimalist design. Charlotte and Peter Fiell's massive 576 page reference book '30s and 40s Decorative Art' covers Moderne houses (mostly in the US and Europe) with photos of interiors, ceramics, textiles and lighting.

In the last chapter of this fascinating book author Val Williams says of Parr 'He is a cunning photographer, sidling his way into situations where he shouldn't always be, looking as ordinary as the people he photographs'.  How true and this could well explain how he manages to take such interesting photos of people and situations.<br />This thick, chunky book gives a good cross selection of Parr's work, from the superbly observed black and whites of working class life in the seventies and eighties to the capturing, in color, of the middle classes in the nineties.  I think Parr works best when he photographs the British and is able to see and capture social situations that most of us miss.  There are twelve color shots of street scenes in Boring, Oregon, (chosen, naturally, because of the town's name and Parr's three books, called Boring Postcards though these have no connection with the place) and they are just like any other photographers vernacular work, if Boring had been in England Parr would have found some class differences to make the photos say plenty.<br />Author Williams writes in depth about Martin Parr and his work and with several hundred photos this book is an excellent visual biography of one of the best British documentary photographers working today.  BTW, the back of the book includes a few pages of  Martin's collection of ephemera, knick-knackery that has taken his fancy, a tin of Heinz Barbie pasta shapes, a set of Russian coasters showing trucks or a set of Spice Girls chip packets and more, I have a similar collection of things that have caught my eye over the years, is this a trait of creative folk?	2003-12-01

Michael Wolf collected the hundreds of posters shown in this sumptuous book and it occurred to me while looking through the pages that the originals have probably been seen by more people than any others in the world.  They were stuck up in every public place (including homes) and published in magazines.  Predictably many of them show Chairman Mao, the Great Leader, Teacher, Helmsman, Commander urging the masses forward with the wise fertiliser of his thoughts.  To reinforce greatness artists were not allowed to paint figures above his head.      The posters are organised according to the thirty-three chapters in Mao's Little Red Book.  Chapter twenty-three, Investigation and Study, has some interesting images including an 1981 painting of various jet aircraft and one from 1978 showing two open hands encasing a stylised atomic graphic. Not all Chinese posters just show peasants looking to the future.    I was surprised to see some quite creative painting styles, for instance, Chao Deren has a brush stroke style similar to the best of the European movie poster artists, Deng Xiu and Zhang Ruiheng could easily have been doing fiction illustrations in the American consumer magazines of the fifties and sixties.  Perhaps the strangest poster paintings are those of babies and children, the faces are all rather plump and adult looking, as if the artists imagined this was how a baby Mao looked    This large 320 page book is beautifully designed and printed and if you are interested in political posters or colorful graphics you'll enjoy it.  BTW, Taschen have been rather naughty by replacing the head of a child, in one poster, with a head icon they use as a competition promotion.  It doesn't spoil the book for me but I thought it rather unnecessary.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-11-27

The publisher's trade catalog for this book says 'The only thing better than one boring building is hundreds of them' and the photographer Clive Piercy says of his images 'This is not a book about architecture-or photography.  It is a visual poem, a love letter and a simple attempt to help preserve these fantastic, quirky characters'.  Well, maybe and this chunky little book delivers 480 photos of them.  Piercy was struck by the LA apartment that has the design characteristic of having an open to the street ground floor parking space the width of the building.      Flicking through the pages you get the impression that maybe the local builders have formed a cartel to make sure their efforts look as identical as possible, so to add a little bit of individual flavor to their apartments many owners have fixed large numbers or names to the buildings (set in appropriate typestyles:  Atomic Bold Italic or Googie Casual Cursive) Piercy photographed many examples of this building detail and being a designer I found these fascinating. A thing I found rather disappointing though, was that nearly all the photos are in black and white and the reproduction makes them look rather grey (I wonder if they were originally transparencies?) so to break up this greyness color graphic elements are scattered through the pages, mostly type dingbats, how appropriate!       Piercy is not the only photographer to celebrate the 'Pretty Vacant' style, Jeff Brouws in his lovely book of color photos, [[ASIN:0811836770 Readymades: American Roadside Artifacts]] has a chapter devoted to ticky tacky homes in Daly City, California, especially interesting because he sought out homes that were painted in bright colors.  Lewis Baltz photographed pretty vacant commercial units in his famous [[ASIN:0963078569 The New Industrial Parks Near Irvine, California]].      I bet a copy of 'Pretty Vacant' will be popping up on the coffee tables of architects, designers and those interested in pop Americana.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-11-25

Endearing classics like the rural mailbox, Duracell batteries or a Stanley knife are simple solutions that stay with us decade after decade.  The Zippo company did branch out in Sixties with a new line in table lighters, it was not a success.    This is a typical company history book (produced with their blessing) so don't expected any deep insight.  The authors zip through the decades with anecdotes and factoids mixed in with plenty of photos, illustrations, period ads and dozens of pictures of lighters. The design of the book is the main reason I bought it.  Strangely, for a conveniently small product, many of the lighters shown are either larger or smaller than the real thing, I would have thought it sensible to keep them all life size.      The company recognises that collectors buy more than thirty percent of sales and they capitalize on this by bringing out annual collections plus specials for any event that seems appropriate.  A useful eight pages near the back of the book covers dating your Zippo, with photos of the bottom of the lighter which has a simple coding system.    If you are a collector of this world famous lighter this nice looking little book would be worth buying though I can't see the reason for the hefty  price.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-11-24

This stunning book originally came out in 1991 and it really should be reprinted. It celebrates 250 years of the American magazine though the focus is clearly on the last eighty years or so and essentially consumer titles that belong to the Magazine Publishers of America and the American Society of Magazine Editors. The sixteen chapters cover the editorial aspects of magazines: fiction, news, women's titles, graphics rather than the more commercial areas: subscriptions, printing, distribution but advertising does get a chapter to itself.  An interesting chapter shows in photos how the editorial folk do their job.    Visually the book is a joy to look at thanks to designer Beth Crowell. There are over five hundred images, this includes hundreds of covers and spreads, and a neat touch is using a fifth color: grey, for the many pages that have pictorial sections. The paper, typography and printing all contribute to this being just right.    If you work in magazine publishing or want a record of what publications looked like in past decades you'll enjoy this beautiful book. Another out-of-print book that is worth looking out for is [[ASIN:0847813851 Modern Magazine Design]] by William Owen, beautifully produced though it is not a 'how to' book on design but a contemporary history of European and American publications.  The 340 illustrations concentrate on spreads rather than covers.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-11-22

Basically there are too many tourist brochure photos rather than the printed ephemera I have found in other paperbacks in this excellent series.<br />Still, there is some interesting material, the intro essay by W R  Wilkerson, the eight photos looking east and west along Fremont Street over the decades, the photos of the amazing neon signs, thanks to the leading Vegas sign maker, the Young Electric Company and the chapter dealing with gambling images.  <br />For Vegas fans I can recommend an inexpensive hardback, 'Las Vegas: Then and Now' (ISBN 1571458530) by Su Kim Chung, 138 photos taken over the decades with the newer ones taken from the same place as the originals, the changes are amazing. Also worth a look is 'Faulous Las Vegas in the 50s' (ISBN 188331805x) by Fred Basten and Charles Phoenix, plenty of photos and graphic material presented in a book with a design as flamboyant as the place itself.	2003-11-18

The 20th Century Limited comes alive in this fascinating book and I guess Karl Zimmermann has now written the definitive story.  Well researched and fortunately not overloaded with too much technical detail that spoils some other railroad books.  I'm interested in anything streamline and chapter four, 'Henry Dreyfuss' Elegant Streamliner' explains how he created this railroad icon, not just the stunning engine shrouding but the livery, interior car design, tableware, printed graphics, in fact everything throughout the train to the final logo plate on the back observation car.  Needless to say the train was a hit from day one but would it have been if Dreyfuss had not been involved and the New York Central staff, who clearly knew how to run a railroad, created the new train, probably not.<br /><br />Visually there is plenty of lovely period graphic material to look at, ads, menus, renderings of the car interiors designed by Dreyfuss, timetables and brochure covers.  As usual with historical railroad books I find that the photo selection is not as rigorous as it should be, predictably, several here could be left out because they are not sharp enough or have a soft focus, the layout also is rather pedestrian, with photos butting into each other, inefficient cropping and a lack of a thin keyline round the photos to stop white sky merging with the whiteness of the paper.  A pity because I would have expected the elegance of the train to be reflected in the presentation, rather than just look like another bland railroad book.  A bibliography would have been useful, too.<br /><br />The 20th Century Limited was the classiest of the great streamliners and a wonderful example of creative styling for which America has become rightly famous.  Karl Zimmermann's text will help you relive the experience.<br /><br />FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-11-18

I don't see it like that, rather a visual history in two chapters, of twenty-eight leading consumer magazines from Europe and the USA.  The first chapter covers the twenty-eight titles with a good choice of covers and text explaining the history of each one.  Playboy and Esquire mix it with Fortune (eleven super designed covers) Stern and Punch for instance.    The second chapter called Trends is the one that I think readers will find the most interesting.  It looks at styles and techniques of cover design and finally at people on the front page.  Some of these covers could be considered historical as they feature politicians like Churchill, Stalin, Hitler and Charles De Gaulle, or celebrities like Marlene Dietrich, Brigitte Bardot, Marilyn Monroe (shown on a spread with forty-eight) or Sophia Loren.    Magazine folk will enjoy this well designed book because of all the covers.  I can recommend another book, 'Cover Story' (ISBN 0811808165) which has two hundred American titles from 1900 to 1950 in a beautifully designed paperback.  Perhaps the definitive book on the subject is the sumptuous 'Great Magazine Covers of the World' by Patricia Frantz Kery, out of print but worth looking for because it has five hundred covers from twenty countries, in a word, stunning.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-11-15

The production is quite simple, each spread has one big picture (plenty of pages have an other smaller image, too) and an extended caption.  It is the large images that I particularly liked, so you have a chance to really see the essence of the style.  There are no chapters as such but it starts with architecture, then paintings, sculpture and commercial graphics, furniture, ceramics and finally object d'art.  Most of the images are of European Deco (especially French) the US is only really covered by New York and Miami architecture.  If you want to find some books about American Deco see my Listmania on Art Deco and on Streamline.<br />For an inexpensive hardback, with 120 pictures in color I thought this was a bargain.	2003-11-14

The listing is alphabetical with the magazine title, publisher and prices relating to the life of the title.  This arrangement makes for some odd visual surprises Jungle Stories (1954) is facing Kimball's Dairy Farmer (1917) or Everbody's Poultry Magazine (1916) facing Exciting Detective (1940).      The color covers are a bit of an extra for a book that is really a listing but you get a chance to see how publishers presented their newsstand wares over the last hundred years or so.  All type covers from the nineteenth century change into illustrations in the first half of the twentieth century and finally into photographic covers that we see today.     How accurate the prices are I can't say but apart from first issues most titles seem to be very reasonable.  So if you are going magazine hunting in shops or car-boot sales it would be useful to take this paperback as a guide before you haggle.    If you like looking at magazine covers check out these two titles, ' Front Page: Covers of the Twentieth Century' by Stephanie Duperray and Raphaele Vidaling, or the sumptuous 'Great Magazine Covers of the World' by Partica Kery, both books have hundreds of colored covers arranged in meaningful chapters and finally 'Cover Story' by Steven Heller and Loise Fili, a beautifully designed paperback showing two hundred American magazine covers from 1900 thru 1950.	2003-11-14
US	43058502	R1EZ0CRI0509TM	0922915814	729664094	It's a Man's World: Men's Adventure Magazines, The Postwar Pulps	Books	5	36	39	N	N	Raw emotions and the armpit slicks	Who would expect to see such a lavish all-color book about this down-market corner of American publishing, not me but I'm interested in visual popular culture and `It's a Man's World' is really quite a fascinating study of these `slicks', produced from 1950 to 1970. They were edited by a small group of men who put out over six thousand issues of about a hundred and thirty titles. The leading publishers, Magazine Management went bust in 1975 and this particular male market slid predictably into soft porn.     The book rightly concentrates on the garish, dazzling covers, fortunately they all retain the logos and unbelievable cover lines and there are hundreds to pore over. Each cover (many shown life size) has a caption with the publishing date and where known, the artist's name. Leading illustrators like Mort Kunstler, Norm Eastman and Norman Saunders have a magnificent showing through all the pages. These covers were the USP of this particular market, a few of the magazines inside pages are shown and it seems clear to me that most of the editorial budgets were spent on the cover art. No matter what the title, it would sell better if some female, who always seemed unable to do up all the buttons on her blouse, was in a distressing situation just about to be rescued by a nearby white hunk.    One chapter, The Sadistic Burlesque, covers the titles that are most sought after today. The paintings show sadistic extremes, mostly by Nazis or Commies, yet they were displayed on newsstands across the nation to be bought by any male. Perhaps for obvious reasons many of these covers have no artist credit. The cover lines are equally suggestive, the February 1963 issue of `Men Today' promised `Brides of agony in the cave of horror', `Soft maidens for the monster devil fish' and `Love captive of Castro's execution squad harlots'. Needless to say all the `true' articles in these magazines were made up.    I found `It's a Man's World' covered the post war pulps in  detail and certainly worth getting if you are curious about popular art and culture but also have a look at [[ASIN:3822825174 Men's Adventure Magazines]] this is a super chunky book with over a thousand covers in color and because of this I think it is much better than 'It's a Man's World'.  Now that these titles are (fortunately) gone men can read about themselves in [[ASIN:1575440849 The Von Hoffmann Bros.' Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness]] and I doubt that the male authors of this book would be seen dead reading the `armpit slicks', they would be too busy being real men.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-11-12

First off I think you should know that this wonderful book's 768 pages weigh a bit over ten pounds. It is a reprint of three very popular Collectors Press 20th Century series, Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy.  I bought this copy because I'm interested in visual popular culture and I was very impressed with the historical scope of the subject matter, the 1300 colored illustrations include not only book jackets but covers of magazines, comics and nicely, film posters.      With so many illustrations you can search out your favorites, I like the work of Hannes Bok, Kelly Freas and Jeff Jones and there plenty of examples of their work.  Running through all the images the three authors contribute a popular history of each genre but it is the huge collection of covers that make this a knockout book for me.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.

As you would expected the mechanical detritus of America is a bit of a magnet for photographers.  Who can pass up taking shots of abandoned vehicles, filling stations and other commercial buildings that seem to be scattered along the tarmac of the Nation, especially if they are surrounded by an empty landscape.  Not Troy Paiva for sure but he takes the idea a step further by capturing all this stuff after dark and he does a super job.    Not content with taking these photos at night he adds a neat touch by using different colored lights to illuminate the scene.  So now the ordinary abandoned filling station becomes the extraordinary abandoned station with red walls, green and purple canopies against a dark blue sky (Ludlow on Route 66, page forty-seven) or part of a pick-up truck with a magenta cab leaning against a junked interstate highway sign (Sacramento, page 110)  The four chapters in the book are full of these intriguing photos.  The best ones, I think, are in Salvage where you can see some knockout images of old jet planes, slowly being cut up for scrap.    As well as great photos, Troy Paiva writes interesting captions to all the photos, rather unusual for a photo book, so many photographers seem to think that just the name of the location and the year is all that is required.  He also contributes four worthwhile essays to each chapter filling out the historical detail of what is now discarded.    So why *** stars?  It's because the book's production really does not do justice to these photos.  The publisher mostly produce transport books not art books and the layout would be fine if it was dealing with trains, for instance, where the photos and artwork would come from a variety of sources.  I feel `Lost America' deserves a more formal treatment, with each page having one centered image and caption and the text not mixed up with the photos.  Also there is far too much white space, none of the photos are whole page or on black pages for a change of pace.  IfPaiva carries on taking his night shots perhaps another publisher will produce a book that shows of his work to better effect.    BTW: You can see all these photos (on a handsome black screen) and more on Troy's website, just put his name into Google.  Here's a bit of advice though, don't click on his LINKS unless you have a few hours to spare, it is the most awesome list of visual Americana sites you'll find anywhere. All free too!	2003-10-29

The large size format (almost twelve inches square) means that the many whole page covers are just a bit shorter than life size, others are four to a page. The reproduction is excellent.    Plenty of these covers use the original movie poster illustrations, done by such greats as illustrator Bob Peak or designer Saul Bass.  Ace cartoonist Jack Davis has seven covers including his most famous, for the 1963 movie \\"It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world\\".  Strangely many great illustrations used on the poster or LP cover have no artist credits.  Perhaps more than any other type of record cover sound tracks used a wider range of graphics and design and this certainly comes across looking through these colorful pages.      There are probably more than twenty of these large size paperbacks devoted to LP cover art published over the last few years and this sound track edition is worth adding to your collection.    +++LOOK INSIDE THE BOOK by clicking 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-10-28

The first thing you'll notice about this book is the shape, just over twelve inches wide by six and a half deep, just the right landscape size to show very long freight trains.  This is not really a book for train fans though, photographers like the brilliant Greg McDonnell, Gary Benson or Gary Dolzall have produced much better train imagery but Andrew Cross uses freights to say something about the American landscape, the German photographer Lothar Baumgarten approached the subject in much the same way in his excellent book 'Carbon'    Most of the photos have part of a train in them, some are just of tracks in the country or suburbia.  The seven sections cover southern California, Texas, Appalachia, Northeast, Midwest, Northwest and finally central California.  I think the best photos are the ones taken in the west with an empty prairie where you can see six (or sometimes ten) diesels pulling a mile and a half long consist, either boxcars, trailer-on-flat-cars or monster unit coal trains.  The section on central California is interesting because Cross shows the area around Tehachapi Loop (but unfortunately not the Loop itself, where freights circle and go over themselves) and the trains seem to merge into the landscape, even the eye dazzling Santa Fe's or the yellow Union Pacific diesels.  Overall an interesting collection of photos that support the photographer's point that freight trains are an everyday part of the American scene.      The production of the book is worth commenting on, the shape is fine but the typography is rather quirky, the page numbers are presented as four numerals, 0084 or 0140 and the first page of the seven sections has the number filling the whole left hand page, the captions use arrows to show which photos they apply to even when the photo is on the next page.  All this is a bit of designer whimsy and not really necessary in my view.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-10-28

I think the work of Hajime Sorayama is unique in the world of erotic graphic artists so I was very pleased to get this book.  There are several drawbacks though, the book is not the complete works, being a perfect-bound thick paperback it's not possible to open it fully (without breaking the binding) the paper is fairly course but it does support the 150 dpi the images are printed in, there are no page numbers and no dates on any of the artwork but despite all that it is still a fantastic book.<br />To be able to see hundreds of examples of sexy robots, pin-ups and some really super examples of Sorayama's advertising work in this thick paperback will have to do until the definitive coffee-table book gets published.  BTW if you are in a bookshop you can't miss it because it has an incredibly seductive, highly glossy cover mosaic showing details from thirty-one Sorayama paintings.	2003-10-09

They pictured New York in the 1920s and 30s and in particular one hundred and fifty showed the day by day construction of the Chrysler Building.  Over a hundred of them are reproduced in this stunning book.  Taken by commercial photographers Peyser &amp; Patzig, most likely as a record for the contractor Fred Ley, they show the building as a hole in the ground on November nine 1929 to the completion of the annex in January nine 1931.<br />There is something about pre-war photos, perhaps the chemicals used on glass plates or the type of paper used for the black and white prints but whatever, old photos seem to have a richness of texture that enhances their appearance and you certainly notice this in these pictures.  As well as their quality (don't forget this was straightforward commercial photo assignment) there is plenty to see of the building construction, what is going on in the surrounding streets and several panoramas of mid-town Manhattan taken from the Chrysler Building, including a dramatic four-page gatefold.  <br />This is the sort of detail you'll see, pages eight and nine show the empty building site (taken on November nine) and traffic on three sides, turn the page to see a photo (November seventeen) showing dozens of male spectators looking down on the building site, now full of working construction equipment, traffic and a newsstand has appeared on a corner, by December one this newsstand has become a hut and incorporated into the fencing that now runs round the site.  After the exterior, the cameraman went inside to capture the lovely deco detailing.<br />In the back of the book there are thumbnails and captions for the photos.  Page 154 has five floor plans (I was rather disappointed that there were not more diagrams showing the exterior decorative work) and you realise that the building is not oblong, the non-street end has a chamfered side. Just one ofthe many insights that you'll get from this fascinating photo study of one of the world's great landmarks.	2003-10-05

This excellent book covers (from 1943 thru 1957) a section of the pin-up calendar genre, the Artist's Sketchpad.   The calendar publishers of the day hit on the bright idea of having additional sketches and paintings surrounding the main pin-up image.  This had the added advantage of not requiring the artists to think of humorous situations in which to place the `girl next door'.  Leader of the pack, Gill Elvgren, didn't do sketch pad calendars, he could always think up some credible situation to show a gorgeous female with a raised skirt, he does have some paintings included though.    The book wisely shows each complete calendar page, so you can see the names and addresses of the companies that bought these give-aways by the million (those were the days when phone numbers had a bit of character, like MUrray Hill 2-4090, DEarborn 2-1935 or HYacinth 7-3595). Each monthly chapter has, on average, thirty-two pictures displayed on light colored pages and some pages have displays of those terrible four-line poems that seemed to be a requirement of any respectable girlie calendar.    The introduction mentions ten artists who painted most of the pin-ups shown but the book has a major omission in that none of the pictures are credited.  Artists like Moran, Munson, Elliot, Mac Pherson or Elvgren have signatures you can recognise on the paintings but I think it would have been helpful if the all the names were printed by each picture.  However, here's an idea, get a copy of the stunning `Great American Pin-up' (ISBN 3-8228-1701-5) and spend a pleasant hour or so using the nine hundred pictures (by sixty-one artists) to identify all the paintings in `Calendar Girl'.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-09-28

I would expect the world's leading daily newspaper to produce a pretty decent style guide and I was not disappointed with this edition.  Having always worked in the design side of publishing, where it is necessary to be much more familiar with words and language than other areas of print design, I've collected a few style guides over the years.  This manual and the one from The Economist I have found the most interesting.    The New York Times book offers clarity and sensibly an alphabetical solution to the contents so that you can look up, for instance, elements of punctuation individually rather than have them all grouped under Punctuation.  The manual takes a whole page to explain the use of hyphens and intriguingly uses this example 'Use the suspensive hyphen rather than repeat the second part of a modifier, in cases like this: On successive days there  were three-, five- and nine-inch snowfalls'  Quite correct but not very elegant I thought.  It is this attention to detail and the thoroughness of the manual that impressed me.    I think it is worth mentioning here a rather unique style guide by Keith Waterhouse (author of 'Billy Liar) called 'Waterhouse on newspaper style'. I frequently get this out because it such a joy to read. Originally produced for journalists on the Daily Mirror (in the past the leading British tabloid) it is alphabetical but concerned with style more than anything, part of the contents might give you a feel of the subject matter, Adjectives, Alliteration, And now, The asthmatic comma, Captions, Catchwords, Cliches (standard), Cliches (trade), Compression, Consequences, Crossheads, Dead letters, Dots and dashes.  It was published in the UK by Viking in 1989 and is well worth searching out.	2003-09-28

The new winged transport was a prominent design element and the end location, if any, was hardly mentioned.  Now, with air travel so commonplace and lots of airlines using the same jet (thanks Boeing and Airbus) the destination is the selling point.  Geza Szurovy has selected some fascinating examples of the genre for his book.    Page eleven shows the first airline poster, the 1914 St  Petersburg to Tampa route, in a tiny Benoist flying boat, that amazingly only carried one passenger.  The venture lasted three months.  Of the 170 posters shown there's plenty of choice to nominate your favorites, I like the ones that feature cut-aways of the aircraft and also the beautiful stylised airbrush rendering of New York that TWA used for their Transcontinental Boeing 307 poster from 1940, on page fifty-eight.       Presented in a book these posters create their own interest but I don't think many of them would have won any design awards.  The typography and graphics, mostly paintings, just reflect what the airlines marketing department wanted.  However ignore the type and look at the artwork and you'll see some wonderful illustrations from Cassandre, Jean Carlu, McKnight Kauffer, David Klein and Stan Galli and one from ace cartoonist Jack Davis, for Icelandic Air.    This is a large size all-color book but I was disappointed by the bland presentation, all the posters are butted into a light grey top-to-bottom panel on each page and even more annoying, on many pages, someone had the silly idea of adding small black and white photos of the planes that appear in the posters.  This addition makes the depth of many posters smaller than they need be and the little photo, frequently showing plenty of detail, is just wasted.  Fortunately this design treatment does not apply to every page.    If you are interested in the graphics of the airline business have a look at the beautifully designed 'En Route' by Lynn Johnson and Michael O'Leary, this concentrates on airline luggage label art and shows some super examples from airlines featured in 'The Art of the Airways'.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-09-22

Architectural photographer Carla Breeze has focussed her camera on the best seventy-five Art Deco buildings across the Nation and produced a glorious book of color photos that perfectly captures the style.  I really liked this book because she concentrates on the architectural detail of each building (with  450 photos) and in many cases, when this detail is on the outside, it is just not viewable from the ground.      The introduction has an interesting eighteen-page photo section dealing with materials: metal, concrete, terra cotta, mosaic, glass, wood and stone. I found this very useful when looking at the images.  Each building starts on the spread (though some have more pages) with a street address and some background text and captions for the photos.  The elegant layout does not interfere with the wonderful buildings (a tip of the hat to book designer Robert Wiser).  Could anyone take a better photo of the stunning Niagara Mohawk Power headquarters in Syracuse on page seventy-three, I doubt it.     To complement this lovely book have a look at [[ASIN:0525934421 Rediscovering Art Deco USA: A Nationwide Tour of Architectural Delights]] by Barbara Capitman, Michael Kinerk and Dennis Wilhelm, a methodical nationwide survey, though it concentrates on commercial buildings rather than houses.  If you are Deco spotting on the road leave a space in the glove compartment for David Gebhard's excellent [[ASIN:0471143863 The National Trust Guide to Art Deco in America (Preservation Press)]] if it's not in this book then most likely it's not worth looking at.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-09-19

For instance, the few text pages have a line space between the paragraphs and also an indentation on the first line of each par, the bibliography is set in the same weight of type so punctuation is required, this can nearly be eliminated by using various weights of type to separate the different elements, the twenty-two page index could have been less if it was set in three columns instead of two.<br />However this is an important book and the symbol content rightly deserves five stars.  Henry Dreyfuss started work on this project in the fifties while working for an oil-drilling equipment manufacturer, who wanted some way of communicating with workers in parts of the world where English was uncommon.  Two-dimensional illustrations were developed and Dreyfuss slowly expanded the scope of the idea into this book, which presents several thousand in twenty-six categories.<br />The selection is very comprehensive, pages ninety and ninety-one include hobo signs with one for Cowards Will Give, To Get Rid Of You, or Free Telephone, which looks remarkably like a profile of a turkey.  A fascinating four pages show Olympic symbols from the Games of 1948, 64, 68 and 72.  I think 1968 are clearly the best, the designer avoided using stylised human forms and presented basic sport elements in a black rounded corner box.  Throughout the book, where there is space, Dreyfuss has added sidebars on a variety of topics relating to symbol origins and usage.<br />To make this book as practical as possible the contents page is in eighteen languages, a good example of why Henry Dreyfuss, apart from being a great industrial designer, was also a person who never lost his humanity.	2003-09-14

This book of spot-on political posters really seems to have polarised reviewers so it must be doing something right.  Of the two hundred that Micah Wright has produced (you can see them all on his website, antiwarposters) forty have been selected to go with some very relevant text from the Center for Constitutional Rights.  <br />I think these remixed posters work so well because the author has taken the trouble to put his headlines in the same typography as the originals (which are reproduced in the back of the book) and to see historical graphics blended with a contemporary political point really hits you between the eyes.  The surprising thing to me is that this simple, brilliant design idea has not been done before but maybe it was the events of the last two years that galvanised one person to put his point-of-view across with such deadly accuracy.	2003-09-13

An interesting overview of a minor Southern California architect who saw an opening in the market for inexpensive streamline homes.  The author examines eight of these buildings in detail and when I saw the black and white photos it is obvious that Kesling had the good sense not to make them as simple or austere as the houses designed by Schindler, Neutra, Breuer, Keck and the other big names of thirties architecture.  Houses designed by this elite group always ending up costing plenty.    Apart from the eight houses covered (which all have ridiculously small floor plans in the book) David Gebhard writes an excellent introduction about Moderne/Streamline design. There are plenty of exterior and interior photos and the author provides an interesting chronology of projects that Kesling was involved with from 1935 thru 1948.    I love any Streamline houses and a book I have always enjoyed is [[ASIN:0486259277 Classic Modern Homes of the Thirties: 64 Designs by Neutra, Gropius, Breuer, Stone and Others (Modern House in America)]] by James and Katherine Ford, a reprint of a 1940 book with 194 photos and 128 floor plans.

A super little paperback explaining nineteen fascinating photos.  Some are so famous that millions must have seen them, like `Spanish Loyalist' by Robert Capa or perhaps not so famous, yet, like Joel-Witkins `Un Santo Oscuro'.  Author Koetzle tells an interesting story about each one and he's done his research too, for instance mentioning the controversial removal of a thumb by Dorothea Lange from her `Migrant Mother' photo.      The nineteen photos are shown as spreads or whole page and other photos from the same shoot are also included.  As they were all seen in a printed form the author has added a nice touch, a small reproduction of the original book or magazine that they appeared in.  When I saw the reproductions I was reminded of Andrew Roth's [[ASIN:0967077443 Book of 101 Books, The: Seminal Photographic Books of the Twentieth Century]] a book entirely composed of covers and spreads from great photobooks.    If you want to know the background to some great photos it's worth getting this beautifully designed and printed book and at a bargain price too.

A sumptuous coffee-table book of this exuberant art style and I think it could well become the standard book on the subject.  The forty essays are divided into four sections, Sources and Iconography, 1925 Paris Exhibition, Spread of Deco and finally Deco World, and I liked the way, especially in Sources and Iconography, that the authors explain how various art styles were moulded into deco art which culminated in the very influential 1925 Paris show.<br /><br />I thought the last two sections were a fascinating coverage of how Art Deco spread around the world, mainly as architecture and fashion, though in Europe also as a fine art style. In North America, it influenced a huge range of commercial products.  Perhaps this was the only art form that was truly democratic in that it was available (as streamlining) to be seen or bought on any Main Street across the Nation.<br /><br />The design and printing are excellent.  Many of the photos, especially color, are presented whole page, the rest are all well sized, and they all have captions.  The back of the book has a very comprehensive bibliography, fortunately listed as relating to each chapter rather than just an alphabetical list, the index is divided into two, Names and Subject.  I was very impressed with this attention to detail and with the excellent text, images and production surely `Art Deco 1910-1939' will be read for many years to come.<br /><br />***FOR A LOOK INSIDE click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-09-07

One reason I love this book is the simple presentation, book designers, when confronted with colorful graphic images such as postcards, always seem to want to present them angled and overlapping each other.  Fortunately, designer Kurt Wahlner keeps them upright and puts a drop-shadow on two sides of each card, a simple elegant solution.  The color of the cards is very true to the originals.  Author, Rod Kennedy, writes just enough historical detail into the captions to keep me interested.  The chapter on the homes of the stars I found the most fascinating.  Predictably, with money no object, so many of these houses are a fantasy of architectural styles and I suppose this only confirms that most Hollywood folk had no taste.      I have another book of postcards covering the same subject, Jim Heimann's 'Hooray for Hollywood' (ISBN 0877013012) equally as good though some of the pictures are in black and white. I would have preferred it if both these books included some information about publishers of these postcards, I guess most of those shown are from the Curt Teich company.  Both books have an index and useful bibliography.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-08-25

He always delivered too. This reprint of his 1945 book captures the energy of the Big Apple and yet there are no shots of skyscrapers. Instead the (mostly) ordinary folk of the city are shown getting on with their lives and deaths.      Many of the photos are taken at night, a Weegee trademark. Inside buildings he used infrared film so he could shoot in near blackness and capture his subjects displaying emotions they would hide, had they known a camera was about. Out on the street he captured the latest human tragedy in stark close-up with a blinding flash of his Speed Graphic camera.    The contents of this book are an amazing selection of photos but I was very disappointed by the reproduction, so only three stars. As far as I can tell, the photos have been scanned from the 1945 book rather than from original prints. The paper is coarse which doesn't help the reproduction either. This looks not much better than a book of photocopies. Far better I think to go for Miles Barth's [[ASIN:0821226495 Weegee's World]]. Although it does not have every photo from 'Naked City', the 250 included are printed as duotones on glossy paper, I particularly like this book because it shows many photos as original un-cropped prints. For instance, in his famous photo, 'The Critic' the three bystanders to the left of the two socialites are usually cropped out but here you can see how great the original was. This book also has three excellent essays about Weegee and his influence on other photographers in the Forties.     Another choice might be [[ASIN:3823854712 Weegee's New York Photographs, 1935-1960]] with 335 photos from 1935 to 1960 and like the Barth book it is large size and beautifully printed (the photos are duotones) on glossy paper and could possibly have all the photos in Naked City.	2003-08-11

This the third book I have bought of Alex MacLean's stunning aerial photographs of the American landscape.  The other two, `Look at the Land' (1993) and `Across the American Landscape' (1996) were lovely to look at but this latest book with 430 photos is excellent.<br /><br />MacLean captures the changing American scene beautifully and in pin sharp detail.  Unfortunately, none of the photos are dated and many of them appeared in both his earlier books so some of them could be ten years old.  The various chapters cover America from above though the concentration is on the man-made environment, including such delights as parking, city grid, pollution, sprawl, abandonment and more.  These might seem dreary objects to photograph but MacLean can make a half-full parking lot look exciting and in many cases, when seen from above, so many of these images have a definite abstract art look about them.  The agriculture photos, of huge fields stretching into the horizon, must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Comprehensive though the coverage is there is one area of the landscape MacLean has not been able to cover, the huge amount of land controlled by the military.  Some of their activities would make fascinating photos.<br /><br />You might get the impression looking through the pages that open land in the US is fast disappearing but the reality is that the hand of man affects less than ten percent of the nation, the remainder is just open country.<br /><br />Get this fascinating book if you want to see what the American landscape looks like from a view that most of us will never normally see.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click on 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-08-09

The twenty-four facsimile items cover a very broad landscape: a poster for a very obscure 1941 movie, 'After Mein Kampf' to a fascinating first page of President Roosevelt's draft speech of his December 8, 1941 war message to the Nation, showing where he replaced 'world history' with 'infamy'. You can click the box by the title to see a photo of the contents.    Some of the items really make you think, for instance, the February 1, 1941 memo from Jules James, Chief of Naval Operations to the Commander of the Pacific Fleet stating that the Peruvian Minister had told one of James's staff that Japan intended a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.  This was just one of many rumors that were circulating in the military at the time.  Or the POW postcard, courtesy of the Imperial Japanese Army, from Frank Dunlap to his ma saying (with various word options to underline) where he is and how he feels.  Having stated that he is well, he survived his internment.    All the items are explained with a nicely designed forty-eight page booklet but I was disappointed with the reproduction of most of them.  The booklet says they have been 're-created with meticulous care', unfortunately, this is not the case.  Too many of them have been printed in four colors rather than black line and tone images (those of you in graphic arts will know I'm referring to line & tone combine) which would have given the type in most cases a crisp edge.  Some of these facsimiles look very grey, for instance, the original letter from Albert Einstein to President Roosevelt was just black typewriter but it looks (like many others in the box) like a photocopy. However, all the contents of the box have the statement 2002 CHRONICLE BOOKS printed very precisely in black.  It is a shame the editors did not go the extra mile and try to create the best facsimiles possible, this box of history is sold on the basis of being able to handle original looking copies.A book that covers the war years in printed ephemera that I've always enjoyed looking at is [[ASIN:187272714X America's Wartime Scrapbook - Pearl Harbour to V-J]] by Charles Numark and Martin Jacobs, not really concerned with historical detail it has many color collages created from hundreds of printed items which give an accurate feel of the Home Front.	2003-08-03

John Hinde's wonderful photos capture a peculiarly British phenomenon, the Butlin's vacation camp.  As photographer Martin Parr says in his intro...Billy Butlin had the great idea of providing a holiday park for the working class, where they could have a good time despite the English weather.  The price included everything, accommodation, food and entertainment so the camps where very popular with families, ma and pa could do what they wanted knowing that the kids, not being able to stray from the enclosed site, could play all day in safety.       The fifty-five large, pin-sharp photos in this book capture exactly the feel and ambience of the various Butlin camps around the country.  They all show groups of people, indoors and out, eating, dancing (ballroom dancing was always a big draw for pensioners) swimming, relaxing or whatever.  Hinde used real campers for these photos and in nearly every one, if you look closely, you can always spot one person who is looking at the camera, I bet they were told to ignore the camera and all the lights and look as if they were having a good time.  As these pictures show the British relaxing on vacation there are naturally plenty of men wearing a jacket, collar and tie, on sunny days too!    I think this is a lovely book that captures, with documentary style photos, the seventies look of a unique English institution.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-07-27

An amazing resource book if you are interested in the American home from 1880.    Tad Burness started in the sixties collecting illustrations, photos and ads of anything to do with domestic housing and this book is the result of his endeavours. You need to know though that the book is essentially visual and 2500 images are shown in a scrapbook format, with many of them irregular shapes, where a house, for instance, has been cut out from its background,     Each crammed page has between nine to fourteen pictures (plenty in color) which could include six or seven exterior house photos or illustrations, possibly taken from period ads, three or four interiors (also from period ads) mostly kitchens and bathrooms, maybe a floor plan or some period ads for a heating system, door handles or property.  Many of these items have a few handwritten words from the author.   I rather liked these very busy, crammed pages but I could see that they might not be to everybody's taste.     This large  paperback is a fascinating overview of a hundred years of American housing but if you want to see pictorial books with a more formal presentation have a look at these: 'Houses by Mail', by Katherine Stevenson and Ward Jandl, a picture and floor plan of the hundreds of styles sold by Sears Roebuck from 1908 to 1940.  For domestic interiors of the fifties and sixties check out two books by Eugene Moore: [[ASIN:0764304585 Inspiring Interiors from Armstrong 1950s]] and [[ASIN:0764307002 Interior Solutions from Armstrong the 1960s]] both use several hundred room set photos taken from Armstrong flooring ads.

For years car ads must have been the ultimate goal for any slick photorealist style artist though I bet there was actually only a small number who could achieve the high standards required by Detroit.  The five hundred ad paintings in this book are the pick of the crop.  They run from 1923 thru 1965, from the mid-sixties photos were the dominant graphic in car ads.      As these ads were doing their best to put a positive spin on owning a particular make, paintings were the ideal medium to create desire and so much easier to exaggerate reality.  A whole society of wee folk was created to spend their lives zooming about town or country, permanently smiling and always waving to somebody along the highway. According to these paintings, most cars would easily accommodate four people in the front.  The 1948 Hudson ad (page eighty-five) shows a wee person enjoying `...a heaping portion of roominess and comfort...' sitting on a back seat that looks like it could easily hold six.   By the mid-sixties photography had replaced illustrations but the exaggeration continued, have a look at `Boulevard Photographic' by Jim Williams, the story of Detroit's leading car photo studio.    I found it very interesting that these cars, very precisely painted, were usually placed in a setting that did not require the same amount of accuracy.  The more popular makes were shown in everyday situations, pages ninety-four and ninety-five show three super street scenes with everybody looking at the latest model, naturally.  Nearly all these ad paintings are anonymous but there are some by well-known artists, Austin Briggs painted the 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air and 1958 Chevrolet Impala, Stan Galli did the 1955 Bel Air and Bernie Fuchs the 1960 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.  The ultimate in car art was the work of Art Fitzpatrick (car) and Van Kaufman (background) who created dozens of masterpieces for Pontiac in the fifties and sixties, the book has twenty-two of their ads.  Have a look at their web siteFitz-art.     Though this is a lovely book of car ads, I was disappointed by the presentation.  Collectors Press editorial style is to make each page of their books as busy as possible.  All of the spreads in this one have colored backgrounds and (really annoying) many of the ads are angled and overlap each other, several of them are cropped badly too, so that some of the text is unreadable.   It is as if the publishers didn't think the material was very interesting and the pages needed some strong graphic presentation to compensate.  It does take the edge of a fine book in my view.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-07-13

The author concentrates on steam streamline trains rather than the modern and efficient diesels that eventually replaced the great steamers of the Thirties and Forties.  Streamline steam was an engine with a shroud to cover all the bits and pieces that made these huge units look rather ugly.<br /><br />The railroads needed something to encourage passengers back onto trains, amazingly, between 1921 and 1933, passenger journeys declined by fifty-eight per cent. No doubt car ownership increased during this period though.  Fortunately, for the railroads, a small group of industrial designers came to the rescue and designed not only the engine but the whole train and passengers were convinced.  The author covers the work of Raymond Loewy, Otto Kuhler, Norman Bel Geddes, Henry Dreyfuss, Walter Dorwin Teague and others responsible for the stunning looking trains of the period.  He has definitely put in a lot of research and the result is a very comprehensive study.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, I found the book extremely dull to look at.  There is no design to the pages, no creative use of photos of these great looking trains.  Except for eight pages of color at the back all the photos are in black and white and most annoying, plenty of repetition. For example, pages 112-113 have six photos of the Pennsylvania Railroad's Loewy designed T-1, page 79 has three of the Chicago & Northwestern's E4, one photo of each of these engines would have been enough.  What makes it worse is that so many of the duplicate photos are only slightly different from each other.  Perhaps someone thought why use one photo when three, four or five of the same engine can be used on the same spread!  The small color section at the back has five rather mediocre paintings and two washed out color photos, a rather pointless section in my view.  For a book that is full of detail and information why is there no index?<br /><br />Most books about streamline trains tend to concentrate on diesels but have a look out for `The Streamline Era' by Robert Reed, very comprehensive on steamliners and it covers other streamlined transport.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.reamline Era' by Robert Reed, very comprehensive on steamliners and it covers other streamlined transport.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-07-08

Mad cover artist Richard Williams is special too, he and Norman Mingo have done the most covers over the years. Williams painted the cover to `Mad Art' (click on the cover above to see a larger version) based on a Norman Rockwell painting for the cover of The Saturday Evening Post, February 13, 1960. <br />If you are a Mad fan you'll enjoy `Mad Art' but bear in mind that it is a showcase for the artists and of the hundreds of pictures included very few are of complete articles. There are thirty pages in color and I would have liked to see more, however Mad covers (issue 1 thru 400) are all in color in `Mad Cover to Cover' by Frank Jacobs, a handy companion book to `Mad Art'.

Having just bought a new pc with Windows XP installed I thought it would be a good idea to get a book or two about the operating system or software I'm going to use. A problem I've found with computer titles is that they frequently handle, what is essentially a visual subject, with words, words and more words. An instructional screen shot and caption can save an awful lot of text. I had a quick glance through several titles dealing with XP, they were either:<BR>1. Huge, definitive, expensive thousand-page jobs, all right for experts but not me. <BR>2. Lots of colorful screen shots and captions but too simple and too expensive<BR>3. Small, cheap, pocket-sized and text-crammed with a few screen shots and very boring to look at.<br />I think I've found the ideal title with this `Windows XP: Visual Quickstart Guide'. It is basically a reference book with step-by-step numbered instructions and tips with screen shots (in black and white) presented in two columns on each page. You can see some of the pages by clicking on 'see inside this book' under the cover picture above. The writing is simple, straightforward and in nineteen chapters I find it very comprehensive. It is aimed at the beginner and intermediate (that's me) pc user, so if you are just starting out you'll be pleased to find that chapter one begins with `Logging on'. Another good test for a pc book is the quality of its index (I even looked at two that had no index) and this one has nineteen pages. <br />I think that Chris Fehily's `Windows XP' is an absolute bargain but if you do want something basic and colorful have a look at `Windows XP plain & simple' by Jerry Joyce and Marianne Moon. Each page has plenty of screen shots and short numbered captions. It's a nicely designed landscape book aimed at the beginner and published by Microsoft but certainly not as comprehensive as the Visual Quickstart Guide.	2003-06-26

Gary Gladstone's neat idea to photograph residents in some of the oddest named places in the US makes an interesting book.  Most of the places are tiny towns or less and only needed a weird name to be included.  I'm not sure why Flushing, a pretty big place in an even bigger place, New York, was included though.  <br />Each place has a spread with the text and small map on the left-hand page and a photo on the right-hand page.  The photos are really good too, great color and compositions.  The text, also written by Garry Gladstone, is fun to read and gives you a flavor of the people and places he visited but the little colored maps are next to useless, it would have been far better to have included ZIP codes or highway numbers for those readers who want to find these places on a map.  I have just spent a pleasant afternoon finding most of them by using DeLorme's `Street Atlas USA' CD-ROM, just by putting in the place and state name.<br />The real disappointment to me are the single photos on the right-hand pages.  After travelling 38,000 miles in nine trips over five years and taking 21,000 photos surely we should get more than one per place?  Nearly all of them are close-ups of people and look as if they could have been taken anywhere.  There are a few exceptions, Lovely, PA and War, WV show a little of the area behind the head and shoulders of the people photographed.  I would like to see more of these heartland of America places, a street scene or a store, diner, garage, a few houses, a highway sign naming each place.  It's not as if there is no space, the text and photos on each spread leave masses of white space (designers call this working white) in this rather over-designed book.<br />`Passing Gas' is a great idea but I wish I could have seen many more of the 21,000 wonderful photos Gary Gladstone took on his travels.	2003-06-10

More than 250 are shown, in color, either one or four to a page in this almost LP size book. Fortunately none of them are angled or overlapping each othe. As the covers are arranged chronologically you can see how the big names and some one-hit wonders, were graphically presented by their record companies. Johnny Cash has ten covers from 1956 to 1985, Dolly Parton six from 1967 to 1987, Waylon Jennings six from 1966 to 1985. <br />Most of the covers before the Seventies follow the usual album design format, bland photo of the artist and some dull colored typography, though there are some exceptions, for instance Porter Wagoner's 'Confessions of a Broken Man' or 'Skid Row Joe'.  It is not until the Seventies before the whole package was considered as one design element, like the Kinky Friedman's 'Lasso From El Passo' (made to look like a Camel cigarette pack) or Dolly Parton's '9 to 5 and Odd Jobs'. The covers shown from the Eighties mostly have well taken expressive photography combined with interesting graphics. <br />Country fans will enjoy seeing these historical covers, if only to see the ones they owned and possibly regret throwing out years ago. On page sixteen I came across a Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant album, '2 Guitars Country Style', I had in the late Fifties and then junked years later but fortunately re-issued on CD. 'Vinyl Hayride' is the same large size as an expanding collection of books devoted to LP cover art and graphic designers will find it worth adding to their reference library.	2003-06-08

I've already got [[ASIN:0262192365 Plain Pictures of Plain Doctoring: Vernacular Expression in New Deal Medicine and Photography - 80 photographs from the Farm Security Administration (Mit ... Humanistic & Social Dimensions of Medicine)]] and [[ASIN:0970354444 An American Journey: Images of Railroading During the Depression]] and this excellent book is the first to show dozens of great photos of children (and teenagers).    The author's explain in the intro that at the peak of the Depression about a quarter of the workforce were unemployed and because no child labor laws had been passed this huge number included some children, especially in agriculture.  Most of the photos in this book show children in a rural setting, where it was expected that they would help their parents increase the family income.     Sixteen of the FSA photographers work is included and the author's have searched for photos that are seldom or have never been published before and this is one reason I liked the book.  Another is the large format landscape size. All the images have a short caption, date, photographer's name and Library of Congress negative file number. There are a couple of slightly annoying production points: the lack of page numbers, even though there is a contents page with a page number for each of the seven chapters and the ten pages of introduction are numbered but with roman numerals, who uses these nowadays.    Fortunately not all the photos show hard times and despair, one chapter, called 'Playing', shows kids having fun, another, 'Living' has a 1940 Marion Post Wolcott shot of five laughing teenagers folding newspapers on a front lawn in Natchitoches, Louisiana. As you would expect though most of the rest of these sensitively taken photos do show children just having to make do in those extraordinary years.      If you collect books of FSA output or just want to see some great descriptive photos of the past 'Children of the Depression' is well worth owning.  Another book on the same subject (and written for the younger market) is [[ASIN:0618446303 Children of the Great Depression (Golden Kite Awards (Awards))]] which uses FSA photos to go with the text.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-06-07

Yet another roadie book but `Readymades' is a cut above the usual photographic selection of what can be seen along the nation's back roads.  For a start the book is landscape, just the right shape for images that are basically horizontal.  Secondly the photos are divided into sections rather than loosely hung together by state or date order.  Thirdly the choice of material is refreshing, for example, tract housing, freight cars, trailers or storage units (no kidding).<br /><br />This is Jeff Brouws second road book, his first, the excellent `Highway: America's Endless Dream', was more the traditional photographic road book, a mixture of everything plus a selection of interesting black and white images from the thirties and forties.  I like the formal arrangement of `Readymades'. By having each of the eleven chapters devoted to a particular theme he \\"presents the subject in the most factual terms possible\\" as Diana Gaston says in her intro. The chapters are tract housing, signs, abandoned drive-ins, farms, pickups, abandoned gas stations, boxcars, signs two, trailers, bowling and finally storage units.<br /><br />Partially painted pickup trucks are just that, twenty-five of them are all taken side on and nicely framed within the image area.  Twenty-six abandoned gas stations (in black and white) are one to a page and just the sort of thing Robert Frank would have stopped his car for back in the fifties.  Freight cars, again one to a page and neatly framed, are an amazing colored selection of various shades of rust and railroad livery. Perhaps the most unusual chapter is storage units, hardly the sort of thing to capture the creative eye but here they are, eighteen shots including a stunning one taken in West Virginia in 2001 showing three power station cooling towers in the distance, the storage units in the middle and a parking lot in the foreground.  The photos of these units remind me of Lewis Baltz and his photos of the industrial parks in Irvine, CA, simple oblongs just placed in the landscape.<br /><br />`Readymades' is a refreshing look and presentation of the vernacular everyday and I think it might well turn out to be a classic photo book of the decade.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.in the landscape.    `Readymades' is a refreshing look and presentation of the vernacular everyday and I think it might well turn out to be a classic photo book of the decade.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-06-02

In this admittedly small (but almost an inch thick) book there are five hundred+ ad characters (actually more like seven hundred if multiples are included).  Divided into eight chapters, Food, Drinks, Kids' stuff, Dining, Technology, Autos, Home and finally Personal and Leisure, they are all in color, captioned and dated. All the well-known characters are included but also many who had a regional existence, like Mr Clean-Up, the 1946 St. Louis Chamber of Commerce antilitter campaigner, or Waddle's Duckling, a 1959 icon from the Portland, Oregon restaurant.  Warren Dotz writes a short intro and explains how companies realised that these characters would bring huge concerns down to human scale, especially if they became half human and half product and always with that smiling face. A useful companion book is 'What a Character', also by the author and it shows many 'Mr Product' icons as three-dimensional figurines, thus reinforcing customer brand loyalty further.  Visually the book is a delight to look at, thanks to the design by the author and Masud Husain. Handling this kind of material is a challenge because of all the different shapes and colors but here many of the characters are whole page or four to a page and a nice touch is to show them in the context of an ad, brochure cover or a packet front. I don't think the book could look any better.    BTW: I think the paper could have been just a bit thinner for ease of handling and an index would have been useful. Oh, and I was disappointed that Mad magazine wraparound cover painting (by Norman Mingo) of issue thirty-five (October 1957) was not reproduced somewhere, it was most likely the only time that dozens of copyright ad characters where used on a magazine cover.  ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-05-26

Taschen's fourth volume of the All-American Ads series provides a big look back to the day before yesterday.  Steven Heller provides a short overview of the decade and explains that despite the Depression magazines, in which most of these ads appeared, had very high circulations.  For a few cents readers could escape the reality of everyday life and be entertained by the features and the colourful advertisements. Naturally there is no real mention of the Depression though some of the ads sport the little NRA symbol and the words `We do our part'<br />The format of this book is the same as the others, nine sections (Alcohol and tobacco, Automobiles, Consumer products, Entertainment, Fashion and beauty, Food and beverages, Industry, Interiors and finally Travel) provide whole, two or four ads to a page and fortunately none of them are angled or overlap.  The digital reproduction of the 1500+ ads is excellent, it is always a problem to reproduce anything that is already printed because it can create screen clash but these are reproduced with clean colors and sharp lines (thanks to 175 dpi).<br />Most of these ads are copy and picture heavy, stylish use of white space and clever typography was years away, though three ads for Pierce Arrow autos on pages 176-177 stand out because they do seem very modern.  Illustrations rather than photography were the main visual elements with headlines and copy used to fill any space that was left.  <br />This as a super book if you are interested in social history or want to see how copywriters created product desire more than sixty years ago or you are just curious about things your grandparents reminisce about.  Maybe they remember the 1932 ads for the Pitcairn autogiro, after all no home should be without one!	2003-05-18
US	43058502	R27AGP8PFDDA58	3822811998	276384964	Marilyn	Books	5	23	23	N	N	Marilyn boxed.	I've got copy 4066 of this sumptuous (and reassuringly?) expensive package and I thought this review should really detail what you'll get for your money.    ONE: An oversize Kodak color film box, nineteen inches high by sixteen wide and three deep, this is a big facsimile of the box that De Dienes kept some of his Marilyn prints in. The package weighs twelve pounds and will hardly fit any bookcase. The inside has recesses for the two books and one booklet. Black silk tape allows for easy access of the contents.    TWO: A large, beautifully designed and printed, 240 page book of Marilyn photos printed on thick paper. Although the printing screen is not the highest (150 dpi) the photos leap off the page, especially the full-page color ones. Many of these photos seem to be very private shots of Marilyn that De Dienes took during her career (a few show her with other people, a hairdresser and bookseller). Several at the back of the book show Marilyn's face montaged into clouds or surrounded by celestial bodies. Between the photos, printed in silver ink and in a large typewriter font, there are excepts from De Dienes memoirs. Also printed in silver are smaller photos with his hand-written captions.    THREE: A booklet with twenty-four, one to a page, magazine covers featuring De Dienes photos of Marilyn. Seventeen of them are European titles. Predictably, great photos are weakened by logos, cover lines and generally poor cropping. I thought this booklet was rather disappointing in its production.     FOUR: The 608 page facsimile of De Dienes manuscript and composite book. I think this is the most fascinating item in the box because of the production problems. The original pages were typed on one side of a sheet of ordinary paper and this facsimile is on similar weight stock so that the back of each page has some text showing through, as the original (There is a production problem here though, the paper rightly has text show-through but the photos do as well, on the original paper only the white back of the photo would have been visible). Although the manuscript was in black and white it has been printed in four colors to create the aged paper look and the few handwritten numbers in green and red that De Dienes wrote on the photos. You can see all of his corrections and deletions to the manuscript and read the comments he wrote about the various contact prints of Marilyn and other printed ephemera he stuck on back of each page.    The original composite section has a hundred pages (it becomes two-hundred pages in this facsimile) of cut-out contact prints which De Dienes stuck on the typewriter paper, again they are reproduced in four-color black because of the occasional handwritten colored numbers, even the image of the punched file holes on each page is reproduced. Hundreds of these contacts show how he photographed Marilyn and you can see how dozens of shots were taken of which only one or two were probably published. Most of these images have never been seen before and certainly never in the form that they are presented here.     Overall I think the Marilyn Box is an amazing production package. A world famous visual icon is presented in a unique way.    *** FOR A LOOK INSIDE click customer images under the contents photo.	2003-05-05

No, neither have I but you'll find them in Frans Lanting's beautiful paperback of penguin photos, along with the emperor, gentoo, king, magellanic, chinstrap, adelie and rockhopper, all in dazzling color.  As he says in the books short introduction it is not a natural history of these amazing birds but a personal photographic interpretation shot over a ten-year period.  The birds are shown in all weather conditions, as huge groups, ten or so and as individuals in very detailed close-ups.  Naturally the close-ups of parents with chicks are the most appealing photos in the book.<br /><br />Many of the photos have captions and rather strangely there are twenty-four pages at the back of the book with thumbnails of all the photos and detailed captions, I would have thought it better to use these pages for more photos and have a caption (where needed) on each page.  Apart from this I think it is a lovely book of penguin photographs and excellent value too.	2003-05-04

There are lots of good books about Art Deco as an overall art style but Patricia Kery seems to have corned the market with this title covering graphics.  Large size, 320 pages and with 476 illustrations it will most likely be the standard reference for many years. The first chapter, `Foundations of Art Deco graphic style' is a lucid explanation and the following chapters (printed on light mauve paper) expand on this excellent start.  The illustrations are fortunately printed on glossy white paper.    Good as the book is though I was rather disappointed with the presentation.  All of the spreads with several pictures have them deliberately unaligned and where there are only two images to a page they are usually the same size with a lot of white space and I mean a LOT.  I think one of the images should have been big and the other smaller, thus reducing all the white space to a minimum.  Typography on the mauve text pages is a mess, various sizes are used and the caption size is really too small.  The left-hand page numbers are on the inside of the page next to the books spine, this seems a silly bit of designer whimsy.    The book is very comprehensive and rightly shows how the creative output of mostly European artists was used commercially.  For an American perspective have a look at this beautifully designed paperback: [[ASIN:0811806626 Streamline: American Art Deco]].  This has excellent illustrations showing how the style was adapted (those famous three speed lines) by American creative folk to sell products rather than a European fine art genre.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-04-15

Someone has done a lot of picture research for this book but it is really a history book rather than a book of excellent photographs.  There are seven parts (American People, Americans in Politics, Americans at War, Building America, Living in America, America at Work and Play in America) and these are divided into forty-five chapters with fifteen or so photos in each, so there are at lest 675 images in the book.<br />I see this more as a visual history because so many of the photographs are included for what they show rather than the quality of the photography, this is especially true of the images from the nineteenth century. As each chapter has to cover its area in so few pictures I was impressed with the picture research, from the thirties onwards, this is particularly good, predictable photos that are seen in most picture history books have been avoided.  Maybe this is because the Hulton Getty Archives have supplied most of them.  Each photo has caption explaining the historical detail but making absolutely no comment on its artistic quality or who the photographer was.<BR> <BR>There are two other areas where I consider the book does not really work as a photo book, the design and printing.  The design is very bland, the photos are big enough but they are not presented in a quality photo-book format, that is, each photo should have some white space round it and be shown in a rather formal setting, most good photography books have the image central on the page and thick margins, not possible with the large number in this book but it would not have been too difficult to design a format that worked better for all this interesting material.  The printing unfortunately lacks any true blacks, fine for the average image-driven book but this one is presenting photographs that require depth and sharpness and so many of these are showing too much grey.<br />This book is fine as a photo history of America but not a book of fine photographs of America.  Similar in style isa small but thick, 830 page paperback, `The American Millennium' by Nick Yapp, very well produced with photos (also from the excellent Hulton Getty Archives) from 1860 to the present, including some color too.	2003-04-13

Look through this book for the first time and the contents seem a bit like ordinary snapshots but look again and then again and with each viewing the images become more familiar (still with something fresh to discover each time) but now they start to blend together seamlessly. One reason for this, I think, is that the photos capture the everyday and the ordinary. Taken around Eggleston's hometown of Memphis and in the Deep South, they show some of his relations, street scenes, interiors, buildings and more, though the captions only state the locations. John Szarkowski says in the books introduction \\"..today's most radical and suggestive color photography derives much of its vigor from commonplace models\\" This capturing of the everyday and in color divided the critics in 1976 when the Museum of Modern Art used seventy-five of Egglestons's images for their first exhibition of color photography. The 'Guide' unfortunately only shows forty-eight from the show.    Art photography until this exhibition was in black and white and had been for years, color photos were mostly for ads, commercial print and snapshots. Thankfully the Museum's curator of photography, Szarkowski, had the good sense to allow the public to see something new and fresh. I think the 'Guide' is a good introduction to Eggleston and if you like his creative vision, as I do, have a look at these two books of his work:[[ASIN:0385266510 The Democratic Forest]] and [[ASIN:0517143933 Ancient & Modern]].

The Lomeo's  photo book follows the usual format for this kind of publication, thematic chapters titled From sea to shining sea, Rural life, The open road, Vanishing America etc, etc and I have recently reviewed a similarly predictable book, `USA' by Jordi Miralles, this had nine hundred plus photos, which turned out to be just too much, though it was a very reasonably priced paperback.  Fortunately `America America' has fewer and much better images.  <br />This is not a photo book with a point of view about America like Robert Frank's `The Americans' or Joel Sternfield's  `American Prospects' rather it captures the surface look of the Nation in stunning, technically correct, well composed images and this is the reason I like it.

Look through the five hundred photos in this book and be amazed at how such a simple vehicle has developed over the last hundred years. Early gasoline tractors were cumbersome and heavy, the makers assumed that they would replace the cumbersome and heavy steam tractors, they should have done some market research (probably unheard of at the turn of the last century) because farmers wanted small vehicles and it took until 1912 before they got what they wanted. The machines slowly evolved to suit agricultural needs, getting more and more powerful (and once again heavier) until today when the agri business uses huge diesel units with twelve tires (to spread the weight) strangely it was not until the 70s that the makers thought the driver might like a cab to protect him from the elements. <br />This paperback (at amazing value for the price) covers the history of the American tractor with excellent color pictures of the various makes. The photos are mostly three-quarter or side views of the complete unit, with many close-ups of a logo or engine, they all have technically detailed captions. I thought the quality of the photos was very impressive which was the main reason I bought the book. The older models are covered by contemporary photos rather than illustrations from period ads, these machines have all been carefully restored to 'like new' by collectors. <br />Between the pages showing historical development there are plenty of spreads called 'Classic Profile' where famous models are covered in more photographic and spec detail. My favorite is the Raymond Lowey designed 1947 Farmall H from International Harvester. Was it the world's first streamlined tractor? It must have got something right because IH shifted 390,317 units at $962 each. If you want some good historical visual reference to tractors get this well designed and printed paperback, at a bargain price too.	2003-04-06

Look at the products in this catalog and wonder what all the fuss was about.  Everything looks so everyday but in 1934 when this Machine Art exhibition was running at the Museum of Modern Art in New York most of  the 402 exhibits must have seemed very futuristic.  The original catalog was unfortunately very bland looking with two short essays, by Alfred Barr and Philip Johnson (who chose the objects and designed the show) a list of the companies that loaned items and 118 photos of objects from the six categories in the exhibition, industrial units, household, kitchenware, furnishings, scientific instruments and laboratory glass. I thought it was interesting that each company had their address and the product price included, the Museum must have thought this was a good opportunity to show the public how modern design was affordable.  The general acceptance of the style was because so many of the products on display were to do with the service areas of the home, garage, kitchen or bathroom, where clean lines and efficiency would be welcome.<br />I doubt that the Museum realised in 1934 what an important exhibition this would be and this facsimile of a dull looking catalog (photographed directly from an original) does not capture the excitement of the style.  I think the best book on the subject is `The Machine Age in America' by Richard Guy Wilson.  For a stunning collection of product photos have a look at Stewart Johnson's `American Modern 1925-1940 Design for a New Age'.	2003-04-02

Most of them are low budget stock shots bought by small record labels for their LP covers. Mainstream record companies were too conservative to use such blatant selling techniques.  None of the covers are of any photographic or design interest (and most of the music on these LPs was produced by session musicians and is of no particular interest either).     The hundred plus covers are presented one to a page with some copy on the adjacent page, this is rather overgenerous for the text because there is really nothing to say about the covers so the author's repeat bits of the cliched copy from the back covers.  I think the (mildly) most interesting covers are the ones produced for the American bachelor market during the fifties and sixties, these are now so ancient and of such awfulness that they take on a curiosity  of their own.    I think it is only worth getting this book if you are interested in this very tiny corner of commercial art or maybe you'll want to own the only book that will ever be published about the subject.  Worth checking out though is `Vixens of Vinyl' by Benjamin Darling, a nicely produced little book (six by six inches) of LP covers that feature females but not nudes. These covers are from major labels so at least you'll see some decent photography and design.	2003-03-25

Because the business of America is business signs are everywhere, usually colorful and just asking to be captured by any passing photographer. To avoid looking like other photo books of public lettering and signage the author deliberately goes for a tight shot and most of the photos only show letter parts but as Lewis Blackwell says in his introduction, Fella is not interested in what the letters say.<br />With the tight photo cropping and a dull layout (all the photo pages are the same: nine, three by three inch Polaroid's, including their white border, butted up to each other, no captions or page numbers) I think this ends up as a very boring looking but nevertheless intensely personal book of public typography. The best images are the ones that have been produced by sign makers, or are obviously commercially printed. Vernacular signs, where someone has painted or scrawled some letters, are mostly produced by amateurs, who given the choice (and money) would much prefer to have something that looked professional, where any repeat letters look identical, have even spacing and all sit on the same base line. Vernacular neon signs do not exist because they can only be made by professionals. <br />Between the photos there are twelve sections showing the author's own creative typography, loosely based on the vernacular letters he has photographed and consequently showing the same amateurish feel and more critically in my view, a high degree of un-readability. This individuality to type is also reflected in the books production. The few text pages with two columns per page appear to have been pasted up so that paragraphs do not line up, the imprint page and the cover flaps have type that is deliberately unaligned This silly messing about with the text stops short of doing anything to the back cover barcode though, commerce wins in the end!	2003-03-24
US	43058502	R364SVVMC0JTPM	0823055833	580046706	USA	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A pretty look at the USA.	This is one of those generalised photo books that pop up every so often, another title could be `America: A Book To Remember Her By'. Priced very reasonable and with 900 well printed color photos it captures the feel of the country but in a very tourist postcard way.  <br />Divided into three sections, Landscape and Lifestyle both have six chapters, Architecture has three.  I thought the Landscape had the best material, Lifestyle with its photos of people doing things are really not much better than snapshots that anyone could have taken and many of them are badly cropped.  Architecture with its chapters on Public buildings, Traditional homes and Contemporary homes seems rather out of place especially the fifty-six pages devoted to contemporary interiors, technically good photos but they look like they should be in an interior design magazine.  Many of the photos have captions but they are just bland comments with few facts.  Strangely there is no information about the person who did all the work, photographer Jordi Miralles,. another indication that these hundreds of images are really no more than pleasant tourist reminders of an amazing country.<br />I expect `USA' will sell well at airports, just the thing for departing visitors to pick up.  If you want a reminder of your visit a more thoughtful and less overwhelming (least in photo numbers) book is `America America' by photographers Sonja and Angelo Lomeo.  These two know their stuff, good compositions, color and subject matter and beautifully printed too.	2003-03-16

Maybe this is because there is so much of it around, and in a huge country it seems all too easy to walk away from a building, a vehicle, a sign that has become redundant. To remove it becomes someone else's problem but before that happens a lot of photographers can show their creativity by capturing it on film.    Steve Gottlieb has travelled the country looking for, as the chapters show, houses and barns, factories and equipment, vehicles, signs and facades and finally a kaleidoscope of odds and ends. Another reviewer has mentioned the color and this is what I noticed first, it is very garish and uneven and there are very few true blacks anywhere. The technical notes mention that the images have been color corrected where needed and although the plates are printed in a very fine screen (over 200 dpi I think) the lack of solid blacks give most of the photos a pastel feel and detracts from the raw grittiness of the subject.    It is also a book of unfortunate technical contrasts, page twelve shows an old wooden house surrounded by bright (color corrected?) green trees making the photo look rather artificial yet turn over the page and there is a stunning black and white (using the four color black printing process) photo of three abandoned houses with a dead tree in the middle of the composition. Page 136 shows a deserted amusement park with very washed out color, over the page a super image of an abandoned hospital in New York with Manhattan in the background looking just like someone has made a collage of various skyscrapers and created a city skyline.     It is the uneven color that spoils the book for me. I have some books that cover the (almost) same subject better and they are inblack and white, this seems much more appropriate for this material, 'Meadowlands' by Ray Mortenson, covering the industrial landscape of New Jersey, 'The Hand of Man on America' by David Plowden and 'Dead Tech' with photos by Manfred Hamm. This is a quite extraordinary book of photos (and text) of abandoned technology in Europe and America. For very controlled color work have a look at 'The Democratic Forest' by William Eggleston and 'Written in the West' by film director Wim Wenders, photos of abandoned bric-a-brac from southewest USA.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-03-16

This book of  sixty-two, originally published in 1987, is thankfully still in print.  They were taken in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas while Wenders was looking for locations for his movie 'Paris, Texas'.  Predictably they show a European notion of America so most of them capture what could be considered a rather negative image, abandoned gas stations in the desert, deserted movie theatres and shops, neon signs, everyday commercial activity and more.  But they are taken with a sympathetic eye and great feeling.    There are six really great images of street corners, this kind of shot always works, shop-fronts and parked cars stretch into the distance while the immediate foreground provides close-up detail.  As with all Wenders photos the color is very controlled and he takes advantage of the very strong dark shadows created by the sunlight in this part of the country.  There are four interior photos which I don't think are too successful, very dark and rather lacking in composition.    I don't think this will be a photo book to everybody's taste, because of the subject matter but if you like the grittiness of the American street scene it is well worth owning.  A book that captures the same area in great color photos is 'Southwest USA' (ISBN 0500541213) by another German, Gerd Kittel.  More broader in scope than 'Written in the West', it includes many interior and  landscape photos as well as the small town street scenes.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-03-12

This time, a huge 704 page, beautifully designed and printed pictorial collection of the essence of Scandinavian creativity. Although it covers the obvious furniture, metalware, glass, textiles and ceramics it also considers commercial products from companies like Fiskars, Hasselblad, IKEA, Lego, Saab, Volvo and nicely, even a company like Kompan, a producer of childrens playground equipment that is sold worldwide. I think this is one reason for the commercial and creative success of Scandinavian products, they believe that good, simple design should be applied to everything and be available to all, the introduction calls these products democratic objects.    The book is a joy to look at. Each designer (or company with their logo) starts on a spread with a small head shot of the person, some text and the rest of the space, sometimes over several pages, devoted to photos. Interestingly with so many photos (more than 1600) many of which came from various sources, the color values are very similar and they all blend together throughout the book. I think Taschen are to be congratulated on producing (yet again) a stunning looking book that covers the subject so well and anyone involved with craft creativity and design will be pleased to have a copy.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-03-08

Just flick the pages of this book and marvel at the ingenuity of the food technologist, page fifty-eight shows a 1965 packet of Kellogg's Strawberry Kreme Krunch, `Chunks of REAL ICE CREAM Freeze-dried in a nutritious cereal' or page seventy-nine with a 1960s packet of King Stir wands with `SIX IMITATION ROOT BEER FLAVOR DRINKS'.  Everything is either flavor-enhanced, sugar-coated or artificial, just the way kids like it too.<br />All the colorful packets come from a huge collection the two author's have amassed over the last fifteen years, starting with a 1930s 5c packet of Mickey Mouse Cookies (which looks in surprisingly good condition considering it is over sixty years old) and moving through the years to the Seventies.  The boxes and containers are predictably designed with bright colors and sledgehammer graphics to catch the eye of tiny tots in the supermarket aisles.  An interesting exception is the 1970s very graphic Screaming Yellow Zonkers! Popcorn snack box which was black with some small colored lettering.<br />The food makers knew how to pitch their packaging for maximum sales so they used the popular heroes of the time, Superman, Popeye, Dick Tracy, Hopalong Cassidy (I wonder if he ever ate those Burry's cookies) and as the packets show, in more modern times the makers created food with their own heroes, like Cap'n Crunch or Puddin' Head.<br />If you grew up in the Fifties, Sixties or Seventies you'll enjoy this well designed paperback of colourful food packaging, mostly breakfast cereals but also drinks, cake-mixes, candy, Jell-O, ice cream, cookies and more.  There's nothing artificial about this book!	2003-03-08

I don't know if this is a case of buy a book and get a flag or the other way round, either way the flag comes off best, it's three by five foot and made of filament polyester.  As to the book I think Old Glory deserves better, there are sixty-two photos in seventy-two pages and many of them are blurred (not because the flag is fluttering in the wind) or over enlarged, a few of them are really not worth including.  The images  came from stock photo agencies, a page in the back of the book gives their names and pages numbers, only the book has no page numbers (this might give you an idea about seriously the publishers took this production) so there are no photographer's credits or captions to tell you where or when each photo was taken.  Of course some of the photos are worth looking at, one of the flag made of neon certainly is and several of the outdoor ones are arresting.<br />At the start of the book Whitney Smith of the Flag Research Center writes a short essay about the origins of the flag  but does not include a diagram about how to fold it correctly or say anything about the strong and enduring symbolism of the twelve folds.  For a package that includes a real flag I feel this is a major omission.<br />Far better than `The American Flag', are two books by leading American graphic designer Kit Hinrichs, `Stars&amp; Stripes' has the work of ninety-six designers and their graphic interpretations of the flag.  A book of coffee table proportions and stunningly designed is `Long May She Wave', it features hundreds of images from Hinrichs own huge flag collection.  Finally, have a look at `United We Stand' by Peter Gwillim Kreitler, a lovely little paperback with 106 magazine covers from July 1942 all of which have the flag as a prominent part of the cover design.

A well printed paperback facsimile of the original 1939 hardback edition of this famous book.  The 112 photos, one to a page with a short headline and quote, capture the desperate times thousands of farmers and their families endured in the South and Midwest and their migration to an uncertain future in California.  Nearly all of the photos were taken by Dorothea Lange and this includes forty-six that she took for the Farm Security Administration between 1935 and 1938.     In the back of the book there are two essays, one by Sam Stourdze, is an excellent explanation of how Lange and Taylor compiled the book.  The sales fell well short of their expectations and Stourdze comments \\"the rigor of its approach, the verism of its oral testimony and the radicality of its photographs were hardly designed to have mass appeal\\"  Quite right I think, having looked through the book many times I don't think the powerful photos are backed up by adequate captions.  All the photos are anonymous, even the ones with people, and surely any reader would want to know who are these folk, what is their story?  This information was available because Lange took detailed notes on all her photographic assignments.  It's as if the author's thought the only way they could put their point across was in an abstract way and ignore the very human turmoil the photos clearly show.  In 1937 photographer Margaret Bourke-White and writer Erskine Caldwell compiled a similar photo book about the living conditions of the desperately poor rural underclass, called `You Have Seen Their Faces' (reissued as a paperback in 1995) but here the photos and captions blend together better.    'An American Exodus' is a book of remarkable photos and well worth having if you are interested in America during the Depression years.  BTW, the book reproduces the back dust jacket of the original and the New York publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock, list other \\"Vital books of our Time\\" and for three bucks you could buy 'Mein Kampf' byAdolf Hitler, \\"The blueprint of the Nazi program by the man who is shaking the world.  No American should miss it\\".    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-02-23

I think this new edition of Bill Owens wonderful book is slightly better than the original.  Having both editions I find that although the halftone screen is less than the original (first edition was over 200, this edition is 170) the printing quality and paper are better, giving the photos more depth.  After all these years the images still look fresh and fascinating and the amount of detail the photos contain is amazing.  As far as I am aware no other book comes close in capturing the feel of the American suburb of thirty odd years ago.<br /><br />The book is always favourably mentioned in photo history books as an example of the 'new topography' with photographers like Lewis Baltz, Robert Adams and Stephen Shore and the critics suggest that the citizens of this suburbia lead superficial lives because they live there.  But they can't get round the fact these folk, living in Livermore Amador Valley, California, or perhaps three thousand miles away in Levittown, Long Island enjoy the life-style of suburban living and Owens photos capture this feeling so well.<br /><br />On the visual strength of 'Suburbia' I bought another book of Bill Owens photos, 'Working: I do it for the money', published in 1977, a super collection of photos showing Americans at work and like 'Suburbia' it includes many observations from those in the photos.

It really does start at the beginning: your local bank and its services, checks, ATMs, savings, monthly statements etc. In the other five chapters (Credit, Home finance, Financial planning, Investing, Taxes) most of the other money matters that you'll encounter are explained. <br />Finance seems to be a mystery to a lot of folk so the writer's and designer's of this book have done their best to make it as straightforward as possible and rather than have page after page of what could be very dry text each spread has lots of smart graphics, colored panels and jargon-free text that flows between these visual elements. It is all very controlled and as a publication designer I can appreciate the creative input that has gone into these pages. (I liked it so much I included it in my Listmania 'Ten of my favorite well designed books').<br />If you think you know all about your money this is not the book for you but if you don't then get this book and find out about your finances in these very user friendly pages. The same editorial folk have done another excellent book, 'Guide to Understanding Money and Investing', using the same straightforward language and graphic techniques and although the subject is a lot more complex it is still easy to understand.	2003-02-12

Robert Lebeck approaches photojournalism in a different way from other books on the subject, rather than show photos out of page context he has filled his fascinating  book with the very spreads and pages that readers saw when they bought the magazines.  You can see the pages (a lot smaller than the originals and with the white paper printed as a light sepia) with the headlines, intros, columns of text and of course the photos.  The material comes from the author's huge collection of European and American news magazines, eighty-three are featured, starting with The Illustrated London News (I was the Art Editor of this publication in the late Sixties) from 1871 through to the Sunday Times from 1973.      Lebeck  has selected hundreds of spreads to show how photojournalism developed but I think he has concentrated too much on various wars during the last hundred years though I will admit that these conflicts do give photographers the chance to show readers, at home, something that they would have no chance (or want) to experience. Amongst all the conflicts there are plenty examples of  magnificent photojournalism,  Eugene Smith's famous 1951 Spanish Village photo story from `Life' magazine, here you can see how the ten pages were laid out rather than one or two photos from the seventeen used that most other photo books would use, the 1933 `USSR in Construction' magazine devoted forty pages to the construction of the White Sea Canal with photography by Alexander Rodchenko, twenty-two of these are shown with brilliant layouts also by Rodchenko, as well as filming the 1936 Olympics Leni Riefenstahl took the photos featured on nine pages from  the famous French `L'Illusration' magazine.      The book is beautifully printed and laid out, basically in German but each of the nine chapters has the same text in English and all the captions are in both languages (unfortunately the English captions are in grey type which is a bit hard to read) but what is not translated (why not?) are nineteen pages of biographies of various photographers and photo editors.  If this sort of book appeals to you have a look at these two, `Century' by Bruce Bernard, a monumental news-photo collection in over eleven hundred pages. `Life' magazine, which at its peak was selling eight and a half million copies a week (1968) has plenty of spreads shown in `Kiosk' and more can be seen in `Great Photographic Essays from Life' by Maitland Edey, it has twenty-two of the best photo stories and like `Kiosk' reproduces the actual spreads but here they are the same size as they originally appeared. The Spanish Village is included and also the other famous photo Smith essay, Country Doctor from 1948.      `Kiosk' is a wonderful collection of photo stories and the author hopes to do a second volume covering photo books, like Robert Frank's 1958 `The Americans' or Dorothea Lange's 1939 `An American Exodus', much of what the he might include is shown (nicely as spreads again) in the stunning `The Book of 101 Books: Seminal photographic books of the twentieth century' by Andrew Roth.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2003-01-23

Another wonderful knockout edition in the Taschen six volume All-American Ads series, this book is bursting with pages (960) and color ads (well over 2500) and follows the same design format as the first two editions (Forties and Fifties) with ads as whole page or two or four to the page, all beautifully printed.<br />Unlike the ads from previous decades I found these from the Sixties show a new awareness of design. Shapes and the use of white space is much more creative than in the past, typography, with increased use of photo-setting for headlines and text, gave the hard sell a crispness not seen before. Also Madison Avenue happily turned trend spotter and used psychedelic and op-art, for instance, to convey the message to the reader.<br />There is something for everybody in the nine chapters, my favorites are in Automobiles (164 pages) where twenty-four ads use the painting skills of Arthur Fitzpatrick and Van Kaufman to sell Pontiac cars, these pictures still look great today. In Consumer Products (166 pages) I can even remember one ad, for MasterCard, from Christmas 1969, it showed a realistic model of a city square with some of the buildings made from everyday products, when you get the book turn to pages 428-9 and be amazed. <br />If you lived through the Sixties you'll enjoy this huge book, if you didn't you'll have a chance to catch up on some interesting popular culture.	2003-01-19

Each dome has a page to itself with a caption. Most of the objects inside the domes seem pretty tacky to me, produced as they are for the downmarket tourist trade but near the end of the book there are several advertising domes that look as if their contents have had some thought given to them, M&Ms and the Golden Arches of McDonalds look pretty cool surrounded by snow. The back of the book has a bibliography, web sites (naturally) and index.<br />Books about snowdomes are pretty sparse, only three are listed in the bibliography, the one I have is 'Snowdomes' by Nancy McMichael, this has a better history than the Carnot book and a more flamboyant presentation and it has a picture of a larger-than-life dome on the front cover whose globe area is actually plastic with a liquid and white flakes inside, it must have been a bookbinder's nightmare to produce.<br />Flammarion, the French publishers of Snowdomes also have other books in their Collectible series, I have one on wristwatches and another on pocket knives and as they are all the same square shape they do look good on a bookshelf. All I need now are Collectible books on jukeboxes, QSL cards, model Greyhound buses, pin-up playing cards, Santa Claus, TV station test cards and anything to do with the 1939 New York World's Fair!	2003-01-06

Some of these products would really be hard to parody, the Chai Ceramic Pet that grows vegetation, the Turbi Twist, a hair towel with an elastic loop (with the predictable AS SEEN ON TV on the box) the Copper Tongue Scraper, PROVEN EFFECTIVE was the bold statement on its packaging but it really does look just like a piece of bent metal! Each product has a spread with photos, copy and several colored panels (more on these later) containing background material and other trivia. I liked the Product panels best with their Description, Availability, Claimed Innovation, Upside and the Downside, just read the Downside to each product and really get the truth.<br /><br />The six basic chapters are: Kitchen Marvels; Fashion and Beauty; Fabulous Fitness; Entertainment Breakthroughs; Home Improvement Miracles; Get Rich Quick.  Between these chapters are some interesting features, pages 122 and 123 cover the rise of the home shopping channels where you will be amazed to find that QVC have studio tours. Ron Popiel, the founder of Ronco, has four pages explaining the background to the infomercial techniques he uses to shift the goods. Incidentally the Ronco story is covered in 'But, Wait! There's More!' by Timothy Samuelson, lots of product photos, vintage ads and packaging and a fairly accurate history of the Popiel family. Ever wonder what happened to yesterday's celebrities, check out pages 74 to 79 to see the Top 100 infomercial-land stars from Allen (Debbie) to Zappa (Dweezel) you'll be surprised who's listed, well, perhaps not.

A superb showing of 338 color film noir posters in a marvellous (oversize) book.  None of the posters are angled or overlap each other and they all have credit and comment captions, all this thanks to book designer Bernard Schleifer who handles this rather garish material in a restrained way, though he did make a mistake with the ridiculously small page numbers.  Author Eddie Muller writes just enough to back up the posters without making the book too text heavy and he has come up with some neat ideas, like using posters from other countries, grouping posters according to the director or actor or writer and a chapter that I thought fascinating, `Noir Around The World: Exploring how artists in other cultures rendered a peculiarly American style'.      Look through the book and you'll see how tacky so many of the American illustrations look, whereas the artists used in Europe seem technically better (is this a cultural thing?) and in many cases the poster design is more competent, the Spanish version of Dragnet (1954) on page sixty-three is really graphic yet uses all the usual ingredients, painting of the star, smaller illustrations (in this case the New York skyline and a couple of gangsters) bold type for the title yet turn over the page and a huge American version hits you and it looks a mess in comparison.  However, all these posters capture the spirit of this American movie genre and the book looks so stunning that I don't think the subject could be covered better.    The perfect companion to `The Art of Noir' is `The Noir Style' by Alain Silver and James Ursini (and also beautifully designed by Mr Schleifer) it uses dozens of film stills to explain just what was so special about these movies.  I found it fascinating to see the black and white photos the artists used to create the poster art.  Both books should be in your `noir' collection.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-12-30

A brilliant third volume from the curator of the Photorealist art movement and made more enjoyable because the six hundred plus paintings are all in color. I have the two previous books and good as they were I always felt they were let down by having too many of the 2,323 pictures in black and white but here's an interesting point, the first book had 710 color and 493 b/w, the second book had 560 color and 560 b/w, this latest book has 620 color and no black and whites, does this mean the Movement is on the wane? I hope not because I feel that Photorealism is somehow a uniquely American art movement.    The format follows the same style as the others, an upfront essay (in this case Linda Chase writes about the use of photography by artists over the last century or so) followed by hundreds of illustrations from the featured artists, twenty-eight in this book. These artists are continuing to record 'the fascinating in the familiar' as Ms Chase succinctly puts it and this is one reason I love these paintings, they record Americana so wonderfully. It's worth remembering that when these paintings, many of them huge, are reproduced a few inches wide it tightens up all the detail and they become even more 'photographic'. On page seventeen of the first volume twelve artists work was shown (unfortunately in black and white) the same size as the original painting and you can see how different their brushstrokes are.     Of the artists, some of my favorites are Davis Cone for his movie theatres (and if you like him too, have a look at a lovely book about movie theaters and his paintings, eighty shown in 'Popcorn Palaces') Robert Gniewek for street scenes at night, Charles Bell the pinball wizard, Linda Bacon for her toy tableau's including one called 'Crash' which has a three toy car pile-up and artfully uses Grant Wood's painting 'Death on the Ridge Road' as a backdrop. Perhaps the most amazing paintings in the book are Don Jacot's 'Retro-Active' (it took most of 1998 to paint) and 'Garbo's' (2001) both show shop-fronts with the windows crammed with nostalgia antiques. I sometimes think these artists do their best to make the painting as hard to do as possible!     So, a lovely book to enjoy over and over and thank you Mr Meisel for your faith in these artists and the Photorealist movement. I'm looking forward to the fourth volume around 2010.     ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-12-26

An interesting, visually exuberant, book about Ronco and the Popeil family. Essentially the book is a twenty-four page essay by author Samuelson with the remainder of the pages taken up with pictures and captions describing the various products they sold on TV.<br /><br />Samuelson writes a rather sympathetic history of the Popeil's and the bizarre collection of household wares they pitched to gullible consumers, who can forget the 'inside-the-shell egg scrambler' (1978) or the 'GLH formula number 9 hair system' (1992) most likely everyone who bought them. He also writes that the products had 'unusually high quality product design', looking through the photos of the products this judgement seems way over-the-top. Still, folks bought this stuff by the million thanks to Ron Popeil's excellent marketing hype and fast pitched delivery. This came about because the FCC limited TV commercials to two minutes or less and the Popeil's had honed their pitch for the Veg-O-Matic (1956) to four minutes and could not bear to leave anything out so the only answer was to speak faster.<br /><br />I was surprised by the design of the book, square in shape with three large circular holes in the cover (they reveal three photos on the first page) and pages of product photos, vintage ads, stills from TV commercials, colored panels and text all mixed up but in a nicely controlled way. There is an index in the back. But, wait! There's more, although this book concentrates on Ronco and the Popeil's you can see a whole load more (dubious) TV advertised products in 'As Seen On TV' by Lou Harry and Sam Stall.<br /><br />Don't forget: never say battery operated, it's cordless electric.

I must say though that as designs they are all uniformly uninspiring (except for Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1927 and The Green Pastures, 1936) but what they lack in stylish graphics and type they make up for in an exuberance of color, flamboyant images plus huge angled titles and cast lists, all to put across what the movie was about and pull the customer into a downtown picture palace.     Donald Bogle writes a short essay on the history of  black movies but strangely makes no comment about the posters or who produced them.  John Kisch, who collects black cast movie posters suggests in his Author's Note that frequently the poster artwork was more interesting than the movie itself.  Get this book if you are into the graphic history of American movies, it covers one small historical part and does it very well.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-12-16

Barbara Norfleet concentrates on a rather under-appreciated aspect of American photography, the local commercial photo studio found in most towns across the country.  This book is an extension of her first book `The Champion Pig', which examined  studio photography from 1929 to 1960.  `When We Liked Ike', with 170 excellent photos, covers the years from 1945.  The author explains how these photos were taken to please those who commissioned them and they basically show the attitudes, values and aspirations of the white middle class.  There are plenty of family gatherings and social events but also examples of outdoor commercial activity, the Florida studio of Joe Steinmetz  produced excellent architectural work like the drive-in hamburger unit on page 126.    Nearly every photo is worth studying for the detail they contain, they are not blurred, grainy or gimmicky, this is a record of what the subject wanted (and paid for) not how the photographer felt about the subject.  The only details provided about the images are the photographer's name and sometimes a date, this lack of information can be annoying at times, page eighty-seven shows a woman smoking a pipe, her head surrounded by smoke, just why did Jack Gould take this picture in 1946?  Page thirty-three shows a (pin-sharp) photo of a traffic jam in Main Street, Somewhere USA, why was this moment captured for ever?    The book is well designed and printed though I think the cover design is unimaginative and the photo (two senior citizens in swimwear enjoying a smoke) rather inappropriate to sum up post-war America.  As well as the fascinating `The Champion Pig', `Wedding' is another Barbara Norfleet book using work of the local studio photographer.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-12-15

Mr Kohler presents two hundred and fifty covers (from his large collection) which he rightly thinks show the best of album design in the early years of the LP. He features eight artist/designers who created some of the most distinctive work in cover art. Two of them are my favorites, David Stone Martin who gave Norman Granz's Clef label some beautiful cover illustrations (twenty are shown) and Reid Miles who created the east coast look to Blue Note Records. Unfortunately only four of his covers are shown but you can see dozens more in the two books by Graham Marsh: [[ASIN:185585919X The Cover Art of Blue Note Records]]  and  [[ASIN:3283003424 The Cover Art of Blue Note Records, Vol.2]]. The other six designers range from the unique illustrations of RCA's Jim Flora to the work of Swiss born designer Erik Nitsche and his semi abstract work for Decca. Record companies are also featured and you can see the beginnings of the Capitol Records house style, I think they were the only major company to produce consistently well designed covers with excellent photography and typography.    Though all these covers are interesting to look at I don't think too many work as complete design units, that is image and text complement each other, mostly they are images with text added later. One cover that I like is on page eighty-one, it shows a file-card box and the albums title, 'Guide to Jazz' is typed on a card which is resting against the box, the tabs of the other cards have musical instruments on them, a simple creative idea that works. Strangely the designer is unknown.    I doubt you will see as good a coverage of the early years of the LP as this (well produced) book but have a look at this title that concentrates on jazz covers from the fifties and sixties, [[ASIN:456850158X Jazz West Coast: Artwork of Pacific Jazz Records]]. It has dozens of examples of creativity on paper twelve inches square, somehow CD covers just can't compete with that.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer image' under the cover.	2002-12-14

A disappointing half-hearted attempt at capturing the essence of Main Street USA. The book's intro suggests this is nostalgia for Fifties America, Norman Rockwell land, a railroad station, Woolworth's, gas stations, soda fountains, barber shop, movie theatre, Post office, volunteer fire department and more. Plenty of scope for visual material but what is presented (in rather flat color) looks like it came out of a stock photo catalogue, there are even three photos of ghost towns from the old west.<BR> <BR>There are a few interesting photos though, pages 44-45 show the Woodstock, Vermont, Town Crier, actually a notice board with the latest goings-on written in chalk, page 26 shows some guys passing the time of day outside a store in Redwoods, California. There should have been a lot more of these sort of photos and some showing the insides of the stores on any Main Street. Throughout the book there are rather dull quotes that are given too much space. The photo and quote credits are given four pages at the back when they should have been on the relevant pages throughout the book.<br />I have a couple of other books that handle the theme so much better, 'Remembering Main Street' by Pat Ross, which covers ten towns across the Nation and their Main Streets and 'Home Towns' by photographer George Tice, wonderful black and white images of Fairmont, Indiana, Dixon, Illinois and Hannibal, Missouri.	2002-12-08

The first copy of Mad I saw was issue 29 in September 1956 (still got it too) and I was hooked.  How could a magazine be so funny and be so spot-on with its satire?  Easy, just employ the `usual gang of idiots' that's how.  I kind of grew out of it when I discovered the National Lampoon, how could a magazine be so funny etc, etc.  But I have always had a soft spot for Mad and this book of covers is a super addition to my back issues and other Mad books.    All 399 (up to November 2000) covers are in this well designed and printed book  Mostly one or two covers to a page sometimes with Frank Jacobs' commentary and with a lot of the latter covers you get to see the preliminary cover roughs.  As the years go by you can see how the covers changed from simple visual gags into ones that are much more graphic and busy because they have to work harder on the newsstand.  The ideas are still very funny after all these years though.  My favorite is issue 35 (October 1957) a wraparound that celebrated the fifth anniversary with a great painting from Norman Mingo showing a few dozen very famous American merchandising characters seated round a dining table, Alfred's at one end grinning.  I would love this as a poster.    I think it is worth mentioning for Mad fans the seven CD-ROM `Totally Mad' set, every page from the issue one thru to December 1998, the interface is very user friendly and the discs have a lot of additional aural and visual surprises.    BTW, Robert Silver's photmosaic book cover, made up from the magazines covers, is stunning.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-11-24

John Quinn's text, in sixty or so pages, is a superficial overview of the last hundred years illustrated with a few vintage porn and burlesque photos, I would have expected to see examples of Tijuana Bibles, burlesque and film posters, men's magazine covers, video boxes, adult web-site home pages etc, etc. Dian Hansen contributes an interesting short postscript on the future of porn.<br />What fills the majority of the book are hundreds of hard-core photos which seem to come from the output of Californian porn producer Leoram (they even have an ad on page 440) Kim Christy I guess has some connection with this company.<br />The book designer, Armando Chitolina from Milan, assumes all this very (interesting) explicit material will bore the readers so he liberally splashes color panels, text and abstract shapes over the photos.<br />So, not really survey on American erotica, more a visual treat on what men and women get up to in the Los Angeles sex biz!	2002-11-22

It is a big book (at a BIG price) weighing TWELVE POUNDS and the landscape format opens up spreads thirty-four inches wide, beatifully printed with English, German and French text.    Each of the thirty-six houses is covered in the same way with:  1 A short introduction by editor Smith  2 The relevant editorial copy from Arts & Architecture magazine about the house.  3 Photos, plans, diagrams, illustrations. Lots of the photos are by the brilliant Jules Shulman and I doubt you will see them this big anywhere else.  4 Color photos of the house today.    Some of houses only have a spread or two (the unbuilt ones) while others have several spreads, Pierre Koenig's famous Stahl House (#22) has twenty pages. I was intriqued by a photo on one of these, it shows the living room with a small table on which are the obligatory selection of magazines, two of these are 'America', the Russian language publication put out in the sixties by the US Information Agency, were these on display when the house was open to the public or did Shulman put them there just for the photo session?    I have given this glorious book only four stars because it is not as complete as it should be, the focus is very narrow, essentially a visual history of the Study Houses and that's it! What is missing is any historical and contemporary background and surely the reason the whole project was important was the influence it had on other architects, house builders, planners, the public and manufactures.     To get a perspective you will have to get Elizabeth Smith's earlier book 'Blueprints for Modern Living' published in conjunction with an exhibition in Los Angeles in 1989-1990. As the sub-title to the book says...'History and Legacy of the Case Study Houses' I found this a marvellous book telling me every thing I wanted to know, though there are only forty-two pages of text and photos on the actual houses. It is a pity that a lot of the information in the remaining 214 pages was not included in this huge volume.    Now that I have the book, where will I put it, who makes bookcases over sixteen inches deep anyway? Maybe I'll just leave it on a table. I bet it will soon pop up in those house interior photos you see in glossy magazines where folk have piles of large art books neatly arranged on their coffee tables, the cover with its black and white diagonal design will make it very visible.

US	43058502	R3N2AEK0HJDHDJ	0393049434	962453153	Long Time Coming: A Photographic Portrait of America, 1935-1943	Books	5	67	70	N	N	Looking backwards	A stunning book of 410 photos from the Farm Security Administration/Office of War Information archives now in the Library of Congress.  This book takes a different approach to the many others which use FSA photos, here you will not see many of those well-known images of poverty in rural areas, the effects of land erosion, the plight of Southern sharecroppers, not even the greatest FSA photo of all (in my view) Dorothea Lange's Migrant Mother but instead a comprehensive and wonderful showing of the ordinary and everyday in American life from 1935 to 1943.    All these fascinating photos are divided into eight sections, City Life, Hard Work, Hometowns, Hill Towns, Coal Towns, Family Farms, Hard Times and Amusements.  Most of them are from 1938 to 1943 so there are few by Walker Evans who left the FSA in 1937 but plenty by Russell Lee, the most prolific FSA photographer.  The photos (well printed on excellent paper) are presented one to a page with a caption, photographer's name and date centred below.  Because these are FSA  images they depict a very detailed picture of everyday life and in 1941 when the US joined the Second World War it was decided to expand the coverage to record the war effort and life in general.  This is the main reason I like the book plus the eighty-two photos never published before.    Between the eight photo sections author Lesy writes (in a very honest way) various essays about Roy Stryker, who ran of the FSA and how he organised the photographers work through his exacting shooting scripts (these were partially inspired by Robert Lynd and his 1925 book, `Middletown' based on Muncie, Indiana which turns out to be average small town USA, tough luck Peoria, Illinois!) how this huge file of images was distributed to the media, correspondence between Stryker and the photographers and more.  I found one section (pages 230 to 235) called `The Middletown Spirit' very intriguing, it is a list of the things that the folks of  `Middletown' (or small towns anywhere) believed in and as well as the goodness that one would expect it also reflects an alarming collection of deeply conservative beliefs, ethnic prejudice and a Horatio Alger like deference towards business.  The back of the book lists all the negative numbers so you can order prints from the Library of Congress and in fact see 60,000 photos from the FSA/OWI collection on the Library's `American Memory' website.    Because of what these photographs show, the quality of presentation and production, I think this will become the definitive reference book for the period.  A glorious reminder of the American spirit.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-11-20

A pleasant enough short history of bowling, giving just enough detail to be interesting without getting too technical though in some cases I would have appreciated more information, in particular the development of the automatic pinsetter (surely the one item that pushed the sport into the big-time) and the architecture of bowling lanes, the work of the architectural company Powers, Daly & DeRosa helped pull in the customers to the flamboyant lanes of the fifties.<br />The book is a neat square shape (seven by seven inches) and well produced with over a hundred pictures but before you order your copy you have to know that (amazingly) none of the pictures have captions! Some of them clearly are just graphics to help the design along but I counted fifty-two that really should have some explanation for the reader, for instance page eleven shows actor Telly Savalas just about to bowl, when was it taken and where? Page forty-seven shows the outside of the streamline Tower Bowl in San Diego (designed by Charlie Lee) I think readers should be told this in a caption, page ninety-six has a bowling championship in progress, where, when? I'm surprised that the publisher did not pick up this rather fundamental flaw in the books presentation.<br />A book I enjoyed more than 'Bowled Over' is 'Bowl-O-Rama' by Thomas Steele, essentially a visual history with hundreds of pictures (all with captions) and short introductions to the nine chapters. Oh and the cover shows part of a bowling ball with three holes punched right though the stiff cardboard.	2002-11-17

A super-size dazzling collection of 1000 digital game heroes, all in color and beautifully printed. Not only the heroes and scenes from the games but many have development drawings too. Each hero has a page introduction (in three languages) and some technical info about the platform, developer, issue date and more, then a page devoted to the character, usually as a cut-out on a white background (these are not screen shots but taken from the original digital development) followed by scenes from the game. Naturally with just over six-hundred pages it is very comprehensive and can get a bit overwhelming. Divided into ten sections, 1 Fearless Heroes, 2 Fighting Heroes, 3 Funny Heroes, 4 Heroes of the Future, 5 Kings of Action, 6 Legends of Video Games, 7 Licensed Heroes, 8 Magical Heroes, 9 Sexy Heroes and lastly, Strange Heroes, you might find the placing of some characters in these divisions a bit arbitrary. The back of the book has a game and a platform index so you can flip to your favorites. <br />Though the book is quite stunning visually I found it hard work reading it, mainly because the typography is not very user friendly, for instance, the page numbers are turned sideways and positioned in the top right-hand corners of each left-hand page, the games technical information is also turned sideways, in small capitals, and printed in black and white on darkish panels. Perhaps most annoying are the introductions, this text, fortunately only a few lines deep, stretches across the page in lines 160mm wide with the English printed in various colors, lucky French and German readers get black type.<br />So apart from the silly typography I think game fans you will love this huge book, a printed record to remind you of all the (enjoyable) hours and sore thumbs endured in chasing the heroes around the screen and watching the bad guys win or lose.	2002-11-10

An absolute bargain for the price, 1000 pages and over 2000 color photos (and some drawings). What I like about this book is the very comprehensive coverage of contemporary architecture, not only the well-known, Petronas Towers, Kuala Lumpur for instance, but the (perhaps) unknown, Grand Valley Woman's Prison in Ontario or the phosphate plant in Nordgraben, Germany or the Scottsdale, Arizona East Couplet Street urban improvement. <br />There are five basic chapters, Urban planning and transport, Cultural facilities, Leisure facilities, Public buildings and institutions and finally Homes, these five areas are divided into thirty-nine sections in all.  Each building gets a spread with usually one big and two, three or four smaller photos and some have architect's drawings (unfortunately the books small size means most of these are too tiny) a detailed technical description and a couple of hundred words about the building. For some odd reason the book does not have a building or architect index.<br />This would be an ideal book for a student thinking of becoming an architect because it shows the very wide range of building styles that require design solutions.  For others, like me, it is a super record of some of the best recent architecture around the world.	2002-11-09

Rather than turn out another normal size book on Route 66 the publishers had the great idea of making it pocket size, four by six inches, landscape and with FOUR-HUNDRED all-color pages. I predict that this will be the standard book for those who want to make the trip. Each of the eight states that 66 goes through has a chapter, they start with a simple map, comments about landscape and climate, then the text details what to look for along the way, with the help of historical and contemporary photos, a linear map with places and mileage goes across the top of all of these pages.     Between all the route pages are some lovely spreads of Route 66 Americana which repeat themselves throughout the book, Route Food (pages 174-175 has Red-Hot BBQ Beef Ribs) Transport (168-169 has a 1936 Harley-Davidson) Music of the Road (Woody Guthrie on 156-157) and Famous Sites (Wigwam Village, Holbrook, AZ, on 294-295). The books production is excellent, good choice of photos, well laid out pages (a tip of the hat to designer Phillip Clucas) with colourful graphics behind the text on most of them. The back has a book list, useful resources guide (including websites) and index.     I recently reviewed 'The Final Cut Route 66' by German photographer Gerd Kittel. Eighty-three wonderful photographs of what he saw along 66 and I think it is the perfect book to complement Nick Freeth's travelogue. Kittel has the knack of producing really good color in his photos. Both books do justice to a unique and fascinating bit of America.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-10-20

I first came across Kittel's work in 1986 when I bought his `Southwest USA' and the following year `A New England Autumn'.  As well as photographing the landscape he has an eye for capturing man-made America and as a foreigner that does not mean he searches out the ugly and the squalid.  What I find so impressive about his work is the color and depth he manages to capture, you are really there looking at the scene as he saw it.  The only other photographer I know of who also captures color in the same way is Stephen Shore in his 1982 book `Uncommon Places'    Kittel's photo essay of Route 66, in eighty-three (well printed) images captures the sights he found along the way.  It starts with a spread of the morning rush-hour on a corner of Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue in Chicago and ends with a picture of Santa Monica Boulevard and Ocean Avenue in California, the photos in-between  show motels, gas stations, shops and frequently the people who run them, road signs, landscapes and more.  Actually just the sort of photos that you would expect to see in a book about Route 66 but not until now with this quality and beauty.  Some of these images are quite stunning, page sixty-one shows the Munger Moss motel in Labanon, Missouri, with its huge neon sign, page sixty-four has a near dusk  image of the Boots Motel in Carthage, Missouri, the neon strips creating a glow on the sidewalk, page 157 shows a street corner in Barstow, with at least ten commercial signs disappearing into the distance to the left of the photo    In five sections between the photos pages author Freddy Langer's words cover the history of the highway in one paragraph decorative blocks.  I think you can read  better histories elsewhere and fortunately the text pages don't take up too much space.  There are several general books about Route 66 but I got one recently that I feel is an excellent complement to Gerd Kittel's book, check out `Travelling Route 66' by Nick Freeth.  The publishers had the great idea of making it small (about the size of a postcard) but with four hundred, all color pages. It is a travelogue, state by state, with maps, of what you can see and do if you drive the whole 2,250 miles of America's most famous road.  So get out there and get your kicks.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-10-16

Yet another collection of Farm Security Administration photographs devoted to a State, this time Indiana.  I already have similar books of FSA photos, titled `Chicago and Downstate', `A Southern Illinois Album', `A Kentucky Album', `Picturing Minnesota' and  `Far from Main Street', (about New Mexico) but I don't think this latest book is as good as these.  The ten chapters adequately cover the years from 1935 to 1943 with an emphasis on agriculture and I think these are the weakest photos.  The chapter called People and Places with sixteen photos of small town Indiana life was best, exterior shots of stores with their wares and signage (signs, ads and anything typographic was a big thing with FSA photographers) interior shots, main streets, people talking and relaxing or eating in a diner.<br />Each chapter has a short introduction and all the pictures are photographer credited, captioned, dated and usefully they have the Library of Congress negative number, a  comprehensive book list is in the back of the book.  I found the photos a little grey because they are printed in a dot screen (133) that does not do justice to the quality of the images and quite a few could be better trimmed.  Despite this `Back Home Again' is worth having especially if you live in Indiana and want a visual record of the day just before yesterday.	2002-10-15

The title of this marvellous book is a little misleading, it should be 'The Modern Architectural Photographs of Ezra Stoller'. The actual title 'Modern Architecture' implies that it might be a history of the subject. There are 164 large, beautifully printed, photos of what he considers his best work and 223 smaller photos, many of which have his (fascinating) comments about the architects and the buildings. The majority of the photos are in black and white (thirty-four in color) and somehow this seems as it should be, mid-century Modernist architecture has a visual simplicity that works best in tones of grey and black, I feel.    William Saunders essay explains how Stoller originally trained as an architect and this is probably the reason why he can take such stunning photos of buildings. One reason I like his work is because the main object of the photo always seems naturally framed within the photo area, another is that many of the photos have strong shapes which create an abstract feel to them, helped, of course, by being in black and white. Even when curves are involved Stoller still delivers, two knockout photos of Saarinen's TWA terminal (pages 120-121) remind me of the chromed tube sculpture of Jose DeRivera.    A couple of book design flaws I found slightly annoying, firstly: some of the page numbers are missing on the three commentary sections where Stoller comments on the architects and buildings and secondly: none of the captions indicate when the photos were taken. Although not a design flaw I would have expected to see at least one photo of Mr Stoller in this book, the blank space opposite the title page would have been the obvious place.    Stoller seemed to have concentrated on photographing modern buildings in the east of the US, the west was covered by Julius Shulman and you can see some lovely examples of his work, especially private houses, in 'Julius Shulman. Architecture and its Photography', edited by Peter Gossel.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-10-13

Needless to say they vary enormously depending on the animals diet and lifestyle.  <br />This quirky title is another addition to my (slowly) expanding shelf of bizarre books, it already has `A Handbook on Hanging' by Charles Duff (London 1928) `Frog Raising for Pleasure and Profit' by Albert Broel (New Orleans 1937) and `Car Crashes' by Mell Kilpatrick (Koln 2000) this last book is from the same publisher as 'Cacas'.	2002-10-06

As the short introduction says `Rarely has one geographic region been the focus of such intense visual interest as the state of California'  This well produced (and inexpensive) paperback manages to capture the feel of the new Eden.  The pictorial material is mainly from the 1930s to 1950s and includes a wide range of printed ephemera (a Sunkist orange wrapper to NBC Radio City, Hollywood, Studio Tour brochure for example) and I liked the nine examples of three-dimensional maps, unfortunately shown too small to really appreciate the detail.  All the favorites of the State have a showing, the Giant Redwoods, Death Valley, Hollywood, Dude Ranches, San Francisco etc. The images are illustrative rather than photographic and this is why I think the book works so well, you can see how commercial artists have been allowed portray California as big, bold and bright.	2002-10-02

As a publication designer I can appreciate the care and thought that went into this stunning and unique book. Andrew Roth, in the introduction, explains his brilliant idea, 'The basis for my selection was simple. Foremost, a book had to be a thoroughly considered production; the content, the mise-en-page, choice of paper stock, reproduction quality, text, typeface, binding, jacket design, scale - all of the elements had to blend together to fit naturally within the whole'. I would agree with all of that (I have eight of the 101) and also his selection of the photographic books which mostly exemplify what he was searching for.     Not all of these criteria apply to each book though. The author has wisely included all the covers to his selection and I don't think there is a single book jacket shown that I would class as excellence in design, that is, the title and image working together as one to sum up the contents for a potential purchaser. Mostly they are the usual publishers' marketing department output, a single photo or image with some (bland) typography added. Strangely the cover to 'The Book Of 101 Books' is rather dull and typographically conservative.     Another area where, I think, many of the books fall short of the author's criteria is the lack of captioning. Many of the reproduced spreads clearly just have the photos on the page with no information for the reader. Why do publishers (and possibly even the photographers) think that beautiful, imaginative and stimulating photos don't need some textual explanation on the same page? I recently bought 'Dream Street' by Eugene Smith, an excellent collection of photos taken in 1955 of life in Pittsburgh, virtually all of the photos make me ask \\"What's going on here\\" and I have to constantly turn to the back of the book to read a caption, even more annoying because there is plenty of space on each page for them. This lack of a caption on the same page as the photo seems a common fault with many photographic books.    The author says his goal was not to compile a selection of rare or precious books, just great ones and the 101 chosen reflect that vision, starting in 1907, with the twenty volume 'The North American Indian' and ending in 1996 with David LaChapelle's 'LaChapelle Land', these two books are a world apart but nevertheless have elements in common that the author was searching for. The other ninety-nine books show the amazing diversity that a photographer's eye, light and chemicals can do to the world. As well as the spreads from the books there are six essays dealing with photographic book publishing, all of them interesting and thought provoking, Richard Benson (no relation) writes a very succinct explanation of book printing techniques over the last hundred years.    Handling this sumptuous book, turning over the pages of the beautiful paper it is printed on, looking at the images (printed with a screen well over two hundred dots to the inch) it is a good example of why books will not vanish in this expanding digital age.     BTW: another reviewer has commented that 'The Book Of 101 Books' is one of the best designed books of recent years, beautiful as it is I don't think I would go that far and I'll not be adding it to my Listmania: 'My favorite well-designed books'. Editorially I think there are a couple of errors, firstly, in the bibliographic details there is no mention of a books pagination, and secondly, all the text about a book is in one paragraph, clearly a mistake when some of the pieces are several hundred words long. I also think the layouts have an annoying fault, each of the 101 books starts on a spread and the left-hand page displays the books cover within a text wrap of two columns, this second column frequently looks a line short because the writer's initials are ranged right on the last line instead of occupying a new line or even hanging them in the margin, in bold face, for instance.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-10-02

Goulart's history of  comics Golden Age, roughly mid Thirties to the late Forties, is adequate though you can read more in his previous book `Over 50 Years of American Comic Books' but it is the four hundred covers reproduced that I think will interest readers more.  Page after page of superheroes battling crime and or evil in dazzling 100 Magenta plus 100 Yellow, that's the printers term for the vibrant red that the comics biz could not do without.  All these covers had to compete on the newsstand and the more 100Y+100M the better it seems, page 130 has the cover of The Human Torch (1943) leaping off the page, it couldn't get any brighter.<br /><br />I have always been rather critical of Collector Press books, they always seem a bit over designed but this one is great, each of the sixteen chapters starts on a spread one page of which is a huge color blow-up of part of a picture, many of the spreads just have covers and captions on them and the designers have resisted the temptation to angle or overlap the covers.  The typography, layouts and printing are excellent.  There are two chapters devoted to some of the great comic artists of the period, Everett, Fine, Patenaude, Kirby, Schomburg, Ricca and Cole. The last chapter has a (very) brief look at  what is called \\"Good girl art\\", presenting heroines in as provocative a way as possible  and you can't get more provocative than Matt Baker's April 1948 cover of Phantom Lady, sales must have soared!<br /><br />If you want to see more covers have a look at the two volume `The Photo-Journal Guide to Comic Books' by Ernst and Mary Gerber, more than 21,000 beautifully printed on gloss paper (another two volumes covers 7,000 Marvel comics).	2002-09-24

The contents of Robert Harrison's pulp girlie titles, Beauty Parade, Eyeful, Titter, Wink, Whisper and Flirt form the contents of this book They were published between 1942 and 1958 and they mostly showed black and white photos of scantily clad ladies (Harrison did not approve of nudity) in slapstick situations, with copy written to accompany the photos as puerile and clichéd ridden as you will ever read. These photos are all very tame by today's standards. The book reproduces covers and spreads (and some of the down-market ads) from these magazines.<BR> <BR>The contents of these titles are basically trash but they do have one thing of interest, their covers, these were paintings rather than photos. Pin-up artist Peter Driben painted hundreds of covers for the six titles and dozens are shown in this book, some other pin-up artists are included as well.<BR> <BR>Before you rush out and buy the book you need to know that all the covers and the spreads have been sized slightly bigger than the book. This does not matter too much with the reproduced spreads but all the covers have been ruined because of this enlargement, the title logos and coverlines run of the side of the page. <br />Two better Taschen cheesecake titles are 'The Rottenberg Collection', seven hundred pages of American pin-ups (mostly nudes) from the forties to the sixties from the collection of Mark Rottenberg. European pin-ups are covered in 'Serge Jacques' by Gilles Neret. Both these titles are far superior to `1000 Pin-Ups' BTW, the book was originally published under the title of 'The Best of American Girlie Magazines' by the same author.	2002-09-22

This rather unusual arrangement was because most copies were on subscription to the folks who ran the nation's business and any newsstand sales were a bonus. The fact that it did not have to use its cover to compete with other magazines for sales allowed the various Art Editors to go for great illustrations from the leading graphic artists of the day.<br /><br />All the covers from the first issue in February 1930 to December 1950 are shown in this lovely designed and printed book, either one to a page or four to a page (I felt the four to a page ones could have been a little bigger) and each year starts on a page with a few news items and some stats about business. The magazine's owner Henry Luce chose Tom Cleland to art edit the first issue and he came up with a rather ugly format for the covers, a double frame devise, the logo was in one and the illustration in another, I think this heavy framing design rather spoils the early covers and fortunately by 1942 it was dropped.<br /><br />Daniel Okrent explains in his short introduction that cover artists were chosen for their creativity, some of the best graphic artists commissioned included Fred Ludekens, Erik Nitsche, A M Cassandre, Joseph Binder, George Gusti, John Atherton and Lester Beal. Although artists from the fine arts were also used, such as Ben Shahn, Fernand Leger, Charles Sheeler and Diego Rivera I don't think these covers work as well because their work is not suited to the constraints of commercial graphics.<br /><br />By 1950 Fortune, now a very successful business monthly and making Henry Luce even richer, changed its editorial focus into a magazine that Luce said should \\"...assist in the successful development of American business enterprise at home and abroad.\\" Covers now had to work harder as other business weeklies and monthlies all competed for the CEO's time and the luxury of a stunning cover image for its own sake had gone. This lovely book shows you the best of Fortune covers.	2002-09-22

This all-color paperback shows a fascinating glimpse of Mexico using everyday printed ephemera.  Considering the huge nation to the north of the country I found it intriguing that this material has its own distinctive national look and owes nothing to the graphic styles of the US.  Apart from the three pages of introduction (in English, German and French) at the start of the book there is no other text, like other Taschen `Icon' books it is devoted to images.<br />The range of material shown, stretching back to the thirties, is impressive, magazine covers, bottle and can labels, matchbook covers, cigarette packets, posters (fortunately only eight pages devoted to the old favorite, bullfighting) travel brochures, menus, paperback covers, ads, calendar paintings and more. Apart from a few photos all the material is illustrative (mainly paintings) and depending on its use the work ranges from the excellent to the rather amateurish.<br />This could be a very useful little book if you need some quick graphic reference to Mexicana and even Latin America.	2002-09-15

If you stand at a bookshop cash register you will most likely see `Taxi Driver Wisdom' along with `The Tao of Elvis' or `The Little Book of Belches' or `You and the True Meaning of Crop Circles'.  Publishers love these little volumes placed as they are near the register for casual purchase.  Why anyone should think that taxi drivers have any great insight on life is beyond me, mostly average guys doing an average job. Like barbers they deal with a captive public so this book could just as easily be called `Barber Shop Wisdom'.  <br />I was expecting something much funnier and wry instead of the shallow observations that fill these pages.  Another reviewer has referred to \\"lots of bumper sticker wisdom\\",  quite right, once through the carwash and it's gone.  All these taxi driver `thoughts' are dressed up in a pretty sumptuous package though, thick black hardback covers and each spread has a black-and-white street scene photo on the left with a bright yellow page on the right for the type, all on glossy paper. The book comes with the ultimate pretension, a faux yellow silk bookmark, just in case the readers lose their place in the unnumbered pages.<br />I'll end this review with a thought from Jean De La Bruyere (1645-1696) `The exact contrary of what is generally believed is often the truth'.  Now that's what I call wisdom!	2002-09-15

I bought the first edition of this book years ago and what attracted me to it was the very accessible way it was produced, it just looked so inviting.  Francis Ching writes about technical matters in a simple straightforward style and Cassandra Adams illustrations are a joy to look at.  She produced the entire book (except for the bar-code) by hand, cover, title page, contents, index and drew over a thousand technical illustrations and even hand wrote the detailed captions.  This latest updated edition uses the same illustrations but the text is now typeset in a typeface (Tekton, I think) very similar to her handwritten style.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said this is not a book for the DIY handyman but a guide to construction basics, chapters deal with the site, the building, foundations, floors, walls, roofs, moisture protection, doors and windows, finish work, mechanical and electrical, materials.  The thirty-two page Appendix gives addition technical information, followed by a ten page index.<br /><br />I do have one very minor criticism of this latest edition though, for some odd reason the publisher's have decided to print all the illustrations in a tint of black which detracts them from their original beauty. However this will not stop readers from enjoying and learning from a unique looking book that can hardly be improved on.  A masterpiece.	2002-09-15

Dozens of color pictures (mainly sourced from adverts) of the future created when optimism was in the air and one was led to believe that science would conquer most frontiers and life was going to be one long continuous weekend.  Editor Jim Heimann has wisely restricted his choice of images from the mid-thirties to the start of the fifties, so they picture a very streamlined future. Amongst all the pictures are twenty-three super covers from the science and mechanics type monthly magazines (some enterprising publisher should do a coffee-table book of these with their striking cover paintings) several pages of comic-book type illustrations and thirteen intriguing ads, designed in 1945, from the Bohn aluminium company showing some wonderful streamlined vehicles.<br /><br />Future transportation has the biggest showing but there are future homes, offices, suburbs, schools, space and everyday living.  Bruce McCall sums up the feel of the pictures in an interesting introduction called `Futures that never arrived'. Other than his intro there is no other text so if you want to read about past predictions of the American future have a look at `Yesterday's Tomorrows' by Joseph Corn and Brian Horrigan, it is one of the best books I have read on the subject and it includes plenty of excellent pictures.  Worth a look also is  `Out of Time' by Norman Brosterman, it covers the same subject but I found it historically too broad in scope, some of the pictures date back to the eighteen hundreds.<br /><br />With 'Future Perfect' my brighter tomorrow has arrived today.	2002-09-12

I expect this sold a few copies in Levittown but if you want a pictorial history of this fascinating suburb, as I did, forget this book.  Unfortunately nearly every one of the two hundred photos is either blurred, soft focused or not even relevant. It is as if the originals were all photocopied and these copies sent to the printer.  The inflexible layout means all the photos are either one or two columns wide and printed with a 133 screen on soft paper does not help either.  I can only guess that the authors wanted to produce the book as cheaply as possible, nearly all the photos are copyright free (I assume) and credited to the Levittown Public Library Collection.<br /><br />The most interesting chapter to me was the one dealing with the construction of Levittown, even with the awful photos you can see the wood frame construction of the houses, the cement block floors with the heating pipes and there are several pictures of the Cape Cod and Ranch type units which make up the 17,500 houses in the suburb.  In the back of the book are several photos (and these, taken by co-author Tova Navarra, are probably the best in the book) of the remodelling that most of the houses have gone through depending on the owner's needs.<br /><br />Plenty of photos show life in Levittown but as they are no better than snap-shots they don't do justice to the people shown, the place or the reader.  All very disappointing because having just read Barbara Kelly's excellent book [[ASIN:0791412881 Expanding the American Dream (Suny Series in the New Cultural History): Building and Rebuilding Levittown]], I think there is an opportunity for some publisher to do a well designed coffee-table pictorial history with good photos of the houses, their interiors, construction, community life, house blueprints, maps and more.

Yes it was, according to Karel Ann Marling in her book `As Seen On TV: The Visual Culture of Everyday Life in the 1950s', advertisers deliberately made food garish and bright and forced a contrast between objects and backgrounds.  For instance, a pink and white cake would be placed on a green satin tablecloth.  There are plenty of examples like this in `Kitchen Kitsch', either paintings (a chance for commercial artist to use even brighter colors) or photographs.<br />The majority of the illustrations come from the forties and fifties. My favorites are the paintings of jello, turned out from a mould, streamlined with highlights and looking just like Emerald City from the movie, `The Wizard of Oz'.   Not only pictures of food but recipe book covers, can and box labels, period ads and more. All the pictures are in color and as this is a Taschen `Icon' book there is no text or information about the pictures but editor Jim Heimann has created a fun book about yesteryears grub.<br />If you have the stomach for it have a look at `The Gallery of Regrettable Food' by James Lileks.  His book has very similar pictures but he uses them to write some very funny and biting text about food fads of the fifties and the book is a treat to look at as well.<BR>.	2002-08-29

Americans, living as they do in a republic, seem to have an ongoing fascination with the British monarchy, a small elite of non-elected leaders who indulge a life of privilege and affluence and in Robert Opie's super book you can follow the history of the Royals from Victorian times to the recent Queen's Golden Jubilee. Although the book only has sixty-two pages it opens up to spreads twenty-one by fifteen inches and there are over 1,500 items to look at.    Opie's Scrapbooks (there are eight others) all follow the same style, each themed spread is a collection of printed ephemera and related material, usually presented as one carefully arranged still-life photo with some text explaing the background to the items shown. For instance, the spread on Queen Elizabeth's 1953 Coronation has five magazine covers, postage stamps, a ball-point pen, seven candy packages, six children's books, a pack of playing cards, a London Transport subway map and several other items, they all have a reference to the Coronation printed on them.     The events covered include coronations, weddings, jubilees, births and deaths and it does get a bit overwhelming with so much colourful material to look at but that is one of the joys of these books, you can keep coming back and discover something for the first time.

The book most often quoted in the bibliography of books about Levittown is Herbert Gans' 'The Levittowners', now having just read Barbara Kelly's book I think it should be considered the definitive study. I found Gans book overlong, with a rather dry writing style (why are sociology books like that?) plus he was writing about the third suburb, in New Jersey, built by the Levitt Brothers, a township that reverted to its original name of Willingboro.<br /><br />Kelly writes in an easy accessible style and in nine chapters covers all the things I wanted to know. Chapter six was particularly interesting as it concentrated on the alterations three families made to their houses according to changing domestic circumstances. Most of the original ranch style houses (built in 1949-1951) have been changed and expanded over the years because, as one resident put it, the houses had no real storage space. In other chapters Kelly covers construction, design, the politics of the planned community, housing and the Government (policies dictated from Washington were crucial to the success of post-war suburbs) criticism from the creative community and architectural critics, naturally they did not favor such uniform housing communities (but how do they get round the fact that most of the folks living in Levittown liked it?) and finally in a Postscript the author brings the story into the nineties.<br /><br />Excellent though the book is I do have some criticism, nothing to do with the author though. I found the very comprehensive and fascinating notes (seventy-four pages of them) in the back of the book should really have been made into footnotes at the bottom of each relevant page, it really is annoying to keep turning to the back to read a note, but first you have to remind yourself which chapter you are reading. There are several house plans included and they are rather crudely rendered in CAD with dreadful typography.<br /><br />The book has twenty-five or so photos (mostly of the houses) and I think it is about time some publisher did a pictorial history of the place, I have a copy of 'Levittown: the first 50 years' by Margaret Ferrer and Tova Navarra but it is a very amateurish looking book with badly reproduced photos no better than snaps (which many are). I'm sure plenty of the 17,500 households in Levittown would buy a coffee table book about their history.<br /><br />Get Barbara Kelly's book if you want a first-class study of Levittown, the definitive suburb.	2002-08-26

Author Charles Phoenix, while in a thrift shop, came across a box of  35mm slides and he became hooked on collecting other peoples discarded transparencies.  Unfortunately most of the 117 chosen for his book should have remained discarded.  Loosely based on a trip around America, (mostly taken in the fifties) they can be divided into two types, the straightforward record of a tourist site with aunt Bessie (or whoever) posing and the personal photos of an individual or group.  This second selection produces the weakest photos because you don't have a clue about why the scene was captured on film.    Amateur photos are precious and personal to those who took them but of marginal interest to anyone else and also these photos, for whatever reason, had been junked by someone.  Making them large, one to a page, with the date and a few pithy words, surrounded by too much white space does not make a very interesting book.  This really would have been fascinating,  I think, if there had been lots more, made smaller and perhaps laid out in a collage format with some road maps, tourist trinkets and other printed ephemera on the page plus a much more funnier commentary.   Columnist James Lileks did it with 'The Gallery of Regrettable Food', a collection of ordinary food photos from fifties consumer ads and recipe books plus his own wry way with words produced a very funny book.	2002-08-25

Individually these covers are very dull as graphic designs but put 150 in a book and they become interesting.  As the author says in the intro, the paperback romance has come a long way.  For years the covers of this literary genre had a dominant painting, predictably of the heroine, mediocre typography for the title, blurb and author's name.    By the seventies things had changed for the better and covers took on the full force of the Marketing Division, image space was reduced to make way for expressive typography  (some of it very good too) die-cut holes, foil stamping, embossing, fluorescent inks, thermography and varied paper stock.    Unfortunately there is only one example of the contemporary look ('Hearts Aflame' by Johanna Lindsey) in the 150 shown.  Mostly they are American covers from the forties to the mid-sixties, some from Canada and a few from Mills and Boon the main British romance publisher.  Each of the nine chapters has a page of intro text printed on slightly yellowing paper, leading into the covers, a nice touch on these intro pages is the turned over top right-hand corner creating a bookmark, as one does with inexpensive books.  Some of the covers also have the back  shown and you can read the clichéd copy written to convince the casual book browser that they really do want to know what happened next.    This is worthwhile addition to my popular culture book collection and if you want more have a look at the six hundred covers in Richard Lupff's `The Great American Paperback', a book of coffee-table proportions covering all genres but which I found rather disappointing because of its sloppy production.

Alain Silver has already written the definitive book on the subject with his (and Elizabeth Ward) `Film Noir: An encyclopaedic reference to the American style' and now with `The Noir Style' he has written the definitive book about the look of these movies.    Most critics agree that style was one of the main elements of this genre and Paul Schrader went further to suggest that noir style was working out the conflict visually.  Where would this kind of movie be without its deep shadows and expressive lighting?  With over two hundred production stills the authors explore the various characteristics and meanings of this essentially American art form.  What makes the book so wonderful for me, apart from the excellent design by Bernard Schleifer, are the stills, mostly large one to a page and beautifully printed as 175 screen  duotones, they leap off the page.  Each photo has a very comprehensive caption.     As well as the seven chapters there are several spreads called  `Motif' where certain visual treatments are examined in more detail, prison bars, dream and flashback, face and gesture, sexual debasement, night and the wheel and one I thought particularly interesting about photographer Weegee (his real name was Arthur Fellig and he got his obscure nickname from his job, in the twenties, at The New York Times, where he worked in the photo darkrooms removing excess water from prints before they were dried, he did this with a squeegee) he covered New York city for various tabloid papers and his style was a photographic version of the noir movies.  Page forty-seven shows one of his photos of a dead man on a city  pavement, wearing a blood soaked shirt, over the page is a still of Kirk Douglas playing dead from the movie `Out of the Past', they actually have very little in common, one is sanitised reel life the other is real life.    `The Noir Style' could not be any better and with Silver's `Film Noir' encyclopaedia  you will have a very full account of this fascinatingmovie genre.  One other noir film book I have enjoyed is `Dark City' by Eddie Muller, a detailed text and picture study.  A neat touch is that Muller's written the book in the language style of the hardboiled private eye books of the forties...all three books hit the bull's eye!    ***FOR A LOOK INSIDE click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-08-11

What a neat idea to produce a paperback that relates the tales of folk who were actually passengers on the great streamliners of the past.  Author Mike Schafer managed to cover a lot of miles (and consume plenty of food in the dining cars too) on these trains and his travels take up most of the text, various side-bars give others a chance to tell of their streamline rail adventures.  All very interesting but what let the book down for me (apart from the bland predictable layout) was the poor picture selection and the quality of those chosen, too many are soft-focus, blurred, or not really relevant    In the acknowledgement  the author praises Bob Johnson for having the foresight to photograph the interiors of these trains but his photos are no better than snaps that belong in a photo album and not really good enough to appear in print.  If they had to be used maybe a couple of spreads made to look like a scrapbook with hand-written comments would have solved the problem.  I think the best visual items in the book are the brochure covers and ads put out by the railroads to promote their trains.  <br />If you are interested in streamline trains the author (and Joe Welsh) have produced much better books, I would suggest `Classic American Streamliners', 160 pages, or best of all, `The Art of the Streamliner' a hardcover 144 page book which (amazingly) costs not much more than `Streamliner Memories'.	2002-08-06

There are over 3500 covers (in color) from the start of the last century and they are all one and a half inches by two inches, actually they could have been a bit bigger by reducing the generous margins round each cover.<br /><br />Despite the small size there is plenty to enjoy in this well printed book. All the Rockwell's and Leyendecker's are here and into the forties and fifties you can follow Albert Staele's cover paintings of his spaniel Butch, or the regular winter snow scene covers painted by John Clymer. My favourite is Stevan Dohanos, he seemed to delight in cramming in as much detail as possible, offering reader's a reassurance of the familiar and everday. Some publisher should do a book of his Post covers.<br /><br />I was interested to see the covers of the short-lived new look Post from September 61 to June 62, these were created by the famous designer Herb Lubalin but his creative efforts did not impress Middle America and the cover and inside look returned to the regular style. I always thought they looked great and I would love to have these 37 issues in my Post collection (send me an email if you have them)<br /><br />From late 1962 the Post covers were almost all photographic, just like any other mass market magazine and the last weekly issue came out on February 8 1969. This book is a visual record of a unique American publication, just have your magnifying glass handy to enjoy the experience.	2002-08-03

The majority of customers' reviews favor `Economy of Errors' and rightly so, it has some very funny writing in it. So why does it look so dreadful?  It seems to me that the really successful media orientated funny stuff is a crafted combination of words and visuals.  The Onion's `Our Dumb Century' book was brilliant because the words were put in the context and style of front pages from the past, the Modern Humorist's `Rough Draft: Pop culture the way it almost was' would be nowhere near as funny if they did not pay meticulous attention to the everyday items they copied and then changed slightly. Everyone remembers the National Lampoon, their wicked parodies worked because they looked just like the real magazines, comic strips, advertisements etc.<br />The same goes for SatireWire, they need to work at creating the media look of the New Economy. A start has been made, the nine front covers of BusinessMonth Weekly in this book have a slight professional look but the rest of the book, with its sloppy layouts, typography and badly cropped photos spoilt it for me.  I think readers should expect better.	2002-08-03

I was expecting great things from this colourful paperback, the title suggests that it would be in the same style as the three volume `Boring Postcards' (UK, USA and Germany) by British photographer Martin Parr, each page has a life-size postcard, including the white border with caption, or sometimes the card would have a deckle edge.  Very few of these cards are boring of course, as they tend to show things from the recent past.  They can also be valuable, have a look at any postcard seller's website and you'll see `boring' cards of fifties motels selling for some dollars.  So that card you have been using all these years as a bookmark and showing Hank's Garage and Lube Shop in downtown Pigs Knuckle, Arkansas could be worth something.<br />Unfortunately `Bizarro Postcards' does not deliver because there is no indication that they are postcards.  All the photos are either whole page or two butted together and they all bleed of the edge of the page, the book is really just a collection of photos that could just as easily be cut out of magazines.  Clearly though, some are obviously postcards, the motel ones that have small inset photos of the bedrooms, the views of shops or restaurants or laundrettes.  They should all have had some indication of where they come from and what the photos mean.<br />Apart from the three `Boring Postcards' check out the 2000 in `The Postcard Century' by Tom Phillips, plenty of weird cards and some funny captions too.<br />Sorry Jim and Taschen but I think 'Bizarro Postcards' is a dismal failure and a step back from your usual high editorial standards.	2002-08-01

Their first book, `Classic American Streamliners', told the history of these trains in words, photos and plenty of graphic material, now this latest book takes a slightly different approach and looks at the art and design of the streamliner.  There are 175 pictures including reproductions of color brochures and lovely artwork which the railroads used to sell the trains to the public.  As it turned out it was a losing struggle as increasing car ownership and planes beat the rails.  Also included are several side-bars of designers involved in engine and train design, John Harbeson, Paul Cret, Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss and Otto Kuhler.  The last chapter Renaissance Streamliners, about the latest Amtrak trains, seems rather out of place.  American streamline was a specific design style at a particular time and modern train design is more organic in its treatment of mass and curvature. I think the rather odd looking General Motors Aerotrain was perhaps the last of the streamliners.<br /><br />Two more books about these trains are `The American Streamliner', the Pre-war and Post-war Years by Donald Heimburger and Carl Byron.  A very comprehensive study, with great photos and plenty of graphic material (all with excellent captions) but I was disappointed by the bland layout of these two books.<br /><br />All four books are the same landscape size and amazingly although they all cover the same subject there is very little duplication of photos and graphics.  If you want to see how these wonderful trains were marketed have a look at the two hundred ads in `Classic Railroad Advertising' by Tad Burness.  Also I don't think any of the books have enough photos of the great steamliners of the day (Commodore Vanderbilt, Hiawatha's, Crusader, Blue Goose, Coast Daylight, Mercury and Twentieth Century Limited) admittedly they were just steam engines with a covering shroud but they looked so good, especially the Dreyfuss designed Twentieth Century, the ultimate travelling experience, whose engine wheels were floodlit at night!<br /><br />Finally `The Art Of The Streamliner' is different from the other three books because of its bargain price.  Railfan books always seem to be rather expensive, no doubt because of limited sales, so it is refreshing to see a quality product costing so little.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.yfuss designed Twentieth Century, the ultimate travelling experience, whose engine wheels were floodlit at night!

The photos in this book are the kind you pore over, there is just so much to see.  These 125 are just some of the thousands and thousands taken by the Fairchild Aerial Survey Company from the twenties to the sixties. They are mostly large (very well printed) images of American cities and fortunately the majority are oblique shots rather than taken looking straight down.  With the oblique angle you can see the three-dimensional look of buildings and the way a city stretches into the distance.  Many of the photos show part of a cities downtown area with the building detail and traffic clearly visible.<br /><br />Author Campanella writes a short history of the Fairchild company and its founder Sherman Fairchild.  An amazing man who ran a company that designed cameras,  aircraft, navigational aids, engines, optical equipment and into the sixties he encouraged the development of the electronic age.<br /><br />The book is a good opportunity to see why American cities look the way they do.  Page ninety-five shows Tucumcari, New Mexico, in 1940, though not a big place yet the grid pattern of blocks has been established and roads built for future houses, yet the town is not at right-angles to Route 66 which passes through one side.  Pages 112 and 113 show the same shots of downtown Los Angeles taken in 1940 and 1957, the latter now has the Harbor Freeway just over a block wide running through it..<br /><br />As you would expect all the photos are very clear as they were used by local government and other concerns.  Not many were taken of cities in the Pacific Northwest  due to atmospheric conditions. Bright sunny days caused problems too, buildings created really dark shadows that obscured detail.<br /><br />This is a stunning book that planners, architects and those just curious about the look of man-made America from above will enjoy.  BTW, a tip of the hat to book designers, Paul Carlos and Ursula Barbour for doing a super job with the layouts and typography.  Though these Fairchild photos were taken for commercial reasons other photographers have taken more expressive aerial images and I can recommend these two books of photographs, taken just a few hundred feet off the ground. 'Look At The Land' by Alex MacLean, he has an eye for colorful patterns and shapes created by commercial development across America and 'This Land Is Your Land' by Marilyn Bridges, she takes advantage of the deep shadows created by sunlight in her black and whites images of town and country.	2002-07-29

This wonderful book, beautifully designed and printed, has 625 postcards of American buildings selected from six thousand in the author's collection.  He chose these for their relevance and graphic rendering.  Most of them probably originated from the Curt Teich company based in Chicago (they printed 360,000 different cards over the years).  Van Malderen writes a short informative introduction about his collection and the architectural postcard. The majority show multi-storied buildings, especially skyscrapers but there are plenty of factories, docks, bridges, churches, street scenes and more.  The buildings were photographed and then drawn (some artist drew the short straw and had to put all the windows in) to bring out the best of the structure, frequently removing nearby buildings so the original was left in all its glory.<br /><br />The cards are arranged alphabetically by city, from Atlanta to Washington DC, New York, naturally, has the most, over 150.  A nice touch is that some cards have stamps and cancellation marks on them and a few have the sender's handwriting, telling the folks back home that the building shown really is as big as it looks!<br /><br />For such a lovely book I am surprised that the publishers did not include an index.  Two other architectural postcard books worth checking out are `Wish You Were Here' by Barry Zaid, full of hotels (and their interiors) from the thirties and forties and like 'American Architecture' beautifully produced. `Not Only Building: New York' by Italo Rota, a 480 page paperback with 300 postcards. I thought it was rather badly produced, too many enlargements of the cards which unfortunately only emphasise the mass printing quality of the originals.	2002-07-27

This is one of Taschen's inexpensive, all color, pictorial reference books, full of cars lifted from fifties ads and loosely organised in date order.  It does include thirty or so complete ads. Now you will have a chance to study the photo-realist style of unknown commercial artists and see how they handled all that chrome. I think many of these paintings must have had two artists, one to do the precise detailing of the vehicle and another to handle the much more casual backgrounds and people. There are some photos included, by the late fifties paintings had given way to studio or location photography and I think a little bit of sparkle had been lost from the images.<br />As far as I can see most of these pictures have been lifted from the wonderful 925 page `All-American Ads 50s' by Jim Heimann, it has a 188 page chapter on car ads and here you get to read the copy as well.	2002-07-20

An aptly titled book of 150 movie posters (in color) most of which are of such rock bottom awfulness that you might think, just for a moment, that they originally appeared in back issues of the National Lampoon.  But these are the real thing, these are the poster styles that the Lampoon used for their inspired satires. When collected together in a book they take on a perverse fascination.  I can only assume that the designers (they were designed?) knew what they were doing and the audience they were appealing to.  Actually I think these three are quite good, The Howling, WUSA, Killer Force. <br />In six chapters, Sex, Action, Horror, Groovy, Race and Docu author and poster collector Jacques Boyreau writes a short introduction to each and his writing style is as trashy as the images.  Many of the posters are full page, all the better to study their bizarre illustrations and sloppy typography, others are two to a page and here it would have been helpful to run a thin black line round the image to stop the light colours merging into the whiteness of the page.  <br />Get the book if you are interested in this sub-genre of popular culture or if you work in the graphic design business this could be useful as a swipe file for what to avoid.	2002-07-16

This is the ninth of Robert Opie's Scrapbooks and the first using material not from his vast collection, appropriately this covers the US war years while his first book covered the British war years. An amazing 1500 items, mostly printed ephemera, from the collections of Charles Numark and Martin Jacobs are displayed in the still-life photo style that Opie created for his wonderful Scrapbooks.    The book opens out to spreads fifteen by twenty-one inches wide. Each one has a large themed still-life photo covering, Pearl Harbor, Home Front posters, ads, comics, greeting cards, magazine covers, movie posters, civil defence, V-mail, newspaper front pages, victory gardens, kids games, sweetheart jewelry, patches and medals, tobacco products, popular music sheets and more. It can get a bit overwhelming with so much material to look at but this is why I love these Scrapbooks, you can return to them again and again and still find something new.    Another book, 'United We Stand', with patriotic material from Richard Perry's wartime collection covers the same area but unfortunately it is rather badly organised and only has three hundred items but a book that will perfectly complement 'America's Wartime Scrapbook' is Stan Cohen's 'V for Victory', an exhaustive photo record of the Home Front. If you lived through the war years both these books will be instant nostalgia.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-07-16

This beautifully produced book of 170 black and white photos by David Plowden, taken between 1956 and 1992, captures everyday man-made America before it vanishes, railroads, steamboats, farmland, small towns, bridges and the subject I like best, the grittyness of the US industrial city.  Each page photo has a generous border and a caption  centred below.<br />All the  photographs are  wonderful compositions, many of them divided into threes, horizontally, some land in the foreground, then a freight train and finally the sky.  This is interesting because they show things that could not be moved, unlike studio photography, here the photographer had to move the camera to get the best shot. David Plowden seems to know instinctively when he sees something that it will make an interesting photograph.

These facsimile pages from the twelve issues of Flair are a celebration of Fleur Cowles zest for creativity in the arts. The 338 pages must have been a challenge for the Hong Kong printers, they had to cope with various foldout pages, die-cut holes, different paper stock and bind in several short pages, two concertina foldouts and five sixteen page booklets.    Sumptuous though the book is I feel that Flair is resting in its reputation. To my mind, having worked as a publication art director, the photos, typography and layouts are very conservative and do not show any particular innovative design. Other magazines and designers were much more creative in the fifties, 'Fortune' with Will Burtin, 'Glamour' with Cipe Pineless, 'Harper's Bazaar' with Alexey Brodovitch and 'Vogue' with Alexander Liberman. Certainly the covers with their die-cut holes (sadly only six of the twelve are included) and the bound in booklets were unique to consumer magazines at the time but I think that Flair should be remembered as a magazine concept rather than a magazine full of creativity.    Fleur Cowles writes a short piece about the origins of Flair (handwritten in gold on dark blue paper) but does not give enough detail (I believe each issue involved several printers and binders) and as there were only twelve issues a list of all the articles should have been included. Another reviewer has commented that the high price (reassuringly expensive?) and the cloth covered box the book comes in reflects snob appeal, I agree but I'm still pleased to have a copy.    ***SEE SOME OF THE BOUND IN INSERTS AND OTHER GOODIES by clicking 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-07-14

I think the best ones are forty-seven from the thirties when Lange was part of a small group of photographers employed by the Government to record the plight of the rural poor. Their output (now in the Library of Congress and accessible to all) was the most complete photographic record of a nation ever undertaken. Lange and Walker Evans were, depending on your point of view, the most talented of this group and you can see why by looking at her photos in this book. Keith Davis says in the introduction... \\"Her photographs are at once bluntly factual and deeply sympathetic. While Lange recorded innumerable scenes of destitution, she consistently evoked the resilience, faith and determination of her subjects\\". I think her point-of-view comes across in all the work shown in this book. After the thirties the remaining photos cover her work up to 1958.    All the photos have dated captions and many have background information about what is being shown plus the thoughts of Lange and her subjects. The back of the book has a chronology, bibliography and print source. This is a lovely record of her photographic work but if you want to know more have a look at [[ASIN:0821227912 Dorothea Lange: The Heart and Mind of a Photographer]], a really comprehensive look at her photos with excellent essays which include several reproductions of spreads from her photobooks.       ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.    BTW: This is the second book of American images I have reviewed in the last few days, the other one was a selection of photos taken over a number of years by British photographer Nick Waplington of a small town in New Mexico called Truth or Consequences (also the books title) but what a contrast, the Lange book has captions and other information, the photographer's thoughts, chronology, bibliography, sources while Waplington's book has none of this, not even page numbers!

The small town of Truth or Consequences, just down the road aways from Albuquerque on I25 in New Mexico, first attracted the attention of British photographer Nick Waplington in 1993.  This collection of one hundred and thirty-five color photos are the result of several visits to the town and surrounding area over the years. When I first got the book I had  a quick flick through the pages and I was impressed with the color quality and the subject matter.<br /><br />However, I have now looked through the photos several times and I find the whole selection disappointing, I don't think there are more than fourteen that are worth looking at again and again. The sort of photos that have a strong composition (essential) depth, good color, and subject matter that draws the viewer into the photo.  Far too many of the rest are no better than snaps, taken quickly and then onto the next exposure.  Annoyingly eighteen are devoted to some kind of parade in the town and there are at least two that any professional photographer would probably reject at first viewing when they came back from the lab.<br /><br />The back of the book has nineteen photos Nick Waplington took on a journey to Las Vegas in November 2000.  Nothing special here except for a stunning shot of a cowboy statue surrounded by buildings, street furniture and signs (ONE WAY, PARKING, ENTRANCE etc).  This one shot has the feel of the great FSA photos of the thirties and it is a pity that the majority of the rest in the book did not show the same quality as this one and really show what Truth or Consequences was like.<br /><br />The book starts with a twelve page introduction by writer John Slyce about the town and the photos and it occurred to me after reading it that the writing is as uninteresting as most of the images, for example... \\"It is through triangulated acts of some ironic quotation that `Truth or Consequences' gains critical force\\", or \\"Art today, even in its most original state, is a looped cycle of sampled and reconfigured regurgitation with little or nothing new save the prices to be established at auction\\"...  Hmmm.<br /><br />One final point concerns the books production, for some bizarre reason there are no captions (or page numbers either) to any of the photos.  Surely a mistake when many of them show events, people and places that any reader would naturally ask ... \\"What's going on here?\\".  Unfortunately we'll never know!	2002-06-30

I've always enjoyed a book about a good financial scandal, ever since I read a Penguin paperback in the mid-sixties about Tony DiAngelis and the Great Salad Oil Swindle. The 'Informant' carries on the tradition of exposing the arrogance of corporate power. However like another reviewer I had my doubts about the book after reading more than half of it because not too much seemed to be happening, meeting after meeting between Mark Whitacre and the FBI and Whitacre's meetings with the bosses of ADM take up an awful lot of pages. The book really comes alive when the Feds have the evidence and decide to prosecute ADM for price fixing in the lysine market, various departments of Government seem to have conflicts of interest in how to prosecute the case and a further twist is added when it turns out that whistle-blower Whitacre has been helping himself to company funds.    Eichenwald blends all the increasing action together and it does become a book that you can't put down until the last page. I would have preferred it if he had provided some background early on about how the market for lysine works, how come the companies that buy this product by the ton had no idea that the price was fixed? Another point (minor I admit) is that the thirty-seven pages of notes and sources at the back of the book would work best if they appeared at the bottom of the relevant pages, I got fed up with having to keeping turning to the back to check on a source. I know the purists will say that this material belongs in the back of the book but it is another example of how conservative the publishing biz is. Amazingly there are four pages in the front of the book that actually have roman numerals for page numbers.    So, an excellent read about corporate and personal greed and I'll long remember the comment from Dwayne Andreas, CEO of ADM while the price fix was in: ''The competitor is our friend, the customer is our enemy'', though he said it in the early nineties I think that it could explain a lot about corporate America in this new century. I hope Mr Eichenwald is considering a similar expose of Enron.	2002-06-09

I like the idea of everyday items being used, here you can study, for instance, Lurelle Guild's 1937 Electrolux vacuum cleaner, Norman Bel Geddes' 1940 Patriot radio, Russel Wright's 1937 American Modern dinnerware or the stunning candleholders Wilbert Orme designed in 1938, there are four shown in four separate arrangements and I would really like to have a set!<br /><br />Author Stewart Johnson explains, in an essay at the start of the book, how a small group of American designers, several of them emigres from Europe, abandoned the ornamentation of Art Deco in favor of simple clean lines, using new materials and manufacturing techniques.  Furniture designer Paul Frankl was one of this group and he became an active promoter of the new style. He tied it all down to six characteristics<br />1 Simplicity.<br />2 Plain surfaces.<br />3 Unbroken lines.<br />4 Accentuation of structural necessity.<br />5 Dramatisation of the intrinsic beauty of materials.<br />6 Elimination of meaningless and distracting motives of the past.<br />Johnson adds one other point that Frankl would not have mentioned at the time: Streamlining.  This was the idea that made the style American.<br /><br />The back of the book has several pages of designer biographies, a useful glossary (Aluminum to Vitrolite and I now know what Monel Metal is) bibliography and index.  Joe Coscia Jr, of the Metropolitan's photo studio, should be congratulated on his wonderful photography of the exhibits, they leap right off the page.<br /><br />As this  book only covers objects you might want to read about other areas of Streamline design,  have a look at `The Machine Age in America' by Richard Guy Wilson, Dianne Pilgrim and Dickran Tashjian.  I think this can be considered the standard work on the subject. Another book that I like is Martin Greif's  `Depression Modern: Thirties Style in America', it has some excellent architectural (especially interior) photos that I have not seen in other books.

Look through this little book and you will see how true that statement is.  What I like about it (and the others in this `A Crash Course' series) is the way each spread is beautifully designed with several graphic elements, a Timeline across the top, a Designer Names panel, an Every Home Should Have One panel, photos and illustrations with the headlines, captions and text, to make a visual treat.<br />The book starts at Year Dot  (the writing has a sense of fun too) and chronologically goes up to 2000 with all kinds of design references, William Morris on page 42, Barbie dolls on page 113, packaging, product design, logos, print media, electronics, transport, the text weaves them all together.  As with the best reference books it stimulates questions and the `I want to know more' attitude.<br />The back of the book has some pages on Design Classics, Design Heroes (including mine, Raymond Loewy and Dieter Rams) a Glossary and an Index. You should also check out a  book (also pocket size ) called `Design: A Concise History' by Thomas Hauffe, it was originally published in Germany and covers the same ground with plenty of illustrations but doesn't have the same kind of fun as `Design'.  A much more serious book is `Design of the 20th  Century' by Charlotte and Peter Fiell, a big, chunky 768 page paperback  with over four hundred entries of designers and design movements, plus plenty of photos.  It is the only book that I have found that names Willie Fleckhaus and his work on that amazing German magazine `Twen' in the sixties.  If you are interested in design all three books are worth having and they are all value for money.	2002-05-21

The New York Daily News was always the largest circulation tabloid in America and as Pete Hamill says in his excellent twenty page essay \\"The Daily News was possessed of a quality derived from the city itself: energy.  The tone was brash, sarcastic, irreverent.\\"  All successful tabloid papers have two things in common: the headlines and the photos and this beautifuuly produced book has hundreds of the latter.    To get great photos the paper had always invested in its photo department, which by the fifties had two planes, ten radio cars, a brigade of motorcycle couriers and a staff of sixty-three to insure no story was missed.  This book shows the benefits of this investment.  Eight chapters are devoted to a photo record of the decades from the twenties through to the nineties and as the News was a tabloid, the rough and tumble of daily toil is revealed: politicians; celebrities; sport; crime (some of these predictably stark) and when appropriate, the weather.  Each photo has very detailed captions and thankfully, the photographer's name.      Shawn O'Sullivan, who works on the paper, writes in a short essay titled 'Photography at the Daily News' \\"In making this book, we sought to show the images in all of their original beauty, as the photographer originally witnessed the scene....\\". I think this was a mistake, newspaper photographers don't know how a photo is going to be used on the page and they try to take plenty of shots, so that Photo Editors will have lots of choice.  I have a book published in 1979 celebrating fifty years of the News and it has many of the same photos as this latest book but in the earlier one the photos are handled in a much tighter way and sensibly trimmed to get the best from the image.      Apart from some of the photo trimming I enjoyed New York Exposed, a photographic book that captures the dailiness of New York life.  If you lived in the city it will be a stimulating reminder of the last eighty years.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-05-18

A book of three hundred printed items of wartime patriotism from the collection of author Richard Perry that is only worth getting if you are interested in the graphic design of this sort of material. There should have been a lot more than just three hundred items.<br />Unfortunately the book is not much more than a weakly organised scrapbook, it starts with an introduction of eighteen pages by the author, covering the military and Home Front during the war years, this is followed by three pages titled Great Britain. The remainder of the pages are filled with pictures of rather loosely organised material, such as magazine covers, V Mail, pin-ups, badges and more. Most of these items have no captions and I thought this was a major omission. There are no chapters, no index and no bibliography. <br />Covering exactly the same subject is 'America's Wartime Scrapbook', by Charles Numark and Martin Jacobs.  This is a large size, sixty-four page book with an amazing 1500 patriotic items shown.   Each themed spread has one still life photo with dozens of items, all carefully arranged so you can see the material and yet creating an interesting scrapbook feel.  With so much colorful stuff to look at it does get a bit overwhelming.<br />These three other books also cover patriotism during the war years. 'Design For Victory' by William Bird and Harry Rubenstein, an excellent paperback with 150 plus posters, covering military and domestic themes. 'Home Front America' by Robert Heide and John Gilmam, this concentrates on popular culture during the war years with good text and plenty of pictures. 'V for Victory' by Stan Cohen, a huge photo book of the Home Front with plenty of patriotic items of the type featured in 'United We Stand'<br />I do like the material in 'United We Stand' but I think the publishers should have put a bit more effort into making the book more cohesive rather than a pretty picture book of someone's collection of patriotic printed items.	2002-05-14

There are some glorious color photos in this book of Art Deco (or Moderne) houses.  Twenty-nine are featured as well as places like Miami Beach, Los Angeles apartments and Napier, New Zealand. This last place is the Deco capital of the southern hemisphere and I think there should have been more photos than just the four shown.<br /><br />Each house starts on a spread (frequently with a photo of the architect) and Adrian Tinniswood explains in detail the thinking behind the design. He also writes additional essays on other aspects of Deco style.  Unfortunately there are no plans to any of the houses, something I would have thought was fairly essential to a book of historical architecture.  I've always wanted to see a plan of the amazing Butler House in Des Moines.<br /><br />A major disappointment for me was the bland layout.  Each page has only one column which makes the photo sizes very inflexible, most pages end up with one photo and a lot of empty white space.  Someone should have suggested using more photos (especially interiors) and creating some interesting side-bars.<br /><br />The twenty-nine houses featured are probably the best examples of the Art Deco style but have a look at two other books on the same subject: [[ASIN:1901033724 The Modern House Today]] by Kenneth Powell, wonderful color photos of sixty-five still standing Moderne houses in England and [[ASIN:0486259277 Classic Modern Homes of the Thirties: 64 Designs by Neutra, Gropius, Breuer, Stone and Others (Modern House in America)]] by James and Katherine Ford, an inexpensive black and white reprint of a 1940 book featuring houses in America.  Both these books have some floor plans.	2002-05-05

A first class study of the background to the Case Study Houses project created by the southern Californian Arts & Architecture magazine.  This book was originally published in conjunction with an exhibition of the program at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 1989-1990.  It has plenty of photos and plans (though some the photos are just a little too dark) to illustrate the eight main essays.  Editor Elizabeth Smith and Amelia Jones devote forty-two pages to the actual houses with succinct descriptions, plans and photos.  The rest of this marvellous book has a huge amount of information relating to housing and the post-war environment and how the thirty-six prototype houses had a wide influence on the domestic architecture that followed.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the two essays by Thomas Hine and also Dolores Hayden's  essay:  'Model Houses for the Millions: architects' dreams, builders' boasts, residents' dilemmas'.  The back of the book has six contemporary architects ideas and plans for housing in 'Extending the Case Study Concept', followed by biographies, chronology, bibliography and index.<br /><br />Was the project worth it?  Architectural writer Esther McCoy summed it up as... `Perceived as a prototype that was to be enacted on a mass scale, the Case Study House program was a failure.  Perceived as a prophetic statement, however, as a demonstration of trends and influences that would in one way or another achieve realization, the program must be judged a success.  Perceived as art, finally, an approach suggested by their presence in The Museum of Contemporary Art, the Case Study Houses have won the right to be recognized and respected in the history of American design'.<br /><br />You might think that everything about the CSH was included in this book but Elizabeth Smith has just edited another one called (you guessed it) [[ASIN:3822864129 Case Study Houses (Jumbo)]]a beautiful, very expensive and very heavy (twelve pounds) very big (opensup to over thirty-two inches wide) 440 page visual history with hundreds of photos (especially from Julius Shulman) plans and drawings.  What was missing from this sumptuous volume was all the information in 'Blueprints for Modern Living' so if you go for both books you really will have the COMPLETE  CSH experience.	2002-05-05

A comprehensive look at book jacket design from the twenties to the nineties.  The book only covers fiction and is divided into themed spreads with between five and nine covers on each. Author Powers writes detailed captions to each cover as well as providing short essays on each decade and genre.  Nearly three hundred covers are shown in this well designed and printed book, none of them are angled or overlap other covers.<br /><br />As the title covers the last eighty years there is not much opportunity to show lots of great covers in the same style put out by some English publishers, only two examples are shown of the unique designs created by Brian Cook for Batsford in the thirties and although there are several Penguin paperbacks included you can plenty more in 'Penguin by Design' (ISBN 0713998393) by Phil Baines.  An excellent visual coverage of the company that published hundreds of titles with knockout covers.<br /><br />Most of the jackets were designed in the UK but there is a good showing of well designed US covers.  There are some pulp fiction  and thriller covers apart from the literary  stuff. A very similar book with 270 American covers is `Jackets Required' by Steven Heller and Seymour Chwast, covering jacket design from 1920 thru 1950 and if you have both these books it will make an excellent visual record of some of the best twentieth century fiction.<br /><br />Have a look at my Listmania about book jackets for more visual titles.	2002-05-04

Other reviewers have commented that the there is very little technical information, very true but I think the book is aimed at buyers who want an introduction to collecting wristwatches.  I got a copy because I'm interested in product design and as a publication designer I thought the book was nicely produced.<br />Having looked through the book I am intrigued as to why nearly all of these watches are lacking in any kind of elegance.  Even the expensive well known makes use dreadful typography for the numbers, have chunky looking minute and hour hands, thick cases and generally clutter the dials with unnecessary markings. I do think there are good looking watches though, page ninety-two shows a simple, elegant Patek Phillipe from the fifties and page sixty-six has a Vacheron Costantin. I'll continue to wear my neat Rotary GS 00898/03.<br />Amazon has over six hundred books listed under Clocks and Watches, this inexpensive little book is a good start to your time-piece library.	2002-05-03

A pleasant enough pictorial round-up of the Electro-Motive Corporation's railroad workhorse, the E Units. There is a brief history about the development of these streamline trains including nine pages with excellent engineering illustrations. The rest of this landscape shaped paperback has one per page black and white photos of the trains in everyday use, mostly from the forties and fifties. The index is usefully divided into three parts, units by number, photographer and railroads.     The photo quality is good with the occasional standout professional shot, as on page sixty-four with a new E8 demonstrator unit fresh out of the Electro-Motive plant. As is usual with these railroad fan books the design could be better, all the photos really should have a very thin black line round them, making a crisp edge which would prevent those with light sky areas merging into the white of the page. The cropping of a lot of the photos is poor, many of them have just too much sky or foreground. Trains tend to be landscape in shape but frequently pages have the captions to either side of the photo preventing the full width of the page being used, there would still be plenty of white space above or below the photo for the captions. A few black pages would improved the overall look.    I really would have loved to see these trains in color and to quote from the text...''E units helped usher in an explosion of color that had never before been seen on railroads''. Quickly checking through a few railroad books I see plenty of Es in color and I also have an out-of-print seventy-four page paperback by Henry Maywald called (predictably) 'E Units' which has over two hundred photos, all in color but mostly taken a few years later than the ones in Jeff Wilson's book    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-04-26

Photographer Bill Ganzel grew up on the Great Plains and after seeing an exhibition of Farm Security Administration photos in 1970 had the unique idea of searching out the places and people of the original photos and photographing them again.  This stunning book is the result of his quest.  All the photos have detailed captions and also the thoughts of those Ganzel interviewed.<br /><br />Of the hundred and eighty-nine photos in the book just over half are from the FSA files, the rest are the result of Ganzel's searching out the original locations over a five year period.  Amazingly he found several people who had become famous (though still anonymous) because their photos were widely reproduced in newspapers and magazines in the thirties.<br /><br />One of these was Florence Thompson who was the Migrant Mother in the world famous 1936 photo by Dorothea Lange.  I think it is the greatest photo ever taken and Roy Stryker head of the FSA photo section said it was THE image of the collection.  This is what he said in 1972 ...''After all these years, I still get that picture out and look at it.  The quietness and the stillness of it...Was that woman calm or not?  I've never known.  I cannot account for that woman.  So many times I've asked myself what is she thinking?  She has all the suffering of mankind in her but all the perseverance too.  A restraint and a strange courage.  You can see anything you want to in her.  She is immortal.  Look at that hand.  Look at the child.  Look at those fingers--those two heads of hair.''  So it was a wonderful surprise for me to see the photo Ganzel took in 1979 of Florence and her three healthy grown-up daughters on page thirty-one facing the original Migrant Mother photo of her on page thirty.<br /><br />He also found Darrel Coble who was the young boy running after his father in the well known 1936 Athur Rothstein photo 'Fleeing a dust storm', taken in Cimarron County, Oklahoma.  Another unknown yet famous person who survived theDepression and prospered.<br /><br />Other photos show railroad crossings, houses, tractors in 1936 fields with combines in 1977 fields, cowhands at dinner, churchs, gas stations, county fairs, court houses.  Everyday life and people on the Plains separated by forty years.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book capturing the feel of the thirties on the Plains and again in the Seventies.  If you collect books of documentary photos this one must be in your collection.  A gem.	2002-04-26

Well worth getting too, more pages, extra subjects (cars for instance) updated bibliography and a sparkling new layout. Author Heimann feels that architectural historian David Gebhard's term 'Programatic' does not quite capture the flavor of these buildings, I propose calling them FUNTECTURE.<br /><br />A new chapter, not in the original book, is 'Current Condition' which has twenty-two photos, in color, of buildings now standing and they all look very smart and well cared for but wait till you see the photo on page 169, this shows the amazing headquarters of the Longaberger company in Newark, Ohio, famous for making baskets and that is exactly what the building looks like, seven stories high with two carrying handles reaching up to the sky...only in America!  You can see and read about this lovely bit of whimsy on their website.<br /><br />You will really enjoy this book if you are a fan of roadside America, especially if you have lived in California and maybe remember some of the weird buildings that are no longer around.<br /><br />***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-04-18

Author Bendavid-Val sums it up as...'The moral Russian individual was called upon to yeild unselfishly to his people.  Americans on the other hand believed that the individual had a basic right to act aggressively on his own behalf, to make his own future...'.    The book starts with a super twenty-four pages of photos, each spread has a Soviet photo facing an American one, both dealing with the same subject, children, street scenes, farm workers, power stations, in a bar, shop windows etc. They do look very similar, least at first glance!    The essence of the book are two portfolios of black and white photos, first the Soviets with seventy-seven then the Americans with seventy-four, they are mostly one to a page and beautifully printed.    The author explains in an illustrated essay the thinking behind taking pictures for propaganda, this could turn out to be a bit of a hazard in the old Soviet Union where creative folk could become non-people as happened to photo-editor Lazar Mezhericher, declared a saboteur in 1937 and photographer Yakov Khalip who had the misfortune to take portraits of NKVD boss Nikolai Yezhov who vanished one fine day, also in 1937.  Khalip's work was suddenly tainted!    Incidentally 'The Commissar Vanishes' by David King is an interesting book about the falsification of photos in Stalin's Russia    What the author does not cover is why the American photos are technically so much better than the Soviet ones.  I assume this has to do with Roy Stryker's very tight shooting scripts that he made his photographers follow. Also the output of the FSA had to compete with commercial images from ad agencies and the like.  The Soviet photographers would hardly have had to worry about such competition and so their photos were much more subjective and creative. Strangely a lot of the American photos were taken in the early forties, despite the book title refering to photography in the 1930s.    Unfortunately there is no index or bibliography, which I would have expected.      Leah Bendavid-Val is to be congratulated on producing an excellent book about documentary photogrphy during the 1930s.    These photographs are some of the greatest ever taken.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-04-14

From my experience publishers that cover this market don't seem to bother with book design, strange really because it costs no more to design well as badly.<br /><br />This lovely book has hundreds of Coke Santas all presented as cutouts with a drop shadow on every picture to give the impression that they are floating on the page.<br /><br />Haddon Sundblom created the Coke Santa and every one is included, pages eighteen to forty-two show his paintings from 1932 to 1964, also including the variations he did for some years.  The rest of the book has examples of how his work (and others) was used to sell the drink each Christmas season. Chapters are devoted to store cardboard cutouts, advertising, calendars, figurines, dolls and finally miscellaneous Santa collectibles.  All the pictures have captions, with a date and a dollar value.  Amazingly some of the store free-standing cutouts from the thirties are valued up to $1500, not surprising I guess because how many managers would bother keeping a piece of cardboard promoting a fizzy drink for Christmas.<br /><br />This book is much better than a previous one I reviewed, 'Dream of Santa' by Barbara Charles, it featured the work of Sundblom and had a well printed picture for each year (except 1941, 57 and 63) but no other advertising material.<br /><br />If you collect Coke Santas or just like to look at the great man you will enjoy this book.	2002-04-07

It is a big book (at a big price) weighing twelve pounds and the landscape format opens up spreads thirty-four inches wide, beautifully printed with English, German and French text.<br /><br />Each of the thirty-six houses is covered in the same way with:<br />1  A short introduction by editor Smith<br />2  The relevant editorial copy from Arts & Architecture magazine about the house.<br />3  Photos, plans, diagrams, illustrations. Lots of the photos  are by the brilliant Jules Shulman and I doubt  you will see them this big anywhere else.<br />4  Color photos of the house today.<br /><br />Some of houses only have a spread or two (the unbuilt ones) while others have several spreads, Pierre Koenig's famous Stahl House (#22) has twenty pages.  I was intrigued by a photo on one of these, it shows the living room with a small table on which are the obligatory selection of magazines, two of these are 'America', the Russian language publication put out in the sixties by the US Information Agency, were these on display when the house was open to the pubic or did Shulman put them there just for the photo session?  I have given this glorious book only four stars because it is not as complete as it should be, the focus is rather narrow, essentially a visual history of the Study Houses and that's it!  What is missing is any historical and contemporary background and surely the reason the whole project was important was the influence it had on other architects, house builders, planners, the public and manufacturers.<br /><br />To get a perspective you will have to get Elizabeth Smith's earlier book 'Blueprints for Modern Living' published in conjunction with an exhibition in Los Angeles in 1989-1990. As the sub-title to the book says...'History and Legacy of the Case Study Houses'.  I found this a marvellous book telling me every thing I wanted to know, though there are only forty-two pagesof text and photos on the actual houses. It is a pity that a lot of the information in the remaining 214 pages was not included in this huge new volume.<br /><br />Now that I have the book, where will I put it, who makes bookcases over sixteen inches deep anyway?  Maybe I'll just leave it on a table.  I bet it will soon pop up in those house interior photos you see in glossy magazines where folk have piles of large art books neatly arranged on their big coffee tables, the cover with its black and white diagonal design will make it very visible.  Send me an email if you catch a glimpse of it in a magazine.<br /><br />IMPORTANT UPDATE Amazon have also placed this review with the ninety-six page edition.

This is a super photo book of the best streamline houses built in England in the thirties and still standing.  Photographer Nick Dawe has captured sixty-five of them and he makes them sparkle in the sunshine, some interiors shots are included as well.  Author Kenneth Powell provides short essays to the four chapters and captions to each set of house photos.<br /><br />Good as the book is I only gave it four stars because I felt it was let down by the sloppy minimalist design.  Of the sixty-five houses shown only fifteen have floor plans (beautifully redrawn by James Taylor) and strangely these are placed in three sections of the book rather than be placed on the same page as the relevant house photo.  Bizarrely the eighteen pages of plans do not have page numbers, should the reader really have to flick backwards and forwards to find the house and then the plan (if there is one!) There are nineteen spreads that have one large photo and again no page numbers. Call me old fashioned but I prefer to have numbers printed on each page, every other book has them and they work, too.<br /><br />Some of the house interior photos seem rather obscure and not helped because there are no captions to them.<br /><br />So apart from the silly annoying design I found this book worth having.  A similar book of streamline houses, this time in the US, is James and Katherine Ford's 'Classic Modern Homes of the Thirties', a reprint of a 1940 book with photos and plans of houses designed by Schindler, Ain, Neutra, Gropius, Breuer and others. It has 194 photos and 128 plans and details about each house.  Oh, and it has a number on each page too!	2002-03-25

There are thousands of them and they have all been computer generated so the style and quality is uniform. Looking at the spreads, for example, on Airport, Downtown or Wind Instruments and the time and creativity involved must have been tremendous. The design and printing of the book is excellent.    The authors want this book to be as practical as possible, Indoor Games includes a page on hands of cards, a House Furniture page shows six different spoons.    Another reviewer has noted that this lovely book would seem ideal for those learning American English and also for anyone who is just interested in finding out the name of everyday items.    A similar treatment to words can be seen in the Dorling Kindersley 'Visual Encyclopedia' (at a very much cheaper price) here the images are mostly photos and as the name implies there is a lot more information about each subject.    Both books are a joy to look at and unfortunately this only points up the bland design and production of most other highly visual books.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-03-25

I would agree with another reviewer who said the black and white format makes these photos matter-of-fact and less gruesome. With over two hundred pictures in the book, between sixty and seventy show bodies, the rest are autos in various states of demolition caused by accidents.    The flimsiness of the Detroit's product is evident in photo after photo, page 126 shows a car door, seperated from the rest of the vehicle and three-quarters wrapped round a telegraph pole. There are several car/train accident photos and the trains seem to have no damage at all, the cars are crumpled like paper.    As these photos were primarily statements of record for insurance companies and the police Kilpatrick worked out the best exposure and camera angle and stuck to it, so the book reflects his style, if it was a collection of accident photos by many photographers it would not be so interesting.  This is one man's professional work in the forties and fifties in southern California.    The landscape all-black format of the book helps the photos stand out but I have yet to work out the meaning of the small graphic item at the bottom of each page.  Tachen are to be applauded in publishing a book of photos (clearly not to everyones taste) that normally would not be seen.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-03-17

The key to survival with \\"Shopping\\" is page 27,  where the contents are, and I suggest you turn over the page corner so you can find it easily. The rest of the book is text mixed up with a kaleidoscope of color photos, charts, maps, text panels, black pages, and color photos with white copy, etc, etc. The pace never slows down! Actually, it is not as bad as that because each of the 45 chapters starts on a spread and the right-hand page is always bright yellow with black type.<br />Naturally, the text covers all the big subjects, like Victor Gruen versus Jon Jerde (these are the guys you can blame/praise for all those malls) and everything else to do with shopping past, present, and into the future. I found very intriquing a chapter called Replascape, about companies that make artificial trees and shrubs for your local mall--and to keep up the pretense, in some locations, they are watered regularly. A large part of the book focuses on the U.S., but the rest of the developed world is not ignored. Shop till you drop in Europe, Japan, South America, Asia....<br />I would have liked an index in a book this size, but I still think the publishers should be proud that they have produced such an amazing book at a very affordable price.<br />Will that be cash or charge?	2002-03-17

The chapter dealing with the Second World War has some fascinating photos of how the LT managed in this difficult period, one shows aircraft components being made in a subway tunnel.<br />If I have a criticism it is that the thirty or so bus and subway route maps are too small and bear in mind that although LT ran the buses all over London, south of the Thames there were only three subway lines for many years, rail transport was provided by Southern Railways and they are not covered. The design and production of the book is excellent.<br />The world famour Underground map is mentioned and if you want to know more about it have a look at 'Mr Beck's Underground Map' by Ken Garland, a lovely book published in 1994 with everything you'll need to know about Harry Beck's masterpiece.	2002-03-17

A fascinating collection of two hundred large, one to a page, photos capturing the fifties. The photos are divided into five sections and each picture has a caption and credit taken from the back of the print. Page sixteen shows the back of a photo from 1953 taken in Berlin and it is a mess of crossed out picture sizes, pasted on captions, five in all, and rubber stamps, this photo has been used at least six times over the years.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that most of these photos can be viewed not just as historical news images but as well crafted compositions.  So many photos that we see on a daily basis (especially in the media) are purely for the moment and lack any real creative input but the ones in this book encourage you to linger and think about what the photos are saying.<br /><br />Apart from the two hundred pictures there are three essays, Douglas Dreishpoon's on the background to the Times Picture Desk is particularly interesting, a twenty-one page time-line to the fifties, bibliography and index.  The elegant layout and excellent printing make this book a good addition to the library of anyone interested in the recent past.<br /><br />The book is published in conjunction with an exhibition of the photos that is travelling around the Nation between now and 2004<br /><br />Another book of photos from the paper is 'Pictures of the Times' by Peter Galassi and Susan Kismaric, this has 154 photos covering the last century and is equally as good as 'The Tumultuous Fifties'. Both books rightly conclude that The New York Times is the world's premier daily.	2002-03-10

Reading the review from a reader in Seattle I wonder if I have the same book.  My 'American Girlie Magazines' is about Robert Harrison and his pulp girlie titles Beauty Parade, Eyeful, Titter, Wink, Whisper and Flirt.  They were published between 1942 and 1958 and the contents mostly showed black and white photos of scantily clad ladies (Harrison did not approve of nudity) in slapstick situations...all very tame by todays standards.  The book reproduces covers and spreads from these magazines.<br />The contents of these magazines are basically trash but they do have one thing of interest, their covers, these were paintings rather than photos.  Pin-up artist Peter Driben painted hundreds of covers for the six titles and dozens are shown in this book, some other pin-up artists are included as well. <br />Before you rush out and buy the book you need to know that all the covers and the spreads have been sized sligthly bigger than the book.  This does not matter too much with the reproduced spreads but all the covers have been ruined because of this enlargement, the title logos and coverlines run of the side of the page.<br />Two better Taschen cheesecake titles are 'The Rottenberg Collection', seven hundred pages of American pin-ups (mostly nudes) from the forties to the sixties from the collection of Mark Rottenberg. European pin-ups are covered in 'Serge Jacques' by Gilles Neret. Both these titles are far superior to 'American Girlie Magazines'	2002-03-03

Called 'American Dreams' it might have been justly titled 'American Commercial Trivia'. Each year from 1889 thru 1989 has a business idea explained in a few hundred words and stock archive photos.  Of course, in some years not too much happens, the spread for 1956 covers the interstate highway program and 1935 gives a page to National Labor Relations Act and the AFL CIO.<br />A book of interesting ideas and products that have changed our lives explained in a superficial way.  I would have expected something with more substance from The Wall Street Journal...'the daily diary of the American Dream!	2002-02-24

It covers makes from 1900 to 1989 and author Donald Wood has done his research and crams in plenty of facts for the introductions to each decade. This is primarily a photo guidebook though and as another reviewer has commented, it is a pity some of the photos are not in color.<br />The three hundred black and white photos are mostly good quality. To bulk out the pages the definition of a bus is stretched, for example, on page 76 a photo of some Chrysler limos and on page 80 a Mack truck that just happens to have seats added. There is an index and bibliography.  <br />I was disappointed by the dull layout (why is it that these fan orientated titles always look so bland?) because most of the photos are to predetermined widths there are plenty of large empty spaces and it is a shame that the publishers did not care to put a bit more creative effort into the layout. <br />Still, this book will be good start to your bus library.	2002-02-24

A nicely designed book about the visual fun along the nations roads and small towns. By the nature of these signs a lot of them shown in this book have probably disappeared by now.  How many barns are still standing  with a Chew Mail Pouch Tabacco painted on them?  The author's note that as companies merge and expand one part of America can now look very much like any other part but surely this has always been the case, a Coke sign looked the same anywhere, Holiday Inn used their 'Great Sign' coast to coast.  Perhaps what they regret is the decline of originality (and fun) many small-time businesses put into attention getting signs.    Most of the hundred or so photos in the book are external signs but there are some vintage postcards, matchbook covers and architectural photos.  The chapter on motel signs shows the art of the signmaker at its best, arrows, lettering and animal shapes made out of neon, revolving stars, in fact anything to attract the eye of the passing motorist.    John Margolies earlier book 'The End of the Road' covers the same subject but concentrated more on buildings rather than signs, both books capture a vanishing America. Nostalgia fans will love these books.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2002-02-19

A wonderful pictorial book about transistor radios, 175 of them, not only photographed but put in the context of fifties and sixties design. The spread on 60-61 shows six radios mixed with close-up photos of chrome styling from fifties cars. I loved the chapter on design with its photos of grills and lettering, even a spread on 9-volt batteries.<br />This is the kind of book that Chronicle do so well, interesting subjct, well designed and printed all for the general reader.  If you collect these radios you will certainly want to have a copy but don't expect to get lots of technical detail or a price guide.  For that have a look at 'Collector's Guide to Transistor Radios' by Marty and Sue Bunis, plenty of text about seven hundred models, some photos and that all-important identification and price information.	2002-02-19

Ninety-six of the countries leading (graphic) designers see it their way.  All are thoughtful interpretations of the flag, mostly in two-dimensional form.  A couple of interesting exceptions are Chris Hill of Houston who decided to make it difficult for himself by using 2400 red, white and blue pencils, all sharpened and standing upright to form the flag.  Bart Crosby of Chicago had the bright idea of using the back pocket from some jeans to represent the stars section with a series of red waves for the stripes, oh and in the pocket he put some candy bars<br /><br />The ninety-six flags, all 7x4.75 inches, are presented one to a page in this well produced book, designed by Kit Hinrichs. I think he is one of the two top designers in the States over the last few decades (the other was Herb Lubalin) and he also collects anything with stars and stripes.  The stunning book [[ASIN:1580082408 Long May She Wave: A Graphic History of the American Flag]] has over five hundred items from his collection, some of them going back to the Civil War.<br /><br />Flag fans should also have a look at [[ASIN:0811835219 United We Stand: Flying the American Flag]] by Peter Kreitler, an intriquing book of over a hundred national magazines from July 1942 all of which have Old Glory fluttering on the their covers.  This was an idea to stress American patriotism on the first July four after Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />All three books are worth having and I think you will look at them over and over again.	2002-02-17

The authors have dug up hundreds of items from the past (mostly thirties to sixties) starting with very early Primers and going through the school grades and activities to the all-important Prom Night.  Oh and don't forget the spread of film posters featuring 'Blackboard Jungle', 'Junior Prom', 'Campus Honeymoon' etc.<br /><br />If you were in school any time from 1930 onwards this excellent book will be pure nostalgia.<br /><br />Now you can put Mary Ann's pigtail in the inkwell!	2002-02-10

Another reviewer has suggested that the brochure covers in this book are examples of good design, as a designer I can say that most of them are mediocre, though some of the illustrations are excellent. However, collect two hundred and put them in a well laid out book and they become fascinating and informative.  Who can remember that in 1950 Liberal, Kansas was the 'Pancake hub of the Universe!    Authors Margolies and Baker write an interesting short history of these brochures and their choice of material is comprehensive. A bibliography is provided and a very detailed source list.

After the attack on Pear Harbor, Paul MacNamara, a PR man for Hearst magazines, had a clever idea. On July four of 1942 why not get the Nation's major magazines and comics to show their patriotism (and sell more copies) by printing Old Glory on their covers. Nearly three hundred titles joined in and just over a hundred of them are shown in this lovely book.<br /><br />The covers are from the author's collection and it is a pity that there are not more shown. Considering that most of the covers show a flag flying in the wind it is interesting to see how the magazine's designers handled the cover layout, some titles (Modern Industry page 86) used a flat design flag and still produced an eye-catching cover.<br /><br />I would not normally mention cutting up a book but many of the covers that have a dominant flag look so nice that they would really look good mounted on a colored background and framed. They are mostly four by five inches. Maybe something to do for this years July four!	2002-02-09

All the covers are shown complete with the designer's name in most cases, none of them are angled or overlapped, thankfully! A lovely feature is the use of still life photos of the book and the jacket complete, many of them with tears and creases on the jackets, looking as if they have just been rescued from a second-hand bookstore.<br /><br />These jackets are such a contrast to the covers shown in a book I recently reviewed, 'The Great American Paperback', a colorful collection of six hundred covers (annoyingly designed so that they nearly all overlapp each other) from the forties, fifties and sixties. These covers are extremely conservative in their design approach, a predictable painting with crude typography for the title.  It was not until the mid-sixties that paperback publishers turned to eye-catching paintings and photography with intergrated typography.<br /><br />In contrast the covers in 'Jackets Required' are bursting with creativity, the chapter on non-fiction has some particularly striking designs.  The back of the book has a portfolio of six designers including my favorites, Alvin Lustig and Paul Rand.  There is a designer and title index, someting that was sadly missing from 'The Great American Paperback.<br /><br />Heller and Chwast have produced a super book that design students and fans of popular culture will enjoy for a long time.	2002-02-09

Photographer Peter Brown wanted this book to reflect the many jouneys he made across the Plains in his youth...''from open country to a small town, through this town, on to a larger one, and then out again into open space and sky'', he says in his Afterword. This great book of photos does just that.<br /><br />Years ago I read Walter Prescott Webb's definitive study 'The Great plains' and I became fascinated by this amazing part of America (still haven't managed to get there yet) and he descibes how some of the early settlers stopped when the came up against the Plains, being used to the European countryside they just could not take the flatness, no trees, no hills and if it it was not the quietness it was the wind, blowing for days on end.  These fine photos capture the flavor of what they must have seen.<br /><br />The small town photos show buildings with a weather-beaten look, the Allensville, Kansas, city hall is no bigger than a simple house, the lovely aerial shot of Marfa, Texas shows a town you could drive through in a minute and after the photo of Marathon, Texas it is back to the flat landscape until the end of the book.<br /><br />If you want to capture the feel of the Plains this book will do it for you...an excellent keepsake.

What can you say about two books that have 21700 comic book covers beautifully printed on gloss paper?  WOW! for a start. No one is going to better Ernst and Mary Gerber's five-year labor of love to complete this project.  If you collect comics from 1935 thru 1965 you need these.  I don't collect them but as a publication designer I have an interest in the visual aspects of popular culture so I got a set...despite the price!<br /><br />Open either book anywhere and start looking and it soon becomes apparent that this is a very comprehensive collection, I kept coming across comics that ran for a few issues, sometimes only one issue. Each cover has up to twenty-five pieces of information, essential for collectors. Many show a cover of the only copy known to exist.  The first sixteen pages of each book has text about collecting comics and their values.  I liked the page in book two that is  devoted to ads that appeared on the back covers, strangely some collectors only go for these, if you do, go for a copy of 'Hey Skinny!' by Mike Beller and Jerry Leibowitz, surely the only book about the subject.<br /><br />Author Gerber says on the jacket flap...''if you spend one minute examining each picture, eight hours per day, five days a week, it would require an astounding NINE weeks to complete the job.'' Nine weeks later have a rest and then go and buy the two volume 'Photo-Journal Guide to Marvel Comics' and start to look at a further 7700 covers!	2002-01-27

I always looked for Bruce McCall's brilliant work in the National Lampoon and loved the reprinted work in 'Zany Afternoons' (I bought two copies, just in case) and it confirmed that here was an unusual humorist, as good with a paint brush or typewriter.<br />This latest book though I found a bit disappointing.  The material does not really stretch to 128 pages, lots of these (especially the text ones) have far too much white space and the illustrations I found lacking in detail.  In 'Zany Afternoons' there are three hilarious parodies of Detroit car brochures, 1934, 1946 and 1958 Bulgemobiles, all have paintings  of fantasy cars with backgrounds full of detail, it is this detail that I found missing in so many of the paintings in 'Dream-O-Rama'<br />Still, the text is very funny and if you are new to Mr McCall's work try and get 'Zany Afternoons' and 'Sit!', he wrote the wonderful words to accompany the dog paintings of Thierry Poncelet.	2002-01-27

Another reviewer has noted that they are not examples of pristine artwork, well, yes very true but most of them are less than two inches deep and I don't really think it detracts from the books worth.<br />Most of the pages have nine marks and some very clean typography for the captions, there are several spreads through the book with color photos of three dimensional marks and these pages make a neat break from the majority in black and white.  If you want to see a whole load of three dimensional trademarks have a look at the lovely 'What a Character' by Warren Dotz and Jim Morton, a book with dozens of color photos of American advertising icons.<br />The chapter on anthropomorphic marks I found fascinating, here designers really had to stretch their creativity to make human forms out of company products. On page fifteen a 1962 'Mr Wirewell' from the Electrical Manufacturers Association was a face within a lightning flash with a service hat on top.<br />A fun book for designers and lovers of Americana...like me.<br />Hey...Chronicle Books, don't forget the index next time!	2002-01-26

Each one fills a page with an informative caption.  None of them would have won any design awards, mostly they follow the predictable format of illustration, headline, text and small pictures and as these are train ads, the little route map.<br />However, within this predictable (and sucessful) format you will see some great artwork, page 17 shows a 1945 American Locomotives ad with a stunning painting of a railroad yard with five streamliners, pages 52-53 has two Leslie Ragan paintings for the Budd Company. The Shell ad on page 186 looks like it was straight out of something painted by Bruce McCall (it wasn't) and there are thirteen pages of great New York Central ads that all feature cut-away illustrations.<br />As well as great art don't forget the copy. I'm pleased to see included the New Haven RR's 'The Kid In Upper 4' one of the most famous ads of the war years, read it and appreciate copywriting at its creative best. I never knew what the term 'highball' meant until I read the copy in the Pennsylvania RR ad on page 169-169. <br />I would have given this book five stars but like so many pictorial books the publishers have not taken the presentation seriously enough. Here the none of the ads have a definable edge, they just float in the white space on each page, easily solved by running a very thin black line round the ads original size or better still use a grey vignette drop shadow behind them.  The typography of the title, contents, index pages etc is very bland and unimaginative.  There are five ads that run across spreads but they don't, each has a thick white margin either side of the middle of the book, doing this is as bad as not correcting typos.<br />If you like railroad advertisments have a look at 'All-American Ads 40's' by Jim Heimann, a massive 764 page book that has (in color) thirty five of them in the chapter on travel.	2002-01-26

Golden Bosc pears thought a thirties streamline train would really push their product, Best Strike apples used a baseball player, Strength oranges an elephant and there are plenty of vistas of growing crops stretching into the horizon with snow-capped mountains as a backdrop.<br /><br />As is usual with this kind of book the designer has overlapped the images but I'm pleased to have it in my Americana library, crate art collectors and graphic designers will also enjoy it.<br /><br />Dover Books have published a book of labels (printed on one side of the page, the back is blank)that also includes a CD-ROM of the contents:[[ASIN:0486999823 Full-Color Fruit Crate Labels CD-ROM and Book (Dover Electronic Series)]] I think this is the same book as: [[ASIN:0486400069 Old-Time Fruit Crate Labels in Full Color (Dover Pictorial Archive Series)]] but with a different cover.	2002-01-23

Millions and millions and millions of tons of the black stuff are carried yearly in what is one of the busiest high-tonnage railroads in the world.  Big trains too, mostly over a mile long, some using more than eight diesels to pull incredible loads over the nearby hills.  All the ingredients for what should be a stunning photo book, regrettably it is not this one.<br />Most of the photos are black and white (twenty four in color) and in so many of them the trains occupy less than fifty percent of the photo area.  They are very repetitious, far too many taken from above with the trains in the middle distance, no dramatic trackside shots of huge diesels here, no close-ups of the wagons or for that matter no people either.  Not a single photo goes across a spread, for a big dramatic image.  The captions to the photos are all in one paragraph blocks surrounded by masses of white space. It all looks so very dull and boring.<br />There is a strong visual story to tell about the trains of the Powder River Basin but this book is so amateurish that you would be better served by watching a Trains Magazine video 'Powder River Showdown', it has a good commentary and some excellent railroad action.	2002-01-23

Companies realised that a three-dimensional figure built brand awareness.  Look through the photos and you have to admit they do look cute and so very collectable too.<br /><br />This book is the author's second attempt at the same subject, he wrote an earlier book called 'Advertising Character Collectibles', more or less the same items in each book but the earlier copy had perhaps a bit more historical detail about the companies.  I prefer 'What a Character', the photography and design are so much better and I think these count for a lot in a strongly visual book.<br /><br />Both books have a photo of the character I would love to have, the Kraft Cameraman from Kraft Television Theatre.  Yours for fifty cents and the end flap from a Velveeta carton in 1954, yours now for at least $100 without the end flap!	2002-01-19

Only about two thousand of these survive from the millions printed and 280 are shown in color.  They are not posters in the billboard size that everyone is familiar with but mostly small twenty-two by fourteen inches, quickly designed and printed by silkscreen.<br /><br />Because they were easy and cheap to produce any government or civic department could use the medium, from the New York Foreign Trade Zone, the Seattle Children's Theatre to Stop the Spread of Syphilis, the design styles are just as varied from the whimsical to the stark graphic statement.<br /><br />Author DeNoon has done his research and explains how the WPA poster division worked, other contributors provide more extra detail.  The back of the book has a Portfolio of eight artists.  The work of the WPA ended in 1943 and fifteen of their war posters are shown.  If you want to follow the story have a look at 'Dig for Victory' by William Bird and Harry Rubenstein, this informative book has 150 posters designed for the Home Front.<br /><br />Social historians and graphic artists will enjoy 'Posters of the WPA' and incidentally I would suggest that anyone interested in book design gets a copy.  The book (designed by Henry Vizcara) is an excellent example of how a graphic visual book should look, the grid design, column widths, typography of the headlines, text and captions, use of white space, paper and printing all work together to produce this lovely book.	2002-01-19

Another massive collection of colorful magazine advertisements from Taschen.  This is the same format as the first book in this series,'All-American Ads 50s', hundresd and hundreds of whole page consumer magazine ads (there are a few pages with two or four) beautifull printed.<br />As this edition covers the war years, 111 pages carry ads by American companies explaining how they are doing their bit for victory. On page 618 there is a 1941 Greyhound bus ad that features a map of the US showing all the main military camps and the copy tells how Greyhound runs a bus past most of them.  In the chapter on 'Industry' I found sixteen 1945 ads from a metal producing company called Bohn, they show futuristic designs for various forms of transport and a wonderful streamline combine harvester.<br />Most of the ads in the book use illustration rather than photography, so much easier to stretch reality.<br />This is an ideal gift book for anyone who lived through the forties and if you are just curious about middle-class life back then these thousand ads will give you plenty to think about.  A book bargain at the price.	2002-01-15

Richard Lupoff's colorful book is rather stunning at first glance but the more I look at it the more I see serious flaws.<br /><br />The presentation is too overwhelming. Several colors are used for the background of the pages and these mostly overpower the covers.  These strong colors mean that some pages have white text which becomes tiring to read, especially tiny capital letter caption type.<br /><br />The overlapping of nearly all the covers was really annoying, in some cases one cover obscures just too much of another cover.  A similar book, 'Jackets Required' by Steven Heller and Seymour Chwast has 270 covers (thankfully printed on white paper) none of which overlap and it is lovely to look at.<br /><br />As far as I can see there is no meaningful sequence to the covers, they are not shown by genre, year of publication, artist or publisher.<br /><br />The index is weak.  This is a book collectors will use and I would expect an index to the 600 covers shown, possibly even an artist index, too.  I wonder if the lack of a proper index is because at least a third of the pages have no number!  The longest run I found was seven pages (58-64) but mostly it is runs of three or four pages through the book. Should buyers really have to put up with this?<br /><br />Another reviewer has noted how disappointing this book was, I agree, not because of what Lupoff has to say but because of the poor editorial production. The author probably had nothing to do with this.  I still prefer 'Paperbacks USA' by Piet Schruders, a fascinating graphic history of the paperback, Lupoff says it 'is a landmark of paperback scholarship...'.	2002-01-15

Another Konemann bargain (how do they manage to produce such lovely books at the price?) with 832 pages, many of them with more than one photo, all the main events in the Nation's history instantly available with a picture and caption (and index). History in the broadest sense too, plenty of people and events from the everyday world. As the text is mostly captions don't expect any great historical insight though.<br />I think this would be an ideal book for children, rather than a textbook with a few photos why not start with lots of photos to inspire their curiosity about an event or personality and then let them read about it in other books.	2002-01-06

With hundreds of photos and graphic material it should have been presented in a much more imaginative way to make the pages sparkle.  The presentation is completely unprofessional which is annoying because with so much wonderful visual material this should have looked a wonderful book.<br /><br />However I did find it a fascinating visual record of the war years but exasperating at times because of the overwhelming repetition of photos.  Do I really need to look at over fifty photos of scrap drives? I just wonder, looking through the pages, if they had any photos they didn't use.  The text is basically captions and some longer essays and there really should have been an index, this is the sort of book readers dip into and refer back to.<br /><br />As well as the photos there is plenty of printed ephemera and these items intrigued me most. For example the chapter on Food for Victory has a seed packet, recipe books, posters, a cover to a home canning book, a lunch bag, a packet of waxed paper, the front of a newspaper produced by Kraft cheese, a Victory garden book.  Seeing these printed items reminded me of Numark and Jacob's stunning [[ASIN:187272714X America's Wartime Scrapbook - Pearl Harbour to V-J]] .  A large format book with 1500 printed items arranged in themed spreads, all in color, too.<br /><br />Both books, visually, approach the war years in a different style.  I love Numark and Jacob's scrapbook format and if only Cohen's book hadn't been so amateurish editorially it could well have become a standard photo book on the period.	2002-01-05

The material is arranged in ten chapters and each has dozens of relevant magazine ads.  What I particularly liked about this massive volume was the way all this colorful material has been handled, not a singe ad has been angled or overlapped on another. Here the pace is generated by running one ad over a spread, enlarging a section over a spread (basically for creative purposes) having one ad per page or in a minority of cases running four ads on a page.  I think the designers took the view that reading the ad copy was as important as looking at all the amazing pictures.  I also liked the range of material, besides the obvious consumer product advertising there are plenty of trade ads from the commercial sector.  Stunning though this material is I do have a couple of minor objections, a few of the ads do have text that has run off the page and I would have prefered to see a thin black line define the edge of the ads where they are four to the page.  This is the first volume of a series that will cover All-American ads of past decades and if they are all is good as this book it will be an incredible collection.<br /><br />UPDATE My review originally appeared with the 928 page edition of this wonderful book and Amazon have also placed it with a mini paperback edition but you can still get original from some Marketplace Sellers.

It didn't take the world long, in the thirties, to accept that the man in the Christmas Coke ads was Santa and this delightful book displays Haddon Sundblom's paintings over thirty-three years.  If you see a tall, thin man dressed in red and carrying a sack of toys the chances are that it was painted before 1933.  Sundblom wisely thought a fat jovial looking guy had more credability than a thin one.<br /><br />Wonderful though this book is I wish the authors had gone the extra mile and made it a comprehensive study of his Santa paintings, his work for the years 1941, 1957 and 1963 are missing.  The text refers to alternative paintings created in some years to fit the various media used (billboards, magazines ads and retail unit cutout figures etc) some of these paintings are shown but not all.  Most of the paintings are shown without advertising copy, I would like to see how the copy or headlines were used, a small reproduction would have been useful. They could have reproduced the back cover of the The National Geographic which Coke used every December for a Sundblom Santa ad.<br /><br />A lovely book but I am disappointed that the full potential of the subject was not realised.  Perhaps a better book is [[ASIN:1887432930 Coca-Cola Collectible Santas: Official Coca-Cola Collectors Series]] because it covers Coke Santas in all sorts of marketing forms.  Nicely designed, too considering it's for the collectors market.	2002-01-03

So as well as some striking images you get the feelings and observations of 2000 people.  How many books could be opened at any page and the contents immediately grab your interest?

With the Jolly Green Giant and Popeye included in the cover pictures I think you will realise where this book stands.  Charles Dickens is not mentioned in the Author Index.    As a reference book to over 2000 pop culture fictional folk it is quite comprehensive.  Each entry has a short description and the title where the character appeared, problem here is that only the title is given, not the medium, television, film, book, radio etc.  There is a good title and author index and a photo or quote appear on most pages and it is rather well designed, too.    This is a good addition to your reference collection, which will of course include the essential Benet's 'Reader's Encyclopedia', Popeye in this is the character in William Faulkner's 'Sanctuary'.	2001-12-30

If you really have the collecting bug check out 'The Collecting Book' by Ellen and Lewis Liman, 800 photos of collections and lots of practical information.<br />I wonder if anyone collects books about colectors?

Album Art from the Space Age is the subtitle of this book and it is a flimsy premise to fill 118 pages.  The text says nothing that has not been said better before, especially in the  definitive book on the subject Joseph Lanza's 'Elevator Music'.<br />Look at the LP covers in the book and it soon becomes apparent that the quality of photography and design of most of them is just mediocre.  Capitol Records was the only company to consistently produce good covers, they even did good typographic liner notes.<br />The books production does not help either, the covers are uniformly dull in appearance (this was a real turn off for me) with many of them too small even though there is plenty of white space available. Captions repeat the LP title, artist and record company all of which are visible on the covers anyway, the only useful reference is the year they were released.  A book of similar LP art is Benjamin Darling's 'Vixens of Vinyl', here the covers are printed on gloss paper and look so much more attractive, also I think Darling's book has a better selection of covers.<br />Though wider in scope than 'Exotiquarium' I prefer 'In the Groove' by Eric Kohler, this covers LP cover art from the 40s thru the 60s with over 250 covers and is a real treat to look at.	2001-12-30

This is an expensive book but you need only buy it once and you will have readable plans and details of more than 470 Wright buildings. I love his work and have several books about the great man but I find that plans in other books are sometimes unreadable because of the reduction to fit on the page.  William Storrer has redrawn them all and taken nearly all the black and white photos.  These are to Wright's specification: exterior shots to be in a natural context and include foliage, interiors should be taken with natural light and from a seated position and as Storrer says, this last condition excludes most contemporary color photography of his work. Also included is a ZIP code index of the buildings if you want to visit and see the outside, lucky Illinois and Wisconsin have the most.    Brillliant though this book is I really wanted to see Wright's work in color and I can recommend 'The Vision of Frank Lloyd Wright' by Thomas A Heinz, an inexpensive 448 page book with a color photo of every building.    Both authors are experts on Wright and if you have these two books (and a table to support their weight) you will hardly need to buy any other books on America's greatest architect, then again I liked Doreen Ehrlich's 'Frank Lloyd Wright Glass' and Carla Lind's 'The Wright Style: the interiors of Frank Lloyd Wright' and......!    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2001-12-02

This large, well designed and printed book has over two hundred color images of his commercial work. Each company has their logo and a brief history to accompany the paintings.<br /><br />Norman was not responsible for how his work was used in the ads so his efforts were somtimes ruined by messy design, just have a look at the 1936 Cream of Kentucky bourbon ad on page forty-seven. Generally though the advertisers wisely let his paintings do the job they paid him for.<br /><br />The most surprising work to me were his paintings of children used on Kellogg's Corn Flakes boxes in the mid-fifties, they even carried his signature.  I wonder how much a good condition box is worth now?<br /><br />This is most likely the only book of his commercial work available so it worth adding to your Rockwell library.	2001-11-18

This is a book about about a product that we all take for granted but the history of Formica and its uses is quite fascinating.  Author Lewin was the Creative Director of Formica from 1982 so don't expect to read anything untoward about the company, the twelve other contributors tell the story from their perspective, I particularly liked Jeffrey Meikle's essay on 'Plastics' and Susan Bayliss on 'Formica in Women's Lives'.<br />So this book will tell you all you need to know about the history of the product, in text and photos, plenty of them and this is where the book comes to a full stop.<br />The design is just infuriating!  Only the right-hand pages have numbers, captions are all given a chapter and photo number, this is repeated near or on the relevant photo, now for the crazy bit, every photo has a bit cut out of it, it could be a triangular shape or a curve or maybe a bit of one photo on the same spread cut out and placed on another photo.  This is just visual nonsense and I am surprised that a quality publisher like Rizzoli allowed this appalling design to go all the way through the editorial process and not get picked up.<br />A pity because it is an interesting book ruined by the work of some trendy designer who should go back to design school.	2001-11-17

There some historical photos from the fifties and sixties, including a super one (page 27) from 1956 taken at Durand, Michegan, the essential station photo, a parked car or two, people waiting trackside, smoke drifting up from the engines smokestack, station building, signals etc.<br />The photos of freight and passenger trains are taken through the seasons by thirty nine photographers, captions are explanatory without too much technical detail, the books landscape shape  helps display the trains better than an upright format.<br />After looking through the book a few times I was aware that I could tell if it was a Greg McDonnell photo, to my eye he seems to have a knack of framing the train in the composion and all the elements in the photo work together.  This is not to say the other photographers are not as good as McDonnell (the famous Emery Gulash has a great dock and diesel photo on page 130) but his work clicks best with me.<br />Railroad fans are very demanding customers, they want raw energy, speed, sharpness, detail and very little moody, out-of-focus stuff that other photographers might say contributes to their best work, I suppose railroad photographers are basically involved in the reportage style.  This and McDonnell's other book 'Signatures in Steel' of railroading in his native Canada are as good as it gets for train fans. Highly recommended.	2001-11-13

Hundreds of color photos and illustrations, 140,000 words of text, 380 maps, 80 graphs, a 4,000 item index and its big size (18.5 by 12.25 inches) makes this history in awesome detail.    Each spread has a theme with a short introduction and the rest of the space devoted to maps, photos and well-wriiten captions,  some of the spreads also have a time-line section across the bottom.    I found it interesting that the authors wanted this to be accessible history, part of the spread on the auto industry has eleven photos showing the development of tail fins from 1948 to 1964.  The spread on printing and advertising includes six pictures showing the changing face of Betty Crocker.  Want to know more? Turn to the bibliography in the back and each spread is numbered and relevant books listed.    A clever idea is the inclusion of a piece of acetate with the US printed in four sizes, lay this over the maps in the book in the same four sizes and it avoids having to print each State's name and boundary on every map and getting it confused with what the map is explaining. BTW: if you are buying this book used make sure the acetate is included.    I used to design publications and I can appreciate the incredible amount of thought and creativity that went into this amazing book.    The National Geographic donated 35,000 copies to schools across America and I cannot think of a better way to follow the Nation's story than this book.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2001-11-07
US	43058502	RTVP0UY8718E9	076430108X	602584194	Genuine Plastic Radios: Of the Mid-Century (A Schiffer Book for Collectors)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Turn on and tune in to this book	If you collect mid-century plastic radios you should own this book.  Sixty-six manufacturers are represented with 450 color photos, the popular companies, such as Crosley, GE, Motorola, RCA and Zenith each have several models shown.<br />Besides a photo of the radio there are plenty of close-ups of tuning knobs, speaker grills, frequency ranges and each maker has a close-up of their logo.  Also included are some period ads from the fifties.<br />Page 176 shows the front of a Trav-ler 5022 from 1950 and on the facing page is a shot of the back of the set. What a contrast, while the front is the best the marketing/design folk could come up with the back shows a clutter of wires, batteries and evidence of cheap mass production.<br />Looking at the design of the various models it becomes clear that as these radios all do the same thing it became important  to sell the product on other (non-existant) virtues.  The names (Wide-fi, Transitone) reflect high technology, big tuning knobs reflect scientific precision, some makers logos are heraldic reflecting snob values, the plastic cases were in bright eye-catching colors.<br />I think it would have helped if the dimensions of the sets had been included and the photography is very bland with the radios set against insipid backgrounds.  Radios can look good, have a look at Philip Collins 'Radios:The Golden Age' and 'Radios Redux', dozens of beautiful shots mostly against a black background which make the radios jump out from the page.<br />This is a book though that any serious collector and those interested in fifties popoular culture and product design should have.	2001-11-04

The text (basically captions to the photos) provides a superficial but exuberant look at Vegas.  The first half of the book covers the origins of the major hotels and casinos, plenty of color photos, match book covers, postcards, menus etc presented in breezy layouts. The section on the entertainers I found dull as these people, looking at the photos, could have been performing anywhere.  For what ia really a fun book it does have an index.<br />A far better coverage of Las Vegas can be found in 'Viva Las Vegas: after-hours architecture' by Alan Hess.  This book is almost the oppposite of 'Fabulous Las Vegas', essentially text and some color photos but Hess has done a tremendous amount of research.  The really keen could plough through 'Learning From Las Vegas' by the architectual team Venturi, Scott-Brown and Izenour, their controversial view was that Vegas, because of its popularity, should influence building design elsewhere...I think I would agrre with that.	2001-10-30

I'm a big fan of Greyhound having travelled around the State in the sixties and I love their buses, especially the Scenicruiser (drat, only six photos!) so this book is a good addition to my very small Greyhound library. There are over a hundred large photos starting with the first Greyhound in 1914 and every other Greyhound bus up to 2000. The captions are full of interesting detail and they provide the only text.<br /> A thing that troubles me about the book is the very bland presentation, so typical of this kind of fan orientated publishing.  Some of the photos could have bled of the page, others could have gone across the gutter, some of the pages could have been black with white captions, anything to give the pages a lift and make the publication sparkle.  Still a bland book of Greyhound photos is better than no book at all.	2001-10-28

There are over 3500 covers (in color) from the start of the last century and they are all one and a half inches by two inches, actually they could have been a bit bigger by reducing the generous margins round each cover.<br /><br />Despite the small size there is plenty to enjoy in this well printed book. All the Rockwell's and Leyendecker's are here and into the forties and fifties you can follow Albert Staele's cover paintings of his spaniel Butch, or the regular winter snow scene covers painted by John Clymer.  My favourite is Stevan Dohanos, he seemed to delight in cramming in as much detail as possible offering reader's a reassurance of the familiar and everday.  Some publisher should do a book of his Post covers.<br /><br />I was interested to see the covers of the short lived new look Post from September 61 to June 62, these were created by the famous designer Herb Lubalin but his efforts did not impress Middle America and the cover and inside look returned to the regular style.  I always thought they looked great and I would love to have these 37 issues in my Post collection (send me an email if you have them)<br /><br />From late 1962 the Post covers were almost all photographic, just like any other mass market magazine and the last weekly issue came out on February 8 1969. This book is a visual record of a unique American publication, just have your magnifying glass handy to enjoy the experience.	2001-10-20

Beautifully printed and designed and with more than 3500 photos to explore the work, year by year, of these two famous designers. The range of work is amazing, furniture (domestic and commercial) films, exhibitions, architecture, books even toys. I have a set of their 1952 House of Cards, a deck of fifty-four playing-card size cards that can be interlocked to create three dimensional structures, a very simple idea beautifully conceived.<br /><br />If I have a criticism it is that the book does not have an index and that makes refering to it rather frustrating.<br /><br />I think the book easily reflects the joy and stimulation that Charles and Ray Eames got out of the creative process.<br /><br />2005 REVIEW NOTE Many of the pages in the book are devoted to the short films Charles and Ray created, you can get thirty-five of these on a wonderful six DVD box set 'The Films of Charles & Ray Eames' (ASIN B0009S2K92) they are available individually but cost a lot more than the box set.	2001-10-20

Robinson Studio Glass Collection	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A celebration of a brittle subject	This is a beautifully printed book for those who want to see the best in contemporary studio glass. The seventy eight works shown were donated to the Detroit Institute of Arts by Aviva and Jack Robinson. Bonita Fike contributes a short essay on studio glass from the sixties.<br />Considering how fragile glass it is amazing how these artists create such wonderful shapes and textures. I love the vase by Stephen Powell (page 61) and the Karl Schantz's colorful 'Urban Rainbow' (page68) made from vitrolite glass.<br />The back of the book includes a comprehensive artists biography and book list.	2001-10-15

His introduction details how a small group of brilliant designers refined Art Deco into a unique American design style. Greif uses most of the 260 excellent photos to show commercial and residential architecture, a discipline that was easily able to show the spirit of the style. Strangely there are no examples of the stunning Greyhound bus terminals designed by W Arrasmith, hundreds of thses terminals spread the message of Moderne to every city and town across the nation.<br /><br />Other photos cover transportation and products, though Grief feels a lot of Moderne design in these areas is not much more than clever marketing, adding three or four speed lines to the casing of a product and calling it STREAMLINED. The famous steam trains of the period just covered the basic engine with a sleek shroud.<br /><br />I think Greif is right to concentrate on buildings, if you want to see products have a look at these two lovely books: [[ASIN:0810942089 American Modern, 1925-1940: Design for a New Age]] and [[ASIN:2080304992 American Streamlined Design: The World of Tomorrow]].  Both are full of streamline products beautifully photographed and with the Greif book you'll have a remarkable overview of this fascinating style.	2001-09-25

The three hundred pre-1940 postcards should have made the buildings of Big Apple come alive, instead so many of the cards are shown too large and this emphasizes the flaws in the original printing of these mass produced postcards. However you could use this book as a taster for the much more interesting 'American Architecture: a vintage postcard collection' by Luc Van Malderen. This has over six hundred postcards with 188 devoted to New York city, all beautifully printed with detailed captions about each building.<br />Both books show images of a city that must have been awe-inspiring to the people who bought these postcards and mailed them to the folks back home.	2001-09-08

The format is deceptively simple, each spread has a big photo devoted to one theme: food packets, teenage magazines, Barbie dolls, film posters, candy wrappers etc. You can see dozens of packets your ma kept in the kitchen cupboards or maybe that car brochure dad had back then, possibly you had one of the twnty toothpaste tubes (page 19) in your bathroom. The 1400 items pictured in this book are mostly what the rest of us would have thrown away, Opie wisely (for us) saved it all for his packaging and print museum in Gloucester, England. This is an excellent resource book for those interested in graphic design of the period	2001-08-24

Ray Gun Classics	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Zap back to childhood	I love books about the backwaters of American popular culture so I was pleased to get a copy of Leslie Singer's affectionate look at ray guns of the past.  The hundred color photos in this nicely presented book will provoke plenty of nostalgia for those who grew up with Buck Rogers.  Mr Singer's favorite is the Atomic Disintergrator (page 18) but my favorite is the space car (page 48) streamline curves straight out of the New York World's Fair in 1939, though it was made by Wannatoys in the fifties.  Not a gun but it looks so good Singer included it anyway!<br /><br />If you are really into the subject have a look at: [[ASIN:1584180048 Ray Gun]] by Eugene Metcalf and Frank Maresca, plenty of excellent color photos, including a quite stunning gun (page 101) from sixties England, the Space Outlaw Gun.  There is also a selection of film posters and boxes the guns came in.  Both books have a useful bibliography and 'Ray Gun' even lists web sites.	2001-08-12

All these photos tell a story because the photographers had very tight shooting scripts organised by their boss Roy Stryker, his railroad script had up to 80 items to be covered.  Unfortunately the production of this book does not do justice to the wonderful images. The photos are printed in 150 screen with the black areas of the photos looking dark grey so reducing the depth of field. The majority of the photos look flat and dull, the typography and design is bland and uninviting.  A pity because such wonderful photos deserve better    The author does mention two railroad books in the bibliography, though not Depression years related, that I think are worth searching out.  [[ASIN:0821207598 Decade of the Trains: The 1940s]] by Don Ball and Rogers Whitaker is a first-class overview of the period.  Steamers, streamline diesels, passenger and freight, worskshops, stations and plenty of action shots.  The other is [[ASIN:0831071125 The iron horse at war: The United States Government's photodocumentary project on American railroading during the Second World War]] a remarkable book of 272 photos by Jack Delano taken in 1943 and to show how the industry coped with huge increase in freight and passengers in the war years.      ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.	2001-08-10

What sort of rooms did middle-class America live in during the fifties? Just have a look at the 250 room-set photos in this fascinating book. The advertising folk at Armstrong Tiles had the neat idea of showing the companies product as part of a room set to inspire home owners. These photos were used in their ads in the leading consumer magazines of the period.  The photos are sharp, well-lit with no deep shadows, everything had to be visible and they capture the time between mom just cleaning the house and the folks arriving!  I find the many kitchen and bathroom shots the most interesting, living in London during the fifties my parents would have loved to have such units and facilities.  This book and the companion volume on the sixties, are a wonderful reminder of how we lived in the recent past.  Although it does not detract from the photos the typography and presentation are rather bland.	2001-08-05

Far too much white space was left on many pages where stunning rarely-seen photos and graphics should have been bigger. The authors clearly know their subject and it is a pity that they or their publisher did not feel it was necessary to spend some time on a better presentation. Page 173 mentions a forthcoming Postwar volume, I hope this edition will have a better design treatment.	2001-07-18
