We read them because we like the Star Wars universe and enjoy reading books set there. This novel is the counterpart to a videogame, setting the bar even lower. How surprising to discover that this is actually an extremely well-crafted bit of miliatry/sci-fi writing. I enjoyed this book immensely, and would have been satisfied by far less in terms of complexity, character development, and writing style. Although the plot revolves around a commando team on a dangerous mission with a Jedi Padawan, the book is really about the culture of the Clones and gives the reader a fascinating look into the culture of the clone troopers as a whole. Darman, the lead Clone commando, is by far the most interesting character in the book, outshining the Jedi Padawan by a long shot.  The Clones come off as heroic yet tragic figures, born and bred for war but with the capacity to understand peace and enjoy levity. Accelerated in growth to be ready to fight but of normal emotional devlopment when confronted by emotionally challenging situations. <br /> <br />More of the Star Wars books should be on this level. It raises the bar for the whole series.	2005-03-29

While expecting to see admissions officers focusing on students accomplishments and achievements, an overwhelming amount of attention was paid to &quot;diversity&quot; and how the school's profile would look in the next US News and World Report College Ranking Issue. Those who believe that college admissions (at least at Wesleyan) have to do with merit will be quickly disabused of such notions as candidates with weak transcripts and poor SAT's are admitted over qualified applicants, often based on their status as a sought-after minority. <br />The book also focuses on several applicants applying to Wesleyan in addition to other schools and tracks their progress, successes, and failures at various universities. I was reassured in the end as those applicants who were qualified tended to do well wherever they ended up going, while those who were poorly qualified performed...poorly. In a way, Wesleyan is doing poorly qualified students a disservice by admitting them to a highly competeitive school that they might not be prepared for. One poorly qualified candidate, who the admissions officer at the focus of the book practically bends over backwards to accept, predictably runs into serious academic trouble very quickly and ends up leaving Wesleyan due to terrible grades, and does not go on to finish college elsewhere. I thought this story was emblematic of the pitfalls of preference-based decision making in this type situation. What ever happened to admissions based on merit?	2003-08-15

Let's just get something out of the way before I write the rest of this review: These three prequel novels do not hold a candle to the works of Frank Herbert, and I consider all of the prequel novels to be strictly non-canonical with respect to the Duniverse.<br />Now, that having been said, I really enjoyed this book. Brian Herbert and Kevin Andersen have done a nice job of weaving a complex storyline over the three prequel novels, and manage to tie all of the loose ends up in this book. The story is quite intricate and weaves no less than 8 separate plots together to tell the narrative, with some storylines getting more space than others. The book is very fast-paced (thanks mostly to the very brief chapter lengths) and I enjoyed the fact that the authors tried to incorporate some minor charactors from the real Dune books into the plot and to flesh them out as was feasible within the confines of the story. The use of such charactors as Piter, Thufir, and Count Fenring is very well done and helps to anchor the book (and the reader) in the settings and time we have come to know and love. Some major charactors, most notably Shaddam and Leto, are portrayed fairly one-dimensionally, which was a disappointment as they are really the focus of the book. <br />The book bogs down in the middle after a nice start, but really winds up well with a very exciting last 100 or so pages.<br />I also appreciated the maps of Kaitain and Geidi Prime.<br />Overall, worth reading for anyone who enjoyed the Dune series.	2001-11-03

As an avid fan of the Godwin/NASA Mission Reports Series, I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I had eagerly looked forward to an in-depth, detail-laden, fact-packed look at RSC Energia, but was dismayed to find that the book only contains approximately 20 pages of text (including the introduction by Godwin). The remaining pages are filled with photos, that are only occasionally placed in chronological order. In addition, what little text there is is very uncritical and reads like a propaganda page, neglecting any mention of the political history of RSC Energia, the impact of the loss of the &quot;moon race&quot; on the organization, the checkered political career or Sergei P. Korolev (who was once interned in a prison in Siberia for political crimes), or the profound social impact the space program had on the average russian citizen. Even more frustrating, despite what Godwin says in the introduction, a great many of the photographs in this book have been previously published in the west, albeit mostly online. <br />Overall, the book is worth purchasing for those who wish to obtain some high-quality images of Soviet/Russian space hardware, but does little to enhance the understanding of the Soviet/Russian space program.  The excellent biography of Korolev by James Harford did a nice job of detailing Korolev's life, but left out many details about the entire space program that this book could have filled in.	2001-11-02

While many of the astronaut autobiographies have been marred by shameless self-promotion (&quot;Off the Planet&quot; by Jerry Linnenger, or &quot;The Last Man On the Moon&quot; by Gene Cernan to name two), Astronaut Collins gives real warmth to his coming of age in the Gemini and Apollo programs. He is surprisingly honest about his own anxieties and fears, as well as candid about his role as &quot;the one who didn't get to walk on the moon&quot; on Apollo 11. Offered command of a later lunar landing, Collins demured, both out of respect for his family and out of a fear of pushing his luck. Collins often comes off as cranky and irritable, but never lets you forget that he started as an &quot;outsider&quot; amd had to climb his way to the top of the Astronaut hierarchy. <br />I was especially impressed with his candid assessments of the other astronauts. <br />Overall, a great read. Not as dramatic as some other books of this type, but probably more honest.	2001-06-18

This bio of Sagan by Davidson attempts to unravel both the MAN and the SCIENTIST within Carl Sagan, and for the most part succeeds. <br />The book is extremely well researched, and you can feel how much time Davidson spent running around the country interviewing a great number of Sagan's friends, colleagues, and family members. Written in a style that made reading 100 pages at a stretch very pleasant, the main focus of the narrative is Sagan's lifelong struggle between the search for scientific rationality and reason and his sometimes very irrational beliefs in some non-mainstream aspects of science and the search for extraterrestrial life. <br />Make no mistake, Sagan is portrayed as a very real and human person in this book: this is not just a glowing publicity piece. His flaws and unpleasant side get equal time, especially with regards to the treatment of his first two wives and some of his associates. Some have criticized the author for not being more positive about his subject (one review on this site suggests the author even HATED Sagan, a point with which I would strongly disagree). I feel that the portrayal of Sagan is very balanced. He was married three times, held a variety of teaching posts (some of which did not go well for him), and did not get along with everyone he knew:of course he had a darker side. <br />Overall, a very capable job by Davidson. Worth reading for anyone interested in planetary science, or anyone who was inspired by Sagan's works (written or otherwise)	2001-05-07

I have read other works by Baxter and universally enjoyed them, but was somewhat taken aback by Silverhair. I expected a sort-of mammoth's-eye-view of the ice age, but this is hardly the case. The book follows a small family of mammoths as they have a series of adventures, many of which I found extremely difficult to swallow. At times the mammoths seem about as smart as cattle and at other times are capable of seemingly high-level thought. Honestly, it would have been okay either way, but for them to have more or less intelligence as the plot requires at a given time is silly. <br />The book is incredibly violent, which was also unexpected. There are several long sequences that are very upsetting to read as the animals suffer tremendously, and their suffering is detailed greatly. <br />Overall, it is tough to give this one a strong reccommendation. The book has a great premise and, to the best of my knowledge, has never been attempted before. Still, the authors inconsistency in portraying the mammoths combined with the often needless violence made this a sometimes unpleasant read. The book is supposedly the first in a trilogy, but I would be surprised if I read the others.	2001-03-30

Although on the surface this is a book about the recent robotic missions to Mars, the book is really an exploration of the culture of the project scientists at NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Bergreen paints very full portraits of many key people involved in NASA, JPL, etc including the scientists, graduate students, industry representatives, etc. The book reminded me very much of Jim Watson's excellent account of his work to elucidate the structure of DNA, &quot;The Race for the Double Helix&quot; in that it showed the human side of science. Jim Garvin, Jim Head, Sean Solomon, and the other scientists in this book seek good and solid data, but also (understandably) seek publications in prestigious journals to advance their careers. They worry openly about funding and grant support. Jim Garvin has what sounds like a strained relationship with his wife, who does not really seem to understand her husband's passion and dedication. Some of the investigators don't like each other, and show this openly. These sorts of interludes were very interesting as many books about science and scientists are sterile and portray scientists as absent-minded-professor types who are not grounded in the real world (which is only very rarely the case). <br />The book is very readable and well written. My only complaint is that the book would have benefited from some illustrations. The images from the Mars Orbiter were discussed ad nauseum, but no representative images were between the covers of the book! Also, I would have liked to have seen a few photos of some of the hardware and researchers discussed.	2001-03-07

It is an homage to the Apollo program as much as it is about a manned Mars mission. Baxter very accurately conveys the frustration that so many people feel about how the US space program just seemed to dry up and go away for almost the entire 1970's, and how all of the momentum that the Apollo program generated was just squandered. Page after page after page I wished that reality had been closer to Baxter's vision, but instead we just got a few skylab missions and then years of nothing. This coupled with the fact that any real manned Mars mission is years away was very frustrating! <br />The book is cleverly structured so that the events leading up to the mission very closely parallel events from the real apollo program. An early disaster with loss of life, the crew selection, the lead-in missions, the selection of the contractors to build the hardware, etc, were all disguised versions of very real events from the 1960's. It was as if Baxter were nodding and winking to fans of the Apollo program.<br />When one visits either Kennedy Space Center or Johnson Space Center one can see actual, flight-ready Saturn V launch vehicles that were never sent into space(the Saturn V in Huntsville, Alabama is not a flight article but a test article). Looking at those earthbound spacecraft produces similar feelings to reading this book: both make a person feel that the potential of the space program was not lived up to in those decades. Now those Saturn V's are rusting museum pieces, as are hopes for a manned Mars mission anytime soon.	2001-02-08

I was very interested in the technical details behind the loss of STS-51L aka the Challenger Disaster. After a brief period of discussion of the specifics of the accident, Vaughn delves incredibly deeply into the culture of NASA and the management culture that in some ways directly led to the loss of the vehicle and her crew. <br />The amount of info Vaughn is able to bring up is incredible, and she must have done hundreds, if not thousands, of interviews to compile all of her data. I was amazed at how freely some people were with their comments (given the subject matter) and here reconstruction of events in fantastic in it's detail.<br />This is not a book to be read lightly. It is an in-depth social analysis more than it is a book about the Challenger Disaster. Of note, it was shelved under sociology (and not Science/Technical) at my local bookstore. Many people who live in cultures where high-risk decisions are made(doctors, law enforcement personell, etc) would benefit from this work.	2001-01-29

This book is an incredibly detailed exploration of history of the development of the Space Transportation System (aka space shuttle). The book begins with a history of some pioneering work by Germans in WWII and follows the history of the development of the concept of the shuttle, how contracts were awarded to aerospace firms, and how the actual shuttle was built. The book also details the first 75 shuttle missions. <br />The text is vigorously illustrated with copious black and white photos as well as many, many line drawings of various proposed shuttle variants, design concepts, etc.<br />Books like these are a boon to those who have read all of the standard &quot;so-you're-interested-in-the-space-program&quot; books as they delve deeply into technical issues and provide a lot of hard data as opposed to broad strokes. This book works very well with such texts as the &quot;NASA mission reports series&quot; edited by R. Godwin. <br />My one and only complaint is that there are many typographical errors and omitted punctuation marks that are distracting. <br />A must for those really interested in the details.	2001-01-24

While niether of the two Dune prequels can hold a candle to even the weakest of the original books, Dune: House Harkonnen felt like true trip back to the Duniverse. Gone were the cookie-cutter characterisations and pat dialogue of the first book. In this book, there is a harder, harsher feel that comes through in almost all of the chapters and is more reminiscent of the original series. The Baron and Rabban are truly vile and reprehensible as opposed to moustache-twirling clods (as they were in House Atreides). Jessica is fairly accurately portrayed as are Duncan (whom, we are told, loathes gholas in an interesting bit of foreshadowing), Piter, Thufir, and Gurney Halleck. Leto and Rhombur are still somewhat oversimplified for unclear reasons. Sadly missing (again) are all of the internal monologues that really made the Dune books stand out.<br />For the most part dovetailing with facts and events presented in Dune, the only oversight is the meeting of Gurney and Liet Kynes (which actually did not take place until many years later). <br />Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson seem to have taken some of the criticism of Dune: House Atreides to heart, and for this I commend them. They have left themselves room for one or possibly two more prequels, and I hope they do write them and continue to refine their efforts at the same time. <br />Overall, very well done for what it is: A book set in the Duniverse but not written by Frank Herbert.	2000-11-03

I thought this book would have been Gordo's reflections on being one of the Mercury Seven astronauts, similar to what John Glenn,Al Shepard, Deke Slayton, etc had written. In fact, only the first half of the book is about his Mercury days. The second half is a journey with Gordo into the world of the paranormal, as Cooper spends quite a lot of time with psychics, UFO fanatics, people who believe that they are being contacted by extraterrestrials, etc. Cooper is astonishingly accepting and uncritical of their stories. He says things like, &quot;At first I was skeptical, but soon I started to believe that aliens were talking to her!&quot; He never keys us into his thought process to show us how he was convinced and never lets us try to decide if these people were for real or just plain nuts (I assume the latter was the case). <br />At one point Cooper even thinks that, based on what one of these people has told him, that an alien ship is coming to take him on a trip. Honest! He goes so far as to pack a bag!<br />Overall, I would say to read the first half and forget about the rest. Both this book and Gene Cernan's &quot;The Last Man on the Moon&quot; serve to remind us that some of these astronauts, despite their good qualities, were very odd people.	2000-09-21

Hmmm... this is a difficult one to review. <br />This book is basically an  advertisement for the author's &quot;Mars Direct&quot; scheme for manned  mars missions.<br />On the one hand I laud Zubrin for all the time and effort  he has placed into thinking up his &quot;Mars Direct&quot; plan for manned  mars missions. The idea is certainly appealing and contians much that had  never been presented before. Most interesting is his idea to live off of  the land to minimize the need for bringing unneeded supplies and fuel.  <br />On the other hand, it is apparent on first inspection that there are no  shortage of technical shortcomings for the Mars Direct plan despite it's  advantages. Much (if not all) of the hardware that would be required for  Zubrin's plan does not exist today or exits in a format that is so far from  practical application that for all intents and purposes it cannot yet be  applied to this idea. Zubrin seems to assume that everything will work  smoothly and that one mission will just flow smoothly into another. Both  the US and Soviet space programs have clearly shown that hardware mishaps  occur, usually with disastrous results. Zubrin's dependence on unmanned  vehicles to go on ahead in advance and land safely as well as on target  time after time is very unrealistic. If these unmanned vehicles  malfunctioned or crashed everything is on hold for months or years until  the problem can be fixed. The text does not even mention possible problems  with the Mars Direct approach, a serious editorial oversight. <br />I don't  mean to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Zubrin means well, and if  more of us gave this problem the amount of effort he has, we would have  been on mars 20 years ago. Read this book for it's novel ideas, but don't  buy into them hook, line, and sinker.	2000-08-28

Dickinson does an excellent job of covering all the bases for the amatuer astronomer. The most worthwhile aspect of the entire book are the 20  annotated and detailed maps of the sky as seen from the northern  hemisphere. They are absolutely indespensable when viewing the sky and  allow one to find otherwise easily missed stellar sights. I have two  complaints about this book, one minor and the other major. The minor  complaint is that his moon map would benefit from more detail, as I quickly  exhausted the list of named and detailed features it held and imagine many  have as well. <br />My major complaint and only real reservation I have about  this book is that the author is very biased in favor of large and expensive  telescopes and makes the argument that only such instruments can provide  quality views of the stars. The truth is that such instruments are beyond  the financial reach of 95% of amatuers. I own a 4 and 1/2 inch newtonian  reflector and separately purchased a handful of quality plossl eyepieces  and have made detailed observations of most of the planets as well as many  nebulae and other objects. I spent a total of about $300-400. Had I  listened to the advice of the author and not bought a scope in this range I  would have missed out on years of quality viewing. It would have been more  helpful if he had mentioned which of the low-cost scopes were worth buying  (as some are) instead of dismissing all models below $500.	2000-08-28

I liked the feeling of being along for the ride and the discussions  of the technology needed to get to and live on Mars. The novel had a  &quot;You are there&quot; immediacy that was very rewarding. The  charactors, with the exception of the narrator,are fairly flat. Bova is no  Frank Herbert in this respect. People seem to have one facet or intrest and  that is all. What attempts at &quot;hidden agendas&quot; or insight Bova  wrote into these people was so simple or silly it was a waste of space.  Still, worth reading for the feel of a trip to mars. Of note, Bova never  informs the reader what year the book takes place in.	2000-08-28

In some ways this was better than the first as there  was more of a sense of this being a complete novel as the ending here is  much more satisfying. A lot of gimmicks take up a lot of time (such as the  hunt for a possible saboteur) but overall it was a fun read. The charactors  are more fleshed out and develop visibly over the course of the book and  Bova makes an effort to make them less shallow, succeeding in several  instances. The book almost has a soap-opera feel to it as most of the  explorers have sex fairly frequently with several partners along the way.  This is used predominately as a tension-creating device and it works well  in the context of a small group of people far from home. Not a waste of  your time but only read it if you enjoyed the first volume in the series.	2000-08-28

This book is a welcome feast of data on the ability of otherwise  intelligent and thinking people to believe strange or bizairre ideas  without any proof behind them while ignoring hard evidence of the  impossibility of those same ideas. <br />Shermer does a nice job of covering a  variety of topics including UFO's, creationism, holocaust deniers, and  psychics in a way that shows just how fervently people hold onto these  beliefs and presents arguments against each of them in a thought-provoking  fashion.

Overall, this book was a good addition to any space enthusiast's library. It had a lot of detail about the actual flight of Apollo 8 and he astronauts that flew the mission that I had not seen elsewhere. <br />The  major problem with the book is it's completely inappropriate and unending  fascination with the religious lives of the astronauts. The space program  was a secular venture, paid for by the citizens of the United States,  including Christians, Jews, Moslems, Native Americans, etc. The astronauts  had no business reading from a religious text during the broadcast from the  flight, but as history has shown they did it anyway. Still, Zimmerman  speaks (glowingly, endlessly) about this portion of the flight as if it  were the most important moment of the entire mission. In addition, he goes  on ceaselessly about the churches in Houston that the astronauts attended.  These sorts of asides added nothing and indeed detracted from the thrust  and pacing of the book. <br />While some have critisized his cold war stories  as also being out of place, I enjoyed them as they involved the astronauts  themselves.<br />Worth reading, but buy it in paperback.	2000-03-08

While I'm sure that many readers found Ms. Shirley's tales of overcoming chauvanism uplifiting and fascinating, I personally found them irritating and grating. Much of the early part of the book (detailing her childhood  and young adulthood) deals with the author coming into conflict, again and  again, with overt male chauvanism. Each and every time the author overcomes  such hardships through her hard work and gumption. While I have no  objection to such tales in general, I felt that in this case they took a  lot of momentum out of the book and revealed a lot of lingering anger  (towards men in general) on the part of the author. Also, the author has  little insight into these episodes and altercations, and recounts them in  such a one sided way (i.e.-&quot;I was honest and true and they were evil  and prejudiced...&quot;) that I was hard pressed to believe that she was  recalling them accurately.<br />Nonetheless, the book does finally move on to  the story of the Mars Pathfinder Mission, which was what I was really  interested in hearing about. Ms. Shirley gives a good description of life  at JPL and also does a nice job in discussing the technical hurdles to be  overcome in such a far-reaching endeavour. I especially enjoyed the  chapters about the development of the rover, as they did not gloss over a  lot of interesting technical details (as other books dealing with  Pathfinder have). <br />Overall this was a good book that could have been a  great book. Ms. Shirley has really given us two books:An autobiography and  a book about the Mars Pathfinder. I would have preferred the latter without  the former.	2000-02-21

As others have noted, the cover is misleading. This book is a detailed chronicle of the manufacture of the Lunar Module, and not a general history of the Apollo program. In fact,  given the number of general apollo histories available, I think it would  have sold better had it been more aptly titled. Although a tad  melodramatic, the authors weave a cohesive narrative and truly convey the  enormous complexity of designing and building the LM. It was nice to read a  book that was not just about the astronauts but instead about those who  actually put them into space. I would reccommend this book for serious  space enthusiasts and not the casual reader. The best chapter is the last  one, dealing with the end of the LM program and the fate of the lunar  modules, both those that went to the moon and those that stayed on the  earth.	2000-02-11

If you're looking for a serial-killer story with a completely unbelieveable storyline, the world's most inept detectives, and a &quot;killer&quot; who (with no medical background) is  able to perform complex medical proceedures, then &quot;Toyer&quot; is for  you. By the end of the book I didn't care if Toyer was caught or not. This  book is so jam-packed with unpleasant characters (all of whom sleep with  each other at some point) that I was hoping they would all get bumped off  by the end. Thank God I only bought it in paperback. This book was so  unrealistic that it was laughable, and certainly not frightening. Read Red  Dragon instead, which has similar themes and was ten times the book.	2000-02-07

I thought that it was a lot of fun and full of heartfelt emotion. Shame on those who criticize the authors writing style as being too simplistic-it's his first book for crying out loud! His  sentences were to the point and made for quick reading. <br />Worth the read  to anyone who enjoyed to film or has an interest in the plains indians.	1999-11-28

I mean, one could argue that John Glenn has done some of the most exciting things that a person who lived in the past 100 years could do: He fought in two wars as a fighter  pilot during the golden age of aviation and at the dawn of the jet age, he  was the first american to orbit the earth, and he flew in space at the age  of 77, in addition to being a multi-term senator from Ohio! But despite all  of this his book was so dull I could not believe it! Somehow even his  descriptions of combat were dull! I honestly did not know what to make of  it all. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for him to get to the meat  of the book and to inflect the writing with some verve... but it just never  happened.  As a die-hard space and aviation enthusiast, i would only  reccommend this book to those interested in hearing some hithero  undocumented anecdotes abot the Mercury program.	1999-11-28
