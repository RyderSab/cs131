This highly-anticipated book by Daniel Lawrence is a great read for any HP fan. Enhanced with new Book 6 insights, analysis and a comprehensive index, browsing through the pages of this book is about as close as you can get to actually being at Hogwarts!  <br /> <br />FINALLY, a book that takes the entire Harry Potter series (Books 1 to 6 and Movies 1 to 4) and puts it into a light even us HP fans have to take a step back from and say, \\"WOW, I didn't know that!\\" I've been an avid HP fan for years and surf the sites on a daily basis, yet I still found myself taken aback by the information/material in this book. First you can you quiz yourself on what you THINK you know. I found some things I thought were fact were just actually well accepted rumors in HP Web Circles, but this book cuts through those and gives you an in-depth answer to each question without adding any unnecessary writing that goes nowhere. It just gets right to the point, which is exactly what every HP fan wants.  <br /> <br />Secondly, this book is not just a question-answer book. The answers are not just given as simple one line statements such as \\"a.) HERMIONE or b.). DUMBLEDORE.\\" This book gives you the answer and then provides superb explanations as to why it is that answer. The facts that come with the answers are great at giving you a behind-the-scenes look at the writings of JK Rowling while using the trivia to guide you through her subtle clues. I can find myself taking more time reading the answers then the question just so I can read the facts that this book touches on. If you want to test yourself on Harry Potter Trivia and graduate to the level of expert, buy this book.  <br /> <br />This book is the ultimate companion piece toall the books in the series, especially Book 6. SPOILER WARNING: Don't even consider opening the Ultimate Trivia Book unless you've read all six books of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. The author's unique ability to discover little-known insights, clues and facts are strictly for trained wizards only. <br /> <br />Whether you are an avid HP fan or just a casual reader, child or adult, this book is a \\"must-have\\" challenge for any true HP fan. Highly recommended. <br />	2005-07-01

Almost biblical, the lyrical dialogues and descriptions draw you into the reality that is South Africa and don't let you go. Stephen Kumalo becomes a hero and a friend to empathize with and admire. As a college student, I have read this book 5 times and written papers on it for English, History, and Sociology classes. (I got A's on all of them!) I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys great literature and a great story. The 1995 movie with James Earl Jones was superbly done and was the first of the three versions made to be filmed in South Africa. The last scene with Kumalo on the mountaintop was so beautiful and moving it made me cry	2005-05-02

I read this book for the first time many years ago because I am a John Steinbeck fan. I thought that Grapes of Wrath was wonderful, but this book is even more mesmorizing. You can picture the characters and actually feel the good and evil and confusion in each of them. I read both Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden at least five times. Both are lengthy, but both tell a story that will keep you up all night reading. If anyone has seen the old movie, it no way compares to the book. What did compare to the book was a television mini-series way back in the 80's which starred Jane Seymour as Kathy. It was wonderful and so portrayed this book.	2005-05-02

Basically not much happens and a lot of the story describes the land and how Levin is so wonderful and devoted to his wife. Some whould say that this is superb literary thechnique, I say that if you are publishing a novel, let it have a story line. Anna's hardly even in the story anyway. Most would argue that Levin (the goodie two shoes) is the protagonist because he represents Tolstoy's view of Russia.	2005-04-18
