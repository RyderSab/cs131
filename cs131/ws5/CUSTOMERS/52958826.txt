I was pleasantly surprised to see that the author used his access to the other people involved to get everyone's story.  Almost everyone involved was heavily quoted, even when it reflected negatively on the author.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of is that the book is written for Trekkies- that is people with a solid knowledge of the series and characters.  Episodes are referred to by title, and the reader is expected to recall the details.  The writing itself is good and enjoyable.	2005-10-03

This may be so, but I think this book conveys what Hermann Buhl wanted to say- after all he approved it.<br /><br />While text such as \\"[my recollections of Nanga Parbat] are ... shining, alluring visions which sear one's heart and wipe out all memory of distress, worry, and disappointment\\" does not sound like his words, I think they well describe the sensation.  And that is one of the key differences between this book and Messner's book, \\"Hermann Buhl- Climbing Without Compromise\\".  This book conveys, as a detached writer would, the thoughts and feelings more than the exact words or technical details of Buhl's life.  For those who prefer, or want additionally, to \\"hear\\" Buhl's own voice, and many more\technical details of his accomplishments, I recommend Messner's book.<br /><br />FYI, the 1987 Movie \\"The Climb\\" only covers Buhl's climb of Nanga Parbat, but keeps fairly close to what is described here, and even \\"quotes\\" Buhl from this book.	2005-09-25

This is the story of the intellectual development of a young man- Jack Frake.  While it could have happened anytime, this story occurs about thirty years before the American Revolution.  While it is not even suggested in this book, by the ideas and actions young Jack takes, one can tell that he will, somehow, in a later book, be a part of the revolution.<br /><br />In addition to this, we see Jack, and his heroes, take deliberate actions to further their values.  I can't express how pleasurable, and uncommon, it is to read of heroes who act with principles, integrity, and honesty.  The writing also keeps to the high standards by supplying enough details to allow one to imagine oneself in the action, but not so much as to bore the reader.  All in all, this is the best novel I've read in quite some time.	2005-09-05

Firstly, the photos are absolutely stunning.  I've seen books with only photos, not as good as those included here, that retail for more than this book.  The second way this book engages readers is through the well-told story of one of the most interesting characters in mountaineering history.  Finally, and perhaps best of all, by using extensive source material from Hermann Buhl directly, this book actually comes across as a personal introduction to the legend, Hermann Buhl, himself.	2005-08-23

The author here does that throughout this book.  Here's one example- \\"the halter of specificity has been imposed on heretofore disorderly concepts.\\"<br /><br />My other strong objection to this book is how the author takes an active voice asserting his own (incorrect, in my opinion) philosophy.  He does this in numerous ways in numerous places throughout the book.  For example, he indicates Aristotle's philosophy as something that Newton needed to overcome, instead of recognizing Aristotle's role as the originator of the scientific method.  As another example, the author states that Newton's religion, Arianism is \\"heresy.\\"  He says this despite the fact he admits that Newton kept his religious views to himself.  How did the author determine Newton's religion?  For that matter how did the author determine anything?  The book has no bibliography, much less footnotes.<br /><br />Finally even Newton's scientific work is undercut by the author's poor views on this subject.  For example, the author sees an arbitrariness in the fact that Newton's laws \\"favor\\" a straight line.  The author asks \\"why a straight line?\\" and claims Newton had no answer.	2005-08-17

It is clearly shown that his policies had dramatic negative results on the economy, prolonging the depression for many, many years longer than would otherwise have been the case.  It is also shown that many of these policies continued for decades (with many still in place) causing problems for many future generations.<br /><br />Further, by showing how FDR's actions contradicted themselves the author shows how FDR had no principles, nor any understanding of what he was doing.  As but one example, FDR would attack some industries for supposedly keeping prices high and preventing competition, he enacted legislation that did just that for the big agricultural firms.<br /><br />One thing notably absent was how he managed to get reelected three times.  While he was obviously charismatic, and did a great job of doling out political patronage it seems hard to believe that the opposition could not show how he was keeping people out of work while not even being consistent to any one set of principles.  Obviously FDR managed PR exceptionally- to the point that he continues to be thought of very highly by many people.<br /><br />Another mystery the book does not really cover is how FDR bent the Supreme court to his will.  In his first term, they properly overturned most of his work.  After which, he tried to pack the court by forcing out almost all current justices.  He was met with universal opposition and that failed.  But \\"somehow\\" after that the book states \\"Justices Hughes and Roberts ... gave up defending constitutional liberties\\".  It sounds to me that more may be involved.<br /><br />One interesting statistic I looked up after reading this book was that Hoover and FDR averaged 249 and 289 executive orders per year when that number averaged 76 before them and 69 after them.  I think this point speaks loudly as to how power hungry both Hoover and FDR were and am surprised it was not mentioned in this book.<br /><br />Overall, FDR's Folly is an excellent book that should be required reading in high school history classes.and am surprised it was not mentioned in this book. <br /> <br />Overall, FDR's Folly is an excellent book that should be required reading in high school history classes. <br />	2005-08-14

Unfortunately it does not go clearly in any direction.  Because it takes the perspective of looking at the economic viability of space, one could assume it takes a capitalist viewpoint.  This would be incorrect.  While the author does mention the possibilities of private companies taking part, the dominant perspective is one of a government in control saying what is and what is not \\"appropriate.\\"  For example, the government would determine that mining space for materials instead of energy is not the best use of space resources.<br /><br />While the book appears to have some good science in it, because it unquestionably accepts global warming and other myths, it lacks solid credibility.  People with strong scientific background should be able to follow and understand the material, but others may have issues with the damaged credibility.<br /><br />In short, I'd recommend this book for someone with the scientific background to be discerning about the science presented.  Conversely, I would also recommend it to non-scientific types who want to see an interesting, informed perspective on how space may be developed.	2005-07-28

Feynman (Helix Books)	Books	3	2	16	N	N	A mixed collection	Many of this collection of stories are very enjoyable, giving a personal view into the person behind the scientist.  Unfortunately, some of them are rather disturbing, standing in stark contrast to other information we have about him (even from other stories in this very book).  Among the worse pieces is the one titled \\"The Value of Science.\\"  In it Feynman says things like \\"I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy\\" and \\"scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty ... none absolutely certain\\".  The commitment to REALITY of a scientist is one thing (among several) that makes a scientist better equipped to deal with nonscientific problems.  And if scientists are not certain of anything, how can they be certain that they are uncertain?  It is an oxymoron.  Also, where is the pleasure in finding things out if nothing is really found out?  Granted a scientist's commitment to reality means he is always open to new evidence, but this does not preclude certainty.  Statements are made in a context, and they can be certain IN THAT CONTEXT.  If there appears to be a discrepancy, the scientist will attempt to discover how the context has changed.<br /><br />The other big disappointment is Feynman's apparent lack of knowledge or concern for Philosophy.  While most philosophies support the kind of pseudo-science of which Feynman complains, there were some philosophers (notably Aristotle and Ayn Rand) who used reason exclusively and are therefore a major cornerstone of Science.	2005-06-17

In particular, three aspects of transmission are explored- word of mouth, stickiness, and context.  The research disclosed about these aspects is solid and useful.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author makes some major philosophical mistakes towards the end of the book.  At one point, he implies that because people take context into account in their decisions they are somehow less consistent and less virtuous for doing so.  At another point, he assumes that people are like paper clips in front of a magnet, able to be manipulated any which way by marketing or other influences.  The truth is that given more information, people may make different choices.<br /><br />I'd recommend reading the first five chapters (about 75% of the book) to get the best parts of the book, with a minimum of the bad.	2005-05-11

I'm not sure whether or not the book was titled to play off the saying \\"the road to Hell is paved with good intentions\\" or not, but that is in effect Hayek's main criticism of Socialism.  He shows in numerous ways how socialism must lead to totalitarianism, and indicates a few negative aspects of totalitarianism, but fails to reject socialism on the grounds that is morally wrong.  In fact he argues against the possibility of a \\"benevolent dictatorship\\" on the basis that the process favors the malevolent!<br /><br />Do you notice a problem here?  While all his points are valid, Hayek concedes the moral high ground to the socialists.  His main argument amounts to \\"the goals of socialism are noble, but there are no practical ways to get there\\".  Well the goals, means, and ends of socialism are the destruction of individual rights.  Speaking of individual rights, Hayek's grasp on that is weak at best.  Hayek claims that individual rights are preserved so long as the rule of law is preserved, and that is preserved so long as all laws apply to everyone without exception.  I hope most people can think of numerous laws that could be applied equally to all and still be a violation of human rights.<br /><br />If you seek an understanding of what's wrong with socialism, I would highly recommend Ayn Rand's \\"Capitalism- The Unknown Ideal.\\"  If you seek an understanding of how socialist philosophy led to the rise of Nazism and Communism, I would highly recommend Leonard Peikoff's \\"Ominous Parallels.\\"	2005-05-01

While they prove this point with dozens of interesting examples, the question of why they do this received little attention.  Also unanswered was the question of how academia got so unbalanced.<br /><br />The book also shows that some academics are no longer able to deny acts of treason by numerous communists, so they are now justifying them as being true to their \\"principles\\".  They portray capitalism and socialism as moral equivalents from which to choose.  While the authors point out that USSR prohibited opposition parties and the US allowed them, they could have gone much further to illustrate that this is a basic choice of good and evil and that those who chose to aid the USSR were evil, as are those who defend it today.<br /><br />Aside from these issues, the book was an enjoyable and informative peek behind the iron curtain that still appears to exist in academia.	2005-03-16

This book takes on a noble goal- to try to bridge the gap between information technology practitioner and manager.  It properly identifies that most I.T. managers are tossed into management positions as a result of doing well in subordinate positions with little or no guidance as to the requirements of their new positions.<br /><br />While the book starts off with solid advice, advising would-be managers to first consider whether they want the new position and detailing many of differences.  Unfortunately, as the book details the responsibilities of an I.T. manager, it misses some very big ones including training the team, innovating to improve existing processes, and generating synergy within the team.<br /><br />As the book continues, it gets worse as it espouses bad advice including dropping out of recurring meetings attended as non-manager (in many cases the manager will attend the same meetings but in a different role) and ensuring employees do not carbon copy the manager on emails where the manager does not need to take an action (the manager should be copied on many of subordinates' emails to observe the interaction between the manager's employees and others.  In the worst advice, it goes on to say how outsourcing is usually a good thing and that good managers support it.  In all my experience and that of those I've talked with, I have not heard of a case where outsourcing has not led to both higher costs and poorer service.<br /><br />In summary, if one reads the first five-six chapters and keeps in mind that it only covers some aspects of a technology manager's job, this book can be helpful.  But if one reads beyond the sixth chapter, any good is outweighed by the poor advice that follows.	2005-03-06

However, when you are a manager, the people who work for you can either ensure your success or make it virtually impossible.  This book gives you a lot to think about in terms of how to systematically identify, recruit, and retain the best performers- those people who will make you look best.  While I don't agree with all the specifics, the areas discussed are vital to consider.  The book is also well written.<br />The only real downside to this book is that it assumed the employees' market of 1999-2000 would last forever.  While that's not true, and companies may accidentally, in employer's markets, be able to get good employees, the best employees will flee to companies that treat them right when the market turns.	2004-04-25

This book has a great intro explaining what Microsoft is trying to do for developers with the .NET framework as well as how and where they suggest it should be used.<br />After the first three chapters, I recommend treating this as a reference book and not trying to read straight through the rest.  For example there are chapters on migrating to dot net in general, migrating from VB 6 to VB.net, web services, and .NET remoting to name a few.<br />As far as a reference book, it focuses on explaining the bigger picture of how to handle common chores.

One main flaw in this book is that it pretty much ignores the design aspect of setting up a new database and/or server.  For example, the book lacks any information on best practices for the physical layout (files, drives, RAID, etc) or security.  It assumes someone (a consultant?) knew what they were doing and set up the server and databases.  Personally, I see this as part of the administrator's role.  Another major shortfall of this book is that it excludes clustering completely, and as databases are more and more critical to companies, clustering is gaining in popularity.<br />This book is designed as a reference book and it does a decent job as that.  The layout, contents, and index make finding what you need very easy.  If, however, you want a book to read cover-to-cover in order to learn SQL administration, this is not it.	2004-04-09

For any established process, it's likely that enough has changed since the process was born that the process is no longer the best way to get from the beginning to the result.  This book is well written and easy to read and the examples are especially useful in illustrating the major benefits of reengineering.<br />Unfortunately, many of points are not as well-thought out.  For example, the book advocates building teams around discrete processes but fails to realize that this just moves companies from horizontal silos to vertical silos.  These vertical silos cause different but still serious problems.  Also, the book mentions the critical role of Information Technology, but fails to realize that they can often lead reengineering efforts because if they have a solid knowledge of the business and new technologies they are in the best position to see the new possibilities.  Another confusing area is that book indicates certain problems that should be overcome in an initial reengineering project such as functional departments and lack of understanding of reengineering continue to be problems for subsequent reengineerings.<br />Many of the questions that are not answered in this book are answered in John Case's &quot;Open-Book Management&quot;.  Open-Book Management and Reengineering have many things in common including empowered workers, performance measured by results, and coaching managers, but Open-Book management does a much better job of explaining what really drives these changes and how they can best be aligned.	2004-04-06

While this book makes some good observations, it makes critical mistakes in oversimplifying a lot of its &quot;evidence&quot;.  Yet it fails to find any ideas that simplify its &quot;eight basic principles&quot;.<br />As an example of a mistaken oversimplification, the book claims that &quot;rationality&quot; always yields negative, i.e. pessimistic, business forecasts, but this fails to understand that projections are guided by assumptions, that in turn are guided by management.  Companies that penalize those whose forecasts are too optimistic will encourage its planners to use negative assumptions.  Companies that don't, won't.<br />Many of the &quot;excellent companies&quot; have seen very bad times or were driven out of business completely in the years following the book's release.  I think that shows that the authors were missing quite a bit in understanding the real nature of excellence.  Fortunately, in subsequent years authors such as John Case (Open-Book Management) and Jack Stack (The Great Game of Business) have hit upon a much simpler yet more complete model for excellence.  Not only does their model explain what is correct about The Search for Excellence, but it also explains the correct elements in many management ideas since including &quot;reengineering&quot;, &quot;TQM&quot;, &quot;Empowerment&quot;, and &quot;Six Sigma&quot;.

There have been many, many books on software project management lately, but this one still is one of the best.  Perhaps the context of older simpler technology helps illustrate the principles more clearly.  While some new technologies have an impact on projects, particularly the encapsulation aspect of object-oriented design that allows for real code-reuse, the fundamentals don't change.  Further, Brooks shows us why there can never be a &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; that will revolutionize the art.<br />He covers in great detail critical elements such as team structure, development process, conceptual integrity, and scheduling issues (including the myth of the man-month, for which the book is named).  Further, since he draws on experience from classic projects such as IBM's OS/360, the book has interesting history as well.<br />My only issue is that with recent increases in power of PCs and languages, many &quot;projects&quot; are now of such scope that they need only involve a single developer, in which case a different paradigm is needed.	2004-03-29

While it focuses on the technical side of the job, it does mention the need for skills on the business side of the job as well.  Further, the technical side of the job is what DEFINES the job of the CIO- otherwise IS could just report to the COO or CFO.<br />This book discusses managing platforms, information, and applications; leading programs, initiatives, and projects; and using measurements for process monitoring and improvement.  It also covers the human factor- managing staffs and politics- but that is the weakest section of this book.  While many topics are covered in fair detail, Bob Lewis' down-to-earth style makes this a very enjoyable read.<br />Even if you are not looking to be a CIO, this will help you understand how CIOs operate, and let you better judge whether or not they are doing a good job.	2004-03-29

There is an element of truth in his theory- times of identifying, testing, and accepting new theories are times of upheaval and quite confusing for many.  Unfortunately, Kuhn fails to recognize that there exists an objective reality that does not bend or shift to agree to whatever mankind's consensus opinion is at the time.  The world was not flat when many supposed it was.  The sun did not revolve around the earth when many supposed it did.<br />Fundamentally, Kuhn fails to accept the difference between the scientifically proven and the scientifically likely.  Nothing that was scientifically proven has ever been disproved.  Often what happens is the context in which a theory is known true is found to be limited.  For example, Newtonian laws of motion are as true to today as they were in Newton's times.  The difference is that today, we know that at speeds or levels of precision unknown in Newton's times, relativity adds an effect to alter the equation.  Newton's laws of motion were never proven in that context.  Only an assumption that they applied there was disproved.<br />Ultimately, Kuhn adds more confusion than clarity with this work, as is the case with any attack on reason.  For a much better analysis of truth and epistemology, I'd highly recommend Ayn Rand's &quot;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology&quot;.	2004-03-27

Many more will you what to think.  In this book, Ayn Rand discusses how to think (epistemology is the study of knowledge/thinking).  This is an absolutely imperative question, because unlike the lungs or the heart, the mind does not function automatically.  Fortunately, this book does a great job of explaining every aspect of thought from concept formation to the role of language to the need for abstractions.  The book also describes three basic axioms (existence, identity, and consciousness) and shows how any attempt to disprove an axiom must in fact rely on that axiom, and thus is self-defeating.<br />My biggest question after reading this, was how was this not included in my (and everyone's) schooling?  It's one thing for schools not to present Ayn Rand's epistemology, but no school (before college) I am aware of presents ANY epistemology.  That more than any other statement shows the poor state of modern academia.	2004-03-27

The author candidly admits that personal experience in leading a company is the only real way to learn, because each company has its own unique challenges, and because situations look quite different in the heat of a tense moment, rather than in the comfort of a book.  Nonetheless, this book does give the reader plenty of areas to think more about, and tells a great story in the process.	2004-03-26

While the title and beginning of this audio book suggest a focus on verbal combat/conflicts, the content is important and applicable in a much wider scope of situations.  It is very impressive the range of topics covered in this relatively brief presentation.  While the audio format allows greater clarity when explaining tone of voice and voice stress issues, for those that are more visual, I strongly suggest taking notes.  This audio book offers great ideas toward helping you communicate whatever it is you want to say.  Some of the topics covered include matching your sensory style to your audience, preventing reflex arguments, making your voice more pleasing (without spending considerable time or money), giving feedback (positive and negative) in a way it will be best received, and, of course, disarming verbal attacks (without pissing off your attacker).	2004-03-26

I was hoping to see application of the ideas of 1-to-1 to employees instead of customers.  A lot of similar benefits could be reaped.  There is also virtually nothing about managing in a 1-to-1 company, or instituting that kind of change as a manager.<br />What this book has is a number of marginally interesting mini-case histories &quot;caselets&quot; that convey only the basics of what was done, and nothing about the thought process used to develop the ideas or the issues that came up and were addressed in the implementation.  A book with a quarter of the cases, but with substantially more detail would have been much more useful.	2004-03-26

Once one has read that book and is either interested enough to want to learn more or sold to the point he or she wants to implement it, then this book is the perfect follow-up.<br />This book focuses on the details, and they say the devil is always in the details.  You could say the authors first book dealt more with the &quot;WHY&quot; and this deals more with the &quot;HOW&quot;, though there is some crossover.  By drawing experiences (both good and bad) from 100 companies, the reader can benefit enormously by not having to deal with as much trial-and-error personally.  I highly recommend this book to those who are likely to implement OBM.	2004-03-22

These basically translate into those who want to control what people *do* such as dictators, and those who want to control what people *believe* such as religious leaders.  The essay goes into detail explaining their dependency on both each other and their victims.  Perhaps most importantly it explains how not to be a victim.<br />The second half of the book illustrates many of the principles described in the first half through excerpts from Ayn Rand's fictional works We The Living, Anthem, The Fountainhead, and Atlas Shrugged.

To name just a few of the many glaring contradictions in this book:<br />1.  The book claims that many jobs are being lost and that there are ample temporary opportunities but if you do the math replacing 2 permanent jobs with 1 contract job does not leave enough contracts for everyone.<br />2.  The book claims companies save money by using contract employees and then also claims that portable executives can make more by contacting than they could as employees.<br />3.  For most executives, relationships with the staffs they lead and peers they must work with is key.  Working for multiple companies on a contract basis would thus limit their effectiveness.<br />4.  With all these contract opportunities, the book never discusses who originates these contracts (permanent employees, no doubt).<br />Contradictions aside, this book does mention some true points, but they are lost in the confused attempts to explain the bigger picture.	2004-03-12

There are many original great ideas presented in this book which stand alone on their own merit.

There are so many transitions in most companies in any given year, that having a process that makes more transitions successful and the new employees effective sooner should noticeably improve the bottom line.  Most importantly, this book makes you think!<br />Also noteworthy in this book is its straightforward organization- the book lays out 10 areas to consider during a transition, then dedicates a chapter to each, and concludes with a brief summary.

You can win every time merely by denying your opponent your permission to beat you.<br />I had heard that one should keep one's argument as pure as possible thereby avoiding to needlessly alienate people through issues unrelated to the main point.  The author contradicts this completely by sprinkling his liberal ideology throughout the book, making it significantly more difficult for non-liberals to keep reading.<br />In the beginning, the author says that this book is itself an argument.

The story of Dell Computers is an enjoyable story of how an entrepreneurial young Michael Dell couldn't contain his enthusiasm for his business idea and took it all the way.  Without much to guide him beyond his instincts he made some mistakes, but he admits to these and describes them so readers can learn from them as he did.  Of course, far more can be learned from what he did right.  One of the more noteworthy approaches he mentions is that Dell rewards success by *reducing* the responsibilities of the successful manager- an act many use as a negative disciplinary measure in other companies.  The reasoning is that after a division grows from a $10 million market to $200 million, by cutting it back to $25 million, it will be easier for the manager to focus on this smaller block, understand it better, and again grow it to $200 million or more.	2004-03-06

What do TQM, reengineering, empowerment, teaming, and even six sigma have in common?  They all implement parts of open-book management.  And that's the reason they all have spotty records- they were successful when they, accidentally, incorporated enough of the rest of open-book management.<br />The principle here is very simple- instead of your company or division relying on only the handful of minds at the top of the organization to improve the company, it treats all the employees as adults with brains and encourages everyone to work for the company's benefit.  This also has the effect of reducing or eliminating office politics since everyone's pulling in the same direction.<br />How?  Fortunately the process is pretty simple, though it needs to be tailored to each business.  The pieces are:<br />1. Giving employees all relevant financial information,<br />2. Giving employees training to understand the financial information,<br />3. Giving employees appropriate responsibility for the numbers under their control, and<br />4. Giving employees appropriate stakes in the outcomes (through bonuses, stock, options, etc.).	2004-03-01

The book identifies six basic styles of leadership and suggests how and when each of those styles may be used effectively.  This is good and useful information.<br />On the negative side, the authors appear so disconnected with reality that it is often difficult to take them seriously.  They honestly seem to think that emotional intelligence (EI) is the only important aspect to business and that personality, ambitions, abilities (other than EI abilities), and strategy are virtually irrelevant.  They never acknowledge many aspects of the real world such as some people don't belong in certain roles or organizations and need to be removed, ideally with &quot;EI&quot;.  Another example is that leaders need to be focused on the real world and not just emotions.  If assumptions about the market for a new product are found to be falsly optimistic, all the &quot;EI&quot; in the world is not going to replace admitting a mistake was made and pulling the plug.<br />While it doesn't have the emotional component, I'd recommend The Prime Movers by Edwin Locke to cover the other aspects of leadership that are neglected by this book.	2004-01-07

The news media is so left-winged that they consider liberal groups so &quot;mainstream&quot; that they routinely use them and reference them as &quot;informed, learned sources.&quot;  On the rare occasions that right-of-liberal groups are referenced they are labeled as &quot;conservative&quot;, &quot;right-wing&quot;, or worse.  Mr. Goldberg presents tons of evidence from numerous descriptions from transcripts to frequency of certain stories or types of stories in the media.  I think the book runs a little long and the last half to a third basically continues the first half to two-thirds, just adding more concrete details.  The audio edition also came with an interview with the author that added some fresh material, particularly dealing with feedback about this book.  The only significant downside to the book is the way Mr. Goldberg several times mentions the fact that the TV news media takes its cues from the newspaper news (NY Times, Washington Post, etc) but then no suggestion is made about how to address that problem.	2003-12-30

In this great book, Ayn Rand shows how to rationally interpret art.  That's not to say one piece of art can be rationally &quot;better&quot; than another, because rationally evaluating art involves comparing it with the values of the viewer. Since different people have different values, they can rationally disagree about art.  For example, my high valuation of reason is largely responsible for my appreciation of this book.	2003-12-26

While the book does mention the Microsoft products that could be used and have been used (which are now out-of-date) for KM, it does not really promote them. The book does not say that Microsoft products are superior to non-Microsoft products, nor does it even mention any features that Microsoft products have that many competitors don't.	2003-12-26

Anyone trying to learn from Ayn Rand's books will find that after one has read six or more, it may be difficult to remember where you read what.  Of course that is somewhat due to Ayn Rand's philosophy being consistent across her works.  This tool allows you to find memorable passages quickly.  This is particularly helpful when one finds a similar passage when reading one book and wants to compare it to what was said in another.	2003-12-15

Rather than starting out with an agenda, they studied hundreds of companies taking analyst's and insider's opinions for information about the culture and then looked at the results.  Probably the best finding was that the most successful cultures were those that valued all three interests- customers, shareholders, and employees- consistently.	2003-12-15

Further it has exercises to help one discover one's values and keep them more in focus.  The only shortcoming is the book's failure to show how reality precludes certain choices.  I recommend the book Viable Values by Tara Smith to cover that gap.	2003-12-15

The book can best be enjoyed by skipping the first section of the book which doesn't really pertain to the subject of the book.

While I don't think anyone (except the author) will agree with all of his decisions, he gives his reasoning and thus it is always possible to see his side.

How does one make money morally?<br />This book is far and away better than books by or about a single CEO because it looks at many leaders and clearly shows what is fundamental, discarding the rest.  The same principles needed to run a successful company and build wealth apply whether one runs a modest store or a gigantic enterprise (or even a modest department in a large company).  In today's culture most people would rather cut down and sling dirt at those at the top.  It is therefore very refreshing to read why they should be admired and how to follow in their footsteps.	2003-10-12

Like most truths, these insights apply not only to large corporations, but also to small businesses, and even to individuals' personal lives.  One of these insights is what the book calls the hedgehog concept which involves focusing on the right simple idea.  Because the book applies this concept, it is a relatively quick and easy read.

No one can argue with trying to get more out of life.  But this book suffers from a lack of reasoning.<br />For example, on page 55 the author says that he wished when people said &quot;hello&quot; they would &quot;honor the greatest in each other&quot; and that &quot;every human being has greatness inside.&quot;  But just two pages later he admits &quot;he who praises everybody praises nobody.&quot;<br />Perhaps the author was thinking with his heart or gut, two other organs he believes as capable of thought as the brain.<br />For those who really want to unlock the &quot;other 90%&quot; in their lives, I'd recommend &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; by Ayn Rand instead.	2003-02-09

This is the first book I have read that clearly shows what interdependence should exist among strategy, operations, and the people process.

This book is a rational and well written investigation into the causes and cures for office politics. In particular, the author understands that everyone acts selfishly and goes on to explain how various policies either align people's interests with their companies' or turn them against each other. Among its many highlights are five real examples in the form of five people who had acted very politically, then been educated about the causes and cures of office politics, and finally asked to re-evaluate their actions. One of the surprising, and fortunate, discoveries of that was that 'political operators' generally tend to dislike honest environments as much as honest people dislike political environments. Another positive was a section entitled 'The Rule of Law, Not Man' which explains that topic well. Finally, there are some good quotes in the chapter headings such as 'conviction is worthless unless it is converted into conduct' attributed to Thomas Carlyle.	2002-06-23
