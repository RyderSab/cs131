In the book, Maggie, the main character, leaves Ireland after her marriage falls apart and moves to California to live with her best friend. While there she learns about Hollywood and the movie industry and experiements as she trys to break her good-girl image. Although the book is lengthy, it is cute, and goes by fairly fast. It is definately a fun summer read. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a fun, not extremely intellectual, beach book.	2003-08-13

I never would have bought this book if I hadn't loved the movie, and am I ever glad that I did. This book, a tale of an orphanage and two men, the doctor who runs in and an orphan who grows up there, is absolutely incredible. The book is inspiring, honest, and very entertaining. I read it over a period of time, averaging a chapter or so every night, and did not find it difficult to remember what had  been going on. Although the book is long, it is definately worth it. The story is creative and entertaining. You won't regret reading this awesome book!	2003-08-12

Another hilarious book continuing the  story begun with Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging. The British have always been great with humor (or should I say humour) and this is no exception. A Bridget Jones with a teenage protaganist. If you loved Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging, you will surely  love this  one!! It only gets better as the series continues!	2003-07-24

I found it incredibly interesting. The book traces the history of women and how the media has portrayed them. Although it is used in feminism and media classes, it reads nothing like a textbook. Although it is nonfiction, it is a quick, informative, entertaining, and engaging read. I highly  reccomend it.	2003-07-24

While it is about four single girls in the city, it wasn't nearly the fun book I thought it would be. Each of the four stories came across as very shallow, without a message, and overall dissapointing. The characters rairly had any positive traits, and were in general disgusting people one would not want to meet. The plots were pathetic, and the writing was not great either. Anyone would be better with Bridget Jone's, Nanny Diaries, Fashionista, or any of the other hot and GOOD books about a single girl in the city.	2003-07-19

This book was perfect for what I call the &quot;beach books&quot; or &quot;plane books.&quot; I found the book easy to read, entertaining (with many a wild antics), strong in the character area, and for the most part great. The story is of an NYU student in need of money serving as a nanny for a rich Manhatten family who while there falls love, becomes way too dedicated to her job, and far more involved in the family's personal life than she needs to be. I found this book fun and frequently hilarious, particularly as it reminded me of many of my friends growing up. I attended a stuck-up private school in a wealthy part of town, and had many friends  who were raised by their nannies. I saw lots of the truth in the book, while some stuff that was a little too close to reality, and thus a little scary. Overall the book is a great quick read. It is a little freaky when you consider how real the book could be, and slightly annoying that the ending just leaves you hanging. Besides that, it's awesome.	2003-07-18

It was great. It had an interesting plot, unlike most other texts I've read in a foreign language, and it wasn't too hard, so that with a little help from our teacher, we were able to figure out what was going on. I would highly reccomend this to any upper level German class, or someone who is jut looking for a good German book.	2003-07-18

I read this book nonstop while on a lengthy car trip. I found it to be incredibly interesting, informative, well-researched, and enjoyable to read.

Whether you are researching Steinem or just looking for an interesting non-fiction, this book is for you!!	2003-07-11

I did not care for it as much as the brand we had used in the past. My main complaint is about the explanations and example problems. I felt the explanations were frequently incomplete and after reading them over many times, it was still confusing as to how they got from point A to point B. I did not feel the sample problems were representative of the type of problems asked in the exercises for each section. On the otherhand, the problems were very wide-ranging which is nice considering many math textbooks just have the same problem over and over again but with different numbers. If you don't depend on the explanations too much and just need the book for the homework problems, this shouldn't be bad. And even if you do need the explanations and sample problems to help you, I did and I still maintained an A average in the course.	2003-07-11

This was the first book I read by Gloria Steinem (but not the last!), and I loved it!! I took it on vacation and found it to be the perfect book for a trip. You can read one essay at a time or a few of them in one sitting. They range in tone and style from the more humorous to the dead serious. And reading about Steinem's experience as a playboy bunny, and then Hugh Hefner's response to her expose on Playboy was worth the price of the book. This book is for anyone and everyone, it's awesome!	2003-07-11

I loved the movie, but only liked the book. It was one of the few times in my life where I would have to say that the movie was better. But at the same point, I have gone on to read the other books in the series, but only after they are in paperback. It's a very short read (took me only a night), entertaining, yet predictable, but still very cute. If you really liked the movie, you will find the book to be nice, but just don't set your hopes too high.	2003-07-11

(Real World Aptitude Test): Preparing Yourself for Leaving Home (Capital Ideas)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Educational &amp; Fun for any Graduate- I should know, I am one!	I was actually a little dissapointed when I saw this after opening the package in the mail. I was expecting something a little less &quot;words of advice for the next phase of your life&quot; sort of thing. The book just sat there in my room for about a week until one night I was bored so I picked it up and started flipping through it. That was the first sign of something cool-you can flip through it, it doesn't matter  where you start or what you skip. And it's a different format, it's a test, but a fun one (if you can imagine such a thing). The book tells you so many of those important little things that you might have missed somehow along the way on everything from changing a  flat, making a bed, diversity, to figuring out the percent of alcohol in a margarita. This book ended up being a really cool and helpful graduation gift. I highly recommend it!	2003-07-11

I got this in the mail a few weeks ago from a close family friend for a graduation gift. At first I thought it looked really stupid, but I was bored one afternoon so I just picked it up. It is so fascinating! Each section is short enough so that you can read as much or as little as you feel like. And it's really easy to skip around and only read the sections that interest you. Now I read a section or two everyday. It's a great book because it covers so much information in an interesting and funny way. The quiz format adds a little element of fun into the whole advice book thing. It's also neat how they end each section by telling you where to go for more info on something. Each section is informative and funny at the same time. And it covers really important everyday sort of stuff from basic cooking, to how to change a tire, to basic knowledge for credit cards. If you are looking for a great book for a graduate (of college or high school) this graduate is telling you to get this book!	2003-07-08

I was looking for one of those funny, quick reads, that are perfect for the plane or the beach, and I got exactly what I was looking for. This is one of those books that is perfect for people who enjoyed the Bridget Jones and Shopaholic series. The characters are well-rounded, the plot is creative, yet not difficult to follow, and the book in general is fun to read. I highly reccomend this book, especially if you are looking for something to read on vacation. It is a great beach/plane book!	2003-07-08

The two young authors tell it like it  really is (or was, as reading today you can see that the book is already somewhat dated even though it was only published a few years ago). They give a very fair and open-minded look at many feminist issues from dealing with different generations of feminism (and why they often struggle when working together) to whether it is good or bad that companies such as Mattel (makers of Barbie) sponsor feminist-oriented organizations. The book is highly entertaining, and even though it looks like a hefty read, it is so enjoyable and fast-paced that it will be done before you know it. The thing that makes this book really unique though, is the resource kit in the back complete with webpages, books, and addresses for just about anything a feminist of any age could be looking for. I highly reccomend this book!	2003-07-05
