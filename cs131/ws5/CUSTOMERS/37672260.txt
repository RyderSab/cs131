I have loved Carlyle's past books because they were dark, sensual, humorous, and manned by vivid,unforgettable characters. Not to mention that she put her own stamp upon the Regency Historical sub-genre by exploring things that most RH authors don't. But One Little Sin is very conventional. Carlyle's stunning prose is evident, but her beautiful characterizations and use of setting flicker on and off throughout the book, leaving me unsatisfied and confused as to whom I was reading. From the beginning of book, I found myself impatient to finish it, and highly anticipating the next two books of the trilogy. Like another reviewer said; One Little Sin is merely your typical rake/governess+cute baby historical romance.	2005-10-13

In short, Paris Hilton meets Sydney Bristow. What should have been a fun, action packed book instead was clunky,flat and uninteresting. The beginning half of the book was cluttered with flashbacks, coincidences and a clunky attempt at showing the establishment of the Gotham Roses.Coupled with the author's unneccesary attempts to make Madison seem more \\"accessible\\" to the average person unlike the aforementioned real-life heiress, an unconvencing and undeveloped \\"romance\\"(that frankly, I found to be unrealistic due to social differences--even in the 21st Century), and a distinct lack of risk in concern to the plot, this book fell short of what it could have been. The preview for the next novel reads a bit better than this one, which is why I shall continue to follow the series.	2005-10-13

To be honest, I didn't know this was a Christian chick-lit when I bought it and if I had, I probably wouldn't have picked it up because even though I am a Christian, I have found myself sorely disappointed in the fare because even in the gamut of protagonists, I have found no one I could remotely identify with--everyone had white-washed lives or there were the token \\"sinners\\" to be redeemed. That said, Emily Ever After seemed like a cute chick-lit novel from the brief blurb I read and my own experiences as a twenty-something living in the world. Like Emily, I've experienced brief twinges when placed in slightly uncomfortable situations where my faith could be mocked, but that is where she and I diverge. In the end I'd say why I don't do such-and-such and not feel ashamed to say it. And like it says in the PW review, Emily's faith is referred to in such a vague manner throughout most of the book that when she did use the \\"Jesus card\\", it felt false and slightly judgemental. As I continued to read the book, I slowly found myself becoming annoyed with the character and the situations she found herself in--as well as her reactions to them. Her \\"relationship\\" with Benedict and her un-Emily behavior made her come across as the same as any other boy-crazy young woman running through mainstream chick-lit novels(or worse,YA novels) and instead of the author's using this behavior to mature Emily in Christ, they prolonged the situation to the point where Emily's \\"redemption\\" was merely lip service because of the fact that there were absolutely no consequences from her actions--either professionally,personally or spiritually. At the end of the book, I was left scratching my head wondering where Emily garnered these observations of hers in concern to \\"naive,sheltered\\" Christians versus the \\"worldly\\" Christian she had supposedly become. Coupled with a heavy dose of the \\"small town=good;big city=evil\\" cliche and Emily never truly experiencing life outside of her bubble, Emily Ever After was a huge letdown. Though the prose was fluid and the authors voices were perky, the lack of characterization as well as spiritual growth hasn't made me a convert to Christian chick-lit. I'll take my mainstream chick-lit with it's actual(even though it's spiritual-less) character growth instead.After was a huge letdown.

Graeme-Evans was smart to distance herself from the stigma placed upon critics as writing thinly disguised \\"bodice rippers\\" by focusing on Anne's life in Brussels and her involvement in trade, but I found the entire book to be a series of too convenient coincidences to find any joy or enjoyment in Anne's triumphs. Of course Anne bowls every man over with her beauty. Of course she is able to bewitch the Duke of Burgundy. Of course she's able to dodge death. Of course Edward's love for Anne burns hotter than ever. And so on and so on until Anne's true nature was revealed: the author created a Mary Sue. Combining that annoying character trait with the oft-times awkward prose and proclivity for glossing over the important stuff(like the actual day to day duties of a burgher in the 13th century), I was vastly disappointed in this book. Perhaps out of habit I shall pick up the third book.	2005-09-19

But from the moment handsome inventor Nathaniel Chase became her unwanted business partner, Mara found his optimism and determination kindling hopes she thought she'd forever left behind-and a passion that was putting everything she treasured at risk.\\"<br /><br />Words cannot explain how much this book blew me away. I bought this book because I'd read Gurhke's Avon releases, and while I wasn't 100% bowled over by them, I enjoyed the author's writing. To Dream Again made me a believer in LLG. TDA is no ordinary Victorian set historical romance--it's so much more. From the well-drawn villan, to the heartbreaking and emotional romance between Mara and Nathaniel, to the vividly drawn characterizations of the protagonists, and the wonderful conclusion to the novel, To Dream Again was superb.

This book began with a bang: an unapologetic yet endearing hero and the self-assured, smolderingly beautiful heroine and their electrifying first encounter. After their intitial (humorous I admit) entanglements in Kent, after the disappearance of the heroine's niece, the story fell apart, turning Charlotte(the heroine) into a sobbing mess and Stuart(the hero) into a semi-cliched and hollow character. The plot then ran amouk and the only thing that stood out amongst the confusion was the fact that Charlotte remained aggressive sexually--a rare occurance in a romance novel. But for a debut author, Linden shows promise and talent and I shall pick up her next novel.	2005-08-10

My primary reading choices for the past two years have been in the romance genre--historical romance in particular--and I picked this book up not because I assumed it was a historical romantic novel, but because I am a fan of well written historical fiction. The romance between Anne and Edward was an added bonus to an already intriguing novel. Most likely because I have a background in the romance genre, I found the sex and the romance not distasteful, in fact finding that it drew a defter hand in concern to the characters and their motivations. And for those who complain that \\"The Innocent\\" reads like a \\"romance\\" novel, not so, nearly everything that occured in this novel, even down to the detail to the history, is not something commonly found in the historical romance genre if I may be truthful. I recommend this novel to anyone with a love for history, a female protagonist strong for her times, and a warm love story that heightens the tension of the plot. I look forward to reading the second novel.	2005-07-01

The skill with which Hickey was able to create the mood of the period and social subjects was amazing and IMO, shot the book far above drier historical fiction.

Why does this book deserve a second read before passing judgement?<br /><br />Because the secrets, at first glance seem flimsy and unsubstantial in comparison to the Gothics of the past upon which this book is very, very loosely based upon(not to mention the tendency for fantastical, if improbable, secrets in modern romances). But in a second read, and placing the characters in their historical context, I was better able to understand why exactly their pasts had caused them to close themselves away from the world.<br /><br />The comparisons of Joyce to Judith Ivory are flimsy at best, and the only thing linking them together in my opinion, are the exquisite care they take to gently and sometimes painfully peel the layers away from their characters in order for them to grow and mature.<br /><br />The only quibble I have with this book is the fact that the love scenes lack a certain luster and relish due to the fact that Victoria and Byron were closed-off and seretive even during their lovemaking, making it hard for me to find their physical relationship appealing.<br /><br />I advise readers to come into this book shed of any expectations that are raised even by the back cover blurb, and just read it. And when finished, read it again.	2005-05-30

Gaskin is a skilled writer, so skilled that even when tragedy continually strikes the main protagonist, one keeps reading because the prose is so that it sucks you in, it makes you want to read to the end. Though, the ending is often ambiguous and sad.<br /><br />I read this book a while ago, but it left a very strong impression in my mind not only because of Gaskin's prose and her strong female protagonist, but because it was one of the few books that have made me angry. Beginning in turn of the century England and ending in 1920s American, this is the story of Lally, the slum orpham Black Jack, an industrialist, impulsively adopts to become a sibling to his son and daughter. His son is noble, handsome a brave; his daughter, spoilt, beautiful and vain. As the years pass by, Lally grows from child to plump wallflower, in love with the boy(now man) with whom she was raised as a sister. The story turns into WWI and Lally, due to an illness as a nurse, finds herself slim and beautiful for the first time in her life, and thankfully, her \\"brother\\" finally notices her as the woman she is. They fall in love and marry, soon having a son. Lally's \\"sister\\" Violet(I think her name was) has also married and has a son, but she neglects family life in order to take advantage of the rip-roaring fun of the 1920s. Violet's selfishness causes tragedy in Lally's life as her husband is killed in a car crash due to Violet's drunkeness. Heartbroken and numb, Lally follows Violet to America, where she meets an American who is interested in her. Unable to love anyone but her late husband, Lally ignores him, wrapping her life into that of her son. But tragedy strikes once more with the death of her son(and yet Violet's son gets to live).<br /><br />With this book, I officially retired from reading sagas, a genre I innocently fell into as I browsed the library. But now that I've read more than 8 with death and tragedy, I will never read one ever again. It amazes me that these types of books were so popular in the 70s and 80s(and still are to this day in England). I would recommend this to life long saga readers, but to those who feel jipped at the thought of reading books with ambiguous and near horrible endings, stay away from this book and anything like it.and tragedy, I will never read one ever again.

Firstly, I really, really loved how author Lee did not have the heroine, Lydia, see the hero, Ru Chan, as \\"he was chinese, with slanted eyes and yellow skin.\\" I tend to stay away from interracial romances because most of the time, the authors feel the need to constantly remind the reader that one of the characters isn't white. So Lee recieved an automatic thumbs up from me. Regarding the rest of the story, it was luscious, very sensual and the relationship between the protagonists was very realistic. I enjoyed the elements of Shanghai, as well as the religious and cultural differences between Lydia and Ru Chan that weren't used as a chance for the author to step atop a soap box. If you are looking for an erotic, rich read that isn't your run of the mill historical romance between two mature adults, White Tigress is for you.	2005-03-16

Abrams writes an exquite, deftly written tale of love,espionage and betrayal in Regency England. Though this is the fourth installment of her Regency set courier series and some old and familiar faces present along with the introduction of the main protagonists--Serena Allen and Julien Clermont--this is very much a stand-alone book. A scandal forced Serena to bury herself in the country on her family's estate, her uncle, the Earl of Bassington an important member of Whitehall and England's link to the unsteady European nations as England and Europe await the steady decay of Napoleon's empire. Under the pretense of being a butterfly scholar, Julien Clermont insinuates himself into the Bassington household, befriending the earl's young son, Simon, and bewitching Serena. But Julien's intentions quickly spiral out of his control not only in reference to his growing feelings for Serena, but in the fact that his original searchings for clues to his heritage unwittingly place him in the path of the dangerous thefts of important government papers, making Clermont a suspect in the treason. The twists and turns of the plot are deftly woven in with simple, yet realistic historical detail and an exquisitely scorching romance between Serena and Julien that keeps the pages turning. The pacing is slow, but the action builds upon itself as the chapters go, forcing one to remain interested in the procedings and also curious about not only the mystery of Julien's parentage,but Serena's own mysterious past as well as the looming mystery of the missing letters. Abrams isn't your typical Regency Spy Historical Romance author, and I heartily recommend the first three installments in this series.	2005-03-13

I loved how she twisted the usual tried and true romance plot of the heroine forced to be the hero's love slave because her brother/father/guardian gambled their fortune away. Instead, in The Pleasure Seekers, the hero is forced to be the \\"manstress\\" of a woman he lost his fortune to. The heroine, a lovely girl by the name of Bliss(very corny, but I could overlook it because this book is so good) stumbles across our anguished hero and the wager is on: if Caine can seduce Bliss, he can have everything he lost back in his posession. What I loved about this was that Caine, in his attempts to seduce Bliss, ended up getting to know her. A somewhat cliched plot twist later, finds Bliss living in Paris. But her independent life there more than made up for that earlier plot twist. The hero is forced to grovel and I loved it. The Pleasure Seekers is bold, passionate and very sensual.

The heroine's pain over her unrequited love for the hero would have rang true had we been shown why she felt the way she did about herself instead of being told. The hero was quite dim at times, but his redeeming quality was that he was immune to the villaness' evil doings towards the heroine. If the heroine hadn't spent so much time pouting over how unworthy and unlovely she was for the hero, TAoS would have been an entertaining read.

Unfortunately, this book did not live up to its predecessor. Naughty or Nice uses the most over used plot device in historical romance: the feisty ward and the jaded guardian, and does nothing to change the cliched-ness of the hackneyed plot device.Fancy and Lucian are cliched from the beginning of the book and by the end, are just plain carictures of themselves. The reasons for Fancy's disguise are inane and silly and Lucian was nearly over the border of cliched embittered rake. But the biggest wallop I had to swallow was the book's lack of historical wallpaper. TPS was obviously set in the Victorian era, but NoN was all over the place. If you've never read George's historicals, this isn't the book to start. Try The Pleasure Seekers, a compelling and sexy read.

Regardless of the sometimes belief stretching antics of vampires, Banks has done it again! But you can't say that she hasn't taken the vampire lore and made it her own. What I love about this series is how it is truly set in a world of good vs. evil as opposed to the usual snarky, witty dialogue and action of other vampire series'. Damali Richards is the new, badder and black Buffy, Carlos Rivera is the new, sexier and more powerful Angel, whilst the Guardians and the Covenant are a badder Scooby Gang.<br /><br />The Bitten started off with a bang, twisting our conceptions about Damali's role in the big game, as well as Carlos' role. The group fractured and split, but in the end, became a stronger, more loyal team.<br /><br />Banks ups the ante on the mythology, action and the sex in this book, and doesn't hold back on the religion part of it--which I appreciate.<br /><br />And standing in the middle of everything in this series is one thing: Love. Banks uses this powerful emotion as the salvation for this world, and I love it. If there is one series that is a must read for any vampire fiction lover, L.A.

A slightly more bulkier novel, it is surprisingly, a fast and tense read. Due to real life, I was forced to put the book down, and each time I did--no matter where I had closed the pages--I was left on the edge of a cliff, my attention focused on the next time I would be able to read this book. The Hunted was sexier, darker and grittier; finally allowing the passion between Damali and Carlos to explode in one of the best love scenes I've ever had a chance to read; upping the ante on Carlos' \\"life\\" and his deals; exposing more of the Neteru's heritage; and upping the tension between Damali and Carlos, Carlos and his enemies, The guardians and their chosen paths; etc, etc. The Hunted has taken Banks' series to an entirely different level where your emotions will be sure to run like a predator, unless you are dead.

I agree that CtA is similar to Blake's old plots; but when you think about it, most of her books were similar, but she was such an awesome writer, it didn't matter.<br /><br />I was excited about this release because I'd stumbled upon Blake's 70's, 80's and 90's historical romances in my local library and fell in love. Her novels were always heart wrenching, passionate, spiced with lovely historical details and set in the sultry climate of New Orleans. CtA had the New Orleans setting, the innocent heroine forced to bargain her virginity to the hardened hero; but it lacked the passion, the fire that her older books had.<br /><br />I really contribute it to her evolved writing style. I was disappointed in the book mainly because the way she wrote it is a 180 from the way she wrote her older books. Okay, I understand that she had to catch up with the times and readers' expectations of being in the heroine AND the hero's head, but Blake's old writing style was wonderful and witty and dazzling; and the change of it into the current mode of writing was the largest issue I had with this book. Because of this change, that was why CtA lacked the sparkling passion, it was why the historical details didn't feel as natural, it was why the hero and heroine lacked the mysteriousness they had in Blake's old books(especially the broody hero!).<br /><br />But I'll purchase and read the next installment; because I'm a huge Jennifer Blake fan. But if you want a serious, heart wrenching Blake classic; try \\"Spanish Serenade\\" or \\"Louisiana Dawn\\" or \\"Midnight Waltz\\".	2005-02-19

Banks tightened up the structural and craft stumbling blocks I encountered in the first installment and created a delicious world that Buffy could have been had religion and Bible prophesies been thrown in--and if Buffy was black (come to think of it, this series is less like Buffy and more like Angel). For doubters who hesitated to pick up the rest of the series do to dissatisfaction with the first book, The Awakening will definitely change your mind.<br /><br />Picking up where Minion left off, Banks starts this roller coaster ride in the POV of Carlos: a to-die-for master vampire with a lingering conscience and a love jones for Damali. Banks was excellent in heightening tension, weaving together plot points and making a slightly cynical romance reader actually feel the passion simmering between Damali and Carlos. The mythology was a lot easier to understand and the characters all stood out in this book as different entities as opposed to the semi-stock characters they seemed to be in Book One. A few dashes of humor in the book helped as well. Now I'm hooked, and hopefully, you will be as well.	2005-02-19

I was also happy to see that Minion was the story of a black vampire slayer, a story I was dying for Joss Whedon(the creator of \\"Buffy\\") to do, because while I loved SMG's portrayal of Buffy, I wanted someone I could _really_ relate to. From the first page, this book lacked that special something that should have grabbed my attention and kept it there. Instead, I quickly grew somewhat bored and spent about a week and a half reading this novel--an anamoly for me, someone who can read a 400 page novel in less than a day. I can point my main disatisfaction with Banks' slightly humorless prose and her bewildering way of taking for granted that the new reader knows what is going on. Damali's world is alot different from Buffy's world, and while that's a good thing, the way Banks introduced it to the reader was confusing. The action was written in a choppy manner and caused me to skip sections, as well as the very slangy dialogue being distracting. For some reason, reading slang became irritating to me, even though I hear it everyday. But on the upside, when the mythology wasn't confusing, it was well layered and the suspense of the fate of Carlos and his relationship with Damali(which is to be continued in \\"The Awakening\\") saved this novel. While I wasnt impressed, Banks will still be read for it's entertainment value.	2005-02-17

Where the previous two installments were saved by the author's delightful voice, the weaknesses in My Own Private Hero were glaring because of the absence of the author's natural voice. In an attempt to create a deep, moving story a la Edith Wharton, Maclean seemed to not notice that when emulating another author, one tends to end up muddying their own natural style.<br /><br />Because of this problem, the weak characterizations of nearly all of the characters, the tedious pacing, and the uninspired plotting of this book were obvious from page one. The pairing of a \\"good\\", sensible heroine with the wild, aristocratic rake is one that has been done a million times over, and seems to be one that readers never tire of, but in this book, it was just plain tired. The majority of the book's conflict was _told_ to us within the first three or four chapters, causing the remainder of the book to seem pointless. And the only \\"connection\\" between the hero and heroine seemed to be a tepid physical attraction.<br /><br />To be truthful, I found the \\"villains\\" of this book; Violet and Frances, to be more vividly drawn and more interesting than the remainder of the characters. I can only reccommend this book to readers who have to finish series', and those who like characters from previous books to appear in subsequent books. Other than that, skip this book.	2004-12-09

And what was even more pleasing: the fact that this book is excellent.<br /><br />Must Have Been The Moonlight is Brianna Donnally's story; the younger sister of the hero of the author's previous book \\"In My Heart\\". The hero, Major Michael Fallon is at turns enigmatic, sensual, honorable, conflicted and tender--a rare and exotic blend of character traits in the typical historical romance hero. Brianna, the heroine, is self-reliant, honorable, wise, and is possessed of a very down to earth sensuality that caused some very sensual moments in this book.<br /><br />From a sandstorm to the halls of an English manor, MHBTM never let go of what it promised in the first page of the book: action, scorching sensuality, passion between the hero and heroine, passion for life and the friction that comes between two people whose lives are entwined with each other whether they want to or not. Unlike another reviewer, I didn't find myself frustrated with the reticence on Brianna and Michael's side when it came to declaring their love because it fit their characters. I also was glad there wasn't the oft-cliched \\"show-down\\" between Michael and his vapid mother--that also fit the story and his character. MHBTM wasn't a romance where the hero's entire personality(or lack thereof) was wrapped within the vagrancies of his family and past. It was a story of two independent and honorable people who were thrown together and who found an unexpected passion and love.<br /><br />Another bonus was the vividly and near expertly drawn life of the British government within Egypt--one that wasn't sugar coated or washed over because the author was afraid of alienating those who mightn't want to read about the intricacies of the government and political system, as well as the tautly written suspense sub-plot. While the villain was somewhat obvious towards the end of the book, Thomas still kept me second-guessing my guess, and that was a delight.<br /><br />If you're looking for a passionate, vividly drawn characterization, \\"unusual\\" setting and tangible setttings, Must Have Been The Moonlight is for you.t was a delight. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a passionate, vividly drawn characterization, \\"unusual\\" setting and tangible setttings, Must Have Been The Moonlight is for you.  <br /> <br />	2004-12-09

But that's about it. As other reviewers have stated, this plot is overdone and has been done by much more talented authors. As a debut book, it's simple enough to attract the interest of readers who like this sort of plot, but for a debut author, the amount of patience it took for me to read this book was monstrously disappointing and tedious. I am a bit sorry to say that I am relieved that I didn't pay full price for this book. The premise of two aunt's thrusting their charges out onto the ton with a book they mistake for a rule book on getting engaged was humorous for at least the first two chapters. After that, it began to grow flat. Eliza and Magnus were on the brink of becoming cliched card-board cut-outs; only Eliza's semi-valid reason for not wanting to wed saved them. The sexual tension between the two was cringe inducing and written very heavy handedly for such light-hearted and \\"asexual\\" protagonists(The main problem I have with humorous/light historicals: the focus on the humor is so much, the sensualness comes across as odd). After the first few chapters, the \\"conflict\\" between Magnus and Eliza began to pall and quickly became irritating considering the fact that the conflict between them wasn't as pressing nor as anxiety inducing as the characters saw it as. Place on top of that, Magnus' irritating brogue--I was under the assumption that educated Scottish noblepeople were normally educated in England, or at least with English tutors/governesses, therefore eliminating their Scottish accents--and the constant intrusion of Eliza's pushy aunts, her sister and the man who couldn't make up his mind(or the author couldn't make up her mind) over whether he wanted Eliza or Grace, and you have the passable, sometimes boring Rules of Engagement. I would try another Caskie because I would like to see her improve with each successive book, but if I had to choose between an author who has yet to prove themself to write wonderful reads and an auto-buy author, I'd choose the proven and tried author.but if I had to choose between an author who has yet to prove themself to write wonderful reads and an auto-buy author, I'd choose the proven and tried author.	2004-11-19

I had high expectations regarding this novel; not only because of the author, but because the premise was so neat, and it sounded a bit like Sleeping Beauty--my favorite fairy tale.<br /><br />Clarice and Robert were very underdeveloped, the pacing was very slow, the villain/Robert's goal was very, very weak, and the love scenes between the two were way too early and way too unbelievable. They'd only met two-three days ago, as I recall, Clarice wishes to go home, she's forever spouting about being a princess, yet she sleeps with a man she barely even knows.<br /><br />Robert's character was irratic--I never knew who he was enough to feel any emotion for him, and his hazily described past. His immediate plan to use Clarice for his own personal vendetta became tiresome after a while, and then, the vendetta he wished upon his enemy was a big let-down;it wasn't even that dramatic, after all of the build-up about it.<br /><br />Plus; this series has remarkable similarities to Connie Brockway's Rose Hunters Trilogy: in the fact that they both features three impoverished sisters, are set within the early years of the nineteenth century. This book in particular was similar to My Seduction: heroine wanting to gain back her heritage through patronage of someone, a battle-weary hero who was betrayed by a comrade, and it's set in Scotland.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard Dodd fan, you'll probably read this book regardless of reviews, but if you've never read her, this isn't a book to start with. I personally recommend \\"In My Wildest Dreams\\" or \\"Rules of Attraction\\"	2004-10-16

It is only the characters that ultimately make this book fail. I felt that the only reason why Lizzie and Devlin's relationship progressed so quickly was so that Foley could plunge head-long into Devlin's revenge plot and keep Lizzie on the \\"side\\".<br /><br />On the other hand, Devlin and Lizzie come across as flat in comparison to their adventurous and climactic sub-plots. Devlin's reputation as a dark, tortured rake is underminded by his less than rakish actions and inner thoughts. I always felt as though he was a light-hearted, fun man hiding behind the mantle of a rake. Now, that was his plan, in order to infiltrate his enemies lair, but after every bemoaning of his guilt and fury over his family's death, he followed it up with joking and jollity that fit better on a man who wasn't bent on killing people.<br /><br />Lizzie was just so \\"Good\\" and \\"Understanding\\" that she began to turn into a cardboard, doormat. She only seemed to show spirit when Devlin and the Knight brother(forgot his name) began to compete in courting her.<br /><br />There was so much going on within this book that it sometimes overwhelmed me to the point of wishing that a good portion of the book/sub-plot had been cut out.<br /><br />This book is sensual, fun and climactic, but it left a void after finishing it. Foley has immense talent, but this should be read after her better installents--in particular her Acension Trilogy.	2004-09-28

Happily to say, this book was nearer to the feelings I recieved from AOFAG, but not quite enough to make this a keeper.<br /><br />Quinn isn't an auto-buy for me, nor is she one of my favorite authors, but I enjoy her for her sly humor and caper-like plots. And so I don't need to repeat that WHWW is a near 180 turn from her usual books.<br /><br />The first three chapters were beautiful, touching and heart-wrenching and I am amazed at the depths Quinn plumbed when writing Francesca's grief over finding her husband dead in his bed. I felt just as helpless as she did, and felt Michael's anguish as palpably as he did. But from there, the book didn't quite measure up to the first section of the book.<br /><br />During the read through, I enjoyed this book, but after I read the last page, things began to nag at me. Most of the love, and the love scenes and the sexual attraction was so one-sided for so much of the book, that Francesca's volte face didn't ring true. They spent so much time in agony--Michael because he didn't want to take John's place completely, and Francesca because she wanted a baby, but she didn't want to betray John's memory--that when they finally got together, I didn't care as much as I should have.<br /><br />A main issue I took with this book is the fact that I never got to know Michael or Francesca. What Michael found so appealing about Francesca was never ascertained other than \\"she had sly wit\\" or \\"her eyes were an incredible shade of blue\\". On Francesca's side, because she didn't see Michael as a \\"man\\" until near the end, their exchanges weren't one of two people tentatively exploring each other, than of two tense, grief, guilty feeling people--and they were each feeling those emotions for completely different reasons.<br /><br />The ending; when they were in Scotland felt extremely rushed. If this book had had at least 50 more pages of Francesca getting to know Michael as a potential bed-mate and husband as opposed to treating him like an old friend, I would have believed the love scenes as well as her declaration of love.<br /><br />Also, this book is deemed to be \\"Hot\\", but to me, they were rather tame, and in fact, a bit vaguely written if you compare them to other author's love scenes.<br /><br />If this romance had been less one-sided on Michael's part for a good portion of the book, had spent less time on guilt, and had spent more time on developing Francesca and Michael's characters, this would have been a powerful, intense romance. Unfortunately, the promise of the beginning wasn't lived up to through the remainder of the book.If this book had had at least 50 more pages of Francesca getting to know Michael as a potential bed-mate and husband as opposed to treating him like an old friend, I would have believed the love scenes as well as her declaration of love.  <br /> <br />Also, this book is deemed to be \\"Hot\\", but to me, they were rather tame, and in fact, a bit vaguely written if you compare them to other author's love scenes. <br /> <br />If this romance had been less one-sided on Michael's part for a good portion of the book, had spent less time on guilt, and had spent more time on developing Francesca and Michael's characters, this would have been a powerful, intense romance.

Her backlist has ultimately charmed me, but her recent Avon releases; One Night of Scandal and this one have fallen way short of the TM charm.<br /><br />This book had plenty of promise; a beauty and the beast type premise(though, The Bride and the Beast used it as well), a blind, tortured hero, and a no-nonsense heroine. But it began to unravel fairly quickly after the first meeting between the hero and heroine. Gabriel came across as less of a tortured, \\"dark\\" hero and more of a petulant man whose care-free life was changed simply because he wasn't handsome anymore. Samantha was a great character up until the twist Medeiros put into the book(which, btw, I didn't see coming *g*).<br /><br />The cartoonish servants(why, oh why are servants in Regency historicals so darn friendly?), love scenes that were watered down versions of Medeiros' previous sensual, richly emotional love scenes of her past books, and a last section that erased all of the charm and wit of the majority of the book and sadly, I found myself regretting that I'd bought this book instead of waiting for my library to obtain it.	2004-09-28

Barring the rest of my review of this book, the only thing that I was really disappointed with was the time period. While it was set in 1801, I felt as though this book should or could have been set in the 18th century and done just as nicely, or even better.<br /><br />The pacing in this book was a trifle shaky. The first two-thirds were achingly slow and intense with emotion, and the last third was fast, anxious and climactic. Because of the slowness of the first two-thirds, it took me a week to complete it. Kate and Kit were vividly drawn characters and the scenery was masterfully drawn, but the flashbacks were awkward and Kit's physical appearance was remarked upon much too often. The presence of a monastary in Scotland seemed possible, and so I allowed that possible historical oops to pass me by.<br /><br />After the only love scene--which was intense and emotional, though a bit anticlimatic, seeing as how it was so late in the book--the pace quickened at an alarming degree. The villain of the trilogy was hastily introduced and Kate's destination was thrust to the forefront. I do commend Ms. Brockway for her skill in not allowing us to fully know whether Kate would choose Kit or the Marquess, but it soon became a given when the villain began his villany.<br /><br />Because of the awkward pacing and sometimes spotty plotting; this was an average read for me. But if you are looking for an intense, emotional read with a heroine who isn't a martyr and a hero who has real pain, this is a nice book.	2004-09-27

I really hate that because it implies an acute lack of trust--unless the heroine has shown a propensity for lying about his family, I'd think that he should listen.<br /><br />But that's enough of that. I purchased AAMW not only because of the blurb and the cover, but also because I'd forgotten what a bland read To Marry the Duke was.<br /><br />The blurb promised an ellicit correspondence between the hero, Seger, and the heroine, Clara, but that only happened for one chapter! As a fan of correspondence romances(especially ellicit ones), I felt very cheated.<br /><br />I felt even more cheated by the utter lack of unique characterization and the same plotting problem the previous book had--it felt as if it were going through the paces.<br /><br />The only thing I can recommend about this book is the fact that it deals with something most historical romances don't: a hero and heroine who are in such intense lust, that they marry and forget about the relationship outside of bed. If the hero and heroine had been compelling and unique, that whole scenario would have made this book excellent. Unfortunately, it fell off of its track the moment Seger and Clara marry and Seger's aunt and cousin begin their inane and ill-fated sabotauge of Seger and Clara's relationship.<br /><br />Their machinations would have been interesting if not for the fact that Seger and Clara were already MARRIED and if his cousin had succeeded in stealing Seger away from Clara, she would have only been his mistress. So that subplot was so hilariously sad.<br /><br />Seger's rakedom was unconvincing due to the fact that it hinged on the weak fact that he had loved and lost. That reason would have been strong if his lost love had been used as a standard he held all women up against for the rest of his life, as opposed to a reason to sleep his way through the ton. Clara possessed a bit of the same characterization as her sister; perfect, highly sexed and a doormat.<br /><br />Topping off the suspended disbelief and irritation at author manipulation was the surprise character thrown in at the end. The revelation of love Seger had upon meeting this surprise character was too little, too late, unconvincing and too boring.<br /><br />This book recieves 3 stars compared to TMTD's 2 simply because the promise of MacLean's sparkling prose and dialogue was shown a bit more here than in the first book. The hot love scenes were a nice little additive, but not enough to make this book a stand-out read.s opposed to a reason to sleep his way through the ton.

If I'm not purchasing an auto-buy author or an author recommended to me, I depend on my gut instinct to sniff out a book that will knock my socks off. And The Perfect Temptation was it.<br /><br />I'd never read a book by Leslie LaFoy before, but I felt compelled to purchase this book even though the blurb doesn't describe what you will get when you read this book.<br /><br />LaFoy's style is so different from what you normally get from historical romances that it took me a while to get the rhythm. But when I did, I fell in love with this book.<br /><br />TPT is completely character driven. There may be twists and turns in the plot, but they are all steered by the characters. What I admire and love about this book is how woven it is. LaFoy doesn't throw Aidan and Alex's secrets, desires and background at the reader in one dose; I needed to read each line very carefully in order to glean what made these two tick. Every bit of dialogue meant something, everything they did meant something and it forced my mind to pay attention to this book and not wander for fear of missing something vital to understanding Aidan and Alex.<br /><br />Another bonus, was how sensual this book was beneath the tension of their situation. Aidan and Alex came across as two somewhat adjusted, mature adults who, while they acknowledged their sexual attraction, they didn't allow it to cloud their judgement toward each other. Therefore, when they finally consumated their love, it was a relief and they earned it.<br /><br />And before you think this book is heavy, it isn't. Beside the tension and the sexual tension were some very humorous moments.<br /><br />The book ended great as well. While Aidan and Alex recognized why they couldn't be together, they didn't accept it and took their destiny into their own hands, ending this book on a somewhat triumphant and wonderful note.<br /><br />If you are looking for a deep, intricate and \\"different\\" historical romance than the norm, The Perfect Temptation is the book for you.ical romance than the norm, The Perfect Temptation is the book for you. <br /> <br />	2004-09-24

Tightly plotted, believable characters, exact pace, interesting secondary characters(and even though there were two sequel baits thrown in, the weren't as obtrusive as they have been in other books), great dialogue and just a sweet,and subtly sensual love story.<br /><br />Emotionally, this book was flawed. I never felt very connected to Anthony and Daphne for some reason. The emotional tension felt lacking, and the tension of \\"will he or won't he fall for her and win her hand\\" was missing until Anthony arrived in London. The slower pacing was beautiful, but it also poked holes in the emotional bonding between Daphne and Anthony, and between the characters and the reader. After I finished this book, I was pleased, but it didn't shake my world up or make me want to instantly re-read it.<br /><br />But if you want a lyrical historical romance about a completely uncliched ugly duckling transforming into a swan and winning a supposedly loveless man's heart, this is the story for you. I didn't obtain what I had hoped from this story, but I look forward to reading more from Guhrke.	2004-09-24

MacLean has a clean, coherent prose and dialogue that had it's shiny moments, but the shoddy plotting and the one-dimensional characters overtook it most of the time.<br /><br />I would have believed Sophia's instant infatuation with James if his (false) courtship had been a contrast to the cool treatment she recieved from the English society. Consequently, once James has married, bedded and ignored her, she accepts his trickery of her as though she deserved it. Sophia is supposed to be a spunky, warm American to blow some heat into James' heart, but she came across as a doormat who would do anything for a man who had betrayed her trust.<br /><br />James' tortured past was very vaguely alluded to, leading me to be very skeptical of his behavior as well as his falling for Sophia at the end of the book. His one-dimensional character, combined with the fact that most of the book was in Sophia's point of view kept me at an emotional distance from him.<br /><br />James' family was cardboard as well and the \\"mystery\\" surrounding them with the French courtesan was sloppily done and read as though it was put into the story to make Sophia look like a hero and open James' eyes to how wonderful she was.<br /><br />All in all, this was a passable read. Sophia's doormat perfectness and James' vague aloofness, combined with hither and there plotting made what started off a somewhat sparkling and stand-out historical romance into a read I forgot as soon as the pages were closed.	2004-09-24

Balogh is a masterful weaver of stories and here, she is at her best. But there was no heart behind the words. The book left me feeling cold and unemotional. There was too much introspective between the characters and not enough action. Coupled with the lack of emotional intensity and the scorching sexual tension that SW and SS had, I couldn't get into this book. In fact, I found myself skimming chapters, not really interested in what was going to happen to Alleyne and Rachel.<br />The premise of the book was quite interesting, but the execution was poor. Another reason I found myself skimming was because the amnesia/hidden heiress/what-ifs of the book became very predictable. Even though I am not a fan of Wulfric's, I was touched to see his reactions to Alleyne's return, but that scene as well as the reactions of the Bedwyn family seemed disjointed from the very slow equilibrium of the rest of the story.<br />I am holding out hopes that Wulfric's story will satisfy my reasons for reading this series, but I am not too sure.	2004-06-21

However, the story seems to have fallen apart from the basic outline of the plot to its execution. Based on the blurb, the book had all the makings of a funny and charming novel, but there were so many holes in the plot and characterization that it ruined my experience with The Heiress Bride. First, I think the author might have some sort of predilection for forced sex, because not only did Colin force Sinjin into painful, unpleasant sex, but he was forced her into three times in a row! It's almost as though most of her male characters only know how to control themselves with their mistresses, but when it comes to wives it's all about trying to master them and bend their will. Secondly, the appearance of a ghost in Colin's castle was a little unnecessary, but I can understand its presence since the rest of the Sherbrooke series features the \\"Virgin Bride.\\" Lastly, though I enjoyed The Heiress Bride, I can only see myself reading it just this once. IMO, Coulter's only consistent Regency Historical trilogy was the Legacy Trilogy--the plots were amazing, the characters great, and the mysteries were engrossing. So far, only the aforementioned Legacy series, the Medieval and Viking series', and Coulter's stand-alone Regencies sit on my keeper shelf.	2003-09-26

The cover of this book grabbed my attention.eeing as how I devour books like food and had read all the ones by authors I liked I was searching for that one great book that would grab my attention and Aimee did it. From begginning to end I was hooked,I especially like how the narrorator's name wasn't given until the end of the book, that made it seem like she was talking exactly to you as if you knew her on an intimate basis. Everyone should read this powerful book.	2003-02-28
