US	52935844	R2EWKUWMVQ3KTE	0553587080	236523182	Haunted	Books	3	17	25	N	N	3 rating but only because of who the author is	I really did not like this book.  I tried for over a week to get involved in it and finally gave up. Haunted did not have anything that caught at me and compelled me to read to the end like the first two books in the series. I could not even develop a liking for Eve.   I loved Stolen and Bitten and have read both several times.  Dime Store and Industrial were \\"good\\" but in no way measured up to the first two books. I was really looking forward to reading Haunted, but ended up very disappointed.   I'm not giving up on the author though, Kelley Armstrong is a wonderful gifted writer and I hope her next book (Elena and Clay - finally - yeah!)will bring her back on top.  So I'm not suggesting to not read Haunted - just prepare yourself that it isn't as good as her others.	2005-08-15
US	52935844	R3IG0QFLOQ8Y8G	0060742550	26316081	Running on Empty	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Excellent and Exciting!!!	If this is her debut book, Lynn Montana's next book should be truly awesome.  Running on Empty would make a great adventure movie!  Don't miss out on this one.  I picked it up on a whim and I don't regret it at all.  When you don't care about being late to work or care about losing precious sleep because you can't put a book down and every little minute of the day is spent trying to fit in reading a page or two during work - you know you are caught in the middle of a gripping and fantastic story.  Congratulations, Ms. Montana.  This one should definitely earn you an award for best new writer.  Please keep writing!!!!!	2005-06-07

In the last two books Joan Hess wrote in the Claire Malloy series, I found myself more irritated by the characters instead of entertained.  Rather than purchase this one like I did the others, I borrowed it from the library. This one would definitely be worth buying. The Goodbye Body is more on the lines of her earlier books.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book even finding myself laughing out loud at some of Claire's comments and thoughts.  I would definitely recommend The Goodbye Body and I hope her next is as good as this one.	2005-05-23

It's nice to read a book where the main character is flawed or in other words - like a real person.  Her comments and actions brought a lot of smiles to my face as I read it.  I found the inside look at the lawyers and the insurance companies to be fascinating and scary. I already have ordered her second book and can't wait to receive it and start reading.  Claire Matturro has been added to my \\"must buy\\" list of favorite authors.  <br />	2005-05-23

I love this series and the author gets better with each book.   Gabe is HOT and is right up there and starting to edge past Janet Evanovich's Ranger and not quite but starting to trip on the heels of JD Robb's Roarke. (All in my opinion).  I love Grandpa and Ali the beer drinking ex-police dog.  This is a great series and if you want to have a guaranteed fun time - Jennifer Apodaca's Samantha Shaw's series is the thing to pick up - but make sure no one is around to interrupt you while you're reading!	2005-05-14

Definitely not up to the Stephanie Plum books and I think I really enjoyed the \\"Full\\" series Janet Evanovich writes with Charlotte Hughes better than Metro Girl.  With the Plum books there is sexy Ranger and Joe Morelli.  With Metro girl - Hooker in no way inspires lust or like and halfway thru the book the term \\"NASCAR Guy\\" was really starting to get on my nerves.  I hope she wasn't modelling Hooker on Earnhart Jr. because it really wasn't a very good compliment to Earnhart the way Hooker comes across in the book.  No, pass on the hardback edition and if you really feel you have to - buy the paperback or get it from the second hand store.	2004-11-18

Where Dead Run, Forbidden Fruit and Cause for Alarm were excellent, hard to put down books, All Fall Down was very hard to get into and stay interested in.  If you are just discovering Erica Spindler's talent leave this one for last and read all of the others on her list.  I would not recommend this book.	2004-10-07

I have read all of Iris Johansen's books and have loved them.  Picking up one of her books always was a guarantee that you would spend several action packed enjoyable hours.  This one, however, I could not get in to.  I tried several times, but ended up flipping to the end chapter and then putting the book in the \\"to give away\\" pile.  I hope that her next book - sequel or continuation of Jane's story - turns out better than this one.  To me, a major disappointment.	2004-10-04

Robb's Death series.  I took a chance on this just because I was looking for something a little different and I found it! I could not put it down and read it in one day. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series and can't wait for the end book by Susan Grant.	2004-04-19

The characters are so real.  The mystery keeps you guessing, but even if there wasn't a mystery I would read it just to be able to spend some time with Claire and Russ.  I can't wait for the next book to see how the author is going to handle the relationship between the two.  With Julia Spencer-Fleming's series, you get mystery, the experience of a small town life, religion, laughter, suspense and the tension of a forbidden relationship that keeps getting stronger.  I would definitely, most highly recommend this series.	2004-04-19

I read this in one day.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.   I'd like to see how the author handles future books with these characters.  I was glad to see at the end of the book the notice that her next book in the series comes in December 2004.  Something to definitely look forward to.	2004-03-01

It kept me smiling and laughing thru the whole book.  Love Bites was very good too, but did not have the same amount of humor as SWV. I would still highly recommend this book.  Lynsay Sands is definitely a wonderful author - She does humor better than any other author I have read. Now I can't wait to read Bastian's story.	2004-01-13

I had mixed feelings about it.  1. I really liked Zarek and the story did prove that to really know someone you need to walk a mile in their shoes. He had every reason to be as nasty as he was in the beginning.  My heart cried for him for what he went thru in his life. But with all that he had been thru for all of those hundreds of years - I would think it would have taken Astrid a lot longer to get him to come around to her than it did.  2. I agree with everyone - Simi was my favorite character.   She offered some smiles that were desperately needed after being exposed to what Zarek's live had been like. 3. I know it was probably just me - it was my first experience with the series but I found that a lot of times I had a hard time keeping the &quot;time&quot; straight. Reading about the goddesses and the daimons, etc. I felt like we were back in time and then Zarek would reach for a cell phone and it would startle me back into realizing the book is present time.  You would feel old world and then someone would mention a current tv show. 4. Maybe I haven't experienced that all consuming lust that Astrid and Zarek felt for each other, but if you were being chased by a creature that was going to kill you, would you go back to your house and then make love there - knowing the creature was coming?  5. I found that I couldn't put the book down, but I don't think this is a series that can or should be read out of order.  I'm going to go back and pick up the other books in the series and try to read them in the order they were written.  If I had read them in order, maybe it would have helped me understand it and the timing in history better and not leave me with the feeling of being off balance.  To many times I felt like the author was counting on you knowing everything from the past books in the series to understand some of the references she made to things and people. All in all - 4 stars.  I'm looking foward to finding her other books in the series to read them.  I would recommend Dance with the Devil, but if you haven't read the other books before this one, I would suggest you start with the earlier ones first and work up to Dance with the Devil.	2004-01-13

I've read fantasy books before, I've read books like Laurell K. Hamilton and Kelley Armstrong, so nothing is too far fetched for me to read.  But I tried and tried and very soon lost interest in this book.  There was nothing that kept my interest, kept me wanting to read to find out how it ended and there was nothing in this first book that sparked the desire to read the next two in the series.  I'm sorry, but this was not one that I would recommend.	2003-12-12

Brenda Joyce did an excellent job at keeping you off balance and almost breathless by the seduction scenes with Hart and the many ups and downs and turns in Francesca's life.  I don't want Leigh Anne to be out of the story.  I want Bragg totally tied up in that corner so Francesca will stay with Hart.  There were times when I wanted to hit her over the head - my goodness - who wouldn't want Hart!  Great story that had me waking up at 1:00 a.m. to finish it before getting up to the alarm clock this morning.  I cannot wait until the next book - hopefully coming soon.	2003-11-07

In the past I have liked all of Kay Hooper's books so I figured it was something that would keep me absorbed.  I have to admit that I had to force myself to put it down in order to get some sleep, but on picking it up the next day - it seemed to lose something as the story progressed. In finding out &quot;who did it&quot; I was totally disappointed and felt totally cheated. Upon finishing and closing the book I felt like I had wasted my time reading it. This is not one I would recommend.  I don't know why the publishers felt this one was worth publishing in hardback.	2003-10-27

I have read all of Elizabeth Thornton's other books and have enjoyed them immensely.  This one, I just couldn't get myself into.  I read half and then just skimmed to the end.  I guess every author is entitled to a bomb in their career and I think this is Ms. Thornton's.	2003-08-21

I was eagerly looking forward to reading her latest.  I made sure I alloted the time so I could read it in one day.  For some reason, the book could not hold my interest.  I had to force myself to get thru each page.  There wasn't enough of Grandma, Ranger and Morelli seemed like popup characters, now Joe is here, now he's gone, now it's Ranger, now it's not.  I'm not sure what the problem was, but I didn't experience the &quot;can't put it down&quot; feeling.  And didn't find myself laughing as much if at all like I have with the earlier books.  I'm still going to read her books, but I don't think I will be spending the money on hardbacks.  I'll just wait for the paperback version or get it from the library.	2003-08-18

Her bouncing back and forth between Hart and Bragg is a little irritating - both should just walk away from her.  But she is very young and naive...if someone who has hidden and watched two couples make love can be called naive......This is a great series.  I would highly recommend the Deadly books and the author (The Chase was fantastic!) I was glad to see that the next Deadly book will be out in the Fall of this year.  Don't miss out on this series and make a point to read the books in order to better understand the relationships.	2003-04-10

She is a fantastic author.  I had almost given up on romances because so many of them have little storyline and only sex, the heroines are empty headed, childish and irritating and the heros just not interesting enough.  But when I picked up Elizabeth Thornton's books, I was hooked from the beginning.  The Perfect Princess is the 6th book I have read so far (one right after the other) and it is definitely the one I like the best.  I have enjoyed all of them, but this one was the most enjoyable.  Richard Maitland was a fantastic, sexy, tough, non-perfect hero and Rosamund was one of the best heroines I have found in a long, long time. The interaction between the two characters was very enjoyable - from their fights to their lovemaking. I don't know how this one can be topped.  Maybe if the author wrote a book focusing on lovable Harper.  I don't really like reading books from this time period, but Ms. Thornton has done a wonderful job of combining mystery, romance, and humor that she has now been put on my favorite author list.  This one - in my opinion - is a definite winner and worth the reading time.	2003-03-05

Elizabeth Thornton is a very talented author.  I like her combination of mystery, romance and humor.  Her heros are sexy, tough and gentle.  Her heroines are not irritating airheads.

I love this series and can't believe it took me so long to find this author.  This is the first series in a long time that has me laughing and sometimes crying thru the book.  The warmth of the characters, their faults - they seem like real people and it didn't take long for the author to make you care about them.  I love Dirk and his relationship with Savannah.  Savannah is a tough but soft female and her side comments are what have you laughing and smiling.  This is a series that I hope is long run.  This author - with her first book grabbed a fan and with each book to her latest has moved herself up to the top of my list of favorite authors.  If you like Kathleen Taylor, Caroline Haynes, Rhett MacPherson, even Susan Cooper Rogers - you will like this author.  If you haven't read any of McKevett's books, start with Just Desserts.  After that they can really be read in any order.  But for shock value, read Just Desserts first.  Don't miss out on this wonderful and talented author!	2003-01-07

The mystery is solid and Joanne Pence keeps you quickly turning the pages with her writing style.  She offers humor and excitement from the 1st page to the last.  Though I wish she would tone Angie down a little to make her less irritating, Paavo keeps getting better and better and the other supporting characters seem to be further developed with each book making them seem like real people. Joanne Pence is definitely an author I would still buy in hardback.  The enjoyment she offers would be worth the hardback cost.	2002-12-31

The Dallas series is the best I have read.  I discovered this series late (after 10 had already been out) so I was able to read all of them one right after the other.  Rather than getting tired of them, I looked forward to the next one and next one.  J.D. Robb is one of the few authors who consistently turns out a suspenseful, humorous, romantic A+ story each book.  She never disappoints.  If you have not read any of J.D. Robb's books, it is highly recommended that you go back and start from book 1 (Naked in Death)and read in sequence. This will help you understand the characters better. So, sorry, no real review, just my opinion of the whole series. Purity and all of the books in the series are all lumped under one description - Fantastic! - any J.D. Robb book that you pick up is perfect.	2002-12-11

It seemed slow to start and the things happening in the book did not seem as suspenseful as they should have been.

I have gotten tension headaches from the suspense and action he puts into them.  This one, however, just didn't grab like his others did.  And the ending really didn't surprise me - I already had an idea of who it was. (Maybe I've been reading too many of these type of books.)

This series is far from boring.  It is fast paced, humorous and has a mystery which will keep you guessing until the end. In my opinion Malinda Terreri's Maggie Connors is running strong for 1st place over Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series (especially over Evanovich's last couple of books).  If you like Evanovich, Nancy Bartholomew or Sarah Strohmeyer (Bubbles), you will definitely like Malinda Terreri.  This book kept me turning the pages and laughing at her descriptions and remarks.  I can't wait for her next book and hope for a long, long series.	2002-11-13

The first was the Duke and I (I loved it!) the second was An Offer from A Gentleman (Equally loved it!)- the third, To Catch an Heiress -- I haven't even finished it.  I just can't get thru it.  Caroline seems more like an 11 year old girl and Blake at times seems younger than that.  I enjoy the romances where the hero and heroine spar off of each other - it keeps me interested, but this was just pure ridiculous.  I haven't yet looked up the copyright to see if this was her very first book ever, but I do know that this is not going to sit up on my keeper shelf with the other two of her books I have read.  I hope this is the only bad apple in her list of books, because I just bought all of them based on what I enjoyed with the Duke and I and Offer from a Gentleman.  This is a library or book exchange book only - do not waste your money.  Sorry.	2002-10-04

This author and her series is one of the best out there.  If I had to choose between spending money on food or on her newest hardback book - her book would win out!  Since the very first book, I have enjoyed her descriptions of the dogs and her little boy. Each book has gotten better.  There are so many different reasons to like her books,  the dogs and the descriptions of what is involved in dog shows, her relationships with her family, Aunt Peg, her ex and Sam, the mystery involved, her humor.  This is an author I would definitely, very highly recommend.	2002-09-26

Where I enjoyed Lady of Skye better than this one, Where Roses Grow Wild delivered the humor and witty conversations (not to mention love scenes) I enjoyed with the first book.  So much so I know I will be picking up her other books.  We can't all have romances where everyone smooches all of the time and never argues.  One it would not be true to life and two it would be very boring.  This was a very refreshing and enjoyable read for me and I would highly recommend the book and also the author.	2002-07-31

It is the first I have read of the author's and I am looking forward to reading her others.  I don't travel and I love mysteries.  Here was a book that gave me a good mystery and described the land and life on a ranch in Arizona with such detail I was able to picture it clearly. In doing that the author put this book far ahead of the &quot;straight&quot; mysteries.  In addition to the mystery, the descriptions of life on the ranch and Trade's interaction with her animals, helped keep the pages turning faster.  It was a very enjoyable read and I would recommend that you don't miss out on it.	2002-07-26

A married cop who finds a priest more understanding and fun than his wife. A female priest who drinks beer, curses and loves her sports car.  A very good mystery with plenty of possible suspects.  A suspenseful chase thru the woods at night during a snowstorm.  This was an excellent book and I hope the author is currently finishing up on the second book to this series and that the series will be a long run one.  The characters were like real people - flawed - human and more than just words on the page.  You could feel the warmth coming from them and found yourself laughing and smiling at some of the interaction.  I could not put this book down, but hated how fast it read because I didn't want to let go of the characters.  This book is very highly recommended.	2002-07-22

The humor was good - I liked the author's style, but the storyline was a little confusing at times and seemed to go around in circles a lot.  Her heroine came off more masculine and brave than the hero and for me that was a slight put off - a romantic suspense where I couldn't find anything attractive about the hero! I would definitely buy her next book because I think the author will get better. She has a good start with Pretend I'm Not Here.  I just think she needs to reign in the plot better.	2002-07-17

I was so glad I saved it for a vacation day because I was able to read it from cover to cover in one day without any interruptions.  This book kept me hooked from the first page.  The words created pictures so clear it felt like I was there in Australia. The book was interesting way beyond the mystery value.  You not only learned a lot about Australia, but also about survival.  You almost felt the thirst, the sweat, the tiredness as much as Tally did.  I would highly recommend this very talented author and book.  I can't wait for her next book!	2002-07-16

Of course I had to reach the end of the book at lunch at work today so needless to say the makeup needs retouching.  Mr. Parker's writing made Tim and Merci feel like real people.  You couldn't help rooting for Tim and wishing you could somehow help him beat the cancer.  In the ending you felt the losses as much as if the people were real.  Great writing!  Highly recommended.

Hamilton	I picked up this book mainly because of the reviews and because she was compared favorably with Tanya Huff's vampire series and Laurell K. Hamilton.  No Way!  Tanya Huff's was my favorite and I enjoyed Laurell Hamilton's up to the last three books.  This book did not have anything in it that caught at my attention enough to keep reading.  If you are looking for a good vampire book try the above two authors or Barbara Hambly's two vampire books, or a book called the Vampire and the Cowboy.  This book I would rate as boring and just plain dumb.	2002-06-07

I can't wait to open Sound Tracks which I'm going to do as soon as I sign off.

I think this is the best mystery/romance series (after J.D. Robb of course) that has come along in a while.  It is different.  All of the characters have so much depth that they seem like real people and I am very glad to see that there are two more books to the series coming out in April and May of this year.

I really liked it (read it in one night) and was interested in reading her other books.  I started with Firestorm and did not finish.  Where all of Brett's sexual escapades are understandable considering the time period the story takes place in, his anger and how he treated Storm was something I did not like.  To me he had no redeeming qualities and I just couldn't go on reading.  I hope her other books are good and that the characters are better than this book, because otherwise the other three will end up with Firestorm at the book exchange unread.  I would not recommend this book.	2002-03-06

I think out of all of the Angie/Paavo books I have only not liked one.  This one was good (and strange)but I read it in one night.  Angie is ditzy and when you team her up with her friend, Connie, it kind of reminds you of Lucy and Ethel.  Paavo is serious, but his homicide investigations balance out the comedic adventures of Angie.  Angie's adventures always tie up with Paavo's investigations towards the end and Paavo saves the day each time.  I like these books.  They are what I consider light reading and the characters have real like depth to them where you really find yourself caring what happens to them.  Each book advances their background and you find out more about them.  The only thing that I consider irritating is the name brand mentioning in the descriptions.  That gets a little old.  Yes, we know she is rich, but please I don't care what brand of clothes, shoes, jewelery, etc. Angie is wearing.  All in all I would highly recommend this series if you want something light and fast to read.  The books can definitely deliver up some comedy and will get your mind working to try to figure out who done it.	2002-02-24

I read Gathering Lies - the first O'Brien book I read since that first series and really liked the book.  It was very good.  But Crashing Down?  I agree with one reviewer.  The author should have just written her own life story instead trying to fit it into a suspense novel about other people.  I found this book very dark and hard to get thru - meaning there just wasn't anything there - nothing compelling you to read.  I made it to 2/3 thru and just skimmed the rest.  I didn't like the character development of Nicky and I didn't get much in the way of a growing love relationship between Nicky and Callie. Her descriptions of the abuse scenes were chilling, especially since you knew from the forward that they were based on her own experiences, but the rest of the book seemed to be lacking something.  I tried to read to the end, but just gave up.	2001-11-28

I found that I really had to force myself to read it.  There wasn't the &quot;thrilling, have to read, leave me alone, can't put it down&quot; draw with this book as there had been with her first three books.  I was very disappointed in this one and ended up just skimming to see who the killer was.  Needless to say it is the first Kay Hooper book that has ever ended up in the bag to go to the book exchange.  I hope her next one is better, though I might just get it from the book exchange instead of buying it new.	2001-11-27

It was so fantastic, so gripping I got 3 hours of sleep last night.  I had to force myself to put the book down so I could sleep.  At breakfast, I picked it up again only to realize when I surfaced that I now had only 1/2 hour to get a shower, get dressed and drive the 35 minute ride to work!  This is the first book I have read by this author and it is not going to be the last.  This was incredible!  I am so glad I found this author!  Thanks so much, Amazon, for the suggestions of authors or I would have missed this great book.	2001-11-21

Especially Outlander - when I need a lift I pick it up to get my dose of Jamie! Those three books were fantastic and what got me started back into reading romances after many years of giving up on them.   Drums of Autumn I could not get thru - I have tried and tried since day one of the book being published and cannot get into it. I did not even care to flip to the end to see what happened.  Jamie seemed to have changed and not for the good and I really don't like Brianna.  This one was marginally more interesting - though the word tedious also comes to mind.  She should have stopped after the third book and when you wanted more about Claire and Jamie, you could go back and read the first three all over again.  If you wanted to know what happened to them, how their life together went you could finish their life in you mind the way only you want it to go.  The author has got to stop at some point - I personally do not want to read about Jamie being 75 or of Jamie dying.  Please don't mess with the perfection of the characters in the first three books!	2001-11-20

I love this series and the characters.  If you want action, humor, tears, all out enjoyment for a couple of hours - read any one of Nancy Bartholomew's Sierre Lavotini's books.  This one was fantastic - her best yet and I can't wait for the next.  It was definitely worth paying for the hardback and is now sitting in the honored spot on the bookshelf.  Thank you, Nancy, for the enjoyable time and for bringing in Moose Lavotini.... he added a touch a spice and mystery!	2001-11-05

I was very upset that Romantic Times Magazine gave this book a 2 rating claiming that there was no mystery until the middle of the book and the antics of the characters were just too much to stand.  I read this book and loved it like I have all of her Tory Bauer books.  This book did have a mystery from the very beginning and a good one that kept you guessing and wondering until the very end.  The characters are like old beloved friends that even if there wasn't a mystery I would keep coming back just to visit with them and enjoy Kathleen Taylor's writing style.  I can't wait for the next one and I hope she keeps them coming for years and years (maybe a mystery at the old folks home where Tory and Niel will be living?).  A highly recommended and enjoyable read.	2001-08-07

I bought this book because of all of the wonderful 5 star reviews from the other readers, but I honestly could not get into it.  I really liked Nick and all his interactions with the other people in town were good, but when it came between him and Kathryn it seemed so stilted.  I did not like Kathryn.  Maybe that's why this book did not keep my interest.  I forced myself to read to the halfway mark and finally just put it down to move on to something else.  I have very little free time to read and when I do I want something that is going to grip my attention and not let it go until the back cover is turned.  This just did not do it.	2001-05-23

Where I do not think Dancing with the Devil can be put on the same shelf as Laurell K. Hamilton and Tanya Huff's Blood series, it was still very good. The action - where definitely not as graphic as Hamilton's books - kept you reading - unable to say &quot;I'll read just one more chapter and put it down for the night&quot;.  After reading the last sentence I was glad to see in the next paragraph that there will be a continuation of Niki and Michael's story coming in December. A lot of things were settled, but there were a lot of things left dangling. I am looking forward to continuing the story to find out what happens with Niki and Michael.	2001-04-19

I am an avid reader and I have never found an author better than Susan King at creating worlds and people you cherish long after the book is closed.  She is a very gifted author.

I've put off reading it even though all of the reviews have been all raves.  I picked it up the other day after reading Nancy Gideon's Midnight Redeemer (excellent!) and found I could not put it down.  I loved Mikhail.  There is really something very appealing/sexy about a man who can be a beast/dangerous and so gentle and loving.  I fell for him immediately.  Raven I wasn't too thrilled with and is why my book rating dropped from a 4 to a 3.  A lot of the problems they had were caused by her.  But I really enjoyed the other characters especially Jacques and Gregori.  I would not count this book as a keeper, but I am eager to go out and read her other books in the series.  The author has truly created an interesting world/slant to the vampire stories.  Visiting the world of the Carpathians was a great way to escape from the real world for a while.  I hope her other books are as good.	2001-03-20

I have tried to read her earlier books because of all of the great reviews I have read but have never been able to get thru them.  Guys that say &quot;la petite&quot; just do not do anything for me. I picked up Obsidian Butterfly because I needed a book to read to get me through 3 hours of work (not a busy night).  I couldn't find anything else at the drugstore and grabbed Obsidian Butterfly thinking - oh well, I'll give the author one last try.  I could not put it down!  It caught me up and I really found it hard to put it down when it was time to go home.  Edward was fantastic and I think he was the major drawer for me to finish the book.  I have since picked up the three other books another reviewer mentioned Edward was in.  I thought the book was a little too long but I did really enjoy it despite some disturbing scenes.  The author has a very easy style and I like the first person method where it feels as if the main character is talking directly to you. I know I probably should have read the books in order, but not doing so was really not much of a hindrance and didn't spoil my enjoyment.  I hope she continues to have Edward around.	2001-02-14

With a strong, sexy hero any woman would want to step out of the book into her life, a smart, level headed herione (no whining, no silly vapors), snappy dialogue, action and the interesting background of archaeology, this book easily won a 5+ rating.	2001-01-08

I guess I wasn't in the mood for it.  But I kept reading everyone's glowing reviews and decided to give it a second try.  I was definitely in the mood this time, because I couldn't put it down.  I really like Paula Baird Jones' books.  The humor, sexual tension, the situations she comes up with... makes for very enjoyable reading.  I regret my negative review from before. This time Last Enemy kept me on the edge of my seat.  I would highly recommend this to everyone.  I have Do Wah Diddy-Die and Byte Me to read and I am looking forward to losing myself in another page turner. I hope the author continues to keep them coming.  I put her up there (in my book) with Janet Evanovich and Nancy Bartholomew.	2000-12-27

I would put it on my list to buy and then when I would read the back cover I would take it off the list.   I would read the reviews from Amazon and put it on the list and then take it off again.  Finally, I just bought it and found I could not put it down once I started reading.  It was very good - compelling.  I kept reading just to find out more about Coltrane and what he was up to and how he was going to achieve his end.  This was the first Anne Stuart book I have read and as soon as I get done writing this, I am going to work at finding her other books.  I would highly recommend this book.   If you are put off by the mention of ghosts, don't be.  They really didn't play that important of a part - they were far in the background of the story.  If you are looking for a book with a sexy/dangerious hero and a story to completely absorb you don't miss Shadows at Sunset.	2000-12-07

It started out good, but then halfway through it lost something.  I found I didn't even care about the characters anymore and really just skimmed through to the end.  But this was an earlier book and maybe if I hadn't read Brider Finder and Night Drifter first I would have enjoyed this one more.  Please don't pass up this fantastic author because of Winterbourne.  Brider Finder and Night Drifter were 5 Star books in my opinion and I am eagerly waiting for her next book.  This one, however, I would say pass on it.	2000-12-05

Drag Strip offered non-stop action, crazy, lovable characters, mystery, romance and a gutsy heroine with a unique career. 'Just one more chapter'is something you can't do with this author's books.  Each chapter ends with action that means you have to read the next and the next until you find yourself closing the back cover with a smile on your face.  I am eagerly waiting for the third book in the Sierra Lavotini series to arrive from Amazon. Nancy Bartholomew is already good and with each book she gets better.  I'm sure by her fourth book, she will surpass Evanovich - at least in my opinion.  So if you have already read Evanovich's last book and you are looking for something to pass the time until her next one comes out, pick up any of Nancy Bartholomew's books.  Guaranteed if Evanovich and Bartholomew's next books come out at the same time, you'll read Nancy Bartholomew's book first!	2000-11-28

I thoroughly enjoyed her latest book, Unleashed.  Her mysteries are good, but I really think I read her books for the extreme enjoyment I get from her descriptions of life with her son and Faith, the poodle.   The behind scenes look at what goes on and into a dog show are fascinating.  Though I didn't exactly like the ending of Unleashed (as those of you who have already read it will know what I mean), I am looking forward to her next book and hearing what life is going to be like with a 6 year old, a 2 year old poodle and 6 poodle puppies.  If you love dogs, don't pass this wonderful author by.	2000-11-21

Though Gidget never cursed as much as Jaine, the whole book really did read like the main characters were teenagers and not older, supposedly mature people.  The only reason why I kept reading was because it was lunch time and I was at work and I only had the one book with me.  If this was the first Linda Howard book I had picked up, I never would pick up another one by her. I regret buying the book in hardback but some of the reviews were so glowing that I took a chance even seeing the few negatives.  I should have listened to the negatives.  I really don't get much of a chance to read, so when I can find some time I want to get into something really, really good.  With Mr. Perfect, I feel I have wasted my valuable time on trash.  Where I really wanted to give this book a 1, I opted for 2 because I did laugh at some parts.	2000-11-14

Hiding in the Shadows was gripping and kept you reading, but when I finished the book it was with a let-down feeling.  The ending was too far fetched and I think that fact kind of spoiled the book - for me anyway.  I would still definitely recommend reading it. Kay Hooper has turned out to be a fantastic author and I hope she keeps writing books like the ones in the Shadow series.  I'm looking forward to going home so I can pick up the third book.	2000-11-06

After awhile it just felt like it rambled until I couldn't wait until the ending.  I enjoyed the style it was written in.  Reading it felt as if you were talking to an older relative relating what it was like in their time.  Where Prophit Annie was good, if you want to experience a fantastic western story - pick up Ellen Recknor's &quot;Me and the Boys&quot; (out-of-print service).  I think Me and the Boys was way above better than Prophit Annie.	2000-11-02

It gripped you from the very first page and held on with a tight grip until the last page.  You found yourself on an emotional roller coaster ride laughing, biting your nails and crying.  The characters were fantastic and memorable.  I know I won't be forgetting Gini, Mace, Tuck, Zack, Malachi,Jingles, etc. for a long time.  I think Me and the Boys definitely tops Prophit Annie, so I hope they bring this one back in print because it would be a crime to let this book fade away into whatever void out of print books drop into.  If you like westerns and excitement every minute, pick this book up and meet some fantastic friends - you won't regret it.	2000-11-02

I think one of the highest compliments to an author is for someone to say they would buy any book the author wrote even if it was hardback.  That's what I have to say about Kathleen Taylor.  Her books are wonderful and even if there wasn't a mystery involved, I would read her books just for the pure fun and enjoyment of visiting with the residents of Delphi, South Dakota.  From the very first book, Sex and Salmonella, Kathleen Taylor gained an avid follower by her humor and her ability with words which enabled you to picture Delphi and its inhabitants so clearly.  Her characters are people you find yourself laughing and crying with and for.  Closing the back cover of the current book, you find yourself eagerly looking forward to her next.  Cold Front was just as good as her first through fourth books!  My only criticism is that things between Neil and Tory are going so slowly!   Other than that, I would highly recommend this author and I hope there will be many more books to the series!	2000-10-09

Her last book was one where I couldn't wait to finish it because I just wanted to be done with it, but this one was right back on track with the humor that attracted me to her books from the beginning. While I agree with one of the other reviewers that the relationship between Mandy and Stan seems to be going nowhere, it was explained in this book why he is so leery to become committed to her.  I think with time, they will start getting more involved.  Even without the romance, her books are enjoyable - how can they not be with the cast of characters - Betty, Mack, Honest Abe, Arthur, Nat, Spot...... I am very much looking forward to going home and picking up her next book.	2000-09-26

I really liked the characters in this, especially Darvish (despite his drunkenness in the  beginning). Though the growing relationship and feelings between Aaron and  Darvish made me a little uncomfortable (I would rather have had Darvish  lusting after Chandra instead of Aaron) I didn't let it put me off and had  a hard time putting the book down in order to do the necessary everyday  chores that need to be done.  Tanya Huff does a wonderful job of showing  what friendship and true caring is all about.  I hope she does come up with  a sequel to this, but if not anything else she does come up with will be  very good without a doubt.  You can't really go wrong with one of her  books.	2000-06-16

In Bad to the Bone I felt there was just nothing there that was able to hold my interest and keep me reading.  I put the book down  halfway through and put it in the &quot;book exchange&quot; bag without  even caring how she solved everything.  All of her other books I would get  up in the middle of the night after a couple of hours sleep to finish  reading - I couldn't bring myself to put them down.

I really don't think I have to say more.  Elizabeth Peters has done a wonderful job with He Shall Thunder in the Sky.  I just hope with all of the closures she will not stop writing about the Emerson family.  After all  of these books, the characters have become like family.  We have watched  Ramses grow from being an irritating brat to a very handsome, sexy,  appealing man - just like his father. It would be very hard to let them go  at this point and not know what happens further with their lives.  Again,  this book was the ultimate in fantastic.

Nancy Tesler has fast become one of my favorite authors.  Her characters are close to real life in how they interact with each other. The  relationship between the heroine and her cop boyfriend is a grownup  relationship where there are fights, but then both take the time to see the  other side and discuss the problems.  The mystery is good in that in all of  her books I have not been able to 100% figure out who was responsible until  it was revealed in the end. I put Nancy Tesler up there with Kathleen  Taylor and Susan Rogers Cooper two other favorite authors of mine.	2000-06-02

Murder with Puffins carried you along, but there  seemed to be a lot lacking from the first.  You read and felt like you  didn't get as involved with the characters as you did in the first book.  I  was able to pick this one up and put it down a number of times with no  problem, where with the first one I sat and read it from cover to cover  without putting it down at all.  After having such a wonderful hit her  first time, I know it must be hard to measure up to that the second time.   Don't get me wrong, Murder with Puffins was still a good mystery, just not  as good as Murder with Peacocks.  If you haven't read either of the  author's books, I would suggest reading Puffins first and then read  Peacocks which in my opinion was a 5 rating.	2000-05-22

It drew you in from the beginning and kept you reading even when you should have been sleeping.

Reading one right after the other because I enjoyed the characters so much I didn't want to let go of them.  But in the fourth book, I felt something was  lacking and I really did not like what happened at the end.  I'm going to  hold off reading the fifth book for awhile. Let the disappointment pass  before I try reading it.  The first three books are very good, so please  don't pass on them.  But pick up the 4th at a book exchange instead of  spending full price on it.	2000-05-15

I am so thankful I found this series!  I have two more to go and I am already getting upset that it's close to the end of the series.  I don't want to slow down.  I have read one right after  the other - never tiring of the characters - enjoying everything to the  fullest!  This book with the werpeople was very, very good.  Tanya Huff did  a wonderful job describing the wer's life and showing the families/packs  commitment to each other.  It had you cheering, crying and laughing -  especially at the antics of Shadow/Daniel. With not a lot of descriptive  paragraphs, Tanya Huff brings everything happening between the pages so  clearly into focus.  You feel as if you are there.  Even after the first  book, I found myself caring very much for the three main characters. Glad  that when I finished the first I had four books more to go.  This is a  wonderful series! Don't miss it, but make sure you read them in the order  they were written.	2000-05-11

I read these a little out of sequence where I read the third one first - so I will say again that it is best to read these in order.  In  reading Blood Price it gave me the background of the main characters and  how they all met.  I was not looking for a detective novel, I was looking  for pure entertainment where the real world could be suspended for awhile.   And I found it.  I really like the three main characters and am looking  forward to reading the remaining three books.  Tanya Huff does a really  good job at describing the many emotions and thrills in the book - from  horror, fear, despair, happiness, love, desire........I think she did a  great job.	2000-05-08

Tanya Huff has done an excellent job of creating characters you find yourself caring and rooting for.  Her portrayal of  Henry is very refreshing.  None of the melodramatic whirling and  disappearing and fang showing.  Her portrayal of Vicki with her eye disease  was a nice change from the perfect beautiful heroine who can do no wrong.  Her descriptions of the problems/life changes Vicki's eye disease has  caused her helped you to understand the character's actions better. And of  Celluci, hotblooded Italian cop who is tough and fights constantly with  Vicki, but could forget all danger to himself to protect her and keep her  alive.  Huff did a great job of creating depth to the charaters, especially  with Henry.  Though it was very frustrating at times to be in the middle of  the action and have to go through one of Henry's flashbacks to his past  before you could go on with the action again, it was a good tool in  building Henry into more than just a flat character in a book.  That's what  helped to grip you into caring about each one of the main characters.  If  you are a fan of non-erotic romances, mysteries and fantasy, then you can  find a treasure in this series which combines all three beautifully.	2000-05-08

I found that I really liked the three main characters and am interested in how they started out together and how it all ends.  Since  finishing Blood Lines I have placed an order for the other four books in  the series - so that tells me I considered it good.  The real telling point  for me was when I finished Blood Lines and couldn't bring myself to put it  in the &quot;used bookstore&quot; bag.  If you are going to read the  series, please start with the first book and read them in order.  Where  that is not really necessary, it does give you some of the history behind  the Henry, Vickie and Celluci and they do make some references to past  experiences.  All in all - I don't think this is a series that should be  passed up.	2000-05-05

If you ever read and liked Gayle Rogers' book Nakoa's Woman, please read A Love Beyond Time.  Even if you haven't read Nakoa's Woman, don't miss this book.  The whole time I was reading A Love Beyond Time, I kept thinking of  Nakoa's Woman which I read 20 years ago.  In my opinion, Gayle Rogers' book  was one of the best Indian love stories I had ever read.  I think A Love  Beyond Time comes very, very close to equalling it.  The author did a  wonderful job in creating the characters and making your feel so much a  part of what was going on.  She was able to keep you interested in the love  story and equally interested in what was happening in history with the  Lakota people.  After I finished the book I  did some research to find out  more about the Battle of Little Big Horn, Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull  (which is something I have never done before after reading a romance  novel).  If this is Judie Aitkin's first book, I can't wait for her next.   This is truly a keeper - a wonderful story.	2000-05-02

I was lucky enough that I discovered the series after the first three had been published so I was  able to read them one right after the other.

I think the  author did a wonderful job, especially with creating the feelings of Faith  in finding out she had been transported back in time and also of Miles'  feelings when told she was from the future.  The story has kept me on the  edge of my seat, not wanting to sleep or eat because I would have to put it  down.  She did a wonderful job.

US	52935844	R1FAEW82ZPIQQZ	0553569198	161730737	Body and Soul	Books	3	5	7	N	N	A good read	This was my second Susan Krinard book that I have read.  It in no way measured up to Prince of Shadows, but it kept you going if just to find out how they resolved the problem of David being a ghost.  There were a few  discrepancies in regard to Al, one comment being his &quot;pinned up  sleeve&quot; which led you to believe he had lost his arm, but then in  another part of the book it mentioned him putting his &quot;hands&quot;  around his glass.  He supposedly had to walk with a cane, but managed to  speed off through the woods... but that is just minor flaws.  The book was  good, but if you had a decision to make between reading Body and Soul first  or Prince of Shadows - please pick Prince of Shadows.	2000-04-11

I have always been fascinated by wolves and this book was everything I was hoping it would be when I bought it. I really like the romances that have the sexual tension, love, caring, and not every  page dedicated to sex scenes.  There was a good story line to this - good  development of the characters where you found out a lot about them and  understood and could feel what they were feeling. Krinard's descriptions  made you see things very clearly in your mind.   You found yourself  compelled to keep reading to see what would happen.  I have since picked up  her other two books - Prince of Wolves and Touch of a Wolf and can't wait  to start reading them.  Unfortunately, the guy on the cover of Prince of  Dreams has put me off from buying the book, but if the two other Krinard's  books are as fantastic as Prince of Shadows, I will buy it eventually.   Prince of Shadows is a wonderful book and one that shouldn't be missed.   Susan Krinard has definitely earned herself another devoted fan.	2000-03-30

I started reading it as soon as I pulled it out of the Amazon box and it was halfway through the book before I looked up again.  I finished it the next day.  It had humor, adventure, a  very appealing hero, an endearing heroine (after you got use to the fact  that she was very young) and the mystical, otherworldly quality that  reminded me of some of Katherine Kane's books.  I would definitely  recommend this as a must read and I look forward to her next book.	2000-03-10

I have given this just a 3 because I am still reading it, but wanted to say that the UPS man delivered this book right after I had finished Whisper of Roses, by Teresa Medieros.  I opened the book and started reading the  first page, just to get a feel of it.  I didn't plan on reading it right  away - I had already picked out another book to read, but I soon found  myself halfway through the book before I thought about putting it down.   Lucy's almost childish behavior kept putting me off at first, until I  reminded myself she was 18 years old, then I was able to get into it.  Even  though I haven't finished it yet, I am enjoying it very much and would  definitely recommend it as a must read.	2000-03-10

She is the best author I have ever found.  My number 1 favorite.  Where I did not think it measured up to Laird of the  Wind or Angel Knight, it was very, very good and well worth taking a  vacation day to read it.

Medeiros' other books (the first I had ever read by her).  I was so disgusted with her whining, childish heroine that I swore I would not pick up another one  of her books and couldn't understand what was seen in her writing.  But  because of the many raves about her Charming the Prince, I picked it up at  the library to read it (at no risk or cost).  I only have a few chapters  left to read, but I wanted to say that this book was very enjoyable.  I  found throughout most of the book I was reading with a smile on my face.   Her hero was what every woman dreams about and her heroine was smart,  spunky and non-whining (a treat!).  If you pass on any of her books, don't  pass on this one.  It was pure pleasure!	2000-03-01

Usually, I can agree with the other reviewers, but this one was very hard to get into.  I don't know what it was, but I  just found I could easily put it down and not care about picking it up.   When I choose housework over a book, I know the book is not good.  I tried  to keep with it, but skimmed the last couple of chapters just to get to the  end.

Kathy Hogan Trocheck is one of my favorite writers and this latest book was very good with the mystery, the suspense and the comic adventures of Neva Jean, Baby and  Sister.  However, my personal opinion rating of the outcome is a 1 as you  will understand when you read the book.  As in her past books, Kathy  Trocheck doesn't really hold any punches with any of her main or semi-main  characters. She writes things keeping true to real life, but in wanting to  escape into a book I don't like real life to get too close to the  characters I have grown to like after a number of books. But that's just my  opinion.  Don't pass this one up by Kathy Trocheck.  From book one she has  proven you can be great and still get better.	2000-02-25

Beaton's Agatha series, but after three attempts I can honestly say I do not like them.  The Potted Gardener I read because of the 5 Star rating but really found it about a 2 if that. Her best series is her Hamish MacBeth books.  I have read every single one  and have loved them.  The Agatha series does not have any of the  wonderfully real characters that you find yourself liking and looking  forward to visiting again. Agatha's relationship with James is very  irritating.  Where Hamish and his love for Priscilla just keeps you hoping  they will find their way back to each other. The three Agatha books that I  have read were flat/boring and I found myself flipping through just to get  to the end.  For a Hamish Macbeth book I would definitely buy it in  hardback.  Agatha Raisin - I don't even think I would pick it up at the  used bookstore...  I'm sorry, Ms. Beaton.	2000-01-04

I had bought a copy of Death of A Hussy a long time ago and never read it - keeping it in the back of my bookshelf.  I tried to read her Agatha series but didn't like it so it kept me from reading her Hamish MacBeth series.  I started getting books on tapes for the long drive to/from work  and one of them was Death of A Charming Man, read by Davina Porter.  I was  hooked.  Since then I have read all of the books after Charming Man and  after I read Death of an Addict, I will go back and read all of the  beginning books.  Death of a Scriptwriter was very good and with each book,  I have not been disappointed yet, with the mystery, with the descriptions  of the Scottish Highlands and its people, of Hamish MacBeth.  I hope M. C.  Beaton forgets about Agatha and writes double time about Hamish!  To think,  I almost missed these terrific books!  I would highly recommend reading the  Hamish MacBeth series.	1999-10-12

Abdullah's dire warning at the end was not very  encouraging.  After all of the books in the series you come to care very  much for the characters.  Some of the things that occurred in this one were  upsetting. I hope we do not have to wait long for the next book.	1999-06-17

But after reading the first three Amelia Peabody books I lost interest - mostly because Ramses was just too obnoxious and really got on my nerves.  His age and his  long-winded, stilted conversations (that did not seem to go with his age)  put me off.  BUT I decided to pick Seeing a Large Cat up and once started  could not put it down!  Ramses has grown up very much and instead of  finding him obnoxious, I am finding him very appealing with hopes that Ms.  Peter's future books will center more on Ramses,Nefret and David.  This  book was fantastic!  For once I was glad that my husband was working a  night shift because it gave me time to read without interruption until I  finished.  Once finished I quickly picked up the Ape in the Balance and am  now (impatiently) waiting for Falcon at the Portal to come out.  I would  highly recommend this book and her others!  I wish there were more authors  out there like Barbara Mertz!	1999-06-07

I was home all alone so I was able to read from cover to cover without any interruption.  This wonderful book deserved undivided attention and it  wasn't hard to give.  From the first page to the last, you were drawn in to  the characters.  I've chuckled through some books, but I have never laughed  out loud as I did with this one.  If this was her first book, I can't wait  for her next.  She has now earned the ranks of being one of the few authors  I will buy the hardback of.	1999-05-18

I love her books.  Heather Moon was not as good as the Laird of the Wind (1st) and Angel Knight(2nd), but it was still a very good read and  one I would rate as third after Angel Knight. I know to save any of Susan  King's books for a vacation day where I can devote the whole day to reading  it.  I think she is one of the best of the romance writers out there today.  I would highly recommend this and all of her books and eagerly  (impatiently) wait for her next book.	1999-04-13

Being an Administrative Assistant I can identify  a lot with some of the job situations Bonnie Indermill finds herself in.  It's fun to read a book where the main character does the same kind of work you do.  Carole Berry's  books are the greatest in that they offer humor and a good mystery at the  same time.  I don't even have to read what the book is about, if it was  written by Carole Berry then you know you are in for an enjoyable time.  I  would highly recommend all of her books.	1998-12-30

I found it fascinating that she would create a female main  character who was not &quot;perfect&quot;.  That in itself was a refreshing  change.  I thought the book was very suspenseful. You wanted to keep  reading just to find out how everyone was connected.  I definitely highly  recommend this book.	1998-11-24

I  hope she continues writing this series for a long, long time.  I look  forward to setting time aside to sit and read her books in one sitting  since they are hard to put down once picked up.

Susan King's Laird of the Wind is a beautiful story.  I could not put the book down.  I started reading Sunday night and ended up taking a half day off from work to finish it.  This is the first of her books I have read and I plan on reading all of them.  She knows what real romance and love is all about. She has not only created a story that pulls you in as soon as you begin reading, she gives you characters that stay with you long after you have finished reading the last page, and a wonderful glimpse of the history of Scotland. I truly loved this book!	1998-07-28

I like a true mystery, but the mystery seemed to take a backseat to the everyday wacky life in Alaska.  The mystery really didn't develop until you were almost through the whole book.  I don't think this was one of Stabenow's best.  In fact, her last two I have not liked.  Her first books were fantastic and kept you on the edge of your seat!    This last one was more like she was trying for something that could be an episode from Northern Exposures.  I would not really recommend this to anyone wanting to read a good mystery.	1998-03-25

I'm in agreement with the reader from New Mexico - Sally Gunning needs to write faster! Her books keep you turning the pages, but you hate to have them end.	1997-11-10

I carried it everywhere, reading it in elevators, standing in line at the store, in the car when stopped for red lights and heavy traffic, even taking it to the bathroom!!  I'm looking forward to her next book.	1997-10-31

I have yet to come across one of her books I did not enjoy. Her books are quick reads because they flow smoothly and hook you from the very beginning making them hard to put down.  If you are in the mood for a down to earth, easy to identify with book with humor and excitement, pick up any of Carole Berry's books.  You are in for a guaranteed good time.	1997-10-20

The hero is strong, brave, sensible, tender, caring - someone you would want to step out of the pages of the book into your life.  The heroine, however, is more often than not irritating in her stupidity, alternating between being a empty-headed woman and a preschool child. If you are comparing this book with other romances, it was okay.  It had some promise, but Tabitha still fell into the empty-headed female category.  If you are comparing this book with another time travel novel written - Outlander by Diana Gabaldon, it really wasn't worth the money paid or the time invested in reading it.  Diana Gabaldon is the only author I have come across who can portray an intelligent heroine to match her fantastic hero.  From the reviews of Touch of Enchantment and the author, I was ready to go out and buy all of her books and settle back for some enjoyable reading.  I'm glad now I only bought the one	1997-09-12

One day out of boredom, I was browsing the romance section at the bookstore and picked up Outlander.  I ended up sitting on the floor to read more and then ended up buying the book.  Books Two and Three affected me the same way.   I couldn't wait to get home from work, get dinner for the family, and then sit and read more about Claire and Jamie (especially Jamie!)  My husband kept asking me what I was reading and why I was smiling so much!  The fourth book I have not even finished.  I have no interest in picking it up.  Though I wanted to see Jamie and Claire's story continue and didn't want to give the characters up, I think I'd rather go back and reread the first three books than buy books 5 and 6.  Diana Gabaldon is an extremely gifted writer, but I think she should have stopped after three.  I personally do not want to see Jamie die or read about them at 70 or 80 years of age!  As to a movie?  Given Jamie's personality and looks, there is no actor on this earth who could fill his shoes!!!!!	1997-09-02

I have waited all of these years for another book to come out featuring Ingold, Rudy and Gil.  It was great!  Barbara Hambly is a natural storyteller.  The worlds she has created are so totally different from what we are use to, but with her words she makes them very real and very easy to see.  Her characters are more like real people than just words on a page. From the first sentence you find yourself breathlessly transported into the story.  I never hesitate in buying one of her books.  If it has Barbara Hambly's name on the front, I know without a doubt it will be an enjoyable read.  I look forward to reading more with Ingold, Sunwolf and Ysidro	1997-08-15
