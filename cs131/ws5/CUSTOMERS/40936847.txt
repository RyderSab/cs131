That said, I was happy to give this book a try as it dealt with an incident in Greek history with which I am not intimately familiar. Unfortunately, the writing of The Ten Thousand left me fairly cold and turned what could have been a good piece of historical fiction into the framework for a lousy HBO miniseries.<br /><br />First off, the author uses a colloquial style that, while it may have been comfortable for him, utterly fails to transport the reader back to ancient Greece. Spartan generals of 2400 years ago dropping the F-bomb over and over again is about as convincing as Brad Pitt playing the role of Achilles. No doubt, ancient soldiers used salty language. But there are certainly more artful and effective ways of getting that across. This also makes the book completely unsuitable for kids under age 16 or so.<br /><br />Second, the characters all seemed flat, neither well developed nor memorable, particularly that of Xenophon himself. Third, the segments which were supposed to be profound did not affect me as such. Granted, that could be a failing on my part, though Ford seems somewhat conscious of his own shortcomings and attempts to use a poetic device to apologize for it. His first person narrator is supposed to be an unsophisticated freedman, not well-versed in writing and one gets the impression that Ford himself is making the apology through his narrator. While this may be somewhat clever, it only tended to call the artistic deficiencies of the text repeatedly to mind.<br /><br />And finally, the romantic aspect of the book was confusing and seemed tacked on, when it wasn't just silly.<br /><br />Reading the book wasn't a total loss, however. It did make me want to seek out the Anabasis and read it, if only to see what Ford got right and wrong in the way of general historical accuracy. Overall, a disappointing but smooth read.	2005-09-08

Hundreds of years of anti-Catholic scholarship, hyperbole and outright fabrication has left the world with a notion of the Inquisition that allows it to be mentioned along side Hitler's Holocaust and Stalin's Gulags as singular historical atrocities.<br /><br />Though he himself admits that this book is inadequate as a comprehensive answer to the Inquisition myth-makers, William Thomas Walsh's book is indeed a good beginning. It traces the lives of several prominent figures of the Inquisition beginning, strangely enough, with Moses and proceeding to Pope Gregory IX, Bernard Gui, Nicholas Eymeric, Tomas Torquemada, Cardinal Ximenes, and finally Juan Antonio Llorente. Moses is included at the beginning as a way of demonstrating that the practices and techniques used by the Inquisition had their foundation in the Mosaic Law.<br /><br />Each of the biographies places the individual in his historical context. Rather than judging them by modern standards, the men profiled are placed among their contemporaries and their actions are judged based upon the prevailing practices of the time. Walsh makes it very clear that those investigated by the Inquisition were not non-Catholics, but instead those who claimed to be Catholics for political or economic gain, but spoke and acted against Church teaching. Heresy was a civic crime in Spain, and those found guilty of claiming to be Catholics while holding heretical opinions were handed over to the secular authorities for punishment.<br /><br />Though occasionally a bit jumbled and full of historical tangents, the biographies successfully paint the men named above not as bloodthirsty demons, but more often as reluctant prosecutors in a difficult situation. They were caught between the Spanish crown which wanted to seek out and destroy conspiratorial elements in society, both religious and political, and the Papacy which often demanded greater mercy in dealing with accused heretics.<br /><br />The final section of the book is especially interesting as it deals with Walsh's view of history from the Inquisition up to the time when he was writing in 1940 during the darkest days of World War II. This section is full of memorable quotes. For example, regarding the Protestant reformation, Walsh writes: \\"Heretical movements have never reformed the Christian Church. All of them professed their intention to do so; but invariably their effect was to confuse and destroy Christian doctrine-to dissolve Christ, in the phrase of St. John the Evangelist-without removing the human frailties complained of.\\" Walsh does go, perhaps, a bit overboard in this section in ascribing every evil the Church has experienced in recent centuries to a shadowy Masonic conspiracy. While I don't disagree with this idea entirely, the evidence he provides is simply not sufficient to make his case.<br /><br />Overall, Characters of the Inquisition is great place to start for anyone wanting an explanation of the Spanish Inquisition from a Catholic perspective.ous and political, and the Papacy which often demanded greater mercy in dealing with accused heretics. <br /> <br />The final section of the book is especially interesting as it deals with Walsh's view of history from the Inquisition up to the time when he was writing in 1940 during the darkest days of World War II.

While clearly a 'true-believer', Wilson treats his skeptics and critics with the utmost respect... even those whose sinister ulterior motives can scarcely be denied. The evidence offered in this book is compelling and thought-provoking. The now infamous 1988 Carbon-14 dating is laid bare for what it was: a poorly orchestrated effort on potentially contaminated samples of the Shroud which were snipped from an ill-conceived location.<br /><br />I especially appreciated Wilson's attempt to reconstruct a provenance for the Shroud, using art history and ancient legends to connect it to the mysterious Mandylion of Edessa--an image of the face of Christ which was supposedly discovered hidden in the walls of the city of Edessa in the 6th century AD. His research is well and thoroughly done and I, for one, think there may be something to it.<br /><br />In short, Wilson's work is at the very least, a masterful summary of the current state of research on the most famous religious relic in the world. Shroud enthusiasts and skeptics alike will be provided with much food for thought.	2005-06-10

It is well to keep this in mind when reading this work, as all the footnotes refer to works of scholarship from this period or before (obviously!) and much archaeological and philological work has been done since then. The reader should also keep in mind that Bury was writing for an audience that could read classical Latin and Greek, and therefore he includes passages in both languages that are not translated.<br /><br />This second volume focuses exclusively on the reigns of Justin I and his famous nephew, Justinian the Great. As with the first volume, Bury's scholarship is very impressive and wide-ranging and the book is extraordinarily useful as a general reference on the reign of Justinian. In format, it is somewhat marred by disjunction and lack of flow among the chapters. Bury begins with a history of the reign of Justin I, but then interrupts his narrative with extensive character sketches of Justinian, Theodora, John the Cappadocian, and others as well as descriptions of the church of St. Sophia, the Nika Rebellion, etc. For those lacking a basic framework of Justinian's reign, this can make for confusing reading.<br /><br />Bury then picks up the narrative again, successfully blending the sources at his disposal to give a coherent account of the Persian, Gothic, and Vandalic wars of the Justinianic reign. Toward the end, he gives excellent summaries of the financial and ecclesiastical situations within the empire. His overview of the great Justinianic legal reform is good, and would have been better if Bury had not wasted two whole pages decrying Roman divorce laws--this being a peculiar preoccupation for some British writers. The work ends with a very useful discussion of the major historians of the 6th century, Procopius, John Malalas, Agathias, etc.<br /><br />Bury's romantic attachment to Greco-Roman paganism is evident throughout volume 2, though it is better concealed than in the previous volume. The same is true of his dislike for Roman Catholicism, and particularly the papacy. He maintains, however, an annoying tendency to judge the actions of historical figures in terms of 20th century humanism.<br /><br />Overall, as long as readers are able to spot Bury's occasional biases with a clear eye, they will be well-rewarded by the time they finish this volume.is evident throughout volume 2, though it is better concealed than in the previous volume.

The original publication date is not mentioned on the title page, back cover, or anywhere else and may only be inferred by reading the author's preface. Dover would really do its customers a service by mentioning the 1923 publication date somewhere. The reprint itself is adequately done, though it would have benefited from some pre-press touching up as small bits of text have dropped out in a few spots.<br /><br />Overall, this is an extremely useful book for the researcher of the Late Roman/Early Byzantine empire. Bury covers all aspects of the empire during this period in adequate detail--enough to maintain a full and compelling narrative, but not too much as to drown the reader in minutiae. As with many scholars of his time, Bury was extraordinarily learned and an expansive researcher. The breadth of the sources he cites is indeed impressive, and every page is heavily footnoted. A 20 page bibliography is included at the end of Volume 2 that includes ancient historical and literary sources, inscriptions, and modern historical, literary, and artistic works up through the 1920s. This is very useful for pointing the serious researcher toward resources to provide additional detail on specific subjects of interest.<br /><br />Readers should beware, however, that this book was written during a time when it was assumed that most folks trained in the liberal arts would have a working knowledge of both Greek and Latin. This may be a source of some frustration to modern readers, as Bury retains many short passages in the original languages.<br /><br />The greatest weakness of this work is one that afflicts many scholars of the Anglo-American tradition up to the present day--a barely concealed animus toward the Roman Catholic Church in general and toward the Papacy in particular. Sadly, this bias permeates Bury's work, along with a not-quite-dispassionate attachment to Greco-Roman paganism that borders on the romantic. For Bury, it gets so thick in sections that it completely eclipses any semblance of scholarly objectivity.<br /><br />An example may suffice: In a long tangent from his main narrative, Bury presents a harsh critical analysis of \\"City of God\\", the monumental work of St. Augustine of Hippo which seems distinctly out of place. As part of his critique, he writes, \\"The main argument itself, although it has a definite architectural scheme, is marred by diffuseness and digressions.\\" It seems that the irony of such a statement, contained as it is in a diffuse digression from Bury's central theme, was lost on the author. And indeed, this statement makes for an accurate criticism of the whole of Bury's work.<br /><br />It is indeed unfortunate that many of the most celebrated modern resources in English for this time period were written by protestant/agnostic/atheist scholars with an axe to grind. Few works exist to hold up the Catholic argument--at least in English. Perhaps someday, a press will see fit to translate the truly monumental Ecclesiastical Annals of the 16th century apologist and historian Cardinal Baronius into English to provide some much-needed counterpoise to the easily available histories of Gibbon and Bury.For Bury, it gets so thick in sections that it completely eclipses any semblance of scholarly objectivity.

Packed full of the accumulated wisdom of a thousand years of Hellenistic and Roman experience in warfare, the Strategikon was meant to be a primer for the novice general--roughly the Western equivalent to Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War.\\"<br /><br />Simply put, the Strategicon is a gold mine of historical data on the Roman army of the late 6th century. It is of particular interest because this period marks a time when Roman power had made its last vain attempt to regain authority over the Western provinces of the Empire, and was now undergoing a period of contraction and collapse. The Strategikon describes an army whose core is no longer the heavy infantry of the early Roman Principate, but armored cavalry lancers and archers. It is a time when Greek was fast becoming the predominant language in Roman society as a whole, while vestiges of Latin remained in the jargon of the army. The legion of old was replaced by the meros, the centurion by the hekatontarch.<br /><br />The Strategikon records many aspects of the Roman army life at this time, including: induction of new recruits, description of ranks and responsibilities, formation of units, drills, rules, punishments, instructions on marching through enemy territory, foraging for food, and the set-up of fortified camps. It is rich in advice for the prospective general when battling against the various enemies of the Empire, from the Persians, to the Slavs, to the Avars and Goths. Perhaps most interesting of all, it contains several detailed diagrams for the order of battle of a Late Roman/Early Byzantine army of various sizes and configurations. It also gives a great deal of advice on how to defeat the enemy via guile, deception, misinformation, ambush, concealed traps, etc.<br /><br />All in all, the Strategikon is a source that can not be neglected for the scholar of the Late Roman or Byzantine army. The University of Pennsylvania Press is to be congratulated for making the work available in such an accessible and attractively-produced volume.that can not be neglected for the scholar of the Late Roman or Byzantine army.

Would that these same scholars took the same critical attitude toward works with obvious marxist overtones like \\"Chain Her By One Foot.\\" Anderson's book is little more than an attempt to cherry pick anecdotes and shoe-horn stubborn facts to fit a political agenda--in this case, marxism/radical feminism.<br /><br />Anderson claims that the task of the Jesuits in New France was to \\"introduce hierarchy, and thus domination and subjugation (into Native societies) where equality had previously existed.\\" She posits that Native American societies such as the Montagnais and the Huron nations were egalitarian societies before the Jesuit missionaries arrived to introduce the subjugation of women. To anyone who has more than a passing familiarity with the primary sources from this period, this claim is ludicrous on its face. It is impossible to say that the lot of women did not improve dramatically with the arrival of the Jesuits. While it is true that women possessed some limited political and decision-making status, particularly among Iroquois confederacy, time and again in the early Relations, the day-to-day lives of Indian women are described as pure drudgery. They are considered as hardly better off than slaves. Their main responsibility was to keep the house, grow and prepare food, and mind the children--activities which are often described as anathema to radical feminists. During menses, women among the Montagnais were sequestered in special huts designed to keep them apart from the rest of the village. Men were wary of pregnant women and shunned them, believing them capable of causing disease or bad luck. Men among the Hurons and Iroquois often derided other men by calling them \\"women\\" and avoided doing \\"women's work\\" at all costs. There are examples of this even in some of the earliest chronicles of the explorer Samuel de Champlain, so such attitudes can hardly be ascribed to European influence. During one council, an Iroquois captain was quoted as belittling the Delaware nation, saying that because they had been defeated by the Iroquois, they had been made into women--\\"We have put the skirt on you.\\" These few examples should suffice as a beginning refutation of Anderson's primary premise, but many more exist.<br /><br />Though Anderson claims at the end of this book that we cannot blame Christianity or western culture for the subjection of women, much of this book smacks of intellectual hubris where the poor benighted Natives are too docile or foolish to withstand the devious conversion attempts of the Jesuits. Of course, the actual primary sources tell a much different story--where the Jesuits were resisted by some Indians to the point that the missionaries were brutally tortured and killed. Meanwhile, some Hurons, Montagnais, and members of other tribes eventually embraced Christianity only after a long period of debate, instruction, doubt, trial, and rejection by family and friends. Women were often the first to take up Christianity, many suffering ostracism in the process.<br /><br />Thus, if you are looking for a flawed secondary resource with incomplete research and a blatant political bias, this book is perfect.

It is an excellent synopsis of the reign of that great emperor and his epic attempts to reconstitute the boundaries of the Roman Empire. Drawing mainly from Procopius and secondary sources like Bury, the author paints vivid portraits of the scenes and personalities involved: from Justinian himself, to Belisarius, Theodora, John the Cappadocian, Narses, and many others.<br /><br />Originally published in 1931, this book is a handsome paperback reprint. The text appears to be abridged as it contains numerous elipses (...) throughout. The author's writing style will seem a bit archaic to the modern reader and this tendency is highlighted by the antique-looking typesetting used by the publisher. The author freely injects his own opinions into the text, but it is usually very clear when he is doing so. He also uses some turns of phrase that seem remarkably un-politically correct today--such as repeatedly referring to Belisarius's force in Italy the \\"Little Dago Army.\\" In the author's defense, (and I say this as someone of Italian heritage myself) he was doing this in an attempt to mimic the Goth's deprecation of the Roman imperial army as \\"greeklings.\\"<br /><br />The only real drawback to this book is the dearth of footnotes, which makes it unsuitable for scholarly use. Having read much of Procopius already, I was curious where the author got some of the quotes and anecdotes he included which were not from that source.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, balanced overview of Justinian's reign that doesn't rely too heavily on the infamous 'Secret History.'	2005-01-05

This period saw the transformation of the Roman army from its classical infantry-dominated form to a cavalry-heavy precursor of medieval armies. It also witnessed a shift in strategy from frontier defense, to defense-in-depth. This book covers both of these trends in great detail. It offers a narrative history of the troubled third century, the reforming reigns of Diocletian and Constantine, and the barbarization of the army during the fifth century, quoting numerous ancient sources including Ammianus, Zosimus, Vegetius, Procopius, and others. It supplements this with archaeological data, maps, architectural schemes, and plates.<br /><br />Most useful is the thorough description of the arms, armor, and clothing worn by the Roman soldier during this period, coupled with photos of surviving bits of armor, helmets, swords, belts, etc. The authors also provide an excellent overview of how the dramatic changes in Roman society, economy, and law during this period affected the army.<br /><br />In conclusion, I found this to be an extremely useful book and recommend it highly.

This is a book for the serious historian of the late Roman/early Byzantine period--not light reading by any means. Unlike the histories written by the same author, this work is primarily a list of churches, towers, forts, curtain walls, aqueducts, sewers, harbors, etc. that the emperor Justinian I built or restored during his long reign. Its purpose was to glorify the works of this emperor in a particularly obsequious fashion. One must wonder when reading it, however, if Procopius was \\"convinced\\" to write this catalog of imperial achievements as a sort of ironic punishment for his infamous \\"secret\\" history which was penned several years before.<br /><br />For the serious historian, however, the book is a treasure trove of information. Perhaps most significant are the passages describing the great churches of Constantinople and the Greek east-particularly Justinian's masterpiece, Hagia Sophia. Procopius goes on to describe in detail the manifold improvements made at the command of Justinian in province after province of the empire. The list is, indeed, rather tedious if read start to finish. But if you're looking for information on the condition of a specific city in the Roman world during this time, chances are, Procopius mentions it.<br /><br />This edition of Buildings is especially useful because it contains a complete index to the Loeb translations of Procopius' works. One minor annoyance is Appendix I which describes a sketch of an equestrian statue of Justinian. According to the text, the sketch was included as the frontispiece to the original Loeb edition. Unfortunately, the 2002 reprinting which I purchased was lacking this interesting image-at least I couldn't find it anywhere in the volume. Somewhere, a careless editor needs castigating.	2004-09-30

What I didn't expect--or forgot--was the profound spiritual impact that the biographies retain even after 13-15 centuries.<br /><br />The book consists of translations of three hagiographies from the 5th through 7th centuries from the regions of Asia Minor and Egypt. Each is written by rough contemporaries of the saint in question or his followers. Perhaps the most fascinating of these accounts is the remarkable life of St. Daniel the Stylite. An ascetic in the tradition of his mentor, St. Simeon, Daniel spent the last 30 or so years of his life standing atop a pillar. There he gained a reputation as a living saint and dispensed wisdom and miracles to commoners, patricians, bishops, and even emperors such as Leo and Zeno. His fame was such that the heretical usurper Basiliscus was cowed by St. Daniel who came down from his pillar to issue a rebuke.<br /><br />St. Theodore of Sykeon was another ascetic miracle worker and reluctant bishop from the area of Asia Minor near Ancyra. He lived during the tumultous late 6th and early 7th century and, much like St. Daniel, he was sought out by the great and small alike for his wisdom and for his ability to cast out demons. This biography contains numerous examples of his battles with demons--who called him \\"iron eater\\" in reference to his strength and power over them. St. Theodore was well known to the emperor Maurice and famously rebuked the tyrant Phocas who had usurped the throne and murdered the family of Maurice.<br /><br />St. John the Almsgiver was a married layman who was called to the patriarchate of Alexandria after his wife and children perished. He was renowned for his outstanding generosity and care of the poor in Alexandria during a time of military defeat, economic collapse, and wholesale destruction in the Greek east. Truly, St. John \\"spoiled the poor\\" as Mother Theresa of Calcutta would later put it, and is a great example of charity and piety for us today.<br /><br />In short, this book is very useful as a historical document, as the stories of many famous historical persons are intertwined with the lives of these saints. In several cases, these lives serve as the only known record of certain events. However, don't be surprised if these biographies have a certain spiritual impact on you as well. While some of the anecdotes related seem to suffer from the hyperbole of oral tradition, most of them are credible accounts of incredible suffering, piety, physical endurance, and miraculous events. All in all, a great read for anyone interested in this period.St. John \\"spoiled the poor\\" as Mother Theresa of Calcutta would later put it, and is a great example of charity and piety for us today. <br /> <br />In short, this book is very useful as a historical document, as the stories of many famous historical persons are intertwined with the lives of these saints.

It is a well-conceived overview of the the Late Roman cavalry, examining its transformation from an auxiliary force to the core of the Justinianic Roman army. The numerous black & white photos of contemporary art and artifacts depicting arms, armor and cavalry soldiers in various states of activity help bring to life the text which is well-written and lifely.<br /><br /> Of particular note are the beautiful color plates done by Christa Hook. They are attractively done with tremendous attention to detail. My personal favorite is a scene of Roman medicine being practiced on three injured soldiers. This scene is taken directly from an account in Procopius where the procedure is described in some detail.<br /><br /> All in all, I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is especially useful for those with little to no knowledge of the period who are looking for a quick overview. The bibliography is also very useful and much appreciated.	2004-07-31

Chesterton not only proved that epic poetry yet lives, but that it can be readable and inspiring even to we jaded moderns. For me, reading this book was a great way to introduce myself to a period of history that was unfamiliar. The story of King Alfred and his desperate defense of Christian England against the invading pagan Danes is one that is not often featured in primary or secondary education (or college level Western history courses for that matter). But if not for Alfred, European history may have taken a decidedly different course. For me, the most compelling section of the ballad is toward the end where Alfred predicts that the Christian England he has just preserved will be threatened again in the far distant future by the forces of paganism. Clearly, Chesterton was not averse to taking shots at the contemporary post-Christian culture.<br /><br /> If you enjoyed this book, fear not. Good historical epic poetry is being written even to this day! The Laviniad (available on Amazon.com), an epic poem in the more classical tradition, is also a great read. Or if you like fantasy literature, try The Mask of Ollock, an epic poem in octet form.	2004-07-28

Lewis wraps up his &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; right back on planet Earth where it is up to a cadre of ordinary folks, mythical beings, and brute beasts to thwart the forces of supreme wickedness. With the assistance of the Director--a man familiar to readers of the previous two books in the trilogy--this strange collection of characters is pitted against a vaguely-familiar, propaganda-driven totalitarian regime ironically called by the acronym NICE.<br />This book is Lewis at his satirical best--an uppercut landed to the jaw of secular, anti-family, &quot;post-christian&quot; society.<br />What is particularly striking about this book is who Lewis fingers as the advance-guard for the evil that sadly dominates on Earth, ever trying to extend its power: a bunch of place-seeking, ethics-free, jive-talking academics who have long left any pretense to reason and science behind. Instead, they are driven by a misguided altruism that manifests itself, ultimately, as complete misanthropy.<br />In this regard, Lewis must be regarded as prescient. Anyone who has spent any time in American academia will immediately sympathize with the plight of the characters in the book who *dare* to stand up to the censorial, elitist, marxist/leninist, anti-religion, pro-death agenda so prevalent among the &quot;progressive&quot; leadership of the university. Lewis had these people's number fifty years ago.<br />In short, this book is a fun read and though couched in humorous terms, is deadly serious at its core.	2004-07-15

Lewis is one of those few writers whose works will be read, studied, and enjoyed 100, 200, 500 years after his death. He is both a fantastic story-teller and a brilliant philosopher--thus, his works deal with both the mundane and the sublime, often at the same time.<br />Perelandra is a good example of Lewis's ability to tell a good story while getting a higher point across. The second installment in his celebrated Space Trilogy (make sure you read &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; first) finds his hero, Ransom, swept away from Earth again on a mysterious mission to the planet Perelandra. Without giving too much of the story away, Ransom finds himself given the seemingly impossible task of preventing evil from Earth from polluting the pristine, unearthly paradise of Perelandra. To carry out this mission, Ransom finds himself grappling, both intellectually and physically, with a force of pure evil.<br />Let the reader beware: Perelandra is written in a more archaic style than we are used to today, and thus may be a difficult read for someone with a short-attention span. For a reader with an expansive imagination and a patient love for detailed descriptive writing, the book is a treasure and will be highly enjoyed.	2004-07-03

Lewis is one of the great writers of the 20th century and it's fast becoming the case that any truly literate person must be familiar with his work. Embarrassingly, I had never read his celebrated Space Trilogy, of which \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" is the first installment. Simply put, the book is a quick, enjoyable read as simply fantasy/science fiction.<br />Granted, it's not what most folks would consider modern sci-fi. Lewis hews closer to the classic format used by H. G. Wells than the sex and violence-laden style used by most contemporary writers. However, the true genius of the work is the philosophical/metaphysical themes that run just below the surface. Sadly, some of this was spoiled for me because I had previously been given a \\"heads-up\\" about certain specifics discussed in the series. For that reason, I won't go into them here in this review. I think the book is an even better read if you don't know what to expect going in.<br />Suffice it to say, that \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" is a wonderful book--intellectual but not heavy and overly grandiose. Read it. If you like books that entertain and make you think, you won't be disappointed.	2004-06-25

I had previously read Colleen McCollough's &quot;Caesar&quot; several years ago and had had mixed feelings on it. When I received a copy of &quot;First Man in Rome,&quot; I decided to give her another shot. Big mistake.<br />I remembered exactly what turned me off about &quot;Caesar&quot; within about 20 pages. Plain and simple--Ms. McCollough writes what I call &quot;porn for women.&quot; I'm not exactly a prude and am willing to cut an author a lot of slack when it comes to describing certain practices that were in vogue during certian points in history. But there is an artful way to do this and to put it bluntly, Ms. McCollough's approach is completely ham-handed and gross--worthy more of a Bob Guccione publication.<br />Don't confuse this stuff with literature or even good historical fiction. It's cheesy romance-schlock. If it's historical fiction you want, try Robert Graves's &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and &quot;Claudius the God.&quot;	2004-06-19

I got it specifically for the color plates in the hopes that they would help me visualize some of the descriptions that I had read in the historical sources. The book was at least somewhat useful from this perspective. The plates are fanciful but well executed. The photos included of Byzantine-era representational art and still-extant fortifications were also a welcome addition.<br />The actual text of the book was very disappointing. The author seems to have a greater affinity for the Islamo-Arabic and Persian peoples who lived on the frontiers of the empire, and it shows through time and again in the writing. He ascribes practically every Byzantine military accoutrement, weapon, unit organization, and tactic to foreign influence. Perhaps most annoying of all was the short-shrift given to the height of Byzantine military power under the emperor Justinian I. The author races right past this epic period to focus on the Arab invasions and Byzantine dark ages of the 7th and 8th centuries. There is no coverage in the text of Byzantine siege craft and fortification--two areas where the empire excelled.<br />I think the publisher would have been better served to have an actual Byzantinist write the text rather than someone whose familiarity with the subject seems tangential at best.	2004-06-15

It focuses on the Gothic Wars, giving a brief history of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West, the reign of Theoderic, and other events up to the beginning of Justinian's reign in AD 527. It then chronicles the incredible campaign of Belisarius who, with a pathetically small force, manages to subdue all of Sicily, southern Italy, and even regain the city of Rome itself for the Empire-lost since AD 476. The Goths under Vittigis rally and besiege Belisarius in Rome for over a year with (Procopius claims) 150,000 troops. But Belisarius manages to defend the city and defeat the siege in a sequence of battles and actions that can only be described as epic. Once the siege is broken and reinforcements are sent from Byzantium, the Roman army is able to push north toward the Gothic capital of Ravenna. The volume ends just as the Roman general Narses arrives on the scene. He will play an important role in the final defeat of the Goths in Italy in later volumes.<br />If you love classical or medieval history, you'll find this book to be an enjoyable read. The author, Procopius, was the secretary to Belisarius and an eyewitness to practically all the events he records. His style is fluid and the narrative includes many of the oddities and interesting tidbits that only an eyewitness can provide. For the serious scholar of this time period, this book is required reading. One should certainly read it-along with the rest of Procopius's histories-before picking up the Secret History.	2004-02-21

In the mid-5th century, the western provinces of the Empire had been plundered and overrun by powerful barbarian armies and Roman power had been usurped by Germanic kings. Hoping to regain what had been lost, the Emperor Justinian I embarked on a series of epic military campaigns in the West in the mid-6th century, spearheaded by his brilliant general Belisarius.<br />This volume, containing both books of Procopius's Vandalic Wars, details the the history of the African provinces prior to Justinian as well as the difficult, but ultimately successful efforts of Belisarius, Solomon, and others to reconquer and retain them for Justinian. The work details the conquest of the Vandals and the bringing of their king, Gelimer, back to Constantinople as a captive. It also deals with the many mutinies, Moorish invasions, uprisings, and sieges endured by the governors of the province after the departure of Belisarius. By the end, it is clear that the African provinces, so long a rich and prosperous part of the empire, had been largely depopulated and economically ruined by the ceaseless succession of wars and rebellions.<br />The author, Procopius, was an eyewitness to many of the events which he describes and offers insights into the actions that only an insider would know. However, he tends to be a bit credulous and considering the later &quot;Secret History&quot; which is rightly or wrongly attributed to Procopius, one is forced to read into much of what he recorded.<br />While I am not qualified to speak about the translation (my Greek is atrocious), I found the English text to be very readable and prosaic. All in all, this (along with the other works of Procopius from the Loeb) is required reading for anyone interested in the Late Roman/Early Byzantine period and helps make clear how Islamic armies were able to sweep through north Africa with such ease just a century later.later.	2004-02-08

After being force-fed books by ostensibly Catholic authors all through my ostensibly Catholic education that savaged the Church's history and traditions, it was indeed a welcome change to read this excellent history by Mr. Crocker. It would not be a stretch to call this a two-fisted history, written with flair and retaining an engaging wit throughout. Mr. Crocker obviously knows his stuff and staunchly defends episodes in Church history which are commonly mischaracterized and used as points of attack by the enemies of the Church. He even defends the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 by the men of the Fourth Crusade!<br />Perhaps the greatest strength of the book is that the author is not afraid to go after Luther, Calvin and the &quot;reformers&quot; with hammer and tongs. For a Catholic brought up in the &quot;eccumenical&quot; days of the 1970s &amp; 80s, this section contained a great deal of information that I had never heard before--and was very amusing to boot. Who knew that Luther was so obsessed with bodily functions?<br />All in all, I heartily reccomend this book. It's a good antidote to the anti-Catholic &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; that exists in society today, and is an incredibly fast and enjoyable read.	2004-02-03

We were given this book to read in high school (a Catholic high school, I might add) and I realized even then that it was a deeply flawed book. I re-read it later after I had informed myself on the authentic history of the Catholic Church garnered from a study of Church history and couldn't believe that books like this are routinely offered as textbooks to Catholic students.<br />An example of the kind of intellectual dishonesty contained in this book is the author's contention that the vocations &quot;crisis&quot; which we now face is primarily the result of a poisonous &quot;legalistic&quot; mentality left over from pre-Vatican II days. This claim has been rendered utterly absurd in light of revelations reported by Michael Rose in his book Goodbye, Good Men (also available on Amazon.com) and similar books on the horrendous state of moral laxity in US seminaries.<br />Indeed, if you are a teacher seeking a textbook for teen-aged Catholic students, selecting this book is doing them a grave disservice. If you're seeking a truly Catholic history of the Church that is also an enjoyable read, I recommend Triumph by H. W. Crocker (available in paperback on Amazon.com)	2004-02-03

More than a mere ecclesiastical history, it is a defense of Christianity written by a Bishop of the 4th century. Having lived through the persecution of Diocletian and been a confidant of the first Christian Roman emperor, Constantine, Eusebius recounts the tumultuous history of the Church in all its tragedy and triumph.<br /><br />Quoting from the early Church fathers, Josephus, and sacred scripture, Eusebius proceeds through the reigns of the various Roman emperors from the time of Christ down to his own time--a period of over 300 years. Among the most fascinating information included is the curious correspondence between Jesus himself and Abgar the Toparch of Edessa a city in western Asia Minor in which Jesus promises to send one of His disciples to cure Abgar after His ascension. Though of uncertain authenticity, the tale has been used in recent years to link the Holy Shroud of Turin to the Mandylion of Edessa.<br /><br />Also of interest are the numerous persecution, miracle, heresy, and martyrdom narratives that are packed into this book. The recounting of the marytrdoms of St. Polycarp and St. Justin Martyr are particularly compelling.<br /><br />In short, this book is a treasure house of information on the early Church and no serious student of Church history can neglect it. Note, however, that this book does not contain the famous story of Constantine's miraculous conversion--seeing a cross in the sky with the words, \\"Conquer by this.\\" If I remember correctly, this incident is recounted separately in the \\"Vita Constantini\\" also written by Eusebius.<br /><br />As for the Penguin translation, I am not qualified to comment. If you are in need of the original Greek, I recommend the edition from the Loeb Classical Library (vol. 265) also available here on Amazon.<br /><br />To read the subsequent early Church historians who built upon Eusebius through the end of the 6th century, check out:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0548246610 The Ecclesiastical History Of Socrates, Surnamed Scholasticus, Or The Advocate: Comprising A History Of The Church In Seven Books]];<br /><br />[[ASIN:1419117238 Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen]];<br /><br />[[ASIN:1419160559 The Ecclesiastical History of Theodoret]];<br /><br />and [[ASIN:1889758884 The Ecclesiastical History of Evagrius (Christian Roman Empire Series)]].ut:     [[ASIN:0548246610 The Ecclesiastical History Of Socrates, Surnamed Scholasticus, Or The Advocate: Comprising A History Of The Church In Seven Books]];     [[ASIN:1419117238 Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen]];    [[ASIN:1419160559 The Ecclesiastical History of Theodoret]];     and [[ASIN:1889758884 The Ecclesiastical History of Evagrius (Christian Roman Empire Series)]].	2004-01-31

For the vast majority of Americans, this combination of feminist whackos and Talibanic Islamic groups who view women as property was probably a bit shocking. It wasn't for anyone who knows that the left operates by one simple maxim: \\"In all things, hate America first.\\" One thing is certain--Ann Coulter knows how the left operates.<br />Well, if she wasn't there already, Ann Coulter has now made the hard left's \\"Most hated people\\" list. With this book, she joins the ranks of Ronald Reagan, Whittaker Chambers, Richard Nixon, J. Edgar Hoover, and Joseph McCarthy as people the communist left will be slandering and attempting to destroy even long after they're dead. Why? Because she points a cannon of truth at the bulwarks of hard-leftism and simply blows them to smithereens. Using meticulous research, Coulter demonstrates how since World War II, the American left has been steadfastly defending the most murderous regimes on the planet while demonizing other Americans who happened to oppose such regimes. She summarizes the litany of errors, lies, and slander the left has embraced to protect communist spies like Alger Hiss, the Rosenbergs, Harry Dexter White, and others while detailing the absurd lengths their willing accomplices in the media were willing to go to defend them. Perhaps the greatest strength of the book is Coulter's methodical defense of both the House Unamerican Activities Committee and Senator Joseph McCarthy, both of whom are shown to have been largely correct in their accusations of large-scale, high-level communist infiltration into the FDR and Truman administrations. Most importantly, Ms. Coulter points readers to recent resources on the Venona Project and the KGB files which prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that certain individuals the leftwing media defended in the 1950s were in fact Soviet spies. Referencing books such as \\"Venona\\" and \\"The Secret World of American Communism\\" (available on Amazon.com) Coulter puts the the naked treachery of many leftist \\"patriots\\" on display for the world to see.<br />With Treason, Ms. Coulter has done America a great favor. She has launched a ferocious and long-deserved attack on the totalitarian symps who continue to exist on the left and has done so with a sarcastic wit that makes her writing as caustic as it is incisive. Comparing this book to the drivel produced by mental midgets like Michael Moore and Al Franken does Ms. Coulter a grave disservice.<br />In closing Treason, Coulter goes farther afield than simple politics and offers with the following insightful comment:<br />\\"The fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives is: Conservatives believe that man was created in God's image; liberals believe the *are* god.\\"<br />For anyone who has spent hours debating a liberal friend, acquaintance, or family member, the truth behind these words is obvious.ces on the Venona Project and the KGB files which prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that certain individuals the leftwing media defended in the 1950s were in fact Soviet spies.

Recently, I was doing research on the Beaver Wars of the 17th century and learned a great deal about the history of the early colonies and the relationships between the various Native American nations and tribal groups. It's fascinating stuff, to say the least.<br />After completing the research (which resulted in a two volume set of books entitled \\"Iroquois Wars\\" available on Amazon.com), I re-read Cooper's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" with a more careful eye. Clearly, Cooper knew his stuff. He captures the true spirit of the American frontier spot on. He retains a mournful sensitivity toward the plight of the dwindling eastern woodland tribes while offering none of the absurd modern political correctness that makes every Indian wise, generous, and kind, and every European colonist vicious, greedy, and ignorant. While subject to the occasional novelist's hyperbole, Cooper also draws an accurate picture of Native military tactics and rituals. The various harangues and conversations he creates could have been lifted directly from the pages of the Jesuit Relations or other primary sources in which actual conversations were recorded by those who understood the various Algonquian and Iroquoian tongues.<br />In short, I highly recommend \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" to anyone who enjoys historical novels or those with a particular interest in frontier history, the American colonial wars, or the native tribes of the eastern woodlands. The book truly is an American classic. (P.S., don't bother with the recent movie of the same name--it bears only passing resemblance to this book).	2004-01-05

Originally written in 1946, \\"Madeleine Takes Command\\" is a true story of the 17th century Canadian frontier. With her parents away, it is up to 14 year old Madeleine de Vercheres and her two younger brothers to lead the defense of a small outpost against a surprise Mohawk attack. Based on actual events, this book gives us comfortable moderns a harrowing glimpse into the rough and perilous past.<br />The characters are charming, sympathetic, and perfectly in keeping with those real people described in the Jesuit Relations and other primary sources of the time period. Though Madeleine is truly a courageous figure, at no time does she become \\"Xena, warrior princess,\\" performing impossible feats of physical strength. Instead, she is able to preserve the family homestead with quick thinking, tireless energy, steady resolve, self-denial, an optimistic spirit, and devotion to family.<br />This Bethlehem reprint is attractively presented and includes a dozen or so illustrations. It's perfect for kids ages 10 and up, and also an enjoyable read for an adult. It makes great supplemental reading for the study of colonial North America and is highly recommended to homeschooling parents.	2003-08-04

Wheeler's interest in medieval history comes through in his vivid descriptions of the towns, taverns, clothing, and weaponry. His martial arts background comes into play in the well-designed fight sequences.<br />Most importantly, Wheeler's characters are complex and interesting. There is a definite line between good and evil, Forbidden magic and Earth magic, yet the characters are in no way one-dimensional. Though LANDMOOR fits in with &quot;clean fiction&quot; suitable for younger readers, it is not &quot;fluffy bunnies and lollipops.&quot; Not by a long shot. I thought Wheeler's creative approach to &quot;cussing&quot; added a nice touch of humor to the book.<br />The only mildly annoying aspect of the book is that the ending is a bit of a cliff-hanger. Clearly, LANDMOOR is meant to be part of a series. Fortunately, the world Wheeler has created is easily intriguing enough to support one with little difficulty.<br />In short, if you enjoy high fantasy, you'll love this book.	2003-07-29

I was also hoping for some in depth descriptive scenes of the battles which defined the career of Belisarius. \\"Count Belisarius\\" sounded like a book tailor-made for me.<br /><br />I was left disappointed. While the book had a lot of similar historical intrigue as may be found in \\"I, Claudius,\\" the battle scenes lacked pop and the characters were flat. Belisarius himself seemed one-dimensional. This could have been a product of the narration style Graves chose for this book (i.e., telling the story through the eyes of one of Antonina's slaves). It put him in a bit of a straight-jacket when it came to recounting scenes the slave in question could not possibly have seen.<br /><br />Also, Graves doesn't explore in any great detail what for many is the over-riding mystery of the life of Belisarius: why did he remain so perfectly loyal to Justinian over the course of his career while the emperor behaved toward him in ways that would hardly inspire loyalty in any other man?<br /><br />Finally, I picked up a certain animus for Christianity that I never noticed or didn't remember in Graves's other works--particularly in his unkind treatment of Pope Saint Silverius. This was perhaps the most disappointing aspect of all, from my perspective.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Count Belisarius\\" in one word--forgettable. This time period, and Belisarius in particular, are so intensely interesting, complex, and notable that they deserve much grander treatment than this. I'd recommend the more recent [[ASIN:1889758787 Belisarius: The First Shall Be Last]] by Belzoni as a better attempt at giving the great general his proper due.	2003-07-15

But if they choose to undertake the task I advise them to cast what they have to say in grand style.\\"<br />Thus ends Marcellinus's history of Rome. Although we have extant only the period from Constantius II to Valens (354 - 378 AD) it is enough to establish Marcellinus as one of the great ancient historians. It chronicles a troubled time near the end of the Roman Empire in the West and the advent of a new order in Europe. Beginning with the paranoid reign of Constantius II, the arian son of Constantine the Great, Marcellinus then focuses on Julian the Apostate and his meteoric rise to the purple. A throw-back to the time of the \\"virtuous pagans\\" like Marcus Aurelius, Julian attempts to reinvigorate the moribund corpse of classical paganism, moves steadily to put Christianity on the outs, and even attempts to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem. However, all his efforts come to naught in portentious ways, ending in his death while on a calamitous campaign in Persia.<br />The work climaxes at the destruction of a Roman field army and death of the Emperor Valens at Adrianople by the Goths in 378. This catastrophe ranks along with Salamis, Pharsalus, Manzikert, and Lepanto in terms of being a battle that effectively changed the course of history. After the defeat, Gothic tribes roamed practically at will throughout the Empire, even sacking Rome in 410 AD and laying claim to all of Italy less than 100 years later.<br />Though criticized by later historians, Marcellinus maintains a vivid style throughout the work that holds the reader's attention. This Penguin edition is abridged, giving greater weight to the reign of Julian than to Valentinian I or Valens. The translation manages to preserve well the \\"grand style\\" urged by Marcellinus. All in all, it is an excellent resource for the student of late classical history.alentinian I or Valens. The translation manages to preserve well the \\"grand style\\" urged by Marcellinus.

Instead, I read Procopius's historical works from the Loeb Classical Library, Vasiliev's two volume Byzantine Empire, and various other works. It was only recently that I picked up my copy of the Secret History and read it. I now understand why my professors in college assigned it--but not the actual histories of Procopius. It's short and full of titilating hearsay--perfect fodder for lazy college students. It also casts a terrible light on the Emperor Justinian, who is otherwise well remembered by history and the Empress Theodora is especially singled out for attack.<br />Modern scholars, for the most part, seem to accept the authenticity of the \\"Secret History.\\" I remain doubtful, based on the other works of Procopius I have read. In his other works, he appears to be a reasonably sober historian of the classical Greco-Roman stripe. In the \\"Secret History\\" however, he is little short of hysterical. He makes ridiculous claims--such as that Justinian was responsible for the deaths of over 1 trillion people or that the emperor was actually a demon in human form. As to this latter claim, he even goes so far as to relate an anecdote that supposedly Justinian's mother believed that he was conceived by a demon. Futhermore, he claims that several \\"unnamed sources\\" saw Justinian's head disappear or else become transformed into a shapeless lump of flesh.<br />If we accept that the \\"Secret History\\" is authentic, it makes Procopius perhaps the most schizophrenic author in all of history. In the vast majority of his works, at least one of which was written *after* the Secret History, he praises Justinian and his works. Why he would have written something so at odds with his previous and later histories is in itself a fascinating question. Clearly, he had some axe to grind. It's important to remember that Constantinople at that time was a highly partisan place. When we reflect on some of the partisan and often fictitious scandal sheets that are written about our own leaders today, it is not surprising that similar things existed then. One wonders whether Procopius was a green or a blue...<br />At any rate, I do not recommend reading the \\"Secret History\\" if you know little to nothing about the late Roman/early Byzantine period. You will come away with a highly skewed opinion of the time period. Now, if only Penguin would see fit to put the other works of Procopius in inexpensive paperbacks, a balanced understanding could be achieved. Until then, I recommend the Loeb editions, expensive though they are.tious scandal sheets that are written about our own leaders today, it is not surprising that similar things existed then.

It took his mother, prayer, and the grace of Almighty God to make him a saint--and indeed one of the greatest saints of the Catholic Church.<br />What is most striking about Augustine's story is how easily it relates to our own lives and our own times. It is impossible to read &quot;Confessions&quot; without seeing a little bit of yourself in his tales of his early life. The book is perfect for anyone struggling with their Christian faith. Indeed, it helped bring me back to the Catholic Church.<br />This translation is well-written and highly readable. I own it and highly recommend it.	2003-02-17

Over the course of his life, Fr. de Smet travelled nearly 300,000 miles. He braved shipwrecks, blizzards, drought, famine, sectarian strife, hostile tribes, horrible food, sickness and every imaginable hardship for the sake of the Gospel. Especially dear to his heart were the Indians of the Plains and Rocky Mountains--the Flatheads, Kalispels, Coeur d'Alenes, Pend d'Oreilles, Sioux, and many others. By the end of his life, he had baptized thousands of people, brought succor to the afflicted, food to the hungry, and on several occasions was instrumental in bringing peace between warring tribes and the United States.<br />The book itself is a true pioneer story and reveals a slice of life on the frontier (1823 through 1874) that is rarely seen. As such, it will be of great interest to any student of American history and those who wish to learn more about the great contributions made by those intrepid men of the Jesuit order.<br />Father de Smet represents everything the Society of Jesus used to be: strong, austere, manly, intelligent, compassionate, courageous, generous, and positively on fire to win souls for Christ. Many of his rather soft brethren of today could learn a lot from his excellent example.	2003-01-30
US	40936847	R3CKLDFCZS7C0K	0895554623	208260469	The Crisis Of Civilization	Books	3	25	30	N	N	A mixed bag, but definitely worth reading	Based on Belloc's lectures at Fordham University, New York, in 1937, \\"Crisis of Civilization\\" is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is an insightful interpretation of history from an unabashedly Catholic viewpoint. On the other hand, some of Belloc's temporal notions of how to best cope with the dangers posed by this crisis seem anachronistic 65 years later.<br />The most compelling sections of the book may be found in the 100 or so pages. These passages alone make the book very worthwhile reading as Belloc delves into the creation and heyday of Christendom. He then tackles the negative temporal effects that the fragmentation of unified of Christendom had on Europe and the world in the wake of the Reformation. As usual, Belloc pulls no punches when it comes to ascribing many of the evils of our society (at least in 1937) to the theology that emanated from Reformation thinkers. He quite rightly considers the rise of modern capitalism as a result of Protestant theology.<br />However, Belloc goes off the rails, when he buys into the marxist logic that capitalism naturally devolves into monopoly and eventually communism -- the true, real, and most dangerous enemy to Catholicism. While he is certainly correct that world communism (or \\"green environmentalism\\", or \\"anarchism\\", or \\"progressivism\\", or whatever pseudonyms it's operating under these days) was and is the most vicious foe of the Catholic Church, Belloc errs in thinking that communism inevitably grows from market capitalism. Of course, it's difficult to fault him on this as he was writing in the late-1930s during the Great Depression when capitalism seemed to have failed and communism and atheistic socialism of various brands seemed on an unstoppable trajectory toward world domination<br />Naturally, then, some of Belloc's remedies to the capitalism were perhaps alarmist. As a supporter of American free-market capitalism, I found Belloc's proposed system of social engineering through massive taxation odious to say the least. However, his idea that the teachings of the Catholic Church can form a bulwark against the spread of communism by softening the more cut-throat aspects of capitalist society are right on the mark. It's not surprising, then, that since Belloc's time, the Church has been targeted for infiltration, corruption, and destruction by the forces of world communism and their useful idiots. And recent history has shown us that those countries where Christianity is strongest hold out the best against the easy despotism offered by socialists.<br />In case it's not obvious to this point, \\"Crisis of Civilization\\" provides an enormous amount of food for thought and is thus well worth reading, even if only to spur debate about where Belloc went wrong in the light of historical hindsight: the fall of Soviet and Eastern European communism; the present crumbling of European and Canadian socialism (yes, it's inevitable -- just look at the Canadian national health system); and the incredible dynamism and resilience of the American economy which has resisted many of the socialist incursions that European nations have foolishly embraced and which, contrary to Belloc's thesis, is still primarily driven by the engine of the small businessman.the least.

Within five minutes of reading it, I was hooked. The next 1,000 pages simply flew by and I literally could not put the book down. For someone who's never read it before, it's an enthralling tale of treachery, despair, hope, and ultimately a quest for vengeance. After finishing &quot;The Count&quot;, I immediately sought out every book by Dumas I could get my hands on (The Three Musketeers, Ten Years After, and The Man in the Iron Mask). They were all exceptional reads, but none of them matched the brilliance of &quot;The Count .&quot;<br />Any reader who enjoys tales of adventure and has a taste for historical novels will love this book. I thought the recent movie version was excellent too, but I highly recommend reading the book first.	2002-10-15

Thanks to my deficient education in modern Jesuit schools, I picked this book knowing only the 'traditional' interpretations of the Protestant Reformation and its principle characters such as Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Cardinal Richelieu, Oliver Cromwell, etc. Offering brief biographies of 23 men and women central to the Protestant Reformation, Belloc attempts to demonstrate that the Reformation, at least in Britain, was driven more by political and economic forces than by a genuine pious desire to reform the Catholic Church. The central theme established throughout the brief bios is that the Reformation would never have succeeded in dividing Christendom permanently without the victory it achieved in England. And, that this victory in England would never have been achieved if not for the avarice of those Britons whose fortunes were derived directly from the looting of Church property.<br />I found Belloc's thesis to be well-buttressed and compelling. I would recommend this book to those who, like myself, have only ever heard the traditional (ie. Protestant) interpretation of the Reformation. It would also be useful to someone with little knowledge of the subject looking for a readable and interesting starting point.	2002-07-15

For the past 15 years or so I've been told that we have a 'vocations crisis' within the Church -- that young men are no longer interested in becoming priests. A litany of reasons is given for this: young men are too materialistic today, celibacy is too difficult for us 'enlightened' moderns, young men don't agree with the Church's positions on moral issues, the Church hasn't done enough marketing, and (most disingenuous of all) leftover orthodoxy from the pre-Vatican II period is driving young men away.<br />Those 'liberals' within the Church offer up a predictable laundry list of \\"solutions\\" for this 'vocations crisis': Married priests, priestesses, \\"lay ministers\\", etc. Until very recently, these ideas almost looked reasonable. Not anymore.<br />This book positively blows the lid off of all the false reasons for the 'vocations crisis' and uncovers the shocking truth and hidden agendas behind what's going on in Catholic seminaries across the U.S. I used to think that a good Catholic fellow who believed and followed what the Church taught about such issues as abortion, contraception, homosexuality, the primacy of the Pope, transubstantiation, the immaculate conception, etc. would be a shoe-in for the priesthood. What this book demonstrates is that such devout young men are being routinely TURNED AWAY from the seminaries for no other reason than that they hold and believe these eminently orthodox positions! Who are being accepted in their places? I think the current and growing scandal within the Catholic Church in America provides a clear-cut answer. Now, institutionally, the Catholic Church in America is suffering an evisceration that Antonio Gramsci would be proud of.<br />In short, if you are a Catholic and you honestly care about what's been happening within our Church and why, you simply can not ignore this book. It will be very difficult reading for many of you, but if we are to weed out the wolves-in-sheep's-clothing among our leaders, we must begin with an honest appraisal of the situation. This book offers just such an appraisal and I wholeheartedly recommend it.othing among our leaders, we must begin with an honest appraisal of the situation.

Belloc dismisses the succession of further crusading efforts as failed attempts to regain what was lost at Hattin in 1187 AD. His analysis of why the original Crusade succeeded in setting up a Christian kingdom in Palestine for nearly 100 years is spot on. His opinion on why the kingdom eventually failed is fairly perceptive as well. He hammers the point that if the Crusaders had only succeeded in capturing Damascus, the effort may not have crumbled at all. The main weakness in Belloc's thesis is his acceptance of social Darwinist theories that today seem rather antiquated.<br /><br />Yet this does not take away from the perceptive and often prophetic observations he makes on the relationship between the Christian West and the Muslim East. To whet your appetite, here's a quote that's amazingly relevant, considering the recent atrocities:<br /><br />\\"There is with us [in the West] a complete chaos in religious doctrine.... We worship ourselves, we worship the nation; or we worship (some few of us) a particular economic arrangement believed to be the satisfaction of social justice....Islam has not suffered this spiritual decline; and in the contrast between [our religious chaos and] the religious certitudes still strong throughout the Mohammedan world ... lies our peril.\\"<br /><br />The book is an excellent place to start for anyone looking to brush up on their history of this often misunderstood era. If you love this sort of stuff, might I suggest that you also give [[ASIN:1889758566 Angels in Iron]] by Nicholas Prata a shot. It's a historical fiction account of the other end of the crusading era - the Great Siege of Malta of 1565.	2002-03-29

You wonder, &quot;Is this permitted?&quot; If you had read James Akin's book, you would know that the answer is yes. However, when this same priest substitutes the Apostles Creed for the Nicene Creed at an adult mass, you'll also know that he's stepped over the line.<br />Always respectful to the priestly office, James Akin has written a terrific resource for Catholics who worry that their priest might be taking liturgical innovation too far. He also gives detailed instructions on how to approach a priest who has transgressed liturgical law, and what to do if you can't get a response. In these days of clown and balloon masses, paganesque liturgical dancing, and 'guest speakers' at the homily, this book will offer valuable guidance for the confused layman.	2002-03-29

Considering the popularity of the recent movie 'Gladiator', this book is certainly a worthwhile read, if only to remind the reader of the innumerable horrors that took place in that arena. The gladiatorial contests were not the only gory spectacles that took place there. Often forgotten now-a-days are the true stories of Christians fed to the lions - quite literally - and the occasional miraculous occurances that accompanied these torments. Some of the martyrdoms chronicled in this book are clearly hyperbolic, others are suspiciously repititious, and the author's flowery, 19th century prose doesn't help convince the modern reader of the truth of certain accounts. However, several of the accounts are compelling, and the author's chronological listing of the martyrdoms and the emperors involved gives the reader a nice counterpoint to secular Roman history. Overall, an interesting and fulfilling read.	2002-02-18

Need some background on Maximian of Ravenna or a quick history of the martyrdom of Perpetua and Felicitas? This volume is an excellent reference. Having used it as a resource for apologetical endeavors, I have found it supremely useful when confronted with historical personages or Christian teachings that were unfamiliar. Bibliographies at the end of each entry allow easy access to further research. I found two drawbacks: The first is regarding the large number of contributors - this ensures that the quality of the entries is somewhat uneven throughout. The second is the occasional 'political correctness' which creeps in to some entries - but I suppose that's unavoidable in a book published by a secular press. All in all, though, a very good reference.	2002-02-18

The author manages to paint a fairly vanilla portrait of Augustus and in my opinion does not present a compelling rationale for *why* he did some of the things he did. That being said, reading this book is not wasted time. It presents the who, what, when, where, and how of Augustus' life very clearly and concisely. And as always, the quality of the production of this Routledge book is extremely high.	2002-01-25

I appreciated the large tracts given to both Abigail and John Quincy who were, of course, integral parts of Adam's life. The chapters which covered Adam's tenure abroad in France and the Netherlands were engaging and highly interesting. However, I was disappointed in the several aspects of the book:<br />#1: Lack of in-depth investigation into the moral and spiritual life of Adams. While Adam's religious convictions are touched upon a few times, I was unsatisfied upon reaching the end and felt that this fascinating aspect of Adam's character was not examined in enough detail.<br />#2: The author spent what seemed like too many pages on Thomas Jefferson. While it is undeniable that the lives of Adams and Jefferson were inextricably intertwined, I felt that some of the longer Jefferson passages - particularly as related to Sally Hemmings and Jefferson's alleged sexual misconduct, onto which no new light is shed - could have been safely edited out without damaging the integrity of the work. Indeed, having read a few Jefferson biographies, I did not notice a corresponding preoccupation with Adams in those.<br />#3: I was almost impressed that the author didn't insinuate extra-marital affairs based on scant evidence - almost because he does just this at the tail end of the book based on a single remark made by an elderly Adams to a long-term female acquaintance. I found this comment out of place. To the author's credit, he at least didn't try to extrapolate dozens of affairs based on this one remark.<br />This said, I believe this book is definitely worth a careful reading and though incomplete, is full of solid scholarly insight.	2001-12-27
