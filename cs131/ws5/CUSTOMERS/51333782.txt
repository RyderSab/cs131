When she becomes pregnant he is forced to marry her. He can't admit how deeply he cares for her so when she loses their child he rekindles an old affair with his ex-mistress. He soon comes to his senses and realizes that he truly loves his &quot;Caitie&quot; but it is too late. She has discovered him with his mistress and leaves him. She joins her father in Africa where he is searching for a lost necklace. Rand quickly realizes just what his inability to admit his feelings has cost him and journey's to Africa to try and convince Cait to give him another chance. But he realizes that it's not as easy as that....love isn't the problem..trust is. Can he ever get Cait to trust him enough to restart their marriage? I have always loved Kat Martin's historical romances but her last two(including this one) have left a little to be desired. Although I like Rand and Cait and the story sucks you in, I had a problem with the infidelity storyline. I like a story that makes you feel good but the affair left me feeling disappointed. I also felt like Ms. Martin wrapped up the book to easy. I was left feeling as if things ended too quickly and easily. I am hoping her next book will be more like her older romances such as Gypsy Lord(great one!)	2000-10-06

Ok, Nicholas marries Eleanor because his brother ruined her and she may be carrying his child. Then he supposedly falls in love with her but keeps a mistress(he's only sleeping with her for the sake of his country...he  doesn't enjoy it...what a load of garbage)and avoids Eleanor so that he  won't hurt her by going from his mistress's bed to hers. Personally, I  routed for Eleanor to run away with Lord Middleton. I mean I felt  absolutely no sympathy for Nicholas..in fact I grew to seriously dislike  him. I'm sure that England could have found some other way to get the  information Nicholas was looking for without his mistress. In the end  Eleanor just forgave him and took him back because of course he did it for  his country and didn't mean to hurt Eleanor. If you are looking for a story  that leaves you feeling like things worked out the way they should and the  characters deserve to live happily ever after this is not the book for  you!	2000-06-19

I found this book to be a total waste of time and it actually made me angry. The midwife Tara had been gang raped not once but twice in her past but joked about it and laughed. I have never met a woman who had been raped  once that thought it was funny enough to laugh about at anytime, regardless  of coming to terms with what had happened to them, let alone having been  gang raped twice. She then went to say that Tara was unable to have  children due to a veneral disease contracted due to the rapes which she was  unaware that she had and so had gone untreated causing damage. Get  real..this woman is supposed to be a midwife and she didn't know that she  should have gotten checked out? Ms. Early does no help to the cause of  midwives here. I will avoid any books by this author in the future if this  is an example of her books!	2000-05-05
