US	37293132	R2A78JFBQF2WU8	0786888334	816908821	The Bone Parade	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Meh	This book falls flatly in the \\"nothing special\\" category, though I'll round up to 3 stars. <br /> <br />First off, there's some distinct sexual perversion here.  Early on a character mentions the actions of finding an explicit sexual site online, one that goes outside the bounds of the viewers morals, but hooks him right away.  The author seems to have spent significant time on these sites, as the book delves, or at least mentions, subjects such as incest, pedophilia, bestiality, and drunken college lesbianism.  In fact, there seems to be an infatuation with dogs and their genitalia at one point.  However, none of this really pushes very far or gets explored much, which is a good thing.  It's noticed in this book, yet it is not a distraction. <br /> <br />Perhaps that is a frightening sign of the impact of the internet. <br /> <br />As far as plot, you've got a serial killer that hides his work as art.  Pretty cool, but I wondered if anyone ever noticed fingerprints in his art.  You've got two romances, one twisted and interesting, one standard yet not unbelievable.  You've got pain, suffering and dementia.  Standard for the type of book. <br /> <br />Nothing terribly new is brought to the table, outside of a solid look into the mind of the killer.  I found myself reading his first person narratives tightly, then putting the book down when the focus switched to the other main character.  I'd come back, slug through her somewhat tired and mundane chapter, and get back to the killer detailing his day.  Hard to fault the author, as focusing exclusively on the killer would have grown tiresome, but the second lead was the same character you've read a hundred times. <br /> <br />This is the downfall of the book, even if it is unavoidable.  In fact, I found myself skipping later chapters altogether.  I suppose it was the climax, a \\"thrilling chase,\\" yet I knew the predictable fate of the characters and found myself not caring about the details of the chase.  I didn't needto run about near falls off of cliffs, as I knew who would grab ahold at the last second and pull to safety.  I wanted interaction between the characters, not supposedly tense but predictable escapes.  I believe I skimmed 50 of the last 70 pages in a span of minutes, just quickly looking for keywords that may signify a twist. <br /> <br />Again, this likely reflects more upon the genre than the author, and is due to me reading hundreds of beach books such as this.   <br /> <br />As it stands the book is decent.  It isn't terribly original, but original and twisted enough.  I sat by the water and plowed through it in less than a day.  I suggest you do the same.	2005-06-19

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to find that his father was carefully overseeing the process and helping Dirk with it. <br /> <br />While Cussler the elder was never a literary genius, in either content or style, he was always an excellent storyteller.  He flowed well, which is the point of a novel such as this.  One should expect a brainier blockbuster movie script, and that's what one gets. <br /> <br />The book has its flaws.  The characters are the biggest problem.  I'm sold on young Dirk, after being worried in the last novel.  He's pretty much exactly his father, only younger.  Same looks, same wisecracks, same backtalking.  He works, particularly due to the backtalking.   <br />Dirk Jr. is given his own Al Giordino, but this character gets very little time in the book, and seems out of place. <br />His true sidekick is his sister.  This creates problems, to me at least.  Great care is given to the sexiness and sultriness of the sister.  Wonderful.  Would be great if her brother wasn't two feet away at all times.  The prior book felt a bit incestuous at times, and this one isn't as close but still... going into great detail of how sexy a girl is when the only nearby male is her brother seems a bit... odd.  I'd like to see Summer get a backplace and the Al standin take the true sidekick role. <br /> <br />The bigger problem is Dirk Sr.  First off, he's now head of NUMA (Rudi Gunn must be fuming), yet still does quite a bit of dangerous fieldwork.  Seems a bit too much for the head of a major government agency.  I could look past this, however, if you could tell the Pitt's apart.  Too often you're reading about what Dirk/Pitt/Dirk Pitt is doing, clueless as to which Pitt it is, the younger or the elder.  It gets particularly annoying when the two are in the same scene.  Part if this may be simply that I read these books very, very quickly, but isn't that the point? <br /><br />The plot works fine.  Standard Cussler, only perhaps a bit more political for the main line.  Evil billionaire, blah blah blah, hypocritical, unaware of the fool he is, Pitt saves the world.  You've read it a few dozen times by now.  If you liked it then, you'll like it now.  Still no better action/adventure writer out there, even now that the Cussler has changed. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line - if you like to turn your brain off in the summer months but don't want to be insulted, go for the Pitt series, including this one.  No thinking involved, no mystery, just action and adventure with a quick flow.  Most authors of this genre either get mired down or insult intelligence, Cussler does neither.	2005-05-19

They are working on their solo careers as well as their paired career, kicking out books very, very regularly.  And thus far all those books have been subpar. <br /> <br /> <br />Brimstone is the worst of the lot.  This book, quite frankly, is dull.  The paperback clocks in over 700 pages, yet most of them are terribly uninteresting.  They're trying to build a world around Pendergast, which seemed like a good idea at first but now you'll find yourself struggling to remember small details from the last book, as well as finding D'Agosta a more interesting character.  The more we've learned about Pendergast, the less we seem to care. <br /> <br />Making matters worse is the sheer predictability of the plot.  While you won't know the motive until the last two thirds of the book (it isn't introduced for quite some time), you'll know who is doing the killings by page 180.  Out of 700.  Making matters worse, the ultra-clever protagonist seems incapable of figuring it out.  This is just frustrating, and a large part of the dullness of the book.  It's quite clear that only one person was capable of the murder, so you're left with nearly 600 pages just to figure out why.   <br /> <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of the duo, or was.  Cabinet of Curiosities was their last high quality book.  Their solo books have been a mixed bag, some being quite readable some being agonizingly uninspired, but this is their current nadir. <br /> <br /> <br />Avoid it.  Don't let these two authors simply cash in on their names by shoveling a rushing rapid of garbage upon us.  Only give them your money when they deserve it, and since they've returned to solo form they've certainly stopped deserving it.	2005-05-16

He's a beach reader.  Not even the best of his genre, one consisting exclusively of beach reads.  Still, he's consistently entertaining, and doesn't go too far off the deep end all that often. <br /> <br />This book is a bit more dull than the rest of his works, but it's also the best based in science.  Some of his other novels take unbelievable leaps towards the end, this seems a bit more believable.  So, while it's not exactly action-packed, it doesn't insult you too much. <br /> <br />The characters have some depth, moreso than usual, though it's shallow depth.  There are plenty of inroads to their personalities, though they're not terribly explored.  Perhaps this hurts the book, as the action isn't amazing and the characters don't make up for it.  Still, it shows growth for Rollins, and I imagine he's ramping up nicely for new books. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line - not his finest, but shows some nice transitions.  The book won't captivate you, and is sometimes easy to put down, but it won't bore you, either.  Have a train or airplane you need to sit on for several hours?  This book will do you no wrong.	2005-05-16

The first was good, but not excellent.  This is more of the same.    For the record this book is not written by Cussler.  Some seem confused about this.  It merely takes characters he created and thrusts them further into his world.    The result is a mixed bag.  The author, Craig Dirgo, seems to have some interesting ideas, and some interesting spins on the typical \\"bad guys.\\"  He deserves credit for that.    However, he tends to fall into some terrible cliches.  Several chapters end along the lines of \\"he had no way of knowing that donut would be his last.\\"  Once in a novel is bad enough, this seemed to have it once every 100 pages.    The book also suffers a bit from a deluge of characters.  The first book seemed more so, as characters of the main company came and went.  Dirgo seemed to recognize this and has cut back a lot, now having the main character do the bulk of the work.  Unrealistic perhaps, but easier.  Personally I'd rather he uses some of the grunts more, but stick with a small handful per book.    Also, there are a few times in the beginning where government officials just seem to accept things that sound impossible without any argument.  In fact, there's at least one conversation where a simple sentence completely and unnaturally reverses an opinion.    The book moves quickly and will keep you interested.  It won't capture you like Clive's books, but it will fill a void.  Perfect for an afternoon on the beach or snowed in.  It never insults the reader (which is the key, as this makes Matthew Reilly's novels unreadable,) and never really bores.  It just never rises to where it could.	2005-03-01

You'll know the ending before you get there with nearly every twist, but they actually hold their cards close to their chest.  Sure you figure out the twists before they happen, but only when they let you.  For the majority of this book you'e in the dark. <br /> <br />And yes, the characters aren't entirely deep.  They're likable, though, and deep enough to fit the book.  You'll even enjoy a runty little \\"jocks suck\\" Hot Topic girl, which is very hard to do. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall the book pleases.  If you've enjoyed the duo's books in the past you're sure to enjoy this one.  Perhaps not as much as Cabinet, but you'll still fly through the book.  If you've never read the duo before then start with Relic and go through them in order. <br /> <br />Still, this is a must for science-oriented mystery fans that like their books entertainingly breezy instead of deep.  It's Hollywood style, for certain - a beach book, but an excellent one at that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The largest complaint, however, is that the mallgoth gets to read the sequel to Ice Limit and we don't.  If I ever pass either Preston or Child on the street I'll be sure to huck this book at them for teasing us so much, haha.	2004-08-16
US	37293132	RGSCDQQ2UOTCI	0425188817	69021739	Sleeper	Books	1	0	6	N	N	Pretty atrocious	This is what happens when authors have little imagination.<br />Boring concept, no original ideas, and twists that are either completely predictable or completely moronic.  <br />Clever is not the way to describe this book.  Painful might be, though.<br />The location is amazing.  The characters aren't terrible.  But the decisions made with the monster most certainly are.  Everything plays like the authors were looking at this as an assignment, job and chore instead of labor of love.  Little effort seems to be put into the wording and wordplay, and the book gets ridiculous and, quite frankly, stupid towards the end.<br />Stupid is actually an understatement.  When you read the book you'll see why.  The ending is just... ridiculously, incomprehensibly absurd.  It's mind-boggling and painful.<br />The book begins questionably but interestingly.  You need to throw what you know about the world out the window in order to embrace his, but even then you're left shocked that someone thought these were good ideas.<br />Good concept, absolutely awful execution.	2004-07-05
US	37293132	R1I0KJMMZA9AZF	0886778530	130025448	Blood Moon	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Needed an editor	The author has an interesting idea here.<br />More imporantly, the author has great knowledge about the space program.  If not, well, he manages to fake it extremely well.<br />What the book is missing, though, is editing.  The writing is dull and drab.  There's no flair, no creativity, just the facts laid out in front of you.  Even worse, there are some very, very rough transitions, where there will be a thought then an entrance into a characters backstory in the same paragraph without a clear connection.  Though they're tied in towards the end of the paragraph, the simple transition is so rough it pulls you from the story.<br />I must applaud the author for details and for not copping out on the ending, giving it actual thought.  It ends quickly, though, and many loose ends never get tied tightly.<br />Perhaps the strangest part of this book, though, is that amidst pure horror, all the females in charge find themselves drawn towards subordinate men, compromising their authority.  They're weak to prevent this, as well.  Strange and unnecessary.<br />A solid first draft, but it should have been worked and reworked a few times to get a tighter book.	2004-07-05

A psychologist is brought in to research a double suicide.  The couple was seemingly perfect: wealthy, intelligent, incredibly happy together, and with a newborn baby.  Why had this couple self-destructed?<br />The company bringing him in is Eden, Inc, a matchmaking service.  Founded by reclusive Richard Silver, the company is famous for matching couples that are nearly perfect for each other, with wild success.  This couple was a so-called &quot;supercouple,&quot; one that was indeed a perfect match.<br />It begins strong and fluid, and is quite enjoyable.  It feels different, as the company isn't dark, sinister and shadowy.  They have some aspects of your standard dark, sinister and shadowy companies, but none of the characteristics.  In fact it's refreshingly honest and benevolent.<br />So what changes?  Well, the company is based on an incredible computer.  This computer, named Liza, is a learning machine capable of passing the Turing Test.  That is, the AI can pass for human.  It learns, evolves, and adapts.  It even teaches itself.  <br />Gee, have you heard this one before?<br />*Spoilers*<BR>Ok, so you have a smart machine.  You read this and your first thought was &quot;did it have something to do with the suicides?  Was it acting on its own without people realizing?&quot;  Then you think, &quot;No, can't be.  This book is refreshingly different.  Lincoln Child has done this before, he won't be that lazy.  Utopia wasn't a lazy book, aside from Wingnut.  The books with Preston aren't lazy books.  No way will he be lazy.&quot;<br />Sorry, folks, he's lazy, uninspired, and retells a story you've read a few thousand times before.<br />/end spoilers.<br />I give the book three stars because it begins so well.  Somewhere between pages 200 and 260 you'll have the entire ending figured out, though.  Every tiny twist, every little detail - you'll know it all.  With an extra100 pages left (the book is a bit thin), well, I'm sorry to say you won't care.  You already know the ending, so you won't want to read it all that carefully.<br />Even worse, many of the final pages get bogged down with technical aspects you don't care much about, either.  I've done extensive programming in Assembly and even found myself skimming over his discussions on machine language and registers.  I feel bad for the non-technically inclined, they'll be utterly lost just as the conclusion is playing out.<br />Not that it matters, I'm sure they figured the ending out long before and are just reading to get it over with, hoping they are somehow surprised.<br />A worthy first 200 pages, a sad final 250 pages.  Two and a half star book, at best.  I rounded up out of respect for the author, I suppose, but even then I feel this should only be getting one star for being so stale, predictable, and ten or fifteen years too late.	2004-07-03
US	37293132	R2Y4FFXN444DPN	0765307006	554998165	The Codex	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Enjoyable	It will be impossible to review this book without a comparison to Lincoln Child's Utopia, so I'll do it first.<br />This book is smoother than Utopia.<br />The flow is quicker, the rhythm is more solid, and the book has much more of a brisk pace.  Much of this comes from more dialogue and shorter paragraphs.  <br />Is smooth necessarily good?  In this case yes.  The book is an adventure book, through-and-through, and plays well with the speed.  The characters are stereotypes, but they're supposed to be.<br />The setup of the book, as you can already tell, is a tad contrived.  Aren't they always?  The rest of the book works, though, with little groaning or reason to complain.  The largest groan, perhaps, could be sex between two people that have spent over a month in the wet, rain-soaked jungle without a proper shower or hygeine concerns.  Oral sex, in fact.  Improbable, unlikely, completely unbelievable.<br />Overall, though, you can feel the lack of Child, especially after reading Utopia (which, in retrospect, has a lack of Preston).  Child seems to be best at bringing slower points of the book - plot developments and information.  Preston seems best at bringing the action and dialogue.  Neither concentrates much on character development, even though the characters do evolve more here than other adventures they evolve very predictably (yet satisfyingly.)<br />A solid read, great for the beach or a weekend trip.  Recommended.<br />On a side note: in the battle of the gimmicky, transparent sidekicks Preston takes the lead.  Hairy Bugger isn't nearly as throwaway or one-dimensional plotwise as Wingnut was.  Wingnut was a huge groan, Hairy Bugger just a mild one.	2004-07-01

US	37293132	RF5G46BPVNZ84	0060002492	534292075	Amazonia	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Entertaining	Suspend belief on this one.  It's absolutely necessary to enjoy it.<br />It isn't hard to do, though.  The author has some fun with the more unbelievable aspects, winking almost, and the action is kept realistic, merely the circumstances are unbelievable.  That's the key to holding the book together.<br />The characters aren't anything overly memorable, but you'll remember highly trained military squads against over-sized 'gators (well, almost) for quite some time.  <br />The twists can often be seen, right down to an animal pal that is there to be sacrificed.  Why must all books of this type include some sort of animal/robot sidekick there exclusively for the purpose of saving everyone's skin in the last act?  Don't authors know WE SEE THIS COMING A MILE AWAY?  Shame on them for committing to such an amateur device.  <br />The ending, though a bit of a letdown after the action, works.  You've already suspended disbelief for the appearance of the events, so suspsending it further for the cause isn't too hard.  It's still a letdown, but not nearly as much as these stories often have.<br />If you're a fan of the loose science-fiction action/horror genre you'll be a fan of this.  Think Preston/Child, Jeff Long, Matt Reilly, and Clive Cussler, falling somewhere in the middle of that grouping.	2004-06-27

You already know everything there is to know about this book as you've read it before.  You know what the characters are going to do and what they'll say.  You'll know who will die within the first 50 pages.<br />Expect to groan a great deal.  Expect to groan more often than you flip pages as the story goes on.  Expect to know the outcome of the action very quickly.  Expect to know the full backstory before you read it.  Don't expect outstanding writing skills, as writing takes an absolute backseat to simple action narrative.<br />Least of all, don't expect any maturity over time in the characters, don't expect any intelligence in them, and don't expect to relate to more than their hobbies.  As a matter of fact, you might not even be able to tell one from another based on personality, as they say the same things.  The only real difference is the backstory.<br />Do yourself a favor, track down a copy of Michael Talbot's The Bog, from the 80s.  The story is almost exactly the same, only the care given to the changes in the characters sets it far above this novel.	2004-06-24

There are very, very few books I'd give that adjective to, and many belong to Mr. King himself.  <br />The plot is essentially the same as The House on Haunted Hill.  A group of strangers are asked to spend a specific amount of time within a supposedly haunted building, only to learn that they have some connection webbing between them all.<br />It's not the most original plot in the world, but even Shakespeare was known to recycle from those before him.<br />Ok, I've already referenced King and Shakespeare here.  This book is not in a league with them (nor are they in a league with each other).  It's a solid effort, though.  There are some groaning points, and moments when you just keep asking why the character is being so stupid, but it's made clear that many of these characters are not of sound mind and not of the best judgment.<br />What really makes this book, though, are the following:<BR>Setting.  Run-down projects with a long history of violence.<br />Characters.  They're diverse with clearly different personalities.<BR>Writing.  This book is dense.  The paragraphs are long and thick but not cluttered.  You're getting a great deal of words for your dollar, as no page is wasted.  The result is a clear understanding of the characters and some great, flowing narrative and descriptions.<br />I suppose the last point could be a sore one for many.  My girlfriend started this novel and found it bulky, never finishing it.  To me, though, it just made the book richer and livelier.  Horror books tend to vary between pages of redundant, gory action narrative and pages of simple, one-sentence dialogue.  This book tries to read more like a novel and less like a movie script, and it pays off.<br />Be aware of some flaws in this book, but it will still shine as you read it.  Give it a chance if you want a horror book with moderately more meat than the rest of the market.	2004-06-24
US	37293132	R2754EZKMNYMOT	0345455207	290935571	Utopia	Books	3	17	17	N	N	Worth reading but not remembering	Hard to rate this book, honestly, especially without half stars.<br />I disagree greatly with several of the reviews here.  For one, comparing it to Die Hard is a completely unfair way to sell this to a potential buyer.  Die Hard was a game of cat and mouse, full of action.  There isn't much action in this book, nor any hiding.  In fact, there's only one true gunfight, and it lasts 3 bullets.  More bullets are fired in other areas of the book, but it's against unarmed, unknowing people.<br />It's also unfair to compare this book to Jurassic Park.  Jurassic Park was a book about technology and action within a theme park of sorts.  This is a book involving some technology and action within a true theme park, but it's a different breed.  The action is limited, and the technology isn't explained or even described much, just presented as something that exists.<br />There are also some groaners.  Most notably is the Wingnut character mentioned in other reviews.  From his first appearance you know here's there simply to be sacrificed.  No surprises there, but to the authors credit he downplays the convenient behavior trait that leads to his usefulness, and incorporates it more as part of a whole rather than a way to exploit.  You may see Wingnut's usefulness coming, but Child doesn't get lazy and leave it at that.<br />Another issue is the terrorists themselves.  At one point it's mentioned that people would be shocked if they knew the true face of the ringleader, yet nothing comes from it after he's stopped.  A shame, but only due to that line.<br />So I've told you what this book isn't really, and that it has problems.  Is it worth reading?  Yes.  The book is essentially a crisis book within a theme park, a difficult concept to make realistic.  Child takes great effort to make it so, giving reasons why obvious answers must be ignored, and taking into account how a corporation would likely act.  Nothing is too unrealistic, and none of the plot will make you groan very hard at all.  This is arguably Child's greatest accomplishment within the book.<br />It's interesting, the characters have some depth to them, and you'll keep reading.  The full potential is never realized, but there are no falls off the edge, so you'll read with a smile.<br />A solid effort.  Not amazing, but solid enough that I look forward to Child's next solo effot.	2004-06-24

Sure, it deals with the Roman Catholic Church, but it's quite different.  In fact, while the Da Vinci Code comes across somewhat anti-Catholicism, this takes very opposite stance.  <br />This is also a novel, where the Da Vinci Code was a lecture.  The back history is explained much faster, and you're treated to a great deal more plot, with smarter twists.<br />There are huge flaws, as mentioned in other reviews.  The time-table is sketchy, the history is altered for reasons unknown, facts are confused, and the ending seems to have a few too many twists and a fall a bit too great.  <br />That aside, it's entertaining.  Not amazing, but entertaining.  Just keep in mind that you're checking your brain in the coatroom when you read this book, not bringing it along to learn.  If you desire to learn you'll end up getting a great deal of Trivial Pursuit questions wrong after this book.	2004-06-24
US	37293132	R11Y98DT1S5JIM	055380250X	303170656	The Taking	Books	2	6	14	N	N	Different for Koontz, and better	I find it interesting that the opening review here smites King for Koontz.  The two couldn't be more different, true, but King of late fills his books with compelling characters and a certain humanity the horror genre often lacks.<br />Koontz also takes a different approach than most horror, ignoring the endless repetition of gory descriptions, but his characters never feel fully fleshed out.  They never quite seem human, and always read like characters in a book.  For this Koontz is rarely amongst my reads, despite friends in the publishing business that seem to give me every release gratis.<br />The preachiness in this book mentioned by others is clear.  It's there, and it will grate on you.  For once, though, the characters seem to have some life in them outside of simple words on a page.<br />Koontz seems to be trying something new, and rising as more than a mere RL Stine for adults.  This story is more novel and less cookie-cutter, but still has ways to go.	2004-06-24
US	37293132	R3KZEHS1HO5Z7T	068805952X	298191424	The Bog	Books	4	22	23	N	N	Solid	They don't write horror like this anymore.<br />Don't get me wrong, the plot is fairly ho-hum.  Very been-there, done-that.<br />This book takes care with it's characters, though.  Horror these days tends to focus entirely on the actions and gory descriptions.  Here you get more of a focus on character depth.  Not to say it compares to a story based solely on the depth of characters, but it's just nice to see writing basics taking control instead of mere flash and glitz.<br />As a matter of fact the subtle changes of the characters during the first half had me enthralled, if only because it was so unexpected.  Unfortunately the latter half becomes much more routine, especially as loose ends begin to be tied up.  So it goes with nearly every horror story, though.<br />A worthy read.  I read it all in one sitting, something fairly uncommon for me, usually I try to spread a book into two days, but I finished this in a relaxing evening.<br />I somehow doubt this review will be read, or get much traffic.  A shame, the book is lost amongst lesser books with larger pressings and more expensive cover art.	2004-06-24
US	37293132	R1YHYWVKLYPNUP	0425195457	196052103	White Death (The NUMA Files)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Entertaining gap between Dirk novels	Yes, that is Clive Cussler's name in enormous letters, but one needs to merely read one page to know he isn't the author of this book (of course, we all know that already).<br />Paul Kemprecos is an adept author, but lacks the flair and word flow Cussler has.  As a result his book feels a bit stiffer, yet is still worth reading to someone familiar with Cussler's work.<br />All the pieces of the Cussler world are there.  Links to past worlds, history coming alive in modern times, events happening a small amount in the future to allow for more powerful technology, death-defying stunts that are over the top yet not nauseously so, a smart-alec sidekick - you'll find it all.  To some people this is all too much of a formula to enjoy, but if you're sitting on a beach, boat or inflatable raft, well, this is the perfect way to read without thinking.  <br />If you enjoyed James Bond or, more accurately Indiana Jones then you'll enjoy this novel.  It isn't the best in the Cussler world, though it's likely the best Kurt Austin book to date.  <br />Worth reading, just take it all with a grain of salt.  Or a salt-lick, whichever you need.	2004-06-24
US	37293132	R371WG6S6N9TQJ	0345446550	313039462	The Hole	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Decent	A decent start for a young author that could grow quite well if he refines himself a bit.<br />The story is convincing, for the most part, and it's entertaining to watch the characters interact.  You could read more into it, but nothing really warrants much more of an analysis than The Breakfast Club, a moderately similar story.<br />Still entertaining, though.  The bulk of the book is simply interaction between the characters as they're trapped, and this interaction has some neat surprises, though the characters themselves don't seem to offer as much distinction as they should.<br />Still, a budding author that could be one to watch.  Interestingly the movie gained notoriety for a budding starlet revealing more than many expect.  Stole some of the thunder from the plot I'm sure...	2004-06-24
US	37293132	R1H5NL7S90X2CM	1880418592	782981224	Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower, Book 6)	Books	4	47	58	N	N	The worst of the series	Though that doesn't say much, this series has been quite incredible thus far.<br />There are spoilers to the series within this review, so read ahead only if you've read the previous books.<br />As the title indicates, the bulk of the plot within this novel revolves around Susannah, along with Mia and her chap.  That isn't to say they get the most written about them, but nearly everything that happens is regarding the two.  <br />It is quite a change from The Wolves, however.  The Wolves covered a great deal of time and material, here the events take place within the same day.  You also get little party interaction, as the characters are all paired off.  <br />In the end you get the feeling not much has happened, not even the addition of more back story.  <br />The western themes disappear as the characters are brought into the world of the reader.  Stephen King himself appears, in a twist I'm still uncertain of.  The book has a drastically different feel for this, though, as it no longer feels like a world you're traveling to.  Even when Eddie was pulled from NYC and Roland himself wandered into it you got the feeling of an epic Western, here it all seems more... normal, I suppose.  Then again, King either kills himself off or mocks the news carried when he was struck by the van, so possibly it isn't exactly our world, though it's greatly hinted at as being so.<br />Do not start the series here, it would be an awful place to begin.  If you're in the series, however, you have no choice.  Read, and read away.  Just don't expect it to have nearly the depth, satisfaction, and epic feel of The Wolves or Wizard &amp; The Glass.  <br />Unsatisfying, is what I suppose I'm getting at.  It's unfair to call it that, however, as King is clearly at the top of his game with character control, descriptions and allusions.  It's just that, plot-wise, not much happens, and it's painful to realize how little has occured and that there's a mere novel left after this.<br />Good luck toMr. King in tying the ends as he finishes the series.  It's a shame he's truncated it down to 7, as opposed to the 12-16 he once predicted.  This is a story that he and his wife may feel has ended, but readers surely clamor for more.  Only he knows when it's done, I just hope he does a good job educating us that it has, indeed, concluded.	2004-06-16

I'm tempted to give it more stars just to bring the average up, but I'll stay true to how I feel.<br />Cussler crafted a world, and is now licensing it out.  Truthfully I can't recall the crew of the Golden Buddha from prior novels, but that's neither here nor there.  More important is did I enjoy this?<br />Yes.  Yes I did.<br />The ship fits Cussler's world perfectly.  The crew felt less like individuals and more like cloned personalities, but that's understandable.  A ship needs a full crew, and each member is given limited time in the spotlight, so they never fully flesh out - a problem hopefully solved in future \\"episodes.\\"<br />The caper works.  It has twists, it has turns, but it works.  Maybe the other reviewers are right, maybe it didn't and I was influenced more by the margarita's and Acapulco sun than I thought, but nothing in this plot felt too \\"out there.\\"  Sure, the ship isn't believable, and the fact that there are experts in everything on it might not work, but it's explained in the plot ($$$), so it works well enough.<br />If you're a Cussler fan itching for a fix I recommend this whole-heartedly.  It isn't up to Cussler snuff, but it's written a bit more fluidly than the Kemprecos spinoff.<br />If you aren't a Cussler fan you won't like this.<br />And if you've yet to discover Cussler's work start there, but remember to return here after you've gone through his novels.	2004-06-10
US	37293132	R3GAEHDM3EBLS9	0399150803	642490368	Trojan Odyssey (Dirk Pitt Adventure)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Dragging but enjoyable	If you've never read Cussler, all his books are done via formula.  Essentially they're all the same, but you'll never complain about the retread.  They're all the same, yet all very entertaining.<br />This book is Cussler's last (though not the last of the series).  It suffers for that reason, as Cussler strives to tie loose ends.<br />The reigns are being passed from Dirk Sr to Dirk Jr (a convenient appearance, but not wholly unbelievable).  At the same time the reigns are being passed from Clive to his son.  <br />The story is entertaining, and likely was likely read by the writers of The Day After Tomorrow.  It was novel before the movie, might be tired after, but this came first.<br />There are some creepy moments between Dirk Jr and his sister, as she's set up to be a sexy character despite spending much of her time alone with her brother in the middle of the ocean - am I the only one that sees this?  Couldn't the editor have stepped in on these?<br />I won't complain much, though.  Cussler has given us many, many (many) entertaining reads, and even though he ends on a dip it is a necessary one, and still a solid effort.<br />If you're a Cussler fan buy it.  If you're not yet a Cussler fan buy this, along with some older ones and read those first.<br />Adventure fans will not go wrong.	2004-06-10
US	37293132	R1LBP38AP5IKQB	0312983220	931157258	Area 7 (Scarecrow Series)	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Pretty Weak	I can tolerate some level of unrealistic aspects.  I'm a huge fan of the redundant Clive Cussler beach reads, so I'm used to things happening that probably couldn't.<br />This pushed it, though.<br />It wasn't simply the action.  Unrealistic action maybe I could tolerate.  Maybe.  The characters, though... ouch.<br />I'll put it this way - at one point a man turns to the main character and asks what happened to his father.  &quot;Well, he was hung upside down, lowered into a pool, and eaten by killer whales.&quot;  &quot;Oh, thanks, the military wouldn't tell me,&quot; the young man responds.  Only in Matthew Reilly's world could someone find out his father wasn't simply killed in action but used as a giant worm in killer whale fishing - fed alive to the huge beasts head first - and not bat an eye.<br />People fall hundreds of feet, &quot;faster, faster, faster&quot; only to be stopped by a solid rope without so much as a dislocated shoulder.  Little boys eerily know the future.  Too many different factions and useless plot twists, such as a brief trip to space.  <br />It just seems like Reilly was busy playing Half Life while watching Con Air and decided it could all be made into an interesting novel wrapped around the president.<br />It failed.  Just try to read this without throwing it out the window.  Everything is too convenient, nothing is realistic, and half the dialogue would sound better in a comic book aimed at 12 year olds.  Only worth reading if you pick it up used.	2004-06-10
US	37293132	R2X9NCCN5XPXOH	0613494156	156360117	The Ice Limit	Books	5	0	1	N	N	The duo's best	Preston and Child are very interesting writers, but typically they dwell more towards the supernatural side.  Not ghosts exactly, but stories that need scientific disbelief greatly suspended.<br />That isn't nearly as true with this book.  It's more primal.  Rather than man vs some form of strange beast, it's simply man vs the elements (and, of course, man vs man).  <br />It makes for a more exciting read.  Nothing feels terribly contrived (though, of course, some twists are), and there's an interest in the process througout.<br />It's a story about greed and engineering, and that melds together quite well.  Highly recommended for someone interested in a whimsical novel of this kind.	2004-06-10
US	37293132	R321F1W9UUJLK3	0446607177	11618814	Riptide	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Should have been better	Ok, I admit it, I'm a sucker for cheap adventures.  Can't help it, I just am.<br />This book should have been great.  Pirates, water, traps, treasure - all the right pieces, but it can be so difficult to properly balance these pieces.<br />Preston and Child made it 3/4 through the book before their pieces toppled.<br />The first three quarters are great.  Exciting, entertaining, they'll keep you glued.<br />The book falls in the end, though, as characters seem to change too drastically, and much of what has been set up topples in the wind.  <br />Would I recommend this?  Absolutely.  It will be a let down, and sometimes that's worse than a book that's terrible from the start, but the bulk of this book is the duo at the top of their game, and it's worth purchasing for that alone.	2004-06-10
US	37293132	R1LUYZ4EX83KXZ	0843949880	48429437	City Infernal	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Decent, but not outstanding.	I bought this book because Edward Lee was wearing a Black Flag shirt in his picture.  Black Flag fans have to have interesting ideas, right?<br />Well, I guess this was a decent time waster until Wes Eisold kicks out his novel.<br />Yes, Edward Lee had some good ideas.  Sometimes, though, they're just packed too quickly.  The puns in Hell start quickly and make you gag.  They lose steam fairly quickly, too, and you wish he'd just stop and take himself a bit more seriously.  <br />That's the problem overall - tone.  It's a book about Hell, with Lucifer among the key characters, yet it has difficulties deciding if it should be serious or a parody.  Either one could have resulted in a great novel, but a mix of the two wasn't the best choice.<br />Of course, there's a thin line of success with subject matter like this.  It's hard to find the balance I suppose.<br />Overall it's readable.  Nothing amazing, nothing memorable, but readable.<br />Did I mention that the angel was named Angelique?  I suppose all the thousands of angels in Lee's world have the word 'angel' in their name...	2004-06-10
