I found it somewhat implausible though that Jennifer steadfastly refused to inject her being battered by her husband into her trial, despite the constant insistence by her attorney. I also found Jennifer to be so cold as to be again unrealistic, especially considering that she was facing the death penalty. However despite these and other weaknesses, it was good enough to easily keep me reading to the very end.	2004-06-24

There were moments and potential for greatness, but it never quite reached that crescendo. There was a long dream sequence that I found confusing and actually boring.

It's hard to articulate and put in perspective these two books (really one book just split up) because if I compare it to Swan Song or Boy's Life..well, there just is no comparison. But that's like comparing something really good with the sublime. Either Swan  Song or Boy's Life could be considered a once in a lifetime achievement for the writer, but this said, I would say that the volumes of Speak The Nightbird are really good, especially considering that I never thought that the premise would be that interesting. The fact that Mr.McCammom pulled it off is a testament to his talent. I found that I pretty much sailed through the 900 pages as smoothly as a hot knife goes through butter. The story is very \\"interesting\\", and honestly there was rarely a dull moment in the books. It rarely reaches that high pitch that some books reach, but it sustains a steady, very readable pitch all the same. If you are a McCammon fan, then you must read the two volumes. If you're a new reader, than there are others of his I would read first, but I would get to these all the same eventually. Of course, I will read ANYTHING McCammon writes and I hope he's not done!	2004-03-11

I was very bored. I read about 1/3 of the book, hoping it would kick into a higher gear or at least grab me on some level, but it just rambles along.

This book will keep you turning the pages until the end, at which point you may be asking yourself why a sequel has not been written. McCammon is just a great writer. He has written some of the best books I have ever read. This is not his best, but even his lesser novels are great. His ability to write different types of books is astounding. To go from this, to Swan Song, to Boy's Life..Let's just say that anything from McCammon is very satisfying, and when he's great, he's breathtaking. Although this book does not quite reach that level, it has periods when it does. To be truley honest, it is a 4 1/2 star-er.	2003-12-15

This was an o.k. read, particularly after about 3/4's of the way through, but it is only a slightly better than average read at best. It was good, but it just didn't rise to a level higher than a 3 star for me, or as good as many other murder mystery writers. I also had trouble with the concept that the police, in a high level murder investigation, would have a psychologist tagging along with them in dangerous situations and all the way up until the end (although I haven't read any other Stephen White novels so I don't have anything to compare it to). Pick up if you've run out of other books to read, otherwise...	2003-10-30

I give this one star to bring down the overall rating. This reader's statement that the last 50 pages were somewhat interesting, and that the reader kept waiting for something to happen, are also true. I read this because I like the author, and I kept on because of the reputation of the author, but there is no tension, twists, etc to this story. It just goes on..and on..and on..The problem is that it is described as an espionage thriller, and it's not. It might be good if reviewed within another genre, but not this one.	2002-10-20

I hate to throw cold water on anything written by RRM, and I'm actually not. I'm just not giving it the 5 stars as everyone else has. Let me say, I have already read Boy's Life and Swan Song-Swan Song probably being one of the best books I have ever read. I picked up a tattered copy of They Thirst-the reviews were terrific. But I've got to say that this book does not compare to Boy's Life or Swan Song. Had I read it first, or when it was originally written, I probably could have written a better review. But Boy's Life and particularly Swan Song, are such excellent reads that I cannot review They Thirst without comparing them to these other two. Maybe I missed something. I could be wrong, but &quot;They Thirst&quot; seemed a little predictable to me and it bogged down in parts. And it didn't have the..I don't even know how to explain it. The other two were 3 dimensional, in full color, and as brilliant as laser light. This one was more 2 dimensional with faded colors. Perhaps someone who has read all 3 can explain it better than I. Anyway, I gave it 4 stars, but really it's probably closer to 3 and a half. Sorry..	2002-05-07

I rarely give any book even 5 stars-it really has to be cuts above a 4 star, but I can't say enough about this book. There are so many layers, levels, and subplots to this book. To be honest, even though it was over 900 pages, I didn't want it to end. Even more incredible, there wasn't one significant soft spot, or part where I got bored. And yes, I have read \\"The Stand\\", and this book is NOT a knock-off of that. This book definitely stands on its own, and may actually be better in some ways. I read reviews that stated that people had read the book long ago and had not forgotten it, and had even re-read it. I think that will be true for me also. I loved this book and I think you will too. (Also, pick up his \\"Boy's Life\\"-that's also a very good read).	2002-03-24

Let's first agree that if you're against abortion on any terms, then you won't like this book. It's obviously pro-choice for late-term abortions under certain circumstances, but straddles the fence on earlier ones. If you can get past this, then this is quite a good read which only gets better as the book goes along. Some of it can be considered simplistic, but there's enough weaving and bobbing to maintain considerable interest. The farther I got in this book, the more trouble I had putting it down. Definitely a satisfying read deserving of 4 stars.	2002-02-27
