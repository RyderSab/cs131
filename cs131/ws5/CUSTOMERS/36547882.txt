I thoroughly enjoyed reading his book as well. <br /> <br />First of all, you need to realize that Dr. Dean is not a practicing physician.  (He doesn't see patients or perform procedures and diagnoses)  However, he claims to spend a lot of time reading research studies, something many busy physicians may not have time to do.  So, in a sense he has a different kind of experience - knowledge gained from study, not from first-hand experience.  This is good because it's a different view from what your doctor may have. <br /> <br />In this book, Dr Dean challenges many of the myths that we have about what it means to \\"be healthy\\".  One opinion that he shares with his readers is that being a little overweight may not be such a bad thing.  In fact, it gives the body some reserves in case of illness.  This goes so contrary to what we usually hear, but it really makes you think.  He also challenges a number of myths we hear such as \\"exercise increases your appetite and actually makes you gain weight\\".  He explains why these aren't true.  Dr. Dean also touches on one of my personal favorite myths - germophobia.  Some of our ideas about where germs hide and how to prevent getting sick aren't always correct.  For example, the place in your home with the most germs is not your bathroom - it's your kitchen.  And if you read this book, you may not be so excited to get a hotel room with a jetted tub next time. <br /> <br />The most valuable thing about this book is that it makes you think.  The media loves to hype up health concerns - \\"Will the ebola virus spread and kill us all?\\"  Remember that they want to get your attention so they can increase their ratings.  Think before you react to everything you hear or read.	2005-05-22

This book is full of ideas and techniques to help any stitcher explore new methods and understand how to enhance their work. <br /> <br />The beginning of this book shows how your materials can make a difference.  Using linen instead of aidacloth can change the way the final product looks.  There are also examples of how the resolution (number of stitches per inch) can impact the look as well.  The author contrasts how backstitch around the stitching looks versus stitching without.  She also shows different types of threads - Waterlillies and Watercolours thread, silk ribbon thread, varigated thread, metalic thread and blending filaments.  There are examples of how beads can be used to enhance your work. <br /> <br />I really like the section that shows different types of stitches (yes, there really is more than just the \\"x\\" stitch!)  the queen stitch, the eyelet stitch, the counted chain stitch and more.  These are some of the stitches I've seen on samplers but didn't know how to stitch.  The author also includes an informative and detailed section on hardanger.  I gave it a try and it's a joy to create!  <br /> <br />The book also contains a pattern library, which has some nice patterns. <br /> <br />This is a fantastic resource book on every aspect of cross stitch.  Every serious stitcher should keep a copy of this book on-hand.	2005-05-22

This was the first book on houseplants that I ever purchased, and it is a good all-around houseplant guide.<br /><br />In the front of the book is general information on selecting, caring for and propagating plants.  There are also a number of photos demonstrating how to arrange plants in attractive settings around your home.  This is nice because the photos in the \\"encyclopedia\\" portion of the book are nice, but don't let you see the impact they can create in a room.<br /><br />There are lots of plants listed in the encyclopedia portion.  Each entry contains background info about the plant as well as care requirements and propagation techniques.<br /><br />Overall, I've been fairly pleased with this book.  It's definitely a good one for beginners.	2005-05-22

This book is absolutely the most comprehensive house plant book out there.  It covers almost every topic I can conceive of and then some.   <br /> <br />There are pages devoted to not only propagating plants, but also watering (quality, temperature method), repotting and caring for your plants.  Not only is there a detailed section on pests and diseases, the book also contains recipes on how to rid your plants of these maladies.  If you are a serious gardener, you will appreciate the descriptions of soil types for different plants and the recipes for a variety of potting soils. <br /> <br />Besides the plant basics, the authors cover how to create beautiful plant groupings.  There are suggestions for how to plant baskets and containers with a variety of plants.  Lots of useful ideas! <br /> <br />The best part of the book is the plant listing section.  Literally hundreds of plants have detailed information about care, light requirements and propagation.  Each listing has color photos and many have special tips out in the margins (for quick reference).  The authors have also included watering, light and fertilization symbols so you can see the plant's requirements at a glance. <br /> <br />I love houseplants, and I really love this book.  It has just about everything in it.  I have been known to just sit and page through it.  I highly recommend this book!	2005-05-22

It contains many sample alphabets using calligraphy pen or brush stroke techniques.  (It seems like when I look through most calligraphy books, they don't have many sample alphabets).  Although I probably have one standard calligraphy style, I like to dabble with ways to letter differently. <br /> <br />Besides offering a good number of lettering techniques, this book also shows some examples of some really beautiful calligraphy works.  Some are just simple cards and some would proabably be worth framing.  Several examples show how to play with calligraphy and create a visual with the letters on the page.  The ideas are absolutely fabulous and will inspire you to explore the creative world of lettering.	2005-05-22

This book has a short \\"introductory\\" section that goes over the basics.  I've seen a number of books that have more general information than this one.  However, I think this book does an outstanding job of giving very specific information on each plant in its listing of 100+ plants.<br /><br />Each listing shows a color photo or drawing of a typical specimen.  At the top of each listing is a rating from \\"Very Easy\\" to \\"Very Difficult\\" on the difficulty of caring for this plant.  This can be very useful when selecting plants.  (It also makes me feel better when I look up a plant that just croaked and found that other people don't have much luck with it either!)  Another handy bit of information is the section on \\"Problems\\".  Each plant listing has a \\"Problem\\" section that includes more than just pest problems, but issues like overwatering, light issues, etc.  When I get a new plant I like to look it up here so I know what I'm getting into.<br /><br />This is definitely a great book to have on hand if you have a number of houseplants.	2005-05-22

Since my husband rebuilt part of our fence, he wanted to tackle the pergola himself.  So, I bought him this book and he really loved it. <br /> <br />The beginning of the book shows a variety of ideas for trellises, arbors and pergolas.  Even if you're not going to build it yourself, the photos, drawings, and descriptions of styles may help you select or design one that you like and fits your house/yard.  My favorite idea from the book was a trellis that goes over the garage door - what a neat idea! <br /> <br />The next section of the book has all the necessary instructions and shows you how to build a number of these structures.  This could come in handy if you decide to build it yourself.  <br /> <br />Section three offers some suggestions for plants that will climb up structure.   <br /> <br />The final portion of the book goes over the different types of tools you may need for your project.  There are also drawings and descriptions to help the novice learn the basic building and wood-working skills needed for these projects. <br /> <br />Although we haven't started our pergola yet, I'm sure this book will come in handy.  We've definitely been enjoying looking through it to see what kind we might want!	2005-05-22

I have read plenty of personal finance books, but I usually get new insight and ideas from each one. <br /> <br />I do have to say that getting out of debt and being financially secure can be difficult in our society.  Everywhere you go you see ads for something you just \\"can't live without\\".  Everyone else has it, why shouldn't you?  You have a credit card, why not use it?  You will have to get past these ideas to understand what it means to be financially responsible.  It may go against everything that advertisers and credit card issuers are telling you, but you have to change your mindset. <br /> <br />Mary offers a good strategy for getting out of debt - creating an emergency fund and paying down your debts.  This is fairly typical of most personal finance books.  She covers the dangers of credit cards, tips to saving on car purchases and how to keep your household bills from getting out of hand.  She also addresses \\"home equity loans\\", which I believe is an extremely important topic these days.  Taking equity out of your home to pay off a credit card that you used to buy dinner several times a week (and now have nothing to show for it) is not a smart idea.   <br /> <br />One area that I thought was particularly interesting was her view on college tuition debt.  I personally did go to a rather expensive college and racked up a good bit in student loans.  However, my career field made it possible to pay these off fairly easily.  But if you choose a low-paying field, you may have difficulty paying off the loans.  No college student thinks about this up-front.  We have dreams of getting that perfect career and going to the best college we can possibly get into.  But, you need to think of the value of the education in terms of future potential earnings.  In some cases it may not make sense to spend money on the most expensive university.  And if you don't get that great job at the end of the four years, you may find yourself unable to repay your loans.  So, this is definitely something to think about! <br /> <br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book, as it was thought-provoking and also contained some good practical advice.  If you are in debt, this book could really help you change your spending practices and help you get out of the hole.  You will have to change your way of thinking - there is no \\"magic bullet\\" that will allow you to spend beyond your means and remain debt-free.  But, you may realize that financial peace of mind is more important than buying all of the latest \\"stuff\\"!	2005-05-22

This book is more practical than some decorating books I've seen.  It goes beyond just photos of beautiful rooms with commentary.  The pages inside explode with colorful decor and practical ideas.   <br /> <br />One of the nice things I noticed is that there are sections where the author points out different components in the room (and there is literally a line drawn from that piece in the photo to the commentary about that design element).  Sometimes I find it hard to think about what makes a room warm and friendly.  I know it when I see it, but I couldn't really tell you off the top of my head.  Since this book points those things out, it really draws your attention to those important details. <br /> <br />The author also does a great job of demonstrating how small touches can transform a room as there are photos of the same room with a few things changed (perhaps a different duvet in the bedroom or adding some flowers during the summer).  These subtle changes can really change the look of the room, especially if you want your home to reflect the different seasons.  There are photos that show how you can bring the outdoors in and change the feel of the room throughout the year.  What a wonderful idea to keep your room fresh! <br /> <br />This book also contains information and ideas of how to make your own decorating touches - perhaps a picture gallery or a mirrored door that fools the eye.  How about ideas on stenciling a room?  The book goes beyond showing the idea, but also contains a materials list and instructions on how to complete the project. <br /> <br />This book is a wonderful and practical resource for decorating ideas.  And if you want to change up your rooms periodically without doing a complete makeover, you'll find this book very handy!	2005-05-22

This particular book shows a number of jewelry styles and techniques - making wire jewelry, using clay beads, using real thread in jewelry (instead of beading wire), creating jewelry that looks more \\"professional\\" (more like what you see in stores) and bead weaving.  The author also includes a number of other applications for beading - from dressing up flower pots to adding style to shoes. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book for its variety of techniques and projects.

I purchased this book because I enjoyed just leafing through it and looking at all of the projects inside.  Many of the designs offered me inspiration for my own jewelry creations.  One thing that made this book stand out when I looked through it was that the margins were used to show the jewelry and point out what kinds of beads were used in each design.  This made it really easy to see the design impact of different types of beads and help me to select what elements I want to use in my own jewelry. <br /> <br />The book also contains instructions on how to create the jewelry and lots of helpful hints and background information.  She includes comments on such things as what to consider when purchasing beads over the internet and where to find the tools you will need (maybe in the toolbox in your garage!).  Lots of good, practical advice.   <br /> <br />I found this book to be very informative and inspiring.  I can't wait to get back to my beading!	2005-04-05

After all, I grew up with Sesame Street and the Muppet Show.  I was always fascinated with the strange and creative creatures that he came up with.  This book is a gold mine of his ideas and sketches - some that you will recognize and some that you have probably never seen. <br /> <br />This is sort of an odd book for me to have.  I don't collect books based on movies or TV shows.  But this one doesn't really fall into that category at all.  It's more of an artist's diary and sketchbook.  I enjoy just paging through it to look at all of the wonderous things Jim Henson imagined.  His work seems to have something \\"odd\\" to it that I can somehow connect with and be fascinated by it. <br /> <br />I think anyone who has enjoyed Jim Henson's productions will probably enjoy looking through this book.  It's an adventure to page through time after time.	2005-03-20

This book contains an abundance on information on the face, body and hair.  The book is very readable and has many detailed sections: <br /> <br />The Face - Beauty Basics, Skincare, Facials, Aging, Ways of the Flesh (acne, etc), and Makeup <br /> <br />Hair - Haircare, Hair Color, Haircuts and Styles <br /> <br />The Body - Bath & Body, Hands & Feet, The Spa <br /> <br />One thing that I like about this book is that it contains a listing of what products the author recommends.  Not all of them are expensive department-store cosmetics!  She also lists solutions for things like frizzy hair, flat hair, and split ends.  There is a section on what types of soap to avoid, etc.  The information is just endless. <br /> <br />The section on cosmetics describes how to apply makeup to get different effects.  And, of course, there are lots of \\"before and after\\" makeover photos!  Those are just full of ideas. <br /> <br />Have you ever wanted to try some home-made beauty products?  How about a Tuscan Protein Pack for your hair?  Or an Aussie Tea Treatment?  Perhaps and Oats and Groats Exfoliating Mask?  There are lots of fun recipes included in the book, too. <br /> <br />Have you ever been to a spa?  Do you know what they offer or what questions to ask?  There is a section in this book on spas that can help get you \\"in the know\\" before you go. <br /> <br />I also appreciate that the author warns readers about the hazards of skin cancer from sun exposure.  It demonstrates that she's concerned about long-term beauty and health and not just out for the latest fad. <br /> <br />To top it off, there are fun sections that show timelines of different styles.  They will really give you a view of how times have changed! <br /> <br />Overall, this is a really informative, comprehensive book that explains so much about beauty and offers practical advice and solutions.  I would recommend it to any woman who wantsto look her best!	2005-03-20

Other houseplant books are an \\"encyclopedia\\" of the different kinds of plants and also includes information on care, propagation, etc.  This particular book doesn't go into detail on very many specific plants, so if that's what you are looking for, I would suggest \\"The House Plant Encyclopedia\\" by Jantra/Kruger or John Evans's \\"The Complete Book of Houseplants\\". <br /> <br />However, this is one of my favorite houseplant books.  Although it contains information on care and propagation, it contains lots of ideas for arranging plants and making small gardens.  The gardens it covers include: <br /> <br />Tabletop gardens <br />Ivy Topiaries <br />Orchids <br />Holiday Plants <br />Forcing bulbs <br />Windowsill gardens <br />Seasonal Gardens <br />Plant Collections <br />Exotic and Artful <br />Tropicals <br />Decorating with Plants <br /> <br />Since the book is a \\"Better Homes and Gardens\\" publication, it also includes plenty of photos of rooms with plants and flowers.  I thought I was running out of room for more houseplants, but some of the rooms they show have quite a number of plants and are truly \\"Indoor Gardens\\".  I think those rooms are inspiring because plants can really bring a room to life and make it comfortable unlike anything else. <br /> <br />If you want to add some indoor gardens to your house, I recommend this book.  It will give you ideas other than just sticking your plant in a pot and sitting it in the window!	2005-03-19

I picked it up because it sounded like an interesting story and I wanted to hear a personal account of the Nazi treatment of Jews during WWII.   <br /> <br />This book had me completely enveloped in its story.  I could not put it down because I wanted to know what would happen next.  The story is about a Polish girl and her experiences during WWII.  Although she was not a Jew, she witnessed firsthand the horrors of what happened to them.  She saw that they were rounded up and baricaded into the ghettos.  She could have looked the other way or closed her eyes to the nightmares, but she decided to help some Jews that she met.  You won't believe what she did to try to save them. <br /> <br />Reading the story from someone who was there really made it real to me.  I couldn't put the book down and found myself reading it over lunch at work.  There were times I had to put it away because it was just overwhelming.  And there were times that I wept with the author over the horrible things that happened. <br /> <br />This is a such a moving book.  I highly recommend it to others who want to hear a first-hand account of what it was really like in Poland during the time of the German Nazis.  I think I like this book better than the Diary of Anne Frank, although both are good.	2005-03-19

First, there is a \\"self-diagnosis\\" chart section in the front.  If you have a bad headache, stiff neck, sick stomach, etc, you can go through the flowchart and get an idea of what might be wrong.  This is not to replace a doctor's diagnosis, but it really helps me determine if I'm being overly-concerned or if I should see a doctor.  I definitely use that section of the book. <br /> <br />There are also sections of the different systems of the body that include descriptions of diseases.  A little while back I was having problems with my digestive system.  It really helped to read the section on colitis and Crohn's disease to understand more about them so that when my doctor discussed them, I could better understand him. <br /> <br />There are also sections on First Aide, caregiving at home, selecting physicians, and even a section on terminal illness and death.  Though those last few items are things we don't really want to think about, there is information about how to handle making arrangements and whatever else needs to be done. <br /> <br />There is also a drug dictionary in the back which can come in handy, plus a medical glossary. <br /> <br />Overall, I'm glad that I added this book to my library.  It has an abundance of useful information about illness and medicine.  I do have another medical reference guide as well, but it's not nearly this comprehensive.  I think everyone should have a book like this on their shelves. <br /> <br />	2005-03-19

This means we usually can't grow many of the plants that most people in our community do.  So, my husband and I went to the bookstore and found this book.  There were others on shade gardening, but this had the best photography.  The publisher obviously used high-quality printing techniques on this book to get the vivid color.  So, this makes just a beautiful book to look at.  I used to feel a little disappointed that our yard was so shaded (except that it's cooler in the hot Texas sun than others!), but when I saw this book I realized we could make it into quite a gem. <br /> <br />I will admit that I am a novice gardener, but I found this book inspiring with lots of ideas for plants that we could use in the shade.

The book is about 100 pages and when you open it up, most pages have a full-page photo on one side and text on the other.  The text discusses some background info on the plants pictured and a \\"How to do it\\" section that describes the plants needs.  One thing I really like about this book is that as you page through the book, the pages that cover specific plants have a summary of info of that plant in the margin.  This always includes the basic info you need - light, watering, fertilizing, etc. <br /> <br />This book isn't as in-depth as some, but it's more of an idea book.

After reading their credentials, I would really trust any info in this book.   <br /> <br />Not only is this book informative, but the photographs are spectacular.  Lots of beautiful pictures of cactus in natural settings. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this book as a detailed reference book for anyone interested in collecting and growing cactus and succulents.	2005-03-19

It is a vegetarian cookbook, but I hardly noticed with all of the great recipes inside.  It, of course, contains all of the basics like falafel, humus, and Moussaka, but there is so much more in this cookbook!  One of my favorite recipes is the Cucumber-Yogurt Salad.  It is wonderfully refreshing and makes a great side for a lunch.  The book also contains some delightfully different recipes - green beans in tomato sauce, zucchini patties, and eggplants with cinnamon. <br /> <br />The recipes in this book are easy to make, so any cook should be able to prepare them.  I would recommend this book to anyone who want to add some Greek recipes to their repetoir.  Although it is a vegetarian cookbook, non-vegetarians will enjoy it too!	2004-12-18

The recipes are delicious and not very difficult to prepare.  I made a chicken salad recipe from this cookbook that uses dried cherries and I really love it!  I've probably made it 4 times already, and others have really liked it as well.  I have a lot of cookbooks in my collection, and some that I've never even cooked out of, but this is not one of them!  I will definitely use this cookbook.   <br /> <br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this cookbook.	2004-12-18

This is one that really stands out among their cookbooks. <br /> <br />The recipes in this book are delicious, but require some amount of work.  If you want to throw together a quick dessert for your family, this is probably not the book for you.  I couldn't resist a cookbook with recipes like Creme Brulee Tart,  Sacher Torte, and Ribbon-of-Cranberry Cheesecake.  I made the English Trifle recipe and it is to die for!  That is the first recipe in which I've had to make Creme Anglaise (which is sinfully rich!)  I've also made the trifle for other people and it never fails to impress.  It tastes like it came from a pastry kitchen and people can't believe I made it myself. <br /> <br />This would be a good cookbook for someone who wants to make impressive desserts.  There are pages in the back on making beautiful garnishes and other special touches.  The photography shows how elegant you can make your desserts and it's no wonder that there is a section entitled Dessert Party Menus. <br /> <br />The book is divided into the following sections: Chocolate Fantasies, Bounties of the Season, Petite Temptations, Sweet Occasions, Old-World Classics and Cool Sensations. <br /> <br />Although this book may not be for everyone, those who like to spend a little time to make really spectacular desserts will want this one on their bookshelves.	2004-12-18

I haven't made a recipe from it that disappointed me. <br /> <br />The recipes are not difficult to make, so anyone should be able to cook from this book.  The food turns out a bit sophisticated.  You could easily use some of these recipes for a dinner party. <br /> <br />Two of the recipes I really enjoyed from this book were Mustard Ginger Pork Chops and Minestrone.  The pork chops were wonderful - you basically add a simple marinade (pretty easy to do!).  The minestrone is wonderful!  It is probably my favorite soup ever.  It uses ham to give it a smoky flavor, then you add a number of veggies and pasta to it, and top it off with cilantro and parmesan cheese.  This is a great soup to make at the beginning of the week and have it for lunch every day for the rest of the week.  I've made this soup so many times and I've even tried to freeze it (although I wouldn't recommend that).  This is also a good soup to fix ahead of time if you're going to have guests.  Add a salad and some bread and you have quite a nice lunch. <br /> <br />Besides the recipes, the photography in this book is amazing.  It's quite different than other cookbooks.  I would have to consider the photos as \\"art\\" because they are of the quality of framed photographic art.  I keep thinking of taking this book off of my cookbook shelf and using it as a \\"coffee table book\\" because it is so beautiful. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this cookbook to almost anyone.  The recipes are simple but elegant and the pictures make the book a joy just to look through.	2004-12-18

Maida Heatter and I share something in common - we love to bake and we love to share our baked goods.  Her introduction is entitled \\"Happiness is Baking Cookies\\" and I couldn't agree more! <br /> <br />This cookbook is wonderful!  I probably have a dozen or more cookie/dessert cookbooks, but this one contains my favorite recipe, Moravian Wafers.  This cookie isn't just my favorite one to make - I don't think I've ever had a cookie this wonderful anywhere!  They are absolutely addictive.  They are very unusual, but every time I make them everyone wants the recipe. <br /> <br />Maida Heatter's cookbooks are always pretty sophisticated with lots of very specific directions to make the cookies come out absolutely perfect (like using parchment paper and rotating the cookies during baking to ensure they are all cooked evenly).  But don't let that keep you from trying some of them.  I don't always follow all of the detailed instructions, and they still come out really good, but perhaps not all uniform like bakery cookies.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this cookbook to anyone who enjoys baking cookies (or someone who thinks it's worth a little effort to eat delicious cookies).  My favorite cookie book!	2004-12-18

I should start off by saying that this cookbook is not for someone who wants to throw together a pie quickly.  This cookbook has recipes that take a little work, but are definitely worth the effort!  This book is entitled \\"The Pie and Pastry Bible\\" for a reason - it is a bible for spectacular desserts that taste like they came from a pastry chef.  I've had plenty of pies from bakeries that haven't tasted nearly as good as the ones in this book.   <br /> <br />Most of us have probably eaten pies where the crust was just functional - meant to hold the filling in, but really tasteless.  How about pie crusts that could stand on their own without the filling?  The crusts in this cookbook are that delicious!  They may take a little effort, but the results are spectacular. <br /> <br />This cookbook is a wonderful source of recipes if you really want to impress someone.  You will be amazed to discover that you, too, can make terrific pastries.  Rose's directions will walk you through it step-by-step. <br /> <br />Bottom line - I absolutely love this cookbook, but I admit it may not be for everyone.  However, if you are a serious baker, this one should definitely be on your shelf! <br /> <br />	2004-12-18

Once I saw the recipes inside, I just had to copy some of them down.  They sounded absolutely delightful. <br /> <br />I am very happy that, years later, I found this cookbook which contains many of the same recipes.  I excitedly bought it and couldn't wait to get it home to make some terrific cookies from it. Since then, I've made several recipes from this book.  The lemon-lime cookies have a delicious icing and my husband loves them.  I've also made the chocolate-cherry stripe cookies and they came out very cute.  The orange madeleine recipe makes a very delicate, simple, almost cake-like cookie.  I've had requests for that recipe from those who tasted it.  This cookbook also has a number of charming recipes to make \\"cute\\" cookies for kids.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this cookbook to most cooks.  I think it makes a great \\"mom\\" cookbook because the recipes aren't too difficult and many of the cookies would appeal to kids.  If you are looking for a sophisticated cookie cookbook, you would probably find one of Maida Heatter's cookbooks more to your liking.  This cookbook is fun, though, and has some very tasty recipes!	2004-12-18

I cook quite a bit and have over 100 cookbooks, but this is one I use frequently. <br /> <br />I used the waffle recipe in the cookbook with my Belgium Waffle iron and they were terrific!  They are tender (not crisp), with a delicate taste.  Anyone who stays at my house overnight gets them for breakfast and they're always a hit!  I make a blueberry sauce (cook frozen blueberries in a saucepan with a little water and a bit of lemon juice - then add some sugar to taste).  These are my favorite breakfast item. <br /> <br />My husband took it upon himself to make me the carrot cake from this cookbook for my birthday.  I was absolutely stunned!  It was fantastic - but he has never baked ANYTHING from scratch!  (In fact, I've never known him to bake anything at all...)  It was really impressive - you would have thought he'd been baking for years! <br /> <br />I just really enjoy this cookbook.  I also like the extra info they provide (for example - why they use buttermilk for waffles instead of regular milk).  It's very informative.   <br /> <br />If you like to bake, you will love this one!	2004-10-28

First, I thought the murders committed in the book were overly-violent.  If that's not something that bothers you, you may like this novel better than I did.  The other thing that bothered me was that I found some of the plot twists a little beyond belief.  I like plot twists that are cleverly constructed so I find myself thinking &quot;yeah, why didn't I catch on to that?&quot; not &quot;where did that come from?&quot;.  Maybe I missed something when I was reading the book, but I just found some of it too far-fetched for me.  I did find myself wanting to keep reading, though, so it wasn't bad.  I guess I just prefer other authors better than this one.	2004-01-02

I was disappointed with this book and couldn't buy into it since his message was so different.  The discussions on meditation and religion just seemed so out of place and even though I consider myself to be religious (a Christian), they didn't appeal to me at all.  Maybe I got caught off-guard with this one, but I don't want to keep this book on my bookshelf, let alone recommend it to others.	2004-01-02

Dave's personal story of how he lived the &quot;rich lifestyle&quot; and then lost it all really speaks to the myth of &quot;having it all&quot;.  He makes the point that we don't have to &quot;have it all&quot; (or &quot;own it all&quot;) to be happy.  That said, he offers a very solid and straight-forward plan on how to break out of the debt cycle and save for the future.  The book includes a number of ways to change your thinking and your habits to make you more financially secure.  <br />Since reading this book, I have put many of his ideas into practice.  There is nothing that has added to my personal happiness and security more than knowing I have an emergency fund to cover expenses if something unexpected happens.  I am also almost debt-free and have money saved for retirement.<br />I have recommended this book to others and have even bought a copy (I originally read this at the library) just so I can read it again and lend it to friends.  Everyone needs to read this book!	2003-12-31

Cookbook	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Excellent General Cookbook	I am a cookbook addict (I have 100+ cookbooks in my collection) and the USA Cookbook is one of my favorites!  Sheila Lukins has a wonderful collection of recipes in this book.  Many times I buy cookbooks thinking that the recipes sound great, and then I never actually make anything.  I didn't have that problem with this book as I've made several different dishes.  There's a cherry ice cream recipe in it that my family really enjoys!<br />This is a great general cookbook to have on hand.  It covers a variety of dishes and the recipes are simple enough for most cooks to manage easily.  (You might want to note that I am the kind of cook who likes to make things from scratch, but I'm not always in the mood for something really complicated, either).  Because the recipes are delicious, simple, and would appeal to most people, this book would be a great gift for someone who likes to cook.<br />One of the things I enjoy most about this book is its style.  The author includes informational commentary about regional cuisine and useful food facts besides just the recipes.  I think this is what prompted me to purchase another one of her cookbooks,  The New Basics.  I think I like this book a little better, but both are wonderful.	2003-12-31
