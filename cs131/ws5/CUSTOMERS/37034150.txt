This biography of Henry Jackson Hunt, Chief of Artillery of the Army of the Potomac in the Civil War, is an outstanding example of a biography of an oft-overlooked yet key figure in the Civil War.  Hunt's professional knowledge and expertise led to his prominent contribution to Union victory at Gettysburg, a <BR>battlefield that offered tremendous opportunities to the side that more effectively utilized artillery.  His role in the later<BR>campaigns was reduced by the reduced reliance on artillery on the Virginia battlefields of 1864 &amp; 1865.

My favorite part is the section on Dr. Mary Walker,<BR>the person described by a Confederate officer at the head of this review.

It is poorly-organized,<BR>badly-written in many places (i.e.  &quot;intuitions&quot; such as <BR>Pennsylvania College and the Lutheran Theological Seminary &quot;oozed&quot; higher culture into the Gettysburg area.),<BR>repetitious, and inaccurate (repeats the old myth of repeating carbines in the hands of John Buford's troopers).<BR>     The author spends only about 150 pages on the actual<BR>aftermath of the battle, and part of that is allotted to a brief<BR>account of the history of the park to the present day.  The<BR>first 100+ pages is devoted to the author's sketchy account<BR>of the battle and the experience of the citizens during the <BR>ordeal.  <BR>     Certainly this is all gripping history, but it has been told<BR>better, in more detail, and with better writing and focus in <BR>numerous other books on the aftermath of the battle, books<BR>that have been available for many years.  I understand that the inaccurate back cover statement about this being the <BR>first &quot;aftermath&quot; book is the publisher's misleading statement, but the author should have called them on it.<BR>     The author was certainly aware of the other  &quot;aftermath&quot;<BR>accounts because he cites so many of them in his biblio-<BR>graphy.  Unfortunately, it is not only an incomplete listing of <BR>&quot;aftermath&quot; books, but at least one key book is listed with an<BR> incomplete title and thus will be difficult to find, thanks to the<BR>author (who used the complete title in his notes).<BR>     Look for some worthwhile books on this topic.  This author has done no one a service with this poor excuse for<BR>a book on the aftermath of Gettysburg.  Soldiers, civilians,<BR>medical personnel, relief workers, and even the dead horses deserve better treatment than this failure of a book.	2003-09-08

The<BR>author tells the little-known story of the struggle for the Bliss<BR>Farm at Gettysburg in vivid prose augmented by choice<BR>illustrations and photographs.  The reader may or may not<BR>agree with the author's conclusions, but the book is certain<BR>to create debate and discussion!	2003-06-10

This is an astonishing book, one that defies easy categorization or even any categorization at all.  It is by turns<BR>thought-provoking, horrifying, and inspiring, and the buyer will never regret the money spent on it.  This book will stay with the reader for a long time to come.	2003-06-06

There is<BR>generally no relation between the period photographs and<BR>the modern photographs, which could have been taken in<BR>someone's backyard (yours or mine!).  The text is negligible<BR>in volume and quality.  Save your money for something you<BR>will treasure for years - this book isn't it.	2003-05-29

This is a terrific book on the University - the photographs<BR>are nothing short of amazing.  Mr. Adelman is to be con<BR>gratulated on his execution of this idea.  Everyone who has<BR>attended this school should own this book - it will bring back<BR>fond memories.  I hope we can look for more volumes on<BR>other schools.	2003-05-29

Other reviews have targeted the dubious nature of the <BR>photographic images and their attribution in this work.  The<BR>prospective reader also needs to beware the maps in this<BR>creation.  For example, the 3-D map of the area of Pickett's<BR>Charge on July 3rd shows the &quot;Copse of Trees&quot; several<BR>hundred feet south of its actual position;  it is shown as being south of Hall's, Harrow's, and even Stannard's brigades, instead of in its actual position.   Let the buyer<BR>beware!	2003-05-28

In addition to telling the story of <BR>John Burns of Gettysburg, author Tim Smith has provided <BR>a wonderful portrait of life in 19th century Gettysburg and lots<BR>of insights into village life in general during that era.  I hated <BR>to have to put this book down for meals and sleep!	2003-05-13
