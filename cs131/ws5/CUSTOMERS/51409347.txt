It is basically a biography of two of the characters in the series. Rayford Steele and Nicolae Carpathia. Once again the typeset and fonts make the book appear to be twice as long as it really is. And though a good read. I did not have the feeling that I had to turn to the next page to see what was happening. <br /> <br />The book follows Rayford starting at age 9 determined to be an airline pilot or a professional athlete. And ends with him as the Airline Pilot we meet in the series. He was a very good athlete in school, but things kept happening to make him just not good enough in any of the sports he played to gain an athletic scholarship. So he accepts an ROTC one. He also accomplishes his goal of a private pilots license before high school graduation.  Though some of the insights he has are a little too mature for the age he has them. <br /> <br />The more interesting story is that of Nicolae Carpathia the Antichrist. And what transpire in order to pick the correct mother and father. And how much of that conspiracy the mother knew nothing about. Nicolae's conception, birth and schooling are covered. And we follow him up to the time where he was returned from his 40 days in the desert. The intelligence and lack of compassion in the boy is truly scary. <br />	2005-10-12

This book is actually filled with adventure. Though the characters are still two dimensional, the writing very simple, and the text font large. It was a page-turner and the best book of this series so far. <br /> <br />In this book we see the Antichrist desecrate the Holy Temple of Israel. And the Mark of the beast being officially placed on worshipers. And the first two bowls of wrath are poured upon the world. The changing of water to blood again and the worshipers of the beast who have the mark inflicted with sores and boils. <br /> <br />The Tribulation Force uses the Co-op to get all the pilots they can into Israel in order to help with the mass Exodus of the Jews out of Jerusalem. And the Chosen People of God who have accepted Christ come under his divine protection. And we see this protection as the forces try to stop these evacuees from reaching Petra. And once again when the Global Community Military tries to assault Petra. The book ends with a devastating attack on Petra that the results are left as a cliffhanger. <br />	2005-10-10

And though the writing is simple and there is very little character development. I still was able to read it on one afternoon. It does help that the book is short. Though it has 380 pages, the typeset and margins make it equivalent to a 100-page book. <br /> <br />In this book we have Carpathia no longer being Mr. Nice guy. He orders that everyone will worship him. And to prove their loyalty they have a choice. They may take the mark of the beast; or have their heads cut off. We do read about the process of choice in Greece. And I have to say the violence is very graphic. <br /> <br />Of course with the mark being applied, those Tribulation Saints that are still out in the Global Community have to flee. And we have the Tribulation Force helping them escape where they can. Of course they cannot help everyone. Though they do what they can. <br /> <br />The end of this book has Carpathia heading to Jerusalem. Where he will desecrate the holy temple and proclaim himself God. Thereby breaking his pact with Israel. <br /> <br />Even though I only rated this book two stars. If you plan to continue the series to its conclusion, as I do, you will need to read it. It introduces new characters and sets up some of the next events. For example I think they will write about the exodus of Gods Chosen from Israel. <br />	2005-10-09

The last book ended with the so-called Antichrist being assassinated and us not sure who was responsible. Here we begin with an influx of 4 million people into New Babylon to morn the passing of Carpathia. <br /> <br />His body is laid in state within a vacuum-sealed Plexiglas coffin. So all may pass and view him. His funeral is set up three days after his death. While the millions who are present watch along with the world on a non-stop TV broadcast, Carpathia rises from the dead. This is where the title of the book comes from, for Carpathia is now suppose to be the indwelt, Satan incarnate. <br /> <br />Carpathia breaks his way out of his sealed coffin to stand in front of the multitude. He stands and starts by using the very words of Jesus, and then switches to those of his own. Warning that all who do not worship him will know that a Tribulation is truly coming. <br /> <br />Mean while, the Tribulation Force members are doing all they can to get back to their home base in the USA. A home base that has been compromised. We watch the race between them race against the GC Peace Keeping forces. <br /> <br />I would like again like to add, that this is not a series you could pick up in the middle. This book will not stand-alone. And though the writing is not the best, it still makes you want to see what comes next. <br />	2005-10-08
US	51409347	R1R96IBMXMSIJP	0425062953	290392889	The War Magician	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Fact or fiction	There is a lot of discussion on whether or not this book is fact or fiction. I picked it up to read because it was a work of \\"Non-Fiction\\". But after reading it I am not sure. The book does have verifiable historical detail. But it is filled with complete conversations of the characters/subjects. It seemed to me to be more of a historical novel. Though I do not think everything in the book is accurate, Most of what he is attributed to have done is plausible. <br /> <br />The War Magician written by David Fisher claims to be a true account of the exploits of the illusionist Jasper Maskelyne during the Second World War.  Mr. Maskelyne comes from a long line of magicians. And like his ancestor who used his magic knowledge to help T.E. Lawrence in Arabia in WW I, he wanted to do his part in WW II. And so he does. His skills are used to help the British forces in developing new and creative weapons of illusion. Like making the armies look larger then they actually were. To innovations in camouflage, which are very interesting. And these camouflage techniques would take a mind such as Maskelyne had to conceive and execute. <br /> <br />The book makes for very interested reading. And just goes to remind us, that with enough ingenuity and hard work, anything can be accomplished. Regardless if the book is all factual, or if there is some embellishment, it is worth the read. <br />	2005-10-04

It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel. <br /> <br />The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from.  <br /> <br />The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far, so I will finish the series. Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not.	2005-09-28

The book starts with a short overview of Rommel's actions in World War I. Then takes us to his command of 7 Panzer in France and going right through the creation and command of the Africa Korps and the desert campaign. And continuing with his command at Normandy in 1944. Lewin uses as his notes the Rommel Papers edited by Liddel Hart to help make his case.  <br /> <br />The book shows us the sterling victories and defeats and what surrounded them. He does not seem to hide any facts from the reader. And gives us a truly balanced perspective of what really transpired. I was pleased to see that this first class analysis of Rommel's command abilities was presented with such honesty. <br /> <br />This book is required reading of anyone interested in the truth of Rommel's campaigns and command abilities.	2005-09-28

Some of the action, as usual, is not plausible. But we do have action in this book. And the authors still manage to make it a page-turner. So if you read the others...go ahead and read it. <br /> <br />Rayford learns the truth about his wife. We have both Chaim Rosenzweig and Hattie come to believe the truth about what is required to be saved, but neither takes that necessary step. Chaim because of pride and Hattie because of hate. I found it hard to believe that a man of Chaim's intellect would allow pride to over ride everything he himself has seen and deduced from hard evidence. And Hattie, well they did a good job with her. She is so annoying I kept hoping she would be written out of the story. <br /> <br />The meeting of the 144,000 takes place in Israel and the Anti-Christ attends, as does the prophets of God. The story line in Jerusalem is well written and you could not only visualize what was transpiring. And the authors did a great job of brining the two prophets to life. And their is very good narrative on the Trumpet Seals as they are unleashed on the earth. <br /> <br />The only thing I would highly recommend is that you make sure to read this book in its proper sequence. It cannot stand on its own. <br />	2005-09-23

It continues just after wrath of the Lamb--a global earthquake in the 21st month of the Tribulation. Our two main characters, Buck and Rayford, are once again the ones the story is built around. But this time you want to keep up with both stories as they work to see who is left alive. We watch them both try and find their spouse's. We also see that the world population is starting to realize they need to take sides...choosing to align with Christ or the Anti-Christ.... At the end of this book we see the beginning of the Trumpet Judgments. <br /> <br />This is the best written of the four book yet. There is actually a couple of twist in this book, which is nice. And once again the story does flow. That and the large print, I was able to read this book in a single afternoon. For the first time, I will go directly to the next book in the series and follow the story line. <br />	2005-09-21

And as I mentioned in the title, this is the best one yet. Though I should have rated it 3 stars, I couldn't. It deserves only three because the plot is not plausible and they do not explain the scriptures well. Just quote them. But then, I could not put the book down. That is why I gave it a four. I just had to read until I finished it.     Two other things bothered me about the book. First I found in the book was the repetition of material from the previous books. Where they trying to bring you up to date without having to read the first two books.... or just trying to fill up enough pages to have a book. Second, I felt as if I was watching a Land Rover commercial.    This book covers the time of the Seven Seals. We actually watch the characters live through six of the seals, and the book ends with the silence of the seventh. We once again focus on two of the tribulation characters again, Buck and Rayford.     Rayford mainly deals with his dilemma about actually working for the Anti-Christ as his pilot. After all, not only is he Born Again now, he is part of the Tribulation Force. But something happens that places him in the position to hear some of the inner planning's of the Anti-Christ, so he stays.    The action packed part of the book is with Buck. Though he works for the Anti-Christ as well. He still writes cover stories exposing the Anti-Christ to those who will pay attention, in an \\"objective\\" way. And is instrumental in helping a famous Jewish Scholar, who the Anti-Christ wants dead, out of Israel. And it is this exciting exodus that keeps you on the edge of your seat.	2005-09-20

It is not as good as the first book. And I knew this as I was reading it. But even having said that, I read it all in one night. I am hoping that this will be a bridge to the third book that will have a better story line.     This book follows the stories of four people we met in book one. They called themselves the \\"Tribulation Force\\": Rayford Steele, an airline pilot; Chloe, his daughter; Cameron \\"Buck\\" Williams, a journalist; and Pastor Bruce Barnes. It took the rapture and losing their families to make these four Christians.     In this book we see the relationship grow rather fast between Chole and Buck. And Chole's father Rayford even finds a woman he will marry by the end of the book. Though how these four decide they should be married is not really reinforced by the plot; very unrealistic.     All four of them, The Tribulation Force, know that Carpathia is the Antichrist. Yet they agree it would be in their best interest for both Rayford and Buck to be employed by him. This leads us to see Carpathia and his dealings through the eyes of these two characters. They are the focus of this book.     I thought the best-written part was the meeting of the Rabbi and Buck with the two witnesses' of Christ at the Wailing Wall. And though the writers do include parts about the Catholic Church, they are obviously not well	2005-09-14

Differrent people, differrent times and nothing to tie them together. But each story line starts off strong. One is about a young boy living in the south in the 1960's. He watches as his fathered is lynched by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Then the next story line takes us to 1929, where a young girl in New Orleans falls in love with her part black piano teacher. To our final story, that brings us back to the great New York blackout of 1977, where a 11 year white boy watches his father beaten to death by a black man wielding a baseball bat. <br /> <br />The book then jumps to the present. Where we meet our New York boy, now a NYPD Detective named Nat Hennessey. Nat is in love with Camilla, who is the grand daughter of the young girl from New Orleans and the piano teacher. And of course the young boy who watched the KKK kill his father, is now a brilliant neursurgeon. <br /> <br />A couple days before Nat and Camilla are to be married, Nat lets a killer go, though he should have arrested him. They deal he made is that the criminal would kill the man that killed Nats father. Instead this leads to the man who killed Nat's father shooting Camilla in the head. <br /> <br />Now we go to our brilliant neurosurgeon, Cush Walker, he was once Camillia's lover. And he is the only one who can save her life by using new technology he has developed. And about this time in the book they discover Camillia is part black. So these two men, who's prejudices are formed by their father's death, must work together to save her. <br /> <br />There seem to be more plot twist then would be necessary in any book. The book also exploits racial discord in every plot line. Both male characters are written well and come across as real. Not perfect, but well filled out charcters. The woman doesn't know her own mind and is willing to drop everything in a moments notice that she has developed because of what she hs learned about her grandmother. I thikNat would have been better off without her in the end. <br /> <br />Unlike most books, that I read in a day or two..this took me a week to plow through. And I would not read it again. But, it wold make a good action movie for today's audiences.	2005-09-08

It is the eight book of Ms Rice in the Vampire Chronicles. I found this book to be an easy read. I would rate it in the top four of the chronicles.    We have an ancient Norse man waking up in the artic, where he went to sleep in darkness. We learn that he had learned of the world through the 'Mind Gift'. And he finally finds a reason to wake. He walks south back into civilization and into Marius' hands.     I wanted to know more of this vampire...but this is a book about Marius. And he has what he needs in Throne, a student/listener hungrey to hear his words. So we have Marius teeling his story to Thorne...And we are in the shadows listening. We some some of th eother books story line through Marius eyes. Which I found interesting.    The story  starts after his creation as a blood drinker. He takes us from Ancient Rome to all the cities he made home. To his first love The Queen of the Dammend, Akasha. Pandora, his second, who he lost because of his anger. Then in Venice he falls in love with Bianca and Amadeo, one leaves because of a lie the other is taken. And eventually to our first book, Lestat, who he sends away. We see he loves to be in love, but his anger drives him to solitude.    Marius learns he has been watched by the Talamasca, with who he develops a sort of realtionship. What appears to me to be the only honest relationship he had. For Marius saw himself as a scholar, and the Talamasca were true scholars.    His life, though having moments of great pleasure, seemed to be filled with tragedy of his own making.  Though if you like the Vampire Chronicles, I do recommend you read this.	2005-08-19

I was able to put it down and took a few days to read it, instead of my normal one to two days. She starts plot lines and does not follow through on them. And the flow of time from chapter to chapter is very erratic.  <br /> <br />The first chapter of this book is very well written. There is a wonderful depiction of village life in tribal India. I felt as if I was there. It makes you want to read the rest of the book.  But this level of writing is not carried through. I also found that the quick glimpse of high tech computer firms corporate backstabbing was very accurate. And the choices they make on whom to fire and keep was right on target. It made me remember why I retired from the work force before I was at the age of forty without any regret and never looked back. <br /> <br />The book does have romance and intrigue. But, the characters are too atypical and our heroine is too perfect. The author does try to let us into the view of a bicultural heritage in today's world. She just seemed to not know how to show is the journey. <br />	2005-08-12

Margaret Mitchell did not want the story continued, and I had enough of Scarlett. Well, I read it. It is not writte in the same style of Ms. Mitchell's. And Ripley moves us out of Tara right away. Both good move on his part. <br /> <br />The book is well written and I actually enojyed reading it now that I am finsihed. It starts with a selfish self-centered middle aged child, Scarlett. We follow Scarlett on her quest to win back Rhett. She left Tara for Atlanta, and follows Rhett to Charleston. Where we see that he will not allow her to hurt him again. But we see her as a determined person, willing to do what ever it takes to reach her goal. She then runs to Savanah, using the pretense of her grandfather's birthday for going. <br /> <br />The story picks up when she leaves it all behind too find her roots in Ireland. In Ireland Scarlett realizes that it was her actions that caused her sorrow. And we see her mature and grow into a woman.  <br /> <br />The author did a good job researching what Charleston and Savanah were like in the 19th Centuary. And I found those parts interesting. As I did reading of life in Ireland. But other then that, it is an entertaining read. Ripley inroduces some fine new characters. But the sequel to Gone With the Wind, I can not see any of this happening.	2005-07-30

But because Irv wants to show how smart he is. He uses editing to make the trio of soldier look guilty. This just shows how far the media will go to show their version of the truth.

Here Sir Ryan has started work as an anaylst for the CIA. His first post is in London under British tutelage on the Russian desk. Though an desk jocky would never be placed in the positions that our hero is in. But this is fiction and is interesting reading.    As we follow the reasoning used by the KGB to remove the Pope from office. Clancy gets us involved in the KGB planning. While at the same time showing us what the CIA is doing in Moscow and what Jack Ryan is doing in London. And how they will all fit into place in the overall story. What we do not see is the execution of the KGBs side to the story. I would have like to see more of that developed since Clancy went to the effort of showing us everyone elses thoughts during the rest of the book. If he had done that I would have given this book 4.5 star rating.    I like the detail Clancy puts into his story. It helps you understanding how the agency work and some of the obstacles involved. Not his best book. But I am very pleased to have read it.	2005-06-05

With this sign or peace and hope, Mr. Peres wrote on what it would take to make the Middle East a new economic center. Where all lived in prospertity and peace. <br /> <br />His vision, which at this time has not progressed very far, is based on that of the European Communities. And the work involved at the end of WWII which brought them to the 1990's. Where the European \\"Economic \\" Community is today. But Mr. Peres explains that if all the countires of the middle east would work toward a common goal of peace and economic unity, that they could be a thriving, propserous community of the world within twenty years. <br /> <br />This book shows me that Israel was ready in 1993 to do what was required to make the whole Middle Eastern region prosperious for all the peoples, regardless of ethnic or religious backgrounds. And that if reason would prevail, they were willing to help make this happen. <br /> <br />This book belongs in every major library. And should be read by any student of politics.	2005-05-19

But this quickly becomes a sub-plot of the book as our heroine is called to work on a case which consist of five burned bodies.  <br /> <br />These five bodies lead our herione on an interesting murder investigation where the bodies just start to continue to grow. This mystery is well written and tied up nicely by the end of the book. The conclusion of the first body we were introduced too, the remains of the catholic nun, are just quickly brushed over. And left me wanting to know more...Other then that, this is a good read. <br /> <br />This book does give you a very good look inside of forensic anthropolgy.

It is a page turner. I do admit that there are various sub-plots within the book. A a myriad of characters with many interrealtionships. But I loved this. And they are all well written. I am sure this book will be made into a movie. <br /> <br />This book brings back Secret Service Agents Sean King and Michelle Maxwell. Only this time they are former agents who have founded their own Private Investigation firm. They are hired to prove the innocence of a man that has been charged with burglarizing the wealthest family in town, the Battles. But rather quickly you will see that this investigation takes a back seat. For our two detectives are brought in as deputies to help solve a quickly growing number of murders by a serial killer.  <br /> <br />I found the investigation to be run in an authentic manner. And a good level of detail. There is some misdirection in the book, that makes it hard to detrmine the killer ahead of time. But I was able to determine the who at the very end before the detectives mentioned it, but not the why. But Baldacci does a good job of tying up all the loose ends. Though the book screams for a sequel. Have a good read...I did.	2005-04-14

He is a Professor of Greek History at Cambridge University. And widly acknowledged as a leading expert on the subject of ancient Greece. This seems to be a perfect book for a brief overview of Alexander and is written in an eassy form. <br /> <br />Who could not be drawn to a book about an amazing young man who was a brilliant warrior king and had conquered the known world at the age of 30.  <br /> <br />What we do not know is what motivated him. And I do not think we will ever know as this book points out. There is no definitive reference of the time to refer too. There is no question that his victories are amazing and worth studying. His impact is still felt today. You cannot travel our world without finding somthing that leads back to Alexander the Great. <br /> <br />He created the Hellenised Middle East. Preparing them for what would eventually be called the Eastern Roman Empire. But what drove him...the drive to do more than his father, a true ambition for divinity, unification of the people under an Hellensitic world or just unreasoning ambition. <br /> <br />Here the author does a great job of guiding us through Alexander's political and military accomplishments. We follows his victorious armies as he conquers the known world. We see that Alexander had an understand of not just tactics on the battlefield, but he also had an understanding of imperialism, Middle Eastern politics, and had a charismatic leadership. <br /> <br />I reccommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the life of Alexander the Great. And what he accomplished....I think you will be pleasently suprised. And will lead you to further study to try and understand this man.	2004-12-04

Those who are allied with each other will not speak with each other. While their enemies somehow know everything. Most of the important action happens offstage, and promised explanations never materialize. <br /> <br />So I would suggest you only read this book if you are a fan of the Amber series and have read the others that come before it.	2004-08-29

But if you haven't read the other books, like myself, you won't have too much trouble following the events of plan B, I may have missed some subtly points by not having a background to pull from.

As with Turow's other novels, this is set in the fictional Kindle County. <br /> <br />Arthur Raven, is the protagonist. He's plain and dull man who wishes he were good-looking and yearns for an exciting love life. He's a success as a corporate lawyer, not because he's brilliant, but because of dogged determination. He is forceably taken from his corporate world and is assigned a criminal case - the appeal of a death row prisoner, triple murderer Rommy 'Squirrel' Gandolph, against his forthcoming execution. Raven's investigation into Gandolph's claim that he didn't commit the 10-year-old murders brings him into conflict with a formidable prosecuting attorney, Muriel Wynn, and with police detective Larry Starczek. Wynn, with Starczek's help, made her name with her successful prosecution of the original case.  Into Raven's life steps Gillian Sullivan, the judge who tried the case but soon after fell from grace when she was jailed for corruption. <br /> <br />The novel has two love stories contained within it's pages. But this does not slow the mystery narrative nor the courtroom antics. Most of the characters are believable and flawed.  <br /> <br />Reversible Errors is a well written story. Which shows the interaction between law and life. This is an engrossing mystery. <br /> <br />	2004-08-01

And that he showed great Barvery in World War I. That he planned some great island hopping strategy during World War II. And did much to help Japan reform and rebuild. But Korea is not an area where his career shines. <br />When conflict broke out in Korea in 1950, MacArthur assumed command of American, South Korean and U.N. forces and drove back the North Korean army to the Yalu river, which is the border between Korea and China. And at center stage was his very risky yet stunning achievement, his amphibious attack behind enemy lines at Inchon. But his total lack of failure to anticipate Chinese entry into the war and his delusion that Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Chinese forces in Formosa could be brought into the war to fight the Communists as a viable force had him lose all credability.<br />Only by General Matthew Ridgway taking command of the Allied ground forces were the Allies able to reverse the trend. General Ridgway took the demoralized Allied troops and transformed them back into a strong fighting force. Which under his command was able to recapture some of the lands lost to the Communist. During this time MacArthur actual came up with a plan to sow a defensive field of radioactive waste on the southern bank of the Yalu. This plan helped Truman to make the to make the decission to dismiss MacArthur at the begining of April 1951.<br />This work is well written and well worth reading.	2004-05-24

The book has a good basis. The bad thing is that the author has not seemed to do his research. Not on the medical advancements he tries to use for the enhancement of the body. Nor in the geographic locations he inaccurately describes. But it is a fun read non-the less.  Pick it up if you have a 2-hour flight. It will pass the time quickly.	2004-02-24

These carzies exploits take them throughout Florida from my home county with Satellite Beach and Cocoa Beach, on down south on both coast, and doesn't stop till we hit the Dry Tortugas.<br />I look at it as a very zany, violent, bizzarro tour of Florida.  That is extremely acurate as far as historical and geographical facts. And some other things, which you would never believe unless you lived in South Florida. And if you do you know his books are close to home. Who ever thought I would be looking forward to see what Serge, the anti-hero would do next.

I own both made for TV movies and all 20 episodes. Darrin McGavin was perfect for the role of Kolchak. I waited every week for a new episode, and was scared every minute as I watched them. The shows/movies not only keep you in suspense, but make you wonder; did it really happen? (If you do not understand that last statement, you never watched the show/movie.) Mr. Dawidziak did a fantastic job of writing this book. Every angle is covered from the movies and shows. The stories behind the shows are very interesting. I have the 25th Anniversary tribute issue. There are interviews with the surviving cast plus photos, biographies, and an episode guide are only part of this compendium. Carl Kolchak is a character that will live forever, read this book and you will want to watch the series. And for those X-filers out there, you need this book: because it is the inspiration for the X-Files.<br /><br />It is funny; I have always loved the Night Stalker series and did not know this book existed. I flew to Seattle, Washington to tour the underground city I saw on the 2nd Movie, \\"The Night Strangler\\" and at the end of the tour in the gift shop was this book, hidden in the corner. They told me they use to make reference to the show during the tour, but for the last decade or so, no one knew what they were talking about. This came up because when they asked why we were on the tour, my friend told them I made him come on the tour because of the Series. (It is true) :-)	2002-10-21

This book is written to show us the beginings of the true Italian Crime family, of course they are Spanish. The Borgias are the essence of getting and keeping power for the family. I feel that the book was much longer than required. But this is probably to be expected, since Mr. puzzo was not able to finish his work. You can tell the author loved this period of time. He is trying to show us that Pope Alexander was not only the 1st Don but the greatest.    The book contains 4 main story lines and several secondary tales as well. The Borgia Pope and his 4 children take center stage, and the quest to unite Italy is the book's theme. The battles that span most of Italy and even the Island of Elba should read at the pace of military battles and the campaign they entail. This would be my favorite part, but the battles are mostly just briefly mentioned and this is most evident when Cesare conquers Elba in a matter of a few hours and a handful of pages in the book. Though I understand that this is not a Military history book.    Though not my favorite book, it is worth reading. Espically if interested in that period and to see just how corrupt the church was. I am glad that Carol Gino took on the task to complete this work.	2002-10-18

The endless cataloging of the undersea life and the operation of the submarine all come out of the autor's head.

This book covers the life of the Vampire Armand. Armands story touchs on all of the other books Vampires we have been introduced to in the previous 5 books. And intergrates them well. The book starts off strong and ends weak. You will not want to put this book down for the first two-thirds. I espically love the parts when we follows Armands life as a Vampire in Venice. And we follow him to Rome where we learn how he becomes the master of the Paris Coven. After this there is long jumps in history. Of course, it leaves us needing more books....for the story is obviously not over...	2002-03-26

The star of the book,is Victor a Bolo Mark XXXIII of the 4th Regiment, Second Brigade, First Confederation Mobile Army Corps, in the vanguard of an all-out Bolo strike against the planet Caern. The enemy is the Aetryx, shadowy, unknown beings who enslave other species with nothing less than the promise of immortality. As a savage interstellar war begins, Colonel Jon Streicher prepares to lead Victor and the rest of his reigment in a planetary invasion. But the landing falls into a trap. They find themselves stranded and desperately attempting to survive the hellfire chaos of modern warfare as Bolo faces Bolo-human hybrid in a cataclysmic showdown that will uncover unexpected truths, reveal hidden secrets, and even call into question the loyalty of the Dinochrome Brigade itself.  Should have only had the Bolo elements in this book.	2001-09-22

The star of the books, of course, are the Bolos. A self-aware robotic tank with a long distinguished history.  Some of the story lines move to fast, so as to not be developed to my taste.

The main character, the vampire, gets kidnapped and after escaping begins talking with a psychologist.

The book begins in Egypt in the 1920's with an archeologist on a dig south of Cario where they come across a great tomb and written upon it in three different languages dating thousands of years apart is a warning/curse that to disturb this tomb will wake it's occupents whose wrath cannot be contained. This is the resting places of &quot;Ramses the Damned&quot;. We learn that Ramses ingested an immortality elixir which he took from the Hittites. Having grown tired, he sleeps for 1000 years when Cleopatra awakes him. He, of course, is in love with her, as were all the great men of the time. He offers her immortality, but instead she opts for sucide instead of being taken as a prisoner to Rome. He awakes in London almost 2000 years later. Ramses exhibits human natures and qualities and falls in love. Though he is enjoying his lofe, Ramses feels that he must avenge the death of the man that found his tomb and he must say to Egypt before he can start a new life. But while in Egypt he finds the body of his one true love. Read the book to find out what happens. This book is not your normal mummy story. I would have rated it 5 stars; but the ending is a bit open, suggesting a sequel.	2001-08-05

A book with no romance in it, and thank God. For this book is funny and easy to read. Buy it; you will not be sorry. Much better than his last couple that were released.	2001-03-08

It shows the inside of a dirty political race (and trys to say this is how theyare all run). I am sorry to say it is probably so.<br />Not a very exciting read.

The author has a special gift for relating the insights of traditional Zen teaching stories in a refreshingly contemporary manner. I felt like I was actually at the retreats as I read the stories.

Questions range from the elementary of how long one should sit at a time to the more intensive of how to maintain concentration when not sitting. Omori Rotatishi was best able to convey his points by drawing upon his vigorous training as a martial artist of the samurai era and his scholarship in both Chinese and Japanese bringing to life the many traditional Zen teaching stories. <br />The book provides an introduction to the physical nature of training, discussing ones state of mind, the physiology, breath, posture, pain, and drowsiness. Training is placed in a context which gives sitting meditation depth and breadth. Sanzen Nyumon discusses the rationale for zazen, the foundation of Zen training. Zazen, while seemingly a simple activity, is not just &quot;quiet sitting&quot; and its value remains in fully understanding the subtleties of the activity. The book also provides instructions on how to sit zazen, and how to adjust one's breath, posture and mental state.	2000-12-03

I must admit that I was not greatly impressed by &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; when I noticed an increased tendency for Clancy to include more foul language than he had in earlier works. One thing I miss is his clean concise  writing and character action and development. I felt like I could read his books and enjoy their inherent complexities and character development without having to work my way through character after character swearing with and at each other. This book also delves into sexual encounters quite early. <br />I greatly enjoy Clancy's other books, but this book is a very bad read.

However,if you're looking for a book with some history and information, as well as an to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as well as learning about the various points and what happens when you hit them in the right manner, this book is for you. As it says, this covers the main 12 meridians, with volume 2 covering the remaining material.<br />It is fascinating how the points can be used for both damaging and healing purposes, all of which is covered (yes, even death points). This is a dangerous art which is not to be used lightly. Highly recommended reading if you're interested even the slightest in martial arts or TCM. This book is extremely useful. The details about the meridians are fantastic. There are a lots of photographs in vivid detail. each and every meridian is explained with set-up and antidote points. Healing details is what makes this book stand out. The location of points is described with a lot of medical terminology that a non-medical reader will struggle to actually locate the point.

The book is not her usually writting, instead of a serious serial killer story, expect a dark comedy. She takes a pot shot at  everybody and hits the nail on the head every time. The most important  lesson to be learned from this book is that there are too many people out  there hearing things that haven't been said and others who do not pay  attention at all. The narrative gets a little disjointed at times. But the  cast of characters are tied together in the end. On the serious side, there  is a teenage gang leader and the kids he scares into the gang.

Richard Burton was a historian, an explorer, and a fencer. His love of the sword is obvious as he follows it from its origins in prehistory to Roman  times. You can tell that Burton believed no detail too small when it comes  to the sword. He had a burning desire to tell what he knew, and this he did  with great detail. It is obvious that this was to be a multi-volume series.  Though written well....I was looking for information that would have been  in Volume II. Since the series will never be complete; the title should be  altered to include the time period reviewed. (With that done it would be 5  star, but I would have not bought it.)	2000-06-23

I first read Roshi Philip Kapleau book on the summer of 1980. I feel it is still one of the most informative books wriiten on Zen Buddhism. I am sure it must be considered a classic by now.

It is filled with good adivce and 1000 photos. The book is broken up into two main sections: Self-defense and sport karate. I found the self-defense section  to be very useful. In his so called sport karate section he shows kata and  two man routines per belt level.  Tegner looks stiff in these photos. I do  not recognize the style.	2000-06-17
