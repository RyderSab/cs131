The work's intent is to be \\"an Account of the Change in the Minds and Hearts of a Majority of the people in the Thirteen colonies\\" (ii).  Its narrative focuses heavily on the imperial policies of the British Government and the misunderstandings that permeated communications between the Colonies and the Mother Country.<br /><br />This learned work contains much that is useful to any serious scholar of the American Revolution.  There is a chronology of events followed by thirty-two chapters of narrative.  The book concludes with 27 appendices and over two hundred pages of notes and bibliographic entries.  The organization of the work is a cause of confusion, as the reader is required to skip back and forth between the main text and the back matter in order to keep the narrative flowing.  The exhaustive notes show that Knollenberg has consulted primary and secondary sources in both America and England.  They provide the reader will a clear guide for obtaining additional information.<br /><br />British and American relations had begun to decline during the period of the French and Indian war.  Imperial policy repeatedly provoked a sharp outcry from colonists and generated increasing bad will on both side.  The failure of the British government to recognize that the colonies were viable entities with their own goals meant that the imperial bond was irreparably damaged.<br /><br />Growth of the American Revolution: 1766-1775, offers a conventional perspective on the events leading up to the separation of America from England:  Imperial intransigence combined with economic divergence of interests.  For all its conventionality, it provides such a strong breadth of material and plain style as to make it a useful toolfor academics and an enjoyable narrative for general readers.	2005-04-13

Vaughan's book, Basic Skills for Christian Counselors, attempts to highlight the process, skills and strategies of counseling in a faith setting.  The target audience of the book is specifically pastoral ministers, which includes not just clergy but also other people counseling in Christian settings.  In most of these cases, the counselor has limited training and education.  A typical seminary education usually comprises just one or two classes in counseling techniques and psychology.  Some ministers may have additionally undergone a Clinical Pastoral Experience (CPE), which is a semester of supervised counseling.  These ministers are often preparing to become military or hospital chaplains, therefore expecting frequent demand for crisis counseling.  The demand for services in the average congregation may be as frequent, but there is generally less crisis intervention required.<br /><br />Pastoral counseling is distinguished from other types of counseling because there is an expected set of beliefs and values for the counselor that manifest in counseling.  The primary goal of this type of counseling is to help solve problems in a way that follows the teachings of the Bible, and in some cases church tradition.  Clients have usually selected pastoral counseling specifically because of this, and also assume that the counselor is: a person of faith, trustworthy, knowledgeable, and has some counseling experience.  Direct or indirect sharing of faith by the counselor is expected in the course of counseling.  Another contrast to most counseling is that pastoral counseling is aimed at dealing only with problems of normal psychology, as there is neither time nor training to dedicate to dealing with the complex problems generally associated with abnormal psychology.  Most clients of pastoral counseling are voluntary, which may or may not vary from other settings.<br /><br />Pastoral counseling adheres to the same privacy principles as other counseling disciplines,and it is distinct from other types of pastoral contact.  For example, a pastoral visit to a sick church member may show the concern of the congregation, but it is not counseling.  Additionally, conversations concerning matters of personal faith fall under spiritual direction, and are also not considered counseling.  A common problem for pastoral counselors is that they may be expected to give advice, which is no more the role of this type of counseling than any other.  For pastoral counselors, one of the important tasks in establishing a rapport with a client is gaining an accurate picture of an individual's faith walk in order to avoid failing to recognize a person's challenges.<br /><br />Vaughn breaks pastoral counseling into three basic orientations: the Expert, the Understanding Helper, and the Facilitating Problem Solver.  The Expert refers to the idea that the minister is seen as an expert on matters of religion and theology, which can shed light on the morality and values part of a problem.  However, this does not make the counselor an expert on another person's life choices, making this of important but cautious use.  The Understanding Helper is basically an empathetic person with a positive regard for the client, who provides a listening ear more than anything else.  Since a large portion of pastoral counseling deals with normal life transitions, which require no direct solution, the Understanding Helper is an important orientation to develop.  The Facilitating Problem Solver is utilizes a solution-focused approach to therapy, and would be equivalent to what most people would consider brief counseling methods.  Reframing problems well is especially useful for this orientation.<br /><br />Basic counseling skills such as empathy, listening skills, resistance, in the form of defense mechanisms, are all discussed.  Methods of problems solving that are essentially probing, challenging and reframing are also touched upon without elaboration of specific techniques.  Supportive measures, which simply means being empathetic through stressful life transitions, is given a good deal of attention because is forms the bulk of the work for a pastoral counselor.  The author briefly discussed when grief oversteps normal bounds and an individual requires a referral to another counselor, however no clearly applicable guidelines were set forth.<br /><br />Referrals and situations that require referrals were discussed at length, with a good deal of stress regarding the limitations of a minister as a counselor.  All counseling requests must first be weighed against the minister's schedule, in order to assure that the time required is available to commit to each individual.  Any obvious mental illness, signified by abnormal thinking, feeling and acting, must immediately be given a referral.  Other specific situation mentioned as warranting a referral include: individuals with extremely complex problems, such as obsessions or compulsions; severe depression; alcohol and drug abuse; and suicidal individuals.<br /><br />Choosing a professional to refer to is often a problem for pastoral counselors.  Specifically, the author discusses in depth whether the choice of psychologist or psychiatrist is appropriate based on the minister's assessment of the person's mental state.  The current reality of the situation is that insurance regulations likely dictate what type of help a person will receive.  The author stresses that in a referral to a professional, it is better to choose a therapist known to be competent and not religious, than one whose competency is in question.  A good therapist should be able to give consideration to a person's religious beliefs without it being necessary to hold the same beliefs.  Of paramount importance when making a referral is the attitude of the minister.  One should strike an attitude as if referring for any type of medical reason, as frequently the client of the minister has heard this advice from someone else previously and will not receive it well.  Often a pastor can refer a person without imposing a negative attitude toward the client simply because of schedule constraints.<br /><br />I would recommend it as an introduction for pastoral ministers or students, but otherwise I think its use would be limited.  It is not in depth enough on practical techniques to serve as a primary in preparation for pastoral counseling.  For students in an introductory class, most of the information would be found with the course's required text, and therefore of little practical value.	2005-03-31

Lippincott Company, published 1969<br /><br />Empire and Interest: The American Colonies and the Politics of Mercantilism traces the period from 1600 to 1800 in British history, focusing on how the power of special interest groups influenced policy and actions of the Government.  It is Kammen's thesis that these groups became so powerful during the middle of the 18th century that, \\"Men observed that mercantilism had changed from the control of trade in the interest of national policy to the control of national policy in the interest of trade\\" (pg 95).<br /><br />The author, Michael Kammen is also hoping to replace the interpretations of historian Sir Lewis Namier with a more updated approach.  Namier's work focused on the members of Parliament including the political parties they joined and the family ties they had motivation for policy.  To Namier all politics resolved down to local interests and that distinct and unchanging groups opposed each other.<br /><br />Kammen counters Namier's analysis with a more flexible view of the political spectrum.  Members of any particular interest often had many overlapping and intertwined connections with members of opposing interests.  The groups were more fluid than political parties or court factions and could form, dissolve and reform as political necessity required.  While individual groups might gain or lose influence, on the whole, special interests gained power throughout the period until the end of the American Revolution.<br /><br />Mercantilism as a political and economic system underwent many changes during the two centuries studied in the book.  Kammen does not attempt to confine the system with a strict definition but he does describe its main characteristics.  It was most readily seen as the pursuit of wealth for a nation by the regulation international trade.  Protectionism against imports, expansion of exports and colonial possessions used to support the home country.<br /><br />Stuart Monarchs before the Glorious Revolution were able to play each of the competing interests against each other with the skillful issuance of monopoly grants.  Equilibrium among the competing interests was established and maintained. After the Glorious Revolution the crown was unable to make such grants and the interest groups gained political influence during the general upheaval of the times.  British colonies in America realized the need to promote their cause with the home country and hired agents during this period.<br /><br />Britain's growing power abroad and its increasing national debt helped to increase the power of the mercantilist interests over those of the landed classes during the early part of the 18th century.  The needs of the treasury to finance the wars of the period combined with the bribes given by trading companies to Parliament were prime factors in this explosive growth of influence. It was this transformation of the entire society from a cohesive whole into a myriad of disparate groups all attempting to sway the government that inspired Adam Smith to write his work, The Wealth of Nations. Smith's work condemned the growing power of interests and their attempts to skew government policy. Mercantilist interests disregarded the needs of the American colonists and were a prime factor in the break between the two countries.  It was not until after the revolution that Britain's political system gained the needed stability to fend off the interest groups.<br /><br />Written in 1969, Kammen's work has begun to show its age.  Much of what might have been viewed as innovate in its time is now integrated into more recent scholarship.  Kammen's extensive bibliography is focused on secondary sources although some primary sources are listed.  This is in keeping with the author's goal to provide new interpretations on existing works and refute the theories of Namier.  This means that the bibliography provides a picture of scholarship as it existed thirty-five years ago but does not serve the current scholar as a basis for additional research.<br /><br />\\"Empire and Interest\\" is an interesting, but dated, view of the role played by British and American special interest groups in century before the American Revolution.  This book is primarily designed for an academic audience at the upper undergraduate level or above. Michael Kammen is a Professor of American History and Culture at Cornell University and the author of several works on the Colonial Period and the First British Empire including,  People of Paradox: An Inquiry Concerning the Origins of American Civilization, Colonial New York: A History, and A Rope of Sand: The Colonial Agents, British Politics, and the American Revolution	2005-03-30

Author Adam Hochschild, concentrates on the fifty-year period leading up to the eventual emancipation throughout the British possessions in 1838.  Hochschild's recent work King Leopold's Ghost also covered the topic of indigenous peoples oppressed by imperialist Europeans.<br /><br />Starting in 1787 the work covers the efforts of a group of 12 men and those they inspired to work towards the abolition of the Slave Trade.  During this time, Parliament was always a step behind popular opinion, which grew increasingly more anti-slavery with each passing year.  It was not until Parliament itself was reformed in the 1830s that the necessary legislation could be passed to reflect the sentiment of the nation.<br /><br />The book highlights many of the activists whose names have become footnotes to History.  Olaudah Equiano was a freed slave who worked all his life to better the plight of Africans.  His autobiography was a bestseller in its day and helped to spread the idea that Blacks could succeed as freemen.  Granville Sharp, a musician, used his vast family connections to keep the issue in the public eye for decades.  James Somerset sought his freedom in a landmark trial in 1772, which declared that all slaves were free once they came to England.  An Anglican minister, Thomas Clarkson, worked for decades with politician William Wilberforce to show the evils of the slave trade.<br /><br />Anti-Slavery activists created a public relations campaign that would seem right at home to the modern reader.  Buttons, pins, posters, book tour, and other PR techniques were employed to win over the minds of the population.  Clarkson developed a display of the shackles used by owners and toured through England and Scotland.  The `Middle Passage' route, which carried slaves to their new homes in the West Indies, was made infamous by diagrams showing the crowded holds and high death rates.<br /><br/>The struggle had many success and as many, or more, failures.  A model colony was set up in Africa to demonstrate the economic advantages to be gained by exploitation of the land and not the people.  The climate and soil proved inhospitable to the European crops and the local tribes were hostile to efforts that would damage their trade with the Europeans.  In the end, many of the colonists were reduced to working for the slave traders to avoid starvation.<br /><br />The French Revolution seemed to offer the promise of freedom to those in bondage in French colonies.  Many of the early supporters of the French Revolution felt it to be a decisive turning point in the Abolition movement.  Within a few years, however, French Slave ships sailed again with ironic names like \\"Fraternite\\", \\"Egalite\\", and \\"Liberte\\".  Napoleon's forces put down a slave revolt lead by Toussaint L'Ouverture but were forced eventually to withdraw his troops from the Island of St. Domingue.  The loss of the island was a factor influencing Napoleon to sell the Louisiana Territory to Thomas Jefferson.<br /><br />It was not until 1807 that the slave trade itself was banned by Parliament.  It took another thirty years of work by the abolitionist movement, as well as reform of the electorate, before slaves in the West Indies were freed.  By the time of emancipation, only one of the original twelve who started the movement was alive.<br /><br />Created as a popular history, Bury the Chains is well written and fascinating.  The general reader will find it to contain a good narrative filled with interesting events and memorable characters.  The academic user will find the lack of footnotes in the text dismaying but all quotes and sources are well documented at the end of the book.  The author uses both primary and secondary sources especially recent works such as journal articles and collections of primary documents.  This book tells a remarkable story and it tells it remarkably well.bly well.  <br />	2005-03-30

The arrival of the settlers brought disease and cultural upheaval both of which served to destabilize the equilibrium between the existing tribes.  The white setters were quick to employ their advantages and systematically deprive the Indians of their land and way of life.  By their actions, the whites lost the religious and moral imperative which had impelled them to immigrate to America and instead recreated a microcosm of the unequal society they had left.<br /><br />Each chapter in the work is titled with a contrast between the Indians and the English Settlers such as \\"Winners and Losers\\", \\"Hosts and Visitors\\", and \\"Farmers and Hunters\\".  This sets the tone for the narrative which compares and contrasts the natives with the new arrivals.  The author also attempts to present the complex relationships between tribes before the colonial period and how those relationships changed.<br /><br />Decimated by diseases brought over by early explorers, native tribes were unable to mount an effective resistance to the immigrants.  Declining population was more of a threat to the native culture than was the threat posed by the new immigrants.  In addition, the uneven effects of the illnesses were to destabilize the existing relationships between different tribes and shift the balance of power.  While the Pokanokets suffered greatly, the Narragansetts lost a smaller portion of their population.<br /><br />Tribal cultures had previously interacted within well-defined boundaries of respect and behavior.  While no tribe would `own' land it was understood that another tribe would have to provide tribute prior to using land that wastraditional used by another tribe. Sailsbury suggests that it was this cultural difference which caused the Indians to `sell' away land to the English settlers.<br /><br />For the Settlers, New England was primarily seen as an opportunity to create a new society away from the direct control of the Bishops and closer to Protestant ideals.  Instead, the desire for land and control had created a new class system in the America.  Nobles and Commoners were replaced with Christians (whites) and Heathens (natives). The rapacious settlers soon convinced themselves that they were doing God's work on Earth by their punishment of the Indians. Thus, \\"Despite the intentions and beliefs of many participants, then, the effect of colonization had not been to halt or reverse the processes forming in preindustrial England but to carry them across the Atlantic\\". (pg237)<br /><br />Manitou and Providence is an appealing, but heavy-handed, book.  The Author is willing to lay almost crime or bad intention at the feet of the English settlers while creating an idyllic view of the native tribes.  Too often, this interpretation overshadows the excellent narrative and informative facts presented.  The picture of interaction between the tribes as well and the fascinating discussion of the rise and fall of `wampum' in Indian culture are absorbing.  Readers of any level can enjoy this book as long as they are willing listen to the facts and make their own judgments. Extensive sources, mostly secondary, are listed in the endnotes but there is no bibliography.	2005-03-30

In death, as in life, his exploits are often overshadowed by more flamboyant seafarers such as Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins.  Martin Frobisher: Elizabethan Privateer attempts to rescue the captain from semi-obscurity and place his life in the context of its times.  The spotty documentation on much of Frobisher's life makes this no easy task but the author is able to fill in the gaps with dexterity.<br /><br />Frobisher was born in Yorkshire England in the mid 1530s.  After the death of his father in 1542, Frobisher was set to live with various relatives ending up at his maternal uncle's in London.  Sir John Yorke was a well-connected merchant who set Frobisher to sea most likely because he was a drain on Yorke's finances.  Frobisher fell out with his uncle after the latter failed to help him escape from captivity in Portuguese hands and soon struck out on his own.  By the 1560s Frobisher was well established as a privateer.  In this profession he often showed little regard for the legality of which ships were \\"good prizes\\" and which were not. He was called often in front of the admiralty court to answer charges of piracy.<br /><br />In 1576 Frobisher became the captain of an expedition to find the northwest passage from Europe to China.  This expedition failed in its goal but did spark a gold rush when a souvenir rock brought back was thought to contain gold.  Two more expeditions found no gold and nearly bankrupted many of the investors in the scheme.<br /><br />Frobisher's abilities as a captain earned him a place among Elizabeth's admirals during the Spanish Armada of 1588.  His command decisions during that time remain controversial to this day.  While some see Frobisher as an unskilled ship handler who needlessly put his ship in danger, the author is convinced that Frobisher was courageously placing his ship in harm's way tointerpose himself between the coast and the Spanish fleet.  Unlike other of Elizabeth's captains, Frobisher was never able to become a member of the Queen's inner circle.  He rose on merit alone and his star continued to wax even as other of the `sea dogs' watched their reputation falter.  Most of the famed sailors modern readers would view as his peers were disliked by Frobisher as much as he was disliked by them.<br /><br />After the Armada, Frobisher continued in her majesties services as a privateer.  He quickly returned to his former way of intercepting and plundering ships from both friend and foe.  Despite his greed, he was clever enough to understand that England's main interest was in destroying Spanish treasure even when it could not be captured.  In this view he was more willing to place public good above personal self-interest more than the Queen and members of the privy council. Frobisher's courage never deserted him; he was killed in 1594 leading a landing party on a Spanish fort.<br /><br />James McDermott has deftly accomplished a difficult task.  He has written a comprehensive portrait of an unlikable character without overly condemning him or attempting to redeem him.  Well researched and documented, Martin Frobisher: Elizabethan Privateer, is an informative and entertaining book well suited for academic and general reading.	2005-02-17

University of Wisconsin Professor of History Curtis Nettles wrote The Money Supply of the American Colonies Before 1720 in 1934.  It has since become a classic study of one of the major problems of England's first empire, reflecting both the depression era in which it was written and the early colonial period it explores.  Nettles contends that the economic goals of the colonies stood in direct opposition to those of the mother country and that these opposing views lead to irremediable tensions between the two.<br /><br />England established colonies to provide itself with economic advantages.  The colonies were to supply the mother country with unfinished raw material and would purchase finished goods from England.  There was no intention to promote growth of separate economically viable societies.  A deliberate policy was instituted to keep the colonies perpetually short of hard money in order to prevent the growth of a trading economy that would rival Britain's own interests.<br /><br />England's domestic currency supply was never adequate for its own needs during the seventeenth century.  The British money system was based on both gold and silver coins and improper valuation of the relationship between the two metals caused arbitrage to occur with silver coins melted down to bullion and then exported to Europe.  This continual drain of the treasury acted as a brake on the domestic economy and enhanced England's determination to prevent the exportation of currency to the colonies.<br /><br />During much of the seventeenth century, domestic turmoil, leading eventually to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, distracted England from strict enforcement of this policy.  Colonies in North America traded extensively with Spain to obtain gold and silver coins.  Pirates were all but welcomed in places such as Massachusetts in order to obtain the specie that had been plundered.  Through these extra-legal solutions, the colonies were able to provide themselves with some hard currency.  Unfortunately, most of the currency so obtained was soon remitted to England in payment for the goods purchased there.<br /><br />Later, England encouraged the use of \\"Bills of Exchange\\" among merchants and colonial officials appointed by the crown. Similar to a modern check, these bills allowed transactions to occur without the use of hard currency. They were backed only by the faith the creditor had in the debtor's eventual ability to repay the debt in hard currency.  Bills issued in the Government's name could take years to be redeemed making it difficult for Colonial Officials to find acceptance for the bills as time went on.<br /><br />Out of desperation, many colonies resorted to allowing payment of debts in \\"commodity currencies.\\"  A crop such as tobacco or wool would be given legal status to pay debts both public and private.  In addition to obvious problems such as spoilage and transportation, a host of other issues arose with such laws.  The transformation of any crop into currency meant that all the landowners would immediately produce more causing the value to drop.  Creditors would be repaid in a commodity with a fixed valuation by law and a lower valuation in the marketplace.  Taxes and debts were usually settled by means of the lowest quality crops leaving the owner free to sell higher quality items on the open market.  Crown officials would see their salaries drastically reduced by the expenses of taking a commodity crop in lieu of sterling payment.<br /><br />The Money Supply of the American Colonies Before 1720 is an indispensable guide to the problems of trade and currency faced by the early colonists in America.  It also provides a clear picture of the views held by the Crown during the same period.  This book is not exclusively a history book nor is it exclusively a book on economics; it is an excellent synthesis of both subjects.  Readers need to have a strong background in both subjects to get the maximum advantage from the work. It is recommended for the graduate level and above.<br /><br />The book is well-written, providing clear examples of every point made.  The author primarily relies on original sources and makes extensive use of Colonial Office documents and contemporary writings. On its publication the work was praised as being the first systematic study of the problems of specie in Britain colonies prior to the American Revolution.  Although written almost seventy-five years ago, Nettles' book has withstood the test of time and is deservedly regarded as a classic.	2005-02-17

Kenneth Andrews's book Ships, Money and Politics attempts to highlight the important role that maritime activities had in England during reign of Charles I in England.  The work covers a broad variety of naval subjects such as privateering, shipbuilding and King Charles' demand for \\"Ship Money\\".  While all of the topics relate to the sea, many have little in common with each other causing the book to seem disjointed.  Pervious works by the author include other books with an economic and nautical theme such as Trade, Plunder and Settlement Maritime Enterprise and the Genesis of the British Empire, 1480-1630 and The Spanish Caribbean: Trade and Plunder, 1530-1630.<br /><br />A series of fortunate occurrences helped the English shipping industry to grow during this period. New markets in America, the disorganization of Dutch Rivals, and changes in technology made shipping more vital than ever.  The new industry begat new men and in relaying this aspect the author is at his most compelling. The records left behind are sparse but Andrew's is able to present a very human picture of the people encountered there.  One chapter is devoted to the story of a ships' purser and his three voyages.<br /><br />The author has utilized many primary sources as well as a large collection of secondary sources.  The bibliography helpfully points out newer sources that were unavailable to the author as he wrote the book.  Several appendixes are provided with tabulated statistics of contemporary government information on ships, voyages and seamen.<br /><br />Ships, Money and Politics works well as an informative collection of essays on English seafaring in the opening days of the seventeenth century.  The topics do not have enough in common to provide a seamless unit but the common theme does shine through in each.  Andrews' work is easily accessible to upper level undergraduates and above.	2005-02-17

Bremer<br /><br />Oxford University Press, published 2003<br /><br />Millerstown University Professor Francis Bremmer's John Winthrop: America's Forgotten Founding Father is the first major work on the Massachusetts's governor in over fifty years.  It is an engaging and comprehensive volume serving as the author's attempt to provide a more balanced view of Winthrop than has been seen in other works.  Bremer writes, \\"The Winthrop of modern histories has been constructed to suit particular agendas.  It is time for biography that is interested primarily in John Winthrop himself.\\" (pg. xvi)  Bremer is well qualified to take on this task, as he is the editor of John Winthrop's papers for the Massachusetts' Historical Society.<br /><br />The narrative traces all of Winthrop's known ancestors in England.  Almost a century before John was born, his grandfather, Adam, was a successful London cloth merchant.  Adam profited handsomely from Henry VIII's reformation of the church.  He purchased monastery lands from the government and established the family's seat in Suffolk.  It was to this estate that Adam retired during the Catholic restoration of Mary I.  The Winthrops were staunch Protestants and the move was designed to prevent retribution from the Marian government.  The estate was to be the family's headquarters until John's departure for the new world in 1630.<br /><br />The family estate was located in the Stour Valley, which was a hotbed of reformed Protestantism.  Bremer deliberately avoids using the term Puritan because he feels that it carries to strong a connotation to the modern reader.  \\"Godly\\" was the description used most often by the Winthrop family and their circle.  Like many others in Suffolk, the Winthrop's were non-conformists to the Anglican model and hoped for continued reforms of the church.<br /><br />John Winthrop was born in 1588.  He attended college at Cambridge for two years and left without taking a degree.  While he considered entering the ministry, his early marriage and family obligation precluded that career path.  In 1605, he married for the first time.  From 1605 through 1630, John Winthrop lived the life of the minor gentry.  He was involved in running his estate, raising his family and practicing law. In 1615, his first wife died in childbirth and Winthrop soon remarried.  His new wife died a year later in childbirth; John married again in 1617 to his third wife, Margaret Tyndal.<br /><br />Winthrop became involved with the civil government when he was appointed to the Court of Wards and Liveries.  It was at this time he grew increasingly displeased with the corrupt state of the civil government.  After considering emigration to Ireland, he and Margaret decided instead to join with members of the Massachusetts Bay Company and move to the new world.  The venture was seen as a way to serve God and to make a profit.  The founders of the company decided on John Winthrop as Governor for the colony.  This is a reflection of the modest nature of the project in the eyes of the founders because, \\"if Massachusetts had been a larger, more important venture, he would not have been entrusted with the responsibility.\\" (pg. 170)<br /><br />As Governor, Winthrop was responsible for seeing the colonists through the bitter early years and for establishing order among the colonists.  It was at the start of the emigrating that his famous \\"Christian Charity\\" sermon was given.  He compared the colonists endeavors to a \\"city on a hill\\" that all could see. This biblical reference is Winthrop's most enduring literary legacy and is often quoted by politicians to this day.<br /><br />Winthrop strove to live a good Christian life and to ensure the others the opportunity to so as well.  He sought unity amongst the settlers but was willing to compromise and attempt to reach consensus.  He was unwavering, however, in his principles and showed no reluctance to expel Roger Williams or Anne Hutchinson from the colony when their unorthodox theologies threatened the stability of the society.<br /><br />Winthrop served as governor for 12 of the 19 years he lived in Massachusetts. He was untiring in his efforts to promote the growth of the colony.  In the winter of 1649, he became ill and died.  Bremer sums up the man and his accomplishments, \\"Zealous but not a zealot ... he helped to prevent his colony from being blown off course by the winds of extremism and from being wrecked on the rocks of fanaticism.\\" (pg. 385)<br /><br />Accessible to all levels of interested readers, John Winthrop: America's Forgotten Founding Father is a valuable portrait of an important figure in American History. Sources are extensive and meticulously documented.  They primarily come from the records of the Courts of Assistants in Massachusetts Bay, Official Records of the Governor and Winthrop's own papers and journals.  In addition, a host of sources from both sides of the Atlantic is employed in the work.  The in-depth coverage of the Winthrop family background can be tedious to readers only interested in American events, but they provide needed insights into the English Reformation and the events that lead to colonization of New England.  Bremer's work takes its place as the definitive biography of John Winthrop for the next fifty years.	2005-02-17

This book replaces the 1950 work Tudor England by S.T. Bindoff in the updated Penguin History of Britain series.  The volume is suited for use as an introductory college textbook providing a strong narrative of the period.<br /><br />Brigden's main goal is to show the Tudor period as one of transition between a series of 'old worlds' and outlooks as opposed to modern viewpoints and 'new worlds'.  During this highly eventful period, according to the author, the Protestant Reformation, the conversion of the nobility to one of personal service to the monarch and the exploration of new lands across the Atlantic all were new worlds.  The old worlds such as those of a strong independent feudal monarchy, the stability of the old religion and the certainty of an established landscape were all gone by the end of the period.<br /><br />The text primarily concentrates on a political narrative of the times; it is laden with facts and events.  Towards the start of the period, a chapter is spent on the social life of the common man and the social orders.  Near the end of the book, there are diversions from the political narrative to cover the beginnings of colonization in North America and events in Ireland. A concluding chapter showcases Shakespeare and the literature at the close of Elizabeth's reign.<br /><br />The book is both too much and too little to succeed in its goals.  While presenting a strong narrative and displaying a wide knowledge of the facts, the work is short on context and analysis.  Characters appear on the political stage with little introduction and the reader is left to his own devices to understand the motivations behind the actions.  Personalities are often pithily described but without any additional background.  Events are well chronicled but the need to cover so broad an area permits little depth.  One bright spot is the coverage of Ireland, much more in-depth than is usually found in a British overview of the period.<br /><br />New Worlds, Lost Worlds, leaves the reader understanding that there were many important events in during the Tudor years.  What motivated the people, and how the events related to one another is less well presented.  Readers who need to find out \\"Just the facts\\" will be very pleased with this book.	2005-01-20

Eric Hobsbawm concludes his series on the nineteenth century with The Age of Empire.  This sequel to The Age of Capital and The Age of Revolution covers the period from the mid 1870s until the outbreak of the First World War.<br /><br />This series is not a general survey of the period or a textbook.  Instead, it is intended by the author to be \\"an argument\\" for his basic premise.  This thesis is the unifying theme of the trilogy and, as stated in the book, it is: \\"The triumph of and transformation of capitalism in the historically specific forms of bourgeoisie society in its liberal version.\\" In this final volume the theme is the contradiction and instability of the bourgeois class when they were at their most successful.<br /><br />The paradoxes and conflicts were increasingly evident in the economy, society, natural sciences, politics and international relations.  Eventually they would crack the fabric of the comfortable bourgeois world with the start of the First World War. This conflict was the end of \\"the age of empire,\\" and the upheavals caused by the war (and subsequent peace settlement) shaped the world of the twentieth century.<br /><br />The very title of the work, \\"The Age of Empire,\\" shows that internationalism and colonialism are a central theme of the period. The elite nations of the world were able, it seemed at first glance, to spread their flags and their trade across the globe with impunity.  In a short span of time the Great Powers were able to conquer much of the less developed world.  To many, this seemed to prove the inherent justice of the imperialist cause. The confidence of the major powers increased with each new colony and triumph.<br /><br />Problematically, imperial powers found it easier to get an empire than to get a profit from it.  Even more unsettling was the fact that not all nations would be willing to give up their sovereignty.  The defeat of Italy by the Ethiopians, of Russia by Japan, and the long drawn-out Boer War all challenged the status quo.  The late nineteenth century was a time of mass politics.  Most of the industrialized nations of Europe had granted the franchise to a large portion of the male population.  This necessitated a change in tactics for governments even as their strategic goals remained much the same.<br /><br />A central paradox here was the use of mass politics to protect the rights and privileges of the elite few. Marxist theorists had expected that wider participation in the election processes would prove to energize the masses and serve as a precursor to the eventual revolution of the proletariat.  In this hope, the social revolutionaries would be disappointed.  Enlargement of the electorate proved to be a way to control the outbursts of the working classes that had previously lead to revolution or riots.  On the whole, the electorate proved to be more conservative and interested in slow, steady enhancement of rights and benefits than desirous of revolutionary change.<br /><br />In addition to economic and political change during the period, there were many social changes as well.  Women entered the workforce in large numbers in the newly developed jobs of office workers and nurses.  For the first time, primary education was available to almost all of a nation's citizens.  Education was not only a means to increase the productivity of the future workforce, it also was able to inculcate a sense of nationalism and national pride in the population.<br /><br />Hobsbawm ends the main body of the work with a review of the causes behind the First World War.  He quickly dismisses the notion of war guilt or concerns over the immediate causes of the conflict. Instead, the author looks at the whole of the period and the pressures which led to the outbreak of war when it did as opposed to any of the other numerous crises which had occurred in the preceding years. The author places much blame for those pressures on the capitalist system which had powered most of the nineteenth century:  \\"The development of capitalism inevitably pushed the world in the direction of state rivalry.\\"<br /><br />Hobsbawm is not able to be optimistic in his conclusions, but he does at least manage to be sanguine.  The plan so clearly and precisely mapped by Marx and his theories has not occurred according to schedule.  The author seems now unwilling to predict when or if it will.  As Hobsbawm himself writes, \\"The only certain thing about the future is that it will surprise even those who have seen furthest into it.\\"<br /><br />Hobsbawm's work is never without its supporters and detractors.  Reviewers of The Age of Empire reflect this pattern: in general, reviewers of the book were impressed with the scholarship and breadth of this ambitious book. Some reviewers were less concerned with the political beliefs of the author while others found them to be central to the work.<br /><br />The Age of Empire has many strong parts.  Hobsbawm is able to draw together events from around the world and relate them to his core thesis.  The argument that Hobsbawm tries to make is less enjoyable than the delightful breadth of the work.  One can sense the disappointment that the author has time and time again when the classes fail to revolt (as they should) or when capitalists fail to place profit above all else (as they must). The failure of history to proceed according to the wishes of the author is too intrusive to the reader and seriously detracts from the work.<br /><br />The Age of Empire is best enjoyed by a niche readership rather than a general one.  A reader with a strong interest in the social history of the nineteenth century will find this book an invaluable look into the period.  Others readers who simply hope to find out who shot whom in June 1914 are apt to be very disappointed.	2004-12-03

But the enjoyment in reading about the events of the time is diminished by a confusing narrative which jumps back and forth as well as the persistent theme of blaming everything on Anne.<br /><br />Both Anne and her sister were raised as Children of State.  Their upbringing was directed by Charles II and his ministers with the goal in mind of creating staunch Protestant heirs to the throne.  From their earliest childhood they were brought up to disdain the religion of their father and stepmother and with a firm belief in popish plots.  That in their adult years, they fulfilled this role shows them to be grateful Daughters of State more than ungrateful daughters to James.<br /><br />This book is worth reading for it's strong narrative of events surrounding the birth of James' son and its recounting of the events in the revolution itself.  However the reader must keep and open mind about some of the conclusions. \\"Ungrateful Daughters\\" chronicles the events and aftermath of the Glorious Revolution.  The bloodless coup that removed James II from the English throne and installed his Daughter Mary and her husband William as joint monarchs.  Maureen Waller, the author, writes not of high politics but rather tells the story of a family split by politics, religion, and perhaps even simple jealousy.  While the title references both daughters, it is the younger Anne, who Ms Waller sees that the prime villain of the piece.<br /><br />Maureen Waller's narrative of events is divided into three sections.  In the first third of the book, she provides biographies of each of the main participants in the family drama.  This is then followed with a narrative of the events surrounding the revolution itself and King James' escape to France to join up with his wife and infant son.  The last third of the book presents the reigns of Mary, William, and the last Stuart, Queen Anne.<br /><br />In an ironic twist the revolution's direct cause was the one thing all Kings strive for - the birth of a male heir. However, King James II was a Catholic king in a protestant country.  While many of his subjects we displeased with the favoritism shown by James in promoting Catholics to high office, they were content to bide their time and await the reign of his daughter.  When James announced that his young wife was pregnant, many Protestants began to see this a danger to the reformation and the country.  Rumors were spread that the pregnancy was a hoax; that James was planning to foist an unroyal infant on the nation, and that the infant was to be raised a catholic to prevent the monarchy from falling back into protestant hands.  To prevent this from happening, Protest nobles invited James' son-in-law, Prince William of Orange, to invade England in order to protect his wife's claim to the crown and to rule England in her name.  James' escape to France proved a convenient excuse for Parliament to declare that he had abdicated the Throne and then award it to his heir Mary and her husband.<br /><br />After the successful invasion, William became preoccupied with cementing his hold on the government and using English resources in his war against Louis XIV of France  The relation ship between the Queen and Anne soon deteriorated as they quarreled over Sarah Churchill.  After Mary's death from smallpox, Anne and William reconcile outwardly, but animosity remained throughout the rest of William's reign.<br /><br />Anne's reign began in 1702 following the death of her unpopular brother-in-law.  The premature death of Anne's son in 1701 meant that Anne would be the last Stuart monarch. It was a time of great success for Anne as England became the most powerful nation in the world thanks to its successful war against France ended in 1713; it was also a time of great sadness as Anne was to loose many of her former friends and favorites as she grew into the role of queen and attempted to implement her own policies.  Anne's death in 1714 was end of the Stuart line.  By the act of settlement in 1701 the throne passed to the Elector George Ludwig of Hanover.<br /><br />Maureen Waller's book might as easily have been called \\"Ungrateful Anne\\". The author places much responsibility for the Glorious Revolution on Anne.  Her position in the English court gave her greater access to information than her sister possessed.  Mary was frustrated at Anne's failure to be at the birth of the Prince James and her inability to provide more accurate and unbiased facts surrounding the birth.  It is Anne who always gets the role of bad apple.  Anne who kills one younger sibling with an accidental exposure to smallpox. Anne who refuses to give up her court favorites at her sister's request.  Anne who sends Mary nasty notes about their stepmother.<br /><br />Mary is portrayed as devoted to her husband William and interested in making sure that a changling is not allowed to usurp the crown.  James II is a doting father and Mary Beatrice is a loving, if naïve, stepmother who can't imagine how Anne or Mary would not be overjoyed at loosing her own place in the succession.<br /><br />The narrative structure of the first third of the book focuses on each of the participants in turn.  This means that a great deal of material is covered repeatedly.  To some extent this is useful as each time it is from a different perspective, however it comes off primarily as redundant since the author is advocating for her perspective against Anne in each of these sections.	2004-08-03

Each morning as Rubashov awakes he recalls his arrest and imprisonment many years ago for his revolutionary activity in the days before the revolution succeeded.  It is thus with a sense of irony and detachment that Rubashov faces his arrest one morning at the hands of his own party.<br />In prison, Rubashov waits his turn at interrogation and makes the acquaintance of the unseen prisoner in the cell next to him.  This unseen acquaintance is a army officer who has been arrested for his anti-revolutionary views and displays unrestrained glee that the revolutionaries are now turning on themselves.  Rubashov waits for his interrogation and reflects on his years of Party activity recalling the members of the Party whom he personally deposed.<br />Little Lowry was devoted to the Party and assured Rubashov that his local union would not unload shipments for fascist nations.  However, when the leader of the nation decided to trade with fascist countries, it became Rubashov's job to remove intransigent elements like Lowry.  Arlova served as Rubashov's secretary and lover but when she was wrongly denounced for factionalism, he did not speak to save her and in then end denounced her himself.  These actions were justified in his mind as being for the good of the Party and necessary to advance the revolution.<br />His first interrogation is conducted by an old party comrade, Ivanov, who treats him with firmness but also kindness.  Ivanov attempts to coerce a confession out of Rubashov but is unable to do so at their first meeting.  Later when Ivanov visits Rubashov in his cell, they have a long talk through the evening.  Here Rubashov continues to admit that he was not guilty of the crimes stated but admits that he had begun to have doubts about the revolution.  His interrogator then points out that he is guilty of being a counter-revolutionaryif his thoughts were not with the Party at all times.  Ivanov reminds Rubashov about Arlova and suggests that if Rubashov had doubted her guilt he should not have allowed her to be shot.  Rubashov begins to accept that he is guilty of crimes against the revolution simply by his doubts and that he must offer some form of confession.<br /><br />When he is next interrogated, Rubashov discovers that Ivanov has been himself purged and in his stead is Gletkin.  A product of the revolution Gletkin knows nothing of the older order and shows no compassion.  Rubashov is subjected to a series of interrogations at all hours of the day and night; he is deprived of sleep and unable to gather his thoughts.  It is with amazement that Rubashov notes the robotic stamina of Gletkin who being solely in charge of the interrogation must also be going for days without sleep.  While Rubashov is willing to write a confession and to stand trial for some counter-revolutionary thoughts, the Party has decided in advance the crimes for which he must plead guilty and written the confession for him.  For days, the old revolutionary and the product of the revolution battle over the semantics of the confession.  Eventually worn down by fatigue and confusion as to what the truth is, Rubashov gives in and signs the confession proffered to him.  This is his interrogator tells him, \\"will be the last service you can do for the Party.\\" Rubashov is then tried, convicted and shot.<br />Reflecting Koestler's own disenchantment with the Russian Revolution and the regime of Stalin, the novel attempts to show how the flawed ideals of the revolution have warped the basis of society.  In a society where the ends always justifies the means there are no ethical boundaries and truth exists only in relative terms.  This is exactly the kind of society that Rubashov helped to create and he is now the victim of the same ruthlessness that he himself practiced on so many others to advance the cause.  Over and over Rubashov tries to justify his own actions and to understand how these actions have brought his country and his revolution to the totalitarian state it is.<br /><br />The chief source conflict is not between the authorities and the prisoner but rather in the mind of Rubashov as he attempts to reconcile the socialist society he helped to usher into existence.  While a prisoner, the protagonist has time to reflect on the suffering he caused in a relentless pursuit towards his ideals.  The people discarded along the way are simply part of a mathematical calculation that is designed to bring the most happiness<br />Rubashov, throughout the novel, has the nervous habit of removing his pince-nez eyeglasses and rubbing them on his sleeve.  Repeatedly  during his interrogations or when he is lost in thought he attempts to clean the lens of the eyeglasses.  When Rubashov drops his glasses on the way to his execution, they fall to the floor and the lenses shatter. This leaves Rubashov  now \\"nearly blind, but he has solid ground under his feet again.\\" (214)  In this sustained metaphor Koestler shows the futility of Rubashov's attempts to justify and explain away the errors and excesses of the revolution and the leaders of the Party.  For all the protagonists efforts to clean his pince-nez he is still unable to see clearly.  For all his efforts to justify the inhumanity of the revolution he is unable to reconcile his doubts.  His vision like his party was flawed from the beginning and no amount of cleaning could put it right.  Only at the end of his life is he able to regain his footing with solid ground under his feet when he casts away the flawed vision of the Party.	2004-05-11

Artists began to break away from traditional concepts and to invent new ways to express themselves.

Rather they embraced the idea of being their own best works.<br />The institutions which had defined their society were in disarray.  The social order of the past, depended on a large population of rural farmers supporting an elite few in the urban centers, was being turned upside down.<br />Technology was causing great disruptions in the old order as well.  Events began to move faster and increasingly people began to be enslaved by the office clock and the factory whistle.  To many people, the simple solutions of the past offered by the church and the government and their local community no longer seemed relevant to the contemporary world.  Shattuck identifies four traits common to these artists<br />They all embraced childhood and a childish simplicity.  Jarry's most famous work was a play, Ubu Roi, begun in elementary school.  Satie wondered what kind of music a one-year old would create.  All four emulated the innocence and naivety found in childhood during their adulthood.<br />Another characteristic was a strong sense of humor and of the absurd in the work and lives of the avant-garde artists of the time.  Jarry and Apollionaire would each paint neckties on paper and wear the results to formal restaurants.  Satie would annotate his musical compositions with absurd instructions to the musician and dire warnings as to the consequences if the orders were disobeyed.  In their actions and their art we see them returning to the tradition of the court jester, able to speak the truth but only as a joke.<br />Thirdly, in questioning all that was traditional and real, these artists sought to create a dreamlike experience in the waking world.<br />Lastly, there was theme of ambiguity and equivocalness.  They spurned the notion that art could have only one correct interpretation even their own works.<br />Henri Rousseau retired from being a customs inspector to move to Paris and start life anew as an artist at the age of 40.  He was completely self-taught in his subject area and his work defied the style of his day.<br />Erik Satie was an innovative composer and musician who also served as a mentor for younger composers.  Satie's compositions are filled with non-traditional instruments such as rattles and typewriters and unusual names such as \\"vexations\\".  His eccentricities were well known among his contemporaries most notably that he never allowed anyone to visit the apartment where he lived the last quarter century of his life.<br />Alfred Jarry was a schoolboy when he got the inspiration for his greatest play.  A crude unpopular teacher was the butt of school yard pranks and the subject of underground student plays.  Later in Paris, Jarry would expand on those plays to create the character of Ubu a cruel and greedy man who plots to become King of Poland only to end up deposed and exiled to Paris.  Ubu was the character Jarry created to comment on the human condition. Ubu's insights into his own situation echo Jarry's insight into the world.  Jarry adopted much from his fictional character and over time he and Ubu become synonymous with the citizens of Paris.<br />Guillaume Apollionaire came to Paris at the age of twenty from Rome.  He quickly was able to make a mark for himself within the bohemian cliques and in caf&eacute; society.  Apollionaire was able to fund much of his literary work with his semi-pornographic novels.  He founded a literary magazine and served as a columnist and editor on other periodicals.  As a reviewer of modern arthe was able to bring artists such as Henri Rousseau to the attention of a wider audience. Sensitive to his position as a foreigner, Apollionaire sought naturalization and enlisted in the French Army during the World War.  He was wounded in the head and invalided out of the service in 1916 and died from the worldwide influenza epidemic in 1918.<br />The Banquet Years is by no means an easy read.  Readers who do not posses a working knowledge of Paris in this period or of the Avant-Garde artistic movement of the time will find it difficult to enjoy this comprehensive view of the period.  Places and names are often mentioned without any explanation that would assist in placing them in context.  While the book provides insights into the lives and works of some artists whose influence persists down to modern times, this is not an ideal introduction to the times, but rather is best appreciated by those who already have a basic understanding of the period and its theories of art and philosophy.<br />Placing the review and appreciation of the artist at the conclusion of the biography would make sense in a biography for more conventional figures.  However, these four attempted to direct their lives with the same inspiration that they did their art.  Thus it can be difficult to understand the facts of the live of Jarry without a guide to the work that so consumed him.  Shattuck possesses such an easy familiarity with the works of his subjects that he does occasionally forget to fill the reader in on the importance of the piece in question.<br />Shattuck has created a book which can be read on different levels by those with different interests.  Art, History, and Philosophy are all equally present in this work.  While it can be appreciated simply as a story of four remarkable men and four remarkable lives, to fully appreciate it, the reader must come to the book prepared to work hard for the insights it offers.	2004-04-21

It portrays mothers as sad victims of a society/media that has manipulated them into believing the idea that they are 100% responsible for everything that happens to their child.  There is certainly some truth to it, a stroll through Babies R Us can confirm the sales.  But the book<br />manages to offend anyone who's ever had a conservative thought,<br />and seems to ignore the idea that radical liberals and conservatives<br />are often in agreement on issues (ie homeschool.)  Most<br />hysterically, the book denies that there is any type of issue<br />between working mothers and stay-at-home, and that the media<br />itself has developed this myth.  There is a division, although it's not always so clear cut as this (SAHMs and moms who have taken jobs as opposed to careers flock together often, career types and SAHMs almost never.)  Her main point seems to be that instead of serving men, women are now serving their children.  I think she's right in many cases, but that her reasoning for it is flawed.	2004-04-16

For some Mahan's views were revolutionary and helped to create the reasoning behind America's entry onto the world stage.  Others view him as nothing more than the public relations man for an inevitable change, whose ideas were neither original nor particularly effective.<br />Writing first in 1947 with a revision in 1981, William E. Liveze in his book, Mahan on Sea Power finds a limited role for Mahan in the modern age.  In Livezey's view Mahan was primarily an apologist for the emerging age of imperialism, stating:<br /> &quot;Though Mahan was interested in and did affect foreign naval and imperial rivalry and did influence their strategic concepts, his primary concern was the indoctrination of his fellow country-men with the importance and significance of sea power for the United States.&quot;<br />That Mahan's career as a pundit began after the naval expansion program of the 1880s, means that Mahan was not an influence on the naval but simply provided, to the public, a justification for the actions already underway.  Liveze takes care to point out that what influence Mahan had was mostly overseas or with the public at large and not within the Navy itself.  Thus, credit for the resurgence of the United States Navy in the latter part of the nineteenth century must go to Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Tracy or to Mahan's mentor Admiral Stephen Luce.<br />Technology too, is seen as playing a role in rendering Mahan obsolete.  Livezey's book analyzes the role new technologies; especially &quot;submarines, airplanes, and nuclear energy&quot;  play in relation to Mahan's theories on naval warfare.  The advent of these changes have so outstripped the works of Mahan as to make him &quot;no longer the leading authority in current naval strategic thinking.&quot;<br />Livezey's ultimate judgment on Mahan is that what influence Mahan might be perceived to have had is because he &quot;wrote more cogently and persuasively and that his views gained a wider audience&quot;  than other naval historians had done before.  However, this does not mean that Mahan's views were original or timeless thus &quot;despite the prominence gained in his day, Mahan can scarcely be placed among the great historians; and despite the prestige accorded him, one cannot classify him as a great thinker.&quot;	2003-12-10

Some of the patients assert that they are innocent victims being held against their will. On top of that Teddy's own partner seems to know more of what is going on than he is willing to share.<br />Some have said that this was a shocking book with a surprise ending but I could see where it was heading fairly quickly.

Born as her father lay dying she became Queen before she was a week old.  During her infancy King Henry VIII of England raided the country several times in order to kidnap the girl and secure her as a bride for his son Edward.  She was sent to France by her Mother and raised as a daughter by the King.  At the age of 16 she married the heir to the French throne who became King shortly thereafter.  When her young husband died a year into his reign she was left a teenaged childless Queen Dowager.<br />She returned to the land of her birth to find herself a Catholic Queen in a country in the midst of Protestant Reformation.  Many of her protestant subjects feared that she would become a second 'Bloody Mary' and like her cousin Mary Tudor attempt to force her country back to the Catholic faith.  Plots and rebellions against her were a persistent occurrence.  Knowing herself to be in a weak position, needing to keep both her Catholic allies and her subjects contented, Mary set a policy of tolerance and moderation in religious matters.  Radicals on both sides of the religious spectrum found fault with Mary's tolerance of the religious diversity in Scotland.<br />Mary herself made matters worse by her disastrous romances.  She married her cousin Henry Darnley in the hopes of strengthening her claim to the English throne.  After only a few short months he began to plot against her in the hope of securing the throne of Scotland for himself.  He and other Scottish nobles murdered Mary's private secretary and friend David Rizzio as she watched, helpless to intervene.  When Mary was able to put down this rebellion he turned on his former allies and attempted unsuccessfully to reconcile with the Queen.  In the end his erstwhile allies disgusted at his betrayal murdered him as he lay ill at his home Kirk O' Field.  It is still debated how much Mary herself knew about the plans to murder her husband the Scottish king.<br />With Darnley out of the way the remaining Scottish lords were horrified when one of their own kidnapped Mary and became her third husband.  He was James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell was one of the leading suspects in the murder of Darnley.  Her marriage to him cost her the love of her people,  her tenuous friendship with her cousin Elizabeth I, and her catholic allies around Europe.  In one short month Mary was driven from the throne, forced to abdicate in favor of her infant son and placed in captivity by the Scottish lords.  Her husband escaped the country only to be taken prisoner in Denmark.  Bothwell would live another eleven years in a dungeon slowly going insane.<br />Mary was also able to escape from her prison,  the castle and Lochleven,  and she made her way to the English border.  Mary of Scotland was the last person whom Elizabeth would wish to see in her kingdom.  Viewed by many Catholics as the rightful Queen of England, Mary was a great danger to Elizabeth.  Mary became Elizabeth's \\"guest\\" and spent nineteen years in captivity in her cousin's country.  Since Mary was also the unacknowledged heir to the throne, her jailers were always cautious to treat her with the respect due to one so close to becomeing Queen of the land.<br />As the years passed the captive Mary became a romantic figure to many and was able to restore the reputation lost by her marriage to Bothwell.  In hopes of securing her freedom and of capturing Elizabeth's throne, Mary began to communicate clandestinely with English Catholics and her European allies.  Using her claim to the English throne as leverage, she began to look for a fourth husband who would free her, overthrow Elizabeth and rule at her side.  Eventually Elizabeth was forced to have Mary executed in 1587.<br />Her execution lead Phillip of Spain to launch the armada against England in 1588.  Mary was never able to sit on the throne of England as Queen. However, since 1603 all the monarchs of England have been her direct descendants.  She is buried in Westminster Abbey in London, acity she never saw while alive.	2003-10-08

FISH! is he story of a woman searching for a way to revitalize her workgroup and in the process save her job. The solution she finds comes from the unlikely place of the local fish market. By listening to the stories of one of the market's clerks our heroine is able to take back to her own problem four basic tenets for success. She meets her staff at the corporate &quot;toxic waste dump&quot; and is able to convert them to a person from a group of dispirited losers into the best team in the company.<br />The 112 pages of this book read very quickly and the ideas in the book are quicker still. They are basic and they certainly are sound ideas for motivating people. However, I think that the parable of Mary-Jane and her dysfunctional team was far too simplistic to stand up to real world application and that is a serious detriment to the book. Once the lead is converted she meets with her team who, after one negative comment, begin to embrace the ideas wholeheartedly. Where are the perpetual whiners ? Where are the &quot;We have always done it this way&quot; complaints. How about that perennial favorite &quot;It isn't our fault&quot; ? And best of all - The sullen non-complainers who will agree to anything to get the meeting over with but resist any real change ? I am not trying to be a spoil-sport here but these are serious obstacles to the kinds of change that this book tries to implement. I think that this book is either much too long to explain what the four ideas are (and they are good), or it is much too short to actually serve as any kind of an implementation tool.<br />It is also a poorly written story. Rather than as a parable of one woman's self discovery, I would much rather have seen it as a non-fiction management book with the story of Mary-Jane interjected as an example. As written it is not a good manual nor is it a helpful example.	2003-09-26

More than that however it is a haunting portrait of the entire generation that stood by. To me the most chilling portions of the book came not from Speer himself but rather from the many interviews the author conducts on her research. Time and again we hear from the many people, often high ranking, who had no idea that anything was amiss. The statements that these people make always concede how difficult life was for Jews, how Jews were denied their rights, denied their jobs, and eventually carted away `to the east'. Speer himself is a man willing to assume responsibility for the actions of the regime but who simultaneously seems to have no actions of his own to regret. We are allowed to look into his life and meet the many people in whom he inspired great feelings of loyalty. By and large this becomes a long list of people that the charming Mr. Speer uses and discards at his conven! ience. From his college friends to his assistants during the war years, to his own family during the spandau years. But never fear the book does have a happy end, after a few more betrayals Albert is able to look back on his life with the satisfaction of knowing how he single handedly dragged the war on for months beyond when it should have lasted.	2003-07-29

The narrow and petty viewpoint espoused by Truman and those advisors he trusted led to constant provocation of the Soviets and was a large factor in the division of Europe between Western democracies and Eastern satellites.<br />  Offner reviews the key moments of early post-war foreign policy and uses each to demonstrate how Truman and his advisers were unable to win the peace and instead locked the world into Cold War trench lines that became as immutable as those on the front lines of World War I. Offner believes that American intransigence played a major role in provoking the USSR to descend its Iron Curtain. Seen by many as a usurper to Franklin Roosevelt's mantle, Truman was in no position to implement the decisions of Yalta or forge a new policy for the post-war world.<br />  Offner contends that Truman's decisions from the beginning were confrontational rather than cooperative. The author presents Truman's initial meeting with Russian Foreign Minster Molotov and shows how the president dresses down the envoy and enjoins him to \\"keep his promises.\\" It is with this attitude that Truman attends the Postdam Conference in July 1945<br />  The ultimate disposition of Europe is a key area for Offner's analysis. The division of Europe that came in the post-war days was not the inevitable outgrowth of Stalinist greed, to Offner, but was rather the natural and expected reaction of a war-weary Russia that felt itself being once again encircled by hostile forces.  The introduction of the Marshall Plan was viewed by the USSR as an attempt on the part of  America to purchase Europe at cut-rates.<br /> When the Western Powers announce a plan to rearm their sectors in Germany it is countered by a Soviet proposal to create a unified but unarmed and neutral county. The eventual separation of Germany into the Western Easternhalves is the result of years of increasing tension and the desire by the United States and Britain to re-arm their erstwhile enemy as a bulwark against the communists to the East.<br /> By 1947 Truman was confident enough to promulgate his own policy and abandon the façade of the wartime alliance which had all but disintegrated. The Truman Doctrine was the central policy for the rest of the president's time in office. It stated a willingness to fight against communism anywhere it attempts to overthrow a non-communist government. It made no distinction between \\"outside pressure\\" as opposed to \\"armed minorities,\\" thus linking internal revolutions with the perceived threat of the USSR and its attempts at world conquest.<br />  Offner comes closest to proving his thesis when he discusses the disastrous events in Asia. Inheriting support for Chang Kai-Shek and his GMD from Franklin Roosevelt, Truman was boxed in by his own policies. Even sending over General Marshall as a mediator between Chang and Mao was pre-ordained to fail as long as the American government simultaneously supplied materiel to the GMD during the negotiations. The failure of the Americans to recognize the People Republic of China caused Mao to turn to the USSR for assistance creating, at least temporarily, the self-fulfilling prophecy of \\"Monolithic Communism.\\"<br />  The fear that China was the first of the Asian dominoes to fall caused Truman to misperceive the North Korean attack on South Korea as another attempt by the Soviets to expand their empire. The Truman Doctrine meant this could not be allowed to succeed. Korea quickly became a quagmire with three years of fighting and thousands of American deaths all to re-establish the status quo. Much of the delay was caused by Truman's refusal to return POWs on an \\"all for all\\" basis. Instead, he attempted to prevent any POW from being involuntarily returned to his home nation. This was in fact contrary to the custom of war and the most recent GenevaConvention. While Truman's reluctance in part came from the poor treatment the USSR had given to repatriated POWs from World War II, it was small comfort to those who fought and died while this point was debated.<br /><br />  Another Such Victory is a well-written overview of the key issues in foreign policy faced by Truman. Each chapter contains an introduction summarizing the events to be presented a content section with details of the events and decisions, and a summary/conclusion section to review the chapter. The tendency to use the same quote over and over again throughout the chapter can go beyond adding emphasis and lead instead occasionally to a feeling of repetitiveness on the author's part.<br />  Offner gives short shrift to the domestic politics and attitudes that prevailed during the Truman years. Though the book centers on foreign policy, the Truman presidency did not exist in a vacuum and domestic pressures played a large role in the ongoing development of policy abroad. Certainly throughout this period the red-baiting of Joseph McCarthy, the passage (over Truman's veto) of the MaCarran Act, and the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee were  forces to be considered in any decision involving Communism.<br /><br />  Offner has the advantage of time and perspective as he judges the actions that Truman took sixty years ago. However, lost in the distance of time is the context of the period in which these decisions were made. Munich may have become a tired analogy by the 1990s, but Truman was living with the results of Chamberlain's appeasement less than a decade after it happened.<br /><br />  Offner has the temporal advantage of sixty years and the editorial advantage of choosing what material he will include to develop his viewpoint, both of which he uses liberally. It is true that mistakes were made, but Another Such Victory falls short of a convincing condemnation of Truman for provoking the Cold War.	2003-07-21

Everyday from the elastic bands in the office to the tires on planes and automobiles, rubber keeps the world moving and together.  The story of how it went from an impractical curiosity to a modern marvel of science is the subject of this fascinating story.<br />Charles Goodyear was a failed businessman with a determination to wrest from India-gum rubber the secret of the age.  How to prepare the substance so it could withstand the extremes of heat and cold.  Without this knowledge all rubber products were doomed to a short life span and an ignominious end as a sticky glob or a frozen and brittle pile of scraps.  Goodyear sacrifices all the comforts he has; he begs and borrows shamelessly from his friend and family.  He is thrown into debtor's prison more than once.  His family sickens from lack of heat and proper nutrition.  Against all the odds, the crackpot genius does discover the long sought process and then his REAL troubles start.<br />If Charles Goodyear thought that no one wants to be your friend when you are unsuccessful, his list of enemies Is nothing compared to when he has success in his grasp.  Out of the woodwork come charlatans and crooks all ready willing and able to steal the victory laurels from their rightful owner.<br />This is the kind of story that fill the headlines today and makes us all lament about hoe much better things were in the `old days'.  The more things change they more they stay the same.	2002-12-01

The war to end all wars is over and everyone in Annie's hometown is planning a rapid return to normalcy.  But things are far from normal in Annie's family.  Her father has been away for over a year working as an Army Doctor in a hospital in New York City.  Her Uncle Paul died in France a year before the end of the war, and the sadness of his death has cast a long shadow over all her relatives.<br />After her father returns, things start to change even more.  The doctor decides to take a new job at a catholic hospital and assist in the care and rehabilitation of some of the more severely wounded soldiers from the war.  These disfigured young men are a painful reminder to the townspeople who prefer to think only of the heroic dead and the handsome young veterans.  When Annie befriends a wounded man many of her friends and family find it hard to accept.  Annie is forced to make painful choices and decided what is the right thing to do.<br />I was not overly impressed with this book. I though it moved very slowly. Many of Annie's friends and schoolmates were two-dimensional.  Some themes, like the anti-Catholic feeling of the town were introduced but then never resolved.  This was an adequate book but not the kind I would read again or recommend highly.	2002-11-28

Those who do not learn their history are doomed to repeat it, but those who learn it badly are doomed to write books about it.<br />Elizabeth I is an amazing figure on the historical stage. She took a confused country and made a great nation out of it. Her guidance and tolerance in religious matters made her one of the greatest monarchs of all times. She was a woman on the throne at a time when most women could not hope to have their opinions taken seriously. In times of crisis she rallied her armies to defend the nation she ruled and despite much religious strife she earned the loyalty of both her protestant and catholic subjects.<br />Alan Axelrod makes an attempt to carry forward her leadership secrets into wisdom we can all use today.  Sadly, he seems to have written the book first and then filled in the blanks about the history.  Each chapter Axelrod gives a quick overview of the topic to be covered and then gives the \\"leadership secret\\"  followed by an anecdote to illustrate the point.<br />A fictitious example would be :<br />\\" 108 Eat Your Veggies\\"<br />\\"As  Queen of England, Elizabeth often received letters from Mary Queen of Scots, saying how much she hated broccoli.  In the end Elizabeth had Mary's head chopped off and the letters stopped.\\"<br />Sounds good? Well in practice it falls flat.  First problem was that there seems to not be enough secrets to go around so they repeat.  Topics like `loyalty', `gratitude', `remember others', and 'be thankful' are all very much the same as Axelrod presents them and don't bear the amount of repetition that he gives them.  Each time there is another anecdote but their aim is all the same.<br />Another sticking point I, of course, the fact that some of the history is inconvenient and so has to be worked around.  There is a point about avoiding playing favorites illustrated with Elizabeth having to execute her erstwhile favorite the earl of essex and how she learned the error of her ways and never did it again.  In fact the reign of Elizabeth I is littered with her playing favorites most notably Robert Dudley.  The blatant favor she showed him was a major factor in destabilizing her privy council on more than one occasion.<br />The lesson on taking responsibility likewise falls flat.  One example not given is how Elizabeth signed the death warrant for her cousin Mary Queen of  Scots and the repudiated it as soon as she was executed.  She threw some of her loyal servants in the tower for following her orders and wrote to all the European Monarchs to deny her responsibility.  I wonder how that one never made it into the book.<br />Many other facts of her reign are likewise skipped when they prove to be contrary to the author's intention.  Her life and times were filled with many issues and problems unlike modern day. While there are many insights that can be gleaned from her life, they are not well presented in this book.<br />There are a lot of great books on leadership in the market and lot of great books on history.  This one is neither.	2002-11-25

Did you know that American's use more than their fair share of the world's resources?  That the eat an unhealthy diet?  That they drive big gas-guzzling cars?  Oh you did?  Well, then you might be able to skip this 270-page tome on the evils of the modern world.<br />The cover was striking, the book jacket promised more about the ills of the modern wold than I could dream of finding.  But the book seemed to ramble on without providing much in the way of help for us to break the shackles of the dreaded affluenza and move up to the next level of enlightenment.<br />I found the name affluenza and the idea of it being a `disease' was cute.  At First.  That wore out pretty quick for me though.  But not for the authors who carry the pun until the dreaded device is as fun as nails on a blackboard.<br />The book had topics that spoke about people who quit or were laid off from high-paying jobs and suddenly found happiness when they made 1/3 or their old salary. It spoke of the joys that people who never spend more that 8,000 year had in comparison to corporate CEO's.  The book stops well short of explaining how we can do this in our own lives other than recommending websites and additional books to buy.<br />I just didn't come away from this book with any great compelling `must have' knowledge that I think will change the world.  I know that an SUV takes more gas than a Honda Civic.  I know that there is a wide disparity between the rich and the poor and that it is only getting wider.  I think that most people who would be tempted to read this book know that too.<br />I suppose that this was what I disliked about the book.  There was a mish-mashed collection of facts without any hope or plan to alleviate the problem. There was too much clowning around for the book to be a warning of things to come and way too little advice for it to be useful in my daily life.	2002-11-25

A thread across the ocean is the story of one man with a dream and the Herculean efforts it took to make the Atlantic Ocean and the English-speaking peoples it divides a `pond'.  Laying the transatlantic cable for the first telegraph communications from Europe to North America was an epic feat and one that deserve to be told.<br />We take for granted the fact that when the Queen Mother dies or the stock market in Germany drops that Americas with TVs on will known sooner than Europeans who have the set off.  We take it so much for granted the seeming necessity of the global communications that it is hard to believe how few people embraced this idea after the invention of the telegraph. It was the vision of one man to span the ocean and it took him twelve years to do it.<br />Short on technical details and long on profiles of the men involved in the project; this is a book for those who enjoy history more than those who enjoy technology. But both groups will come away with respect for those who dreamed big dreams and made them realities.	2002-11-25

This light and breezy tome about the author's time at Amazon.com works best when he tells funny anecdotes about his job and his life.  This self-described dilettante seems to never take too much too seriously.  Working his first `real' job in a company that is THE model for the dot com industry, Daisey has a ringside seat in the new economy.<br />It is only a few years ago now but so many of the ideas and ideals that held the early Amazon.com together look quaint and old-fashioned.  Daisey doesn't spare himself how he talks about people working towards getting the product out the door as losses mount and stock options grow. The old adage of `sell at a loss and make it up in volume' seems to have been invented for firms like Amazon.com, Pets.com In the enthusiasm of the moment they all bought into the dream of riches flowing from the red ink.<br />The author was never close to the heart of the company and his tenure there was brief indeed but while it lasted it was intense.  As much as Daisey loved the place and the idea of working with internet icon `Jeff Bezos' he freely admits that his work was not going to get him to the top of the corporate ladder. He hangs up on the clients when he answers the phone, he accepts products to review and then skips the reviews, and the pinnacle of his time with the firm is days spent looking for porn websites that link to Amazon.  Why the magic failed to stay with him for long is not a tough question to answer.<br />Daisey tells a great story and many anecdotes are side splitting.  His diagnosing the failure behind so many of the early dot coms is less insightful and filled with the same commonsense that the rest of the world woke up to a couple of years back.  The fictional letters he keeps writing to Jeff Bezos but never sends could be entirely dispensed with and the book would be funnier for it.<br />High marks for humor but lower scores for any insights into the world of the internet economy.	2002-11-25

It is an interesting tale about life in a gilded age now gone.<br />More than just the logistics of Steven Lewis' life were uniqe.  He was more than just a kid hanging around the hotel.  He was the Crown Prince of place as well.  The most telling parts of the book reveal how he came to understand the borrowed athority he possesed or how even a child he could make the adults nervous.  When a strike at the hotel pits managment and staff against each other you see the conflicting loyalites of the author.

Ok Storytelling	Bob Greene discovered a story of WWII known to many, but fading from living memeory.  It is the story of a community that banded together to provide a little bit of home to six million soliders as they traveresed the country.  Each officer and man was a part of the family for the ten minutes that it took to refuel a train in a remote spot in Nebraska.  Now the soliders and their hosts are part of a passing generation.  This book makes sure their deeds will never be forgotten.<br />I loved the stories in this book and wish that Bob Greene had found the space to add in a few more.  That each of these soliders passed through a little train  depot for 10 or 20 minutes and recalled it vividly 60 years later stands as a better monument than any of the townspeople could have dreamed of.  The stories of those women and girls who created the canteen proves the adage 'They also serve those who only stand and wait'.<br />Bob Greene weaves the story of the contemporary town into the narrative for each chapter and this was done perhaps to excess.  The rise and fall of this one small town in the middle of the country might seem as typical any other but really this book is about the men and women of the 1940s and how they gave hope to six million of their boys in a time that seemed almost hopless.  That was the story I will carry with me.	2002-11-17

(Not really)	Not for the first time in a century and a quarter the case of Jack the Ripper has finally been solved.  Sadly, for Patricia Cornwell, this won't be the last time is if finally solved either.  Famous for her \\"Kay Scarpetta\\" mysteries author Cornwall throws in lot of money and adds her gripping narrative talent towards proving that the ripper is an artist and dilettante.  Her main proof is that he might have written some letters to newspapers claiming to be the infamous Jack.<br />Truth may be stranger than fiction but the annoying part is that it also has to be true.  The definitive evidence Cornwell and her crack team find when they examine 100 year old evidence is far from conclusive in most people's opinions.  However, most people do not have the kind of money invested in the case that she has, so her bias might be a little strong towards belief<br />than doubt. Cornwell writes a good story and sets the stage well for London during those horrific months of terror and years of wondering, but her insistence on solving the case definitively takes away a lot of the fun that might otherwise be had.<br />High Marks for enthusiasim.

However I also thought that it could have been better.  I do not regret reading it and I would suggest that others might enjoy it as well<br />Barbara Ehrenreich went abandoned her upper class lifestyle and spent a few months moving around the country looking for unskilled work.  She attempted to show how tough it can be to get by on the low but seemingly livable wages that many Americans earn.  In each of three cities the author tries to find housing, employment, and a stable life.  In each of three cities she is forced to admit that it takes more than she has to get by.  Along the way we are treated to amusing and sometimes tragic anecdotes about her fellow wage-slaves.<br />While an exploration of the working class plight is a great idea it might have more sense to have explored it from the residents themselves rather than as a tourist who brings her own views and judgements in to the story.  Also the fact that Ehrenreich stayed so briefly in each place meant that she wasn't really able to get a good picture of the day in and day out grinding level of despair that grows as one is unable to maintain a space in or join the middle class.  The author does talk to her co-workers and presents their stories as well as her own.  However, these are only small vignettes and fail to provide a real look at the lives of the working poor.<br />With the advent of cars and the suburbs all too often people from one socio-economic group are isolated from the others.  Cars and trailer parks allow the downwardly mobile to be bussed in and out at the convenience of the more fortunate when they need a lawn trimmed or a house cleaned.  I applaud the attempt of this book but wish it could have had more participation from the people who live that life as opposed to those who just benefit from it.	2002-06-28

This is a nifty idea that was badly written in the play and comes of as a theatrical trick more than as a telling reminder of the stability of human nature.  The fact that one character actually knows the people from both eras and often talks to the past while in the present is even more annoying.  Sometime the people from the present respond as if they were in the past and some times they just seem confused themselves.<br />All in all I read the pay but I would not suggest that anyone else do the same.	2002-05-22

Told with deadpan humor, Suzy Parker relates the story of her life after her husband's near-fatal bike accident.  While it is Ralph's accident that is the catalyst for the change in their lives, this is the story of Susan Parker.<br />After the accident, the plans for an athletic retirement are replaced with endless trips to doctors, pharmacies, and the never-ending routine of caring for a quadriplegic.  Many of their old friends offer advice but not much else, other fade away entirely.  As the family being to sink into despair, new friends and associates come to help her adjust to the new lifestyle.  Susan freely admits that many of these people are not the type of people she has ever known much about before nor would she have ever chosen to associate with had she not left the privileged world of the white upper-classes.<br />I found this book to be full of funny anecdotes that were well told.  Ms. Parker tells her story with as much humor as possible and a great deal of candor. It is a quick read and well worth your time.	2002-05-21

Interesting but not definitive.<br />It was a marriage of convenience that had turned inconvenient for someone. In 1875, Florence Ricardo married Charles Bravo.  He was after her money and she was seeking to cleanse her name after a lurid sex scandal by marrying respectably.  After less than six months of married life he was dead and a cloud of suspicion hung over his wife and the servants of her home.<br />A Coroner's inquest determined that the death was murder by poisoning.  But it was never able to solve who had committed the crime.  The chief suspects were: The widow who resented his attempt to control her money, the groom who had been fired by the new master of the house, the lady's maid who was next line for dismissal, or the elderly doctor who was Florence's ex-lover embittered about her marriage.<br />This unsolved Victorian mystery has been the subject of numerous speculations for over a century. Investigative reporter James Ruddick feels that he has finally cracked the case with damming new evidence.  He goes beyond the source material used by many authors and travels the world over to contact descendants of the infamous participants in the original mystery.  He weaves together a narrative that he feels is the definitive solution to the case.<br />This book is, in my opinion, a little too concerned with showing off the intrepid exploits of the author than it is with reasoning out the evidence. While his solution is very plausible this book is by no means going to be the final word on the case.	2002-02-19

FISH! is he story of a woman searching for a way to revitalize her workgroup and in the process save her job.  The solution she finds comes from the unlikely place of the local fish market.  By listening to the stories of one of the market's clerks our heroine is able to take back to her own problem four basic tenets for success.  She meets her staff at the corporate \\"toxic waste dump\\" and is able to convert them to a person from a group of dispirited losers into the best team in the company. <br />The 112 pages of this book read very quickly and the ideas in the book are quicker still.    They are basic and they certainly are sound ideas for motivating people.  However, I think that the parable of Mary-Jane and her dysfunctional team was far too simplistic to stand up to real world application and that is a serious detriment to the book.  Once the lead is converted she meets with her team who, after one negative comment, begin to embrace the ideas wholeheartedly.   Where are the perpetual whiners ?  Where are the \\"We have always done it this way\\" complaints.  How about that perennial favorite \\"It isn't our fault\\" ?  And best of all - The sullen non-complainers who will agree to anything to get the meeting over with but resist any real change ? I am not trying to be a spoil-sport here but these are serious obstacles to the kinds of change that this book tries to implement.  I think that this book is either much too long to explain what the four ideas are (and they are good), or it is much too short to actually serve as any kind of an implementation tool.  <br />It is also a poorly written story.  Rather than as a parable of one woman's self discovery, I would much rather have seen it as a non-fiction management book with the story of Mary-Jane interjected as an example.    As written it is not a good manual nor is it a helpful example.	2002-02-12

The reaction to this observation was the ruination of her career, and the beginning of his status as a pariah among most newsmen.  This book is used to add more ammo to the controversy.<br />That the journalists who so eagerly pry into other peoples lives and business should be reluctant to be examined is hardly surprising.  Almost no one really wants to have his life or business dissected by Mike Wallace not even Dan Rather.  Some facts in this book are really potent such as the survey results which show how the average journalist and the average American are often vastly at odds.  Other chapters highlight different stories that TV news has covered and the analysis that Goldberg has made to point out the liberal bias.  His main theme is that while there is no conspiracy of the left, the fact is that most reporters are liberal but fewer still will admit it.<br />There is some sound reasoning behind this book.  Sadly in execution, it doesn't come off as well as it could.  Goldberg has one argument in all the years he worked closely with Dan Rather (according to him) and yet it seems like all they did was fight.  Why ?  because Goldberg replays that one argument about 5 or 6 times in the book.  Much of the material that is thought provoking the first time around is pretty stale after the third or fourth reading. He kindly reprints the editorial that started the whole furor, too bad this was at the end of the book because the entire first chapter is just a rehash of that argument.  Too often Goldberg is reduced sounding like the bitter vindictive person he claims not to be.  Sarcasm and snide remarks permeate the book often serving to distract from the valid points it has to offer.<br />Bernard Goldberg's years as an insider give him a valuable perspective about the current media climate, however this book is more of a dull whine than a clarion call.  I look forward to seeing more on this subject from such a well informed insider as Mr. Goldberg after he has finished venting his anger.	2002-02-05

I saw this book in the library and picked it up for a quick read that would remind me, as the cover states, of  \\"12 angry men\\".  That isn't exactly what I got. But, I'll be honest and say that I liked this book a great deal more than most of the readers seem to have (and I didn't have to buy it).<br />  I did fined the author both silly and condescending. He used his power and position as Forman to harangue the jury until he got his verdict.  He tells of his fellow-jurors and their lower mental abilities.  He is exasperated that people can still have an opinion different from his even after he explains the truth to them, He speaks openly of how he tries to get the jury to hang and how he initially saw his role as prolonging the talking and thinking.  Hoping never to reach a verdict but simply to keep the talking going on forever and ever.  However he seems to find that the time for talking ends just about the time that he is running out of his own private stash of vegetarian food.  This plays a large part in the book but really it isn't surprising since most people who are forced to be somewhere (prison, college, the hospital) seem to get a little obsessive on the subject of meals.<br />Burnett tries to present, to the members of the jury, and impassive and impartial façade.  Or so he thinks.  He admits to stopping conversations that he feels are leading towards a conviction, he prepares a statement to be read in court to make sure that the judge understands the jury's (i.e. Burnett's) view on Law as opposed to Justice, and he gives a long lecture on the same subject to the rest of the jury under the guise of deliberations.<br />In his book Burnett admits that he knows little about the subject of jurisprudence and that some of the facts were fudged.  But it was OK as he was trying to make a point.  How nice.  Nothing likes throwing around your weight as an academic and then making it all up (this reminded me of the Professor on \\"Gilligan's Island\\").<br />Now then how could I like the book? Because this is real and this is how things really can and do happen.  This was a jury this was a case and this was a verdict.  People are fooling themselves if they think that each of the 11 other members of the jury were not just as self-absorbed as the author in some way or another.  I can't get 12 people in a room for an hour to agree on where to call for take-out lunch four days in a jury would kill most people I know.  This book was not a pretty picture of how justice is given or denied, but that does not mean it is inaccurate.	2002-01-29

I thought it had a lot of information well presented but also found it to be less than perfect.<br />\\"Farewell in Splendor\\" is an interesting and readable account of the last week in the life of Queen Victoria and her funeral.  When an old woman has nine children and forty grandchildren, it is easy to see that there is bound to be confusion and differences of opinion about her care.  However when that woman is also the Empress of the largest empire on earth. The difficulties seem to multiply for each of her subjects.  This is the case in 1901 as Victoria, the doyen of Royalty, finally fades after a record breaking sixty-four years on the throne.<br />Jerrold M. Packard has written two books on the subject of Victoria and her family.  I found that much of the background material in this book was a reprieve of  \\"Victoria's Daughters\\".  Since any book about the death of Victoria is bound to have a limited audience, much of the background material seemed to be out of place in a book devoted mostly to a three-week period.  I think that people willing to read about Victoria's death might already know something about her life.<br /><br />From the book, I get have a strong impression that Packard simply does not like Queen Victoria and saw her only as a mean and selfish old woman.  I'll grant you that in many ways she was, but in this book so many of her more endearing traits are omitted.  It draws a rather one-sided picture of Victoria and not the most flattering side.  I think that a little more balance would have served this book well.<br /> I like that fact that the book was easily readable and had many interesting facts to present.  His parenthetical remarks really added to the book and helped it rise above being a rehash of newspaper accounts and old. Letters.  However, I also found that on occasion there was too much trying to show how much better the late 20th century was from the 19th.  His interjection of the modern mind-set into the Edwardian/Victorian eras was a more of hindrance than help.<br />I did enjopy the book and think is a solid additon to the world of victoria Liturature but I would not reccommend it as a starter book.	2002-01-28

A compelling mix of history and science, which is very readable to the layperson but might be less interesting for a hard-core horologist.<br />This book is short and deftly written to illustrate the haphazard nature of navigation in the days before longitude could be properly measured.  It must have taken great courage to sail the seas when even the most minor miscalculation could imperil the lives of the entire ship's company.<br />The irascible Mr. Harrison is able to make strides in the technologies of horology, which were unprecedented.  However his own temperament mixed with the politically infighting of the Board of Navigation was able to impede these improvements for many years.  The fact that Harrison was one of the yeoman class rather than the aristocracy was to cost him many years of extra endeavor.<br />.  It was also refreshing to not have to deal with the endless drama of Rupert Gould the Naval Officer recovering from a nervous breakdown who the restores the clocks in the early part of the 20th century. The few pages devoted to him are interesting but not integral to the story.<br />This is more a book about corporate politics than it is about the intricacies of timepieces.

Beverly Linet has crafted an adequate if somewhat one-sided biography of Oscar-winning actress, Susan Hayward.<br />Covering her life as a poor girl in Brooklyn with big dreams it moves on through her tempestuous years as a starlet unable to get the lucky breaks.  Her torrid personal life, marriage and divorce to Jess Barker are the main focus of her life in the 1940s-50s.  Susan (born Edythe Marrenner) finally achieves success and recognition as an actress with her Oscar nominated portrayal of an Alcoholic in \\"Smash-Up\\" and achieves happiness in her personally life with marriage to Eaton Chalkley.  After four nominations she finally winners the coveted Oscar in 1959 for \\"I want to live\\".  Tragically, he beloved husband dies in 1966 and after several years in seclusion Susan begins a comeback which is cut short by her death from cancer at the age of 57.<br />Throughout it all Susan remained intensely private.  Her aloofness was a combination of myopia, nature and the years of struggle.  But this only helped to make he as mysterious off screen as she was on it.  This does present some problems for her Biographer.<br />This book is an adequate pop biography.  The author is frank in revealing her admiration for her subject right in the introduction.  However, that would soon be evident even to the casual reader in any event.  Ms Linet has spoken to some family members who never before gave interviews, but she is all to willing to not pursue lines of questions that make those people uncomfortable.  This does tend to create a one-sided view of controversial events.  Too many interesting things are left inadequately covered for the book to be well rounded.  It is however, interesting and informative within these limits and it gives a nice picture of Hollywood during the heyday of the \\"Studio System\\".<br />While I enjoyed this book well enough, I think that Susan Hayward is far more entertaining as an actress than this book was as a biography.	2002-01-14

Whenever I go on a trip and look up my route in a map, it always seems to be in the fold.  Where I want to go is always obscured in the staples and bend of the book.  So too this is an interesting moment in history that seems to have fallen into the divide between the Victorian and Edwardian periods.  I feel that I owe a debt of gratitude to Tony Rennell for taking us through this fascinating moment in history.<br />Victoria by no means had a trouble-free reign.  She was at times highly unpopular and frequently criticized in society and the press. However, after sixty-three years on the throne her stamina and longevity had brought about almost universal admiration and respect from the people of her growing empire and the world in general.  A time before her reign was beyond the living memory of most people in the world.  The prospect of her death was to many even more unthinkable to many than the shadowy past of what had been before.<br />This absorbing and readable book takes the reader into the royal residence at Osborne for a world-shaking event.  The death of Victoria and the ascent of her dissolute heir Edward was a thing feared in many circles. She ruled and empire on which the sun never set and the advent of technology allowed the world to share this occasion in real-time for the first time.<br />Eerily similar in many respects to the way the world reacted at the death of Diana and the events of September 11, the world seemed to stop spinning for those brief but unforgettable days in 1901.  Stores were bereft of customers; places of business shut down while places of worship recorded record breaking attendance.<br />But this is not a book concerned only with high deeds in high places.  It is the story of a family about to lose their matriarch.  It is about the usual squabbles over who is to see the dying woman and who is to make decisions on her behalf.  This is a tale that almost any family member can relate to and it resonates withus all.<br />I cannot think of a book about Victoria and her family that I have enjoyed more in many years.  It is a must read.	2002-01-10

James\\"Whitey\\" Bulger and Stephen \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmi were legendary wiseguys in Boston during the 1970s.  John Connolly a childhood acquaintance of Bulger's who made good and joined the Boston FBI.  When Connolly hooked up with the tough guy from his old neighborhood things began to go awry.<br />Connolly was awed by his friendship with Bulger and used his contact in the underworld as proof of his prowess as an agent.  For their part Bulger and Flemmi were able to pass along innocuous mob gossip to the Feds in exchange for protection form local law enforcement.  Carefully placed tidbits of information helped the FBI to arrest enemies of the Bulger gang.  With each arrest Whitey and Flemmi were able to expand their own power base.  Those people who complained to the police were inevitably redirected to the FBI.  Once the bureau had its hands on a case, the stonewalling began.  This was a cycle that continued from the late 60s up until the mid 90s.  During this period the `invaluable informants' provided little of substance to their `handlers'.  However the agents were able to cook the reports and win commendations and promotions for themselves.  At the same time, over a dozen murders are directly attributed to the pair.<br />If there is honor among thieves you can't prove it from this book.  \\"Black Mass\\" is a shocking story of deceit and corruption within Boston law enforcement, politics and organized crime.  It is almost impossible to describe the level of hubris on the part of the crooks who were protected by the FBI and those very agents who cosseted the killers in order to advance their own careers.  If they are lucky, the crooks end up behind bars, but many meet their fate in the trunk of a car.<br />No small part of this seems to flow from good old-fashioned insularity, the \\"Us vs. Them\\" mentality so prevalent in South Boston.  The area was still reeling throughout the 1970s from the forced bussing earlier in the decade.  To many Bulger, was a mythic Robin Hood figure.  He might be a crook but he was Southie's crook and a damned good one at that.  With a cunning that allowed him to outwit the police at every turn, it was a blow for hometown pride that the Italian Mafia was failing while the Irish mob was waxing in power.  This was the myth that the Bulger gang worked to promote while at the same time Whitey was murdering and extorting from the citizens of his old neighborhood.  His cunning ability to outwit the police boiled down to being an informant for the FBI and his concern for the streets he grew up on is evident by how he promoted the use of drugs to the people in Southie.<br />This account is a sad story of how the best intentions (Like the FBI informant program) can have the worst results.	2002-01-04

It was here that Hitler staged his magnificent rallies to inspire his ardent followers and convince everybody else to become ardent followers. It was in the city of Nuremberg that the first of many laws directed against Jews we issued.  It is most famous today as the city where the last drama of the third Reich was played out.  The triumphant allied powers chose this city for their trials of those nazi leaders who survived.  It was also the site of the executions for eleven of those leaders.<br />Joe Persico has crafted an excellent overview of this historic event.  From soup to nuts almost no facet of the trial is left uncovered.  He begins with the decisions made by the allied leaders early in the war to hold try the leaders of the third Reich as opposed to summary executions (the method endorsed by Winston Churchill).  This was no easy decision considering that the whole world had already learned to scoff at the showpiece justice meted out to victims of Stalin in the USSR.  The wisdom of having a trial and declaring that justice would triumph was a debate begun while the war still raged in Europe.  Whether the trial was fair and just or simply a case of victor's vengeance wrapped up in judicial robes is still debated.<br />The book covers those early steps and the political debates that raged across three continents about how to try and convict such obviously evil men as Goring and Ribbentrop.  Laws were drafted, trial procedures were written locations for the trial and accommodations for all the support personnel had to be found in a country decimated by six years of war.  Documents and witness were in a myriad of languages; oral testimony was only possible with the intervention of IBM's new simultaneous translation equipment (never before used). From the large battles of the proceedings (Goring Vs Jackson, Speer vs. Goring, Allies vs. the Russians) to some of the more mundane andunexpected.  The American prosecutor and his battles with the American justices.  The Jailer at the prison fighting a losing battle to keep his prized prisoners alive and silent.  The prison psychologist and his fight with the prison physiatrist.  The list of internal squabbles goes on for so long that it is a wonder ANYTHING got done at the trial.<br />On top of that there was significant debate of who was even to be charged. Was the Amy or Navy to be held responsible for carrying out the orders of their government?  Were the high ranking officials of a ministry culpable for carrying out the directives issued by their superiors?  In a dictatorship run by one man was anybody responsible for anything?  This was the starting point on which history was to be made.<br />However it is less than an in-depth look at the politics behind the last battle of WW2 and perhaps the first one of the Cold War. Often the coverage of a given topic or area lapses into brief vignettes of people and events. Sometimes it can be hard to see the conclusion the author makes about an incident with only the briefest background provided.  While this can be a little annoying at first I chose to look at the book as a splendid introduction to an area of history that I can explore more about on my own.	2002-01-02

Knowing this, one wonders why<br />the book was written at all.<br />Both the author and the Prince were born in 1948, thus after a few years<br />training, as a footman Barry is the right man of the right age in the right<br />place to become the valet to Charles.  This relationship persists until<br />shortly after his wedding to Diana. That proved to be a period during which<br />many of the long-term servants of the household go on to new duties.<br />Strongly and repeatedly denying any sort of a fight between himself and the<br />Princess, Barry writes &quot;Understandably she would not wish to have around<br />herself and her husband those who had known him at earlier times when there<br />were other girl friends&quot;.<br />Primarily, the book is organized along topical lines.  Travel with the<br />Prince, Holidays with the Prince, the Prince and the other members of the<br />family, The many girl friends of the Prince, and so on.  There is also some<br />material organized in a chronological fashion about the duties that Barry<br />held in the palace prior to his work for Charles.<br />Barry is the first to point out the dichotomy of the situation that he was<br />in.  He often saw more of his royal master that Charles' family or friends.<br />And yet it was always from the perspective of the master/servant<br />relationship.  After all, &quot;However kind and friendly they are, in the end<br />they are Royal&quot;.<br />Barry is quick to play up this relationship (going so far to point out that<br />at least one portrait of the Prince is Charles' head and Barry's body wearing<br />garter robes).  However he often gives short shrift to the many other members<br />of the team who worked with the Prince.  While the Policemen who serve<br />Charles often are mentioned in anecdotes it is only on occasion that we hear<br />about the junior valet who also works with Barry to tend to the Prince.  In<br />fact the assistant is never mentioned by name!<br />While the book hints at many things in the intimate female relationships the<br />Prince has had Barry is quick to mention that Charles always handled his love<br />interests with such discretion that Barry never found the Prince in bed with<br />anyone!  This comes after he repeatedly states how it was his duty to awaken<br />Charles each morning at 7:50.  This may or may not be so but in any event it<br />belies the closeness that Barry seems to have felt.<br />Time has not been good to this book.  It abounds with many unintended<br />ironies.  Barry himself did not live to see all of them come to public light<br />but here is a sample of some from the book:<br /> &quot;People always seemed to die when we were at Balmoral.  This complicated<br />things for me, getting the Prince's wardrobe together&quot;<br />On Camilla --<br />&quot;For many years before he married, the gossip was that the Prince of Wales<br />was strongly influenced in his choice of girl friends by two married women -<br />Lady Tryon ....

Just when things are going so well, it all seems to fall apart.<br />Tracy begins to have trouble adjusting to the size and gloomy atmosphere of her new school.  Her best friend seems to be drifting into a new and less pleasant person to be around.  Tracy's grades start to slip her performance in gym class is almost failing and to top it off her parents are convinced that a trip to the optometrist will prove to be a cure-all.  As the novel progresses however, Tracy begins to suspect that there is something more seriously wrong with her eyes.  Her efforts to conceal the problems she experiences only serve to make matters worse.  The help she needs to face the diagnosis comes from an unexpected source, and with that she is able to face whatever the future has in store for her.<br />Debbie Kent has written a good book that really works hard to illustrate the point that blindness is a part of who a person is but not the sum total.  The problems that Tracy has with her eyes are one facet of the book and its main character.  What the book takes pains to make sure we understand is that Tracy is also any teenage girl and going blind doesn't make her a 'Martian' even though that is how people start to treat her.<br />It is a helpful look at how the differently-abled are not really so different.	2001-12-26

I can't blame Ira Levin for one clunker after all the great works that he has created, but how did this one get past any publisher or editor?<br />The beauty of Baby was the banality of it all.  Who would have thought that the leading Satan worshippers of 1965 argued about spilling root beer on the carpet or kept \\"Jokes for the John\\" in the bathroom?  What is so unusual about a woman who is pregnant stepping out of the social whirl she is accustomed to and attaching her self to a motherly woman?  Hutch had served as a surrogate father and he had served her well.  I certainly know several people who have been told by doctors to not read books or look on the web or talk to friends about medical issues (all with a variant of `did they go to medical school').  The crux of this book was that even paranoids do have enemies.  Each individual part of the work was so believable that the ending was all the more shocking.<br />Son of Rosemary lacks all these common touches.  Here everything is on a big stage.  Ro has been in the longest coma ever.  Her son is the most popular person on the planet.  When they first meet as adults the phone company records the highest usage ever.  He is organizing the biggest event in the history of mankind.  Do you see where this is going?  The whole `you are there' nature of Levin's writing is ill suited to making the spectacular mundane.  Rosemary is just a little too quick to adapt to the whole situation and fall into becoming one of the elite.  The world seems a little too ready to fall into the trap of believing in the latest hero.<br />The events in Rosemary's Baby are commonplace and fall under the radar but even then one man is able to figure much of it out.  In the sequel, the events are just too large to NOT be subjected to the most stringent scrutiny.  Where is the press finding out what happened to Guy?  Where are the legions of reporters who never noticed that Minnie was far too old to have a child?  How about the enterprising reporter who breaks the story that Roman Castavet was the son of a leading devil-worshipper?  Since the 1970's nobody gets that big without someone taking a good hard long look at the money trail.<br />This novel is a fast read.  I think that some people have been reading it a little faster than they should have.  The ending seems to many readers to be a complete Dallas style copout.  However If you recall in the first book Rosemary has dream in that one as well.  She dreams she meets President Kennedy and the Pope and in the end that she is having sex with an un-human monster.	2001-12-05

The US submarine fleet inflicted the heaviest damages on Japan's ability to fight of all the WW2 fighting units.  And they did this with only 2% of the navy's personnel !<br />But this book is not about the grand strategies of the naval war. It is a very personal memoir about one man's experiences as a torpedo man.<br />Sam McLeod was a teenager when he volunteered for duty on the boats during the war.  He goes into detail about the difficult training he and his fellow submariners received.  He then recounts his experiences on many missions in several boats.  He makes sure to break up the tension with humorous anecdotes and personal vignettes about many of his fellow crewmates.<br />Unlike so many of the sub book authors, McLeod served as an enlisted man.  This is a fresh perspective.  he spends a great deal more time than most books discussing the details of how the sub operates (how to load a torpedo and how to clean out a head among them) and he also shows how the petty tyrants of the Navy could always find someone to pick on among the crew.  This is a very different view of the war from the captains and officers who ran the subs.<br />By the end of this book Sam is still young in years but old in the ways of war.	2001-11-13

For anyone interested in the period this is defiantly a must read.  However there one  issues that I take with the book. One is that Ms Fraser's good schooling shines through on many pages as she often quotes a line of two from Mary written in French without bothering to provide the led elite with a translation.  This can often make funny little anecdotes seem rather pointless to the  reader.<br />Still there is no better way to discover the full scope of Mary and how people and events all conspired against her.<br />Perhaps no resident of Edinburgh is more famous than Mary Queen of Scots. Ironically, she lived in the land for only twelve of her forty-four years and her period of personal rule lasted a mere six years, none of which were free from strife.<br />Born as her father lay dying she became Queen before she was a week old. During her infancy King Henry VIII of England raided the country several times in order to kidnap the girl and secure her as a bride for his son Edward. She was sent to France by her Mother and raised as a daughter by the King. At the age of 16 she married the heir to the French throne who became King shortly thereafter. When her young husband died a year into his reign she was left a teenaged childless Queen Dowager.<br />She returned to the land of her birth to find herself a Catholic Queen in a country in the midst of Protestant Reformation. Many of her protestant subjects feared that she would become a second 'Bloody Mary' and like her cousin Mary Tudor attempt to force her country back to the Catholic faith. Plots and rebellions against her were a persistent occurrence. Knowing herself to be in a weak position, needing to keep both her Catholic allies and her subjects contented, Mary set a policy of tolerance and moderation in religious matters. Radicals on both sides of the religious spectrum found fault with Mary's tolerance of the religious diversity in Scotland.<br />Mary herself made matters worse by her disastrous romances. She married her cousin Henry Darnley in the hopes of strengthening her claim to the English throne. After only a few short months he began to plot against her in the hope of securing the throne of Scotland for himself. He and other Scottish nobles murdered Mary's private secretary and friend David Rizzio as she watched, helpless to intervene. When Mary was able to put down this rebellion he turned on his former allies and attempted unsuccessfully to reconcile with the Queen. In the end his erstwhile allies disgusted at his betrayal murdered him as he lay ill at his home Kirk O' Field. It is still debated how much Mary herself knew about the plans to murder her husband the Scottish king.<br />With Darnley out of the way the remaining Scottish lords were horrified when one of their own kidnapped Mary and became her third husband. He was James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell was one of the leading suspects in the murder of Darnley. Her marriage to him cost her the love of her people, her tenuous friendship with her cousin Elizabeth I, and her catholic allies around Europe. In one short month Mary was driven from the throne, forced to abdicate in favor of her infant son and placed in captivity by the Scottish lords. Her husband escaped the country only to be taken prisoner in Denmark. Bothwell would live another eleven years in a dungeon slowly going insane.<br />Mary was also able to escape from her prison, the castle and Lochleven, and she made her way to the English border. Mary of Scotland was the last person whom Elizabeth would wish to see in her kingdom. Viewed by many Catholics as the rightful Queen of England, Mary was a great danger to Elizabeth. Mary became Elizabeth's &quot;guest&quot; and spent nineteen years in captivity in her cousin's country. Since Mary was also the unacknowledged heir to the throne, her jailers were always cautious totreat her with the respect due to one so close to becoming Queen of the land.<br />As the years passed the captive Mary became a romantic figure to many and was able to restore the reputation lost by her marriage to Bothwell. In hopes of securing her freedom and of capturing Elizabeth's throne, Mary began to communicate clandestinely with English Catholics and her European allies. Using her claim to the English throne as leverage, she began to look for a fourth husband who would free her, overthrow Elizabeth and rule at her side. Eventually Elizabeth was forced to have Mary executed in 1587.<br />Her execution led Phillip of Spain to launch the armada against England in 1588. Mary was never able to sit on the throne of England as Queen. However, since 1603 all the monarchs of England have been her direct descendants. She is buried in Westminster Abbey in London, a city she never saw while alive.	2001-11-13

Given the lurid tabloid journalism, to which Diana was subjected during her lifetime, this account is a well-written and interesting overview of her life and her tragic death.<br />Despite the title the book covers much more than just the day of her death.  It gives an overview of her whirlwind romance with Dodi as well as the stormy relationship that she had with the rest of her royal ex-relatives.  If this is the first Diana book that you read there is more than enough background material here to make sure that you do not feel left out.  Even if you are a royal-phile with a stack of books on the trials and tribulations of the Windsor family, there is plenty here to keep you avidly turning the pages.<br />In addition to Diana's fateful last day there is extensive coverage of the immediate aftermath of the accident and the extensive, if ineffectual, care that she was given at the seen.  The standard care given in car crashes on Paris soil might be viewed as a scandal in itself.<br />Christopher Anderson is able to present to us the reaction of the Royal family ensconced in Scotland at the time, the reaction of her ex-husband and of the Queen.  Her Majesty retreated into duty and protocol trying even to prevent her son from making the journey to retrieve Diana's body.  The Wales' sons were kept out of the limelight and did not learn for some time about the enormous outpouring of grief surrounding the accident.<br />This was an event that evoked the sympathy of the world. In light of the events of 9/11/2001 it might now seem foolish that we could ever expend so much grief on one person.  But I think that this book helps to show how in life and in death Diana was the lens through which so much emotion the world over was brought into focus.	2001-11-12

Carolly Erickson may or may not be a great biographer, however this is not a great biography.  At the conclusion of this book, I did not feel that I had come to know Alexandra any better that I had some 330 pages earlier.<br />Alexandra was born Princess Alix of Hesse just as that little country was in the process of being subsumed into the untied Germany that we have come to know today.  At and early age the entire family was sickened with diphtheria and Alix's sister and mother both died.  Changing her bright nature (she was nicknamed `Sunny') into a darker more introspective one<br />Through her famous grandmother (Victoria of England), she was related to all the right people.  Due to her famous beauty (only her sister was thought to surpass her among the eligible royalty of her day), she was assured of a marriage to bring happiness and fortune.<br />She defied her family and turned down the future King of England to marry the heir to Russian throne.  Theirs was truly a match of love that was able to endure.  And it certainly had a lot to endure.  Tragedy seemed to stalk the young woman.  The wedding  plans so carefully begun were cast aside as her future father-in-law Tsar Alexander III died unexpectedly leaving her fianc&eacute;e unprepared and untutored for the immense responsibilities as leader of all the Russias.  She came to the country behind the Alexander's coffin and was never able to learn about the land or the people as one of them.  Instead she became the social leader of country in which she was unable to speak the language and in which she did not know the customs.  Princess  Alix (now Empress Alexandra), was never able to find a place within Russian society.<br />The empress was unable for years to produce the son so vitally needed for the succession.  When she finally gave birth to Alexei , he was so discovered to be a victim of hemophilia and unlikely to survive into adulthood.  Knowing that this latest curse had come from her genes, drove Alexandra into a frenzy to find a cure or at least salvation for this most important son<br />Always strong in belief, she turned increasing to the fringes of the Orthodox religion, finding at last the man she called `our friend'.  Rasputin was a man well known among the Russian upper classes.  He was a drunk who gambled extensively, who slept with any woman he could find , and who boasted about his exploits among the upper-classes.  Alexandra could see only his simple faith and the way in which he alone could ease the pain of her crippled son.  Her increasing reliance on this man helped to alienate her and her husband even more from the ruling classes of the nation.<br />In time the wide gulf between the rich and poor would become too wide a gap.  There was no longer any hope by the peasant classes in their `little father' and `little mother'.  WWI and the horrific death toll was the final straw on the overburdened populace.  The Tsar was deposed and he and his whole family were imprisoned and eventually executed.<br />Too much of this book reads like a novel .  The author often presumes to tell us how the characters felt about a situation without bothering to back it up.  There is far too much use of phrases like `she must have felt'  in this book.<br />Too little of it is well documented in the text or  footnotes.  All too often there would some interesting bit of knowledge that I had not known before and when I went to look up the source there was not a word in the notes.  This makes it very frustrating for me to judge the sources based on my prior reading.  However I doubt if a casual reader would find this much of a detriment.<br />Erickson has also presented a view of the Empress that I have not often seen in other books.  Most books seem to have felt that Alexandra was shy in public but warmheartd in person.  That the country's view of her as selfish and capricous shows how much they misunderstood her true intentions.  Carolly Erickson seems to take the view thatthe Empress was in fact selfsh and capricous , although she was a devoted mother to her son and wife to her husband.  She is viewed as neglecting her daughters, as a `parvenue' and a spiteful woman.  Perhaps.  But I think that I will wait for a more detailed, more researched book before I make my conclusions.	2001-11-12

Its poor quality is apparent almost form the first page.

For years he had dental problems stemming from accident at a party.  His life revolves around the amateur magazine he and his group of friends published but that has gone under.  His parents fail to respond to his many withering criticism of their lives by the wise son they have raised.  And as if all that wasn't bad enough, they also refuse to pay for the expensive dental work he needs.  I wouldn't pay for it either as Neil seems to always find enough money when he needs it to indulge his hedonistic lifestyle.  Including the epic journey around he world that he takes to recover from his experience &quot;selling out&quot; his talent by actually working for someone for a change.<br />This character makes me ashamed to be in Generation X.  With that as a start,  the author spends most of the book name dropping (thinly veiled pseudonyms) and explaining about how hard it is to be famous to 15 people.<br />It was boring.

And some of the startling facts reveled include things like the fast food industry hires kids and otherwise marginally employable people because they want to pay them low wages.  WOW ! Who could have seen that coming ?<br />However it was shocking to know that at the same time I was watching a riveting video on cleaning tables &quot;Lot and Lobby&quot; (What a classic.  Even better than the one about the fry machine), McD's was getting tax credit for my 'training'.  In fact McD's and other fast food companies often hire workers whose jobs last just about as long as the training tax credits !  Now, that was news.<br />Sure McD's is bound to be a major force in the beef industry, but did you know that they use beef flavor in the chicken ? and in the fries ?  Did you know that McDonalds and the other fast food chain have combined to turn the meatpacking industry into the one of the most dangerous jobs in America ?

A light - gossipy style helps to make  the generations fly by.  The foibles of the modern aristocracy pale in  comparison with the lifestyles of their predecessors.<br />If all that you  want is to read about the young girl who was 'hired' to prop up a tottering  throne - then I suggest that you look elsewhere.  If however you want an  interesting light history of the rise of one of England's great noble  families, this is a fine place to start.	2000-09-18

While simply written  (&quot;understated&quot; is a huge overstatement) there is a requirement to  read carefully.  Each and every bit of story is carefully crafted and  lovingly placed in just the right spot.  There is not a word or a sentence  that does not add to the book.<br />Miss a paragraph and you miss a lot.  Miss this novel and there will be a hole in your collection of great books.	2000-09-15

Barbara Bush is a wonderful reader and she tells a good story.  She is candid (to a point) about her own failings and doesn't mind ignoring things that are personal and not going to be covered.

The whole &quot;those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it&quot;. This book spent the entire time in the past  so several characters were not able to appear.  I also thought the book  was way too carried away on putting &quot;Thees and Thous&quot; in and  neglecting minor things like plot.	1999-06-30

I did read the whole series.  I got one for free and bought the rest on Amazon.  My take on the whole thing is that the characters would have needed a lot of work to be made two-dimensonal.  The  plot was of a quality I haven't seen since my days in Junior High School.  Things I just didn't get: I could see the power struggle before he is king  (Book 1) and during the  first part of his reign (Book 2), but towards the  end it was getting impossible to believe that anyone would go against the  Pharoh.  It would seem that there were only six or seven patriots loyal to  Egypt or simply to Ramses.  Everyone else even the highest governent  offical was just a party hack waiting to get a crack at the king.  By book  5 it was like the Keystone Kriminals plotting against the wise and  all-powerful Pahroh.  The history needed a serious re-write.  The Author  had to juggle around a lot of serious problems.  The hundreds of Children  that Ramses had are disposed of with a royal decree to adopt !! then for  the rest of the story they are mosty ignored Ramses never even speaks to  one as far as I can recall. His marriage to his daughter is also a delicate  subject that is glossed over rather neatly.<br />I read them but I can't  really reccomend them and unlike most books I get all the way through I  know that I will never have the desire to pick them up again.	1999-06-09

What a great twist on the 20th Century kid goes back to a historic event type of book.  I did think that a little of the crisis was too contrived in order to get the plot moving.  I'll chalk this up to it's being a first novel.  That said I enjoyed the  book a great deal.	1999-06-03

It was an amazing story, full of candor, by an american communist and soldier who abandoned the US to join the communist revolution.  Honestly, I was apalled at how gullible this  man was.  His arrested once and spends six years in prison convincing  himself that even if he did nothing wrong, it was patriotic of him to not  complain.  After his realease, he particiaptes in every 'fad' that comes  along.  Even the ones he disagrees with.  He is a strong and vocal  supporter of the cultural revolution until he becomes a victim of it.  He  speaks as if he was a high ranking member of the party, though he never  seems to have any discretionary power.  He never seems to notice that he is  a forign 'dupe' used to give the regime respecabilty.  Well written and  well narrated with frigtening content.  How this man earn a living in the  US as an expert on a country he never seemed to understand is beyond me.	1999-04-14

The author of this book was able to get in touch with many of the key players in the Goering's life.  This of course allows for interesting facts and stories to come to light.  It also allows these people to make a last  ditch attempt to color history to their own views.  Mosley tells us of the  dashing young war hero reduced to becoming a drug addict and how he finds a  new and better reason to live in the ideas of Adolf Hitler.  Mosley  himself once met Goering and the book shows that he was not quite able to  resist the Reich Marshal's charms.  Mosely wrote a book that presents a  complicated picture of a not-so-complicated man. History now takes a dimmer  view of the people who wanted peace but let themselves be blinded by Hitler  and his dreams.	1999-02-01

More than that however it is a haunting  portrait of the entire generation that stood by.  To me the most chilling portions of the book came not from Speer himself but rather from the many interviews the author conducts on her research.   Time and again we hear from the many people, often high ranking, who had no idea that anything was amiss.  The statements that these people make always concede how difficult life was for Jews, how Jews were denied their rights, denied their jobs, and eventually carted away `to the east'.    Speer himself is a man willing to assume responsibility for the actions of the regime but who simultaneously seems to have no actions of his own to regret.    We are allowed to look into his life and meet the many people in whom he inspired great feelings of loyalty.  By and large this becomes a long list of people that the charming Mr. Speer uses and discards at his conven! ience.  From his college friends to his assistants during the war years,  to his own family during the spandau years.   But never fear the book does have a happy end, after  a few more betrayals  Albert is able to look back on his life with the satisfaction of knowing how he single handedly dragged the war on for months beyond when it should have lasted.	1998-07-24
