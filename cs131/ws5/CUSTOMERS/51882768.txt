It is fast faced and interesting.  There is, however, a huge problem:  it is riddled with mistakes.  Sentences are missing periods.  Words that don't belong are inserted.  There is a sentence that has so many mistakes that I had no clue what the author was trying to write.  I have never seen a book with so many mistakes in my life.<br />Note to publishing company:  Hire a proofreader that can read!	2002-11-02

It is--however--something most of his works are not: easy to understand.  I read it for the first time yesterday, and I didn't have to re-read any passages or consult any footnotes.  If you want to give Shakespeare a try but are worried it will be over your head, give this one a shot.	2001-05-29

Two of the best are from Mississippi: Lewis Nordan and Larry Brown.<br />I won't lie--Nordan is the better of the two, but &quot;Facing the Music&quot; is proof that Brown can hold his own.  In this collection of short stories, Brown gives readers a real-life view of southern relationships.  Full of drunkeness, violence and bitterness, these stories paint a true picture of love in the South.  There is, however, a tenderness in some of these stories that make you understand why lovers even try in the first place.<br />Give this one a chance.  You wont regret it.	2001-01-07

As most, I started with &quot;White Noise.&quot;  &quot;White Noise&quot; is--of course--a brilliant novel.  &quot;Mao II&quot; isn't quite as good, but it is still a great book.  It reads quickly.

I finally found a copy (2 years after graduation) and read it on a flight home from San Francisco.  It is an interesting work.  Solanas's veiws are, of course, radical, but they certainly are not boring.  I think we will see this work get a lot more credit in the years to come.  It may even find itself being antholigized.	2001-01-05

Adrian is now thirty and as clueless and funny as ever.  I have always been impressed with Townsend's talent: her ability to reveal information about Adrian that he himself is unaware of.  The Adrian Mole books are some of the few books out there that will make you laugh out loud.  This one is no exception.	2000-11-24

As a recent Pug owner, I couldn't pass this book up, and I'm sure glad I  didn't.  Margo Kaufman is very, very funny.<br />Kaufman discusses her love of  Pugs and her history of ownership.  The standout is, of course, Clara, a  12-pound Pug who demands attention wherever the couple goes.  She is such  an adorable companion that Kaufman finds it impossible to travel anywhere  without Clara, even on book-signing tours.<br />A large portion of this book  focuses on an international adoption, but--believe it or not--this doesn't  distract from the story.  In fact, it makes for a sometimes-funny,  sometimes-touching tale.<br />If you love Pugs, pick this book up.  You won't  regret it.	2000-09-06

I generally say that they are two different mediums and cannot  be compared: apples and oranges.<br />In the case of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S,  the two (the book and the movie) are actually very close, but the book will  give you insight that the movie won't.

David Sedaris succeeds at fiction almost as well as he does at non-fiction.  All the stories in this book prove that Sedaris is funny as hell and that he can write pretty  darned good too.  Just thinking about the story &quot;The Last You'll Hear  from Me&quot; still makes me laugh just thinking about it.  I want  &quot;The Bible says that it's all right to cast the first stone if someone  dead is telling you to do it&quot; engraved on my headstone.<br />If you  haven't read NAKED, pick it up first.

Several people suggested that I read it, and I ignored them for a long time: I had a lot of other books I wanted to get to first.  I finally read it this weekend.   The next thing I knew, I was ordering HOLIDAYS ON ICE and BARREL  FEVER.<br />NAKED is a collection of true stories from David Sedaris's life.   I only wish my life was half as funny.  <br />&quot;Chipped Beef,&quot;  &quot;Get Your Ya-Ya's Out&quot; and &quot;I Like Guys&quot; are highlights  of this collection, but the funniest story is &quot;A Plague of Tics.&quot;   In it, Sedaris discusses his strange behaviors as a child: licking  lightswitches, hitting himself with his shoe.  I laughed so hard reading  this story that my roommate told me I was going to have to shut up.<br />Give  NAKED a shot.  If you like it, pick up BARREL FEVER.  It isn't as funny,  but it's close.	2000-03-21

And (to be honest) I don't really like it either.<br />It is the story of Finny and  Gene--two sixteen-year-old boys in a private school in New England.  Gene  knocks Finny from a tree early in the novel, leaving the reader several  questions: Why did Gene do it?  Does Finny know Gene did it?  What does the  tree symbolize?  What is the relationship between the school and WWII?  Why  is this young-adult classic putting me to sleep?<br />This isn't a bad novel  for a kid, but I would suggest that anyone with above a 5th-grade reading  level stay away from it--unless you are having trouble sleeping.	2000-03-18

This book is funny--very, very funny.<br />If you are a fan of magic realism--Salman Rushdie, Gabriel Garcia Marquez--you have to give  this novel a try; it is magic realism with a southern twist.  Lightning  continues to strike the house, becoming a living, breathing character in  the novel.  Magazines glow.  A girl with fins twirls a baton with amazing  talent.<br />About half way through this book, you will be back online looking  for other Lewis Nordan novels, so you won't have to wait a second between  books.	2000-03-18

This is a big problem with a lot of novelists writing today--they aren't saying anything.  Plot takes a backseat to what Kudera is saying, though the plot  isn't bad.  It is difficult to peel back the layers of Kundera's point,  but--as the title shows--he's commenting on identity: the identity we  create for ourselves and the identity we create for others in our own mind.   The novel raises more questions than it answers, but that's the sign of a  great novel.  Isn't it?	2000-03-16

I have two: Muriel Spark and Kurt Vonnegut.  I am not the kind of guy who walks around pretending to be a writer; I am no writer.  I  do, however, love to read about what makes writers tick, what inspires them  to write.  This is one of the reasons I picked up this tiny book--I hoped  it would give me some insight.  I didn't.       The conversations, at  times, are interesting.  But it wasn't worth the cash I shelled out for the  79 pages.

It is the kind of novel that you cannot put down, not because the plot is so exciting, but  because he offers such insight.  Warning: this book is--for some unknown  reason--deeply upsetting.  You seem to travel so deep into the mind of the  narrator, who seems a lot like Kureishi himself, that escape is futile.   This book will control your emotions for days after you've finished it.	2000-03-15

That is until this year when I was forced to read it again in order to teach it to my tenth-grade class.  I had forgotten what a great read it is.  As a teen, I missed out on so much that Golding had  intended.  Today--now that I'm a little older, a little better at  understanding novels--I see so much more.  The symbolism is wonderful, as  is the book as whole.  Plus: this is a beautiful edition and the E.M.  Forster intro is brilliant.  If you are looking for a heavy read, you might  want to try something else.  But, if you're looking for a great, quick  read, give &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; a whirl.	2000-03-14

The result is &quot;Sugar Among the Freaks,&quot; a  collection of stories about southern living, most of which contain a freak  of some sort.  The stories will make you laugh out loud at times and cry  inside at others.  The end result is that horrible realization that  you--the reader--are the truest freak of them all.	2000-02-23
