US	52736258	R11VU0BAUJC2YY	0345457242	772147660	Drive to the East (Settling Accounts Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Chilling	This is the best book of the series since it started with How Few Remain almost a decade ago. Following were three books dealing with WW1 fought in all gruesome details on the soil of North America, three more books dealing with an inter-war period of despair and the rise of a Nazi-like regime in the South and now we are in the middle of a WW2 that started one book ago. <br /> <br />It is a WW2 different from the one known to the average western reader, because here the Wehrmacht campaign in Russia has been the inspiration. With partisans and a Stalingrad included. And an Endloesung. <br /> <br />All this is presented in chilling details. The characters already known to the reader of the series experience a war becoming more and more brutal. Two of them are killed of and not replaced thereby streamlining the tale.  <br /> <br />There are very touching scenes: the despair and feeling of inevitable doom experienced by Scipio in Augusta, the killing of a young man who in another universe would become president, ... <br /> <br />A great book, but chilling. Five stars for those already familiar with the series, maybe one less for those new to it.	2005-09-02
US	52736258	R545BASZ1W39T	0380818604	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	5	3	4	N	N	I was wrong	I admit it: I was wrong. When it was first published I did not buy because it was fantasy, even though I am a dedicated Vorkossigan-fan. Now, since there are no new books from that series forthcoming, I turned to it because I said to myself that with this author even if it is fantasy it should be a pleasant read while traveling on business. But I was wrong. <br /> <br />In fact this is an outstanding book, on par with the best of the Vorkossigan-series. Its hero Caz is a very Milesian character and the setting in a world similar to Spain during the reconquista makes it colorful and enchanting. <br /> <br />What makes it so much different from the Vorkossigans are the five gods who play an important part in this book. Whereas Barrayar is a world of customs and tradition but not of religion, Chalion is full of the supernatural. But still the story is about the essence of life and honor. <br /> <br />I will correct my error and buy the Paladin of Souls and the forthcoming Hallowed Hunt. But still, I hope for a new Vorkossigan.	2005-05-18

Unfortunately the book quite often gives the impression as if a lot of good story lines were not quite developed because of an impeding publishing deadline.  <br /> <br />Especially the conclusion of the story leaves an empty feeling as if one was cheated out of a fantasy. So it's just a nice weekend read.	2004-09-06

However its execution and therefore the book is ridiculous at best, if not outright damnable. <br /> <br />Two of the scenarios, 1866 and 1916, are actually quite interesting and would have deserved better, grammatically correct English would have been a first step. Some are downright silly like Napoleon Bonaparte as third president of the US; others are absolute crap and read like the wet dream of an old Nazi. <br /> <br />What hurts is the total disregard for facts. To give one example: Napoleon Bonaparte, born in 1769, could not have been a candidate for president in 1804. For that you have to be 40. And so on, and so on ... <br /> <br />So my advice for prospective readers: go for a walk instead.	2004-09-06

Even if I had some doubts its basic idea, namely that the Boer War was an event that defined the beginning of the decline of the British Empire, is one I share.  Being also a fan of alt history I ordered the book and started to read. I got as far as page 132 before I decided to quit. <br /> <br />Since I neither own a bulldog nor ever aspire to do so I guess I was disqualified from enjoying it. Because this book is NOT alt history but should rather be qualified as fantasy. God makes an appearance and tells us that a) the Jews are His chosen people and b) that bulldogs are his chosen dogs.  <br /> <br />Sometimes amazon lures you into buying trash.	2004-08-18

And this is it - at least as far as the civil war is concerned this small booklet is one of the earliest efforts in \\"what if?\\"<br />That it was originally published in a magazine is quite obvious, since it rather tells about events and effects like a cursory book-review. But even more obvious is the time when it was written, 1960.<br />The author lets his readers suppose that the south won at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, the USA and CSA separated but joined WW1 and 2 together and on the centennial of separation will consolidate again.  Well, the common bond of service in WW2 was strongly felt by the generation serving in it, and in 1960 the American dream seemed all-conquering.<br />But that history would have continued as before and the USA and CSA would have been on the same side (at least in WW1) is a very optimistic assumption, disregarding the butterfly effect. It is interesting to note that at nearly the same time this story was written Ward Moore in his \\"Jubilee\\" comes to other conclusions.<br />Harry Turtledove writes an introduction in which he praises this book and credits it with inspiring him with his Great War series. I wonder why he decided not to let Texas secede from the confederacy in his series. Or is that still to come?<br />Anyway this booklet is more a curiosity than a work of alternative history worth reading. No butterflies worth catching and looking at here.	2004-07-01

Those involve the local government, the church, nasty foreign agents working for an unfriendly foreign government (French, naturally) and deep undisclosed agenda of the government back home.<br />All works out fine in the end but the survival of most of the heroes is a miracle. Especially considering the dire situations, lunatic locals, hare-brained schemes and unlikely odds they all had to face. All happening in very colorful places and involving lots of unknown history and important Italians.<br />Sounds almost like a cross between a novel by Eric Ambler and a movie from the 60s. But since the Americans involved are not only out of place, but this being the \\"1632\\" universe created by Eric Flint, this is supposed to be science fiction. <br />But alas, the story could have needed some stricter editing. It is almost impossible to drop an Ambler novel before reading it to the last page. Here, dropping a third of the 540 pages would have improved the story very much. Instead the story bumbles along like its heroes on Italian roads.<br />The quintessential content of this book probably would have made a good short novel in the online \\"Grantville Gazette\\" or in another anthology like \\"Ring of Fire\\". As it is it is acceptable - I liked it, but could have been so much better if shorter! Waiting for the paperback is recommended.	2004-06-07

So the mystery gets solved, the hero - who BTW is a self-centered, unbearable self-righteous ass - goes on to we now know where. <br />In the end all of this leaves a stale taste. Could he not have stopped 15 pages earlier?  The story-ark was finished and speaking for myself I like to fill a few blank spots from my own imagination. The best sequels are the ones the author never writes but the reader imagines himself. So thank you very much Mr. Sawyer for killing that of.<br />Since the same already happened in \\"Calculating God\\" and \\"Frameshift\\" I doubt that I will buy another of his novels soon.	2004-05-06

The drawings are excellent, a fine mixture of realistic and cartoon with lots of subtle information in the frames. The texts are funny. The message is gripping: without water (we) all will go away.<br />From this book one can learn about the animals, the various continents and environments they live in, numbers one till ten. It is an experience for father and son to learn about the marvel of the waterhole.	2004-05-06

The resulting learning process for both sides makes a gripping read and is often quite funny. <BR>Some stories are overdoing it (Here Comes Santa Claus), but by and large all tell a tale of a world trying to adapt to the change inflicted upon it by the miraculous appearance of a town from the future.<BR>All those who want to stick to their old ways, Germans and Americans alike, do not stand a chance.

US	52736258	RPTMZH5FV9GA9	0805068848	593111837	A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Not much change in just a century...	This book is very entertaining to read, spanning a period of eight crucial years for the Middle East but mainly focused on the tug-of-war between the various factions inside the government of the then dominant power, Britain. Readers who thought that the nation who ran the biggest empire the world has ever seen had a plan for its policy regarding the fate of the Ottoman Empire will be in for a surprise.<br /> There were in fact several factions within the then government of Britain driven by their respective narrower interests and prejudices and no overall policy at all. Sounding familiar? As a gesture towards an ally in distress Britain then discards its century-old policy of sustaining the Ottoman Empire but soon finds itself quarreling with all allies about their share of the pie. <br />The locals try to get most out of all the players and are not willing to play by anybody else's rules. The new government wants to cut out all the allies to get all for Britain. A lot of amateurs think they are experts and confuse everybody and in the end there is a war after the war with everyone for himself and all against Britain.<br />Now if this book were not written in 1989 I would suspect that the author really wants to make a point about US policy towards Iraq following the wars of 1991 and 2003. Alas and unfortunately it is not a case of prescience either but the sad fact that in the area of the world known as the Middle East things do not change so much in just a century.<br />While the book makes a gripping read it also has several weaknesses. For instance it is very much focused on the people involved, constantly introducing new characters and telling bits and pieces about their biography and then suddenly losing them. Mark Sykes becomes a center of attention, gets lost and then we learn that he died of flu in 1919. With others it is just assumed that the reader knows their biographies anyway. Maybe a warning on the cover  \\"Read Churchill first\\" would be called for.<br/>Considering that there is quite an emphasis on German policy towards its ally Turkey we never learn anything about this policy. The same could be said for France. The policy of the Young Turks also is just used as a background for actions taken by some British second-rate-officials but never explained.<br />Overall his is a very interesting and entertaining book, but not a really great one.	2004-04-20

All in all it is just a collection of the public images people who are called major players want to give to a journalist who so addresses them. <br />So if you want any insights into the US government's reactions after 9-11 and the war in Afghanistan this book is a waste of time. The only use for it I can foresee is as a source for silly quotes some future historians might use. Maybe.	2004-03-14

One and not a series.<br />You can see that he had fun researching and writing it and it is a joy reading it. Late 16th century London comes alive and quite often this alternative history and the real one become compared by the protagonists. The sad conclusion, that to survive you have to adapt to the changing times and fight for your life is all too real.<br />Nevertheless it is a funny book, like a movie with swordfights, a happy-end, knighthood and girl for one hero, freedom for the other. The story of the two main characters, Shakespeare and Lope de Vega, is a gripping read. Like almost all his single-volume work must read and buy for all Turtledove fans.	2003-11-24

(BTW: it must be a consortium given the production rate of new books appearing each year under the Turtledove label. Also the distinctly female POV of some scenes make it hard to believe that one man wrote it all. So I guess the master himself writes stand-alone novels and farms out series to his consortium)<br />The book itself is on one hand a gripping description of a country sliding deeper into tyranny and madness. On the other it tries to give its characters a personal life, meaning that its (mostly senior) heroes have sex. Or regret not having sex... <br />Those parts where fundamentally decent people get sucked into a system of evil are fascinating to read and let the reader understand how similar things happened in the Europe of the 1930s. Also the domestic side of appeasement, how hope against hope made bargains with the devil possible, comes to life in this book.<br />Stretching out the story to 30 years (50 if you count How Few Remain) and continuing means that a lot of characters change. The partner in charge of their storyline sometimes discards them and brings in someone new, a relative or descendant of the killed character.<br />F.e. Boston fisherman George Enos was killed and replaced by his wife. Now she is killed (because of bad sex) and replaced by their son, George jr. Such replacements do not always work out well because I suspect that the they do not always fit the writing style of the partner who is in charge of them.<br />I wonder if the names some of the characters bear are a programmatic regarding their fate in the story arc. Scipio, Cassius, Achilles ... the name partner of the consortium is supposed to know his classics. I am really looking forward to the next book(s) to see if their fate follows that of their ancient name-sakes.	2003-11-24

Interesting to read and a credible explanation of the European and American POV of the world since WW2. So Europe thanks to the USA has solved a paradox that baffled Kant and lives in a post-modern age of peace.<br />If only it were so. True, the great wars of the 20th century broke within just 30 years not only the power but also the will of the European nations to intervene abroad. But they also created the will to form the European Union and to live together in peace. <br />This situation is not unique: Canada, Australia and Latin America also view the world that way. The USA (and to a certain degree Russia, who is overlooked in this essay) differs: they get involved. The picture Kagan presents is from a movie like \\"High Noon\\". The sheriff (USA) and the barkeeper in the saloon (Europe): one faces the gang, the other accommodate it and tries to be overlooked.<br />The interesting question will be who survives and who prospers in the future. The USA grows in population and power; the burden of being the sheriff is a relatively small one. Which makes an interesting comparison with the late 19th century when Britain was in a similar situation.<br />Unfortunately Kaman does not discuss the cost-benefit ratio of being the leading power. True, you get lots of enemies and conflicts, but also lots of capital and the best and brightest people from abroad. Britain had to fight \\"Queen Victoria's Little Wars\\" (an excellent book BTW) but she got much in return. The situation the USA finds itself in today looks similar. That the perspective of the other nations (the has-beens) is different is also not exactly news.<br />So in the end Kagan's essay tells us that the USA and Europe see the world differently, that this has in reality been so since WW2 and will continue for the foreseeable future. So what? Big news!  Therefore and since the essence of this essay can be found in a quality paper every other weekend  you need not buy this book to get the message.	2003-09-18

If Japan had taken Hawaii early in WW2 it is not really conceivable that the outcome of the war would have changed, but the history of Hawaii inevitable would have been different from the one we know.<br />This book gives excellent food for thought (pineapples?) about this different history of the isles. The recollections of three generations of Hawaiian-Japanese, newspaper-like reports and university lectures from the (different) future all together paint a picture that is entirely believable. Since all the events and policies described really happened in Japanese-occupied Asia they are probable too. <br />It could have happened if Japan had taken the isles. That it probably would not have happened as some reviewers complained is besides the point. History would not have happened as we know it, and Hawaii today would be different too. That is the point this book makes. And since the authors kept the book short and focused (no human interest stories, no steamy love scenes, no heroic/stupid politicians) it is utterly enjoyable. Alternative history at its best!	2003-08-02

As a grown-up I realize that he did survive it all because he was the meanest SOB of them all.  A fact he could conveniently forget to tell his biographer Homer because he was the only survivor. And the gods were even worse.<br />So when an alien probe arrives at the university of Chicago and snatches people to send them into the realm of Greek mythology most quickly reappear dead. Except for one group who manages to survive and boy, do they really have adventures to tell.<br />The experience of living in South Africa probably shaped  the humor of Dave Freer in a way similar to that of Tom Sharpe: the world is crazy, people are crazy, so do not worry but go on living. And do not mind the gods, they are crazy too.<br />The book is an ongoing joke, funny and not to be taken seriously. People who know the Greek mythology will appreciate the lighter view at it. The excursion to Egypt and its gods was unnecessary and could have waited for the next book. I hope there will be another one because the world is so much better when you can laugh at the gods?	2003-08-02

Not only the question why and how a flash forward is possible, if we live in a predetermined universe or if we can change our fate, but to top it with his vision about the fate of humanity. <br />That last piece was a) totally unnecessary for the rest of the story, but b) left a very stale taste in the mind. In other words: it diminished an excellent book to (just) very good.<br />I observed the same thing in &quot;Calculating God&quot;. If Sawyer just knew when to stop, it would IMHO make his novels so much better. A similar story is told by James Hogan in &quot;Thrice upon a Time&quot; and since it is much more focused, it is a better novel.<br />In this one the potential is there for so much more, but the author overreaches. In a way he was on flash forward too...	2003-07-06

Now all the events of the civil war between Marius and Sulla, but also between Caesar and Pompeius, the third Punic war, the Roman expansion in the east,... can be packed into one generation and one set of protagonists.<br />Part of the fun for the reader is to guess which particular event is played out a little bit different now. This could become a series with the potential for much fun. If the SPQR-series is a yard-stick then there is much to look forward to.<BR>I just hope that Roberts can rein in his enthusiasm for Alexandrian inventions.

Bean Piper. This one gets discovered by a WW2 veteran and VMI graduate who figures that he gave his due to Uncle Sam and starts to create a world to his liking. He collects an assortment of his Army buddies and desperate refugees and creates the Commonwealth of New Virginia.<br />In his Islander series Stirling had a group of Americans in a new world who choose careful cooperation as their way of dealing with its inhabitants. In The Peshawar Lancers it was integration, the English refugees became one more caste in their Indian empire. In this novel the colonialists, supported by their secret paratime-gate, can afford to create a dreamland.<br />A colony that avoids the mistakes made by the imperialists since 1700 and so creates a paradise for great white hunters, a utopian Rhodesia with a small population, lots of big game and a perfect California weather. No underclass or slaves since they have modern machinery and keep their Mexican Gastarbeiter on strict time-contracts. A world with no problems, unspoiled and beautiful, almost perfect.<br />Now if one thinks about it the catch becomes obvious very soon. A world like this could only work with a paratime-gate through which it exports minerals and imports technology. Without the gate everything would change, especially the perspective of the ruling class, the so-called 30 families. Now I wonder if there will be a sequel<br />Taking aside all that the novel is just great fun to read, an enchanting escape from reality. Only towards the end, when the four heroes went out to fight for this land, not at the OK coral but close, it becomes a bit silly. First through the dessert, fighting Indians, storming and shooting up an enemy camp and army, shooting down their planes  A bit much for so few people and pages. Maybe a little less action towards the end would have made it a better book. After all on the last few pages tell a few great jokes without a gunfight<br />At first I did not want to buy this book because I was disappointed that it was not a sequel to The Peshawar Lancers but some of the Amazon reviews awoke my curiosity. Now, on one hand I am glad that Stirling does not do a Turtledove by expanding every book into never-ending series; on the other I really would like to read a sequel one day. But then he will probably write something new, something even better. I guess I just have to keep on buying them.	2003-05-12

And at the first glance it is very interesting to read as well.<br />Mr. Ferguson starts with personal memories and then develops a theory, which as usual for him is against the current established opinion: The empire was a good thing (gasp!). From then on he races and jumps through British history from the 16th century to the 20th and never stops to take a breath.<br />That way the American Revolution becomes a four-page-anecdote, about the same space reserved for the life of the author of Amazing Grace. It is an interesting detail to learn that this man in earlier life was the master of a slave-ship, but is it really relevant to the history and meaning of the empire?<br />The book oozes Television Series from every page: colorful pictures, fast pace, more ore less meaningless information bites and quick jumps from one continent and one century to the other. At the end of the book one is baffled: already over? And just because it became a net drain within less than one generation? Or because the Boer War was the Vietnam of its age? Come on!<br />Something is missing here : a theory, arguments, research. It is (mostly) lacking, instead this book provides good entertainment and the linkage with other books.

Likewise the Prussian general staff got a reputation for perfect planning while in the field the army operated by chaotic requisition. The Schlieffen plan was unworkable from the start, Patton won by stealing from his neighbor units and ignoring the supply bureaucrats and Rommel overextended himself without a chance of winning ...<br />Interesting perspectives that give lot of food for thought - even if they may be somewhat biased. For example when Creveldt blames the German general stuff for not preparing the Russian campaign properly he claims that Hitler ´s decisions made sense .... <br />It is a pity that the book stops in 1944; Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf war would be very interesting by comparison.	2003-01-31

Lets face it  this book would need more editing, badly! Or even better: divide the book in three, because there is a very interesting story here.<br />How do you (re-)start a war?  Let over-ambitious, weak politicians play their game till they fail and then you have it, because for them to admit their mistake is worse to other people dying. It works splendidly  just look at Europe and the start of WW. This part of the book is very nicely done even if it stretches out quite a bit.<br />Some reviewers complained about too many meetings and other boring stuff  yes, the storyline could be much clearer, but in essence it is very powerful already. Only  and that is probably unforgivable for hardcore Honor-fans  there is no Honor in it. She is not involved in this particular story.<br />Her adventures in Silesia and the tension with the Andies are also a good tale, about average for a Honor story. As for the lot of small stories (f.e. that of Captain Bachfisch)  was it really necessary. Was there a clause in Mr. Weber`s contract that this novel absolutely had to have over 850 pages?<br />Big, fat novels like this one make a uncomfortable read  parts of it are so interesting that they go down like honey, others stretch out with nothing happening that they are like forced eating. How about sliming down? Just for comparison: Flag in Exile told a very gripping story  with 443 pages.	2003-01-21

The rulers of Europe should ponder this question since they got a lot of Grantville's history books but their reaction varies a lot: Richelieu understands the future importance of colonial possessions in America and shifts France's quest for expansion there - but also makes sure that the other European powers get even more occupied in European wars.<br />In England Charles I tries to avoid the revolution and goes by the book by incarcerating (the still unknown) Cromwell, maintaining good advisers and not pursuing alienating religious policies. But the man's character remains as it is: his policies create new problems and he is astonished that they were not in the book ...<br />This is a totally different book than \\"1632\\" - that was a classic time-traveler tale with lots of battles decided by modern weapons and modern ideals descending from the future on a world that needed them. \\"1632\\" was a nicely crafted tale of that kind with blue-collar heroes and ethics trying to save Germany from the hell of the 30years War.<br />But what happens to the angels after the descend from heaven? Or rather, what happens after the modern weapons are spent and the ideas confront the realities of totally different circumstances? Well, in this book Eric Flint and ( I guess to a larger degree ) David Weber try to find answers and rebuild from the scratch: a storyline and civilization.<br />The result is a remarkable book that will be capable to support lots of sequels and byline stories from different authors. This book can and hopefully will be the beginning of a great series.<br />Some reviewers criticized that there is not enough action, that some characters don't get as much attention as in \\"1632\\" - so what? A world was built here where there is a lot of space for many action-packed battle stories and really good alternative history as well.<br />I am glad that I bought the book after all even though I had my doubts after Flint's \\"Tyrant\\", but a few of the reviews made me curious. Now I want sequels. Many and soon.	2002-10-16

Having read all of the Uplift novels I have a distinct mental picture of the relevant alien races and I guess that is true for most of the fans.<br />For someone who doesn't know the novels this book must be quite bewildering - especially because of the pictures.

M. Stirling's story about a hunting party in an America after the fall described in his \\"Peshawar Lancers\\" universe is a somewhat odd mixture of post-nuclear expedition a la \\"The Postman\\", a western revenge movie and gothic horror-story. A good summer read.<br />Mary Gentle's story is the low point of the book: it gives the distinct impression of something put together from earlier, discarded material just to meet a deadline. It is unclear to the end what the story really is about and as a teaser or introduction into the \\"Ash\\" universe it fails miserably.<br />But the book as a whole is saved by its last piece: William's story about Nietsche in Tombstone is a rare gem. Crazy and funny (imagine: Nietsche as a gunman and gambler!), but still accurate. Just great.<br />My opinion about the book: the stories have nothing in common beyond the fact that they are all taking place in alternate histories. That wouldn't be a problem in a bigger anthology or in a magazine, but for a hardcover with just four stories it adds up to too expensive. So read it, but don't buy.	2002-09-12

Hardcore Hiaasen fans probably will ask themselves if next he'll admit to actually liking Disney World ...<br />Almost all characters are likeable, with the exception of some people on the fringes of (post?)

But still, it damages one's social life if on learning someone's age the famous people who died at that particular age become the topic of conversation.

Considering how much Turtledove publishes, the man must work without stop or sleep - and it shows in the writing. But, oh what great stories he has to tell!<br />This book is set in a universe were the South won the civil war (and the next one), but lost the Great War - a story told (sometimes ad nauseam) in 4 books so far. Ten years, 1924 till 1934, are covered: the recession and subsequent rise of a Nazi-style party in the South are the main topic.<br />In typical Turtledove-style a lot of characters tell their stories, add their perspective to a fascinating picture. Some of them are IMHO useless, some should be killed of (one is) ... and on top of it all, the book could do better with 100 pages less. But I repeat: the style of writing and the details of this book may be bad or tiresome - the overall result is not.<br />Turtledove manages to give a very good impression of what life was like in a defeated, impoverished country with discredited elites. Show the conditions that made possible the rise of authoritarian regimes all over Europe in the 20s and 30s - in this book it is the South. <br />Now I wonder if it is just a coincidence, that the Hitler-like Jake Featherstone begins his radio addresses with the statement \\"I am going to tell you the truth\\". Are the not some talk radio hosts who use similar phrases?<br />What makes this book more interesting than the last one from the series is that while it's alternate universe remains close to the real one, it gets more history of it's own: f.e. Japan and the USA already clash in 1932.<br />All things considered this is a great read for those already familiar with the series. For me a toss-up between three or four stars. And I'll give Turtledove the benefit of doubt and also look forward to the next installment. But shorter, please!	2002-09-03

David Herrmann has written an outstanding book: showing the ten years before the Great War as a period of miscalculations and misconceptions by diplomats, military and political leadership. All leading to a situation when diplomatic triumph was the preferred, diplomatic defeat the unacceptable outcome - and actual war the second choice. So, naturally ...<br />But still it is mainly a book about the land armies of the European powers. Their strengths and weaknesses, the way they try to adapt to the new technologies and get the money for them. It is not an in-depth comparison of various weapon-system or tactics, but rather an n account of the way other armies judged their rivals. Were they perceived as threats or as negliable quantities and what was the outcome of such perceptions.<br />From the first Morocco crisis to the Balkan Wars the crisis of this decade influenced the military and the political class of Europe. Since the book included archive material from all powers (Austria gets very often overlooked) it gives the whole picture. What it omits is the naval race.<br />Admittedly the battleship race had - the money aside - no influence on the land armies and for the sake of shortness it is acceptable to barely mention it. Nevertheless it played an important role concerning the decline of relations between Germany and England, but there are lots of good books on that subject.<br />What IMHO would have improved the book: a bit about the logistic aspects and feasibility of the various war plans. Martin Van Creveld´s \\"Supplying War\\" showed the folly that was the Schliefen plan from this angle. That it omits this aspect of war - about which the contemporaries were well aware - is the only qualm I have with this book.<br />For the land armies, as an overview of the situation during the countdown to the Great War this short book is just brilliant!	2002-08-12

I guess I expected a book that did what the author promised to do in its first chapter: look at greed as a driving force in our (Western) civilization. The \\"grand acquisitors\\" who ignore old rules, conquer and build empires, create misery but also progress.<br />Well I have to look for other books for that story. Here there are only some rambling about the wicked deeds of arbitrary chosen representatives throughout history. Is Agrippina all there is to say about Rome? She was no grand acqisitor at all, and Rome had many of them. <br />What also infuriated me was the way religion is presented here. It is the \\"Oh yes, there was this nice man with good ideas. But of course he never said he was a prophet (or even the son of God). And his followers who built churches were the most wicked bunch ...\\" style. Moral values with a religious support are ridiculed and discarded by reference to church-supported cruelties and errors.<br />Instead the author loves one man: Solon. He is the father of all good - democracy and sovereignty of and by the people. That his order didn't last even one generation and that he himself went into exile rather than to work for his brainchild is not mentioned here. And I rather doubt that the framers of America's constitution had only Solon to guide them. What about all those Romans who created the rule of law?<br />So in the end this book is not just bad but a waste. The greed is there (after all the people making it must have had some motivation), but there is no power at all!	2002-08-11

If I have one objection and therefore won't give it five stars it's that at the end Sawyer cheats.<br />In the book he mentions Carl Sagan and his novel \\"Contact\\" with its somewhat similar theme. Well, Sawyer fails by that standard. Because the end he wrote an oh-so-nice end solving it all: God, cancer, the works. <br />Some things are best left unexplained and in the realm of believe. To do otherwise is risky - the end of this novel is not up to the standard of its main body. It looks like a desperate search for a miracle - like cheating.	2002-08-11

But they still feel marginalized, full of rage and suspicion, isolated within their professional communities.<br />They distrust the liberals, but for historical reasons cannot trust the conservatives - or those among them who convert to the conservative cause. The father of the narrator - a Clarence-Thomas-like judge - did and was subsequently embroiled in a confirmation battle that destroyed his reputation and his family.<br />His death means trouble for his son; a lot of people want to know about the \\"arrangements\\" of the dead judge. They are a riddle - a chess problem with a hidden message - and they mean trouble. As if the hero had not enough of that already: with his ambitious but unfaithful wife, at his university, with his family history and his life in general.<br />The story is fascinating as a glimpse into life on the Gold Coast, but it rather fails as a mystery. The narrator cheats, because he discovers something, acts and then tells the reader two or three chapters later what and when he found out. Besides: the plot is either too arcane - the big conspiracy that involves them all: liberals and conservatives - or too obvious and sometimes facilitating between those extremes<br />Still: this is a book to be recommended.	2002-08-05

Tragic circumstances - his former mentor's loss of memory - open up an unusual opportunity for our hero: to become an Imperial auditor. To quote from the book: \\"imperial with capital imp\\".<br />So the book becomes a mystery with Miles as the investigator and - naturally - his cousin Ivan as the sidekick. And it is a great story with all the colorful, romantic background of Barrayar.<br />If \\"Mirror Dance\\" was the very dark but brilliant story about his clone-brother becoming Lord Mark, then this is Miles' turn to really become Lord Vorkossigan, new suite and kitchen-staff included. There is also romance in the book, but it mostly evades Miles - well, at least the emperor is happy ...<br />A mystery, romance, a search for oneself - it's all there in this book. I regard it as one of the best of this brilliant series. To read it before \\"Komarr\\" (and consequently \\"A Civil Campaign\\") is recommended.	2002-07-03

After the absolutely stupid and misleading cover of the latest installment of the Bellisarius-series the people at Baen Books have done it again: putting a Xena-style (lightly clad) female warrior on front. So what about the content?<br />Eric Flint has achieved an almost complete break with the storyline of \\"The Reformer\\", but has it improved the book? But compared with S.M. Stirling's handling of the same scenario Eric Flint's novel just bombs! <br />The theme developed in The General-series by Drake/Stirling was the salvation of the remaining civilization on an isolated world by a computer and its chosen man.<br />In the original series this was on a world with a situation like the Mediterranean in 500AD, so the main hero was the Byzantine general Belliasrius a.k.a. Raj Whitehall. In the first follow-on novel \\"The Chosen\\" it was a new world with an early 20th century setting and in the second it was first century BC Rome. The computer's chosen man was a (Greek) philosopher and his mission the prevention of imperial decline.<br />Apparently Eric Flint had other ideas about what kind of story he wanted to tell: his main character is now a Roman who wants to seize absolute power to destroy the existing corrupt order. The \\"Reformer\\" from the latest book is just one of his instruments (with the voices of the computer and Whitehall in his brain), like all other members of his family.<br />The real problem with the book is that it apparently wants to achieve so much - explain Rome's decline and offer an alternative like jump-starting to the middle ages and industrial revolution at the same time - but looses sight of a readable story. Sometimes it seems as if the characters are reduced to their sex life ... . So it may well be that the artist creating the cover was not so far of ...<br />It is a sad ending for a great series.

Well, that may still be so but now I discovered what a brilliant book this is.<br />It's subject is not only the campaign Miles wages to capture Ekaterine's heart and hand, there is much more: sub-plots and stories about Mark, Ivan, a count's succession struggle, the Imperial wedding ... It's just a great panorama of Barrayar: colorful, full of suspense and romance.<br />Oh, and then this is probably the funniest Vorkossigan book of them all. Some of the scenes are just hilarious! Some are almost too much: the scene when Miles gets his Ekaterin could be from a Frank-Capra-movie.<br />My advice: buy it, read it, enjoy it!	2002-06-10

In his introduction he points out that he is writing for a larger audience, not just for the law crowd. That was the intention but the result is a book neither fish nor fowl.<br />While chapter 1 is very interesting with his observation about the nature of representative democracy, from there on the book declines.<br />Chapter 2 tries to establish facts about the Florida vote and therefore gets lost in statistical limbo. In chapter 3 he mentions the most important decisions by the courts but this is more a comment not an analysis.<br />In chapter 4 he judges the performance of the players: the courts, the attorneys and the law professors in the media. Finally in chapter 5 he writes about consequences and proposes some reforms while at the same time admitting that they are politically unrealistic.<br />So what was this book about? After all he observes correctly in chapter 1 that elections are political and continues to recognize that the practice of constitutional law is as well. While I agree with most of his opinions about the players in the Florida election farce that is not why I bought this book.<br />I was expecting a thorough analysis of the legal questions involved.

But being a bystander when that happens is very uncomfortable: for Miles, Barrayar and the quaddies.<br />To enjoy this novel one has to be familiar with the worlds and peoples of the nexus - having read especially \\"Falling Free\\" and \\"Cetaganda\\" helps a lot. <br />In a subtitle on the jack's inside this book is called \\"A Comedy of Terrors\\". Well, those two don't mix so well in the first place and there isn't enough comedy to make the reader laugh. Miles (or Mark) as the underdog, the outsider against the system and/or old prejudices - there one finds bittersweet humor. <br />In this book, with Miles as august lord auditor in an outsider's world, that doesn't work. The book also lacks the romance that so nicely balanced the mystery in \\"Komarr\\" or the self-search from \\"Mirror Dance\\" and \\"Memory\\". So while it may not be among the best Vorkossigan-novels it's just a very good one. <br />PS: So where is Iwan? Being Miles´ loyal sidekick (and suffering for it) through most Vorkossigan books has he got a vacation? Or a life of his own?	2002-05-16

Marx thought he had it all figured out - and those who came after him tried to fix past, present and future so that it would fit his projections. The heroine of this book, a black female named Sarah Beaumont, discovers by change the traces of a secret society, operating since the early 19th century who invented a science called \\"Cliology\\" and try to manipulate the development of history (for the common good, of course, but getting rich, unavoidably).<br />The scenario evokes Asimov´s classic \\"Foundation\\" trilogy, the art of predicting the future to be practiced by a foundation, guarded in secret by a second one ... . Only this time it is today's earth, not the fringes of the galaxy, where all this happens.<br />Since there is no psychohistory a.k.a. cliology (or whatever you'd like to call it) the author's imagination had to come up with a few scenarios. All those people, trying to shape the future, who didn't succeed but as a consolation prize got rich by it. Well, it was a miracle, but after all this is a novel about magicians who lost control over their creation ... .<br />This book was written before \\"Firestar\\" and its sequels, where one can find the same leitmotif: trying to change the future so that Armageddon can be avoided. But in this book a coherent story-arc is lacking, and badly so.<br />Beside Sarah there are too many major characters, too many sub-plots and plotters. And it all ends with a shoot-out. In San Francisco. On the Coit Tower. Right. <br />So all in all the book rather disappoints. With better editing it could have been so much better. Considering that it is a slightly altered re-issue one wonders:  would more radical rewriting have produced a great book? Lets do some cliology...	2002-05-13

Now, more than a decade later, the author re-wrote it in a way that makes me suspect that he liked \\"Contact\\" - the movie with Jodie Foster - a lot. <br />The story itself changed only a little but the surrounding world ... . The original THT had the cold war feeling of paranoia and priorities, politicians playing for global survival with implied threats and unspoken hopes. This new THT is taking place in a world of US hegemony - little threats but no hopes.<br />In the original the various heroes act within their characters: fanatical, timid, bureaucratic, lovingly ... Harry Carmichael acts against orders but he doesn´t go to the President´s face to tell him so and offer him a Clintonesque way out ...<br />The times they are changing, but still it would have been better if Jack McDevitt would have left the original text unchanged. Even the future has a past- and a lot of good scifi novels are products of their age - and one should respect the past and not try to alter or reinterpret it. This way a great novel (5 stars)became just a very good (4  stars) one.<br />As for the second novel - \\"A Talent for War\\" - the title is very hard to understand till one has finished the book and then it doesn´t really fit. Overall it is vintage McDevitt: a man searching for clues and the truth, a voyage, danger and adventures. All of it very slowly evolving and sucking the reader in so that he has to finish it. When I closed the last page it was half past one in the morning - but it was worth it.<br />So my overall judgment: a great book, but if you can get \\"The Hercules Text\\" in the original version buy that instead.	2002-05-01

Interesting: whenever Americans get lost in time they try to recreate the United States. No matter if it´s the bronze age as with Stirling´s Islanders or the Germany of the 30-years-war as in this book. But the if there ever was a place and age that required a beacon of light and the hope to exercise one´s  fundamental rights - life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness - it was Germany in 1632.<br />The characters are colourful and the humour is rich. For example the story who really wrote Shakespeare´s plays but did not pay his doctor´s bills .... . Well, lets just say that the book likes to tell little tales about divine justice.<br />The Grantville heroes have a blue-collar spirit and attitude, but then there is Gustavus Adolphus ... . IMHO Eric Flint makes him a bit too much of a saviour/hero - and at the same time Wallenstein and Richelieu villains, who were in many ways men ahead of their time and age.<br />So the mix of not-quite-historical people with Flint´s West Virginians and its results is colourful, but very much wishful thinking. But then so is all alternative fiction. Here we get it all: suspense and romance, history and scifi, politics and humor.<br />With this book Eric Flint has established himself - ,together with S.M Stirling - as the master of colourful story-driven alternative history. The latest novels by that other master Harry Turtledove are much more like a reporter´s account from a somewhat different history . History-driven instead of story-driven, which makes them somewhat less enjoyable to read because they almost beg to be taken seriously.<br />However with this book it is the story, the eternal values that make it such an enjoyable read and make me to eagerly wait for the sequel. It will be interesting to see if Flint continues as in the Belisarius-series with endless battles and an almost super-human hero, or if he takes the approach of Stirling´s Islander series with a bit of fast forward in time and new central heroes.<br/>It will be also be very interesting to see how Flint continued Stirling´s Reformer\\" in the upcoming Tyrant\\". Some good books are coming soon ...	2002-04-08

And in this world the usual happens: handsome hero - officer, of course - with his loyal armsman, sinister plot, evil magic, damsel in distress, noble sister, charming prince, martyred king ... . It is India as imagined by Kipling and others. <br />But then it is a somewhat different world - alternative history at its best. The scenario of the cosmic impact that almost destroys civilisation in 1878 and forces Britain´s elites to seek survival and continuation of their rule in India is credible and plausible. It is also well crafted and described in the book´s excellent annex.<br />A strange world, with no Otto- but Stirling-motors; airships but no aeroplanes and no computers but just one big mechanical calculator - the pride of the Empire ... . Oh, and the world is saved by one - later all - of the Peshawar Lancers ...<br />S.M. Stirling has repeated the stroke of genius he already had by creating his Islander-series. I just hope that he´ll continue the storyline of this book in a similar way - with other heroes and places from this strange new world.	2002-03-17

No this is a work of - to borrow a title from Niall Ferguson - virtual history. A battle was lost, or won - depending on the POV.<br />And since in this book Saratoga was won by the British the American Revolution in fact ends but history continues. Only somewhat different ... The book tells the history of the 200 years following in this changed world. Some things never change, but for others the old proverb that is the title of this book seems true.<br />The only problem I have with it is that it is too ambitious - wanting to tell a world history with emphasis on North America in some detail - and therefore needing 450 pages! After some time it becomes tiresome. <br />The best works of alternative history keep the virtual history, the background of their novels, short but insert it as by-the-way tales once so often. One of the best examples for that is The Two Georges\\". This book is virtual history pure. Very interesting and entertaining for someone knowledgeable in actual history. But a bore or worse for someone who is not.	2002-02-28

From Alexander the Great to Hitler the imperialistic ambitions of peoples - manifested through their leaders - of the various ages get set into a context so that the reader can see the similarities and differences between them. <br />However one should keep in mind that the book is not focused so much on events like battles and proclamations of empires but rather on the underlying ideology of the time - why peoples wanted an empire and why they supported \\"their\\" heroes and villains seeking to establish them and overlooked how they did it.<br />Where the book is open to criticism is a) the rather offhanded way it deals with religion as a motivation for Empire - the 1000 years of the middle ages get hardly a mentioning in comparison with others - and b) that it mostly omits non-West-European empires. <br />But on the other hand some sacrifices had to be made for brevity and clarity. I consider it a toss-up between a 4- and a 5-star book. For a knowledgeable reader well-versed in history it is nothing new, hence 4-stars, but for someone who wants to understand history´s great trends and needs an introduction its 5-stars.	2002-02-05

We learn about Daniel Leary´s  skills in sailing  the matrix and Adele Mundy´s in retrieving data from enemies, but they don´t have to face their nightmares and find inner strength like in With the Lightnings\\".<br />The plot is without much depth, its basically the two heroes going on with their business.  A lot of potentially interesting sub-plots get started but somehow get lost. The story ark seems to evolve slowly but then ends with a quick bang as if the author had to speed up to meet a time-table.<br />But again: good yarn. Easy reading for a long flight or after-work hours. And with the characters of Leary &amp; Mundy  the potential for a great series is there. I´ll look forward for the next book.	2002-01-07

The first part of the book, dealing with the Ottoman Empire´s reaction to Napoleon´s aggression, the British and Russian response to it and the policy in the subsequent decades f.e. dealing with the Egyptian challenge is excellent. <br />But what is lacking then is a description of the reasons and effects of Turkey´s being the sick man of Europe. The entry of Turkey into the Great War is reduced to just a recount of the statements  of its foolish imperialist leaders and their European vis-a-vis. The events and effects of the war remain background shadows at best.<br />What becomes the main focus of the books second half is the Hashemite family´s quest for an empire, any empire, and the English and French response to it that has shaped today´s Middle East. <br />The book is definitely well researched and challenges the established (T.E. Lawrence et. al.) history of the events in Arabia during and after the Great War, however that is also its weakness. It does not give a thorough overview of the Ottoman Empire´s policy and decline - it is an argument of a new and particular of (parts of) the history of the region between 1789 and 1922. But it is not suitable as an introductory book into the history and policy of that time and area.	2001-12-04

All those spotlight reports from all over the world make the reader realise what is happening at nearly the same moment in time: the establishment of a new dynasty's rule in China, the overthrow of the Stuarts in England, the departure of a Viceroy from Mexico ... Those are fascinating reports from 300 years ago, all with stories about individual people who left records: a nun in New Spain, a poet in Japan, a Jewish widow in Hamburg, a captured Turkish slave in the Balkans ... All those fates, all those stories make the reader want to learn more. Alas, this won't happen in this book. It is just a temptation to read other books, but not good history as such. For that it lacks a coherent structure; there is no theme beside the year 1688. Also there are too many white spots on the globe presented here. So not realy good history, but nevertheless a great book to be recomended!	2001-08-24

The book captures the reality of post-WW1 Europe, the feeling that the old order was slain on the battlefield, the \\"half generation\\" guilt of the survivors, hyperinflation, social and political - all of it happening the America of Turtledove´s Great-War universe.<br />Those of his heroes who survived the slaughter are trying to find and keep peace,  but some are seeking revenge. Anyway Turtledove does a great job of capturing  the Weimar republic´s state of mind and Britain´s lost generation blues and making it available to today´s reader.<br />One reason I don´t rate this fife stars is that you can only appreciate the character´s development if one has read the entire Great War series. It was a good decision to finish it with the third book, even if the sudden change of pace made the third book somewhat look like a Reader´s Digest novel. But maybe this book would be even better if new characters were its heroes. How Few Remain\\" is a good example.  <br />One reviewer has criticised that we learn hardly anything about the state of the rest of the world, I concur. What is also missing  so far are prohibition and organised crime - those ingredients would make the further developments very interesting indeed. But we´ll see.	2001-08-20

Except for a whaffle (Clinton) or a cowboy hat (George W.). Now in case of Duke (who is fiction) one can see his political message speaking from the man´s brain: Mini-D brings us a message of compassionate fascism. Does this mean that we can see fiction clearer that the real people in political life?<br />The campaign 2000 was so much of a (life) cartoon itself that any (drawn) cartoon can only pale beside it. Anyway, this newest book in the &quot;Doonesbury&quot;-saga is only part one of things to come in Duke´s presidental quest. The strip has become very bitter compared to its heydays in the70s and 80s.

I ´ve read all the books of Drake/Flint´s Bellisarius-series so far and like them a lot. It´s just that the story becomes drawn out with so many sub-plots and -stories. The upcomming sixth book hopefully will conclude the story arc - but IMHOP four books would have done the job.<br />This book itself is well written,  the characters are known even if there is some fluctuation: one major killed , a few new introduced. However for someone who doesn´t know the story so far the book must be an enigma: there is this Roman General Bellisarius, who must be mad because he talks with some inner voice and ponders American Civil War decisions while campaigning in India.... <br />Sounds crazy, reads crazy and then there is a book cover that crys SWORDS! SEX! EPLOSIONS! Please! Was this really necessary? This is a book of alternate history and is by and large meant to be serious. So why did the publishers burden it with this cover? Do they worry that because of the lenght of the series the readers might abandon it and know want to gain a new, somewhat different audience?	2001-08-11

But they also leave behind a genetic trail: the descendends of conquerors and dreamers who the former mother country forgot or never acknowledged in the first place,<br />This excellent book visits six of those lost white tribes. Their history is sometimes bizarre (Confederates in Brazil), sad (Poles in Haiti) or just  a tale out of a time gone by since centurys (Dutch in Sri Lanka). The six storys vary in their mixture of the author´s account of his search for and visit with the lost tribes and the history of those people. The quality of the information is somewhat uneven. One sad impression is universal in all the six tales: the tribes discribed are not only forgotten, but will very soon cease to exist.<br />However this still is a very interesting, fascinatig to read book.	2001-08-05

This book is neither a Turtledove-style alternative-history-novel, nor a  &quot;Virtual History&quot; speculation by Niall Ferguson, but a collection of after-dinner mind-games. Pieces from American history with a short speculative &quot;what if?&quot; tale added for spice. Their style is that of a journalist´s report, not that of a historian or novelist. This makes for easy reading, perhaps suitable for a transatlantic flight but not something to spend too much time on.<br />What is really lacking is a uniform approach to the historical sitations and subsequent speculation reported. Sometimes those are inconsequential  to the further progress of history, then they are turning points which change everything. Why, the reader won´t learn.

This book is a nice little tale about early Ireland and the Europe of the late Roman / Early Middle Ages. We get to know lots about Irish mythology, heroic tales, sexual attitudes etc. Also this book overflows with Latin quotations and the such. What is missing is the story promissed in the title: how the Irish saved civilisation.<br />It tells us how the Irish got letters and Christianity, practising both with the zeal of the newly-converted. The story of the Irish missionarys on the continent gets a glance at best, as a background to the tale of some very colorful Irish madmen (? / saints?).<br />The tale the author promises in the title could be there, even if it remains doubtful if the Irish monks could be credided with saving  (Christian) civilisation. What about Cyrill and Method? And even Cahill acknoledges that there were missionarys from other  parts of the (western, Latin) Christian world as well. Unfortunately he won´t discuss it in this book.<br />Less Irish tales would have been helpful. This way the book remains faithful to its subtitle: The Untold Story ... . It remains untold.	2001-07-19

An alternative history with both East &amp; West Rome still existing in the 7th century AD, with foederati states on the edges and an ancient foe - Persia - in the east: it looked good. I didnt exactly expect a masterpiece like Turtledoves &quot;Agent of Byzantium&quot; but  neither was I prepared for a non-story. The book lacks a coherent storyline, credible characters who act instead of brooding over a fire, and - worst! - any explanation how this alternative to the actual history came into being.

So  I was very pleased when I found this book in a small bookshop in Port  Beaufort, SC.  This is it - the South: a cartoon. Especially The Rev. Will  B. Dunne is a character so good he must be true. But the he is a cartoon,  isnt he?	2000-08-17
