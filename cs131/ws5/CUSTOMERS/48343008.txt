As part of his study, he explains why the income tax, although partially successful in paying for the war, should have been expanded further during the conflict to prevent the economic misfortunes that beset the government at the conclusion of the war. <br /> <br />Minimal attention is given to taxation or economic policies during the Grant administration, and Presidents Hayes, Garfield and Arthur are hardly mentioned at all.  McKinley & Roosevelt are the topics of the next major section of the book, where Weisman does a great job of explaining how McKinley's programs transitioned into the Progressive income tax reforms introduced by Theodore Roosevelt. <br /> <br />The congressional battles over the tax, along with the involvement of the Supreme Court (in fact, the court invalidated the income tax in 1895), makes the book very interesting reading, as the author gives the reader a comprehensive picture of the relationship between the three branches of government as related to taxation. <br /> <br />Weisman continues to provide a comprehensive picture of taxation up through the first world war and the Wilson administration, with an epilogue that takes us up to the current day. <br /> <br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has the slightest interest in economic, political, or taxation history of America.	2005-07-23

McCullough pays this act virtually no attention, as he is focused on the people and the military activities of the year. <br /> <br />With plenty of attention to His Excellency General George Washington based on first-hand accounts of the time, we see this one year of the revolution through the people's eyes - not just the military tactics or campaign rhetoric, but the way the people felt about the battles and how their emotions swung from dejection to euphoria depending upon the progress (or regress) of the military operations. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book tremendously, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an account of the military doings of this year as seen by the participants.	2005-07-09

Quite honestly, I think that Miller spends a little too much time on the Wilson years, since this book is supposed to be a history of the twenties, but the background information is solid & necessary for a good understanding of the decade following. <br /> <br />Miller gives us nice brief biographical portaits of some of the people that \\"made the news\\" in the 20's - Al Capone, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Charles Lindbergh, and Louis Armstrong.  The collection of characters seen in the pages of the work help to explain the breadth of the book, although it was not an overly deep work (as expected in a book of just under 400 pages). <br /> <br />Overall, for anyone that is looking for a basic understanding of the decade, I would highly recommend this book.  Needles to say, hundreds of the topics covered within the pages of this work could be easily expanded into individual works, so don't expect an all-encompassing thorough history in this volume - just sit back, enjoy the ride, and witness the 20's from 10,000 feet.	2005-06-23

This book is primarily devoted to those years, although it is a brief book for covering such a lengthy period of time for such a powerful member of the United States Government. <br /> <br />Linda Greenhouse, a well respected journalist who has covered the Supreme Court for years has brought us a tale of Harry Blackmun, from his roots in Minnesota to death in 1999 after 24 years as a member of the Supreme Court. <br /> <br />Although Blackmun is best known for the opinion he wrote in the abortion case Roe v. Wade (1973), he was a well-versed justice, covering topics from abortion to free speech to capital punishment.  Greenhouse describes for us how Blackmun evolved from one school of thinking (primarily a moderately conservative viewpoint) to a different school of thought on the ideological spectrum.  In fact, by the time of his retirement, in 1994, Blackmun was considered by many the most liberal member of the court. She tells us this tale by examining his personal papers and the cases that he worked on.  Greenhouse also details for us the breakup of a lifelong friendship between Blackmun and his so-called \\"Minnesota Twin\\", Chief Justice Warren Burger. <br /> <br />Greenhouse does a fabulous job of describing Justice Blackmun and his thought process, how he related to other members of the court, and how he truly became the well-respected Mr. Justice Blackmun, who served with distinction on the US Supreme Court.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the personalities or the internal workings of the highest court in the land.	2005-05-27

What I did not hear, however, was the story of the women who went off to war - this book helps to tell that tale. <br /> <br />Although focused almost exclusively on the European Theater of Operations (only a few pages are devoted at the start and the end of the book to the war in the Pacific), this book gives the reader a good look at the women who were on the front lines of battle as army nurses.  It does not, however, stop with the tales of the nurses themselves; it tells of the doctors and other medical staff members and the gut-wrenching details of some of the injuries sustained and treated by these medical staffers.  More importantly, the book places the nurses and hospital staff right in the thick of the battle by explaining, in vivid detail, the military operations that were ongoing that led to the casualties that these health professionals were trying so hard to save. <br /> <br />If I could change one thing, I would probably ask the authors to include more detail on the nurses and medical staff in the Pacific or to write a complementary volume detailing those activities on the other side of the globe.  That said, I must heartily recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in combat and what goes on just behind the front lines - this is almost like M*A*S*H* in real life.  Read it and be amazed!	2005-05-19

The name of the book is derived from the address of the Santa Fe office of the Manhattan project, and the book focuses on the story of the person in that office, the scientists and their famlies living in Los Alamos.    This is not a dry story about the building of the atomic bomb, it does not delve into theoretical physics or the details about the \\"anatomy\\" of the bomb itself - it is, instead, a story about the people who built the bomb, their families, and adjunct personnel that played an important part in the Manhattan Project.    We are introduced to important, although previously virtually unknown, people like Dorothy McKibbin, who was the individual responsible for manning the Santa Fe office of the Manhattan Project (located at 109 East Palace).  Her story comes to life in this book, and the vital role she played in the project to build the bomb is well explained.  We are also treated to the story of Robert Oppenheimer the person, not the physicist - it is enjoyable to see what kind of person he was, how he interacted with other project members, and what he did to further this great and noble project.  We also see the individual relationships develop between project members, culminating in the disbursement of those members to all corners of the USA after the war ended.    For me, I found the story of the living arrangments, which Conant skillfully weaved within the stories of the people, at Los Alamos to be the most interesting.  To think that these physicists and other essential members of the project team were housed in something akin to a prison camp, and that such a veil of secrecy was forced upon them as to require assumed identities whenever they went out in public, is amazing.    I would have given the book 5 stars, but for the fact that the last 50 pages or so expanded outside the reach of the original project, anddid not feel as though they belonged.  In my opinion, the book would have been remarkable had it ended with a swift culmination after the bomb was dropped and the project ended, rather than going on to the revocation of Oppie's security clearance and the deaths of Oppenheimer, his wife, and daughter.    Overall, I would highly recommend the book to anyone looking for a good assessment of wartime Los Alamos, or to get a basic understanding of Robert Oppenheimer the man.	2005-05-06
US	48343008	R2BUMVQIC6QGP7	0140246967	501983138	Touched with Fire: The Land War in the South Pacific	Books	5	14	14	N	N	A different kind of military history	I previously believed that military history is primarily composed of the battles, the strategies used in the battles, & the leaders of the troops, with stories about individual soldiers mixed in to promote a better sense of understanding about the battle or war.    After reading Eric Bergerud's book Touched With Fire, I now must add another component to that definition of military history - the theatre in which the battle or war was fought.  People think of the European Theatre in World War II, they think of the Pacific Theatre, and they think of the war in the North Atlantic.  This book really expands on the geographical influence of the fighting in the south pacific, especially the islands of New Guinea & the Solomans.    Bergerud presents a compelling argument that the battles fought by soldiers, the tactics used by generals, and the way men lead their troops in battle is greatly affected, if not primarily driven by, the environment.  Bergerud explains that the soldiers fighting in the South Pacific encountered a whole different war than those soldiers fighting in Europe, and not just because the enemy was Japanese rather than German or Italian. Bergerud maintains that the jungle was more of an enemy at times than the human opponent ever could have been.  He also develops the theory that the jungle was one of the strongest allies that a fighting man could have, since it would shield him from the enemy or provide him with the necessary cover to launch a surprise attack, as the Japanese often did when fighting in the South Pacific.    Bergerud focuses primarily on the terrain and how it shaped the war in this book, although he does intermix (quite nicely, in fact), stories from the soldiers about their experiences and some, although limited, tactical information about the battles.    I would highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to understand why climate and geography play such a huge role in warfare.  I would also highly recommend this book to anyone whois looking to understand the tremendous differences in the land war in the South Pacific versus the land war in Europe or the Middle East.  Overall, it is a very good book, and one well worthy of reading by any student of military history or just someone curious about the Pacific theatre in World War II.	2005-04-13

All students of American political history, and most adults know that Ronald Reagan was the 40th President of the United States, serving from 1981 - 1989.  What many people do not know is that his first real effort to be elected President started in 1976 - it is that campaign that Craig Shirley has recounted for us in fascinating detail in his new book Reagan's Revolution. <br /> <br />Ronald Wilson Reagan (1911-2004) got his start in major politics by being elected governor of California.  He later put together an 11th hour effort for the Republican Presidential Nomination against Richard Nixon, but he really didn't strive for the Presidency until 1976. <br /> <br />This book is a tale of the campaign, start to finish - it is almost an hour-by-hour blow of Reagan's efforts to unseat the incumbent President, Gerald R. Ford.  From the time that Reagan joined the race until the convention in Kansas City was over, it was obvious that this was not going to be a \\"regular\\" political contest, as defined in the 20th century use of the phrase.  Instead, Reagan brought a new zeal and style to the campaign, which made Ford and his team very nervous about their chances of claiming the nomination, much less being elected in their own right to the Presidency in 1976. <br /> <br />I tremendously enjoyed Shirley's writing style; this was an easy book to read, and watching the personable Reagan campaign, including his acceptance of the defeats, was fascinating to me.  I personally do not remember the 1976 Presidential campaign, so this book is especailly valuable in that regard to me. <br /> <br />Craig Shirley has taken his first hand knowledge of Ronald Reagan and other members of the GOP to develop this book.  Although he says that the '76 campaign really changed the world - it is only obvious within the context of this book that it revived the Republican Party and prevented it from going the way of the Whigs or the Know-Nothings of days gone by. <br /> <br />For anyone interested in the history of the modern Republican party, Ronald Reagan, or someone simply looking for a fascinating read about a modern campaign, this is a great book to consider and a very valuable addition to the literature available on recent American elections.	2005-03-27

This subtitle is a little misleading, in my opinion, as the book really focuses on late war (1945) bombing runs over Japan.    One of the two authors of the book (Jim Smith) was on a B-29B bomber at the conclusion of the war, including what he calls \\"The Last Mission\\", which was a bombing run to attack a strategic oil refinery at Akita, with the routing taking the bombers directly over Tokyo.    It is the routing of the bombers that leads Smith and McConnell to write that this mission was the final battle of the war, and perhaps their mission succeeded in ending the war by preventing the attempted coup d'etat from achieving its mission in Tokyo during that final night of August 14-15, 1945.  With a full blackout in effect in Tokyo (because of the stream of American bombers passing overhead), the rebels were unable to accomplish their goals of destroying the Emporer's surrender message and convincing the armed forces of Japan to carry on the fight through the final Ketsu-go, or invasion of the Japanese home islands, where the military intended to cause heavy casualties on the Allied forces.    There is no doubt that that had the coup succeeded, the war would have continued and Allied casulaties would have been enormous during Operation Olympic (the invastion of the Japanese islands), but I do not believe that this bombing mission single-handedly prevented those casualties).  I agree that the timing & routing of the bombers did indeed hamper the rebels' efforts, but I think that the war would still have ended at the same time regardless of whether this mission was conducted or not.    I enjoyed the book quite a bit; the personal history interwoven with the known history of the war makes for very interesting reading.  The only reason I gave the book just 3 stars is because I disagree with the author's conclusions.  I recommend the book for anyone that is seeking to understand the American bombing missions over Japan at the end of the war, but I recommend that each reader carefully draw his or her own conclusions from the text rather than simply accepting that this mission of August 14-15 made as much difference as is suggested in the manuscript.	2005-03-20

Walter Borneman attempts to answer this question by saying that the war \\"forged a nation\\".  While reading the book, I did not (at first) get this impression, but his summary did indeed tie it all together nicely and helped me to understand why he makes this claim. <br /> <br />Borneman's book gives us a good look at the war, including comprehensive sketches of some of the major engagements.  There is no doubt that had the Americans failed to perform as admirably as they did on the ocean, the war would have been easily won by the British very early.  Had the Americans performed better during the land battles, they could have easily knocked the British out of North America and won a handy victory in short order. <br /> <br />In the end, the war turned out to be 3 years of brutal fighting on the North American continent; everywhere from Canada to New Orleans that did not appear to accomplish anything militarily, but it did indeed lead to the different sections of America (New England, the South, the West, etc.) to join together and become the United States of America. <br /> <br />For anyone looking for a solid treatment of the war, I would highly recommend this book.  I was quite pleased to read the book and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the military tactics of the war, the political reasonings behind the war, and the ultimate outcome.	2005-03-08

Texas was once part of the Mexican empire (once Mexico achieved it's independence from Spain), but this story details how Texas became it's own nation and, eventually, part of the United States.    H.W. Brands has given us a tale worthy of remembering, and one that  provides the reader with an exicting picture of this place called Texas.  Brands starts with the American \\"colonization\\" of Texas, including the major player of Moses Austin (father of Stephen F. Austin).    The revolution, in which the Texans, much like Americans of only a few generations before, try to break free from the country that politically rules them, covers the majority of the book.   Brands descirbes, in vivid terms, the people that were critical in achieving Texan independence, such as Bowie, Houston, Travis, and Fannin.  Brands devotes a significant amount of the book to Sam Houston (the first President of Texas), and not nearly enough (in my opinion) to the war of independence, especially the seminal battle at San Jacinto.    I found the book to be very interesting, and well worth reading.  The story drew many parallels between the actions of the early Americans fighting for their independence against the British and  the Texans fighting against the Mexicans.  This time, however, rather than the French and Spanish being the saviors of the rebellious, it was the Americans who came to their aid and helped them to achieve their goal.	2005-02-26

For 2 weeks, these marines held out against superior odds, and that is the crux of this book. <br /> <br />Sloan does a fabulous job of describing the history of the battle - it's more than a recant of the military posturing or the general's orders; it is a true narrative history of the soldiers that participated intertwined with the civilians that were unlucky enough to be on Wake when the attacks started and the actions of the commanding officers. <br /> <br />Publishers Weekly called this \\"The best account yet of the battle for Wake Island\\", and I would agree wholeheartedly with that sentiment.  This is indeed an awesome book, and every student of World War II history should read this to better understand why Wake is so important in our history.  It may have ended in the surrender of American troops on the island, but it was important from a psychological perspective - it proved to the Japanese and the world that America would not die quietly; we would indeed persevere even in the face of tough odds.	2005-02-24

For so many young men, submarines are the things of fancy - objects of awe that create dreams.  Many people are members of the Submarine corps, but for those of us that are not, we have to rely on people like Douglas Waller to help us understand all that goes on during a \\"regular\\" patrol. <br /> <br />Waller was granted uncommon access to spend a patrol on board the USS Nebraska (SSBN-739), and gives us a wonderful account of those three months. <br /> <br />Starting with the challenging departure from home port (this particular submarine is not based at a shore port like some ships; instead, it is based slightly inland, which requires travel down a lengthy channel before reaching the ocean), Waller engrosses the reader from page one. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the entire book - I felt as though Waller was giving me the opportunity to spend three months on patrol (although I did it in a few days, reading through the 400+ pages that he has written for us).  I never once found myself wanting less - I do not think that he included any non-relevant information or extraneous details. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I have a better understanding of how tough the life of a submariner can be, and why these men demand our ultimate respect.  Three months sitting underwater with virtually no human contact except for your shipmates must play havoc with a sailors' psyche, but they all perform admirably. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the United States Naval Submarine Corps.	2005-02-20

There is no question in my mind that he has attempted to provide us with a well researched book that addresses this very topic. <br /> <br />Tushnet only looks at the Supreme Court under the guidance of William Rehnquist, the current Chief Justice (although, as is pointed out in the book in no uncertain terms, he will not be Chief for much longer because of his medical ailments).   <br /> <br />There is no doubt that Rehnquist is a brilliant justice and a highly qualified leader; he does not permit long winded discussions of cases that lead off onto unrelated tangents, and he runs a pretty tight ship. <br /> <br />The book looks at each of the nine justices currently sitting on the court (Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Breyer, & Ginsburg), although the author pays more attention to certain justices than others.  For example, Clarence Thomas gets an entire chapter devoted to his judicial philosophy and his conservatism.  Scalia and Kennedy likewise get chapters devoted mostly to their judicial philosophies.  Other justices, such as Souter and Breyer, get very little attention in this book. <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading the book - it gave me much more respect than I had for at least one of the justices, although it lessened my respect for another of the justices.  Tushnet does give us a relatively unbiased picture of the justices, and does a spectactular job of explaining what makes the justices \\"tick\\" (when he devotes enough pages to that individual member of the court). <br /> <br />There are two things that I would change about this book, although neither of them should deter anyone with interest in this subject matter from reading this book.  The first is that the entire book (with the notable exception of the final chapter, which addresses what is likely to happen in the future) is written in the past tense.  It is almost like we're reading about justices from the middle of the 19th century that have all been buried for 100+ years.  I feel as though the justices should be given more present tense treatment.  The second thing I would change is the unequal amount of discussion time each justice receives.  Let's hear more about Breyer, more about O'Connor, more about Souter.  Those three make up 1/3 of the court, they should make up 1/3 of the book - especially since O'Connor is so frequently a swing vote on the court. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book tremendously, and would highly recommend it to anyone.	2005-02-18

Last year, I read a book about Henry Ford and his anti-Semitism.  At that time, I had a very narrow view about the man - I wish now that I had read this book, Douglas Brinkley's study of Ford and his company, before I had read that one. <br /> <br />Brinkley's mammoth volume on this one man and the company he created is a tremendous addition to American business history.  Brinkely gives us a comprehensive study (about half of the book) of Henry Ford the man and how he created the Ford Motor Company.  This segment of the book really gave me a new respect for the man as an innovator and an idealist, though his engineering skills were apparently lacking (at one point Brinkley tells his audience that Ford couldn't even read a blueprint).  Brinkley intertwines the story of Henry's son Edsel, who was given the unenviable task of running Ford Motor while Henry was still alive and wouldn't release control over some of the day-to-day operations. <br /> <br />After seeing Edsel die an untimely death, we see Ford Motor transition to Henry II.  This is the first time that Henry Sr. relinquishes some control, and we see what the company can do (and does) during this period.  Brinkley vividly tells the story of Henry II and his interactions with the labor movement in conjunction with operations at Ford Motor. <br /> <br />Towards the end of the book, we see the post Henry II era.  We see a couple of different CEO's, including Donald Peterson, who seemed to help the company, and Jac Nasser, who probably isn't missed much by the Ford family - his reign saw the depletion of massive cash reserves from the corporation.  At the conclusion of the book, Brinkley shows us the path that the company is taking today under the leadership of Bill Ford, Jr. <br /> <br />I believe that Brinkley has given us a wonderful book here - telling us the story not just of a man or a company, but a combination of so many facets of American history.  What made Henry Ford tick?  Why did he create Ford MotorCompany?  What did he do to make it survive?  How did Ford Motor Company impact Michigan and America as a whole?  All of these questions, and so many more, are answered in this splendid book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a strong understanding of how one man and the business he built can have such a tremendous impact on America and the rest of the world.	2004-12-12

Everyone \\"knows\\" that the United States Army Corps of Engineers built the canal - or did they? <br /> <br />McCullough dispels this rumor quite handily - yes, Army men were involved, but they were not acting as members of the army at the time the canal was built; they were acting as civilians. <br /> <br />The Path Between the Seas starts with the French involvement (as the title suggests, the book starts 44 years before the canal opened for public use) in the building.  For many years, the French toiled and struggled to build a sea-level canal in Panama while the USA simply considered Nicaragua to be a better alternative.  McCullough describes the French achievements in great detail, and shows why the French failures were so monumental.  After the French decided to abandon the project, the United States purchased the assets of the French company and started the American effort to construct the canal.  In my opinion, this is the most exciting part of the book - the transition to the Americans, and the work that was accomplished in such a short period of time. <br /> <br />In this abridged version, I believe that too much attention is focused on the French effort (about 70% of the disc time was devoted to the French work and failures).  If the presentation was more balanced, this abridgement would be very exciting indeed.  This is not the fault of McCullough - undoubtedly the full version of the book is outstanding, as are all of his works, but the abridgment just didn't quite do it for me.	2004-11-25

Paul Dickson argues in his book \\"Sputnik: The shock of the Century\\" that this little 184 pound satellite launched by the Soviets in October 1957 changed the world.  He says that it changed the way Americans thought, and that it paved the way for our own space program. <br /> <br />I agree that it was a shocking event and quite a blow to the pride of the United States - to see the Soviets launch an artificial Earth orbiting satellite before we could do it?  Unheard of!  I don't think that it changed the world quite as much as Dickson claims, however. <br /> <br />At the close of his book, Dickson says that the two most important marvels of the 20th century were Sputnik and the Internet.  Certainly leaves a lot of room for discussion, doesn't it? <br /> <br />I believe that Dickson has done us quite a service by writing this book - it is a great history both of the space race up to, and including, an introduction to both the Apollo and Gemini missions of the 1960's, as well as the social history that acompanied this massive PR coup by the Soviets.   <br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the way that Dickson explained how much America focused on education (science, math, and the like) after the Soviets beat us into space.  I also tremendously enjoyed the role of Werner Von Braun in our own efforts to launch a satellite.  However, I think that this book easily could have been much, much larger in order to adequately cover the primary topic - Sputnik and all of the ramifications of that fateful day in October.	2004-09-14

After reading the book, I believe that it lives up to the billing of a revolutionary leader, but the forging of the American Presidency is a little lacking. <br /> <br />While reading this book it is easy to get caught up in the patriotic fervor that was felt by many Americans that fought in Washington's army during the war years.  There is no question that Washington was a great military commander and a fantastic leader of men. <br /> <br />The book is most memorable when describing the winters at Valley Forge and at Morristown 2 years later.  Chadwick does a wonderful job of giving the reader fantastic details about the horrors of wintertime in these regions and the woes that the soldiers were forced to contend with while struggling for food, clothing, and shelter. <br /> <br />The book also reveals a less awe-inspiring picture of Washington - a man who could curse like a sailor and one who had very few qualms about executing a person that had committed a serious crime.  Although this latter characteristic is tempered by the fact that he would frequently sentence multiple men to death for a crime and then pardon all but the most egregious offenders, it is still one that is not so noble for a man considered to be a great American hero. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book tremendously, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid picture of Washington as a wartime commander.  If, however, the reader is searching for a book that comprehensively paints the picture of how Washington formed the office of the Presidency, this is not the one - it just doesn't give enough details except to say that much of Washington's Presidency was based on lessons learned as a military commander.	2004-09-06

Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  The very name conjures up images of a Great President, a great governor, and a great man who overcame physical challenges to become that great leader. <br /> <br />In his final book, Steve Neal has given us the story of the 1932 Democratic National Convention, where FDR was nominated for President for the first time. <br /> <br />Neal does a fantastic job of giving us biographical sketches, including political philosophies, of the contenders for the nomination, and then dives right into the excitement of the convention itself.   <br /> <br />FDR may have been the leader in delegate count at the start of the convention, but that did not mean he had the nomination all wrapped up.  Unlike today's conventions, Democratic conventions prior to 1936 required a 2/3 majority to nominate the candidate.  FDR did not have a 2/3 majority when the convention opened, thus necessitating his political operatives to wheel & deal in order to secure the nomination. <br /> <br />It is this political wheeling & dealing that makes the book so wonderful & readable.  The back room efforts with Ritchie and Baker, and the deal made with John Nance Garner that secured the nomination for FDR are given ample attention in this book. <br /> <br />I found that I had a terribly hard time putting the book down once I started reading it.  It is well written, and an absolute must read for any FDR afficinado.	2004-08-07

Manifest Destiny - 5 Americans	What do the above have in common? The answer is provided quite nicely in Warren Zimmerman's book &quot;First Great Triumph&quot;. In it, he explains what 5 great Americans - John Hay, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Theodore Roosevelt, Hencry Cabot Lodge, and Elihu Root had to do with the forming of the American century (the 20th Century). <br />  <br /> Each of these men played his own role in creating Imperialistic America, starting in the late 19th century, and their contributions to American foreign policy continue through to this day. <br />  <br /> This is an important book for anyone that wants to understand the personalities of these five men and the actions that each took to make America the dominant player in world affairs that it has been during the last 100+ years. <br />  <br /> The book is divided into two sections; biographical sketches of each of these five men, and then a section on how America became an Imperalistic power, similar to Great Britain or any of a number of the European countries in earlier centuries. Starting with the Spanish American war, the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands, and pushing through to American intervention in World War I, this book does a fantastic job of explaining the events that occured and the personalities involved. <br />  <br /> I now understand why Zimmerman chose these five men to study in this book - when I first started to read it, I thought that perhaps others, such as William McKinley or William H. Seward should have been included in the biography section, but Seward's contributions were too early to be included in this study, and McKinley was too reserved to be included in a group of men that firmly believed in American expansion, much as earlier Americans had proclaimed &quot;Mainfest Destiny&quot;. <br />  <br /> I enjoyed the book greatly, and would highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a study of early American foreign policy, or an understanding of why America played such a big role in world eventsduring the 20th century.	2004-07-25

That is the title given to this book, but the title certainly is not reflective of the substance of the work.<br />The book does center around the political contest known as the Presidential Election of 1912, but it veers off on many tangents that are unrelated to the contest.  It is true that there were four major candidates for President that year, and all of them had a story to tell, but this book does not cover that story as well as it should.<br />The book spends entirely too much time discussing the history of the candidates for President - in fact almost 1/2 of the book is devoted to biographical sketches of these four men.<br />The most exciting (and relevant) section of the book details the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore in 1912 -Chace does a great job of relaying the exuberance felt by the attendees of the convention, and gets the reader very excited about this important moment in American Political History when Woodrow Wilson, soon to be elected the 28th President of the United States, was selected as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party.  To a much lesser scale, and not quite as well, Chace describes the Republican, Progressive, and Socialist conventions which led to the nomination of William H. Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, and Eugene V. Debs respectively.<br />The election gets almost no attention at all in this book, but the Wilson administration does get a significant amount of attention, as does the legacy of Wilson and the impact of both Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt on a future President's administration - that of Franklin D. Roosevelt.<br />All told, I cannot recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a comprehensive story of the 1912 Presidential Election.  However, if one is looking for brief (very brief) biographical sketches of the candidates, this is a great book, with some very exciting highlights of an important politicalcampaign thrown in.	2004-06-17

Chaikin has given us the story of the Apollo space program - the only program launched by NASA that has landed humans on another world.<br />Chaikin launches the book with the story of the tragic fire that claimed the lives of three astronauts - the first three austronauts to die either in preparation for or during a mission for NASA.  The loss of Grissom, White, and Chaffee would pave the way to significant improvements in the Apollo program and probably helped to save the crew of Apollo 13 a few years later.<br />The book races through the thrills of the Apollo 11 mission and the first humans to set foot on another world - Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, as they landed on the moon.  Chaikin captures the tribulations of the Apollo 13 mission where Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise were nearly the first space casualties and the heroic efforts of the NASA staff to return them safely to Earth.  He continues through the remaining Apollo missions, concluding with Apollo 17, the final moon landing.<br />Chaikin has taken terrific interviews and conversations with the astronauts and other members of the Apollo program into account when writin this book.  The book covers every topic from the exhiliration of launch to the post-recovery doldrums experienced by some of the astronauts.  He explains how space flight changed some of the men, and merely enhanced traits seen in others.<br />This book is a tremendous piece of literature that belong in every space afficinado's library, and any historian of space travel must read this to understand how the Apollo missions paved the way for the Space Shuttle program and any upcoming manned missions that humans may have planned for the Moon, Mars, or beyond.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with any interest in the history of space travel.  It is easy to read, and very enjoyable.	2004-05-31

Although they were severely outnumbered, and fighting in one of the world's harshest environments, they somehow managed to emerge from this horrible scenario and maintain the honor and dignity that the Marine Corps has demonstrated from day one.<br />Russ gives us a narrative history collected from many interviews conducted with survivors of the campaign and weaves it into the military and tactical struggle faced by these men.  Some of the pictures that he paints are gut-wrenching because of the horrors that these men endured; some cause the reader to smile because of the way that the soldiers faced their lot and overcame such challenging obstacles.  His writing style is crisp & clear, which enables the reader to sympathize with the harshness of the reality that the soldiers faced in North Korea.<br />Without a book like this, the literature on the battles of the Korean War could never be complete.  Russ has ensured that the men who faced the Chinese in the winter of 1950 will never be forgotten.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the humanistic side of the Korean war; it does not delve into the military campaign as much as the people, but it does do justice to the military commanders involved in this series of engagements.	2004-04-17

Board of Education: Caste, Culture, and the Constitution (Landmark Law Cases and American Society)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Good book, but does not focus on Brown v. Board of Education	When one sees the title &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, it immediately stirs up notions of a Supreme Court case involving desegregation of public schools in America.  Robert Cottol, Raymond Diamond, and Leland Ware have given us some of that feel, but not enough in this book.<br />The book, only 240+ pages to start with, does not even touch on the Brown case (or any of the six cases that collectively were referred to as &quot;Brown&quot;) until page 119.  The first half of the book is spent exploring the history of segregation in education and in America as a whole.  I believe that this is an important topic, but not of enough importance to require half of a book that is supposed to be about this one Supreme Court case.<br />Aside from the fact that there is little in the book that deals with the case itself (besides the history of segregation in education, there is a substantial section of the book that deals with direct ramifications of ordered desegregation and the reactions of state and local governments to this order), the book is well written.  I enjoyed reading the book, but I think that I would refer readers to a broader history of the Supreme Court and interventions in race relations, such as the new Klarman book &quot;From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality&quot; instead of this book.<br />If, however, one is looking for a consice book that does indeed provide the story of segregation in American education, including the historic decision in 1954 that abolished that segregation, this is a great book to read and understand.	2004-03-07

Perry has given us a glimpse into the wartime efforts and heroics of five men who later occupied the Oval Office of the White House.<br />Presidents Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Harrison, and McKinley were all soldiers in the Civil War, and all had exposure to enemy fire at some point during the war (Hayes was wounded four separate times during the course of the war, though none of his injuries was life-threatening).<br />In my opinion, Perry has given us a good reading of Civil War history, including an introduction to some battles that are not often heard of (such as Garfield's involvement at The Big Sandy Valley battle in Kentucky).  However, Perry gives short shrift to U.S. Grant, who was the only professional military officer to become President, and to McKinley, who was but an 18 year old Private when he enlisted at the outbreak of the war.<br />Perry's writing is lively, and gives the reader a nice vision of what was going on not only on the battlefield, but also in the minds of these five men.  He closes the book by giving us a brief glance into the political careers (however short, bland or corrupt their administrations may have been) of these men as well.<br />I enjoyed reading the recounts of the battles and the actions taken by these men immensely, and I would highly recommend the book to anyone that is looking for a good understanding of the military years of Garfield, Hayes, or Harrison.  With the shortcomings given to Grant and McKinley, I think that a more exhaustive biography would better provide an adequate picture of their wartime activities.	2004-02-27

Bush's administration in the early 2000's.  However, he tells tales that cast suspicion on the motives of this administration, starting with the plan to oust Saddam Hussein (as early as February 2001) to the Bush/Cheney economic policy of multiple tax cuts that, as O'Neill & fed chairman Alan Greenspan say, could be detrimental to the long-term health of the American economy.<br />The book is well-written, and moves along at a quick pace.  I do not believe that the book was written with the intent of discrediting the present administration, but instead was written to show one individual's view of what happens in the political circles around George Bush.<br />If you are a member of George Bush's fan club, this book will probably enrage you, since it is at times very critical of the administration.  If you are, however, an opponent to the current political leadership in this country, you just may find yourself shaking your head and saying \\"Wow!  I knew that, but it still seems so hard to believe!\\"....<br />I would encourage anyone that reads this book to read it with a critical eye and to know that the book is likely to arouse passion or fury previously not felt about \\"W\\".	2004-01-31

Jon Meacham has tried to go where others have really not gone before - to explore the friendship between President Franklin Roosevelt and his counterpart, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in his new book Franklin and Winston.<br />Meacham has done a great job of describing, in intimate detail, the relationship between these two men.  I consider the book to be a true hybrid between a biography and a history because of the style of writing - intermixing details about the individual (the biography part) with situations in which the person played a role (the historical part).  Meacham intertwines these two in remarkable fashion.<br />This is an important book that truly displays how Roosevelt and Churchill were not only political compadres, but were indeed friends.  I greatly enjoyed how Meacham discussed, with such attention to details, those situations in which both men were involved and played a critical role.  I also appreciated the way in which Meacham explained how those encounters bolstered the friendship between the men - and why.<br />Although the friendship was rocky at times, with Roosevelt bowing to political necessity in lieu of being true friends, there is no doubt in my mind, based on Meacham's book, that these two men were so much more than just political heavyweights - they were indeed friends.	2003-11-12

In his book Fraud of the Century, Roy Morris Jr. has given us a snapshot of an election in America's centennial year that would be considered the most controversial election in America's history - maybe until the 2000 election, but maybe even beyond that one.<br />Morris does a very good job of reporting the details of the 1876 campaign, starting with the party's selection of the candidates, brief biographies of each of the major candidates for President, and, finally, the campaign itself, the election, and the post-election shennanigans.<br />Those who are not aware of the extent of the corruption and fraudulent undertakings in a few states (Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon) during the course of the election will be rewarded when reading this book - Morris examines each of these cases in great detail and explains what bearing the states each had on the election.<br />Although this book does not flow as well as some other political history books that I have read, it is a well written and easily understandable story of an election that, although was not stolen by Hayes was stolen for Hayes by members of the Republican party.  This book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in American political history.	2003-10-22

In this age where the United States is fighting terrorists in the middle east, Wheelan has given us a historical background of the American struggles against the Barbary states.<br />The Barbary States (Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers) were engaged in what Wheelan describes as terrorism - capturing American ships and enslaving their passengers simply because they were Christians and not Moslems.  The wars appear to be an extension of the age-old religious wars that have been ongoing for thousands of years.  However, President Jefferson decided that he would end the battle between America and the Barbary States by fighting a military conflict with the aggressors.<br />Wheelan does a fantastic job of describing the individual military endeavors during the war, and he provides us with top-notch descriptions of the acts undertaken by the enslaving Barbarians against the Christian prisoners.<br />I enjoyed the book tremendously, and would recommend it to all as reading on a subject that is not well known in our nation's history.  However, the last few chapters of the book really start to slide outside of the expectations based on the title - Wheelan dives into the War of 1812 against the British and the ongoing fight against the Barbary states into the Madison administration.  These small detractors notwithstanding, the book is an excellent addition to the literature on America's early naval history.	2003-10-13

In his book Murdering McKinley: The making of Theodore Roosevelt's America, author Eric Rauchway has given us a picture of a somewhat troubled young man that assassinated the beloved President McKinley in 1901.  McKinley's assassination marked the third time in just forty years that an American President had been killed.  There is no question that Lincoln's assassination changed the direction of the nation, and there is no question that Garfield's assassination had virtually no impact, since he had only been in office for a few months when he was killed.<br />McKinley, however, had just been elected to his second term, and was considered to be a good President (consistently ranked in the top 20 Presidents ever to lead the nation), and the oft-feared Theodore Roosevelt was his newly elected Vice President, placed there by the Republicans to stymie his exuberance and minimize his impact on the party.<br />Rauchway excells at his descriptions of the murder and the ascension of Roosevelt to the nation's highest office, including the reasons so many people were nervous about TR taking over the Presidency.  Thus, the first half of the book flows very nicely and is an easy read.  However, after the assassin Czolgosz was executed, the book drifts into social history and spends a significant amount of time discussing whether or not Czolgosz committed the crime because he was infected by society and thus went mad.  Rachway also delves into the theory that Czolgosz was insane stemming from a bout of syphilis.<br />I enjoyed the book a tremendous amount, but I truly believe that the subtitle of the book is slightly misleading - the author pays much attention to the factors that affected Czolgosz, and less emphasis is given to the way that Theodore Roosevelt changed the country once he became President.  I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to understand this heinous crime and the immediate implications.	2003-09-28

A book from a contemporary source that has such &quot;insider&quot; knowledge of how FDR operated as Robert Jackson is a marvelous addition to the existing literature.<br />Jackson does not make any promises at the outset of the book except to be objective, and he certainly does meet this goal.  Jackson describes FDR as President, Commander-in-Chief, and a human being, outlining his strengths as well as his weaknesses.  Jackson makes no excuses for the President when his policies and knowledge did not seem to be best for the country (Jackson even criticizes FDR for his lack of economic knowledge and business sense).<br />I enjoyed Jackson's writing style (he is considered by many to be one of the best authors to ever sit on the Supreme Court of the United States), and I found that the book was easy to read.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in President Franklin Roosevelt - the stories and anecdotes given in the text make it highly readable, and the examples Jackson provides to detail his points are always logical and related to the subject at hand.	2003-09-10

In his new book, The American Axis, Max Wallace has painted a portrait of two Americans that people seem to love, but had a very sinister past.<br />Henry Ford, the American manufacturing genius, and Charles Lindbergh, the aviation hero, are the subjects of this book.  Both Ford and Lindbergh are revered by much of the American populous, but Wallace has shown us the facts about the darker sides of their respective personalities.<br />Henry Ford has always been thought to be a red-blooded American, a capitalist with a love for the United States.  In the book, however, his anti-Semitic side is exposed and the ensuing discussion reveals that Ford was anything but all-American.  He was, as the title of the book suggests, a person that helped the Third Reich's rise to power in Wartime Europe.  By promoting anti-Semitism and manufacturing goods for the Nazi war machine, Ford has demonstrated that his true loyalty laid only to himself.<br />Charles Lindbergh is generally only recognized as the \\"hero\\" that flew the first non-stop transatlantic flight.  In reality, however, this book depicts him as a naive person that was easily swayed and duped into believing that the Nazi cause was an appropriate movement to follow.  His beliefs appear to have been easily manipulated by others around him, thus being duped into passing incorrect information to the Allied government about the strength of the Nazi military before war was declared.<br />Overall, Wallace has done a very good job of revisiting these two American figures and demonstrating that their reputations are in need of a thorough review.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in behind the scenes activites of World War II.  Any Ford or Lindbergh fan should also read the book, but be conscious of the fact that widely held conceptions of these two men may be dashed by the facts presented and conclusions drawn.	2003-09-01

Although many people know that James Abram Garfield was President of the United States of America, few people know that he was the second President assassinated while in office.  Fewer yet know the reality of how he became President, what he accomplished (or failed to accomplish), and why someone saw fit for him to die.<br /> Kenneth Ackerman does a remarkable job of tackling these tough topics in his new book Dark Horse: The Surprise Election and Political Murder of President James A. Garfield.  The Republican National Convention of 1880, where Garfield was selected as the party's nominee for President (over the likes of U.S. Grant, John Sherman, and James G. Blaine), is the starting point for the book.  Ackerman explains how and why Garfield got the nomination over these better known politicians of the era.  Once nominated, of course, Garfield was in the throes of the campaign to be elected President.  Here again, Ackerman details Garfield's &quot;front porch&quot; campaign, and the political maneuvering that went on behind the scenes to make his election a reality over the Democratic candidate, Winfield Scott Hancock.<br /> Once elected President, Garfield was immediately confronted with job-seekers looking for a &quot;plum&quot; job in the administration.  Many of the &quot;applicants&quot; had assisted in the campaign in one way or another, though some (like Charles Guiteau) significantly over-valued their efforts.  While reading the book, it initially seems that perhaps the patronage issue is overdone, but it becomes clear why when Ackerman explains the significance of Charles Guiteau.<br /> Guiteau is the man that actually shot Garfield in a train station in Washington in 1881.  Ackerman makes an extremely compelling case for Guiteau's rationalization as to why he must &quot;remove&quot; the President from office, based in no small part upon Garfield's failure to provide Guiteau with the foreign minister position that he so desired.  The death of President Garfield is also addressed in the book, as is the elevation of Chester A. Arthur into the Presidency, although these topics are given minimal attention, as is appropriate given the title of the book.<br /> Overall, I would heartily recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the American Presidency, the Garfield administration, or Gilded Age Politics.  This book is an exemplary addition to the available literature on the Garfield administration, as well as Gilded Age politics in general.	2003-08-18

AWESOME political history	Dark Horse: The surprise election and Political Murder of President James A. Garfield, by Kenneth D. Ackerman, is an extremely well written book about an era frequently bypassed by today's historians.<br />The Gilded Age has been largely ignored it seems by historians, but this book is a tremendous addition to the literature available on the political history of the era.<br />Ackerman has provided us with a book that truly chronicles Garfield's rise from semi-obscurity to the Presidency and then his assassination by a deranged man that claimed he was \\"removing\\" the President for the good of the Republican party and the country.<br />Starting with the Republican national convention of 1880, where Garfield was truly the \\"dark horse\\" candidate (U.S. Grant, James Blaine, and John Sherman were the leading contenders for the nomination), Ackerman has given us a fantastic political history of what transpired at the convention to earn Garfield the nomination.  <br />He then proceeds to the national campaign against the Democratic nominee (General Winfield Hancock) and Garfield's \\"front porch\\" campaign.  His description of the national race that ended in Garfield winning the Presidency is unmatched in writing today.<br />Ackerman intermixes Charles Guiteau into the history in appropriate places, and finally brings Guiteau to the forefront when he shoots Garfield in the railway station as Garfield was preparing for vacation.  The subsequent trial and execution of Guiteau are also covered in the book.<br />I must commend Ackerman for ending with the elevation of Chester Arthur to the Presidency - other books might go into detail on how Arthur's Presidency was similar to and different than Garfield's, but Ackerman holds true to his title and stops with the ascendancy of Chester Arthur.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in 19th century American politics, the Garfield administration (as short as it may have been), or to better understand the reasons Guiteau assassinated the President.  It's an easy read, very well researched, and an oustanding addition to the available books on the subject.	2003-08-11

Paul Hoffman has given us a biography of a man who seems to be relatively unknown here in the United States, although he is very well known in his native Brazil - Alberto Santos-Dumont.<br />I purchased this book because I had been exposed to Santos-Dumont while listening to James Tobin's To Conquer the Air book, and I wanted to understand more about this uncommon man.<br />Santos-Dumont was an innovator, and experimented primarily with lighter-than-air flying craft (such as attaching a motor to a hydrogen filled balloon).  He eventually moved into heavier than air flying craft by inventing airplanes in the same genre as the Wright Brothers.<br />I found the book to be fast-paced and well-written.  However, I had two minor concerns with the book - first, there was precious little introduction to some people that were important in the development of powered flight (i.e. Octave Chanute or Otto Lilienthal), despite the fact that they were mentioned numerous times during the book.  The second concern I had was that one chapter seemed to have nothing more than a tangential connection to Santos-Dumont - a chapter devoted primarily to the use of aircraft in World War I.<br />Despite these two minor shortcomings, I highly recommend the book to all, since it truly allows us to explore a man that many of us know virtually nothing about, and his important work leading to powered flight.	2003-07-25

Brands has outdone himself with this book.  The age of Gold is more than just a story about gold - it is a story about early California.<br />It is easy to say that the history of California starts with the Gold Rush of the 1840's.  It would also be easy to say that it starts hundreds of years before that, but Brands focuses on how the gold rush in California really impacted the whole nation.<br />Brands has written this book in the narrative style, which helps the reader to understand the personal motivations and feelings of each person involved in the book.  It is a thrill to read how John Sutter feels when Gold is discovered on his property, and it is equally heartbreaking to read about the failure of some who traveled from foreign lands to make their fortunes.<br />I believe that the most important pieces presented in the book are how the Gold Rush impacted the United States as a whole, including the theory that it helped build up sentiment that led to the onset of the Civil War.  The political struggles faced by some of the players in 1840's and 1850's California, such as John Fremont (and his wife Jessee) are explained in great detail and add much imagery and understanding to the importance that the discovery of this precious yellow metal in the bear republic really meant.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for an understanding of how Gold was discovered in California, but it should appeal to a much wider audience than such a select group of individuals.  It should also appeal to anyone with an interest in 19th century America, or the early West, including the building of the transcontinental railroad, which had roots in California and the east.<br />I am looking forward to Brands' next book with great anticipation.	2003-07-18

This, however, is not the case.  The book focuses on two separate topics - the world's fair of 1893 in Chicago, including the planning and execution of the exposition itself, and a serial killer that lived in Chicago at the same time frame that the aforementioned events were occuring.  <br />The only true relationship between the two stories is that they both took place in Chicago in the early 1890's.  Other than that, there is no true correlation, although one can see where the author attempted to tie the two together by placing the serial killer at the fair with one or more of his victims.<br />In my opinion, this book should have been split into two different books; one on the history of the fair, and one a true crime book focusing on the killer, the subsequent investigation into his treachery, and punishment of the killer.	2003-07-02

The very thought of this pales by comparison to the gold rushes seen in California in the 19th century, but there was indeed gold found in North Carolina as well.<br />The authors have done a nice job of introducing the reader to the history of gold mining in the state of North Carolina.  The book provides the reader with a quality study of the personas and events that triggered the gold rush in the south, as well as the struggles faced in trying to recover gold in this region.<br />The book starts with a rather dry chapter on the geologic activity in the region, including where the gold was found.  From there, however, the book picks up pace nicely and becomes a great narrative story of mining and recovery of gold nuggets and flakes in this American state.<br />In my opinion, the strongest features of the book are the introductions to the characters (quite literally, some of these folks were indeed characters) that were involved in the mining experiences in North Carolina starting as early as 1799.  The authors have also done a splendid job in describing the meteoric rise and similarly rapid fall of the mines themselves, including the many times that mining properties were sold at auction or purchased by new gold-hungry entrepeneurs.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an introduction to gold mining in North Carolina, but be warned that the first chapter can be tough sledding.  I can only hope that there are further books written by this team detailing out the lives of the people that made these events so interesting.	2003-06-21

He has given us a look at the Stock Market Crash of 1929 through the eyes of the people that participated, rather than looking at it strictly from an economic or political historical viewpoint.<br />Klein starts his book with a description of American society in the 1920's and explains to us why the society of excess and speculation led to the crash moreso than a failing of the general American economy.  By dotting the landscape with characters, some familiar and some unfamiliar, Klein gives us a good portrayal of the times.<br />There is, unfortunately, only a short section of the book that actually deals with the events of the crash itself.  This section focuses the days between Black Thursday and Bloody Tuesday, which culminated in a horrific period of losses in the market.<br />Klein does a good job of staying on task during the sections of the book in explaining the economic factors and the behind-the-scenes actions that took place during these few hectic days.  He does not, however, explain the immediate social ramifications (such as the fact that people who lost everything gave up on life) as well as might be expected; he gives this facet of the crash only peripheral coverage.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a socio-economic history of America during this 1920's.  It does a very good job of covering this topic.  However, if one is looking for details just on the crash itself and those few terrible days on Wall Street, that reader would be well served to find another book to read.	2003-05-17

There is, of course, nothing wrong with being opiniated, and Gillman does not let this interfere with his reporting of the evident facts.<br />Gillman's analysis of the election and the subsequent judicial participation is a good one, and certainly does correlate well with the title of the book; he explains well why he feels that the justices of the Supreme Court (all five of them that sided with Bush) determined who the next President of the United States would be.<br />As I was reading this book, I frequently found that I had to stop and re-read some sentences multiple times in order to understand the meaning; verbs were conjugated improperly, and improper tenses were used.  I do not fault the author for these grammatical errors - I fault the editor for failing to catch and correct them.<br />I found this to be a valuable book, and one worthy of studying carefully as study of the Presidental election of 2000 and judicial intervention in that contest.  I gave it four stars rather than five because of what I see as a lack of strong editing.	2003-05-06

Jackson has chosen to focus on Naval history during World War II, with an emphasis on two ships that are seemingly unrelated except for their assignment into the same task forces during combat exercises.<br />Jackson interviewed many of the ships' crew members in order to tell their tales, and supplemented that material with official histories of the ships and their combat experiences.<br />I found Jackson's style of writing to be easy to read, and very descriptive of the events encountered by the crew members.  I thoroughly enjoyed his style of bringing the sailors to life in the book, and explaining the grim realities of naval &amp; air combat.<br />The book also gave me new insights into some of the key military players in the war - I have a different perspective now of Admiral Halsey than I did when I started the book, and Captain Gehres is a man that I had never heard of, but I now have seen an interesting perspective of the man and respect for his struggles to save his ship.<br />I feel that although Jackson has provided us with a strong narrative history, he sometimes repeats information that was previously written in the book.  The seemingly haphazard style of bouncing between the events occuring on the two ships sometimes leads to confusion, but this is easily overcome if each chapter/section is read as a separate &quot;tale&quot; to be told about naval warfare in the Pacific.<br />I think that this is a very good book, and will interest anyone that has a desire to learn more about warfare and the men who fought on these two ships.	2003-05-06

The boat touches on such important topics as Operation Drumbeat and the Enigma machine, both of which were critical to the success (or failure) of the U-boat war.<br />The book does not focus primarily on life on a submarine, as might be expected, but instead truly focuses on the war within the war - the German effort to isolate Britain and starve her by sinking ships faster than the Allied forces could build them, and the Allies' desperate efforts to prevent the Germans from achieving this goal.  In line with this effort, Williams brings the participants in this war back to life with his choice of utilizing their words and memoirs.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the naval war in the Atlantic ocean or the reason why the Allies were finally able to defeat the German naval threat and go on to win the Second World War against the Germans.	2003-04-15

Adams	John Quincy Adams was the sixth President of the United States, but much less well known than his father John Adams, the second President of the USA.<br />In this splendid biography, Robert Remini has provided us with a concise volume detailing the life of John Quincy Adams.  Within this book, it is easily seen why JQA is rated as &quot;below average&quot; as a President, but highly regarded as an international diplomat.<br />Remini has done a spectactular job in describing the whole life of John Quincy Adams, and helps us to understand why Adams' life is being reclassified as more successful than previously recognized, despite the fact that his Presidency was a failure.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a basic understanding of Adams the man, not just as the President.	2003-04-05

The book only refers to Franklin Roosevelt a few times during the course of the entire manuscript.<br />Instead, the book focuses primarily on the hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys and, along with many buildings on the Keys, a large number of World War I veterans who were known as the &quot;bonus marchers&quot; who had been relocated to veterans camps in the Keys.<br />The book is relatively short (under 150 pages), and spends a considerable amount of time on the hurricane itself and the surviving veterans' recollections of that terrible storm.<br />In my opinion, the scholarly research is good, but not overly comprehensive; much of the data contained in the book is copies of oral interviews either from the local papers or the veterans' board that investigated the disaster.<br />If the reader is looking for a history of Franklin Roosevelt and his administration's efforts to work with the bonus marchers, I would recommend a different book.  If the reader is looking for a book that tells the tragic story of veterans that suffered through a hurricane, then this is the perfect book for you.	2003-03-26

The very title &quot;Hard Bargain&quot; leads one to believe that the book is going to focus on the negotiations that took place between Roosevelt and Churchill to obtain the desired result.  The subtitle of &quot;How FDR Twisted Churchill's Arm, Evaded the Law, and Changed the Role of the American Presidency&quot; begs for a somewhat different story.<br />In this book, Robert Shogan does a great job of explaining the deal that was struck between Roosevelt &amp; Churchill to trade 50 aging US destroyers for leases on British posessions near the US.  However, Shogan does not (in my opinion) do the subtitle of his book justice (with the exception of the &quot;new&quot; preface) until the very last chapter.<br />This book seems to paint FDR as an egocentric who was more concerned about his Presidency than the defense of Britain, and more concerned about keeping his nose clean in the eye of the public than consummating a deal that could greatly benefit the nation.<br />My recommendation is that anyone interested in the acts that brought about the idea of Lend-Lease read this book with a carefully inquisitive view about the author's treatment of FDR.  Anyone interested in understanding how FDR really changed the Presidency to be the office held by Reagan, Bush, Clinton, or Bush, really should skip this book and find one more focused on politics than the history of a single deal between two nations.	2003-01-04

Although the book seems to spend a tremendous amount of time discussing Henry Morgenthau (Roosevelt's Secretary of the Treasury), this is easily understood as the plot unfolds.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to everyone interested in the political history of the World War II era.  I feel that the only drawback to the book is that there is an entire chapter devoted to post wartime activities in Germany.  In my opinion, this chapter is unnecessary, since neither Roosevelt nor Truman was strongly involved in the daily operations in Germany after the war ended.	2002-12-31

This title led me to believe that the book was going to focus exclusively on the city of New York during the years 1775-1783.<br />Although the book does not focus entirely on events in the city during the war years, it does a very good job of telling the story of the American Revolution while displaying the importance of New York during this critical time in American history.<br />I found the chapter on the relationship between events in the city of New York and the battle at Yorktown to be most impressive and valuable.  This chapter gave me a new appreciation for the American army and their abilities in time of grave crisis.<br />General George Washington, in all his splendor, is well depicted in this book, especially as his actions relate to his desire to recapture the city of New York, which was occupied by the British.  Other American, British, &amp; French military leaders are also described in the book, provided that their actions relate to one or more of the campaigns in New York.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone that has a basic understanding of the Revolutionary War and is looking for a slightly different perspective than that presented in many general histories.  After accepting the fact that the book was not going to focus on New York City, the only disappointment I found in this book is that the battle of Saratoga, which I believe was pivotal in the war, does not get much attention, despite its location and the interaction between Burgoyne and Clinton.	2002-12-28

His book provides the reader with a structure not always seen in history books; the chapters focus on a geographic region within a specific time frame.<br />For those people that have learned that American history started only with the original 13 British colonies (as is so frequently taught in American schools today), this book will dispel that myth by introducing the reader to such areas as Spanish New Mexico and Florida, early Hawaii, and Russian Alaska.<br />The author has provided us with a spectacular view of these different aspects of the North American colonial history, and should be read by anyone interested in the formation of America as it exists today or any aspect of its early creation.<br />Readers should be aware that since Taylor is looking at such an expansive area and time frames, the book is not a comprehensive study of early America, but is more like a detailed introduction, with many avenues worthy of further exploration in more detailed studies.	2002-12-08

In the book They Fought Like Demons, the authors have made an effort to tell the story of female participants in the Civil War from a different perspective - that of women as soldiers.<br />The book is not terribly long, and has numerous stories of women participating in the war, but it was evident to me quite early that the study focuses on only a few different individuals, with tidbits about other women added to make the author's points.  I give the book only three stars because I do not think that the authors delve deeply enough into questions of how women fought.<br />There is no question that this is a valuable book, and a story that needed to be told, but I do not believe that the book addresses the critical question of how valuable women were in the war effort.  It does satisfy, in a strong way, the need to understand that women were indeed patriotic, and had a desire to fight to preserve (or create) their country.  However, I believe that there are too many instances of &quot;this woman suffered an unknown fate&quot;, or mere mentions of an &quot;unknown woman&quot; participating in the battle and discovered as the burial detail performed their grim tasks.<br />I recommend this book to anyone that is looking for an understanding of women's participation in the civil war on an &quot;outside of the house&quot; front, but I do not recommend the book if you're looking for an understanding of women's doings in the midst of battle.	2002-12-04

The book is written from the British perspective, but I did not find it to display any preference for the British or the Americans. Instead, I found the book to be simply an accounting of the events during the revolutionary period.<br />Hibbert's research is outstanding, and his writing style is, in my opinion, fantastic. I'm looking forward to reading other books by this same author.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the American Revolution or anyone who wants to see a perspective not usually seen here in America about the war.	2002-11-28

So said Carl Von Clauswitz in his treatise &quot;On War&quot;.  When reading this book, it becomes painfully obvious that war really is a continuation of politics - the generals and the politicians dictate the war, but the soldiers in the trenches dictate the flow.<br />Stanley Weintraub has told us the story of a fascinating truce declared by the soldiers over the Christmas Holiday in 1914.  His writing is easy to follow, and the story makes you feel as if you are there.<br />Although it seems that the same premise resurfaces numerous times during the book, this is to illustrate Weintraub's point that the soldiers themselves decided to make this truce happen, not the Generals.  I found the variations on the theme interesting to read, and especially interesting to understand how widespread this action really was, rather than a single group of soldiers declaring an informal truce.<br />I personally disagree with the conclusions reached from this study; I do not believe that had the truce continued and ended the war at this point that history would have been altered in the drastic fashion that Weintraub writes of.<br />I recommend this book to all who have the desire to see the humanistic side of soldiers in wartime.  I encourage those who have interest in what might have happend to read the last chapter especially carefully to see if you agree or disagree with the author's conclusions.	2002-11-21

I found the book interesting and engrossing, though Davies had a tendancy at times to divert off to a tangent that does not seem to be related to the topic at hand.  Most of the topics he includes in the book give the reader a better understanding of how critical this transcontinental journey really was in forming modern America.<br />Davies' research is top-notch; he relies on primary sources including journals and newspaper accounts written at the time of the events.<br />The book is a great chronicle of early 20th Century Americana from a social perspective, including the trials and tribulations faced by the individuals during the cross-country journey.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the formation of modern America's motor age, but if you're only interested in understanding the Army's piece in this, you should consider skipping this book, because it doesn't do much with the military piece, despite the fact that the U.S. Army was responsible for the motorcade.	2002-11-11
