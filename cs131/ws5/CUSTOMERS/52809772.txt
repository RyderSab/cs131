I didn't find any of the writing funny, the descriptions were painfully hackneyed, and there were so many mechanical errors I found myself actually defacing a library book to correct the rampant unwarranted semicolons and missing commas.  There's more, of course - the plastic characterization, the embarrassing sex scenes, and the meandering plot, for instance - but I think I've made myself clear.  I'd read a few pages before you seriously considering buying this.	2004-10-05

My objection here was to the hero - not that he was unpleasant, just that he wasn't well-portrayed as a nerd.  The charm of Nerd in Shining Armor was the metamorphosis of the hero into a hero.  Here it seemed to me that Harry was already there.  This may be due to the fact that the plot was so overwhelming that none of the characters really got deep enough for my tastes. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book, no doubt about it.  It was a pleasant way to spend a Sunday afternoon, and the writing was smoother than I recall the first one being.  That said, it read like a typical romance novel, rather than an addition to the genre.  I recommend it absolutely, but I hope in the next book, the nerd is just a little bit nerdier.	2004-09-13

This seemed like a nice mixture, but it was a struggle for me to finish it.  I found the heroine so grating, the dialogue so ridiculous, and the humor so unfunny it was painful.  Jokes like calling Sinclair &quot;Sink Lair&quot; were not funny to me the first time, and by the tenth, well, I was nigh homicidal.  I see the intent, but for me it fell alarmingly flat.<br />That said, there are so many positive reviews that obviously I am in the minority.  My suggestion would be that you check out a few pages of it before you buy.  If you find her sense of humor entertaining, then you'll enjoy the book.  If not, well, put it back down, as I wish I had.  Your mileage may vary, as always.	2004-06-25
US	52809772	R23PORFEMVOQD5	0060929952	482695367	Five Fortunes	Books	2	5	7	N	N	Overwhelmingly Stereotypical	I have read a couple of Beth Gutcheon's other books, and was pleasantly surprised to stumble across this one in the library.  The plot is a nice idea.  Other reviewers have objected to the predictability of it, but that didn't bother me.  I don't mind a little comfortable predictability.<br />What did bother me was the characterization.  To read it, you would think that neither the authors nor the characters had ever stepped foot outside their houses before.  An eighty year-old woman?  Why, she's as old as Methuselah!  A woman who is six feet tall?  A giantess!  Pants would only come to her knees!  A woman who weighs 180 pounds?  She's practically a hippopotamus!  Etc, etc, etc.  The endless references the characters make to each other (I'm being generous and presuming it's the characters, the 3rd person omniscient view makes it difficult to tell) left me stymied.  Who would call an interesting elderly woman an old bag, or an overweight teenager an elephant, and if they did, why would I waste my time reading a book about such an unpleasant person?<br />I can recommend Beth Gutcheon as a writer, I just can't recommend this book.	2004-06-20

In the hands of a better writer, this attempted revision of Catcher might have been good, maybe even in the hands of this writer five years from now it will be good, but as it stands, I was underwhelmed.<br />The characterization is sketchy, the observations unilluminative, and the point missing.  There are better examples of this story out there, and I found myself resentful that I had forced myself to finish the entire thing.	2004-06-11

Though some people may find that disappointing, as we rely on Red Dress Ink for a chick lit fix, others, myself included, will enjoy this book for what it is, minus expectations.<br />Weinreb is a good writer, and it was refreshing to read an RDI book without counting the typos and grammatical errors on every page.  The characters have a tendency to blend, especially if you read it in one sitting, as I did, but since they mostly come across as &quot;everyman&quot;, it is forgivable.  I liked the various vignettes giving insight into the men who seem nice but ultimately treat their partners poorly - the shock jock in particular stood out to me.  I didn't find it particularly funny, at times it is rather depressing, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.	2004-06-09

It is richly written, and often I could almost smell the bread baking, or see Wyn's tiny cottage, or imagine the sound of the rain or the snow.  The characters have some nice moments, and while they are not perfectly sketched, they were well-drawn enough for me to care about what happened to them.  At first I found the jumping around in time to be jarring, as it was not clear why she was going back in time, but soon I began to look forward to those moments, because the descriptions were so lovely.  I cannot wait to read Hendricks' second novel.	2004-06-08

The characters range from thinly sketched to utterly caricatured, and the town, which is a character in itself, is never fully fleshed out.  The plot meanders, though not unpleasantly, and all in all it reads like Tim Burton and Maeve Binchy decided to write a book together.<br />I can't precisely decide if I liked it or not, but it held my interest.	2004-06-06

Lisa Maria has had to move home to live with her parents, because Lisa Maria is having some problems.  Lisa Maria might just find a guy to fall in love with, though, which would be good, because Lisa Maria wants to be in a relationship.<br />You'd better really like the name Lisa Maria, because it is repeated ad nauseum, even in places where a perfectly good pronoun would do.  Thus far, I haven't been able to make it past Chapter Two, because the constant statements of Lisa Maria's name have driven me nuts.  I give it two stars because there might be some good stuff later in the book.  Maybe you'll be able to find it.	2004-06-03

I don't really have any feelings one way or the other about what Karyn did to get into or out of debt.<br />What I do have strong feelings about is her complete inability to construct thoughtful sentences.  I made it through the first couple of chapters, and while the story itself was mildly interesting, the deadly thud of the repetitive sentences just made my head ache far too much to continue.<br />Subject verb direct object.

But this is not entirely a bad thing.  While his early work had fast-moving stories that kept you reading, the dialogue was often stilted, the characters poorly drawn, and the descriptions hackneyed.  That said, they were darn good reads.<br />The Last Juror is a good read too, but if you pick it up expecting him to rehash The Firm, you'll be disappointed, as witnessed by the number of negative reviews.  Personally, I was pleased by the developments in his style.  I spent Part 1 being sure I had read this book before.  And I had; it bears great resemblance to his earlier work.  Part 2 is where it becomes poetic, an homage to slow, small-town Southern life, and the improvements in Grisham's actual wordsmithing become evident.<br />Part 3 is the weakest - it feels rushed to wrap things up, and the ending was fairly dull.  But I was entranced by his descriptions and pleased by how rich and clear Clanton became.<br />Look, if you want to read The Firm, or A Time to Kill, read them.  No one will think less of you.  But if you want to chart this author's progress, this book is an excellent example.	2004-05-19

At first the shifting perspectives bothered me, but soon I grew to love all three characters, and genuinely cared about what happened to them.<br />Keyes does a truly excellent job of weaving together their stories.  There is never the event I was dreading - some major calamity that brings them all together into some enormous brawl.  Instead, the intersections and parallels of their lives are far more subtle, and their highs and lows are nicely timed with each other's.<br />It's nice to see that sometimes chick lit can be truly intelligent.	2004-05-18

Their 2004 offerings have ranged from mediocre to tremendously awful, but Bombshell is not great just by comparison.  It's great, period.<br />As a heroine, Grace is believable and tangible.  Her problems are real, and the way she deals with them is refreshing.  There are no pat solutions, though there is a happy ending.<br />I particularly enjoyed the romance that blossoms in the book.  Though the characters have baggage, it is well-written and defies predictability, which, in this genre, is difficult to do.<br />Lynda Curnyn, whose previous two novels I had not particularly enjoyed, is really on to something here.  RDI, are you listening?  This is the kind of book you should be publishing.	2004-05-16

The idea of a woman who accepts her size, plus the bonus of falling for a movie star - it seemed like my perfect book wrapped into one.  Honestly, I wanted to like it.<br />But I didn't.  I couldn't even finish it.  Other reviewers have mentioned much of what I found frustrating - the inconsistency of the heroine's character, the jarring inclusion of the columns that does nothing to further the plot or the characters, the confusing writing, the uninteresting secondary plots.  Gah.  It's clear that what the author really wants to be writing are cookbooks and self-help books.  She should do that instead.<br />I'll add a complaint - the clumsy writing made the ending way too clear.  When I quit halfway through, I checked the ending, and I was right.<br />There were some funny bits at the beginning, for which I was grateful, and at least it wasn't plagued by the spelling errors and typos that many other RDI books have been (except for &quot;movie premier&quot; - teehee!), but overall, I was heartily disappointed.<br />Is chick lit this tapped out already?	2004-05-15

At times, it is tempting to forget that it is fictional.  I truly liked the twists at the end, because of what they meant for Russia.<br />The negatives - the writing is at times clunky, particularly when the author moves out of the past and into the present. The endless translation of Russian phrases in conversation got tiresome, but I do speak Russian, so maybe that was just me.  What I hope is fixed in another edition is the handful of typos and errors - e.g., 'flare' for 'flair', 'engineerng' for 'engineering'.  It made the book seem...unprofessional.<br />I thought this book was charming, and I recommend it.	2004-04-22

It's a sexy, mindless beach read, and if you go into it with those expectations, I doubt you will be disappointed.<br />Sure, there are problems.  The heroine is at times condescending and unlikeable, and as another reviewer mentioned, the hero was too good for her.  The writing is clunky and crude at times, and the plot chugs along clumsily.<br />That said, I couldn't put it down.  Sometimes there's room in your beach bag for a pointless and poorly-written fantasy, and this fits the bill.	2004-04-20

There are even a few amusing scenes.<br />Sadly, those scenes are few and far between.  The novel reads as though the author wanted to create a primer on Jewish life, which, if you already know a great deal about Jewish life, is alternatingly pedantic and dull.  The conflicts did not draw me in, and I genuinely did not care what happened to the characters.<br />I give the book three stars because it is competently written, and that's something in the genre, but overall, I can't recommend it.  Just too boring.	2004-04-17

Want more?  How about the stilted dialogue, lifeless characters, shifting motivations, poorly chosen point of view and awkward stereotyping?    Since the author is only 25, I can give her a break.  Very few people can write themselves out of a paper bag before they're 30.  The people who cannot be forgiven are the RDI editors, who are allowing more and more shlock to slip through each month.

She didn't let me down.  As usual, her knack for details and subplots is excellent, creating a tremendously engaging story.  Though it was clear to me who I sympathized with, I nonetheless found myself questioning my own moral principles, something I remember doing with Mercy, The Pact, and Salem Falls as well.<br />I've become accustomed to Picoult's end-of-novel twists, but the series of events at the end of this one left me reeling.

When you could not admit to anyone at the wedding that your dress was hideously expensive and uncomfortable, the bride was a self-centered, irrational witch, and you didn't want to be there at all, it's nice to read someone else's horror stories.<br />None of this, however, makes up for the dully repetitive sentence structure, the painfully clumsy dialogue, and the lifeless characters.

It is absolutely riveting, which is strange, because none of these women has a truly earthshattering day.  Yet somehow, each one of these diaries or excerpts is a story in and of itself, and I found myself caught up in the trivialities of their daily lives.  From sippy cups and string cheese to chocolate cravings to memorials to lost loved ones, each one of these women has so many stories to tell.<br />Some ones that stick with me - the newly widowed woman writing her entries to her late husband, the funeral home director going to pick up a dead man and meeting his wife, the president of NOW cuddling with her children, a 60 year-old woman getting her GED, and the barista at Starbuck's with the lovely metaphors for her line of work.  And oh so many more.<br />What is nice about this book is that you could read it in bits and pieces (bathroom reading), or inhale it in one greedy gulp, as I did.  I recommend it highly.	2003-11-09

It was, however, interesting enough to keep me up far past my bedtime to finish it, and funny enough that trying to suppress my laughter succeeded in waking up my boyfriend, sleeping beside me.  It is a rare thing, I find, that I book will genuinely make me laugh out loud, and if for no other reason, I recommend this book.  <BR>The plot is hackneyed by this point in the development of chick lit, featuring Girl Who Cannot Get Over Ex-Boyfriend Who Has Moved On And Is Clearly Wrong For Her Anyway, along with another reliable trope, Mysterious Internet Stranger Who Just Might Be The One, and for good measure: The Big Lie That May Get In The Way Of True Happiness.  But most of us are not reading these books for original plotting.  We are reading these for escapism, which this provides nicely.<BR>The writing is excellent - the author's comic background shows clearly in the perfect timing of the jokes.  The characters range from charming to dull, but I found none of them offensive.  And as I mentioned, it can be laugh-out-loud funny, which is a great pleasure.

First off, let me say this is NOT a book that would interest kids under, say, 15.  <br />Then again, I doubt this book would interest anybody.  The fact is, it's boring.  There is no discernable arc to the story, simply a group of events and a late-breaking attempt at a plot.  The dialogue is clumsy and long-winded.  I found myself alternately disgusted and bored by the characters.  All of them are difficult to sympathize with, but are not fleshed out enough to be unpleasant in the charming way of Catcher in the Rye or Confederacy of Dunces.  The politics are also troubling, while the intention is obviously good, the execution makes all the characters distasteful.<br />The author is a headmaster of a school in North Carolina, and I found myself wondering how his community reacted to this book.

Her job, while dull, is secure and well-paying.  Her friends are fun and supportive.  There are vague allusions to her having a desire to write, which later morphs into a desire to publish a magazine, but those are offhanded interludes between the endless drinking and parties she goes to.

More than once while reading this book, I found myself moved to tears.  My situation was very different from Swallow's, but that's what makes the book so touching: her ability to really capture her own emotions during a tumultuous time and lay them bare.  Rather than being self-pitying, as some of the more vitriolic reviewers have accused her of being, I believe that her ability to separate herself from her emotions well enough to write about them so effectively deserves commendation.<br />Whether your family and friends support your decision to divorce or not, it is a lonely, difficult time.  It was worth every penny I spent on this book to hear that I am not alone in feeling the things I am.  If that means I am wallowing in self-pity, so be it.

Her suggested responses to people who make rude or uninformed remarks about your size fall into the category of  - ooh, I wish I'd said that - except now you can!<br />This is a great and knowledgeable resource on both size and sexuality, and I thank Hanne for writing it.  Stay fabulous!	2001-03-11

Cyberville and My Tiny Life are really the only two worth reading.  Horn has an amazing ability to step back far enough from the community she is part of in order  to do a sociological analysis of it.  It's incredibly readable, very human,  but a still-relevant look at the way we form communities and relationships  online.	2000-05-31

It's outdated, and I can't imagine it was very useful even when it was current.  Moore seems to utterly miss the point of most of the internet, and the fact  that his &quot;research&quot; is concentrated in the insular world of  USENET only makes his view narrower.  The only entertaining parts of the  book are 1) the cover, and 2) his utter incomprehension of cybersex and  &quot;how to do it&quot;.  But neither of those are worth purchasing the  book for.  Go for &quot;Cyberville&quot; or &quot;My Tiny Life&quot;  instead.	2000-05-31

This book has really allayed my fears.  The author gives detailed examples of ways to teach literature, grammar,  etc, from plot diagrams to discussion questions, all based on standard  school curriculum.  The specificity and references to texts makes the  information about instruction ideas that much better.  In addition, the  companion website and parts of the text give a more holistic view of the  profession, its issues, and challenges.  I *highly* recommend this book,  particularly to new English teachers.  Thank you, Jim!	1999-10-14

My first frustration with this book was that it is definitely geared towards public school teachers and the elementary grades.  While this obviously has its  audience and its place, as a high school teacher in an independent school,  I wish I'd known that before I ordered it.<br />Other than that, I felt as  though I'd been promised specificity and gotten nothing but vague  generalizations.  Other than very strict instructions on shaking the  students' hands the first day of school, I felt as though it was an  introduction.  Don't do fun activities, set down classroom rules! - they  say.  Okay, I say, give me some examples of classroom rules!  Unfortunately, they don't.  And as for the admonition that school should  not be fun - you've got to be kidding me.  I'm a teacher, not a drill  instructor.  Lighten up.  If you've read &quot;The Shopping Mall High  School&quot;, you'll be alarmed at their students as consumers model, which  seems outdated and dangerous.  Their examples of teachers using the ideal  of success as a motivation are well-intentioned, but disingenuous.  I'm not  trying to sell my students an education.<br />I'd target this book's  audience not as *every* teacher, but as public school, elementary grade  teachers with five to ten years of experience.	1999-09-20
