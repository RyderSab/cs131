I realised within 15 minutes that I had Asperger's Syndrome, and suddenly a lot of problems that I had experienced, mainly social in nature, were explained.<br /><br />In his book, Dr Attwood attempts to explain AS to the neuro-typical (NT) person, mainly parents and.or associated carers. As an AS sufferer, I found Dt Attwood had a deep understanding on the syndrome and the way it affects people. The book has a lot of practical value, and his insights and associated advice are extremely well thought out.<br /><br />One of the overriding themes of the book is Dr Attwood's positive outlook for AS sufferers, and he emphasises that it can be overcome with time and perseverence. I found this approach refreshing from the outlook presented in other tomes for AS, which suggest that AS sufferers must accept the inherent limitations imposed on them by the AS. I feel that the majority, if not all, of AS sufferers can overcome the condition. All people go through learning curves in life, and must 'ride uphill' to get there. For AS sufferers, the hill is merely longer and steeper. Dr Attwood makes this point very well, and I'd like to quote a passage from his book (p183):<br /><br />'The author has met many adults with Asperger's Syndrome who have described how in their late twenties or thirties they eventually managed to intellectually grasp the mechanisms of social skills. From then on the only people who knew of their condition were their family and those who knew them intimately.'<br /><br />I found this statement one of the most uplifting of the book, not to mention very true.<br /><br />Another important component of the book are the emotional and social skills exercises recommended for young children. As an AS sufferer myself, I cannot stress the importance of early diagnosis. It prevents much disappointment and heartache in later life.<br /><br />This is the authoritative text on AS, and required reading for any who has, or is associated with someone who has, Asperger's Syndrome. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.elf, I cannot stress the importance of early diagnosis.

The end result is generally a fairly brief book that is light on detailed descriptions. <br /> <br />Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover couldn't be further from that defintion. <br /> <br />While written from the shooting script, the book adds at least a viewable 'hour' onto the actual film, describing the extra scenes in wonderful detail. <br /> <br />Stover's style is carried on from 'Shatterpoint', and he divides the book into 3 distinct sections, with each section titled with a clear, distinct and logical division between each. <br /> <br />I found his descriptions of the characters, particularly Obi-Wan to be spot on. He incorporates small sections where he describes 'This is how is feels to be (character)'. In this sections, he really gets down to the essence of the character, and defines them brilliantly. He nailed every character, Kenobi, Anakin, Padme, Grievous, Windu and countless others. Stover clearly has a soft spot for Mace Windu, and follows on from Mace's previous outing in 'Shatterpoint' to his fateful confrontation with Darth Sidious. This confrontation, and Anakin's subsequent betrayal, were amongst the best written in the book. <br /> <br />Stover shows a deep and thorough understanding of Star Wars lore, particularly the precepts of the Jedi Order, and the way in which explores what it means to actually be a Jedi. The way he described Obi-Wan Kenobi, after learning of the massacre of the Jedi Order, is beautifully tragic. And int he final scenes, when Kenobi leaves Anakin to burn on Mustafar, Stover describes it as 'leaving it to the will of the Force', a succint explanation for what becomes one of the major plot points of the sequel saga. <br /> <br />As Star Wars fan of some experience, I didn't expect to be surprised by the Episode III novel. I was wrong. Stover explores thestory of Episode III in so much more detail than the film, particlarly in regards to the nature of the Force itself, and Yoda's recognition of the cloud of the dark side, failure of the Jedi Order, and why Luke and Leia were not trained as traditional Jedi. These are all 'big picture' issues in the Star Wars saga, and set the scene for the sequel series. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to any Star Wars fan.	2005-09-30

Given that the majority of young AS people would end up at college, this book is essential reading. <br /> <br />It outlines a lot of the challenges faced by AS students in college, particularly social challenges. Many of these things are second nature to non AS students, but to the AS students a lot of these things take time and effort to understand and put into practice. <br /> <br />The book is written in a very simple and concise manner, and clearly goes through every logical step of any argument or situation (which is vital for AS sufferers). <br /> <br />That being said, this isn't any sort of 'all answer' of 'cure' book to AS, simply because nothing like that exists. It's simply a handbook that contains practical advice and tips for the AS student. <br /> <br />However, one of the overriding themes of the book was the emphasis on therapy and counselling for the AS student. It seemed as if the end of every paragraph had the recommendation 'see your therapist' or something similar. I grew tired of hearing that point. <br /> <br />Personally, I am a self-diagnosed AS student, a conclusion I reached after, quite by accident, hearing Dr Tony Attwood speak on television one day. I am only just now, almost at the end of my tertiary education, looking into AS in great detail. I only wish that I had had this book when I had first started at university. It would have saved me from a lot of embarrassing moments and awkward situations. However, I draw confidence from the fact that a lot of the methods and tips given in this book I actually developed on my own, before I had any idea about AS. <br /> <br />I personally feel that AS is more common that currently thought (about 1 in 250 people), and that as research into AS continues, we will begin to understand more and more about the syndrome. I hope to one day see programs in schools (particularly at theprimary level) to recognise AS in students at a young age and help them deal with the condition.  <br /> <br />This book is required reading for anyone who has, or knows somebody who has, Asperger's Syndrome. <br />	2005-09-01
US	49538119	R2LWCZNM8Y8ZHV	0345478274	13456449	Hard Contact (Star Wars: Republic Commando, Book 1)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Awesome	'Star Wars: Republic Commando - Hard Contact' is definitely one of the best Star Wars books that I have ever read. <br /> <br />The tag of 'official game tie-in' normally means that a book has been published merely as a money making exercise in an attempt to milk a Lucas license for all that it's worth. This book, however, is well worth the read. <br /> <br />The book has almost no linkages whatsoever to the common Star Wars characters, indeed nobody from the Star Wars movies appears in this book. <br /> <br />Instead, it focuses on a group of Clone Commandos sent on a dangerous mission behind enemy lines, and a young Jedi Padawan that they meet up with. <br /> <br />The story is brilliantly written, and the characters are quite engrossing. The central clone commando, Darman, is a great character. The chemistry between him and Etain (the Padawan) is fantastic, and hints at something deeper than friendship. <br /> <br />The characters portrayed here are screaming out for reappearances in later Star Wars books, particularly Darman. Here's hoping that we see them again. <br /> <br />From a technical perspective, Karen Traviss's writing is up there with the likes of Tim Zahn or Matthew Stover. Her military background gives her excellent insight into military operations and the life of a solider. <br /> <br />I found that the story of the clone soldiers had similarities to that of the clone soldier 'Nate' from 'The Cestus Deception', which was another fantastic novel. If you like reading about these universal soldiers, then 'Hard Contact' is definitely a book for you. <br /> <br />The one qualm that I had with this book was the ending. While I don't wish to give anything away about the plot details, I did find that the mission was achieved a little too easily. <br /> <br />But it's a solid read, and well worth the money. I highly recommend 'Hard Contact' to any Star Wars fan. <br />	2005-03-28
US	49538119	R35DVY4X2OPT20	0345428528	713415479	The Unifying Force (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 19)	Books	1	28	37	N	N	Glad it's over	While this review comes under the novel 'The Unifying Force', I am writing it more as a review of the entire NJO series. <br /> <br />'The Unifying Force' is actually a well written novel, penned by one of my favourite authors, James Luceno. The novel ties together a lot of plot points very well, and provides a fitting ending to the series. <br /> <br />That being said, I disliked the NJO series as a whole. The books have shown a savage invasion of known 'Star Wars' space, by a ruthless and extremely violent enemy. Right from the start, the writers seemed to WANT to violate Star Wars lore, with the deaths of Chewbacca and Anakin Solo, the destruction of the planets Ithor and Coruscant (among others), and, finally, the destruction of the New Republic. <br /> <br />The writing of the NJO novels themselves seemed very basic and elementary, and the series was obviously written to accommodate younger readers around the 10-12 years of age literacy level. Such destruction and violence are often entertaining to younger people who do not understand the full implications of such acts, and have never really trusted in something enough to be saddened when it's ripped away. <br /> <br />For older Star Wars readers such as myself, such violations of the Star Wars story are distasteful. I read a great deal of the initial New Republic novels, from the Zahn trilogy to the Zahn duology, and everything in between. While those novels had their ups and downs, for the most part I found them very entertaining reading, and I read with fascination as the Empire crumbled and the New Republic, having struggled in it's infancy, grew to thrive. Events such as Han and Leia's marriage and subsequent children, Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic, the establishment of the Jedi Academy, the Black Fleet crisis and the peace treaty with the Empire were interesting and logical extensions of the story presented in George Lucas's initial 3 films (Episodes IV, V and VI). <br /> <br />The NJO seriesripped down a lot of this work, with much of the known galaxy falling under the oppressive heel of an alien race that views pain as something akin to religion. These new aliens enslaved people by the use of parasitic seeds implanted inside of them, rendering the hosts susceptible to influence, but also causing the hosts ever increasing pain as the seeds grew within them, eventually driving the hosts into insanity before the seeds would hatch. This is merely an example of the 'new' aliens and what they inflicted on the galaxy. <br /> <br />The NJO series, in addition to crushing what past novels built up, also featured excessive and bloodthirsty violence. While violence and action have always been part of the Star Wars story, the NJO took it to a new, and distasteful, level. Reading about these acts (such as the before mentioned parasitic enslavement of people) isn't entertaining or interesting at all, and I actually felt sick to my stomach while reading parts of the NJO novels. It's no surprise that Timothy Zahn and Kevin J. Anderson, two of the most respected Star Wars authors, kept their distance from the entire NJO series. <br /> <br />I'm glad that 'The Unifying Force' has finally ended the NJO saga, although I suspect that the damage done to the Star Wars saga is irreparable. I'm immensely saddened to see what has happened to Star Wars, which used to be a story that I loved and eagerly awaited each new novel. <br /> <br />While 'The Unifying Force' is a good novel by NJO standards, and with all due respect to Mr Luceno, there can be no going back on what the NJO series has done to Star Wars. I merely see it as the end to a miserable saga, and I'm glad that it's over. <br /> <br />I personally believe that the Star Wars publishers should have ended the Star Wars publications with 'Vision of the Future', from that fantastic Timothy Zahn duology. I believe that showing a peace treaty between the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant would have been a fitting endto the saga, but that is a matter of opinion. <br /> <br />I don't recommend 'The Unifying Force', and the entire NJO series for that matter, to anyone.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-14

The idea of dead zones just didn't work for me. And Starfleet was portrayed as a =n organisation that employed loony PR spin doctors to calm the public. Such a concept is totally contrary to the Starfleet that we all know. <br /> <br />Secondly, the characterisations seemed off. Picard didn't seem like the man we all know from TNG and the movies. <br /> <br />I read half the book, but was so disgusted with it that I stopped reading and threw it out. <br /> <br />That being said, I enjoyed previous Dave Galanter works. 'Battle Lines' was a fantastic Voyager book. Dave also provided an email address int hat book, and was very gracious in replying to my email. I believe that he is a talented Star Trek author, but he has missed the mark with this book. Better luck next time. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time on this book, but don't disregard Galanter's other works.	2004-12-14
US	49538119	R3652MUYFTXYYJ	0743463757	386633957	Well of Souls	Books	3	5	10	N	N	Is this the 24th century?	After reading this book, I honestly wonder if these are 24th century characters. I'll give you a few examples of the characters: (Spoiler warning) <br /> <br />-The captain is a divorcee who lost the child custody battle. She drinks too much and has severe problems in delegating responsibility to junior officers, probably due to unresolved grief over the death of her former XO and lover. <br /> <br />-The science officer has been horrifically scarred by a shuttle accident and also bear significant emotional scars, yet is made acting XO of the ship. <br /> <br />-The current XO has a shady background, which he covered up to enter Starfleet. In this story, Starfleet Intelligence and criminal organisations use his background as leverage against the man. Is this the sort of man who should be on the Federation flagship? <br /> <br />-The captain's son has a suicidal friend. <br /> <br />-The book also goes into the horrible details of the illicit drug trade at the fringes of the Federation. I thought that those things didn't happen in the Federation. <br /> <br />-The characters frequently lie to each other, and also frequently use coarse language. <br /> <br />The above points sum up my problems with this story. I found it to be laboured, disjointed and drawn out. The characters didn't resemble 24th, or even 23rd century character that we saw in the TV series. <br /> <br />I understand the principles of dramatic writing, and, for the purposes of creating drama, characters must fail, but what Bick has done here is too much. <br /> <br />On the plus side, the book was well written in a technical sense. The Starfleet details were spot on, and the scientific details were particularly good. Blick's treatment of the protostar formations showed that she obviously has a deep understanding of stellar physics. <br /> <br />Also, with regards to the characters, the one character that I did like was the psychiatrist, Dr Tyvan. I found Bick's treatment of him to be excellent, essentially he was a different take on the Deanna Troi character (who I also liked). <br /> <br />But overall, I found this book to be mediorce, and unreflective of 24th century values and qualities. Ilsa Bick certainly deserves more outings in the Trek universe, but I hope that next time she write a novel, the characters are a little closer to those on the TV series. <br /> <br />I only recommend you buy this book if you wish to complete the Lost Era series, otherwise look for something else to read.	2004-10-15

For example, many of the examples contain references to data tables, and data from those tables is utilised for the analysis. Often, the examples use data entries that are obviously wrong, and thus invalidate the rest of the example, forcing the student to rework the example. This can be found throughout the book, but luckily the examples aren't too hard to rework. <br /> <br />For anyone interested in the construction industry, I don't recommend you buy this book. Getting out on site is the best learning experience. You should only buy this book if you need to (eg, for an undergraduate university subject) and then sell if off at the conclusion of the subject.	2004-10-10
US	49538119	ROPC6OMNJ9NMV	0743471180	357396953	Star Trek: Enterprise: Daedalus	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Best Enterprise novel to date	'Daedalus' by Dave Stern is undoubtably the best Enterprise novel to date, and echoes with the hallmarks of great Trek. <br /> <br />The story of part 1 is centred around Charles 'Trip' Tucker, Chief Engineer of Enterprise and one of the leading actors in the show. <br /> <br />Basically, Trip and Hoshi are forced to abandon Enterprise in the cell ship after their ship is crippled and boarded in a sneak attack. From there, they are picked up by the opponents of the forces that took control of Enterprise, a desperate military organisation on the verge of collapse.  <br /> <br />This puts Trip in a delicate position, does he use his Starfleet technology on training to aid his new allies, even though it would violate the Prime Directive? <br /> <br />Matters are further complicated when it is revealed that Starfleet technology had a hand in starting the war, and that the enemy now have their hands on even more advanced technology in the form of Enterprise. <br /> <br />The story is exciting, gripping, and character centred, all the good things that you want from a Star Trek novel.  <br /> <br />The writing itself is a little unorthodox, and not quite like any previous form of Trek writing. Stern is a very factual, practical writer, and writes a novel with the minimum of verbose descriptions and the maximum of dialouge. This is not a bad thing, but it is different to previous authors. <br /> <br />The dialouge itself is extremely well done, and Stern really conveys the characters thoughts and intentions through it. One of my favourite scenes from the book is during Trip's initial meeting with Marshall Kairn, when Kairn puts the hard word on Trip about joining the Guild. The scene shows just how desperate things are for the Guild, and sets the scene for the rest of the book. <br /> <br />But overall it is a solid story, and definitely the best Enterprise novel to date.  <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and recommend it to any Star Trek fan.	2004-08-21

After a diplomatic request from a mysterious race, the two set off to aid an expedition to recover the Outbound Flight project, which was a mission launched during the time of the Old Republic. The importance of this is that the ship would contain a plethora of records from that period, particularly records concerning the Old Jedi Order that Luke knows so little about.<br />I won't go into any more plot details, but suffice to say, it is a very intruiging and exciting story, with plenty of action, and it ties into the prequel series very well, with some nice touches (the Jedi starfighter, and the droideka) to relate it back to that era.<br />That being said, I was disappointed by some parts of the book.<br />While Luke and Mara are interesitng characters (always have been) many of the others are not. The other major character is a man called Jinzler, a man with a family connection to one of the Jedi who left with Outbound Flight. Jinzler came from nowhere (in terms of the overall series) and I didn't really find him all that interesting. I think that this story may have worked better if it involved one of the other major characters from Star Wars.<br />I was also disappointed not to read anything more about Jorus C'Boath, who was one of the principal antagonists in the original Zahn trilogy.<br />The outcome of the mission doesn't reveal anything startling to Luke about the old Jedi, but the door has been left open for him to learn about it later on. I suspect that, after EpIII comes out and all the major plot points are tied up, Zahn may write a follow story to this one, perhaps revealing a little more to Luke about the old Jedi. But that's all speculation.<br />In my opinion, this is one of the best Star Wars books to come out in recent years, much better than that awful, bloodthirsty NJO series.<br />I recommend this book to all Star Wars fans, whether casual or serious.	2004-04-14

Where these errors arise, Ms Fonstad has made reasonable assumptions or compromises between the conflicting data, but none of them seriously detract from Tolkien's word in any way. As another reviewer said, this is testament to the creative genius of Tolkien, and his uncanny attention to detail that make the books so believable.<br />I highly recommend this book to any Lord of the Rings fan, as it is a fascinating book that clarifies the geography of Middle-Earth in a way that has never been done before.	2004-02-28
US	49538119	R31GMMHYRK3C3L	0743417518	697797469	Star Trek Voyager Companion	Books	4	11	12	N	N	A fine book, could have been better	A lot of the other reviews that I've read for this book have been very negative and dismissive of the publication. And while I agree, the book does have some faults, it isn't that bad. I suspect that the extremely negative reviews stem from the Voyager biast that many fans seem to have, but I won't discuss that. Here's what I thought of the book:<br />The Voyager Companion by Paul Ruditis follows all 7 years of the 4th incarnation of Star Trek, Voyager. The book is set out much like it's predecessor companions, giving details of each episode in production order, with accompanying stardates and production personnel and actors. The book does a fine job of giving all the details of the show, outlining the stories for each episode, and giving summaries at the end of the technical information and character development.<br />The book also features multi-page sections devoted to each of the cast members, occuring approximately one in each season, although some seasons feature two. The character sections are particularly good, and feature quotes from both producers and actors alike. <br />The Companion also includes a nice summary of Voyager's crew manifest, showing every named crewmember over the 7 years, with their accompany rank, affiliation (Starfleet or Maquis) and status (alive, dead, or departed the ship).<br />Where the book fails is with the behind the scenes information that made the other companions so good. Aside from the small introduction to each season and the character pages, there is virtually no behind the scenes information. And the comments of the production personnel are all positive, and do little to point out any mistakes in the show. Having such a sanitized book as this only goes on to prove that there were production problems with Voyager, problems that the producers want to hide. If the producers had the honesty to admit the problems with Voyager (there were some, not that many though) it would strengthen the show's repuation, at least in my mind.We're all human, we all make mistakes. Wisdom comes from accepting responsibility for mistakes and making provision for them not to occur again.<br />It would have been much more interesting to read a balanced view of the show, featuring detailed behind the scenes information in conjunction with the detailed episode data. <br />But overall, this is a fairly good book, and a fine tribute to the strength of the Voyager series. If you like Voyager, then you should read this book.	2004-02-02

If the stories from 'Prophecy and Change' and merely the 'early works' of these authors, then I shudder to think just how brilliant their writing will be when these men and women hit their prime.<br />The stories themselves are mastefully told, and are presented as stories being told by Jake to the young woman that came to see him in 'The Visitor', when Jake is an old man. <br />Each story is great, but the standouts are definitely 'Three Sides to Every Story', 'Foundlings', and 'Chiaroscuro'. Each of these stories are just brilliant, and cover the last 2 seasons of DS9, which was where the series really hit it's peak.<br />My only problem with this book was the last story, the Garak story by Andrew J. Robinson. I throughly enjoyed his previous work about Garak, entitled 'A Stitch in Time', but I did not enjoy his contribution to this book, entitled 'The Calling'. I found the story disjointed and at some points just plain confusing. Robinson made some reference to a play entitled 'The Dream Box' which I have never heard of. I'm guessing that this play is the step between 'A Stitch in Time' and 'The Calling', but I have never seen this play, so 'The Calling' was utterly confusing to me.<br />My only other negative point about this book was concerning a specific plot point. Please be warned, this paragraph contains spoilers. If you wish to avoid them, skip this paragraph. In 'Three Sides to Every Story', Ziyal gives Jake a precious Bajoran earring belonging to her mother, asking Jake to keep is safe for a while. After Ziyal's death, Jake goes to Ziyal's body and considers giving the earring back, but then decides that he should keep it, thus fufilling his promise to Ziyal. This was a wonderful piece of writing, but I think that the author could have gone a step further. The last part of the book is the conclusion of the meeting between Jake and the young woman that comes to see him. I believe that Ziyal's earring should have been mentioned there as still being kept safe by Jake. This would work in two ways, firstly, it would add weight the Jake-Ziyal story by making direct reference to it in the 'objective' sections at either end of the book. Secondly, it would help to reinforce the fact that Jake had an active role in these events. It's a fairly trivial point to be sure, but it was something that I felt should have been included in the story. But that is really a matter of opinion.<br />Overall, if you are a fan of DS9, either casual or serious, then you should buy this book. It's absolutely fantastic.	2004-01-26

The colony is conducting warp experiments in orbit of Earth, and one goes awry and sends the asteroid colony 200 light years away. What exactly happened here is not explained in any great detail, only that some sort of mysterious mishap sent them away. I found this a weak point of the book.<br />After establishing self-sufficiency, the colony is then swept up by the mysterious phenomenon from the Voyager episode 'One Small Step', which takes the colony over 200 000 light years away to the Small Megalanic Cloud, a small galaxy near the Milky Way.<br />The colony eventually establishies it's own culture and religion, and becomes increasingly warlike after several alien attacks, adopting a policy of 'kill or be killed', even if they aren't sure if the newcomers have hostile intentions.<br />The colony eventually becomes mobile, and conquers a primitive world. Although they arrive under a flag of peace and friendship, the colonists (now adopting the name Neyel) eventually enslave the primitive population, and later conduct a mass slaughter of the primitives on the world. The Neyel then expand their empire, building ships and conquering other worlds, eventually ruling over 30 or so worlds.<br />The Neyel a later drawn into conflict with the Tholians, when a mysterious phenomenon creates some sort of physical conduit between Tholian space and the conquered Neyel homeworld. The two races go to war, and then the Excelsior enters the story, attempting to find out the truth between the mysterious Tholian activities.<br />I won't reveal too much more, but suffice to say that the Excelsior and Captain Sulu are drawn into the situation, trying to broker a peace between two sworn enemies.  There's a good mix of action, diplomacy and character development, which makes the book a fairly good story, with the exception of several unexplained technical details from earlier in the story.<br />The writing itself isn't brilliant, as the writers seem very eager to show off their extensive volcabulary by using unusual words. If you want to read this book, I recommend you have a dictionary beside you.<br />The writers also let a few too many of their political views creep into their work:<br />-On page 86, the writers mention the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They describe is as: <br />'....reminded her of frightened Israeli soldiers with quivering trigger fingers. And her own desperate, demoralised cousins who had for decades counterattacked indiscriminately by strapping bombs to their bodies. Justifiable fear had motivated both sides.'<br />This statement is untrue. While they are correct about the Israeli soldiers being frightened, their decription of the Palestinian terrorists is not correct. What fear motivates them? I don't know. Most of them are young people from decent families who have fallen under the influence of evil people who fill these young minds with lies, creating an immense hatred of Israel. Justifying their actions by twisting the meaning of a normally peaceful religion, these people strap explosives to themselves and head into crowded public areas, and look to see where they can kill the most women and children. This is not justifiable fear, it is terrorism. But more to the point, why did the writers even mention this in their book? Star Trek has always dealt with serious issues, but the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not something that Star Trek should be exploring. It also involves religion, another topic that Star Trek steers away from.<br />I also found that the Excelsior crew seemed a little too eager to embrace the Neyel as long-lost cousins. The Neyel had conquered and enslaved the populations of any world that was close to them, and then used to resources of that world to expand their Empire further. This is what the Cardassians did to the Bajorans in the 24th century. These actions are not that of a race that the Federation should be instantly accepting with open arms. <br />In summary, I found the colonists and the eventual Neyel story to take away more from that plot than it gave. I believe that the writers would have been better off using another race from within the Milky Way galaxy, and exploring the Tholians a little more. <br />On other hand, the writers did a great job of exploring the Tholians a little more. I particularly liked the way that they described what the Tholians physically exist as, expanding on one glimpse of them in 'The Tholian Web' and several refrences to them over the years, the writers created an entire species from that.<br />But other than the flaws that I mentioned regarding the Neyel, this is a fairly good book. I thoroughly enjoyed the adventures of Sulu and crew, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the Lost Era series.	2003-11-10
US	49538119	RBG25CF9ER1KE	0345435419	595671727	Star Wars: Darth Maul, Shadow Hunter (Star Wars - Legends)	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Fast paced and a little weak	The subject header for this review pretty much sums up my thoughts regarding 'Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter'. The book is a story set just before Episode I, centred around Darth Maul and his activities just prior to the blockade of Naboo.<br />The story quickly falls into an action adventure involving a Jedi Padawan, an information broker, and the broker's droid, all trying to escape from Darth Maul in the Coruscant underworld. <br />The book progresses along in a quick and simple fashion, lacking the detailed style and grace of other SW works by Zahn or Anderson. The ending, while ultimately bad (as we all know, Darth Maul survives to see Episode I), is also somewhat satisfying.<br />The book had some interesting background information about the Jedi, particularly with regards to their training and discipline, and the Jedi Code itself was interesting, and was referred to a number of times by the Jedi in their thoughts.<br />Shadow Hunter was released around the time that Episode I came out, and many people expected a detailed background to the movie to be in this book. It isn't. While this book may satisfy younger readers and fans of action based stories, I believe that most fans will be dissapointed by this book. If you're looking for a good background book, read 'Cloak of Deception', which gives all the political manouverings pre-Episode I.	2003-10-08
US	49538119	R1KLJT0N3NRHWH	0743410246	307045695	4: Mission Gamma Book Four: Lesser Evil (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Mission Gamma)	Books	3	18	21	N	N	Simple and unsatisfying	The fourth book of the Mission Gamma series is, in my opinion, the weakest book of the series, and I was left feeling unsatisfied at the end. I also must warn people that this review does contain significant spoilers of the book itself.<br />The book continues from the previous books int her series, with the Defiant finally beginning to head home in this novel, yet even on their way home they are still passing through uncharted space.<br />There was also a rather large technical error at the beginning. The author claims that the Defiant and the probes it launched had charted over 1200 cubic light years of space. That figure is ridiculous, no ship the size of the Defiant could possible chart that much space in only 3 months. Even Voyager, which was faster than the Defiant, could only make 438 light years per year.<br />But to other things. The book launches into the Defiant picking up a strange signal in the Gamma Quadrant, a signal that the ship's commander, Elias Vaughn, has seen before, and he orders the ship to investigate the signal and also hides this form the rest of the crew.<br />Meanwhile in the Alpha Quadrant, we see two seperate story lines evolve, one centred on Joseph Sisko on Earth, and the other centred on the crew on Deep Space Nine. The first AQ (Alpha Quadrant) storyline shows Joseph Sisko settled into some sort of depression over the loss of both Ben and Jake, and the efforts of his daughter Judith to get him back into action. This plot line is fairly simple, yet the resolution involves an old series favourite, Miles O'Brien, and I found it to be the most enjoyable of the book.<br />The second AQ plot line is on DS9, and deals with the aftermath of the assassination of Shakaar and the hunt for the killer. At this stage, Colonel Kira leaves the station on a Federation starship following what they think is a cloaked vessel heading for Trill, which creates a third AQ storyline with Kira away from the station.<br />The Defiant storline in the Gamma Quadrant continues and shows the crew discovering the wreckages of both a Jem'Hadar and a Borg-assimilated ship crashed on a planet. The assimilated ship holds a link to Vaughn's past, which is interesting, and is later explained when Vaughn has a 'tell-all' session with Ezri Dax, revealing his full background and the devestating decision he made regarding Prynn's mother. While Vaughn's story is interesting, it is very simple and straightforward, and in some parts is very weak, although I did find the story of Prynn's namesake to be very touching. Personally, I was expecting something exciting, interesting and a downright throrough explanation of his past. Instead, we got a chapter with a very fast paced story showing the important points of Vaughn's life with regards to Prynn and Ruriko, which was disappointing.<br />The Defiant plotline quickly continues, and we see an incredible seen where a Borg drone attempts to assimilate a Founder. I found this scene both incredible and bizarre, even more so as it served no real purpose to the development of the story. In the end, Vaughn is forced to make a devestating decision all over again, totally destroying any development in the relationship between himself and Prynn.<br />The AQ plotlines continue, and the crew on DS9 make a startling discovery about an old enemy from TNG, the parasites from 'Conspiracy', which are in some way related to the Trill species. They also learn that the parasites have taken control over someone on the starship Kira is travelling on, leaving Kira to eventually save the day. Relating the 'Conspiracy' parasites to the Trill was a very nice twist indeed, probably th best in the book, a real credit to the writer(s).<br />The book finishes with the Defiat nearing the wormhole, Kira heading back to DS9, and Joseph Sisko heading to Bajor to be with Kasidy.<br />Several plotlines/characters developments didn't reach any meaningful conclusion, they were:<br />-The Andorian problems involving Shar, a bigpart of the 1st two novels, were forgetten about.<br />-The relationship between Quark and Ro was barely mentioned.<br />-Commander Mathias, station counselor, was nowhere to be seen. A shame really, I liked her character, and there was also supposed to be some mystery surrounding the Bajoran ancestral roots of her husband.<br />-The issues between Nog and Taran'tar didn't really come to a conclusion.<br />-Vedek Yevir was virtually non-existent during the plot, which was unfortunate considering the large part he'd played in the last book.<br />Overall, I found the book had been written in a very simple manner with very quick plot developments and resolutions, some of which seemed totally irrelevant to the story. This resulted in a very short book with large print, and the more I read it the more I got the impression that the whole thing had been a rush job. The book seemed closer to one of those 'junior' Star Trek books than anything else.<br />The Mission Gamma opening book, 'Twilight', was much slower and far more detailed, and yet the final book in the series is a rush job with very simple, very basic plot twists. All the work done by the previous books to mend the relationship between Vaughn and Tenmei is undone, and at the end the reader is left unsatisfied. I believe the authors may have been trying to set the scene for the next two books, but setting the scene for the next book at the expense of finishing the last book is not only bad writing, it also dishonours the rest of the series.<br />I was also interested to note that there was no 'about the author' section at the end of the book. Virtually every Star Trek book I have read contains one of these sections, and I enjoy getting some insight into the author and his/her interests and background. This is simply more evidence to a rush job.<br />If you've followed the Mission Gamma series so far, you may as well buy this book. If you're just a casual fan, forget about it, as this book just isn't worth reading.	2003-06-11
US	49538119	R1IHGU45JC83GE	0743445627	646144995	Mission Gamma Book Two: This Gray Spirit (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Mission Gamma) (Bk. 2)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Slow and steady	I tried to really sum up this book in my subject line, 'Slow and Steady', because essentially that is how the book is. Heather Jarman has written a great 2nd novel in the Mission Gamma series, and considering that it is her first book, it is a commendable achievement.<br />The story begins with the Defiant exploring the Gamma Quadrant, and they become trapped in some sort of nanotechnology minefield. A friendly races arrives to help them, called the Yrthny, and the Defiant heads back to their homeworld for repairs. In their efforts to the repair the Defiant, the crew become drawn into the internal affairs of the Yrthny, which is an interesitng political situation.<br />On DS9, the political manouverings continue, and we mainly see them from Kira's perspective. Into the plot also enters the Cardassians, led by Ambassador Natima Lang and Gul Macet, a close relative of the late Gul Dukat. Some old wounds are reopened, but above all we see the two races trying their hardest to achieve peace, yet some individuals are trying to disrupt that peace, which makes for interesting reading. I found Jarman's treatment of the Cardassians particularly refreshing, considering what they did. All too often during the tv series, the Cardassians, Dukat in particular, got away with horrendous crimes. Gul Dukat himself was a murderer, war criminal, and a rapist, a man who lied, tricked and decieved people, especially when he wanted to have intimate relations with a woman. He had several illegitimate children, and was willing to kill them (and their mothers) just to protect his career. In this book, Jarman tries to show just what some of the other characters thought about this sort of behaviour, especially with regards to Ziyal.<br />The plot doesn't move with great leaps and bounds, in both the Alpha and Gamma Quadrants. The book is also fairly light on the action, and while I didn't mind this, some readers may have other thoughts.<br />The story has a satisfying ending, but there is alsoa big shock on the way for certain characters.<br />While I found the story to be well written (Jarman is obviously well educated in both writing and Trek lore) it was verbose at times, especially when it came to details regarding the Yrthny. Often the Yrthny affairs were convoluted and confused, and I found them a little hard to make sense of, all the more so as they didn't contribute that much to the plot. The Andorian backstory was also a little dragged out, and while it was an interesting insight into their culture, it wasn't properly explained until much later in the book, which was frustrating.<br />In conclusion, I recommend this book to readers of the Mission Gamma series and DS9 series in general. If you're just a casual fan, this probably isn't the book for you.	2003-05-30
US	49538119	R2ZOS8Z1WPNRDG	0345456688	996145031	Tatooine Ghost (Star Wars)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Fantastic	If you've ever wondered over what Leia's thinking was regarding having children, this is the book for you.<br />Set on Tatooine shortly after the events of 'The Courtship of Princess Leia', the book details Leia's effort to buy an Alderaanian painting from the black market, a painting which includes a secret rebel communications code that, if found out, would cripple New Republic Intelligence Operations.<br />As expected, it isn't as simple as just buying the painting back, some Tatooine criminals become involved, then the Imperials are involved, and then the real fun begins. Needless to say, there is an adventure across Tatooine, during which Leia begins to discover the background of her father (Anakin) and grandmother (Shmi). Denning also explores a lot more about the characters from Episodes I and II, particularly Anakin's friends from Ep I. Denning also made some small exploration into the character of Obi-Wan Kenobi, who is also tied into the plot, and his time spent on Tatooine.<br />But essentially, the book revolves around Leia, particularly her relationship with Han. Both of them have been written to perfection in this book, to the point where you can actually 'see' them in your mind saying the lines. Denning also does an admirable job inserting Chewie into the various conversations, and again the characterisation is spot on.<br />The technical aspects of the book are also spot on, and I couldn't really fault Denning at all. His efforts to show how the heroes avoided detection on a technical side were also admirable, and made a lot of sense.<br />In short, if you're looking for a good Star Wars book set far away from those awful NJO novels (if you could call them that) then this is the book for you. Even for casual fans who don't know the story very well, this book would be a great read.	2003-04-22
US	49538119	RUA00R0J9F71L	0060975768	502570587	We Were Soldiers Once... and Young: Ia Drang--The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Superb	Without doubt, this is one of the best accounts of military history that I have ever read.<br />'We Were Soldiers' describes two separate engagements between the NVA and American forces in the Ia Drang valley in Vietnam. This battle, fought in 1965, was one of the first 'real' encounters between US and NVA forces, and it changed the Vietnam War from a political exercise to full fledged conflict. <br />Essentially, the book is divided into two stories, that of the soldiers that fought at Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray, and that of the soldiers that fought at LZ Albany, two locations in the Ia Drang valley. <br />The book is frighteningly honest about the harsh realities of war, and does an excellent job at showing the human cost of war. Lt. General Harold 'Hal' Moore writes in a very forthright and honest manner, and it is obvious he is someone that does not mince words, and I believe that every word in this book is truth.<br />The book isn't easy to read, and it certainly isn't a light, entertaining story. If anything, the book is closer to a history text, rich in detail and thoroughly referenced, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fascinating read. <br />But overall, what I admired so much about this book was the honesty of it. Nothing is withheld, all is told, typical of 'Hal' Moore. After reading this book, it is obvious to me that Hal is a man of the highest integrity and earned every star on his shoulder.<br />I am an Australian, and although the men at Ia Drang weren't from my country, I was still deeply moved after reading this book. Every man that served in that valley was a hero, and I admire them greatly. I recommend all Americans read this book, young and old.	2003-04-17
US	49538119	RS4BN1S34P06N	0345428501	87344379	Destiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14)	Books	2	4	10	N	N	Why did they kill the New Republic?	I will say this now, I do not like the New Jedi Order series.<br />That being said, I actually found Destiny's Way to be one of the better books of the series. <br />The book shows the shattered New Republic trying to come to grips with the loss of Coruscant to the Vong. Not just a simple conquest, but planet wide devestation.<br />The heroes have regrouped on Mon Calamari, and suddenly Admiral Ackbar re-enters the story. He was noticeably absent in the series up to Destiny's Way, and now he has come back onto the scene with a plan to defeat the Vong.<br />Character wise, the story is fairly sound, and I won't go into many details other than the fact that Han and Leia don't feature very prominently at all, which is a bit of a disappointment.<br />The moral dilemmas raised later on in the book are interesting, yet hardly surprising. Which makes me wonder why the NR didn't unleash the 'genetic super-weapon' earlier, maybe even before the fall of Coruscant.<br />But what I found most disturbing about the book was the fact that everyone seems to have given up on the New Republic, and it is quote 'torn to shreds by the savage Vong invasion'. I clearly remember reading about the New Republic being set up after the defeat of the Empire, and I read on through the various novel sagas as it grew and thrived. A lot of people died during the Rebellion to see the New Republic set up, and now we're being told the Republic was decaying, and it was best to start over.<br />My question is, why did the writers do this? I mean, they've already killed off Chewbacca (something which did not sit well with older fans), Anakin Solo, not to mention destroying Ithor and Coruscant. I think they've succeded in showing just how savage the Vong are, why don't they instead try and show the strength of the New Republic to withstand the onslaught? <br />And once again, as has been the trend for this series, the books are 'dumbed down', obviously written to accomodate for younger and less literate readers. The story is presented in an efficient and factual way, with none of the grace or style that people like Zahn use in their works. The writers also seem to enjoy making a point of the excessive violence in this series like some sort of mark of honour.<br />And on another point, why do these books contain so much bloody violence? Right from the start of the NJO series, we've seen countless incidents of bloodthirsty violence, was it really necessary? Star Wars has always avoided such things, and in fact, I think the most blood we ever saw was in ESB when Luke was scratched by the wampa ice monster.<br />All this has led to my higher than usual rating for NJO books (the usual being 1 star), to two stars, mainly because the story was at least somewhat interesting. <br />If you've been a diehard fan of this series, you'll certainly enjoy this book, but how anyone can enjoy a series that has violated Star Wars lore so much is beyond me.<br />For those, like me, who find this entire series a pathetic money-making exercise, I recommend looking into the new Clone war books that are coming out, back when the galaxy was more 'civilised'.	2003-03-28
US	49538119	RPKSKKPQAJUVB	0743437705	3849450	Star Trek Star Charts: The Complete Atlas of Star Trek	Books	4	141	145	N	N	Brilliant, but incomplete	Without doubt, this is the most important Trek publication since the Encyclopedia 1st came out.<br />This book features maps of the stars we have heard so much about in Trek, and a lot of others we've never heard of before.<br />There's a lot to the book, so I'll try to break it down:<br />The first section is sort of a galactic overview, showing overall maps (which are very interesting, as we see the extent of the Borg transwarp conduits, Vaawaur subspace tunnels and the Hirogen communications array. It then launches into a description of how the galaxy is broken down, and how the 'sector' is dervied. That little explanation is one of the best parts of the book.<br />We then see a 3D map (the only 3D map in the book) of the 4 sectors surrounding Sol, sectors that feature the major homeworlds such as Earth, Vulcan, Andor, Tellar and others.<br />The book then describes the classes for both stars and planets, both of which are very interesting and are based on real astrophysics, very well done indeed.<br />The book then goes on to show the various quadrants. The first quadrant shown in the Alpha Quadrant, and, believe it or not, this is one of the smaller sections in the book. Mandel shows the 'left' of the Federation, where the Cardassians, Breen, Ferengi and various others thrive. While it is a good map, I feel it was incomplete. I was looking forward to a detailed map of the Dominion War, yet Mandel fails to do that, and only designates a tiny area near Bajor as having been the battleground. Also, several important locations from the war are missing, such as: the Tyra system, Starbase 257, not to mention the site of the battle from 'Sacrifice of Angels'. Mandel also fails to show what Sisko was speaking of in 'By the Pale Moonlight' when he spoke of the Jem'Hadar often cutting through the Romulan Neutral Zone to attack the UFP. From this statement, I got the impression that the Cardassians/Romulans shared a common, or at least a fairly close, border. However, forthis to be the case, Cardassian space would have to have been further 'north' of the Federation, closer to the Romulan border. <br />The book then moves onto the Beta Quadrant, the quadrant that includes the Klingon and Romulan star Empire. This section was very well done, but my one real complaint was the size of the Klingon Empire. It was huge, almost as big as the Federation itself, which I found unrealistic. The Klingons may be powerful, but I really cant see them administering such a large Empire. Also, the location of Tygor Kor from 'Apocalypse Rising' was absent.<br />Both of these sections also paid little to no attention to the adventures of Kirk and Picard. I expected some charts of where those two intrepid adventurers had been around the Federation, yet there was nothing to be found. If anything, both the Alpha and Beta quadrant sections need to be expanded to show more of the Federation. Some worlds were missing, such as Ktaria IV, Beta Antares (where a secret Federation shipyard is supposably located) and El-Auria.<br />The next section, on the Gamma Quadrant, is the smallest section in the book, and also has a few errors. The scale of the map is obviously wrong, but that's just a typo. Mandel shows the geography fairly well, but he missed the nebula Garak and Worf encountered the Dominion fleet in in 'In Purgatory's Shadow', which was disappointing. Other than that the map was good.<br />The last quadrant shown in the Delta Quadrant, and it also has the most errors. Voyager's first yeat in the DQ is riddled with errors, and not just small ones. Errors such as putting the singularity from 'Parralax' far ahead of other locations is ridiculous, the black hole was in the 2nd episode! Voyager's trip to Rinax/Talax was totally forgotten about, and I get the feeling Mandel hasn't done his research properly.<br />The 2nd year is much better than the first, yet still contains a few of the placement errors in terms of Voyager's timeline.<br />The third year is much the same, but I actually found it very interesting, particularly in how the Nekrit Expanse was shown, well done Geoff.<br />As far as I can tell, the 4th year is error free, yet I would have liked to have seen Voyager's route through Borg space, and exactly where the 'Northwest passage' was. I would also have liked to have seen Arturis's homeworld, the Cataati homeworld, and the location of the planet species 8472 destroyed in 'Scorpion'.<br />The 5th season map contains numerous errors, but most of these aren't Geoff's fault. The 5th season episodes were shown out of order, so often the stardates went forward and backwards. Hence, Geoff's maps are out of sync with 'true' stardate time. Normally this wouldn't be such a big problem, but 5th season had nearly 35 000 light years of 'extra' travel, so the difference of a few few stardate units can mean 10 000 ly. Also, some locations were missing, such as Malon Prime, Devore Prime, the ice planet Voyager crashed on in 'Timeless', not to mention the Ankari homeworld (although this world may be somewhere near where Voyager was in 2371). I would also have liked to have seen the location of the Borg unicomplex Seven and co went to, and also the location of the homeworld of species 10026 from 'Dark Frontier'.<br />Season 6 is shown fairly well, but again has a few placement errors, such as the Vaadwaur homeworld. <br />Season 7 is relatively flawless, but I would like to have seen the actual nebula Voyager went into in 'Endgame'.<br />Overall, the Delta quadrant maps contained the most errors of the book, and i got the feeling Mandel really didn't know Voyager all that well, which was disappointing.<br />One thing the book lacks is a decent index, which is vital in order to find certain planets, and could save hours of map searching for planets that aren't there.<br />Overall, this is a brillaint book, but is incomplete. If Mandel gets to do a second edition, I hope that he can expand the maps, include more worlds, moretrade routes, more starship routes and fix up a lot of his errors, not to mention put in an index.<br />If you're a trek fan, casual or serious, you should have this book. Despite it's flaws, it's pretty well done, and obviously shows Mandel is one of Trek's new heavywieghts.	2003-03-28

First is the Defiant's mission into the Gamma Quadrant, a strictly exploratory mission sanctioned by Odo himself. The second plot line revolves around Bajor joining the Federation, and it's obvious that something very big is beginning there.<br />The book proceeds at a slow but steady pace, rich in descriptive detail and the finer points of trek lore, yet both are inserted so subtlely into the plot that the reader simply accepts these extra details as part of the literary experience.<br />While the book doesn't resolve all the issues presented in it by the end, it does show the respective parties making progress with these issues, such as the Vaughn/Prynn relationship or Quark/Ro relationship. Neither reach an obvious conclusion by the end of the book, but it is obvious that progress has been made, and ultimately the reader is left satisfied and eager to read the next volume.<br />My one critcism of the book is that it is a touch slow in parts, especially some of the parts that involve Kasidy on Bajor, or Vaughn/Akaar's dinner, which is why I gave this book 4 stars and not 5. I'm all one for rich detail, but these scenes dragged on a little too much for my liking.<br />One much smaller criticism of the book is on a technical level, regarding a character from the series, Admiral Ross. Ross was Sisko's immediate superior and one of the key decision makers during the Dominion War, and although it was never confirmed, many people saythat he was the Bajoran Sector Commander. Either way, Ross was an important official, and to not have him somehow involved with Bajor's joining the Federation simply doesn't sit right with me.<br />But overall, the book is a great story, and is well worth purchasing.	2003-03-18

The concepts are scattered and are introduced using complicated mathematics, some of which is beyond 1st year level. Even simply trying to read through the verbal explanations is near impossible for beginner students, simply because of the depth of knowledge required to do so.<br />The problems, while plentiful, are simply too difficult. Original thinking is one thing, these problems require something else entirely. I realise, of course, that textbooks must be challenging in order to maintain academic standards, but this book goes too far, to the point where students end up discouraged from the subject simply because the concepts are so difficult. <br />While I maintain the greatest respect for Mr Beer, as I am sure that he is a brilliant engineer (his book is testament to that), the text is simply too in-depth. For future editions, I recommend that he go through the book and greatly simplify both the language and the problems.<br />Until this book is simplified, I recommend the Hibbler Dyanmucs text to any other students out there.	2003-03-18

My suggestions for future editions would be to tone down the language to a more basic level, and to include more diagrams to aid the student in conceptualisation.	2003-03-18
US	49538119	R266P47CL6M41Y	0743437918	240188268	The Hologram's Handbook (Star Trek: Voyager)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Witty	A brilliant and witty piece of Star Trek writing, possibly the wittiest piece of Star Trek writing I've ever read.<br />Robert Picardo catches the essence of Voyager's EMH, our beloved Doctor, in a way that only he could. Witty, insightful and thought provoking are all words that perfectly describe this book.<br />I couldn't put it down, Picardo's writing is so smooth it's like listening to the Doctor himself talking. And not only does he provide insightful views on his character, but also some views about life in general, which are recurrent themes throughout all the centuries portrayed on Star Trek.<br />And, unlike the show, this book gives equal credit to pre-Scorpion and post-Scorpion time periods, and the Doctor speaks of both Kes and Seven of Nine fondly.<br />However, the book wasn't perfect. While Picardo covers the Doctor's views on some of the major characters nicely, I felt that he failed to provide enough insight into his relationships with the other characters on Voyager, particularly Neelix and Harry Kim.<br />Another low point of the book me was his continued references to Lt. Joe Carey, a recurring guest star on Voyager. In one early episode, Carey was abrasive to the Doctor, and Picardo has played that out to the extreme here, often saying he didn't like Carey. I found that to be a little rough, Carey eventually died on an away mission for Voyager, and to speak ill of a dead crewmember like that doesn't cut it in my book.<br />I would also have liked to have read more about the Doctor's experiences in the Delta Quadrant, and not just about personal relationships. The Doctor remained active and onboard the ship during most of the alien takeovers, and more often than not entire episodes were devoted to his adventures. Wouldn't these sorts of experiences have shaped his views on life a little? He watched as Suder struggled to contain his violence, watched as the Hirogen tortured the bodies of Voyager crewmembers, and countless other such experiences.Wouldn't these sort have things changed him? Perhaps he held a grudge against the Hirogen? Or detested the way the Vidiians used their medical science to harm others? Little to no attention was paid to these in the book, and I didn't like that. Those sort of experiences deserved a chapter at least, but Picardo paid no attention to them.<br />But that being said, the book was excellent, and provided great insight into the Doctor's character.<br />A must read if you are a Voyager fan.	2003-01-26
US	49538119	R1LVHTGRN4D2H8	0671021265	519262866	Preserver (Star Trek)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good, not fantastic	My title for this review pretty much sums up my thoughts on the book, it was good, but not fantastic.<BR>It continues the story from 'Dark Victory' nicely, tying up the story of Tiberius nicely.<BR>It also shows Kirk in yet another battle with a mortal foe, and, again, having personel problems. <BR>Again, the book were technically astute, probably the most technically correct Star Trek books I've ever read. <BR>But the writing in itself poses a problem. After reading the numerous and excellent Judith and Garfield Reeves Stevens novels, I wonder how much of the books Shatner himself actually writes. It's obvious they do a great deal of the more detailed work, more than the book gives them credit for really.<BR>The story, while a great continuation of 'Dark Victory', seemed to go too far in violating the Trek legend. The authors seem to say that the incidents that put our heroes in the places they are today (First Contact, Kirk taking command of the Enterprise, Janeway commanding Voyager) were all influenced by this magical Preserver race, which is actually the First Federation encountered by Kirk in 2264.<BR>I always grew up thinking that the characters in Star Trek had EARNED their positions, and that Starfleet was the sort of organisation that recognised people of their abilities and put them in positions that bested sutied them to utilise those abilities to the full. To no suddenly be told the Preservers did all of it is simply folly, and I cannot believe it.<BR>Again, Starfleet is portrayed as being some sort of bumbling beauracracy, with inept admirals and competent but overworked field officers. I refuse to accept that.<BR>But in total, I began to feel sorry for Kirk. He has been through so much, done so much, and now hast lost it all again. I began to think that I preferred the 'canon' Kirk story, that is, he died on the mountain top on Veridian III, forever among the stars he first saw as a farmboy in Iowa.<BR>The book has some good points and bad, but is sofar from Trek 'canon' that it cannot even be considered for 'canon' designation. <BR>But it is still a great story, and if you've read the entire rebirth series so far, you would be well advised to finish it.	2003-01-26
US	49538119	RAHPXGH30WHX3	0345428811	938075605	Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Good movie, not so good novel	I won't spend much time talking about Episode II itself, everyone knows it was absolutely fantastic and one of the best SW movies. But one earlier reviewer did say these movies didn't have the same mystery as the others. I agree, there isn't as much mystery, but if Lucas had released the movies from I to IV, the mystery is IV,V and VI wouldn't be there, so it's sort of a catch 22. There are some mysterious remaining, like how exactly Leia's force abilities were hidden, the fate of the some of characters(Mace Windu for example), and the exact circumstances that led to the remaining Jedi going into hiding.<br />I found the book itself a riveting read at the beginning, it explored Padme and her family a great deal, and probed deeper into her psyche than epII could, like why she entered politics. The Lars family was explored in great detail as well, including Shmi's abduction, it was all very well done.<br />However, later in the book is where Salvatore came apart a bit. I found his writing somewhat flawed, for action scenes where detail was vital, he would detail some small parts very well, then barely touch others, he sort of wrote in 'spurts' of detail if you will, which I found made the book frustrating to read. This happened a great deal later in the book, almost as if Salvatore was in a hurry to get it finished. Personally, after reading his woeful New Jedi Order work, I was very skeptical to buy EpII, but my love of Star Wars demanded it.<br />I would have also liked some more detail into the Senate affairs back on Coruscant, Bail Organa will be an important character in the future, and we learnt virtually nothing about him in this book.<br />Overall, not a bad read, but it's more for diehard fans. If you're a casual fan, just see the movie a few times.	2002-07-09
US	49538119	R1PZ7WTXB74T7S	074343434X	486466475	The Battle of Betazed (Star Trek: the Next Generation)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Good stuff	The Battle for Betazed can pretty much be summed up in it's title, it is about how the Feds reclaimed Betazed during the Dominion war, in a covert operation that involved the TNG crew.<BR>The plot flows along rather nicely, the authors know their stuff pretty well, except for a few continuity points which I will outline later.<BR>The central character is, of course, Deanna Troi, and the book is highly descriptive of her feelings over the conquering of her homeworld, played out mainly in conversations with Riker and Picard.<BR>The other major story is that of the actual people on Betazed, the members of the resistance and the occupying forces are both portrayed very well. Typically, Lwaxana is in the middle of everything, and the writers do her good as well.<BR>The crux of the book deals with the age old question, of death or shame? Do a species defy their principles in order to survive? In this book, the Betazoids want to enlist the services of a Betazoid criminal who can kill with his mind, however only he knows of it, so Starfleet needs to bring him in. This is where Troi and the covert team come in, with a bit of help from the Enterprise and the Defiant(including Worf and O'Brien).<BR>The plot resolution is fairly neat, it invents a solution from the circumstances, but I won't reveal it here.<BR>Now I don't like to be a nitpicker, but there were some serious problems in this book. The first of which was the setting, the authors said it was set in mid 2375, after Dax's death but before Insurrection. However, as we know from DS9, at this point the Federation was winning the war, and had gone on the offensive(by taking Chin'toka). I find it hard to believe Starfleet would try to invade Dominion territory while one of the core Federation worlds was still under occupation. I was under the impression the Romulans took back Betazed when they first entered the war, but that's just my impression.<BR>There was a slight technical fault, the writers used something called a 'scramble field', this doesn't exist. But, if these inconsistencies are overlooked, BFB is a solid book and well worth the read for TNG and DS9 fans.	2002-07-09

Up to the Thraw duology, the expanded Star Wars universe had been slowing down somewhat, the defeat of the Empire and subsequent establishment of the New Republic allowing the galaxy to be 'reborn' as such, and we even started seeing some old grudges come back.<BR>Pre-NJO books were usually trilogy series, long and rich in detail, and most of the time adding something substantial to the plot. Yes, there was a 'superweapon of the week' syndrome for a while, but that died down with Zahn's last work.<BR>With the start of NJO in Vector Prime, we saw a very much darker image of the galaxy, written in a basic, rudimentary fashion designed to give the reader some elementary facts about the plot, but precious else. Many of the major characters were simply forgotten about in VP, and the death of Chewie sent NJO prematurely to the grave<BR>The Vong themselves were somewhat interesting, a culture built strictly on biology, but I found them very far fetched. Their entry into the galaxy almost seemed to be unopposed, their advance unstoppable into the heart of the SW universe fans have learned to know and love.<BR>The level of violence in these books is also disturbing, many of the battle scenes are graphic and go to great efforts to describe the bloody scenes, I thought there was a real thing against anything but the slightest trace of blood in SW?<BR>This latest book is woeful, not only have the New Republic been invaded, but Coruscant, heart of the galaxy, has fallen to the 'Vong'. This is ridiculous.<BR>The major characters are now forming a 'New Alliance' against the New Republic, going against their superiors in order to fight the Vong, the whole concept of which betrays the principles so many brave young men and women died for in the Galactic Civil War.<BR>In short, these novels are perpendicular to the principles George Lucas established in his movies, the only reason I gave this one 2 stars was because the writing was somewhat decent.<BR>Don't buy these books.	2002-04-30
US	49538119	R1RO6DTV4WVJ14	044023722X	299088859	A Painted House	Books	4	0	1	N	N	One of Grisham's best	If you like Grisham novels or just a darn good story, this is a book for you. <br />The book is completely different to Grisham's other legal novels, there isn't a single lawyer in the story. The story revolves around a rural family in post WWII USA, a fascinating time period.<br />The central character is that of Luke, a supposably 7 year old boy living on the farm with his parents and grandparents. They grow cotton on the farm to support themselves, and the book is set just before the cotton is about to be harvested. <BR>The story basically involves Luke learning more about life through the harvest and meeting the hired farmhands, and through this, he gradually learns more and more things he has to keep secret.<br />At first, I doubted whether or not the novel was any good, some of Grisham's more recent works haven't been terrific, but this book pulls you in for two reasons, it's a first person novel, and you want to learn more about the world Luke lives in.<br />I found the characters excellent, my personal favourite was Luke's 'Pappy'(grandfather), the tough old man of the farm, but eveyone else is pretty good. The flaw in the characters comes from Luke, who is supposably only 7 years old, yet his thought processes and general knowledge are that of a teenager. I think either one of two things has occured here, either Grisham is trying to show the kid is VERY intelligent, or his characterisation is a bit off, I am inclined towards the latter.<BR> <BR>The major downside to the book though is the ending, which doesn't resolve some of the biggest issues in the book, such as whether or not Luke's uncle comes back from Korea, or what exactly happens to the Latcher family.<br />Grisham has been doing this a lot in his books lately, 'The Street Lawyer' was the worst case of it, but this book is no exception. Unless he starts finishng his books properly, Grisham is going to lose readers, which would be a terrible shame.<br />Overall though, this is an excellent book, a must for any Grisham fan, simply because it is an great story, and the first of Grisham's novels without a laywer in sight, which will probably be a future trend. I also feel this book will probably be made into a movie sometime soon, I think it would work well on the big screen.	2002-01-31
US	49538119	R6IJW8AH0YMYB	0345420438	352579083	The Tailor of Panama	Books	3	3	7	N	N	Okay.	The Tailor of Panama(TOP) in my opinion, is an okay book, but nothing spectacular. I found the plot fairly intruiging, but the best part about it were the characters, some of them were done really well.<BR>It's a pretty dark satire about the post cold war spy world, and basically involves spies and bad guys trying to get as much as they can out of the American handover of the Panama canal on 31/12/99. I found it too dark myself, the way the innocent were punished and the bad guys won, that's bad stuff.<BR>This book is, like most LeCarre books, definitely not easy reading. LeCarre jumps from present to past scene so quickly, and trying to distinguish between Pendel's lies and the truth is difficult. You also need a pretty good general knowledge about the spy world to read this, a lot of spy slang terms are given without explanation, which can get confusing.<BR>I didn't understand the end, I think the person in that scene walked to their death, but I don't know, it's so confusing.<BR>In short, read this is you like LeCarre and a reading challenge, but if you like easy reading, don't touch this book.	2002-01-20

The wave wipes out over thirty million people on the first few planets it wipes out, and Starfleet, Picard in particular, just seem to accept that without any sort of grief or sorrow, while the loss of 10 Enterprise crewmembers is a tremendous tragedy, as if death from genocide is some sort of galactic constant and no more needs to be said on it, completely ridiculous.<br />I also don't like the format Vornhole has written the book in (or the format the publishers chose, I don't know which). The font change is okay, but at the beginning of each chapter the format is changed, I prefer the old format with the Starfleet symbol.<BR>      I also don't like the technical side of the genesis wave, how can a wave be generated from a simple device have enough power to wipe out and recreate an entire planet? But the biggest problem is the travel factor, the wave starts at the edge of the Federation and moves in, and within a week or so is threatening Earth. That's ridiculous, there would have to be a couple of thousand light years distance there, and waves can't travel faster than the speed of light(physics IS constant).<BR>Like I said before, the book isn't a bad read, but it isn't an exceptionally good read either, think twice before buying it.	2002-01-02

The book provides a great deal of the backstory behind episode I, and in my opinion, should have been released a couple of months after the movie. <BR>The writing is solid, the dialouge worked in really well with the known characters. The characterisations were fairly good, but I found Captain Cohl to be a little bit two dimensional, he followed a pretty straight bad guy who eventually turns good path.<BR>The book is mostly politics, I enjoy that sort of thing, and some of the Senate characters hardly seen in episode I have big parts here, Valorum in particular. Palpatine was also done very well, the more I read, the more he conformed to the character I had imagined him to be. I think most of all, I liked the details given about the pre-Empire galaxy in general.<BR>James Luceno has done well here, better than those awful New Jedi Order 'books', it's painfully obvious in this novel that he has used the NJO map, but I guess no book can be perfect.<BR>Overall, an excellent book, if you found episode I unsatisfying or you're simply a Star Wars fan, buy this book.	2001-12-15

Star by Star is an interesting book, definitely one of the better books of the NJO series, which continues to violate the Star Wars plot.<BR>The book is well written, Denning is a good author, and the plot is well constructed. The characterisations are excellent, some light is shone on some characters we rarely see or hear, and the normal characters(the remaining ones) are also done well.<BR>However, I can't get over this whole NJO series, it's been nothing but death and destruction. I mean, haven't these characters suffered enough over the past two decades in the SW timeline? Particularly the Solo family, and in this book it just gets worse, with the loss of another major character and the loss of a major planet. <BR>If you like the NJO series, buy this book, it's fairly pivotal and gives a good indication of how the story will end.<BR>On a more personal note, I now refuse to buy the NJO books, and rely on plot synopsis and skim reading in bookshops for the story. As far as I'm concerned, the whole NJO series has violated the Star Wars story, and I can't believe George Lucas would let this happen, it's ridiculous.	2001-12-11

This is definitely ne of the better Voyager books, and goes to show that you don't always need a six book series for a good story. Basically, the story involves some sort of rift in space which spans across parallel dimensions, and after a period of time, it beams the entire population of a certain planet into space, each time accessing a different dimension, weird stuff. Voyager comes across this vast pool of bodies in space and investigates, and along the way bumps into some parallel Voyagers, and some of the crew get misplaced throughout these dimensions.<BR>The story ends as most time travel/alternate dimension stories end, with the crew sacrificing themselves to preserve the timeline, and afterwards, nobody really knows what happened, sort of pointless in a way, bit like Year in Hell.<BR>The writing was solid, excellent characterisations, and nearly every major character played a role, even Kes. The novel was set in season 3, pre seven of nine Voyager, so the story wasn't centered around the Borg. I felt this story really captured the 'essence' of season 3, each season of the show has a distinct look and feel about it, this book was most definitely season 3.<BR>The novel also dealt with the alternate dimensions well, the left/right system was a good analogy, not as confusing as a more recent J&amp;G novel series, the authors made it fairly easy to understand. Another point of mention, what was the go with three authors? It's a rare event to see a novel with three authors, but the results are there is this one.<BR>A good read, reminiscent of the days when Voyager was relatively innocent, before the plot became too convoluted, maybe not worth buying, but definitely worth borrowing from a library of friend.	2001-11-07
US	49538119	RVUTY17BLDI5X	0671035827	992426487	Cloak and Dagger (Star Trek Voyager, No 19, Dark Matters Book One of Three)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Average	This book is definitely not Star trek writing at it's best, but I find that is typical of most of the Voyager books written. Don't get me wrong, I really like the Voyager series, but most of the books have been second rate.<BR>I won't reveal too much of the plot, but suffice to say it involves a mysterious wormhole phenomena and the Romulan Empire. I really like the idea of the dark matter, but it wasn't really used properly, the idea of so many wormholes opening near Voyager is ridiculous, and even more ridiculous is the idea that Telek R'mor was so successful at making them, in 2344 I might add.<BR>There are numerous errors, within the Romulan Empire, it has been established in a great many episodes that the Praetor has the real power, the Emperor is merely a figurehead, much like the Queen of England nowadays. The central character, the head of the Tal Shiar, is fairly hollow, the old story of a person who has struggled against the oppresive forces of society to a position of great power. She seemed more like some sort of rogue that the head of one of the most feared organisations in existence. If you want to see a real Romulan, look no further than Koval from 'Inter arma enim silent leges', although he was a traitor, he had so much more poise about him, something about him just said 'Romulan'.<BR>Another problem is the continuity of the plot. 'Vulcan's Heart' clearly established the Romulan figureheads in 2344, this book, set in the same era, is nearly perpendicular in it's characters. I'm not a nitpicker, but Christie Golden really should of picked that one up, 'Vulcan's Heart' was very popular.<BR>Other than that, I thought the actual story on Voyager itself was alright, a bit predictable at times, but nonetheless enjoyable.<BR>This isn't a great book, I doubt it will be a great series, only pick it up if you're desperate for some Star Trek Voyager.	2001-09-07
US	49538119	R3ROV08GQ5OFVJ	0671028138	908733123	Day Of Honor Omnibus	Books	2	4	9	N	N	Pathetic	The entire 'Day of Honour' series is absolutely pathetic, some of the worst Star trek writing I have ever seen. At first, they look promising, the whole idea seems solid and interesting, but when you actually get down to it, they are nothing more than hopelessly pathetic stories typical of pocket books more recent publishing efforts. TNG part of the story starts off with some ridiculous story about a planet experiencing political upheavals, and Worf is sent in with a SI officer to sort out the mess. Meanwhile, Worf asks Captain Picard to take Alexander on some sort of 'Day of Honour' holodeck program. The story on the planet is mildly enjoyable, but it follows a set formula and the ending can be guessed easily. Picard and Alexander's quest is nothing more than Diane Carey writing about what she knows, Earth naval traditions, and while slightly interesting, contributes very little to the plot. The DS9 story also seems promising, but the characters drag the initial dialouge about the Klingon war way too far. Their trip to the planet becomes a blood bath, so don't expect very much from this story. The Voyager story is slightly more interesting, Torres being the obvious focus of the story, which involves her surviving an ordeal in an enemy prison camp. An interesitng story, and probably the better of the series. TOS story is also pathetic, and is written in a very simple, very organised fashion, much the way a children's storybook is written. The characters are boring and it is obvious when you read the first chapter what is going to happen, very poor writing indeed. The Voyager novelisation doesn't really deserve too much comment, it's a fairly simple novelisation of an interesitng episode, little more, like most Star Trek novelisations.  I hope Pocket books never tries to celebrate the day of honour again.	2001-07-22

At first, I thought these books were just some ridiculous marketing effort by pocket books with the whole y2k theme when these books were released, but thakfully they are not. Full credit to Judith and Garfield Reeves Stevens(J&amp;G from now on), for coming up with an excellent plot, not only for this book, but for books I &amp; III also.  The book directly continues from book I, jumping into a whole new situation for the Defiant, twenty five years in the future. I won't reveal too many details about the plot, but suffice to say the Federation is fighting a losing war against an evil Bajor, which is allied with the mysterious Grigari. Sisko and the crew are split up during their arrival to the new timeline, between Starfleet and Bajor. In this book, we see a very dark vision of the future for the galaxy, most of the major powers are gone, and the Dominion are out of the pciture. In one of the darkest notes of the book, Earth has been destroyed along with most of TNG crew, and thus Starfleet sold out on the Prime Directive. It seems to me, that J&amp;G, after their recent effort with Spectre, have become addicted to writing these sort of disaster stories, where Earth has been wiped out, and nothing Starfleet can do will help the good guys prevail. How much further can they violate the Star Trek story? A lot further. The new Bajoran relgion based upon the Pah wraiths, believes the two Bajoran wormholes will combine, and the ultimate reckoning will occur, as the year 2400 goes to 2401. When this happens, the resulting shockwave will not just destroy the Bajoran sector, the Alpha Quadrant or even the galaxy, but the whole UNIVERSE.  So, Starfleet is desperate to stop this from happening. J&amp;G use that magical Grigari(from 'Federation') race to explain why Starfleet is losing the war. Starfleet has betrayed the Prime Directive to stop the reckoning, and try anything togo back in time, and unfortunately the old slingshot routine won't cut it anymore. The now Fleet Admiral Picard(now 95 years old) has come up with a plan to build a huge starship which will go back in time through the Bajoran wormhole and plant bombs on Bajor, which will go off after the ship entered the wormhole.  The plot is incredibly complex, and full points to J&amp;G for the characterisations, everyone has a part, Garak, Quark, Nog, even O'Brien has more than his usual engineering talk. <br />Throughout the book, we learn more of what happened during the twenty five years past, and the story grows from bad to worse. It seems that Starfleet's efforts to stop the reckoning have all failed. I refuse to believe there was not SOME way they could go back in time, I mean, te Borg can do it easily (in First Contact'), and Starfleet now has an alliance with the Borg. Also, Voyager found a way to get into the Q continuum in 'The Q and the Grey' using supernovas, why not use that to contact Q?  However, once this is overlooked, the story is excellent. The ending is another thing however, and I won't reveal it in this review, suffice to say it leads on to book III, which goes on to solve the mysteries from book I. My advice, buy this book, as it's probably the best Star trek series in the last few years, and be prepared for a thrilling but extremely dark story.	2001-07-02

This story, the continuation of the tale started in Imzadi I, was not brilliant writing. The overall plot is alright, the whole story about Tom Riker was well done, but the biggest objection I have to the book was the relationship between Worf and Riker regarding Worf and Deanna, which eventually becomes one of distrust and almost hatred. Riker attempts not to be jealous of Worf and Deanna, but he cannot be, and part of the story revolves around his soul searching over the matter. The other part deals with Worf and Deanna, what Alexander thought of the relationship, and Worf finally meeting Lwaxana Troi, and their feelings towards each other. Although the major plot elements are resolved, the book ends on a rather dark note, as Worf criticises Riker, saying that Riker's comment about the phaser in First Contact was an insult rather than a joke. Is this the type of relationship between characters one wants to carry on? In the other series there have been characters who don't quite get along perfectly, McCoy and Spock, Odo and Quark, but these relationships never end up as hatred, any hatred they feel for each other is usually dealt with in an episode. It is a shame to see these two characters at each other like this, and I hope this is not reflective of any sort of trend in Star Trek in general. Not an extremely good book, but not an extremely bad one either.	2000-11-08

The latest Deep Space Nine book is certainly well worth reading, and i rate it as one of the best ST books ever written. The remarkable story of Elim Garak, plain, simple, Garak, who emerged as one of the most interesting characters in DS9 even though he wasn't part of the actual cast. It catches up on all the details of Garak's life, written as a letter back to Julian Bashir while Garak is on Cardassia after the end of the Dominion war. If you were intruiged by what Garak hinted at in 'The Wire', you will love this book, it goes into so much more detail. Not only is the plot well written, but the different characters are potrayed brilliantly, with snippets of Garak's sense of humour showing throughout the novel.       The novel utilises nearly all the Cardassian characters we have en over the years, Tain, Dukat, Madred, and creates new ones as well, and these new characters play vital roles in Garak's life.    I think the ending was particularly well done, including when Garak sees his old friend again, and the last paragraph leaving the reader with questions about whether or not he will find his love again.       The only criticism I have regarding this novel is the way in which Garak spoke about how the Romulans entered the Federation Alliance. In one scene, a flashback, he is talking to Bashir about it as if Bashir knew what had happened. I was under the impression that only Sisko and Garak knew about this, and that they never told anyone else, Sisko wouldn't even tell Dax. But, this minor error is more than made up for with the brilliant story, a terrific book for all DS9 fans.	2000-09-26

Suddenly Jack Ryan's career doesn't look so great anymore, not all his  enemies are foreigners. The crisis Ryan had was good, particularly in the  cryptic remarks he used towards the end about if it wasn't for him Elliot  and Fowler wouldn't be there, referring back to Clear and Present Danger,  it was great. It was also really good to see another submarine adventure,  where the crew aren't quite happy with their captain, and a Soviet  submarine captain looking to be the best captain ever. The book was really  good in the way it involved so many people and different section of the  armed forces towards the end, the battle in Berlin, the sub battle in the  Pacific, the carrier skirmish, truly great. And the scene at the end when  Fowler wanted to do something he shouldn't have, and good old Jack Ryan was  there to stop him, that was done brilliantly. It was also very interesting  reading about how the terrorists made the device, a great read. Now the  plot is a little far fetched, how the device fell into enemy hands, how the  one guy who survived at Denver knew about the TV van, how so many military  advisors were unavailable, but the scenario present at the end is terrific.  If you're looking for a good reads, this is it.	2000-08-17
US	49538119	RDZE9BS3UIPQO	0446606243	58879561	The Tenth Justice	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Okay.	Pretty good book, many people say this young boy could be the next John Grisham, they may be right. Te story was incredible, going into the world  of the Supreme Court and the clerks that work behind the scenes to make  things happen. Fascinating story, just that little slip of the tongue, and  Ben Addison's life changes irrevocably. The characters were real, the only  real objection I have is the way they treated each other. It ended up with  everyone yelling at each other, and Ben accusing everyone of being a  traitor. The actual mystery was goodm how the author made us keep guessing,  incredible. An original, good novel with believable characters.	2000-08-17

Well, this book was a worthy ending to the Millenium epic, it's good to  see some high quality books being published. It continues straight on from  book II, and the 'hell' as such is very well done. Since I haven't read the  first book, I came into the trilogy blind, which doesn't help when you're  trying to decipher through masses of chronobabble as another reviewer  called it. If you think you know about time travel, think you know exactly  what is happening in the time travel episodes, read this book for the  ultimate challenge. The writers, J&amp;G for simplicity, must have degrees  if not doctorates in physics for all this stuff. The book wraps up the  trilogy nicely, particularly with having the action in different locations.  All the characters were well done, particularly Jake, who has never had a  major role in the series. All the things about the red orbs, it's really  fascinating, and the little 'conspiracy' as such that surrounds them. If  you are looking for a good read, buy this book.	2000-07-19

Great detail into the  Romulan races, continuing the story of the Romulan Commander from the  'Enterprise Incident', and tying up a loose end from 'Yesterday'  Enterprise. I always found the Romulans more fascinating than the Klingons,  they were so devious, the Klingons are just brutes. The battle was good,  and having Picard on the Stargazer was a nive touch. It's sort of like an  intermediate point between TOS and TNG, 2344 to be precise. This book  actually shows the battle the Enterprise-C has with the Romulans at  Narendra III, it's brilliant. If you want a good book to read, buy this  book.	2000-07-09

This  is not the standard TNG book, the only character we know is Picard,  everyone else is fiction. The crew of the Stargazer were protrayed well, as  were the crew on the Valiant. The plot is good, but, like another reviewer,  the enemy troubled me slightly. They were not gone into in any detail, they  were simply the Nuyyad, we never even saw a member of the species, only a  slight physical description from one of the characters. Another thing is  the planet Magnia. It is located outside the Galactic Barrier, I thought  that was impossible? Wasn't there a great void between galaxies containing  absolutely nothing, how can there be a planet? But, there's very little  else to complain about. The story was solid, as were the characters. A good  read.	2000-07-09

The setting is brilliant, and the character of Pellaeon is portrayed  brilliantly. One of the best Star Wars books, if you keep up with SW, buy  it.	2000-05-16

The whole things about 'red' orbs and the second celestial temple is cool, but when I read through the other books I find that yet again, an alternate timeline story involving  the destruction of the Federation and most of the known galaxy, just like  Spectre. Personally, I am sick of this type of things, and I am sick of  these multi-book stories, which is all that I have been seeing lately. Does  anybody else feel like this? But, the story is really good, accurate,  detailed, thrilling. If you enjoy DS9, buy this book.	2000-05-13
