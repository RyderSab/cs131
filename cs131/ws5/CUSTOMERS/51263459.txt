The word ha'ole for example, has the root 'ha' meaning breath, and the word ole meaning without.  So the word used initially to describe missionaries that came to Hawaii, has the secondary meaning, those who pray without breath.<br /><br />Within this book is an explanation of the ha rite, which uses breath combined with prayer (intention) to generate mana which is sent to your higher self to manifest what you want in your life.  This is a very powerful technique.<br /><br />I have combined what I have gotten from this book and a few other sources, and using my intuition have come up with something very effective.<br /><br />The Huna commandment on page 72 is not to harm another.  So using this technique to interfere with someone's free will would not be appropriate.<br />If you do wish to focus on someone work for their highest good. If you wish to manifest love in your life, you can have a person in mind who seems ideal, but ask for this if they are agreeable on a higher self level or for someone equal or greater.<br /><br />In this book you will find described many concepts such as ho'oponopono, and the concept of the three selves, middle self (ego), lower self, (subconscious or hidden self), and the higher self (superconscious or superego). According to this system you would integrate all these aspects of self, and clear out the blocks or complexes within your lower self so you can manifest through your higher self.<br /><br />Further reading I recommend would be 'Mastering your hidden self' by Serge Sahili King, which also describes the Shamanic principles for creating your own reality.  These were life changing for me. I also highly recommend \\"Go up and work with God' by Vianna Stibal, a healer.  In that book she describes a manifesting ritual from her Huna studies.  An excellent book.<br /><br />Secret Science behind Miracles by Max Freedom Long is a must read book if you want to learn more from the pioneer who discovered what was until then a secret philosphy.a secret philosphy.	2005-10-13

For example, thoughts, feeling, actions = results. Rich people focus on opportunities, poor people focus on obstacles.<br /><br />As you read this book, you will discover many interesting insights into how to become wealthy. You will also discover the mindsets of rich people compared to poor people.  It is very illuminating to see the connection between how people think and how they do.<br /><br />For example, I have a friend who is quite spiritual, yet his attitude towards money is if I win the lottery, I would give most of it away, as I would feel guilty having all that money. What a limiting belief to have.<br /><br />If you're like me then reading through the contrasting mindsets of rich people and poor people will be most illuminating.  For exmaple when I read that 'poor people focus on problems, rich people focus on opportunities, I totally changed my mindset, it has become my mantra, and using it has enabled me to look beyond the problem which may or may not be real, and to go for the opportunity.<br /><br />I also highly recommend Think and grow rich by Napoleon Hill, which as far as I am concerned is the ultimate work on this subject.<br /><br />Hope you find this helpful.	2005-09-28

Is this possible?<br /><br />Can water read the word love from a glass, or understand when someone yells 'you fool' at it and react accordingly?  Science would suggest such a thing is preposterous, and most people would probably agree.<br /><br />Yet, if you consider there is no such thing as reality, only perception then there is room in the world for Emoto's contention that water is transformed for the better by the energy of our good intentions, or our good emotions.<br /><br />This book is packed with interesting anecdotes, the most interesting to me was to imagine the monk chanting at the edge of the lake, and seeing the lake transform, and become clearer.<br /><br />The implications of this are far reaching and profound. Imagine the possible explanations.  That knowledge brings with it certain responsibility.<br /><br />If you are like me, you will find this book very thought provoking, you might even have some life altering insights if you read with an open mind. At the very least its an interesting read, and a perfect addition to your coffee table.	2005-09-20

Books	5	23	27	N	Y	Amazing	I am mystified by some of the mixed reviews here.  I must admit I had some scepticism of Mr Robbins based on his infomercials, mainly because he tells what his material can do, but not how it works.  In this book though he delivers the goods.<br /><br />This book contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. I am still working through this book, yet already I have successfully used some of the concepts.<br /><br />For example, there is a chapter about asking yourself the right questions, which can instantly change you into a more positive and empowering state, rather than feel victimized as people often do by adversity.<br /><br />I used the transformative language technique to resolve a situation where I was angered by the behavior of an associate.  Through using the word disenchanted instead of angry to describe how I felt, I immediately lessened the emotional intensity of the situation, and was ultimately able to resolve the situation peacefully.<br /><br />This book also contains practical and powerful NLP techniques, such as repatterning and swish technique.  While it may be true to say that some of Robbins work is derivative of the works of Erickson, Bandler and Grinder  I have rarely seen the material presented in such a user friendly way.  There truly is magic in these concepts.<br /><br />If you can imagine leading a better and more effective life the concepts in this book will show you the way.<br /><br />What I particularly appreciate about this book is how well written it is.  It has a really flowing easy to read style. I highly recommend this book, and I have a great deal of respect for the writer after reading it.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.	2005-09-16

There is also an energy practice which uses the power of focus.<br /><br />This book goes through the 7 rules of the Huna Philosophy, explaining them in some detail. It is an ancient belief system, and also an amazing self improvement system which I wholeheartedly recommend.<br /><br />The world is what you think it is i.e there is no reality only perception.  There are no limits.  Energy flows where attention goes are three of the rules.<br /><br />There are many self help books out there which focus on individual concepts, which seem new, yet are all contained within this philosophy, which is over 2,000 years old. I am thinking of books such as the Power of Intention, and the Power of Now, Unlimited power.<br /><br />In addition the concepts of the conscious, subconscious, and superconscious or universal mind, have been around for thousands of years, yet only since the early 1900s with the writings of those such as Carl Jung have these ideas become more widely accepted.<br /><br />This philosophy does enable you to combine your three selves, and clear emotional blocks and limiting beliefs for improved effectiveness.<br /><br />There are excellent healing practices and visualizations within this book.  Many of our illnesses spring from our unresolved emotions, whereas much of western medicine treats the symptom not the cause.  I believe energy practice is very important for focus, as energy flows where attention goes.<br /><br />Many other philosophies share common roots with this one.  One of the main differences is this a can do not a can't do philosophy.  To use one of the beliefs, there are no limits.  If you buy this book your journey is only beginning because you will want to learn more.<br /><br />I hope you f.ind this review helpful.br />I hope you f.ind this review helpful.	2005-09-09

If you spent decades modeling the EEG patterns of yogis, swamis, and healers, you might find common patterns for people engaged in creating, problem solving, learning, healing, memorizing and meditating.<br /><br />If you were to use entrainment to create sound pulses and music to recreate those exact same EEG patterns in normal individuals, a feeling of lucid awareness, you would create something wonderful.<br /><br />Dr Jeffrey Thompson has done this. For the price of an ordinary CD you can get the pioneering benefit of all this amazing technology.<br /><br />According to the sleeve notes with the CD there are fifteen different layers of brainwave entrainment sounds used to create the awakened mind pattern.<br /><br />This CD is very mentally stimulating, creating all sorts of mental imagery and very relaxing.<br /><br />This type of CD also uses subaudible binaural beats in the soundtrack. How this works is that if a frequency of say 100 Hz goes in your left ear, and 105 Hz goes in your right ear, then both sides of your brain reconcile this by creating a third 5 Hz brainwave, which would be in the Theta range associated with creativity and a trance state. This also creates new neural pathways in the brain enabling you to access this desired state more easily in the future, and also induces synchronicity between both sides of your brain. With fifteen different levels of entrainment on this CD, you can imagine how beneficial this could be.<br /><br />So, I recommend you get the CD first.  In one session you can immediately reattune to the awakened mind pattern.  With practice you can reach this state automatically.<br /><br />Then if you find that helpful, go ahead and buy this book which has many insights on this interesting subject, and some interesting meditation techniques to use with the pattern.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.you can reach this state automatically.

In reality, we all access this state of consciousness frequently, for example, at a scary movie if you find yourself squirming in your seat while watching the movie you are probably in this state.<br /><br />As you read this book, you realise that hypnosis really is the ability to use the power of your imagination, while minimising the interference of your conscious mind, to effect permanent and positive benefits in your mind and body, and to break free of those behaviors that do not serve you.<br /><br />You are learning the skill of communicating with yourself on a deeper level.<br /><br />This book is organised in a very easy to use manner.  There are scripts for 35 different situations ranging from stress to procrastination, better sex, smoking, problem solving etc.<br /><br />For example, if you were to use the rapid healing script, you read the induction which involves you going down in an elevator, and gradually feeling more and more relaxed till you get to the bottom, then if you wish you may use the deepening script to get into an even deeper state.  Then you read out loud the script itself.  I noticed that a cut I had, started healing much faster after I read this script. Then, as you practice it more and more, it gets easier to do and you can really feel the effects.<br /><br />When I read the induction out loud, it worked very well.  Then as I used the deepening script I went into the deepest state I believe I have ever consciously experienced.  Amazing.  There really is amazing power to this technique.<br /><br />Naturally, you do need to practice this for a while before the changes become permanent. Can  you imagine how great you would feel if you were to finally have mastery over your behavior and your emotions?<br /><br />He also explains why affirmations often do not work. Affirmations can work well if they are done properly.  If you do use them in conjuntion with the techniques in this book, then obviously they would be even more effective.<br /><br />I also highly recommend EFT, Emotional Freedom Technique. Imagine letting go of issues such as stress, anger, sadness, anxiety, sadness, phobias, unforgiveness, by doing a simple acupressure technique which you can do in less than two minutes.

You hesitate for a moment, and then accept.  Then you are asked for a donation to their cause.  You want to leave, you don't want to pay, you don't believe in the cause.  Yet, what you do?  You make a donation and leave.  You have just been trapped in the normal human compulsion to reciprocate one kindness with another.<br /><br />When you have to criticise someone, say at work, how often do you say something like 'I think you're great but this is not good enough' This actually causes the person to lose respect for you, because the compliment followed by the word but, is an obvious manipulation and not sincere or believable, but designed to make the other person accept your criticism.<br /><br />However, if you do not the use the word but at all, and start with the negative and then say... and yet you have all these great qualities such as....the person will actually be more likely to accept the criticism and like you, and respect you.<br /><br />This book is packed with brilliant examples.<br /><br />How saying something slightly negative or self effacing about yourself can make you more likable.<br /><br />Did you know that using the word because in a certain way can get a perfect stranger to do you a favor.<br /><br />There is one interesting story on crowd behavior, and if you read this story, you will learn information that could save yours or someone else's life.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to friends.

If you are like me, and not a specialist, you may find the audio a quicker and more effective way to put the therapy to use.<br /><br />Each time, after I listen the world seems a little brighter, my memories are brighter and my outlook is brighter because I have tackled a limiting behavior or belief.<br /><br />Have you ever you noticed that people seem to behave the same way over and over with a similar negative outcome because they have not known how to overcome patterned behavior.<br /><br />There are situations such as guilt, public speaking, phobias, shyness, unhappiness, anxiety, obsession, self esteem. Perhaps you have a problem getting past a certain situation or trauma.<br /><br />With this therapy you have the tools to address these issues, by going back beyond the first time you experienced this behavior. Can you imagine going back in time and changing the way you felt before you were in that situation and to replace those feelings with more positive emotions. Then, as you go forward in time back to the present, you see all those other similar situations and all these are replaced up to the present time and going on into the future where you visualize yourself acting in a better way.<br /><br />You also visualize your life as a (time) line, with a color. As you make these changes you imagine your line filling with color. You can see dark patches, bad memories being removed.<br /><br />Because you have taken this action your world has changed for the better.

Since taking this training originally,  I have undergone the full training and Timeline Therapy training with the Tad James Company.

I read portions of that book, and the stories I read were excellent.<br /><br />More recently I was listening to a conference call with Kenrick Cleveland, an NLP sales pioneer.  During this call they mentioned Therapeutic Metaphors by David A. Gordon, and how good this book was, a must read. Then they said something that made me decide to buy this book.<br /><br />When you tell a story, the listener identifies with the lead character in the story, in essence believing the character is them.  Can you imagine how powerful a story you can tell, knowing the listener is identifying with the main character, and how this can be applied either to sales or relationships.<br /><br />I remember telling a female friend a story about how a friend of mine made a judgmental comment about woman who was overweight. She said she felt terrible because if that's what happens to this woman, then what does that say about peoples perception of her.  I said this story is not about you, and jokingly said why does everything have to be about you?  She laughed and agreed.  Another example is fairy tales where girls identify with the princess, and boys identify with the Prince.<br /><br />So, when I heard this conference call this was an ah ha moment for me.  There is much instruction in this book about how to construct healing metaphors, and some examples.<br /><br />I read one story in this book, and it had such visual impact that as I read it I felt I was there as this story was unfolding. That is how strong the imagery is.  I do strongly recommend this book for any aspiring writer or storyteller.  After all, good storytelling is all about getting and sustaining the listener or reader's attention, and giving them a memorable experience, while getting your message across.<br /><br />My first foray into this field was the Erickson story book, My voice will go with you, which I highly recommend.  If you have an interest in this field this book is a must, because these are case studies from the master himself.<br /><br />The Gordon book breaks down the technique in more detail, teaching you how to use metaphor powerfully.<br /><br />Hope this was useful.e these are case studies from the master himself.

I believe people who are blocked from drawing well will get the most from this book. More accomplished artists may benefit as well by understanding better how the process works.<br /><br />It shows you how to look at things differently, and gives you techniques to enable you to bypass your left (logical) brain, and access your right brain, (your subconscious mind), hence the title.<br /><br />Instead of using left brain- right brain theory to describe this,  in my view the more correct description would be to learn to access your subconscious mind which functions at a deeper level, while reducing the way in which your conscious mind interferes with the creative process.<br /><br />Your brain has four levels of consciousness, beta which is normal waking state, alpha which is a relaxed meditative state such as when you are about to go to sleep, theta which is a deeper state associated with creativity and light sleep, and delta which is deep sleep.<br /><br />Normally, your brain shows shows some activity at all these levels.  Artists and other creative people are able to access the creative mental state more easily.<br /><br />Here is an example of how the process works.<br /><br />If you try to draw a chair you may have a definite idea in your logical mind of how a chair should be, so when you draw you are thinking 4 legs, a seat and a back. You know all the legs are the same length, and therefore you may draw that way.<br /><br />This can interfere with you doing a good drawing, because each leg from an artistic viewpoint is longer or shorter depending on the distance from your eye, so you have to learn how to use your vision to see it differently.<br /><br />In the book is a picture of something such as a chair or a person's face, and you may draw it as it is. You can also use a picture from a newspaper or magazine. This shows your current skill level.<br /><br />Now, turn the picture upside down and draw the picture upside down. As you do this drawing, you may notice that you are producing a more accurate copy of the picture. See for yourself. I was amazed at the results.<br /><br />There are other examples and illustrations to show you how to see pictures differently, and use space, light and shade, optical illusions and so forth.<br /><br />As you become more experienced you will learn how to use your new skills automatically. I particularly enjoyed using pictures of movie stars, turning them upside down, copying them, and then doing it again right side up.<br /><br />I have referred several people who would love to draw well to this book. If you are not as artistic as you would like to be, and were to follow the exercises in this book there is no reason your skill level should not improve dramatically. If it worked for me, it can work for you. This is pretty easy.<br /><br />Most people have the skill, they just have not learned how to release it yet. This book will teach you how. Can you imagine drawing anything you want to draw completely accurately, and with incredible detail, subtlety and nuance. This potential is just a few clicks away. If it worked for me, it can work for you, because my drawing skills were not good.<br /><br />If you have further interest in developing your creative potential, I suggest you consider buying some entrainment CD's such as Awakened Mind System by Jeffrey Thompson, and Chakra Suite by Steven Halpern.

More accomplished artists may benefit as well by understanding better how the process works.<br /><br />It shows you how to look at things differently, and  uses different techniques to enable you to bypass your left  (logical) brain, and access your right brain, (your subconscious mind), hence the title.<br /><br />Instead of using left brain- right brain theory to describe this, in my view the more correct description would be to learn to access your subconscious mind which functions at a deeper level, while reducing the way in which your conscious mind interferes with the creative process.<br /><br />Your brain has four levels of consciousness, beta which is normal waking state, alpha which is a relaxed meditative state such as when you are about to go to sleep, theta which is a deeper state associated with creativity and light sleep, and delta which is deep sleep.<br /><br />Normally, your brain shows shows some activity at all these levels. Artists and other creative people are able to access the creative mental state more easily.<br /><br />Here is an example of how the process works.<br /><br />If you try to draw a chair you may have a definite idea in your logical mind of how a chair should be, so when you draw you are thinking 4 legs, a seat and a back. You know all the legs are the same length, and therefore you may draw that way.<br /><br />This can interfere with you doing a good drawing, because each leg from an artistic viewpoint is longer or shorter depending on the distance from your eye, so you have to learn how to use your vision to see it differently.<br /><br />This can interfere with you doing a good drawing, because each leg from an artistic viewpoint is longer or shorter depending on the distance from your eye, so you have to learn how to use your imagination instead.<br /><br />In this book there is a picture of something such as a chair or a person's face, and you may draw it as it is.  You can also use a picture from a newspaper or magazine. This represents your current skill level.<br /><br />Now, turn the picture upside down and draw the picture upside down.  As you do this drawing, you may notice that you are producing a more accurate copy of the picture. This is because you are now using different skills. I was amazed at the results. This is so simple to do.  Try it yourself and discover how easy it is.<br /><br />There are other examples and illustrations to show you how to see pictures differently, and use space, light and shade, optical illusions and so forth.<br /><br />As you become more experienced you will learn how to use your new skills automatically.  I particularly enjoyed using pictures of movie stars, turning them upside down, copying them, and then doing it again right side up.<br /><br />I have referred several people who would love to draw well to this book. If you are not as artistic as you would like to be, and were to follow the exercises in this book there is no reason your skill level should not improve dramatically. Naturally, the more you practice, the more you improve.  If it worked for me, it can work for you. This is pretty easy.<br /><br />Imagine drawing anything you want to draw completely accurately, and with incredible detail, subtlety and nuance just like a professional artist.  This potential is just a few clicks away.  If it worked for me, it can work for you, as my natural drawing was ability not good.h as a chair or a person's face, and you may draw it as it is.

I have bought many different energy based books, and used different energy based therapies and exercises with great results.<br /><br />This book caught my attention because very positive statements were made about it comparing it favorably with reiki and qigong etc.<br /><br />It is well written, concise and very easy to follow.  The exercises are easy to do. If you were to do the visualization, and various simple breathing patterns, you could start moving energy within minutes, and as you practice more and more then your skills will improve dramatically.<br /><br />With the QT exercises I can feel strong sensations throughout my body particularly in my hands and feet, and I am not an expert in this field.<br /><br />QT enables you to generate healing energy through your hands to work on yourself and others.<br /><br />There is a scientific principle called entrainment. If two items are vibrating side by side at different speeds then the item that vibrates at the lower speed will adjust to vibrate at the same frequency as the other object.<br /><br />Examples of this are swings in a playground that are swinging out of sync and adjust. Also, in a clock store you may notice the pendulum clocks of the same size swinging back and forth in unison.<br /><br />This principle applied to QT is that when you apply the higher healing vibration to an area of pain or disease (low vibration) it causes that area to reattune itself to the higher vibration, and thereby cure it.<br /><br />This method I find easier than Qigong for example. I am delighted with the results I am getting. This is the best book of this type I have read so far.<br /><br />I also highly recommend EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) which is a simple acupressure technique which can be done in less than two minutes. Can you imagine easily letting go of emotional issues such as anger, anxiety, fear, forgiveness, sadness, stress, phobias, procrastination, trauma etc. You can research this further and download a free manual at [...], and buy various EFT books at Amazon.

This one is by far the best value of all the fake books I checked at the store.<br /><br />The more you go through this book each time, the more you find yet another delightful piece. It is much more fun and easier to play naturally and improvise rather than sight reading the more difficult piano pieces with two staffs and big chords.<br /><br />Also, it written for C instruments which is important to remember for piano or guitar players. I mistakenly bought an Eb fake book and that was less natural to play and almost impossible to sing to, and I had to exchange it.<br /><br />Most times the songs are in the original keys, which is good.  Most jazz musicians I know use fake books.  Important to note is that all the lyrics seem to be included, because some fake books do not include them all.<br /><br />It shows guitar and piano chords but not symbols for either one, so if you are not used to playing extended jazzy chords you might find some songs tough going at first and may have to invest in a separate chord book.<br /><br />The chord changes are beautiful and authentic, and true to the original.  I was particularly impressed with the level of detail including note for note transcriptions of classic solos such as In My Life, so you can naturally reproduce the original sound.  Some songs include harmony notes which is great for ensemble work.<br /><br />As for those who say people under forty may not recognise many tunes, these are classics in the rock and standards category.  If you really want 80s and 90s music I am sure there are other books for you, but open yourself up to these pieces, and you will enjoy.<br /><br />This book includes releases by Beatles, George Harrison (his 4 best songs) Queen, James Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Various Motown, Soul, Jazz, Burt Bacharach, Samba, Dave Brubeck, Elton John, Neil Diamond, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Diana Ross, Buddy Holly, Aretha Franklin, Carole King, Bread, Beach Boys etc.  There is something here to please every taste.<br /><br />Some of the songs include Bohemian Rhapsody, Hey Jude, Let it be, Michelle, This Masquerade, Theme from Mahogany, You've got a friend, Fire and Rain, It's too late, I say a little prayer, I fall to pieces, Heartbreak Hotel, My sweet Lord, Sweet Caroline, Angel by Sarah McLachlan, La Bamba, Fool on the Hill, Rockin Robin, Just the way you are, She's always a woman, Sorry seems to be the hardest word, Something, Here comes the sun, While my guitar gently weeps, What the world needs now, Yesterday.

She would pick a central female character who was beautiful, cavort with the rich and famous and Hollywood's elite, and jetset off to exotic locales. She might be a bitch or drama queen and flawed, yet intriguing,and a survivor.  Naturally, there would be a plethora of high octane sexual encounters.<br /><br />Of course, the main difference is Jackie Collins work was fiction, with names altered to protect the guilty. This is the real deal, and proof that truth is not only stranger than fiction but ultimately more interesting. Real names are used such as Jack Nicholson, Sly Stallone, Bruce Willis, Mick Jagger, and Warren Beatty, but strangely enough no mention of Dustin Hoffman LOL.<br /><br />I have noticed myself that some women who have an abusive father, hate the parent, also hate themselves because they accept and agree with what is being said.<br /><br />Yet, ironically they become what they hate most, and act out in similar ways as the parent ie they unconsciously go looking for the familiar ie an abusive jerk thinking that scorn will somehow turn into approval. Or, as in this case also become self destructive, and abuse drugs and alcohol.<br /><br />If they do meet someone who is decent, then they become (what they hate)the abuser to provoke the abuse.  It's a no win situation. It is interesting to see how she finally gets to grip with this in the end, her epiphany.  For that alone this book is well worth reading.<br /><br />She did treat one decent guy particularly badly. He wasn't contrary enough. She slept with two other guys in the same week, rubbed his nose in it, left him and got pregnant. But who was the father? Was it the movie star, the artist guy her friend set her up with, or her boyfriend, the Hollywood movie producer?<br /><br />I have to say this book is well written, and I read it over a weekend. She tells her tale with  indefatigable alacrity, to use two of her favorite words.	2004-07-26

Erickson	Books	5	334	337	N	N	It's all in the mind	I had read about Erickson as the pioneer of NLP, and his work in hypnosis  and psychotherapy and was intrigued.  This book is a great introduction to Erickson.<br /><br />These stories are case studies, people with all sorts of problems, and very interesting solutions, and great stories.<br /><br />This guy is a genius. From bedwetting to alcoholism, to repression, I was particularly inspired by a very short story about the Turmahara Indians, and how knowing and thinking about their special abilities can increase your energy levels. If it works for me, it might work for you.<br /><br />There was one story about how he treated one woman who was sexually unresponsive, and through using his storytelling method caused her to have an orgasm in his office without touching her! Before reading this book I had not realised how easily influenced we can be by indirect suggestion, and how powerful his techniques are.<br /><br />Essentially this is a book of anecdotes, with the author who is himself a psychiatrist giving an explanation of the methods and techniques being used by Erickson.<br /><br />Apart from the therapeutic benefits, if you read this book you can really improve your communication and storytelling skills if you follow the principles used here, so I would recommend this book to aspiring story tellers.<br /><br />Think of Erickson as someone who was a master of effecting life altering personal change by being able to communicate on a deeper level. Applied to yourself you can most likely imagine the effect you can have on yourself and others and how you can win friends and influence people by learning this skill.<br /><br />For more case studies, check out Conversations with Milton H. Erickson Vol 1 by Jay Haley.  You might find situations in there that relate to issues in your own life.  In fact, use the look inside feature and check out the index.  I found the chapter on public speaking and performance anxiety quite helpful. Also, check out the Patterns of... Erickson book by Richard Bandler, which gives a a complete analysis of Erickson's induction methods.<br /><br />Hope you found this helpful.complete analysis of Erickson's induction methods.

And I'm Perfect	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Catchy title...good read	I had never heard of her before seeing this book.<br /><br />I was drawn by the catchy title, and intrigued by the book itself.<br /><br />She has a lot of great stories to tell, and I was definitely hooked. She has a chapter in the book about how to deal with men, which is..the Janice version of The Rules..and how to keep your men well behaved. Well, it's appalling to think that there are guys out there with more dollars than sense who put up with this B.S.  Can you imagine guys actually falling for this?<br /><br />One way to keep an inattentive lover in line, is the jealousy/imaginary lover routine. She sends herself flowers signed from you know who and then pretends to be shocked when she thanks the actual boyfriend for his thoughtful gift. I wonder how many women actually use this routine. I have to admit this is a good one. There are several more shocking routines.<br /><br />Warning. Some of these routines would only work for really hot women.<br /><br />I found myself appalled by her behavior yet fascinated by her personality and character. Entertaining.<br /><br />I hope this review  was helpful.	2004-07-21

When originally released this book was controversial. The Pope at the time said, 'those who read this book will understand.' The whole set is five books totaling over 4,200 pages.<br /><br />Whether one  believes these visions or not is not essential to the enjoyment of the book. You can be rightly sceptical, and still enjoy the book.<br /><br />Mostly, I get a very strong visual sense of all the characters as if I am looking at a visual portrait of all the events described, almost as if you were there yourself at times.<br /><br />What I notice most when reading this book is that these are first person accounts ie by Jesus himself, and not third party revelations as the gospels are.  While the gospels tend to report the facts Jesus goes into more detail here.  During the passion for example he explains in detail why Mary Magdalene was not allowed to touch him when he appeared to her, whereas others were.  There are more details about the crucifixion here, the flight of the apostles, the guilt of Peter, the agony and temptation of Mary.  The more you read the story, at least for me, the more you feel like an observer at these key events.<br /><br />Another strong feeling I get is that we all go through periods of suffering in our lives, we suffer to live, and suffer in the face of death, and yet our suffering does not compare with that of Jesus himself, and this puts our personal suffering in perspective.<br /><br />I must say I am impressed with this book, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.	2004-04-27

I also have the sight reading secrets book by Richman, which I have reviewed separately.<br /><br />I was trying to decide between both these books when buying originally.  While the other book contains some very good tips, this book is more comprehensive and is widely used as a text book for musicians.<br /><br />It is very well organised, and well written in the style of a sight reading course, and has good rhythm and sight reading exercises to work on before doing the specific examples which are done in a variety of contemporary styles including rock bebop and Latin Jazz. The examples are interesting and not too complicated. As with many things, the more you practice, the more you improve to the point where you are naturally better.<br /><br />I consider this better than the Richman book, although that book really helped me with breaking down more complicated rhythms, and I do recommend both books.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.	2003-12-08

You can practice while driving for example.<br /><br />As I have been getting speech singing vocal training for over a year, I can testify to the value of the method.<br /><br />Unless you are already a well trained singer with good technique, you really should not use this type of course without also getting lessons. A vocal trainer can identify how to improve tone, breathing etc and point out technique errors such as overblow or too much air pressure, which you might never identify by yourself.  It is so easy to damage your voice by using incorrect technique or overdoing the exercises.<br /><br />After using this for a few days and then applying the technique to sing along to a recording, I was able to do so without straining and hitting higher notes than usual with much less effort, which was amazing. I am now on my way to a voice that I did not dare to dream was possible.<br /><br />The second CD is more about applying the exercises and producing the speech level singing tone, and runs through song examples using those passage areas with very useful tips to avoid splattering your sound.<br /><br />For less than the cost of a voice lesson this is a great investment, which I highly recommend.  You can imagine how helpful this is.  The more you use this method, the more you will improve to the point where you will have the voice you have always dreamed of having.  I wonder if you found this helpful.<br /><br />Since writing this review originally, I met a woman, a singer songwriter from Australia, who sung the wrong way.  As a result she damaged her voice.  She was told by doctors that she would never be able to sing again.  Her only hope would be if she stopped speaking for a year.  She did this communicating by notepad.  She lost some of her social skills.

So, I find it to be a very good book.<br /><br />It is a short book which I think is good, the drills are short and easy to run through, especially with practice.  Some of the later references in the book are a little confusing, and the book could be better organized.<br /><br />This book does not have all the answers, which is why I do not give it the full 5 stars.

I borrowed this book off my brother and read it in two days.<br /><br />It is very good and well written. Fr Amorth could easily have taken the more sensationalistic route. Instead he also explores and challenges some conventional religious theories and explains these very well. His role is first and foremost a ministry, and an important one.<br /><br />The case studies that he refers to are all very interesting. But more interesting than this is the importance of leading a spiritual life. Some of the sacraments actually are akin to exorcism, going to confession, taking communion and baptism for example.<br /><br />He cites scripture to challenge and clarify some common perceptions.<br /><br />Topics include: why the world and humankind was created, predestiny and freedom of choice, why bad things happen to good people, if God has ultimate control then doesn't everything happen with his permission. I had always struggled with the issue of predestiny until I read this book. It is finally explained to my satisfaction.<br /><br />He has divided devilish interference into several categories. The most interesting to me were oppression which I did not even realise on a conscious level, and extraordinary activity.<br /><br />For example, if you are subject to oppressive or negative thoughts or obsess about a person or situation, these may be signs of oppression. There are several great prayers in this book to help you deal with these issues.<br /><br />I was expecting to read about a subject which I was curious about, but it relates to everybody's experience with the ordinary and extraordinary challenges we face as we try to lead exemplary lives.<br /><br />This is a very important book which I would recommend to anyone interested in spiritual themes and not just people interested only in this subject matter.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.	2003-01-07

This lady is a leading vocal trainer.<br /><br />I sing with a group, and have had many of the common problems such as inconsistency in the voice, some days note perfect, other days cracking and straining on the higher notes.<br /><br />The disc itself is very well explained and easy to follow, the first half comprising an explanation and run through of each exercise. The second half being a straight run through the warm up routine.<br /><br />I recommend this cd and her web site where there are useful articles on technique which I have found invaluable. These have enabled me to improve the resonance of my voice and expand my range considerably with almost immediate effect after correcting poor technique, such as tongue and throat tension, overblow, using more force and effort to hit higher notes etc. Beatles songs that were two or three tones above my natural key are now within my range. Wow!<br /><br />The exercises on this cd are consistent with many of the exercises we use warming up for a performance but the full explanation of why we do each exercise really helps, and these warm ups make a considerable difference to the quality of performance. These should be considered warm ups only, and not actually exercises to improve the voice.<br /><br />Every singer should have a warm up routine, and this is it.

This is a full version of the Gospels, a far more detailed account of the Life of Jesus than you get in the Bible, based on the revelations to/visions of Maria Valtorta. This book has had some controversy about being accepted by the Church, which is understandable, for the line between revelation and delusion can be a thin one.    Nevertheless, I find this work to be very authentic, inspiring, detailed and visual. It is almost like being there, and it is very difficult not to be struck by the power of the words of Jesus, and I find it in some respects even more illuminating than the Bible.    For example, in The Bible when the disciples asked Jesus to teach them how to pray like he does, he taught them the Our Father, which takes up two paragraphs of text.     In this book the whole sequence runs to several pages. Jesus goes into much more detail saying why this is the most perfect prayer, and then proceeds to explain each line and its meaning. Some of the words of the prayer as recounted here are different, but to me actually clearer than in the standard version, eg 'hallowed be thy name'becomes 'may your name be kept holy' and 'lead us not into temptation' is 'do not put us to the test but deliver us from the evil one.'     I find it impossible to believe that anybody could create a staggering work like this and dream up anything as profound as the words of Jesus as recounted here.     If you are questing after spiritual truth, this book will definitely help you on your journey, and I highly recommend it. I look forward to buying the other volumes in the future.

He was able to tell people all about their departed loved ones without requesting information or input of any kind.  I was so impressed I bought the book.<br /><br />This book is written by a highly sceptical radio personality, who has used every means at his disposal to debunk the whole medium idea. George Anderson cooperated with the book and the testing.<br /><br />I was particularly interested to read some of the case studies, understand some of the rationale behind after death communications. It helped to understand in depth the passing of my brother, and by being able to get this perspective to deal with it better.  I was also very interested in what he said about the nature of the afterlife.  There is no hell per se, there are just different levels based on how spiritually advanced people were in life.<br /><br />This is the kind of book to read when you need to read it, when the time is right.  I passed my copy along to my sister who was also very impressed and she in turn passed it along to someone who found it to be a great comfort.  This book could be helpful to someone you know.<br /><br />In grief, the one piece of knowledge that might help you get the perspective that helps you to deal with the loss can be so elusive.  This book can help you.  I would also recommend Lessons from the Light, which focuses more on the afterlife.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.	2001-05-30

It is hard to imagine McCartney being insecure  about anything, but he certainly seems territorial, protective and  sensitive of his own legacy.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest injustice to  McCartney was being inducted to Rock and Roll Hall of fame seven years  after Lennon, in spite of being an equal contributor to the Beatles, and  having a far more commercially successful solo career.<br /><br />As far as the  Lennon McCartney compositions go, there are a few surprises, for instance,  he says he wrote the music to 'In My Life' a song which is obviously very  Lennon but this actually makes sense.  On many of the other Lennon songs he  wrote the middle eight or the words of the last verse and vice versa.  At  times this seems petty, but to be fair he does give Lennon credit on some  songs that are obviously strongly McCartney compositions such as the middle  sections of Michelle and She's Leaving Home, and a 50/50 credit on I saw  her standing there. On Eleanor Rigby he credits Lennon some of the lyrics  to the final verse, although in the Anthology documentary he says the song  is 100% his. The key to crediting any Lennon McCartney song is he who sung  it wrote it or most of it.<br /><br />The most interesting portions of this book are  the direct quotations by McCartney about his life, his relationship with  John and the other Beatles and his relationship with Linda, and his  insights into John and the meaning of many of his songs which are the best  I've read.  He is surprisingly candid and open, compared to tv interviews  where he has rarely allowed interviewers to get behind the McCartney  persona.<br /><br />Some of his comments about John are quite touching. The history  of how he met Linda, and how their relationship developed is a compelling  love story.<br /><br />For instance we get to hear about the death of Paul's mother  when he was 14, the tragic death of John's mother the business relationship  with Brian Epstein, the Apple fiasco,the wrangling, the naivety of the  Beatles in business matters, the loss of ownership of their songs and so  forth.<br /><br />As for Mr Miles himself, he is not the world's greatest writer,  which is why I only give it 3 stars. The chapter on avantgarde London is  the most boring thing I have ever read. He could easily have edited 100  pages out of this book without compromising the content.<br /><br />In addition, he  is obviously biased towards McCartney and disses Lennon by act and  omission. He zeroes in on McCartney as a painter making him out to be a  better artist than Lennon, and making the most pretensious comparisons  between McCartney's art and classic painters.<br /><br />He doesn't seem to  understand that by undermining Lennon he is also undermining McCartney's  credibility. Fortunately, McCartney's own comments are far more respectful,  and seemingly objective.<br /><br />In Mr Miles favour, I must say there are very  few questions about McCartney that are left unanswered, and in spite of all  its obvious flaws this is still the best psychological insight into Paul  McCartney and John Lennon that I have read, so I would recommend this book.  I would strongly recommend the books by Hunter Davies and Philip Norman.  I hope this review was helpful.sona.     Some of his comments about John are quite touching.

For example,  did you know that Roll over Beethoven was inspired by McCartney trying to  teach his English sheepdog some new tricks.<br />I echo the author's  sentiments, this book really should be out there.	2000-05-22

This is particularly true on piano based hits such as Hey  Jude, Let it Be, Yesterday, Lady Madonna, Back in the USSR etc.<br /><br />This book  gets the original arrangements as played by the Beatles which are generally  much better and actually easier to play a lot of times. You can discern  McCartney's piano style which is not technically difficult. After all you  are accompanying a voice and not playing a melody.<br /><br />So when you play Let it Be it sounds so much better, and with Hey Jude you think that's all  he did to make that sound. Lady Madonna enables you to sound ridiculously  accomplished playing something that is technically quite easy. Obviously I  am approaching this from a piano player's viewpoint.<br /><br />As far as guitar is concerned, it has very authentic transcriptions, certainly on the fingerpicking songs such as Blackbird and Julia, which are not that difficult to reproduce.<br /><br />I have found this  book to be unbelievably helpful. You are getting some of the Beatles trade  secrets here. You finally get to see the outside the box thinking that  separated the Beatles from the rest. I rate this book the best sheet music investment I have ever made, and a must for any aspiring musician. The genius is in the details.<br /><br />I hopethis review was helpful.	2000-05-09

Particularly offensive is the outrageous suggestion that Stuart Sutcliffe an early Beatles band member and John's best friend died from Lennon kicking him in the head, and allegedly also had a sexual relationship with Lennon.<br /><br />Ok, we all know Lennon was flawed  and insecure and paranoid and who wouldn't be having been abandoned by both  parents as a child, and then as an adult having achieved fame wondering if  people were interested in him because they genuinely liked him or wanted to  exploit his fame and wealth.<br /><br />But this guy really goes beyond the pale by  trotting out every half truth and rumor, and presenting it as the truth. If  you are a Lennon  fan and really want to read this book, just pop into your  local bookstore and browse through it, you will get the general flavor. Do  not reward this guy for pandering to the lowest common denominator.	2000-05-04

'Tis left me wanting more, for different reasons. It is, as if, he wrote about his life and left out the interesting bits. For example, there is very little  mention of his wife from whom he got divorced.  The little mention given  here only hints at what could have been a very compelling story. He goes on  at length about his eyes (the infection), and then stops writing about them  without finishing that story line. I understand that Angela's Ashes was  refined from years of performing a one man show. That tried and tested  approach shows in the quality of writing, but he seems less sure here. It  seems all the best material was used in the first book, and all the good  material in this book was used in the earlier stages. The last part of this  book just seemed to drag.  Overall, it is a little disappointing, although  the immigrant story will be uncharted territory and therefore interesting  to many readers	2000-04-07
