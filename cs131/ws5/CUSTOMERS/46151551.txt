However, this book's purpose is to give you the feel of Britannia during the post-Roman era.  It was a time of myth and fantasy, chivalry and heroism, as this book reflects.	2003-05-27

It's the common-sense advice that your parents and grandparents gave you.  <br />The main point of this book is to give you kick in the tail and motivate you.  It succeeded for me, so I'd definitely recommend it.  Five stars all the way.	2002-10-25

I don't know that any one review can do justice to this book, but I will contribute mine, in order to help anyone considering buying Your Erroneous Zones.<br />In short, this book is no less than the basis for modern psychology.  If you have been to counseling, literally all the general advice you will ever receive is derived from this book.  The goal of every one of us to to become self-actualized.  <br />A self-actualized person is someone who is happy and enjoys life no matter what their circumstances are.  As Dyer says, happiness always comes from within.  We are happy when we choose to be happy.   <br />The \\"erroneous zones\\" are negative, pointless emotions such as worry, guilt, depression, helplessness, anger, and neediness.  We can choose not to feel those emotions.  We can also choose to stop procrastinating.  <br />Our happiness, again, comes completely from within.  There are some things that we cannot change, such as injustice, poverty, and crime, can work to solve those worldly problems without choosing to feel depressed and helpless.  <br />Your Erroneous Zones is filled to the brim with pearls of wisdom.  I find myself constantly re-reading the book in order to make new discoveries.  Today, for example, I pondered this statement by Dyer: \\"Make a decision to live five minutes at a time.\\"   <br />When we do that, then procrastination becomes pointless.  Feeling unhappy becomes pointless.  Dwelling on mistakes from the past becomes pointless.  Boredom becomes pointless.  (es, boredom is another emotion that we choose to feel.)<br />How do you feel right now?  And why did you choose to feel that way?  The bottom line is that we choose the way we want to feel...	2002-07-07

If you like a book, give it five stars, not four.  Now, my opinion of the book.<br />This book is packed with goodies for every knitter. It shows basic knitting stitches, explains the harder stitches, and it has a collection of patterns that you can incorporate into your own knitwear designs.<br />There are different chapters in this book that talk about knit and pearl designs (basic stitches in knitting), cable stitches, color patterns and patterns for texture. There is also a chapter on finishing your projects (putting them together properly) and then a small chapter on how to design your own knitwear (putting different touches and patterns on the same general idea, but making it your own and different.).<br />In each of the chapters in the book, she carefully goes over how to do it, tips for doing it where it looks good, and then there are projects to complete using these skills you just learned.	2002-04-27

It's true what they say--when there is a push to ban a book, it makes the book explode in popularity.<br />Anyway, one does need to read this book realizing that it was written during the height of the racialist/eugenicist era, when even the President (Woodrow Wilson) fell into that ideological category.  However, ninety-nine percent of the book passes the test to be approved as PC in this modern hyper-sensitive era.<br />Most of the interpretations of the dreams are probably fanciful at best, but this books makes for interesting reading.

This book is one of those undiscovered treasures that really should have been more popular than it was.  A lot of us know that Washington D.C.'s mayor was arrested for crack cocaine, but we really never got the inside story just from reading the papers.  Agronsky dug deeper, and presents his findings in such a way that it makes for fascinating reading.  <br />Marion Barry's behavior is presented in a non-judgmental manner, I thought.  Indeed, Barry's actions spoke for themselves.  We all saw the surveillance tape of Barry smoking the crack pipe, but Agronsky gives us the full story of what went on behind the scenes.  Yes, it was disturbing to see the mayor of this country's capital city smoking crack cocaine; however, as Agronsky reveals, Barry at first resisted smoking the crack, because he wanted to lay off the pipe.  It was only after a lot of prodding that Barry finally took a few hits.<br />...Was he set up?  Judge for yourself.<br />To me, it was interesting how nobody was blameless in the whole Barry crack scandal.  To be sure, Barry himself was a scumbag.  (He went up to the hotel room to cheat on his wife, which itself is bad enough.)  But the feds who busted him did not strike me as being much higher in character than Barry.  <br />My only gripe with the book is that it was not long enough.  Agronsky relates the story of the sting operation in rich detail, but by the end of the book, he fast-forwards through time, squeezing months into each chapter.<br />Agronsky is a superb investigative reporter, and I wish he would write more books!	2002-03-13

This isn't a book of fantasy and magic, after all.<br />Also, the language is unnecessarily vile at times, which can be distracting, especially during romantic scenes when Brown is trying to set the mood.  <br />Now that I've gotten the caveats out of the way, this novel *is* suspenseful, especially as you get toward the end.

The Pimsleur method of teaching languages is very effective in my opinion, so I wish more companies and schools would adopt it.  Basically, the Pimsleur method is to teach you to converse in the language and become comfortable in the language through talking out loud.<br />You learn new words slowly and incrementally, and there's ample review, in order to ensure that the words and sentences become engrained in your mind.<br />The Pimsleur tapes essentially try to simulate immersing you in the language, which you would of course have to go to France or Quebec to do normally!<br />If you're new to French and want to get comfortable with the language, check out these tapes.	2001-12-26

It teaches you how to play, using simple, straight-forward diagrams that anyone can understand.  This book is absolutely unparalleled when it comes to teaching someone the basics of the game.  It covers everything, from opening moves, to the middle game, all the way to checkmate situations.<br />If you're already above the novice stage, don't waste your time with this, but if you're a beginner, get this book!  I can't recommend it highly enough to people who are starting out.	2001-12-20

Or have a paper to write.<br />Or do you just want to be entertained?  Here are a few gems:<BR>Did you know that R-rated movies have more violence than X-rated?<BR>Did you know that the Soviet Union had 100 times more movie theaters than the US in 1990?  (Geez, I can't imagine how bad their films must have been though!)	2001-12-19
