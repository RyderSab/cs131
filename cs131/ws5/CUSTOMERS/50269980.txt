Because, sometimes, I sequel is not needed to understand the  characters. That's why I wonder if Thomas Harris should have written this  book.<br />         Just in the beginning, you realize that there will be many  surprises on the story. And that's the good point on the book, at least in  the beginning. The problem is that Thomas Harris told everything about his  most famous character, Hannibal Lecter. He probably didn't remember that  good stories shouldn't be told twice. Mary Shelley didn't have to write two  books to make Frankenstein a classic. Bram Stoker didn't have to do it to  make Dracula a classic. But if Thomas Harris felt that way, who can blame  the creator for doing what he's done to his creature? No one.<br />          And although the reader will see many surprises - many of them which they  won't like - , the reading is not terrible. The book is a very enjoyable  piece, and you feel compelled all the time. Then comes the ending of the  story... Well, who can blame the creature?<br />         Time will say if this  is a book Thomas Harris will regret for have written it or not. The readers  already made their choice.<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-09-09

As another reader said, this is a good book, but it takes too long to  actually begin. The whole book, of almost 450 pages takes 140 to really  start, and that was the really first mistake Nora Roberts commited.<br />          The whole story develops wonderfully. The reader is kept reading,  reading and wanting nothing more but to read the book, and you just feel  you're reading one of the best books ever. The second problem is: Nora  makes the most terrible mistake when dealing with a murder book: develops  grately some characters and forget others. The result? Soon the reader  knows who the killer is. And to make things even worse, the reason for the  killer to have done is already known since the beginning... What's left for  the reader to enjoy, then? <br />         We can now just watch what will  happen to all the characters. By the end of the book Nora commits the third  mistake: she wrote scenes that we are tired of seeing: woman that hates man  decides he's the man of her life, woman regreting what has done too late,  when man is already dying etcetera. <br />         But the overquality is  nice, and the book is a good reading. It was a perfect entertainment to me,  even knowing everything and the plot seeming a little trite. But that's OK.  Nora is always Nora. Said that, just read the book and have fun!<br />Marco  Aurelio.	2000-09-09

Tom Clancy wrote the book that will keep readers turning  the page late at night, and even with the almost thousand of pages we are  used to on Clancy's book, this one, better than every other, does not makes  the reader feel tired a single page. At least, not until the characters  seem a little bit from early books.<br />         And, even better, the  amazing character John Clark is in this tale too, what only makes it even  better.

Found it a bit dull. But then, last year, Thomas Harris released HANNIBAL,  and it gave me some input again because I wanted to read the sequel, and to  read it, I didn't want to without reading the part one, last call it so.<br />          Then, when I started reading it finally, I took only two days to  read it. Though, I really saw no reason for this book to be that famous.  <br />         It's the kind of book you do enjoy reading. It has many  detective and psychological elements that makes the reader want to know  what's next. Clarice Starling is a loving character, and Dr. Hannibal  Lecter is really a complete enigma. He's so good you hate because he  doesn't appear so much in the book as you'd like to. I think the book would  be better if Dr. Lecter appeared more often in the plot.<br />         Anyway,  it's a very good reading. The kind of book you read fast and reaches the  ending thinking you've just read a nice work. Thomas Harris is really a  good author. But we have to admit, the wonderful movie based on this book  was really what made the book in fact be so famous. Though, THE SILENCE OF  THE LAMBS is really the kind of book for any lover of the genre to read.  Even because this book was the first real thriller ever written, that  inspired many other books. You won't be disappointed. It's really  worthwhile.<br />Also recommended: THE BONE COLLECTOR, by Jeffery  Deaver<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-08-19

Then, I took THE WINNER. That was my first try on his  books.<br />         The plot revolves around a woman called LuAnn, who is the  mother of a baby and lives with a man who only cares for drinking, a  vagabond. Besides, she works has a waitress half the day to make only a  very little money. Then, one day, a man called Jackson tells her she can  win the national lottery. How? He has all the numbers of the next draw.  LuAnn doesn't know, but if she say yes, she'll be one of the most rich  women of the world. If she say no, she'll be a dead woman. <br />          Decided to say no because she's not the kind of woman to accept illegal  things, she arrives at home and finds a man decided to kill... the man she  lives with. But the man is already dead. Then some things I'm not going to  tell happen, and she start thinking she's the main suspect of the crime  (both her &quot;husband&quot; and the man she found on her home (a trailer)  are found dead). Trying to escape from the police, she accept Jackson's  opportunity and goes to New York, where she wins the lottery. This is just  the beginning of a wonderful book, one of the best thrillers I've ever read  during my whole life (which is not a big time, but was lived with  intensity), and I discovered one of the best writers of the world. He  criated an adorable heroine, you just can't help but fall in love with  LuAnn Tyler, and also one of the most terrible vilains of the modern  literature, Mr. Jackson.<br />         Now, all I'm looking forward to is to  read the other books by David Baldacci. He's a marvelous writer. Believe me  when I say it. Read Baldacci will be an habit now to me. Long life to David  Baldacci! He deserves all the success he has been conquering. Just  amazing!<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-08-19

They said that this book from Mrs. Danielle Fernande Schulein-Steel is nothing  more than a melodrama. Don't think so.<br />         If there's one thing I  came to conclude since 1999 (yes, I might have taken too long), is that the  books by Danielle Steel are the same plot told in different ways. As  another reader said, what seem is that only the names of the characters and  their professions change, no matter if the plot takes place in New York, in  Japan or on Vietnam. It's always the same thing: a woman who suffers like  hell, who suffers even when things were seeming to go Ok. Then, when she  thinks all men in the world are &quot;the same&quot;, the knight on a white  horse appears &quot;unexpectedly&quot; on her life and they live happilly  ever after.<br />         THE LONG ROAD HOME, as all the other books by Mrs.  Steel is no different. Gabriella Harrison is a child who suffers since the  beginning of her life. Her mother is always mad it her, and spank her even  if she's happy and claims everything to be her fault. Her father watches  everything and do nothing. Then, one day, he lives her and her mother  alone. And because no one is made of steel, the mother finds another man in  her life, goes to San Francisco with him and leave Gabriella in a convent.  There she is raised by a sister that plays the role her mother didn't. When  she's twenty plus, Gabriella decides it's time to become a sister also.  Then she suffers the first tragedy of her adult life, since it couldn't be  different (remember, we are in a book by Danielle Steel). She falls in love  with a priest, and he answers the love. They soon start to make love in an  apartment of a friend of his, and... Gabriella gets pregnant! Oh-my-God!  And now? Then, the priest, who can't resist, commits suicide... Terrible,  isn't it? Yes, but that's not the end yet. Decided to stare her life with  good sense and forget her past, she goes toNew York and starts to live in  a very cheap hotel. Well, she meets all kind of people, and imagine that  she gets involved with a man she thought was the man of her dreams... But  this man also spanks her like her mother did... And there, at the hospital,  a doctor that had already ended a marriage because he couldn't give much  attention to the other spouse, decides that Gabriella is the perfect woman  he always dreamed of, and think it's time to try again. Because, of course,  the heroines Danielle Steel criates are always flawless. Who wouldn't want  to give up everything and marry them? <br />         Even being a little  melodramatic, the book made me remind of another one I loved (MALICE), and  I think that's the main reason why I enjoyed that one. It's not as dull as  I thought at first, and, even to a male audience, the book, that has always  the same quantity of suffer and tragedy all her past ones does, is a good  reading. A book for fans and for people who enjoy the genre.<br />Marco  Aurelio.	2000-08-14

It is written in a very interesting, cold-blooded way fans of  the genre love to read. Besides, it's also one that Kay Scapetta, the  former detective on Cornwell's books, has her better way of searching for  clues and findind the truth.<br />         What's interesting in Patricia  Cornwell's writing and being specific, in this book, is how deep things are  described. Although Her style is the kind that describes every spot of  blood, it's not terrible because you are always portraited to the scene of  the crime, you feel as if you were there, with all the policemen and  detectives... And, even without describe the characters much, Patricia  Cornwell has an adorabl way of giving insights into the lives of her  characters, and they are just like everyone, with the happiness and the  problems. <br />         Read a book by Patricia Cornwell is always a pleasure  - full of aches and pains, but it's good to take the risk - , and, even not  being a reading as great as a story full of what you could expect, Patricia  knows exactly how to give the reader all we could expect from this kind of  book. She's a master with what she does. <br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-08-05

Besides the fact that this book was the first published book by Stephen  King, it has nothing that claims for attention, nothing special.<br />          Sometimes known as an author for teenagers, Stephen King shows in that book  why. The plot, that is not very rich - but is powerful, revolves around a  teenager who doesn't know nothing about the world becauser her mother is a  religion fanatic, and think this world is crazy - well, I wouldn't disagree  with that hehe - and think that it would be better to lock her daughter  inside her houser than let her become a lost soul in this world. The other  girls tease her because of her innocence, and people find her ridiculous in  general. And, much to her mother's chagrin, she also has a power called  telecinesy, through whick she can move what and whoever she wants just  looking and wanting to do it. The problem is that this power is not under  her control - and that's when the horror begins - and she gives pain even  for the ones who do not deserve it.<br />         The plot is good, and I  couldn't think of it in another way better than the way it was written...  Not exactly the way, but the scenarios where it took place: house of  Carrie, School, end of grade's day... All in a small town. The book,  completely different in its taste and matureness, hold the reader, yes, but  books like IT, THE SHINING, PET SEMATARY and CHRISTINE are obviously much  better than that book. Anyway, this is a wonderful Stephen King piece as  any other could be. Ever a joy!<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-08-05

That was one of the first books by Dean Koontz I've read, when I almost didn't know his writing, and I loved it.<br />  This is the kind of  book you read in only one blink. The characters and the plot are so huge,  so deep and well-written that you feel as if you were there suffering and  having fun with them.<br />  Everything starts when a woman is killed  by monsters that are something like gorillas. Then, her sister, a FBI  officer, a retired policeman and a child who is being threatened by her own  parents get together unexpectdly to solve the problems and save their own  life.<br />  MIDNIGHT is a book for lovers of the horror genre, the  suspense and the thriller. It's a book you'll never forget because of its  hugeness, of its power. Nowadays, Dean doesn't write this kind of book  anymore, and yes, I miss that. This is the kind of book you could keep  reading forever. If you haven't read that one yet, take it! If you haven't  read a book by Dean yet and want to try him, that's a wonderful first step.  The important is, read it! And never be able to forget this wonderful  plot.<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-08-05

His latest books are not up to his  real standard. That's not what happens with this 1994 wonderful book,  though.<br />         The plot, wonderfully conceived, is a real thriller of  suspense. The characters, the very well-developed three main characters,  are just as funny and smart as your best friend. And actually this is the  kind of feeling you get from the three doctors you have the chance to meet  on this book. <br />         From beginning to end, Sidney Sheldon hooks you  until the very end! That's the kind of book you read, read, read and want  it never to end, and, when it does, you miss a lot the places and people  you've met. It's the kind of story that remains on your mind for many  years. The kind of book you tell everyone to read, and that everyone just  can't help but read and adore.

Mary Higgins Clark is the kind of author that, without arguments that  could explain, are a phenomenon and with every new book, sell millions and  millions of copies. Mary is obviously copycating the genre Agatha Christie  became imortal: the detective books. The difference is addressed in the  fact that, since it couldn't be different, Mary's books are written in a  modern age, when things can't be explained just by showing evidences...   <br />         In this just good book, Mary Higgins Clark tell us a story  where a woman witnessess a murder... and from day to night becomes the  killer's next prey. Then, she has to be 24 hours a day under police eye, in  order not to be killed. Mary Higgins Clark's books follow a formula, and it  could be different: the reader pretend the plot is original, pretend the  story haven't being told yet, pretend it's a very wonderful thing and  everyone goes home happy.<br />         As in all her books from the past, we  see losts o confusing characters, a plot that is not well specified since  the beginning, and so many characters that sometimes makes it confusing  even to the reader, with scenes of suspense that everyone who likes the  genre could write.<br />         Of course, people wouln't agree with that  much. A reader saying bad things about the master Mary Higgins Clark! What  a 'master' we've found... Anyway, the book in overall is not that bad. It  has good characters and the plot satisfies the reader at the end. As for a  modern disciple of Agatha Christie, Mary H. Clark is not doing that  bad.<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-08-05

His books, that are usually known as books full of sex, intrigue, passion and  hatred, don't have good stories that keep the reader on the edge of the  seat, on the other hand.<br />         And that's not different with that  book. Although the story at first seem interesting, soon it starts to get  pretty trite, but what really matter in this book is that Harold tried to  fit in every empty space scenes of pure sex, a characteristic that made him  famous worldwide. <br />         Although his books have more sex and erotic  scenes than a real good story, this book is interesting and a good reading.  It's the kind of book that you enjoy reading even though you feel disgusted  when you read some parts of the book, like a woman who has sexual relations  with her brother and even get pregnant of him... And he describes the sex  scenes, that's what most terrible. Though, these scenes are interesting  because it's not the kind of thing you usually see in books. Harold Robbins  was brave enough to brake some taboos, and that's great. Reading this book  is just a great fun, nothing else. But it's worthwhile. It's always (or  almost always) worthwhile. Even if you don't like the books, at least you  learn lots of new ways and positions of making sex!<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-08-05

A book by Danielle Steel is always a book with the Danielle Steel brand,  as if you were seeing a &quot;TM&quot; or a R inside of a circle by the  side of her name. You go to the bookshop and choose your book by her like  you choose your favorite brand of candies.<br />         As a male fan, I have  to say that her new books have been seeming fairly trite to me. Books like  SPECIAL DELIVERY, for example, are the kind of ones that she seem to write  only to make money. The plot of the book is poor, with no deep characters  and no deep insight on the plot itself. I think she'll never write a book  like THE RING, MALICE or THURSTON HOUSE anymore. They now seem to me like  things from a far past. These books have all the elements that her latest  ones don't: a real good story, with characters that seem to make part of  your life that you miss when finish the book.<br />         When I read a new  book by Danielle Steel, what I feel now is that she has forgotten how to  write a good bestseller. Even in good new ones, like The Long Road Home,  what she's being doing most is a big and boring melodrama (although in that  one the reader can see a little bit of good plot). And that's what she's  done with that terrible book, that revolves around a couple that begins  hating themselves and then loving each other more than life. Have you ever  perceived how Danielle Steel makes even bretrayl and cheating seem to be a  good, right and excellent thing to be done? That's a reason why I like her:  the gift to persuade the reader and turn a bad thing into a good one. But  it seems as she's now deceiving her readers too much. Her present books are  not up to her best ones. Not the ones like the boring SPECIAL DELIVERY,  anyway. A book that I finished reading only because it has just a few  pages. One page more and I would scream. Terrible, boring and dull. The  kind of book that means nothing, as if you were reading blank pages. I  think she should return to the road where she oncewas.<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-08-05

They say the modern romantic literature is now written in a funny, desperate and more feminist way. I disagree with that. Taking the famous  Bridget Jones as an example, I have to say that, even being a little funny  the first time, to a male audience, the second book about this character  didn't seem as fetching as the first one. While one was a bit funny and  interesting to a man, the second one seemed slow, repetitive and not as  good.<br />         And to the few male audience Danielle Steel has, since the  overwhelming audience is made of women, this does not happen with Danielle  Steel anyway. Although her books have always the same kind of plot: a  person who suffers from beginning to end - usually a woman - finding at  that end a person to love and live happilly ever after - her books are  interesting, they have a real plot, and they are a good reading because  they portrait people like us all. They seem real, while the  &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; ones usually don't portrait a real  person to the reader, but a kind of freak that is usually presented to the  reader in a way almost like a caricature.<br />         Danielle Steel knows  how to portrait to the reader everything. Since the dramas and suffering  everyone feels during a lifetime, and the happiness, joy and pleasure to  live we all have.<br />         That's exactly what happens with this book.  THURSTON HOUSE has all this. Even being a little melodramatic with some  destination the characters take, the book has also many enjoyable scenes,  showing to the reader she has many things to offer as a real modern  novelist. This book is everything you could expect from a book like that.  And I'm quite sure that, if you like this kind of stories, you'll love that  one, whick to me is one of Danielle's best books. If you don't like that  genre but is curious on how it works, this is also a great reading. The  only thingyou can't do is miss this book. You have to read that one and be  as hooked as I was when I read it. <br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-07-29

I have some things to say about it, anyway.<br />         The  plot is perfectly sewed, the action really belongs to an adventure and he  knew exactly how to deal with it. And although his characters seemed to be  people made of cardboard (you start and end the plot without know not even  a bit more than you knew when you begun the reading), it doesn't matter  much, since the plot is well developed. <br />         With pleasure, I'd say  that the beginning is one of the best I've ever read, and I'm thankful I  was able to read a whole book by Grisham. Since that one, I started three  other books by Grisham and didn't finish any of them. But with that one  things worked different, and it just amazing that it happened. This is by  far Grisham's best book, believe me. <br />         Well, to end what I have  to say about it, just take it and have fun! Even not finding nothing  special with Grisham, and personally finding Lisa Scottoline, who writes  his same genre, much better than him, with that one, he showed me he had  something good to offer at least. And, although this book lacks at the end  (I've already heard he's not good with endings) THE TESTAMENT is great fun.  Enjoy!<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-07-26

But when I started reading this one, I had to admit: Interview With the Vampire is really a very original book, something that readers of  the genre were really in need since Bram Stoker's Dracula. <br />         But  there's a huge problem: Anne Rice hasn't done a single original vampire  book since that one. They are only copies and copies of this one. In other  words, a shame. Though, if you like vampire tales, that one is just  wonderful well-written and a very enjoyable reading. Something you don't  find anymore. This book is really a must-read. But don't go any further on  Rice books. At least, don't expect to find the rest as interesting as that  one. Because they are not. The witch books and the rest are as good, but  the other vampire tales are not. So, in order not to hate Rice, read that  one, love that one. And stop with that one.<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-07-22

If you've seen the movie based on this book, just don't think about it: buy and read this book. You'll see that the book is lots better than the movie. They changed the plot almost completely - Hollywood is terrible  sometimes - and when you read the book, the first thing you realize in fact  are two: the book is wonderful and Michael Palmer is a wonderful writer.<br />          This book especifically, as are all his works, are full of twists,  investigation, hatred, emotion, action, adventure, suspense and everything  else you expect from this kind of reading. <br />         Writing about  Michael Palmer is almost impossible to separate him from Robin Cook,  another incredible writer. And I have to say, this book is much better than  many Cooks (though I don't doubt a single second how wonderful Cook is).  After you finish reading this book, the sensation you get is that you've  read a very well-written and one of the best medical thrillers ever. And, I  must warn ya: Michael Palmer is a specialist. He knows exactly how to  entertain you and how to give you what you want from his books. If there's  one feeling that don't show up when you finish reading one of his books is  regret. Read his books and you'll know why. He's just incredible!<br />Marco  Aurelio.	2000-07-21

The plot of this book is so huge and so powerful that you just can't help but fall in love with this book. With THE RING, for the first  time I felt portraited to World War II, I felt like I was there, suffering,  trying to survive and be happy.<br />         The plot deals with a family  saga. During three generations, you see how many things can happen to a  family that struggle to survive even passing for so many tragedies. <br />          THE RING is the kind of book you'll never forget. The third and last  part lacks a bit, being not so good as the two before, but you almost does  not perceive it, so great and wonderful is this unforgetable story that  makes all your feeling come up. Read it and see exactly why.	2000-07-13

I like Delinsky's books because they always take me to a  world that is not less real as our own, but that are at least less  problematic. It's the kind of book where you see yourself bein portraited  to a place where love, compassion and true feelings really happen. <br />          Of course, this woman, as well as her family, suffers a lot. But as it's  the kind of book where you suffer, suffer, suffer and suffer but everything  gets okay at the end, don't worry! After the fire, comes the rain. So,  SHADOWS OF GRACE it's a good entertainment for the ones who like the genre.  It's a soft, loving and adorable piece. Tea?<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-07-13

But I know that it's true. This year, I read the wonderful THE TESTAMENT. Even not being so good with the endings, Grisham knows how to  keep the pace of the book and the story interesting to read until the  end.<br />         But that's not what happens with that one. This book is a  whole terrible thing. When you start reading it, the action just in the  opening pages, you think you're up to read a book full of suspense and  twists. Soon you discover what the book is all about: a lawyer that saw a  poor man be killed under his eyes - exactly where he works, when this poor  man tried to kill him and his lawyers friends - and, with problems of his  own conscience - &quot;why haven't I given some money to the poor&quot;,  &quot;why haven't I payed attention to these people&quot; and things like  that - starts to get to know who the poor killed man was and starts to help  poor people doing charity. All this while his marriage is almost braking  and he realizes he wants to be a lawyer helping poor peopl.<br />         Be  sure that I have nothing against this subject. The problem is: the usual  suspens, twists, action and adventure we are always expection from John  Grisham does not happen with that one. Grisham, as a Baptist writer, wrote  that book certainly only to make his readers think about the poor people  and maybe to make his readers give money to them and pay more attention,  certainly unaware that give money and food to these people and not solving  the social problems is not the solution. I really think that, as popular as  John Grisham is, it would be much better using his popularity to make a  national - or perhaps an international - campaign to try to solve the  social problems that usually leads people to go to the streets and write a  book full of action and great happening instead. At least it would be  better than this dull book. Believe me. Zzzzzzzzzz...<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-07-13

That was the first book by Sidney Sheldon I read, a long time ago, and it's still my all time favorite. <br />         The story, full of twists make you  seat on the edge of the chair the whole time. You suffer, laugh, run and  have fun with the characters. It's the kind of book that Mr. Sheldon seem  to have forgotten how to write. The adorable scenarios in Spain are only a  little thing of the whole that the book shows. Believe me, reading this  book it's like watching a movie, like the ones we watch and never forget  and want everyone we know to watch it too. That's the way I feel about that  book and I guarantee you that's the way you will feel after taking this  piece with you to bed.<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-07-13

In those times her books meant everything to me, and I almost didn't read another author. In one year, I read 67 of her books. And believe me, among these 67, AN THEN  THERE WERE NONE is the best one.<br />  The plot is one of those you  don't find anymore on detective books. Ten people that don't know each  other hide something terrible of their past. They are invited to spend  sometime at a man's house - a man that no one know. And suddenly, one by  one, they are murdered in a very suspicious sometimes, sometimes terrible  and bloody way. Most of all, the ending is one of the best I've ever read.  Agatha Christie was really a wonderful writer. Her books will certainly  remain forever, since she is the Shakespeare of detective fiction. And this  book is for sure her best work. If you haven't read that one yet and you  enjoy Agatha's books, hurry up and take that one!<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-07-13

I give another  &quot;chance&quot; to the authors I didn't like when I read the first time.  That's the case of Michael Crichton. <br />         After watching lots of  wonderful movies based on his screeplays and books, I tried to read  &quot;AIRFRAME&quot;. What a disaster! Didn't like the book. But then time  passed and TIMELINE came. So I thought: the subject (time travel) is cool,  the plot seem interesting, then why not try to read it? I bought it and  started reading it the same night. When I glanced at my wristwatch, it was  midnight, I had read more than 120 pages and didn't want to go to sleep!  <br />         Even being a little complicated sometimes (not the plot itself,  but the explanations he gives for the things that happen, too tecnical) the  book is a wonderful entertainment and make you wish for much more. The  characters are well developed, the plot is very well-written and you soon  find out that Michael Crichton isn't probably the best author out there,  but he certainly has something good to offer.<br />         That's why it  makes TIMELINE a great reading. Buy it, start reading, and be prepared to  be hooked by this wonderful story!<br />Marco Aurelio.	2000-07-08

I laughed out loud and found the book to be very inventive. Other than that, even being a little crazy, she seemed like every other woman with  high hormones. <br />         In this one, Bridget Jones is just like a  caricature. Although it's good to see Bridget in other places different  than the others ones - like a travel to Tailand - , she doesn't say a  single line that doesn't seem to have been spoken by a crazy child, she is  not serious in a single chapter and seem not to have the faintest idea of  what the human being is as for their behavior and mind thinking. The book  is not as funny as the first one. I didn't laugh in a single line and it's  even dull sometimes. I think it's much better if Helen Fielding come up  with another character, because Bidget Jones is not as good as she used to  be anymore. If she writes another book like that, I think she'll perceive  that the life of Bridget Jones is not interesting to her readers as it was  once. If you wanna try it under your own risk, do it. If you have nothing  better else to read... Just don't tell me that I didn't warn ya!<br />Marco  Aurelio.	2000-06-25

MONTANA SKY is a book of feelings, and you find all of them mixed in this story. <br />         The plot runs around three sisters who are the  heirs of a just-dead man - their father. But each of these sisters didn't  know until now the existence of each other, and to own the ranch their  father leave to them, they'll have to spend a whole year together. But they  are three completely different women - and three adorable beings in their  own way. The problems begin when suddenly animals of the ranch start to be  stabbed and turned into pieces. Then, the ex-husband of one of them says  that he'll return to kill her wherever she is, and then a man is  murdered... And all this happens in beautiful scenarios... The rest you'll  have to read to find out.<br />         What I discovered by reading Nora's  books is that she's a master and gifted storyteller.

Barbara Taylor Bradford is not a perfect author. But then nobody's perfect, so why would I want perfection from her?

Barbara has a  way of telling the story that sometimes make the reader wonder why he/she  is still reading the book.

I can't say that the subject - bioguns attacks - isn't cool either. But the fatal problems are so many that the book is a whole  boring thing.<br />         After so many months waiting to have money enough  to buy it to read, I have to say: I shouldn't have expected so much of  Robin Cook. I think he will never more write books like CHROMOSOME 6, his  best in my opinion. The characters he had previously used - Jack Stapleton  and Laurie Montgomery - are here again - and in my opinion, they shouldn't.  They are not as well developed as in the previous books where they also  appear, but in this one they almost don't go to places together, and they  just don't seem to be the protagonists. The wonderful plot is not well  developed, being very boring some times. The end, which in an interview  Robin Cook said that was one of the best he ever wrote, is very  predictable. To be objective, I only read the whole book because of two  reasons: 1) It was a book by Robin Cook, and Robin Cook is always a nice  writer, even in despite of everything. 2) We always learn a lot from his  books, which is a good reason. <br />         Even giving only two stars for  this book - because it doesn't deserve more than this - it is still a nice  reading if you like medical-thrillers or if you enjoy reading Robin Cook.  But, if you haven't read Cook yet, don't start with that one. Take books  like CHROMOSOME 6 - his best! - or CONTAGION. They are much better than  VECTOR, I assure you. And also read the books by Michael Palmer. Another  adorable medical-thriller author.<br />Marco Aurelio - contact:  deankoontzfan@hotmail.com	2000-06-17

But when I started reading LIGHTNING, my concept of real entertainment  changed from one day to the other. I suddenly knew that I was missing the  best author of this world. And I'm not kidding here. <br />         Dean knows  exactly how to make you so jumpy all the time that you almost feel you are  there with all the characters. And all this with very powerful phrases  that, compared to the writing of the others famous authors, is a triumph.  And that's what Dean Koontz works on LIGHTNING: full emotions, horror,  adventure, action - mixed in the best way of writing ever: his own. If you  haven't read this book, you can't imagine what you're missing. If you  already read this book and is here reading this just wondering, you know  what I'm talking about and certainly agrees with me.

When I was wondering on the various bookshelves on my local  bookstore, my eyes stop at a book called THE TOMB, by F. Paul Wilson! I  bought it and sometime after, read it.<br />         First, the plot is very  well written. I like authors that, besides the real plot, give us a  &quot;second&quot; plot, like telling us the particular life of the main  character, or giving two problems to be solved instead of only one. That's  what happens here: Repairman Jack have to find a stolen necklace (read the  book and you will see that it's not just a common necklace like the ones of  fake gold you give to your girlfriend) have to help the family of the love  of his life and also, he has to change the idea of who he really is that  his girlfriend has of him, giving to the reader a very nice insight into  every character's life. It's a real nice book, a fast-paced must-read for  the lovers of this genre. The only problem is that the author tells  everything about everyone's life but Jack, who is almost even undescribed.  The rest is just amazing. <br />Marco Aurelio	2000-06-17

Scott Turow is one of those rare authors that knows how to handle the craft of writing perfectly well. More than just a good plot,  Scott Turow's legal thrillers books have very well developed characters.  All of his characteres are completely flawless. But not to the meaning that  they are perfect human beings - much to the contrary, what's interesting is  that the good people are not that good and that the bad have often more to  be discovered about than you think they have - , but that his characters  invariably are deep people. They have self-wish and complex ideas and  thoughts. That's what makes Scott Turow's characters differents of the #1  legal thriller author John Grisham - and I still wonder why he is so  famous, since his books are nothing more than caricatures and books  outlines or wanna-be-books. The sum of good plot and wonderful characters  couldn't result in anything different than an excellent book. And that's  what Scott writes: excellent and entertaining books that you read and feel  satisfied and glad for having done it. <br />         I'd highly recommend  another wonderful legal thriller author: Lisa Scottoline.

After reading ROSEMARY'S BABY, some years ago, I was surprised to see at my local bookstore this sequel to the worldwide famous Rosemary's tale. I enjoyed a lot the first book and was curious about the second one. It was  no surprise to me that the sequel was a good book. Ira Levin is really a  wonderful author. He carrys on a plot full of twists and enigmas. You're  always mesmerized by the facts he presents to the reader and how he  develops all of them. What I didn't like in this book was the ending. If  what Ira wanted by writing this book was destroy all the mystic around  Rosemary's story, he made it. Can you believe that [in the next phrase I'm  gonna tell the book's ENDING] what Rosemary had was just a dream?  The  whole book is nothing more than that.<br />         Anyway, I still adore Ira  Levin's writing. He's one of the best writers of his genre (to me, he is a  master and one of the founders of the contemporary horror style) and read  his books (why didn't he write more?) is always a pleasure. If you like  horror books you won't be disappointed with that one. Although it's not  what I'd call a perfect book, it's still worth reading. As I said, Ira's  books are always a good reading. Try one of them and you'll surely agree  with me.        <br />Marco Aurelio	2000-05-28

The movie is very good, the book is much, much superior. The author, Andrew Neiderman, is also the ghost-writer of deceased V.C. Andrews, but his writing under his own name  is much better than with hers in my opinion. Everytime I read a book by  Andrew Neiderman I am always shocked by the way his characters are  developed, and how he are always surprised by their atittudes. <br />          More to his credit, I'd say that Andrew has one of the most incredible  minds. None of his books are similar to others, and his crazy mind is  always working on an intelligent thing.<br />         THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is  just a display. It's the kind of book you read in only one seat. Believe  me, Andrew is good. And this book is just wonderful.<br />Marco Aurelio	2000-05-28

His writing is similar to PatriciaCornwell's, but he's much, much better. When I read THE POET, some years ago, I said to myself: Such an very well-written book! But when I read BLOOD WORK, I found a book that it's so good as the other one. Things are always happening in a kaleidoscopical speed. Things just happen so fast! And the plot is also so cool!<br /> In order not to spoil the plot, in a few words, BLOOD WORK tells the story of policeman who's going to retire because of a heart surgeon. In fact, he's in a leave because of his heart problem. But before he is able to do so, a case &quot;calls&quot; him and he finds himself involved in a story that you will love to read. <br /> Michael Connelly's favorite books are ANGEL'S FLIGHT and THE LAST COYOTE. I don't have AF, and personally, THE LAST COYOTE is far behind THE POET and BLOOD WORK, my favorite ones. Anyway, I prefer the ones 'without' his famous detective Harry Bosch. If you like detective stories full of twists and action, you won't be disappointed with that one. The whole book is incredible and you never get tired of the reading. Try it and see exactly what I mean.<br />Marco Aurelio	2000-05-28

That was the first book by Danielle Steel I read, and one that I'll remember until the day I die, since his influence in me was so huge.<br />         The story of Grace Adams is wonderful from beginning to end. You cry,  you laugh, you be afraid... but most important, you FEEL. It seems that you  are there with her, suffering with her when she has problems and  celebrating with her when she wins. But what's really interesting is the  suspense of the book. It never stops. When Grace is escaping from a  problem, another one comes and grab her... until she finds herself in love.  But you will see that love doesn't means end of problems, much to the  contrary, that they are only beginning. <br />         Since I read MALICE, I  could never forget Danielle Steel. I discovered that she's not an author  only for women. Through her books I discovered all kinds of emotion, good  or bad, but everytime I finish reading one of her books, one thing is  certain: the sensation of having read another excelent piece of writing.  Long life to Danielle Steel! She really deserves all her success she has.  Most of her books are unforgetable. MALICE is one of them. Get emotional  you too through this book. You'll be another one to find this book one of  her best!<br />Marco Aurelio	2000-05-28

So  why didn't you rate this book 5 stars instead of 4? The answer is: Mr.  Hailey's books are wonderful, but he wrote one or two dull lines. So...           As for the case of STRONG MEDICINE, the author wrote a book that has a  wonderful character and he develops them with an hability that I don't  usually see. He gives an insight on the remedy world and makes you  understand it completely well, what makes you be aware of how careful he  was as for researching. In a few words, Arthur Hailey is one of the best  authors out there, one of those that sometimes you hate for not writing as  much as you want to read, which to me usually means a ton of his books. And  Arthur have written only just a few, unfortunately. So, what you can do, is  read read and read his books and also enjoy him. You'll discover one of the  best writers you've ever read. Believe me.	2000-05-06

I was enjoying it but the fact that CHRISTINE is too thick was enough to pick a thinner book. But time passed and I knew I had time to read it. This happened almost three  years after the first time I tried it. And I finished it in only one week,  which, to my schedule, is something very fast.           I like to tell  friends that no one can ever be frightened by reading an horror book  because your mind expect terrible things to happen even if you don't know  about them counciously. But guess what!  While I was reading this book,  every car that appeared next to me frightened me. It seemed like a big  starving dinossaur. Creepy, isn't it? But I convinced myself that this is  what happens when you have in your hands a very well-written book.  CHRISTINE is a marvelous book. If you're a fan of the horror genre, this  book is a must-read.	2000-04-21

And some years ago, when I heard about the plagiarism she made on Nora Roberts books (and Nora's one of my favorites), I was  disgusted.           <br />         But the worlds keep moving, and then,  ILLUSIONS came to my hands and I started to read it. And believe me, I  loved this book. I couldn't believe that it was plagiarism, and later I  knew it wasn't. Janet has a very nice sense of humor, she made up adorable  characters on this book and a very nice plot that kept me reading during  the whole night. It's the kind of book that sometimes it's not so  interesting but that is never boring. I loved this book and I'd highly  recommend it  for fans of this genre. Janet is a very good writer.	2000-04-01

I used to think that all of them were boring and too complicated. This changed when I read that book. THE HOLCROFT COVENANT has  a very interesting plot that the reader is able to understand without much  problems. I'm not saying here that the plot is not intricated. It really  is! But Robert Ludlum does it so wonderfully that the reader goes on  reading without notice if it's morning or night. He's the best spy book  I've ever read, I say this without hesitation. Frederick Forsyth is another  good author, but Robert Ludlum is much, so much better. I became addicted  to Robert's books when I read that one. Now I love this kind of book to  death and would really love to have more and more books by Mr. Ludlum on  the following years, God willing. If you don't like much this genre, try  this book and start to enjoy it. If you're already a fan of spy books, THE  HOLCROFT COVENANT is a must-read, I assure you. Long writing life to Mr.  Robert Ludlum! He's just the best on his craft! Try him and you won't be  dissapointed.	2000-03-25

Obviously, she really knows how to do the thing she does, she criated her own style out of nothing and she has more than  just &quot;a couple of good books&quot;. Patricia Cornwell is famous and  has an intriguing life that would give to the readers a very nice  biography. <br />                   BODY OF EVIDENCE is the best Kay Scarpetta  book I've read till now. No other book by Patricia Cornwell moved me so  much and gave me such pleasure. It's modern and it has also very nicely  written characters that you'll love. And a wonderful plot, for sure. You  won't be disappointed if you read that book. It's really worthwhile. One of  those rare books by Patricia Cornwell that you buy and don't regret for  doing it.	2000-03-07

Much to the contrary, I used to hate them, because in my opinion, Joy Fielding is much better than MHC. And I still think that way. Yes, to me, Joy Fielding IS a lot better than Mary Higgins  Clark. But now I discovered that Mary is not so terrible as I used to  think. I have bought some of her books and started to read LOVES MUSIC,  LOVES TO DANCE some days ago. At first I perceived the huge influence that  Agatha Christie has made on MHC's writing. Very similar, though MHC writes  in a more contemporary style. This book is interesting, and the main  characters are these kind of people you'd love to have as friends of yours.  One of the things I don't like on MHC's books is that she fills the book  with lots of characters, and some readers sometimes may lose track of the  reading. It's not because the plot is intricated, but it has, in general,  too many unnecessary characters, a problem that Joy Fielding's books  doesn't have. The books by MHC are not unputdownnable, while the ones by  Joy Fielding are. But Mrs. Clark is still a good reading, a worthwhile  author. If you like the genre, you won't be dissapointed at all. It's the  kind of book that can be read by adults as well as by teens.<br />Marco  Aurelio	2000-03-07

Yes, I did enjoyed it... some sentences. The book is dull, the plot is boring and the characters are the most unreliable people you might deal with during your  life. Believe me, Grisham says by the middle of the book that people with  at least a little bit of culture speaks French in Brazil. He should makes  better on reseaching for his next book. People who has a bit of culture  here speaks English or Spanish. No French, for God's sake! I really can't  understand why John Grisham is the most successful author of the planet. I  see no reason for that. By the way, I do. Grisham has something called  &quot;marketing&quot;. During 24 hours a day you see the word GRISHAM  throbing in your head, because all the communication means are saying his  name, for you to buy his books. People turn his books into movies with  famous people. Sellers are instructed to say his books are interesting.  They aren't even readable! The problem is: people are so blind that buy  everything that media tells you to buy. There are so better authors on the  genre out there and people just don't see this. But if he's so famous, he  might have something good to offer. Yes, he does. THE TESTAMENT is really  an interesting book. But he's not the God in paper people want him to be.  His books are just common ones. Nothing special and easily forgetable.	2000-02-20

By this time, I haven't read anything by this writing team, I didn't read it, because I thought that POT OF GOLD seemed more interesting. And when I  started reading it, the book really gripped me. It's not to say that it is  a marvelous book, but it's the kind of reading you seek for when you arrive  at home looking for something to forget the world you live and all you want  is a light, soft reading. The plot is great fun, the main characters are  nice guys and when you finish reading it, you feel much better looking for  something else by this author. The only problem is the ending. Not  satisfatory to my point-of-view. Though some friends of mine liked it. I  did, but it could be better.

It's not the plot. It's not the way he writes. What I like in his books is the reading. I only like his books when I get  the sensation of work done. And that feeling I only get when I finish his  books. Yes, because his characters just don't seem real to me as characters  of books by others authors. Much to the contrary, they are in general  caricatures to me. But the whole thing is good.          As for the case of  THE WEB, it is a nice book, if compared to the old Kellerman standard. The  plot is full of mysterious characters, that you love to hate. Alex's  &quot;wife&quot;, Robin, has a bigger place in this book, and yes, believe  me!, she speaks!  On the older books by Mr. Kellerman, I was used to  think: Alex is dating a woman that's still learning to talk. Robin almost  didn't say a word, only short sentences. It's good to see that she has her  own thoughts and opinions and is also a woman of good sense of humor. You  might ask: why so many praises and only three stars? Two answers: I really  am not the kind of person who loves a book and start to tell everyone to  read it. I don't raise a book to the sky only because I liked it - with  rare exceptions - . Every plot has its problems. THE WEB is just a good  book. Nothing that another good writer couldn't write. But I have to say,  Mr. Kellerman has done a nice work with that one.	2000-02-19

Yes, he does. The problem is that he's too much worried about research. I'm not saying that an author who's writing about a subject he/she doesn't dominate  shouldn't research about it. But Michael Crichton is so worried about it  that his books sometimes seem to be written only to those people who  understand about it. And instead of a good entertainment, we have in our  hands an instructions guide. That's exactly what happens to AIRFRAME.

I wouldn't say that his imagination is not the same as it was once. No. I'd never do such a thing. What I'd say is that Sidney, at almost 83 years old, is like some authors  that don't write more because they want to keep standards. Sidney Sheldon  loves to say on interviews that he only publishes one book every two years  to keep his standards. And I think that that's what ruining him. Why can't  he write one or more books every year, like almost everyone else? He says  also that he can do it. He just doesn't.          When it comes to the TELL  ME YOUR DREAMS case, this just gets more clear. The plot is ridiculous, the  main characters are just absurds and by the end your wish is to tear the  book in a million pieces. I'm probably exagerating things a little, but  what I mean is that buy this book is not worthwhile, except you're a huge  Sidney Sheldon's fan, which is my case.           Getting closer to the  point: if Mr. Sheldon started to write more books per year, certainly like  two and two results in four his books would start to be one more  diferentiated to the other, and as a consequence, he would learn the craft  again and write wonderful books as he did in the past. Unless he's doing  like some authors that are writing books to be published after their death,  something I sometimes wonder... But if he's not, what I'd say is: please  Mr. Sheldon, publish books more often and be again what you once was,  because write books like the terrible TELL ME YOUR DREAMS is not fair with  your readers.	2000-02-05

THE PREDATORS is the  kind of book you should read on a Sunday afternoon, when you have time to  enjoy yourself and have nothing much else to do except have fun.

And I doubt if I'll live to read a better one.          What touched me in this book was not the horror itself. What makes this  book a must-read &amp; re-re-read is the plot along with the characters.  That's the most human book of Stephen King, the one where he could tell the  world &quot;I'm one of the best writers of this planet!&quot;. And yes, he  really is. If you pay attention to the inner feelings, the ones that are  not described in the book but the ones the author makes the reader wonder  about, you'll face feelings, emotions and people that are inside us all,  but that we rarely show to the world outside because the mankind lost the  capacity to move, the capacity of be touched by things, of letting your  heart cry... That's what Stephen King works in here: the true emotions, the  feeling of losing and don't knowing how to go on without the ones that  go... Things like that.

I was bored of books of suspense and terror, so I wanted something different. But after reading twelve books by Mrs. Steel in only one year, I got stuck by  the time (nowadays she's still my favorite author on this genre). Couldn't  go beyond. So I bought VOICES IN SUMMER, by Rosamunde Pilcher. Here in  Brazil she's usually a huge success among women, reason that I can't  understand. She's so so, not as excellent as many of her fellow writers.            But I liked that book, an a couple of others by this author, because  they're simple and sensitive. They touch on a very old and beautiful  feeling: the Human heart. Rosamunde Pilcher make up lovely characters. In  this book specificaly, I cried because of the death of a dog. The pet was  so real to me that I fought against tears not to cry for the death of an  imaginary animal, since I didn't cry even when my real one died. But I did.  And this book, although simple, is beautiful. If you're into this kind of  books, read it. You won't be disappointed.	2000-02-05

When they released TOXIN in Portuguese and invited Robin Cook to come to Brazil to autograph some copies on a large bookfair here, I thought to myself: this should be a great book. But I was wrong. Very wrong. Soon, the  book turned to be ridiculous. The main character was a very nervous guy,  losing his temper very easily. More than this, that was the most ridiculous  main character Robin Cook ever criated. Boring. Nervous. Presumptuous. He  has his motivations, true. But he acts as if the whole world is against  him.           So you're probably asking: so why do you still rate it three  stars? The answer: a Robin Cook book is always a Robin Cook book. I'll  never forget books like CHROMOSOME 6, MUTATION or CONTAGION. The character  is boring, and plot to me is character, 'cause if you don't like the  character, you'll probably don't like the book. But the story of the book  itself has its twists, it's interesting and filled with other supporting  interesting characters. Though all in all, it was a complete  disappointment.

This is because Joy Fielding was new to me (and soon I discovered she's  MUCH BETTER than another famous author that writes in her same genre, Mary  Higgins Clark), and MISSING PIECES was going to be my first try on her  books. I bought the book, but soon discovered that she was published in  Portuguese here in Brazil and tried first the ones in my language. When I  finished the one in Portuguese, I started MISSING PIECES, and oh my  Godness... it's completely wonderful. It's a book full of twists and it's  also funny and becomes more and more interesting as the story develops.  When I finished the book I was sad because it was over and I wanted it to  never end. That's the feeling that you have when finish Joy's books.  MISSING PIECES is no exception.<br />I'd also recommend: LIFE PENALTY, DON'T  CRY NOW and other books by Joy.	2000-01-13
