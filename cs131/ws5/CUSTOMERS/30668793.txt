Holmes, a serial killer in Chicago at the time.  The details told of the World Fair alone are quite interesting but if that seems a bit boring to you, trust me - this book is not boring.  The tale of the serial killer will keep you reading.  His crimes are shocking and horrifying, and even more shocking and horrifying is how long he continued to get away with them before being caught!  This book is perfect for anyone interested in U.S. history, Chicago history, or true crime.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-08

That said, if you are looking for good chick-lit, you should buy this book.  You may not relate to Andrea Sachs, the main character, but you WILL want to find out what Miranda Priestly, Andrea's boss, is going to do next.  I have no interest in fashion or the fashion world but I found this book to be enjoyable nonetheless.   <br />	2005-07-08
US	30668793	RF2ZRFC1CB05W	1400062314	9571448	Prep: A Novel	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Pretty good	\\"Prep\\" is the story of Lee Fiora, who flips through the catalog for Ault, a fancy boarding school in Massachusetts, and becomes enamored witht he idea of going to high school there.  Her family lives in South Bend, Indiana, and doesn't have much money so they don't think it's possible but Lee is fortunate enough to get a scholarship.  The book is separated into four sections based on each year Lee is at Ault.  The school turns out not to be quite what she expected and she finds it difficult to make friends there.  She feels like an outcast but she later comes to realize that it was her own feelings of inadequacy that held her back from reaching out.  While prep school is a world I haven't experienced, I found myself being able to relate to Lee at times based on the difficulty of starting out at a new place.  The feelings and emotions portrayed in the book are dead on.  This isn't the best coming of age book out there, but I did find myself wanting to keep reading to find out what would happen next.   <br />	2005-07-08

The book focuses on the death of her brother and how it impacted herself and her family.  She and Roy were always close and she was devastated by losing him.  While this book is filled with grief, it's not just a sad story.  It's also a coming of age story based on Smith's years at Mercy High School in Rochester, NY.  Despite the sadness, there are some very funny moments and I found myself laughing out loud numerous times.   <br /> <br />	2005-07-08

The boys must write their answers on the ground with sticks because paper had not yet been invented.  Their teacher punishes them by writing notes to their parents on their hands and instructing them to hold them up to keep them dry.  The boys are embarrassed when the entire village sees them walking home this way and they try to think of a way to invent something for the teacher to write on.  They succeed and the first paper is invented.  The book also contains an author's note about the true history of paper in China, and a recipe for homemade paper.  I would recommend sharing this book with children ages 6 through 9.  The simple story provides them with information about an everyday object they may be curious about.  Additionally, children in this age group are beginning to assert themselves and take pride in their accomplishments, and they will enjoy the initiative shown by the characters in the story.  I would use this book in a school setting with an extension about papermaking, showing the children how to make paper using the recipe in the book.  The unique illustrations, created with bright colors and outlined in black, have a stained-glass quality to them and fit well with the book's setting in ancient China.	2005-07-07
US	30668793	R2I5YGM5PRB8Q8	0440414806	159975375	Holes	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Excellent!!!!	Holes tells the story of what happens when Stanley Yelnats gets sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention center in the middle of a desert-like area in Texas.  Stanley is innocent of the crime for which he was convicted and he blames his conviction on a curse that was put on his family years before.  The boys at the camp are forced to dig holes all day every day in search of something that the evil camp warden wants to find.  Stanley becomes friends with Zero, another camper/prisoner, and when Zero escapes, Stanley runs away from camp to save him.  They work together to survive the Texas heat and stop the warden.       This book would be appropriate for ages 10 through 12 (however, older teens and adults will also love it).  Children in this age group enjoy tales of survival and will be inspired by Stanley's quest to save Zero and escape Camp Green Lake.  They are also beginning to tackle more difficult plots and will be able to appreciate the twists and turns Sachar provides.  In addition, at this age, kids have developed a sense of justice and will sympathize with Stanley's problems and feelings.  I would recommend using this book in any setting.  It could be used in a school for discussions about justice and perseverance but many children would enjoy reading it simply for enjoyment.	2005-07-07

In the first story, \\"What Will Little Bear Wear?,\\" Little Bear's mother helps him find something to wear to keep him warm outside in the snow.  In \\"Birthday Soup,\\" Little Bear thinks his mother has forgotten his birthday and decides to make birthday soup for his friends.  As they sit down to eat their soup, Mother Bear comes in with a birthday cake and tells him that she did not forget his birthday, and never will.  \\"Little Bear Goes to the Moon,\\" features Little Bear going on a pretend trip to the moon wearing his new space helmet.  Mother Bear has lunch waiting for him when he returns.  In the last story, \\"Little Bear's Wish,\\" Mother Bear tells Little Bear a bedtime story about all of the adventures he has had, providing a nice culmination to the book.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for ages 3 through 7.  Children this age will easily identify with Little Bear's adventures and emotions.  They will also enjoy the personification of the animals in the book.  In addition, children longing for security will be reassured by the portrayal of Mother Bear's love for Little Bear.  This book would be appropriate for parents to read to their young children for enjoyment.  Older children who are learning to read will also enjoy the short, simple stories.  The simple illustrations throughout the book complement the text perfectly by highlighting Little Bear's adventures.  In addition, Maurice Sendak has done an amazing job of expressing the love between Little Bear and his mother with his endearing drawings.	2005-07-07

It tells the story of Kit Tyler, a 16-year-old girl who sails from Barbados to Connecticut after her grandfather passes away.  Kit travels to Connecticut to live with her aunt and her aunt's family, none of who have met her and who do not know that she is coming.  Connecticut was a Puritan community struggling for independence from England at this time and the culture shock is difficult for Kit, who grew up affluent and independent.  The townspeople are not very welcoming to her and some believe to fear that she is a witch because she is different from them.  Kit's troubles get worse when she becomes friends with an old Quaker woman people called the Witch of Blackbird Pond.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for ages 10 and up.  Most children have felt like they didn't fit in at some point and will be able to relate to Kit.  This book teaches children about tolerance, acceptance, and not being judgmental.  I would use this book in a school setting as part of a social studies curriculum.  It is appropriate for discussions about witch trials, Puritan history, and Connecticut history.  I would also recommend this book for pleasure reading.	2005-07-07
US	30668793	R3JUST9WZA1XE1	0694011088	454724842	Cow Moo Me (Harper Growing Tree)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Cute and silly	Cow Moo Me contains images of animals paired with text using a rhyming pattern to display the name of each animal and the sound the animal makes.  For example, an image of a bumblebee flying around flowers is paired with the text, \\"bee buzz honey, bee buzz zoom, bee buzz busy, bee buzz bloom.\\"  This book would be appropriate for infants ages newborn to 24 months.  The rhythmic patterns, bright colors, and familiar animals make this book ideal for this age group.  In addition, the rounded edges are very appropriate for young infants who like to explore books themselves.  I would recommend using this book in the library as part of a lapsit.  The artwork is made of bright, colorful collages.  The images are cute and silly, fitting well with the simple text.	2005-07-07

It tells the story of a king who wants to find out who is stealing his golden apples.  He directs each of his sons to keep watch overnight to catch the thief.  Only the youngest son is successful in discovering who is stealing the apples - the legendary Firebird - but he is unable to capture the beautiful bird.  The king becomes heartsick over his longing to see the bird and sends his sons out again to find it.  Each son is approached by a vixen and asked for food.  The older sons attempt to kill the vixen, but the youngest shares his food with her.  The vixen then offers to help him find the Firebird and leads him on a magical journey.  With the vixen's help, he is able to return home with a beautiful princess, a magnificent horse, and the legendary Firebird.  However, the youngest prince's brothers find him sleeping along the way and become jealous.  They kill him and return home with the treasures themselves.  The vixen again helps him, though, and he is brought back to life and returns home to reclaim his treasures.   <br /> <br />This book would be appropriate for children ages 10 and 11.  Children in this age group like stories of survival and would enjoy reading about the young prince's independence and perseverance.  They would also appreciate the complex fantasy plot of the story.  I would recommend that children read this book on their own for enjoyment.  The beautiful watercolor illustrations reflect the mythical quality of the story.  Drawings of golden apples wrapped around vines are used creatively to separate narrative sections.  However, while the artwork matches what is happening in the text overall, the pictures do not always line up properly to match the text on the page you are reading.	2005-07-07
US	30668793	RY6SPHDS9U4E0	1890817538	921270798	Patches Lost and Found	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Excellent for use in the classroom/LMC	Patches Lost and Found tells the story of Jenny and her pet guinea pig, Patches.  Jenny, who loves to draw, is assigned to write a story for school.  She's nervous about the assignment because she isn't very good at coming up with ideas for stories.  When she gets home from school that day, her mother tells her that Patches has escaped from his cage and is missing.  They put up posters around town and Jenny draws pictures showing all the things that might have happened to Patches.  Luckily, a neighbor finds Patches, but Jenny still hasn't written her story.  Later that day her Mom comes into her room and shows her that she can add words to her pictures of Patches to tell a story.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for ages 6 and 7.  Most children in this age group will be able to identify with being nervous about an assignment for school, and they will be reassured that Jenny was able to overcome her difficulties and succeed in writing the story.  There are a variety of ways this book could be shared with children in a school setting.  It could be read as part of a section on writing stories, with the children later drawing pictures and then writing stories to go along with them.  These stories could possibly be the children's own ideas about what could have happened to Patches.  Another idea would be to teach the children about guinea pigs, possibly having a real guinea pig in the classroom, and then follow the lesson with this story.  The artwork in the book was prepared digitally.  Jenny looks like she could be a character in a cartoon on Nickelodeon.  Children would find this very appealing.  Kids would also enjoy the pictures Jenny draws of Patches because they probably look similar to pictures they would draw themselves.  The artwork does a good job of telling the story, showing each picture Jenny draws along the way and then displaying Jenny's story about Patches with the pictures.	2005-07-07

I liked the idea of separating the plot into the different decades of the characters lives but I ended up feeling left hanging, wanting to know more, at the end of each section when it jumped ahead 10 years.  It was interesting to look at how life changed over time though - how the world changed and how the characters changed along with it.   <br /> <br />One major part of the story focuses on Michael and Pauline's daughter running away from home.  They find her years later in San Francisco with her young son, Pagan.  I think I would have enjoyed more development into these characters.  An offshoot of the book written from the perspective of Lindy would be interesting.	2005-07-07

The book begins by asking, \\"What does baby want?\\" and then pictures items, such as lollipops, a doll, and a teddy bear.  I would recommend this book for infants ages newborn to 24 months.  The round edges, bright colors, and depictions of familiar objects are ideal for this age group.  The book is simplistic and features only one word and one object on each page.  Young infants might not easily recognize some of the items but I think they will enjoy looking at the pictures and learning what they represent.  I would use this book in the library as part of a lapsit and bring in examples of the objects for the children to look at and touch.  The bright colors and simplistic paintings fit well with the simple text.  The childlike drawings would appeal to young children.	2005-07-07

Paul Michael is such a great narrator - he has this amazing ability to do all sorts of accents.  He definitely brings the listener into the story in a way that reading it yourself couldn't do.<br /><br />The story itself is also excellent.  I'm not generally a mystery/suspense fan but with all the buzz about this book I had to find out for myself and I was hooked from the beginning.  It's a bit long for an audiobook but it's worth it.  Just make sure you get the unabridged version so you don't miss out on anything!  However, take note that once you start listening you won't be able to stop!	2005-07-07

The verses are displayed in their native language as well as in English.  The author notes in the introduction that she has created phonetic translations of the words in languages that are not written in Roman alphabet letters to enable readers to \\"hear\\" how the words should sound.   <br /> <br />This book would be appropriate for children ages 6 and 7.  Children in this age group crave security and will enjoy the family rituals in this book.  They will also like seeing this custom across cultures.  I would recommend that these poems be read aloud to children before naptime.  The illustrations for each poem were drawn by artists from the country in which the poem originated.  The drawings accurately reflect the cultures they represent.  The artwork is unique in that the techniques vary throughout the book from poem to poem.	2005-07-07

The weather in Chewandswallow came at breakfast, lunch, and dinnertime and the people in the town ate what the weather served.  It would rain beverages and snow foods to eat.  Life in the town was wonderful until the weather suddenly changed and large portions of unappealing foods started taking over the town.  The people are forced to abandon Chewandswallow and find a town where they can buy food at the supermarket instead.   <br /> <br />This book would be appropriate for children ages 6 and 7.  Children in this age group are developing a sense of humor and would enjoy the silliness of this story.  I would recommend using this book for a storytime program.  The book begins with simple black-and-white illustrations, some with color added.  The images of food falling from the sky, a giant Jell-o off in the distance, and a tomato tornado are perfect for the text because they demonstrate the ideas in the story for children.	2005-07-07

Each spread shows Kipper with a different object on each page that is opposite to the object on the other side of the spread.  For example, in one spread Kipper is shown on the left page peeking around a clothes hamper with the text, \\"Out.\\"  On the right page he is shown inside the hamper with the text, \\"In.\\"  The simple drawings and minimal text make this book appropriate for toddlers.  The focus on opposites is ideal for teaching toddlers the concept of what opposites are.  I would recommend using this book in the library for a lapsit.  The children could participate by identifying what the objects pictured are and what \\"opposite\\" they represent.  The watercolor drawings represent the text in a simple way with a plain white background.  The images of the cute puppy would be appealing to toddlers.	2005-07-07

Chocolate: Riches from the Rainforest tells the story of chocolate.  The book begins by discussing where chocolate comes from and who discovered it.  It goes on to describe how the ancient Maya and Aztecs drank chocolate regularly and offered it to their gods, and how the Spanish added sugar to chocolate to give it the sweet taste.  The book also describes how chocolate making has changed over time and how it is made today.  In addition, the book includes a glossary of terms used in the book and an author's note about some of the things he learned while writing the book.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for ages 10 and 11.  Children these ages will enjoy learning about the history of chocolate.  I do not feel that this book would be appropriate for younger children due to the discussions of human sacrifices and slavery.  I would recommend using this book during the summer as part of a fun segment on chocolate.  Having chocolate available for the kids to eat would be ideal because it is difficult to get through this book without craving it. The book is filled with wonderful photographs and illustrations.  These pictures add to the story by showing children the plant that chocolate comes from and some of the items that the Maya and Aztecs used to make and consume chocolate.  There are also step-by-step photographs detailing how chocolate is made today.	2005-07-07

Christopher, the main character, is a fifteen year old autistic boy who embarks on a quest to find out who murdered his neighbor's dog.

At her new school, her teacher decides to call her Mary because there are already two girls named Mar&iacute;a in the class.  Mar&iacute;a Isabel does not want to be called Mary but she doesn't know how to tell her teacher.  She consistently fails to respond when the teacher calls on her in class because she doesn't recognize Mary as her name.  This leads to the teacher assuming that she does not want to participate in the school's Winter Pageant.  When the teacher has the students write an essay titled, My Greatest Wish, Mar&iacute;a Isabel gets her chance to say how she feels.<br /><br />This book would be appropriate for ages 8 and 9.  Children in this age group are beginning to develop empathy for others, and an understanding of right and wrong.  Most children will be able to relate to facing a problem and not knowing what to do about it.  I would use this book for a read-aloud in a school setting as part of a discussion about cultural sensitivity and awareness.  I would also recommend it to kids to read for enjoyment.<br /><br />The artwork consists of black and white pencil or charcoal drawings placed sporadically throughout the text.  The drawings are placed consistently with the text that they refer to and they are culturally accurate.  The illustrator also added elements of Mar&iacute;a Isabel's thoughts into many of the pictures.  For example, when Mar&iacute;a Isabel is reading Charlotte's Web and feeling as if she is caught her own spider's web, there is a drawing of her in bed reading with shadows of a spider's web on the wall behind her.	2005-07-07

For example, The Princess and the Pea is retold as The Princess and the Bowling Ball and The Gingerbread Man is retold as The Stinky Cheese Man.  I particularly enjoyed the retelling of Chicken Little as Chicken Licken, in which the sky isn't falling, but the table of contents is, and the retelling of The Ugly Duckling as The Really Ugly Duckling, in which the duckling grows up to be an ugly duck rather than a swan.  The tongue in cheek humor is as fun for adults to read as it is for children.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for ages 8 through 11.  Children in this age group will enjoy the silly humor and the unique type of fantasy the stories provide.  I would share this book by reading the original fairy tales to the children first and then this book and maybe some other twisted fairy tale books.  This would be valuable because the children would have a better understanding of the humor if they have heard the original fairy tales.  Following this I would have the children create their own versions of the fairy tales.  The illustrations are as unique and zany as the text.  Lane Smith has created interesting images that represent the stories.  The varying type fonts and the twists on the table of contents and the endpapers add to the chaos to create a truly original reading experience.	2005-07-07

However, Al becomes a hero when he uses his pasta to catch some thieves breaking into a store, rescue two boys from a burning building, help some people cross a flooded street, and save the pizza delivery truck driver when she crashes the truck.  The town loves him and starts buying pasta again, saving the family business.  The last page of the book features a description of how pasta is made and how to cook it properly.   <br /> <br />This book would be appropriate for ages 6 and 7.  Children in this age group will enjoy the fantasy quality of this book and will laugh at the silliness of the story and pictures.  I would recommend using this book in a school setting with an extension about pasta.  The children could see and feel the different types of pasta and maybe use them to create art projects, like macaroni necklaces, pictures, or sculptures.  The zany watercolor illustrations fit the text perfectly.  The title of the book is drawn with pasta noodles, and other small details continue the pasta theme, such as the clock with a fork and a spoon for hands and numbers made out of noodles.

Alta played baseball from the time she was a little girl, and in 1907, at the age of 17, she proved that girls could play baseball when she became the pitcher of the semipro all-male team, the Vermillion Independents.  The author's note tells readers some details about Alta's life and the final page of the book outlines highlights of women in baseball from 1866 to 2001.   <br /> <br />This book would be appropriate for children ages 8 and 9.  Children in this age group are beginning to develop an interest in history and biographies, as well as an interest in sports books, and they will enjoy hearing a story about this element of the history of baseball.  I would read this book to children in a school setting as part of a section either on women's history, the history of women in baseball, or general baseball history. The illustrations, rendered in acrylic paint, are simple but enjoyable.  They show children the types of outfits people would wear to play baseball almost a century ago.  Each stage of the story is marked with a bat and ball image displaying innings one through nine.  The endpapers feature drawings of the entire Vermillion Independents team.  The back cover of the book has an original photo of Alta Weiss playing baseball.  Children will enjoy being able to see this real image of the hero they are reading about.	2005-07-07

Children these ages enjoy making up stories to go along with wordless books.  Many of them also take pleasure in playing with building blocks and will enjoy the images of the blocks being built into various things.  In addition, the personification of the couple made out of wooden blocks will appeal to young children.  I recommend sharing this book with children for enjoyment.  The illustrations were prepared with black pen-and-ink line drawings and separate overlays for the colors.  The images do a wonderful job of telling the story without text.	2005-07-07

The first story begins with the birth of Despereaux, a very tiny mouse who everyone expects to die, and tells of how he falls in love with the beautiful human Princess Pea.  This leads to his being sent to the dungeon.  The next story tells of Roscuro, a rat with a love of light and a desire for soup.  Miggery Sow, a senseless little girl with a hearing problem who wishes to become a princess, is the focus of the third story.  The last story focuses on tying the characters and their dreams together.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for ages 8 through 11.  Children in this age group are developing a sense of empathy and will be able to accept the problems that the characters face in this book and feel concern for them.  They also appreciate imaginary tales and they will enjoy the adventures that the animals in the story face and relate to their dreams.  In addition, most children in this age range will be able to understand the twists and turns of the story.  This book would be appropriate for children to read for enjoyment.  The pencil illustrations endear Despereaux to readers with images of his small size and huge ears.  In addition, the border art at the beginning of each of the four stories appropriately ties in elements of the story with a beautiful design.  The elegant book jacket also reflects the dramatic nature of the story.	2005-07-07

Oy faces many difficulties trying to fit in at school.  To begin with, her teacher calls her Olivia, her American name, instead of Oy.  In addition, a boy in her class, Frankie, keeps saying that she is Chinese and the many Mexican-American students at the school begin to call her Chinita (Spanish for little Chinese).  The situation becomes worse when Liliandra, the most popular girl in class, sees a picture of Oy in a beautiful Thai dress and offers her membership into her exclusive club if she brings the dress to school for her to try on.   <br /> <br />This book is appropriate for ages 8 and 9.  Children in this age range will be able to relate to the issues the book deals with, such as peer pressure and wanting to fit in.  They are also beginning to develop empathy for others, and will show concern for Oy's feelings.  I would use this book as a read-aloud in a school setting as part of a discussion about cultural awareness and appreciating differences.  I would also recommend this book for pleasure reading.	2005-07-07

She goes for a walk in the woods and discovers Jesse Tuck drinking from a spring.  When she tries to take a drink herself, Jesse is forced to tell her that the spring provides eternal life to anyone who drinks from it, and that he is actually over one hundred years old.  The Tuck family then kidnaps Winnie to explain to her the importance of not telling anyone about this spring for fear that people would drink from it without understanding the consequences.  Winnie begins to love the Tucks and faces the difficult decisions of whether to help them and whether to drink form the spring herself.<br /><br />This book would be appropriate for ages 10 and 11.  Children in this age group are beginning to question their relationship with their family and will be able to identify with Winnie's desire for change and independence.  They are also becoming more analytical and will be able to appreciate the book's portrayal of life and death and the questions set forth about whether everlasting life would be a blessing or a hindrance.  I would recommend that children read this book for enjoyment.	2005-07-07

Books	3	0	0	N	N	May not hold every reader's interest	Why Does the Cat Do That? is a combination fiction and nonfiction picture book.  Bob, who has never had a cat and is unfamiliar with cat behavior, is housesitting for the Fosters and taking care of their cat, Molly.  Each time Bob interacts with Molly and comments on her behavior, the book follows with a section explaining the cat's behavior and relating it to her ancestor cats of the wild.  For example, Bob observes Molly clawing the door frame rather than her scratching post and then the book goes on to explain why a cat scratches an object.  The transition back and forth from fiction to nonfiction is a creative way to interest children in nonfiction books, but this format can be confusing at times and the book might not easily hold everyone's interest.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for ages 6 through 9.  Children in this age group will enjoy learning more about a subject they may be familiar with already.  I would share this book with children after a lesson about house cats and their ancestors.  The illustrations, which were created with watercolor and ink on Fabriano hot-pressed paper, do a wonderful job of adding a visual element to the text.  While plain, the images of the cats are realistic and demonstrate the natural beauty of cats.	2005-07-07

I love Joyce Carol Oates and believe she is an amazing writer.  I also think this book is exceptionally well-written.  However, the plot fell short with me.  There are some shocking events in this novel and it is somewhat suspenseful but overall I found the characters to be annoying and didn't really care what happened to them. In addition, the ending did not live up to my expectations.  Living in Upstate NY, I did enjoy reading Oates' history of Niagara Falls, NY and the famous Love Canal scandal.   <br /> <br />	2005-07-07

It tells the story of Ma'antah, a brilliant child who the villagers call \\"Sense Pass King\\" because she has more sense than even the king.  The king learns of this and becomes angry.  He devises many plans to have Ma'antah killed, but she keeps outwitting him.  Eventually, the villagers drive the king out of the village and make Ma'antah their queen.  An author's note on the last page explains that in the traditional tale, Sense Pass King is a little boy.  The author chose to make Sense Pass King a girl in this retelling because there are not enough stories about brave and clever girls.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for children ages 6 through 9.  Children in this age group who are beginning to assert themselves will enjoy reading about Ma'antah outwitting the king.  They are also developing a sense of right and wrong and will be happy that the book's ending is just.  I would use this book as part of a storytime program with other books of African folk tales.  The beautiful acrylic paintings  <br />add to the text by showing children detailed images of a traditional West African village, such as straw huts, animals, and traditional dress and jewelry.   <br />	2005-07-07

As the gingerbread boy does in the original story, the gingerbread baby runs away and is chased through the town by the townspeople and animals.  However, in this version, instead of the Gingerbread Baby being eaten by a fox, Matti stays home baking a gingerbread house for the Gingerbread Baby to run into.  Children will enjoy lifting the flap on the last page and seeing the Gingerbread Baby inside his house.  This book would be appropriate for children ages 5 through 8.  Children in this age group enjoy hearing make-believe stories involving talking animals or toys or, in this case, talking cookies!  I think young children especially will be happy that in this version the Gingerbread Baby does not get eaten by the fox in the end.  I recommend sharing this story with children for enjoyment at Christmastime.    Jan Brett's illustrations are beautiful and cover every inch of the page.  The authenticity of the drawings of the Swiss village and the townspeople is stunning.  Each image is drawn with exquisite detail.  The illustrated borders on each page, which give the appearance of being made out of cookie dough and icing, picture additional scenes related to the events unfolding in the story inside Gingerbread Baby shaped cutouts.  The eye-catching endpapers round out the beauty of the book as a whole.	2005-07-07

As they watch the rioting from their window, the mother discusses candidly the details of what is happening with her son.  When their apartment building catches on fire, they must evacuate and move to a shelter for the night.  They are forced to interact with their neighbors who are of different races and they learn the importance of focusing on similarities instead of differences.  This book gives a good overview of what life was like for a child at this moment in history.  I would recommend it for ages 11 through 14.  The complex issues the story brings up about prejudice and racism would be appropriate for children in this age group who are beginning to analyze moral issues.  The book should be used in a school setting.  It would be appropriate to read the book as part of a discussion on racism or race riots.  The paintings in the book were made in acrylics on Arches watercolor paper.  The backgrounds, which are collages made up of objects related to the story, were created and photographed by the illustrator.  The artwork is unique and fits the text perfectly.  For example, when in the story the boy views people stealing cereal from the market, the background is a photograph of actual cereal, and when the boy views someone stealing clothes from the dry cleaners, the background is a photograph of clothing on hangers in plastic bags.	2005-07-07

Olivia is pictured on each page with various numbered items and a short description.  For example, the first page shows Olivia holding a beach ball and the text reads \\"1 one ball.\\"  The counting continues with \\"2 two bows,\\" \\"3 three pots of paints,\\" etc. up to the number ten.  The pictures are clever and appealing.   <br /> <br />I would recommend sharing this book with young toddlers.  The minimal text and simple drawings make this book appropriate for this age group.  In addition, the basic counting concept would be ideal for helping children learn to count, and children who are already familiar with Olivia will be happy to see her featured.  I would use this book in the library as a read-aloud and have the children participate by identifying the number of items on each page and what the items are.  It could be part of a larger program focused on either Olivia books, counting books, or other concept books (ex: colors, ABCs, opposites, etc.).  The drawings, which were created with charcoal and gouache, are simple black, white, and red illustrations.  The simplicity of the colors and illustrations fits well with the basic concept of the book.	2005-07-07

Tisa does not like Monday mornings because it's the day her mother braids her hair.  Every Monday she hides but her mother always finds her and struggles to brush through her knotted hair.  However, Tisa is happy when she sees the beautiful results.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for ages 6 and 7.  Children these ages are beginning to notice differences and this book will help children to accept those differences.  Many little girls who have suffered through the pain of getting their hair brushed will be able to relate to Tisa.  Seeing Tisa's family bond together will also reassure children looking for security in their family relationships.  I would recommend using this book with children learning to read.  The simple, rhyming text will be easily read and enjoyed by beginning readers.  The watercolor paintings are culturally accurate and complement the text.  The illustrator captures the warmth and emotions of Tisa and her family.	2005-07-07

The book looks at how after Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japanese warplanes, the United States became fearful of Japanese Americans.  The U.S. government forced thousands to leave their homes and move into relocation camps.  The quotations in the book by prisoners in the relocation camps help to describe what this experience was like. While the text in this book is sparse, the topic is one of importance that is not given enough attention.  The book also includes a timeline of the related events, a short dictionary of words used in the book, and instructions on how to make a Japanese Stone Garden.  <br /> <br />This book is appropriate for ages 10 and 11.  Children in this age group are developing an understanding of history and an interest in world issues.  They are also beginning to show concern for others and show empathy for those suffering from injustice.  I would use this book in a school setting as part of a discussion on World War II and the relocation camps.  The children could read other books on the subject and then discuss what life would be like and how they would feel if they were forced to move into a relocation ramp.  Black and white photographs of Japanese Americans in the camps provide children with an important visual element that will help them to understand that these events really happened.	2005-07-07

The short, clever poems describe snakes, alligators, lions, sharks, and more.  The book begins with \\"Always Be Kind to Animals,\\" which starts out sentimental but then shows the scary theme of the book:  \\"Always be kind to animals; Morning, noon and night; For animals have feeling too; And furthermore they bite!\\"  The scariest of the poems is \\"Strippers\\": \\"If you fall into a river that's full of Piranha; They'll strip off your flesh like you'd skin a banana; There's no time for screaming, there's no time for groans; In forty-five seconds you're nothing but bones.\\"   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for children ages 8 and 9.  Children this age will enjoy the images of the animals and the scary nature of the poems.  This book will provide an opportunity to encourage them to read poetry.  The large pictures make the book ideal to use for a read-aloud.  The colorful full-page illustrations were rendered in pastel on paper.  They give kids an amazing close-up view of the animals, with a drawing of a hippopotamus appearing to jump out of the page at the reader.  The shadow effects of the animals at nighttime add to the overall eerie nature of the book.	2005-07-07

She is unable to sell any and she is afraid that she will get a beating if she returns home with no money.  She crouches in a corner by a building and burns the matches to keep warm.  As she burns each match, she sees visions of a New Year's Eve dinner, a beautiful Christmas tree, and her late grandmother.  She burns all of the matches in an attempt to keep her grandmother with her and she is then carried up to heaven by her grandmother.  The little girl is found frozen to death the next morning with the pile of burned out matches.   <br /> <br />This book might be enjoyed by children ages 8 and 9 who are beginning to develop a sense of empathy and to question death. Parents might want to read this book with their children around the holidays to teach them the importance of thinking of others and appreciating what they have.  The concepts of poverty, child abuse, and death may be too disturbing for some children, however.  The dark quality of the black-ink drawings reflect the sadness of the story, while the limited color representing the little girl's visions highlights the small amount of joy the she was able to experience at the end of her life.  In addition, the straight lines of the European buildings and steps seem to symbolize the little girl's matchsticks.	2005-07-07

The boys are upset because the clubhouse is for boys only so they make signs that have mean sayings about the girls.  The girls get angry and beat up the boys until they run and hide.  However, then the girls realize that the youngest of them, Annie, is missing and they start crying.  Hearing this, the boys come out from hiding, and they all work together to find Annie.   <br /> <br />This book would be appropriate for ages 6 and 7.  The simple language is ideal for children developing reading skills.  In addition, children in this age group who are becoming curious about gender differences will enjoy hearing about how the boys and girls worked together in the end to overcome those differences.  I would recommend this book be read for enjoyment by children learning to read.  The simple drawings do a nice job of illustrating what is happening in the text.  The expressions on the children's faces are amusing and appropriately reflect the emotions of the characters.	2005-07-07

The book tells the story of Edward Warren, a 13-year-old boy who was the first person in America to ride in a hot air balloon.  The story is told from Edward's perspective, focusing on his life as an orphan and blacksmith's apprentice, and his dream to fly.  Peter Carnes, a tavern proprietor, had built many air balloons and sent them up for test flights, but he had not built up the courage to try flying in one himself.  He planned to exhibit the balloon in Baltimore on June 24, 1784, but when the day came, he feared that the balloon would not hold his weight.  Edward volunteered and made history.  The book contains an author's note describing the hot air balloon craze that began soon after the American Revolution.  The author also explains that all that is known about Edward is his name and age, and that she had to imagine the rest of the details of the story.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for ages 6 through 9.  Children in this age group are beginning to develop expanding interests and will enjoy learning the story of hot air balloons.  They are also beginning to develop independence, and will be inspired by the initiative and heroism shown by Edward.  This book will also give children developing an understanding of time concepts a feeling of what life was like in 18th Century America.  I would use this book in a school setting with students learning about this time period.  It would also be appropriate to use with children studying aviation history.  The oil paintings in the book highlight the events in the book as they occur.  The realistic paintings of the characters and land accurately reflect the setting.  In addition, the book's endpapers feature two newspaper articles written in 1874 about the actual events.	2005-07-07

The text goes through some of the activities a child would do when getting ready for bed and the photographs are of young children performing these tasks.  Some of the activities are putting away toys, having a bath, putting on pajamas, brushing teeth, using the potty, and reading a story.  The photographs highlight a variety of children, including children of different races, a developmentally delayed child, and a child being held by a parent of a different race.   <br /> <br />The bright colors and sparse text make this book appropriate for toddlers.  In addition, it's a board book with rounded edges, making it easy for young children to look at by themselves.  It shows children like them performing everyday tasks.  Consistency and routines are important for young children and this book focuses on a ritual that every child performs each night.  It also highlights the children's' accomplishments with sentences like \\"I can put on my pajamas and comb my hair all by myself.\\"  Also, toddlers need affection and this book includes multiple pictures of parents holding, hugging, and kissing their children.  This book should be read to children at bedtime by their parents or other caregivers.  The photographs are perfect for the text because they show the children performing the tasks that the text is describing.	2005-07-07

Juli fell hard (\\"flipped\\") for Bryce the first time they met.  Bryce spent the next 6 years trying to avoid her.  However, Bryce learns some tough lessons and realizes that things aren't always what they seem.  The story is told from the perspective of both Juli and Bryce, jumping back and forth from chapter to chapter.  What is truly unique is how Bryce will tell his version of what happened at a certain point in time and then Juli will tell her version.  This gives great insight into the characters and shows how important it is to hear both sides of a story.  While the book's premise is somewhat lighthearted, I was truly moved by the characters (particularly Juli) and life lessons in this book.  I would recommend it for ages 10 through 14 for pleasure reading.	2005-07-07

The diary was written in 1912 while Anne Elizabeth was growing up in New York City.  The book contains an Introduction with information about Anne Elizabeth's childhood and her love of drawing.  There are also sidebars featured throughout the book providing more information about things Anne Elizabeth mentions, such as life in the early 1900s, New York culture, events, and the role of women in society.  In addition, at the end of the diary entries there is a section titled, \\"What Happened Next?,\\" detailing Anne Elizabeth's adult life as an artist and her marriage to Edward Duffy, a Pulitzer Prize-winning political cartoonist.  Other features include a note from Anne Elizabeth's granddaughter, tips on keeping a diary, an index, and an author's note.   <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed this book until I read the author's note written by Kathleen Krull on the last page.  Krull indicates that because women weren't raised to show feelings during this time period, Anne Elizabeth did not reveal enough information about her feelings.  Krull remedied this by adding \\"interpretations, continuity, and emotion\\" based on interviews with her daughter and granddaughter.  I would have preferred that either the diary excerpts stay true to the original form or that this information would have been given in the introduction to the book.   <br /> <br />This book would be appropriate for ages 8 through 12.  Children in this age range who are interested in biographies and life in the past will enjoy reading about Anne Elizabeth's life growing up in the early twentieth century. The fact that she overcame the odds and became a successful artist will be inspiring to children with dreams and goals for their own future careers.  In addition, children these ages will be able to identify with Anne Elizabeth's difficulties in getting her family to understand her.  I would recommend that this book be used with students studying famous artists or life in the early twentieth century.  The book features photographs of Anne Elizabeth and her family, providing readers with an authentic glimpse of her life.  Original drawings from her diary are also included.  Although the book does not reproduce the original pages from her diary, the text is in a handwritten typeset, giving the book the feel of a real diary.   <br />	2005-07-07

His family is part of the Onondaga Nation and lacrosse is part of their heritage. The book begins by discussing the Onondaga Nation Territory and the six nations of the Iroquois.  It then describes the history of lacrosse and its significance to the Onondaga Nation.  It also provides some information about how to play the game, including how the field is set up, what positions there are, what equipment is needed, and the skills used.  The book mentions that women's lacrosse is somewhat different but does not go into details about the women's version of the game.  Also included are a description of how lacrosse sticks are made and a glossary of terms used in the book.   <br /> <br />I would recommend using this book for children ages 8 through 11.  Many children in this age group are interested in learning about other cultures and history.  In addition, sports books are popular in this age group.  The combination of these elements in this book make it appealing on different levels.  I would use this book during the summer as part of a discussion on lacrosse.  I would have lacrosse sticks available for the children to see and possibly include a guest speaker from one of the local college or professional lacrosse teams.  The photographs and illustrations give children a better understanding of the Iroquois, the Onondaga Nation Territory, and the game of lacrosse.	2005-07-07

I would use this book in a school setting.  The illustrations, which were made using gouache on watercolor paper, interpret the story appropriately.  However, while they may be appealing to children because of their bright colors and childlike quality, I feel that more traditional African illustrations and photographs would be more appropriate for the subject matter.
