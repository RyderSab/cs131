A step by step set of maps and guides demonstrate exactly where to go to encounter the remnants of the New Madrid sequence; even 200 years later, the earth still tells the tale. <br /> <br />A fabulous and unique reference guide for anyone interested in earthquakes - snap it up right away!	2005-06-06

Each chapter details the society that is about to be hit with disaster, describes the quake and damage, and how (or if) the society recovers.  From the demise of Sparta, to the fall from grace of the Roman Catholic church in Portugal, to the rise of San Francisco from the ashes, this book is an entertaining and informative read.  The unpredictable effects of these disasters is interesting and valuable knowledge, as future disasters can and will present some of the same issues.  I couldn't put it down!	2005-06-06

It is a riveting read of testimonies, interwoven with sociological and psychological theory, to explain how the survivors have made it through and coped with the memories, losses and experiences.  It is probably the largest collection of testimonies in one publication, and for students of psychology or sociology, it is a must-read. <br /> <br />The authors very plainly state in language that a layperson is comfortable the backgrounds and theories surrounding survivor personalities.  They address the survivors' reactions to the continued denial of the genocide by the Turkish government; the interesting repeated experience of Armenian children leaving Turkish homes for orphanages, and the path many survivors have taken to end up in the United States. <br /> <br />A good read, sometimes a difficult one due to the subject matter, but one that is important due to an event that is largely forgotten.	2005-06-06
US	50122388	RPVFVQSNRM7G	B0006CUQ1K	371533544	Terror at Tenerife	Books	3	10	13	N	N	A compelling tale, if heavy handed	Surprisingly, for its flaws, I read this book in basically one sitting.  The author, a survivor (remarkably) of the horrific collision of two 747s on the island of Tenerife, tells his story and others in this book.  He adds just the right amount of back story to put you in emotional touch with the individuals on the planes.   <br /> <br />The only drawback is the tendency to repeat himself from chapter to chapter.  That, and if you're put off by someone's testimony about their religion, then this book isn't for you.  The author weaves the story around his own Christianity and how he believes his faith led to his survival.  However, he also addresses the questions (at least, according to his beliefs) of where G-d is when disasters like these take place. <br /> <br />All in all, it was certainly enough to keep my attention and put it in my library.  A very unusual perspective, to say the least.	2005-06-06

I vaguely recall reading one of the first books in the series, but this one just popped.  I started reading and frankly, couldn't stop.   <br /> <br />The author winds an interesting story - a far-fetched one, with the addition of a reality TV show, but then again, the idea of a Meg trawling the waters of the Pacific is pretty far-fetched too.  Let's face it, the author needed a good reason for his characters to get into the water with this thing around, and a group of daredevils is a pretty easy sell for that! <br /> <br />He adds an interesting back story with the aging and nearly bankrupt main character, whose wife is drifting away from him, and very adeptly brings the characters around to their true selves.  I liked it a lot, it's a great easy read.	2005-06-06

Watching death all around her, it is amazing that she or anyone could garner the will to keep going with every new dawn. <br /> <br />If ever you search for a book that sums up the Holocaust, look no further.	2004-09-15

Hearing their sometimes stark retelling, as well as information from dead-heading crew who *know* what those sounds really are, presents an unusual and compelling read.  Macpherson does not dominate the text with commentary and instead lets those with first-hand knowledge tell the story.  Very well done and very readable, and will stick with you.	2004-09-15

Though the story of the nun's remains was interesting, it too got bogged down in what appeared to be a grab for suspense - that is, leaving details just beyond the reader's reach.   <br /> <br />It's certainly a very readable novel and as usual, the combination of facts about forensic recovery, and the on-again, off-again romantic life of Tempe, certainly hit the right balance.  If you're a fan of the series, pick it up - but if you're new to these books, start with a different one, like Fatal Voyage (one of my personal favorites).	2004-09-15

Using historical figures to develop a story around how both the media, Red Cross, and other governments acted while the Armenians were being massacred, a touching, terrible saga emerges. <br /> <br />There is much heart to be taken in the background, with the details of the many foreigners who attempted to give assistance, one way or another, to stem or stop these atrocities from continuing.  It is also refreshing to hear the stories of heroic citizens who stood in the face of power, knowing what it would likely cost them. <br /> <br />Who, after all, remembers the Armenians?  Thanks to Balakian, many more people worldwide will NEVER forget.	2004-09-15

Written in striking detail thanks to the increased parameters and quality of CVR/FDR recordings, Job takes the stuff of nightmare and soothes the reader, with the knowledge that the answer is always found at the end. <br /> <br />Written above the average reading level, Job does draw on his substantial experience and knowledge of the working of planes.  However, even the average traveler will be reassured by the competence, while sometimes surprised by the choices, of the flight crews in this book. <br /> <br />I would like to see Job take on some of the more messy cases of the present days - this series is a very even-handed review of accidents with no speculation or questioning conclusions.  I look forward, as always, to the next installment!	2004-08-04

McCullough, known for his exhaustive research, also writes in an upscale but conversational style that will have you losing yourself in his story.  Certainly if nothing else, one leaves this book with an incredible awe of the strength of character and reason that was Abigail Adams!   <br /> <br />McCullough gives accurate portrayals of the very complex issues and relationships of the time, and presents a truly wonderful book.	2004-08-04

Ms. Garrett presents some complex ideas about virology, microbes, and the science of disease investigation - but presents it in a reader-friendly way.  Her audience is exposed to what we see today with SARS, when we wonder what, exactly, the CDC and WHO are doing out there.  It describes them nearly in the terms of an NTSB go-team, which is a concept most aren't aware of.<br />Beyond the factual interest in diseases, Ms. Garrett also delves - quite successfully - into the policy arena.  She points out, better than anyone else I've read so far, how things we think don't matter to us in fact really do.  If you've ever skimmed through the world section of your news, thinking ah, what do I care, some third world people are diseased.  In this age of travel, urbanization, and other very simple things - it DOES potentially affect you.  There is a trickle down effect that is amazing to watch unfold, and Ms. Garrett does a wonderful job of taking readers, step by step, from one epidemic to another, until it dawns on the reader - this doesn't end the way we want it to.<br />I'd call it recommended reading for anyone interested in the subjects addressed, in foreign policy, in getting a better grasp of our world...in short, for everyone.	2003-05-14

That said, I'm not sure it detracts so much from the quality - the point comes through, and to discuss the minutia of politicking and health plans would have drowned the reader in prose outside the point of the book.<br />Now - to the story.  Like The Coming Plague, this book does a wonderful job of pointing out the science of disease, how diseases emerge and re-emerge, and why everyone needs to care, whether it's in your country or not.  I think this gives detail unavailable due to the mass of diseases covered in her first book; as a result, this one can do a more thorough job in getting the reader to understand the universal repurcussions of the decisions made on all levels about health care.  It will also make you start to care about those countries you usually ignore.<br />Again, I think everyone would benefit from reading this book.  It reads like a set of thrilling short stories, with the most compelling hook of all - they're true.	2003-05-14

He is able to convey some of the emotion and momentum from The Killer Angels, but does not do nearly as good a job in describing battle.<br />Further, his overwhelming use of ellipses to describe pauses in conversation may work in screenwriting, but they are tiresome in fiction.  He also insists on stringing long clauses after single subjects in a way that begins as efficient, but later makes for labored reading.	2003-01-08

The author is nothing short of brilliant.  He is able to paint a clear picture of the suffering and evil treatment that went on, both to himself and others.  It is a remarkably compelling story of survival that is written so cleanly and smoothly that it is difficult to put down.	2003-01-08

Particularly for someone with a limited knowledge of the Pacific theatre of WWII, it is an eye-opener for how similar atrocities went on at the hands of Axis powers.  The story is told with a seamless blend, describing the approach of the rescue forces and the long years of the prisoners, coming to a remarkable climax.<br />This author has a gift for making words become visible pictures.  His vivid descriptions give detail and the ability to feel very close to the realities suffered by these men.  It is a book that is compelling from start to finish, and which you won't want to put down.	2003-01-08

Shaara uses such vivid description, and his talent allows him to let the reader understand the truly agonizing decisions made on both sides of the war.  Although he ascribes his own words to the situation, the suggested text is very much in line with historical biographies of characters like Lee and Chamberlain.<br />Along those lines, the marvelous reviews of troop movements - and let's face it, military maneuvering isn't always the most lively reading - really make the battle come alive.  It is obvious by the close of this book why Lee's strategies are to this day taught in military academies.  This book is one of the first I recommend to anyone interested in the Civil War.	2003-01-08

Thayer does a great job at detailing crash sites and the remarkable actions of the NTSB.  The relationship with the female FBI agent adds an interesting dimension, without the typical tacked on love story feel, and certainly without the expected happy ending.<br />It is an easy read, and I was also baffled by the nearly complete inaccuracy of the description on the back cover (there is never any suggestion of pilot error).  However, if you can put aside the expectations of the story his publisher is advertising, this really is a great story.	2002-12-31

Extremely well written, this book offers both the specifics and the historical context of some of the century's most heinous crimes.  <br />Although I don't agree with the position that the author seems to promote throughout the book, that the United States should immediately jump into the fray when any crimes of this nature begin, I do think it's a viewpoint worth considering.  There are many times in history demonstrated quite thoroughly in this book that we stood by and did nothing for too long.  We can't stop all atrocities, but this book argues that we can do a lot more than we have so far.<br />I found this a truly fascinating evaluation of several important events that put even today's international conflicts into better perspective.  It's a long book, but worth every page.	2002-11-14

She has a wonderful sense of writing true to life forensic investigations as they overlap the true story line of her books.

This book is really well written and well crafted.  The story takes place in the context of real historical events that are only now being explored, and it lends such credibility to her work.  Her detailed knowledge of forensics shines through, but without overpowering the prose or the underlying stories.<br />The characters are well rounded, and it is easy to picture each of them as she writes.

This perspective makes it difficult for anyone to argue that the terrors of the Holocaust were simply created by Jews to evoke sympathy - this man saw what happened, and tells the story quite well.<br />Additionally, the book has a nice way of not weighing one group of victims over another.  It details each section of society targeted by Nazis, with a really quality depiction of the harm inflicted on the Soviet population.<br />It's an easy read, and one that I think everyone can benefit from.	2002-11-14

It gives a good amount of background such that this monster doesn't just appear out of the blue.  It's truly seamless writing that is frankly a good story, even if it were used as a recreational read.  Definitely worth buying for those interested in history, and who like a good story.<br />He covers the \\"making\\" of Schwammberger, his crimes, capture, and fascinatingly, his escape to South America.  His years of living openly are so strange to those unfamiliar with the stories of groups like Odessa, or Project Paperclip.  When entwined with the suffering of Holocaust victims, coming full circle to testify at Schwammberger's trial, offers a very well told account of some of the darkest times in history.	2002-11-14

It's fascinating to read what is going on inside the airplane at the time, but does not focus on the technical side of aircraft accidents.      The flip side is that it doesn't get weighted down with technical language or mechanical intricacies, and really adds a human touch to the crews.  The professionalism of crews both in the cockpit and in the cabin are detailed and examined, and certainly offers the reader a chance to re-evaluate the attention we pay to these individuals, who sometimes are the difference between life and death.	2002-11-14

The stories are then woven with narrative, with actual dialogue where available, that really brings to life how things go wrong and how professional most airline staff are.<br />If you find what the NTSB does fascinating, are interested in aerospace, mechanical or structural engineering, these books are required reading.

As a novice exhibitor, there are many things about showing that are baffling, to say the least (like CFA grand points).  This book does a phenomenal job of laying out all the different cat registries that hold shows and what cats will be allowed, what won't.<br />Additionally, it contains very thorough and helpful directions for grooming and bathing cats, which most owners should know, whether getting ready to show or not!  <br />Further - the breed descriptions are right on.

Stewart '26 Series)	Books	5	22	40	N	N	A Phenomenal Historical Tome	I find the criticisms of this book interesting, because it is an incredibly well-researched, thorough undertaking of the truth behind the Balkans and WWII.  Is it one sided?  When a scholarly undertaking reveals one ethnic group to be responsible for an atrocity, does that make it not objective by definition?  The answer is no.<br />This book directly refutes the claims of Serbs about their persecution in WWII (and their use of this claim in their subsequent purges of Croats, Muslims and Albanians).  The situation at the time was confusing, given all the factions that were at work at the time.  Further, even the official Yugoslavian data is either sealed from public review or patently suspect, giving rise to this book.<br />This book in no way minimizes the fact that many, many Serbs - in higher numbers than any other ethnic group, as is consistent with the population of the area - were victims of the Nazis.  However, it shows that many Serbs were also guilty of collaborating with whichever side was more convenient - which included Nazi Germany during the occupation.<br />This book is a great tool in the undertaking of study of the complexities of the Balkans and their long, bloody history.  I've read both books in this series, and find them to be quite well done and a necessity for any serious history library.	2002-04-21

After years of hearing only about the anti-Semitism of Poles, and their willingness to coldly turn in their Jewish neighbors, it is refreshing to read of what the majority of the country took part in.  The tales of Polish resistance are truly remarkable and valuable for anyone interested in the truth of WWII.<br />Lukas never makes an attempt to minimize the Jewish experience in this book; he only brings attention to the fact that five million non-Jews were also exterminated, and for Hitler, as soon as Europe was free of Jews, the Slavs were next.  I found it a very valuable, scholarly read.	2002-04-21

(I believe the first negative reviewer never \\"got\\" it.  It's a difficult abstract concept, I fully admit that.)<br />Given that knowledge, and warned that you must enter the book without a preconceived negative notion about a split type of self, this book becomes fascinating.  The details are quite dramatic, and it becomes progressively easier to see the point of the self splitting in order to survive the realities that simply can't be absorbed by the human mind.  Fascinating work, and a book you won't want to put down.	2002-01-25

The story of Walker Boh has so many dark nuances, so much internal conflict, that to read it is almost refreshing.

I'm not a fan of fantasy or science fiction, but for some reason I became hooked on this book when I was a kid. In the years since then, I've read it several more times, and each time I like it more. <br />Brooks has a fascinating way of creating three dimensional characters.  He allows you to picture them as they enter the story, both their appearance and mannerisms - which is no small feat, given that he writes of elves, dwarfs, trolls and other creatures never seen on this earth.<br />The story also contains such compelling characters, and Brooks has always maintained the undercurrent of the terrible wars that basically ended life as we know it, without ever really sharing the detail.  It's an unusual and entertaining read.	2002-01-25

I was so pleased to find this book!!<br />If you're at all interested in visiting a camp, you really should have this book - especially if you'll be visiting from outside Europe.  The minute detail - what bus and train to take, travel time, location of stops, where to go, who to talk to - it's really incredible what Marc Terrance has done.	2002-01-25

My major gripe is that I don't like calling the magic a &quot;wishsong&quot; - it just sounds too childlike to me, I suppose.<br />However, once again Brooks is marvelous, telling a seamless story even though his characters follow completely different adventures along the way.  This book is phenomenal, and if you like fantasy books you really should own the whole set.	2002-01-25

I'm reading them all for a third time - and I don't read ANY fantasy or science fiction novels. That's how good the Shannara series is.<br />I really admire the way Brooks has reached back and tied the characters together once again, allowing us to see the long ago history of the characters we've followed through this series. It's quite entertaining for a fan of the series to see the familiar names cropping up, and being able to see how these families were entwined in one another's fates from generations earlier than the first installment.	2002-01-25

I had my own hand drawn maps for years, so maybe I was predisposed to love this one!<br />I do appreciate that the characters we've known for so long can really come to life, even if the artist's conception isn't always what we imagined.  I also like having the detailed references about the items and places that the books span, and the breakdown of Paranor is fabulous!  If you love the Shannara books, you'll love this.	2002-01-25
US	50122388	R29C0WSYFGSPWA	0345370740	596230492	The Scions of Shannara (Heritage of Shannara, Book One) (The Heritage of Shannara)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Another great addition	The one drawback about this, and in fact the whole second set of Shannara books, is that they really must be read together.  I'm less enamored with this setup, as the first four books (in time, maybe not in publication order) can be read in and of themselves without confusing the reader.<br />That said, it's the beginning of a wonderful new series, one that becomes incredibly complex while never being too taxing or confusing to the reader.  Brooks is better than most at painting scenery with words, even when he's writing about mythical creatures you've never seen.	2002-01-25
US	50122388	R3LKC77PGBELR6	0345396553	798168467	Ilse Witch (The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, Book 1)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not the best, but still entertaining	Again, Brooks has started a series that requires the reader to purchase sequels rather than writing self contained novels.  I'd buy them anyway, of course, I don't think anyone is better than he at making a virtual world come alive without illustration.<br />This one is fairly predictable; from the beginning you can much more easily guess the family connections before you're told them.  Then again, Walker Boh isn't Bek's great great great (and then some) grandpa's kind of Druid, so maybe he's a bit more open.<br />I do look forward to the next installment, however, and find it an entertaining read, as always.	2002-01-25
US	50122388	R21PA7IWCM5LM	0345285549	238137791	The Elfstones of Shannara (Shannara, No. 2)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A good book, but not the best	I find it interesting that many found this to be better than the Sword of Shannara but...to each his own.  I actually was a bit turned off by the romantic storyline that wound through this book; I found it distracting from what was actually going on.  It was also a bit harder for me to become attached to the lead female character.  But, it's certainly an entertaining and worthwhile read, and the series will be enjoyed over and over (I'm on my third read of the whole first and second sets).<br />Once again Brooks proves his ability to make scenery jump off a page without the use of illustration.  A vivid adventure!	2002-01-25

Although I'm not sure that I agree with the author's conclusion, I completely appreciate the amount of study he has put into these events.  The details are phenomenal, and he points out the differing views of many other experts on his own journey.  It's an interesting read, if nothing else; if you're a shark buff, you really should have it.	2002-01-24

Given that it's the only book out there that details the Turkish Angora, it's worth picking up.  However, I like its honesty in the demeanor of the animals, and it gives good tips for anyone who is merely an owner all the way up to an exhibitor.  Great photos, too!	2002-01-24
US	50122388	R1T4YW3W91ZF95	0151758239	569467610	Quiet Neighbors: Prosecuting Nazi War Criminals in America	Books	4	5	7	N	N	A very enjoyable story	I really liked this book.  If you're at all interested in the subject, it's a necessary read along with the Nazi Hunters.  It gives wonderful background information, and a nice recitation of how they gathered the information.<br />It also shows how shamefully deficient the American legal system was in keeping out or kicking out these criminals.  About halfway through he turns into too much of an aggressive prosecutor - and the reason I don't give it five stars is because this attitude keeps escalating through a chapter on John Demjanjuk.  [For those who don't know, he's back in the US (and in deportation proceedings AGAIN) after the US sent him to Israel for trial, and their supreme court promptly decided he was NOT who we accused him of being.]  If Demjanjuk is truly not &quot;Ivan the Terrible,&quot; the author comes off looking pretty silly.<br />At any rate - it's a great book, and contains lots of references to case law and other places you can go to for more information.  Plus, it contains partial transcripts from some hearings (including Demjanjuk's) that give a chilling portrait of just how nightmarish the Holocaust was.	2001-07-06
US	50122388	RTSJIGLHDO7W2	0446358312	323350277	The Nazi Hunters	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Great book!	I loved this book - a very thorough telling of the processes of finding and pursuing war criminals.  Details many cases and individuals who you've likely not heard of and will wonder how the heck they found them!<br />All in all it's a great book.  It's a concise compilation of individual trips through the legal system, that most people would never guess is how it works.  It doesn't read like a text, though, so don't let that scare you off. It also contains a list of still-wanted criminals (at least, at the time of printing) that will make you look a little differently at your neighbors!	2001-07-06

It's a good book to grab when you catch some reference or special on television/movies, and you can get good background information on commonly known conspiracy theories.<br />The authors add their opinions - but not in a heavy handed way.  Rather, they never let you take the theories too seriously, and they try to present many sides when they exist (and debunk them when evidence dictates).  A great read that you'll pick up over and over.	2001-07-06

The writing isn't great, it's not terribly sophisticated, but that allows any level reader to understand its points.<br />I think her personal stories are a valuable asset and worth looking at.  After all, if someone born into a title, and once married to a prince, can struggle with these life issues, certainly an &quot;average&quot; person can too - and overcome them.	2001-07-06
US	50122388	R3GXWG2GZF6YUG	0449908097	498012847	The Temple Bombing	Books	5	1	2	N	N	This book is fabulous	It's incredibly well written, has a great flow, and isn't heavy handed despite it's incredible detail.  It's obvious that a great deal of research went into this volume.  It reads like a wonderfully entertaining story, while conveying what I'm certain are unfamiliar facts to most readers.  It's fascinating to see how she explains the tensions that were taking place, and the relations between two groups of people who found themselves persecuted for no good reason.  This one will be in my library for years, and is usually the first book I recommend to anyone looking for my favorite.	2001-07-06

I just can't get beyond the poor quality of writing, the incessant rambling about nothing, stories with no point.  I suspect the  reader doesn't need more than half of the background on what it's like to  be thirteen - not to mention those who may not sympathize with a girl who  is growing up in privilege and complaining about it.  I wouldn't waste the  money - there are plenty of less painful ways to learn about the dangers of  the internet than reading this book.	2000-05-08
