Along with William Ball's superb A SENSE OF DIRECTION, Director and instructor John Ahart's THE DIRECTOR'S EYE stand as the finest book ever written about the art of directing. <br /> <br />Breaking down the mystery of directing into simple yet illuminating steps, Ahart takes great pains to celebrate the individual voice and the joy inherent in the art of the collaborative theatre. <br /> <br />Ahart stresses the importance of finding the artist's point of view and marrying it to the author's text in creating a staged performance. Carefull to discriminate between merely \\"staging\\" a play from \\"directing\\", Ahart lays out several activities and philosophies designed to create a safe and collaborative environment where the actors and the director (as well as designers and the rest of the production staff) work to create a unified production that can move an audience. <br /> <br />Ahart should actually have called the book, THE DIRECTOR'S HEART as he repeatedly stresses the importance of using the natural and personal experienceds that one brings to the creative table. He constantly (and rightfully) stresses that the creative process is NOT an intellectual excersise but rather one of passion. It is the intellect though that focuses and DIRECTS the passion towards a single, focuses point. <br /> <br />Written in an inspirational, approachable and helpful tone, THE DIRECTOR'S EYE is a must have for any director and actor.	2005-08-21

Breaking down acting into simple (albeit far too simple-hence the 4 star rating)and applicable steps, Richardson approaches acting as a joyful and natural form of human expression. <br /> <br />While the book doesn't really provide as many usefull lessons (a few more would have earned the book a slightly higher rating)as attending a class would, it does communicate a clear philosophy that makes acting accessible to a wider variety of students. <br /> <br />Richardson attacks the psuedo-pyschiatric approaches made popular by too many 20th Century acting teachers and sticks to the very basics. A successful director himself (unlike the most of the pantheon of American Acting teachers- Adler, Meisner, Strassberg- Lewis being the exception)Richardson takes great pains to approach acting from both sides of the camera and stage. His teaching method is to make acting as painless as possible. <br /> <br />Too bad this is relatively hard to get ahold of. A valuable addition to any actor's library.	2005-08-21

Journalist and rabid Crimson Tide fan Warren St. John, with RAMMER JAMMER BIG YELLOW HAMMER , creates the finest book yet written about College Football's most fascinating ingredient- its fans.  <br /> <br />Expertly combining perceptive social commentary, vivid character study, hilarious self-deprecating humor and expert research with travelogue, St. John writes in a raucous voice capturing an articulate beer-soaked harangue over a tailgate feast of barbeque and shots. <br /> <br />Depicting his year spent following the hard partying RV tail gate culture of a group of Alabama Fans, St. John never fails to both entertain and educate as he provides valuable insights into the sport fan behavior. <br /> <br />While comparisons to Nick Hornsby's superb FEVER PITCH are obvious and appropriate, one must also add comparisons to THE ELECTRIC KOOL-AIDE ACID TEST and heavy dollops of Hunter S Thompson to this new classic. One of the year's greatest works of non-fiction. A must read! <br />	2005-07-28

While Wisner's writing skills do not come any where near the depth, scope and complexity of a Bill Bryson he does manage, with this entertaining debut, to capture and communicate a personal travelouge/memoir that vibrates with equal parts sadness, humour,history and a healthy (and suprising!) bit of eroticism. <br /> <br />In an attempt to convalesce a broken heart after being literally stood up at the alter, Wisner invites his recently divorced brother to join him in a world hopping tour of off-the-beaten track exotic locations. Along the way he learns volumes about himself, his brother and the world in the process. <br /> <br />Granted, on many levels Wisner treads little new ground here. And admittedly too his style and technical skill is a work very much in progress (hence the relatively low rating).  <br /> <br />But that quibble aside, HONEYMOON WITH MY BROTHER contains many fine vinettes (love the portrait of his adopted grandmother-LaRue!)and misadventures (a particularly colorful bus ride in Africa). Wisner is always sincere and forthcoming in his revelations and discoveries. <br /> <br />All in all a fine light hearted addition to any summer reading list.	2005-06-04

The result of this ambitious and courageous project is a heartbreaking, captivating and ultimately transcendent oral history.<br /><br />The stories here filled with an evolution that mirrors the changes of perception that accompanied the war. This is not only a history of women in Vietnam (a history all too frequently too overlooked)but also a history of America as well. Each woman, in her own way experiences the journey from ambition to horror to disillusionment to healing. Many of the women interviewed (as of 1985)are still works very much in progress- as our Nation is as well.<br /><br />This oral history depicts not only depicts the immediate horrors and consequences of combat but most importantly the post combat experience as well along with the living conditions and political environment as seen in the first person.<br /><br />Later adapted (by Shirley Lauro) into a powerful dramatic event, A PIECE OF MY HEART makes for a must read for anyone interested in either Vietnam history specifically or American history in general.<br /><br />A classic.	2005-06-04

Krakauer is considerate enough to constantly restate that he is not condemning any ONE religion or practice, but rather seeking to scale the heights of the human pscyhe when dealing with issues of religious faith and practice. <br /> <br />This is NOT an attack on people of faith in general or Mormonism in specific. Again Krakauer makes the case that extremist beliefs abound in ALL religions. <br /> <br />That said (after reading so many of the derogatory comments on this product, I feel I must clarify), UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN is a nail biting and fascinating journey into the hearts and minds of the Lafferty Brothers two Mormon Fundamentalists who, in 1985 slit the throats of both their infant niece and sister in law. <br /> <br />Krakeur combines painstaking historical research with objective and yet empathetic insight to portray a true to life thrilling saga that is still a story in progress. His ability to place specific individuals within the broad sociological context of American History is an admirable trait that makes for an excellent read. <br /> <br />A fine work of journalism not to be missed.	2005-02-17

Using his unique blend of travellouge, history and personal memoir Bryson paints a fascinating portrait of a nation rich in culture and vast in space but unfortunately overlooked by much of the rest of the world. <br /> <br />Using his unique brand of scatalogical humor and personal insight (his description of not only how he sleeps but how he reacts to fear inspires peals of raging laughter)Bryson journeys throughout Australia's varied continent absorbing many of her treasures and traps. IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY, Bryson debunks many misconceptions about the former British Penal Colony as well as holds up the special personalities that make her citizens stand proud. He goes beyond the \\"Steve Irwin and Crocodile Dundee\\" stereotypes and paints a picture of a nation filled with world class intellectuals and athletes.  <br /> <br />He also refuses to pull any punches as he frequently tempers the humor with many sobering truths (the treatment of the Aboriginies to mention just one example). That he can be so balanced is a testament to his talent as a writer. <br /> <br />According to Bryson, Australia is a country filled with the most hostile ecosystem on earth and yet thrives with perhaps the most diverse biological assortment known to man. It is a special place. I may not be able to afford a trip yet. But Bryson's book is almost as good as being there. <br /> <br />Almost.	2005-02-08

In his helpful, thoroughly accessible and entirely entertaining AN AGENT TELLS ALL, Mr. Martinez, assumes two truths about his perspective (and specific) audience. <br /> <br />1) Either they are complete and utter neophytes wearing rose-colored glasses entering a noble profession with visions of red carpet glory. <br /> <br />OR <br /> <br />2) They are experienced actors who have had their souls and bums kicked by the reality that professional acting is ultimately nothing more than an industry and need to heal and adjust after a few years of making the same mistakes repeatedly. <br /> <br />Writing in a direct, unpretentious, jargon-free style that invokes visions of a long conversation over a lunch of cheap margaritas and oysters in the half shell, Martinez refreshingly holds nothing back as he sets out to define not only the agent's job, but the actor's job as well. Like Denzel's character in PHILADELPHIA, he works hard to explain everything to his readers, as though they were four years old.  Ultimately the business all boils down to building relationships and being completely committed to constantly evolving as both an artist and as a person. <br /> <br />Cutting through all the empty  \\"positive-think\\" self- help posings of so many other similar authors, Martinez rightfully portrays acting as a capitalist venture based upon the laws of supply and demand. If an actor has never thought of themselves as a product, it is time they did. If they have never before considered the acting industry as a world of Social Darwinism- it also is time they did. <br /> <br />But Martinez is not here just to micturate upon dreams, dashing them out in the guise of name dropping and power tripping. His ultimate objective is to provide the actor (and ultimately too, the agent) advice and specific tools to increase one's chances of not only survival, but success. His advice is always both practical (get a map of LA, keep working, be prepared and get over yourself) and personal (he provides many fine anecdotes illustrating the \\"do's\\" and \\"don'ts\\"). <br /> <br />At a quick, easy to read 211 pages, AN AGENT TELLS ALL deserves to become a dog-eared personal reference for all who dare to enter the world's most noblest profession. He constantly emphasizes how special actors are and urges all to look at their craft as a business yes, but also a dignified art. He has no intention to install despair- just reality. His experience provides positive solutions to age old problems that seem to plague many who enter the industry without any frame of reference. <br /> <br />His constant litany is: be smart while one keeps working and, most importantly, be a decent human being. For at the end of the day, it is the relationships one develops with themselves and the people around them that will carry one through to the end. <br /> <br />This is a must read. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Despair is the only unforgivable sin, and it's always reaching for us.\\" <br />- Sam Peckinpah <br />	2005-02-01

Depicting Mag's slow evolution from long-haired college drop-out ne'er do well to college graduate back to factory worker (Mr. Magnuson is currently a college professor), LUMMOX fills itself with painfully honest self-deprication, nimble attacks on pseudo-intellectualism and brilliant character studies. This is not a book for the politically correct or over-sensitive as it pulls no punches. Inviting equal parts laughter, tears and painfull introspection (there is far too much reader identification here), Magnuson captures a specific region (in this case the often frozen tundra of Wisconsin) and its inhabitants in a personal and captivating way.    A great find and well worth the time.	2005-01-11

Always able to deftly combine erudite scholarship with personal insight and extremely salty humour, Bryson leads his audience through a personal journey of not only the American landscape but also his spititual topography as well. <br /> <br />As he journeys across small town America- in a search for \\"Anytown USA\\" (an amalgam of all those MGM/Capraesque bygone hamlets), he wistfully searches to reclaim all the memories of his father. His father, a sportswriter, apparently led the Bryson brood on a multitude of spendthrift odysseys. As Bryson retraces the journeys of his childhood he relives so many rich memories that alternate between the comical and the honestly nostalgic without resorting to cheap sentimentality. <br /> <br />Bryson constantly reveals little known histories and local color all the while criticizing and celebrating the subtle nuances that make up the American landscape. He takes shots at the obvious- strip malls, over commericalization and cheap tourist traps in ways that both raise the reader's ire and appeals to the sense of whimsy as well. <br /> <br />Probably Bryson's greatest trick lies in his ability to inspire his reader to undertake similar journeys. <br /> <br />A great read. <br /> <br />	2004-11-23

Drawing from an exhaustive resevoir of interviews, anecdotal illuminations, criticisms and Dickey's work itself, Hart has painstakingly researched the life of a man who barricaded himself inside a fortress of glorious self-promotion.  <br /> <br />By all accounts, the difficult Dickey loved the accolades and trappings of fame and worked extremely hard to promote his finely crafted poetry by painting himself as both the uber wilderness alpha male as well as the backwoods red neck. Following in the self mythologing traditions of Hemingway and others, Dickey, a former advertising executive knew how to market a product and became his greatest pitchman. Exploiting America's love of the violent pioneer, he quickly confused fact with reality. For underneath all the bluff, bluster and macho posings,there lay a sensitive, cultured aesthete who favored the creature comforts of the upper middle class. <br /> <br />Much to Hart's credit, he always keeps rightly focused on both Dickey's fine literary output as well as his highly respected career as a college professor. Despite all of Dickey's claims to the contrary, Hart reminds us that here was first rate literary critic and devoted instructor. Hart takes the position that in many respects Dickey became America's answer to Dylan Thomas. <br /> <br />THE WORLD AS A LIE, paints a compelling portrait of an often abrasive, but always fascinating artist. This is a great literary biography. A must read for all Dickey fans.	2004-09-04

The perniciousness of lying and the often tragic consequences therein form the spine of this, Hellman's first major success on the Broadway stage.<br />Concerning a scandal at a private girl's school, Hellman bravely dramatizes the scars and cycles of abuse which result not only from lying but also from ignorance and cowardice. As I prepare this script for production in the fall of 2004, I find its themes timeless and as hard hitting as any contemporary work.<br />In Mary Tilford, Hellman has created one of the American Theatre's great villians. She serves as the literary model for \\"Rhoda\\" in THE BAD SEED as well as \\"Abigail\\" in THE CRUCIBLE. She is the embodiment of souless evil, intent on destroying all around her in order to advance her own status. She is the type of character that can truly, to quote RICHARD III, \\"Smile and murder whilst I smile\\". As my cast staged a rough read through, the hisses and rage she inspires is frightening.<br />Poetic without being obscure or pretentious, the dialouge is crisp and direct. Hellman's characters are three-dimensional and her pacing and story-telling is impeccable. I hope our production will do this great play justice.<br />As for any potential readers of this play: don't hestitate. Add this to you theatre library immediately.	2004-06-12

Liberals and Conservatives receive broadsword swashes and pin-point snipes in equal measures. Hughes calls ultimately calls for true eclectism as opposed to multi-culturalism- a movement in his mind that wrongly excludes other cultures in favor of often fictious historical revisionism.<br />The rich bounty of American Culture, Hughes claims-the very culture that inspired him to leave Australia and settle in New York- lies in her melting pot of culture. America, in Hughes' expert eye, is a beautiful amalgamation of many cultures: European, Native, African, Spanish, Asian and so forth. He sees history as a complex organism made up of many diverse parts. Effective scholarship, debate and production must incorperate all while eschewing the demagoguery and finger pointing that tragically seems to prevail in so much public discourse.<br />Make no mistake,like any good critic or thinker, Hughes is out to pick a fight and he certainly challenges all comers. One may not agree with all of his points or supports, but that isn't the point. Hughes' number one objective is to confront American apathy with an electo-shock to the system.<br />In short, Hughes does indeed call for a certain brand of elitism in both art and public life. An elitism bred not of social class, race or economics but rather an hierarchy based upon skill, intelligence and vision.<br />THE CULTURE OF COMPLAINT will challenge the reader as well as entertain.

Formerly titled THE LAST RIDE, author Thomas Eidson mixes the concepts of Grace, Justice, Hope, Pennance and Family with the age old Western genre elements of Wilderness, Violence, Horses, Savagery and Strength and creates a great contemporary Western.<br />The characters of Samuel Jones and his daughter Maggie and grandaughters Lily and Dot are destined to become classic figures in the Western pantheon. They are flawed to be sure, but endowed with healthy portions of intelligence, resolve and spiritual endownment. Eidson brilliantly creates strong women characters, deftly able to bridge the femine nurturing instinct with the warrior spirit- perhaps his greatest achievement with this book. He also uses his narrative to explore, challenge the concept of, and define the notion of \\"Family\\"- both extended and nuclear.<br />THE LAST RIDE (now called THE MISSING), ventures into the bloody, eerie and mythical territory of Carmac McCarthy and Larry McMurtry. It is not a book for the faint of heart or weak of heart.<br />On a personal note, I really value Eidson's willingness to confront the issues of Christian values as well as Native American spiritualism and finding the common ground between them.

Immediate. Jarring. Embracing the post-modern writing approach which focuses upon stream of consciousness prose which incorperates fragments and run-ons, Swofford's excellent memoir/chronicle achieves an informality that places him inside the reader's head and heart.<br />JARHEAD becomes required reading for anyone interested in military history in the sense that his writing captures a unique psychological voice. Swofford's Marine experience certainly isn't meant to be considered ideal or even typical- it simply is his experience. Fortunately he possesses no pretensions otherwise- JARHEAD is just HIS memoir/chronicle. <br />JARHEAD focuses not on combat action but rather the psychological wear and tear that Swofford and his Marine sniper platoon experienced. He vividly and graphicaly captures the results of the impressive air war which led to the coalition's resounding success in Operation Desert Storm.<br />I also appreciated Swofford's liking combat films (from all eras) to pornography of a sort. Swofford's JARHEAD works hard to avoid this connection. Swofford seems to understand all too well that most audiences revel in battlefield action. <br />Not the definitive work about THE GULF WAR, but because of its strong personal voice, JARHEAD is a must read.	2004-01-04

This obstacle results in a hap-hazard biography that provides few surprises or insights into the laconic, silent man who has become on of America's true unique artists.<br />Schickel also drives a stake through the pacing of his writing by providing scene by scene recounts of each of Eastwood's key films. He is overlooking the fact that the majority of his intended audience already has each film memorized. This causes the book to often languish in molasses and cause the reader to skim- never a good thing.<br />Where Schickel does succeed is in the all-too brief insights into Eastwood's technique and artistic philosophy. Had Schickel chosen to focus in this area, his work would have provided more depth and sustained interest.<br />As is CLINT EASTWOOD: A BIOGRAPHY is a mixed bag read.

As with all of Alexie's work, THE TOUGHEST INDIAN IN THE WORLD resounds with humor, tragedy and tender hope.These stories bodly confront the conflict between tradition, assimilation and duty. With this collection he also adds a  strain of homo-eroticism as well as a celebration of education (I find it fascinating that most of his protagonists are educated and literate). <br />Alexie stands as one of America's finest contemporary writers.

Especially if one is a single parent. In this case, Ehrenreich breaks no new ground here. With this book, she is already preaching to the choir. However we all still need preaching. For this truth needs constant re-enforcing.<br />Placing herself in the position of a maid, waitress, nursing home worker and retail clerk, the author re-discovers the hard truth: that working at a low wage becomes a monotonous and often degrading cycle that becomes difficult to break. Sometimes people do not always choose to be poor (an attitude often shared by liberal and conservative thinkers alike). <br />Recent administrations, both Republican and Democratic alike have championed the number of jobs they have created and the welfare reforms they have enacted.Unfortunately most of those &quot;created&quot; jobs do no pay a living wage. The truth remains that there are no simple solutions to the age old issue of working class poverty.<br />Still NICKEL AND DIMED reminds its readers to empathize with the workers burdened with making everyone else's lives easier. These are the people who make the food cheaper, clean the toilets and wipe the aged bums- jobs that are all noble in so much as they provide necessary services and are deserving of the same services and opportunities everyone else enjoys in a free society. <br />A good fast read that ultimately re-affirms the truth.

Eschewing simple HALLMARK CARD sentimentality and post-modern sound bite obsession, Buechner lays out a series of daily meditations that comfort, challenge and re-enforce as well as affirm one's faith.<br />I particularly admire Buechner's constant celebration of the purity of silence- the need for listening and contemplation.<br />An excellent daily devotional written by one of our finest contemporary theologians.	2003-12-31

While filled with action, heroism and an epic scope, like all of Ambrose's work, BAND OF BROTHERS suffers from a curious fault- it is written by a historian who holds so much reverential love for his subject that he doesn't really know how to edit. This is really a small matter for admist all the minutia (which does often bog the central narrative down in footnotes), Ambrose does the men of Company E proud and captures their stories in many heartbreaking first person narratives spanning from basic training to VE day. <br />This singular aspect will stand as the late Ambrose's greatest contribution as pop historian- he etched in stone the oral history of the 20th century's greatest generation.<br />While broader in scope that THE MEN OF COMPANY K (an even greater WW II history that is now sadly OOP), BAND OF BROTHERS does often lose the immediacy and intimacy required of an oral history that former title so expertly captured.<br />But I am only splitting hairs, BAND OF BROTHERS is a must read deserves a spot on any history buff's shelf. A contemporary classic history.	2003-12-24

Howard Blum, in interviewing three key players, brings to life the stunning, action-packed and bloody history of this brigade which fought not just for freedom, but for vengence as well. Blum captures the complex history of British Palestine, the disinigration of post-war Europe, the survival of concentration camp refugees as well as the iron will it took all Isrealis to forge a nation in a just a few pages. Through the words of the survivors he also paints a vivid picture of the slow soul assissination that occurs when one seeks vengence. A lightening fast read that finally flashes some light on a nearly forgotten piece of history. A must read!	2003-10-14

While teaching a lesson on painting, Thomas Hart Benton told Dennis Hopper to \\"Think loose and paint tight\\". <br />The late Ken Kesey's unique literary gifts and contributions lay in his incredible ability to \\"think loose and write tightly.\\"<br />In both of his great works, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION, as well as some of his journalistic writing, Kesey brilliantly channeled magnificent, electric, free-floating, randomly abstract and stream of conscious ideas into tight, elegant sentences. Kesey forged the missing link between the spontaneous prose of Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs and the Beats with the laser-like precision of Hemingway and Fitzgerald. <br />While LAST GO ROUND certainly makes for a fast and fun read, it does not represent his finest work. Attempting to write a combination camp fire story/dime store novel Kesey allows himself to invert his precious balance. <br />Thinking tightly in the surprisingly demanding genre bounds of oral history and pulp, Kesey simply tries too hard. LAST GO ROUND lacks the spontaneous element of creation that courses throughout all his greatest work. Creatively he appears to be straining and reaching for ideas that should come easily.<br />While the creativity seems pushed, the writing itself appears unpolished and unfocused, relatively devoid of the razor sharp perceptions that one expects from a great author. <br />Ultimately though, this is really a small matter. Based on a historical event- The first Pendleton Round-Up (based in my hometown), Kesey does infuse his narrative with rich local color and texture. Having met the real George Fletcher when he was aged and in a nursing home, the story also has strong personal connections for me. That, and my personally autographed copy ofthe book from the late Kesey makes LAST GO ROUND a valued sentimental possession.<br />Not a classic by any stretch, but certainly worth reading. Especially for fans of Kesey.	2003-07-27

His humor, characterization and descriptions of geographical space (my native Oregon)all remain intact and on a level with his finest work. <br />Some vinettes are obviously more memorable than others and often the writing seems unfocused and in need of editing.<br />This is really a small matter considering that this is the closest to a autobiography the world will ever get.

In a bold stroke, he populates the family Tyrone with a menagerie of fragile beings who find strength in language and discourse. It is little wonder that O'Neill demanded that LONG DAY's remain unproduced until after his death. He his boldly facing every personal and familial demon. With crashing honesty and a touch of jet-black humor, he leaves no stone uncovered as he weaves a horrifying tale of the ultimate dysfunctional family.<br />LONG DAY'S JOURNEY into night is not for the weak of back or the faint of heart. It is depressing to be sure. But among the rubble of these tortured lives, O'Neill finds the spiritual strength in these flawed and fallen angels and creates true linguistic magic.

His youngest daughter may have inherited both as the play centers around identifying the authorship of a magnificent mathematical proof (which ends up being a brilliant use of Hitchcock's &quot;McGuffin&quot; rule).<br />Auburn creates a play filled with an excellent series of suprises, revelations and passionate debates. His narrative is well structured as it provides the actors with clear objectives and a variety of tactics to explore and enact, all engaging the audience's attention and energy.<br />Four of my friends recently produced the play and produced an evening of magic. A great theatrical experience demands a strong story to tell and Auburn provides such a vehicle with this, his Pulitzer Prize winning work. <br />A brilliant piece of writing. A must read for theatre fans and practitioners alike. A most producable work as well. It would make for a fine addition to any theatre season.	2003-07-26

An actor's job in receiving training is to simply find the approach that works best for the individual. Method acting simply means to find one's own method. While responses to acting texts, approaches and classes are always subjective, one should always remain open for new ideas.<br />That said I reject Eric Morris' approach to acting on a personal and professional level.<br />As every actor knows (or at least should know), his/her job is \\"to do nothing more than to be believable while telling the best possible story that serves the script\\" (Bruce Morris). Or as Stanislavski defines acting: \\"Acting is living truthfully under imaginary circumstances\\". The root of an actor's technique must always be action. Again with Stanislavski: \\"while on stage, an actor must always be enacting something\\". Action verbs are the basis of all acting/storytelling craft. An audience does not pay precious money to watch an actor have an emotional moment, but rather to have the moment themselves. <br />All the great acting teachers, building upon the work of Stanislavski, have stressed the importance of finding and playing an action as opposed to an emotion. Robert Lewis, Sanford Meisner, Stella Adler, Uta Hagen, Michael Checkov and even Lee Strassberg (although he ventured too far into the emotional realm) all taught students to find the appropriate action and embrace that reality as the basis for their storytelling craft. Emotions are the by product of a person engaging in an action and either failing or succeeding in the quest to fulfill that action. <br />Eric Morris' approach, centers on \\"Being\\" exercises. He asks his students to simply get up in front of a group of people and simply \\"Be\\". As related in this book, he proceeds to grill them about their day and call them on the carpet for any false emotion as he dredges for some emotional moment. Morris' approach, at least to this reader, comes off as simply another example of acting teacher \\"power tripping\\" as well as pseudo-therapy hidden in the guise of acting. This approach simply leads to the teacher holding such power over his/her students as they become obsessed with pleasing the teacher as opposed to truly pleasing the audience.<br />This approach leads to emotionally crippling an actor. Actor's become obsessed with evaluating their acting on the basis of whether or not they \\"felt\\" the scene. If an actor finds they cannot reach the emotion, they immediately fill themselves with a great sense of guilt and personal disgust at their inability to produce an emotion. Acting should ultimately be a freeing experience as well as a fun and celebratory bit of life. Many acting teachers and actors, bowing under the weight of thousands of years of social stigma feel that they must deny the \\"fun\\" factor of acting and make it a painful and serious affair.<br />As any director or acting teacher can attest, when one simply asks an actor to \\"be\\" on stage, one will watch an actor squirm, blink and fold inside him/her self. Put an actor on stage and ask him/her to push a giant stone up a mountain, one will watch a fantastic story filled with all the emotional truth an audience could ever hope to find. <br />The key to acting is not \\"being\\" it is in fact \\"doing\\". Apparently Morris has a workbook that combines the two concepts. I will certainly read that as well- again the justification for the high rating. I am still learning my craft and I pray I will always continue to do so.<br />NO ACTING PLEASE is certainly worth reading and worth trying though so that one can form their own opinion. After trying Morris' approach, this review is simply my opinion. Proceed with caution.	2003-07-24

According to Schlosser, American culture has become defined by the entire concept of fast food. Through stripmalling, anti-labor practices, mass production,and swelling waistlines, America's landscape looks sadly bland, uniform and souless. <br />This is not to suggest that hope has vanished. Schlosser points out businesses that have retained solid and sanitary practices (In and Out Burger)and points to positive results of consumer outrage. Fast Food Nation is a call to action for all Americans to seriously evaluate the origins of our food and our culture. Schlosser's excellent and detailed reporting, along with his expert ability to turn a phrase, illuminates the entire process that produces our nation's (and ultimately the world's) food.

Roosevelt, while beloved as perhaps no other President in history also had his enemies and Morris meets them all head on. That is exactly as TR would have wanted it.<br />The blustery, hyperactive and thourougly intellectual Roosevelt was a complete human being, according to Morris.

Undaunted Courage, along with the equally excellent Band of Brothers, stands as one of the late Ambrose's greatest achievements. Ambrose always succeeded in making history come brilliantly to life, wiping all the cobwebs from dry academia and inspiring his readers to share in his unbridled passion.<br />In many ways, Undaunted Courage may be his finest work for Ambrose writes using no first person source material. With his canon of WWII histories, Ambrose was able to interview living history and record those unique experiences for all posterity.<br />With the Lewis and Clark expedition, his task is far more daunting as he attempts to breathe life into an epic journey that occurred two hundred years ago.<br />Using journals, and as always, a wide and exhaustive bibliography, Ambrose, as in all his work, makes the past personal and immediate. Using his interpretive powers, he manages to portray Lewis and Clark as three dimensional characters with warts and faults. He also makes their journey breathe with suspense, tension and the overwhelming beauty of the natural world. Ambrose never lets the reader forget the sheer awesome task that Lewis and Clark set out to do. Their struggles for survival on the expansive frontier make for an often white knuckled page turning experience.<br />Undaunted Courage is simply an excellent and entertaining read.	2003-03-28

His writing is clear, clever and well supported as is his ability to turn a phrase. Whether one agrees with Moore or not (and as I said previously, I certainly don't) is simply not the issue, he provides an extremely fascinating, inspiring and entertaining call to arms for all people to voice their opinions and take social action.<br />We must all be willing to take an active role in our society, perhaps as active as Moore himself. The time to be passive consumers of mass culture has ended and we must all ante up and kick in.

To quote Peter Fonda's drug addled psuedo-anti-hero in the beautifully misshapen but stunningly and ironically prophetic \\"Easy Rider\\": \\"We blew it Billy\\".<br />Biskind does much to certainly promote the cult of the most overrated generation in history. But he does so by articulating and defending his point in a fast paced entertaining manner. Filling his pages with gleefully geeky tidbits of juicy bad behavior, Biskind edifys his position by balancing praise with vicious criticism. He calls the players all on the carpet and takes them to task for burning out in their own pathetic yet arrogant fires of ego-centric excess while managing to celebrate their true works of ground breaking film art.<br />Biskind appropriately bookends his journey with the equally self centered and no less destructive Jake LaMotta in Scorsese's brilliant film \\"Raging Bull\\".

Robert Shaw's brilliant performance stands as no match for Doug Stanton's classic reporting.<br />Stanton's book brings to life the brutal, terryifying and ultimately heroic experience to life. Using interviews (God bless the survivors for all their candor, honesty and accesibility- now their experience is recorded for all posterity), Stanton takes a harrowing and epic experience and renders it in simple, intimate strokes. Stanton writes with the narrative acrobatics of an escapist novelist. <br />The scars and wounds The Indianapolis experience etched into the lives of the boys who became men while they were in the water tragically proved trivial to the railroading the brave Captain McVay received. Stanton works wonders toward praising his considerable leadership and restoring his character to the respect it deserves.<br />\\"In Harm's Way\\" is not for the faint of heart. It is gut wrenching and absolutely scorching. These men went through blue watered hell and Stanton puts the reader as close as we could possibly ever want to venture.

It is impossible for me to find the words necessary to describe the intense love I (and many of my closest friends) have for this, Larry McMurty's, finest work.The adjective \\"effusive\\" and \\"awestruck\\" does not begin to scratch the surface of my deep feeling for this magnificent and contemporary American Epic.<br />In \\"Lonesome Dove\\", McMurtry takes the linear narrative and creates a work art. Granted his simple prose does not reach the heights of a true literary artist like say Pinchon, Vonnegut,Wolfe or even McMurtry's friend the young Kesey. McMurty focuses his narrative abilities toward crafting characters and simply actions that transcend the page and truly transport the reader to a time that could only exist in a romantic mind dancing above feet firmly planted in solid Texas prairie.<br />The characters of Gus, Call, Pea-Eye, Lorena, July, and Deets are all beautiful well rounded human beings containing nuances and dimensions of any character in literary history. <br />Yes that is a tall statement, but McMurtry has crafted a tale that makes a thousand plus pages fly by effortlessly. His depictions of setting and his ability to relate dialouge are finely honed as his uncanny ability to vacillate between the comical and the brutal. His sense of moral order and redemption is also most admirable and uplifting.<br />I have read \\"Lonesome Dove\\" cover to cover at least five times. And like a good, close and intimate friend, it always suprises me by playing out like a first meeting. If you do not care for the western genre, no matter, this fine novel will allow you forget your bias for a brief while. If you love the genre, welcome this contemporary classic into your heart.<br />On a side note: I have used this book as a reading text for low level, non readers in the high school setting and have always (and I mean always)watched \\"Lonesome Dove\\" captivate a young audience with its colorful story. It is a great addition to any American Lit. curriculumn.	2003-03-14

It concerns two moronic hit men cut of silent film comedy cloth, a set of spinster twins harboring deep sexual desire, an aged \\"Lurch\\" like butler and an \\"Id\\" monster of imagined horror. And this is just scratching the surface of Brautigan's finest novel.<br />Brautigan is an aquired taste. One can easily apply the adjectives \\"elliptical\\", \\"ambigious\\" and \\"pretentious\\" when describing his work. Granted too, the short story and the poem were always his strongest format.<br />But Brautigan is never boring. His prose while fearless if a bit reckless never fails to paint unique images. Yes, while it is true that Brautigan frequently comes off as a prepubescent boy writing to stimulate his bubbling loins, he does balance it with a sincere ability to turn a phrase and capture a moment that could only exist in a fevered imagination. Brautigan was a unique voice now tragically silent.<br />It also passes a unique piece of criteria I have for any good book. It has to be read. This book is not filmable in any way. Thank God for that. Far too often, authors write with lucrative film rights dancing in their eyes. It is sad, yet strangely fortunate that Brautigan died before major prepackaged film deals completely nearly crippled the written word.<br />For those who enjoy taking literary risks without any guarantees, The Hawkline Monster comes highly reccomended. It is a fun, haunting and one of a kind way to spend a dark and stormy weekend.	2003-03-05

Wrong.<br />According to Weddle, Sam Peckinpah himself had already beaten me to the punch.<br />In reading David Weddle's expansively researched and annotated biography of one of film's great colorful and tragic characters, I rediscovered the suprisingly sentimental and softly poetic side of Peckinpah. <br />Influenced tremendously by the symbollic stage poetry of Tennesse Williams (Sam was one of his champions!)along with the he-man adventures of John Ford, Howard Hawks and John Huston, Peckinpah brilliantly (admittedly only consistent in three films)managed to combine both seemingly polarized worlds.<br />Weddle really brings to light the complex character of Sam Peckinpah. Weddle pulls no punches and portrays the director as abusive, selfish, self destructive, malignant and paranoid. He also illuminates the softer, romantic side that created some legitimate and heartbreakingly penetrating works of art. Sam felt moved by poetry and the longing we all have to find the innocent and pure sides of our selves. He searched for salvation. Even in the hearts of deeply flawed and violent men. Knowing that he, like his famous protagnists, would only find it in honorable death. <br />Weddle does a fine and admirable job painstakingly finding the autobiographical currents running through all of Peckinpah's work.Weddle really shines as a film critic as he deconstructs all of Sam's work. He deftly balances negativity with effusiveness like a fine concert pianist. Like Williams' masterpieces, Peckinpah used his art to exorcise his demons. <br />It is so refreshing to learn that Peckinpah did not justeducate himself on a diet of films, as so many young directors choose to limit themselves. He was a voracious reader of philosophy, history and literature. He loved the stage.<br />Many of Peckinpah's fans will already know much of the incidents present in the book, which will cause one to skim. But when Weddle works to humanize a deeply misunderstood artist, this book really shines.	2003-03-04

Drawing from copious research and rare documents, Irving works wonders humanizing one of the truly mythic characters to rise out of the ashes of the Second World War. Rommel was always dubiously viewed by the allied press and his Allied foes as a &quot;Good German&quot;. Irving works extremely hard (and therefore, courts controversy) at painting Rommel as a brilliant soldier, philosopher and engineer who, had he surived the war, could have very easily played a critical peacetime role in the restructuring of Europe. This book belongs on the shelf of every person possessing even a casual interest in the history of the second world war. Guaranteed not to disappoint.	2003-02-09

Present here is his advice to all directors, that new (really only invented in the latter part of the 19th century)creature of the world's oldest art form. Clurman displays his analytical abilities certainly in discribing script breakdowns and picturalization, but he also reveals a real understanding of human nature. His advice on how to deal with problems and crises that always appear during a production prove most sagelike. Purchase this along with William Ball's superlative &quot;A Sense Of Direction&quot; along with William Converse's textbook &quot;Directing For The Stage&quot; to create a most helpful library for any director.	2003-02-09

His madly brilliant ability to fuse language into spirit  makes him a radical voice able to transcend the written page and flash fire across the stormy night.<br />He shows no fear in his &quot;blazing like meteors&quot; of imagery, sound and style. His utter passion for language and all its power vibrates like the Oceanic fury which crashed against his childhood home. Like all great poetry, Thomas should be read aloud and with a great burning green fury. His poetry is metaphor to live by. Filled with all the experience of the total human being, Thomas teaches us to value, treasure and drink deep the glorious well of creation.<br />Like many great artists, his life was far too brief. But his lines remain immortal. This is a volume I hold close and sacred to my very heart.	2003-02-05

Mandela deftly avoids simply demonizing the brutal white doctrines that oppressed Blacks for years. He also lays plenty of responsibility on the doorstep of the years of tribal hatred and ethnic strife that has plagued his people for centuries. His brave effort to bridge years of hatred, war and oppression makes for mandatory reading for all people regardless of race or nationality as it is a fight we all find ourselves steeped.<br />This is not to suggest that this book makes for a dry read. Quite the opposite. Mandela is a born leader and his rich use of language makes his journey all the more personal and, therefore all the more universal. A powerful story for all to read.	2003-02-04

When viewed in that context, this book serves its purpose well. Having used this text in conjunction with William Ball's superb book &quot;A Sense Of Direction&quot;, in the directing class I teach, I have found Converse's excercises to be helpful and precise (if rather dry) in building craft. Especially helpful is Converse's chapters on blocking and creating pictures. His suggestions and activities designed to teach one how to communicate and direct traffic are most helpful. If one is looking for a great read, this is not the book to use. For that I again suggest Ball or Clurman's fine &quot;On Directing&quot;. But for some &quot;hands on&quot; activities in the dramatic classroom or for the director just starting out on their own, this will work just fine- as long as you have someone else to bounce your ideas off of.	2003-02-04

Truman running second). Morris, a South African, approaches his subject with the hyperactive awe filled eye that TR himself viewed the world. Writing in robust prose containing figurative language befitting a fine work of fiction, Morris packs his 780 pages with glorious details that flash pure linguistic lightening. The nearly 100 pages of notes at the end also serve as fascinating reading: a rare trick indeed.<br />&quot;The Rise Of Theodore Roosevelt&quot; richly deserves the honor of being one of the finest biographies ever written. It is a gold standard of the biographical genre as it manages to deftly and expertly balance scholarship with entertainment. <br />Along with David McCullough's equally excellent &quot;Truman&quot; this certainly stands as required reading for anyone interested in Presidential history in specific and American History in general. Purchase this. You will not be dissappointed.	2003-01-30

This, the first volume of a two volume work (this is by far the stronger of the two)may not contain the strongest prose in terms of capturing the moment in history when America finally began to assert her own unique voice in the visual arts, but it does boast many glorious images.<br />Maybe this book is nothing more than a glorified coffee table book, but what a fine, colorful one it is. The book is crammed full of beautiful reproductions of some of the finest work America's shores ever produced: Stella, Johns, Pollock, O'Keefe, Lawrence, Benton, Hopper and Calder all recieve detailed representation.<br />Being personally obsessed with the art of the Depression, I particularly valued the long, detailed chapter contained here.<br />Many hours have evaporated as I have lost myself in the many rich reproductions. This book, when enjoyed in union with Robert Hughes' excellent &quot;American Visions&quot; (which supplies the much needed rich prose), serves as a fine celebration of America's visual culture. A fine addition to any library.	2003-01-09

Written in 1965, when it was still fashionable to portray the Native American as a \\"in the way savage\\", Berger deftly blended the genres of tall tale and history in a manner that really has yet to be matched.<br />The character of Jack Crabb is cut of classic cloth. His story may very well be pure hogwash, but it is filled with touching humanity that underpins all the comedy. Berger portrays The Cheyenne people, or the \\"Human Beings\\" as possessing many of the same foibles and warts as their European counterparts. They are not painted as noble savages as in Blake's new agey work, but rather as complex characters deserving of respect and honor.<br />Berger's General Custer is a wry study of madness that somehow avoids cynicism. One of this book's many virtues lies in its ability to lend the Western myth a critical eye, while avoiding the nihilistic pessimism that frequently goes hand in hand with such work (something the film version couldn't avoid).<br />\\"Little Big Man\\" is a must read to all who love good yarns spun with a big heart and a bigger mind.	2003-01-06

Which is fitting as The Who often shared the same faults. Marsh does everything he possibly can to don the cloak of The Who and write as though he was one of them. <br />I agree with other reviewers in criticising the book's overall veracity. But that really is a small matter as &quot;Before I Get Old&quot; frequently is as entertaining as the group it documents.<br />Pete Townsend certainly is one of the few geniuses Rock music has produced. &quot;Before I Get Old&quot; certainly works extremely hard at presenting Townsend as Rock's All Father, a mantel Townsend himself worked very hard to develop. As a result, Townsend often comes off a real prententious jerk. But God, what great music he and his band mates produced out of their many disputes.<br />Marsh works hard at praising the contributions of Daltrey, Entwhistle and of course the incomparable Moon the Loon in producing some of the finest music Rock could ever hope to produce (boy, that was an arrogant statement- see the book rubs off. Marsh also never loses the fact that he is first and foremost a rabid fan. Maybe that is the book's biggest weakness, maybe it is the book's biggest strength. Marsh builds the case that The Who were the greatest Rock and Roll group of all time. An opinion I share (The Beatles are in a class all by them selves). He also makes the case that The Who really died with Keith Moon.<br />&quot;Before I Get Old&quot; is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it will do until we get the definitive work. As is, this is a blast to read.	2003-01-05

It is not as unbiased as it would like to portray itself as and it certainly holds more clarity when illustrated Christianity, Islam and Judiasm. Granted, it may be my personal perspective, but I found the areas of Eastern Religion somewhat convoluted and rushed.<br />That said, \\"The Religions of Man\\" while out of print and really surface level in its discussions, serves as a helpfull, simple introduction to a few of the world's great religions. Let one know that there is absolutely no substitute for reading the scriptures of the various faiths and beliefs, Smith's work does indeed bait the hook of interest. Worth seeking out and reading. Not a classic, but helpful non the less.	2003-01-01

Interviewing many of the survivors, Sides paints a vivid picture of a historical fact that unfortunately many have forgotten about. The POW experience proved a most horrible experience to all who suffered, especially in the Pacific Theatre. My generation owes a great debt to the brave men (and women!- &quot;Ghost Soldiers&quot; portrayes the often forgotten role women paid in the struggle for freedom)who paid such a terrible price. Sides animates this unfortunate chapter in human history with brilliant clarity and dramatic description. A most worthy addition to the canon of World War II historical documentation.

It also touches upon the audience and the very society that spawns and supports an art form that is sadly beginning to quite literally die off. <br />Cohen possesses both the journalist's objective eye and the lover's passionate heart. It is so very obvious that she holds a great deal of respect and admiration for her subjects as they attempt to mount a production of \\"M. Butterfly\\". It could be too easy for a person of Miss Cohen's background and experience to use condescending language, but she avoids those traps completely.<br />This is a loving portrait of theatre people for theatre people.	2002-09-06

Personally, being largely ignorant (sadly, like most Americans) of the region's complex history (except for the sound byte obsessed mainstream media), I am most thankful for Friedman's book.

Working in concert with the passionate objectivity of Alex Haley, Malcom X creates an articulate self portrait that breathes with anger, despair, hope, hunger and ultimately love. Malcom's story of self education and the heroic journey of evolution and transformation is a story for all people that transcends, race (I'm white), gender (I'm a male), class (I'm certainly rural middle class), and religion (I'm a protestant). It is about the power of language and the power of the supernatural (God, Allah, Jehovah, etc.) actively striking a lightening bolt into the temporal. Malcom holds nothing back and provides the reader with complete and total access to his soul, warts and all. It is most certainly not for the faint of heart or the thin of skin. This book galvanizes the reader to actively become a warrior against evil in all its forms. It forces a complete and total overhaul of personal bias, prejudice and values. It also allows the reader to see (hopefully) his/her own journey and need for spirtual electricity coupled with public action. Simply put, this is one of the great novels of the 20th (or for that matter, any) century.	2002-08-28

The production closed on May 18 2002.<br />\\"Careful, if you breathe, it breaks.\\" Laura<br />\\"The play is memory, and being a memory play, it is sentimental, it is dimly lit, it is not realistic.\\"<br />both quotes from The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams<br />\\"I'd always heard that your entire life flashes in front of you the second before you die. First off, that second isn't a second at all. It stretches on forever like an ocean of time . . . you have no idea what I\\"m talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry .. . you will.\\"<br />Lester from American Beauty written by Alan Ball<br />Brian Friel's gentle and poetic narrative seeks to capture the fragile and imperceptible line standing between nostalgia and history. \\"Dancing At Lughnasa\\" does not seek to be a documentary. It is not based so much on harsh reality as say McCourt's \\"Angela's Ashes\\". <br />The six adult siblings as viewed through the retrospective eyes of the adult narrator Micheal all share the common bond of blood, time and space. Their collective sense of love, compassion and interdependence makes them, I believe true heroes. In every family, there comes a time when the unit must break apart and each member must find their own independent way. the struggle against inevitable change, while it may appear foolish to some, I find admirable in the poetic sense. This struggle appears to provide the family with a history, a sense of place and purpose. Ultimately they find thier identity within the bird's nest ( in Friel's play, the hen house). The family also serves as the proving found. It defines, strengthens and completes its members. Perhaps in history before the radio of Marconi, the family found itself able to sustain and even thrive in one place.<br />Friel appears to use Dancing At Lughnasa as a vehicle for freezing in memory the final time before a family splinters off.<br />Memory often proves a decietful beast. Frequently we all remember things as we wish them to exist. This almost always contrasts with the factual. Micheal (Friel's alter ego) desires to hold this specific moment in time the way he wants to remember it, as an idealized image forever frozen in glass. Who really can blame us (and Micheal) for favoring nostalgia over fact? For like some sort of cruel trick, we amost never realize our key life events until long after they have played out.<br />The play's earthy philosopher Maggie even states, \\"just one quick glimpse-that's all you ever get. And if you miss that . . .\\" Dancing At Lughnasa serves as Friel's quick glimpse at a moment long gone.<br />Lughnasa is not a play of simple entertaiment. It is a complex work of art, filled with personal revelations, symbols and ideas that work together to reveal universe. It is a great play because it holds up to close reading and scrutiny. Enjoy and savor.	2002-05-21

This, perhaps one of the finest histories ever written about WWII, tells the story of the front line soldier from the first person.<br />Long before Saving Private Ryan inspired Tom Brokaw and the rest to capitalize on the rightfully named \\"Greatest Generation\\", Cambell and Leinbaugh's book captured the harrowing narrative of combat that so many men of that era are sadly taking to the grave with them. This book personlizes the story in a voice that appears to have been culled from a combat veteran reunion. The Men of Company K willingly recountsthe horror of battle as a permanent record. A warning really as to what freedom ultimately costs. May we be damned should we ever forget.<br />As a historical document, it boils in as much action and tension as any Clancy novel.<br />Ambrose frequently has used The Men of Company K as a carefully cited reference in his longer works.

That is always a prerequisite for embarking on a biographical journey. However, Voss' fandom does get in his way frequently as he unsuccessfully confuses is goal: is he a fan or a critic. This is really a small matter as the book does provide a fascinating insight into William Inge, a man whose private nature makes him a shadowy enigma at best.<br />Even almost thirty years after his death, Voss (writing in 1988), finds it very difficult to focus on Inge's personal life. The book doesn't provide as effective an insight into the writing process or into the man's inter workings as say Leverich's recent biography of Tennessee Williams has. This is due in no small part to the simple but important fact most of Inge's surviving friends and family didn't really know him.<br />This leaves Voss with little choice but to focus on the work.<br />Voss  makes it apparent that reading a biography of Inge is ultimately anti climatic as the thin layer of fiction in his work barely covers its ultimately autobiographical quality. Anyone who has read, watched or produced Inge's work will immediately recognize the forms, characters and language and situations relfected in his life. Voss proves most successful in drawing, enhancing and exploring those connections. This holds especially as the older,increasingly cynical and bitter Inge attempts to answer his critics (especially Robert Brustein!) and create plays reflective of the volatile 1960's and early 1970's. His latter plays failed perhaps because Inge tried to write outside of his strengths. Watching his bittersweet portraits of midwestern life crumble to dark and violent scenes of depravity really does fill the reader with a sense of sadness and loss. William Inge, like many great artists, decomposed in front of an audience.<br />Voss does admit that perhaps while Inge was not a great playwright in the sense he did not revolutionize the form as Brecht, Beckett, Odets, Williams, Miller and Wilder did, he did possess an uncanny ability to capture realistic dialouge.<br />Inge's sepia toned portraits of midwestern manners and life have been overshadowed by the canon of Williams, Miller and O'Neil to be sure. Voss makes the successful case that Inge stands as a proud equal to the more illuminary authors of America's rich dramatic tradition.<br />A fine read well worth the time and effort about a fine literary artist desperately in need of rediscovering. Even if it doesn't know whether it is a biography or critical evaluation.sed in front of an audience.<br />Voss does admit that perhaps while Inge was not a great playwright in the sense he did not revolutionize the form as Brecht, Beckett, Odets, Williams, Miller and Wilder did, he did possess an uncanny ability to capture realistic dialouge.<br />Inge's sepia toned portraits of midwestern manners and life have been overshadowed by the canon of Williams, Miller and O'Neil to be sure.

This is not to suggest that dirt digging would a better book make, simply that bringing such points up need, I feel fleshing out. Unlike McCullough, Amrose and Ellis, the Ungers aren't quite as successful as building, in a one volume form, the broader historical and cultural spectrum for LBJ. The book certainly needs a touch of \\"the bigger picture\\".<br />This criticism aside, LBJ certainly works as a fine introduction to a complex man who was a gifted politician who possessed an uncanny ability to forge bipartisian coalitions to pass a great many pieces of legislation. Were it not for the inherited morass of Vietnam, the Ungers suggest that history could have been much kinder to the man from Texas. <br />The LBJ as portrayed in this book is a driven man plagued by many contradictions, least of all his oscillation between depression and doubt and victory and satisfaction. <br />LBJ as book, despite its overall \\"Reader's Digest\\" feel, does introduce Johnson to a new generation. A solid read.	2002-02-28

Kingdom Come is the first graphic novel I have purchased in well over 20 years (note that I did not say comic book).<br />I found myself completely enthralled by Alex Ross' absolutely brilliant illustrations. Ross is a visual artist who's work gloriously recalls the great illustrators from the past. With this work, Ross proudly joins the ranks of folks like Frazetta, Wyeth(!) and maybe even Fredric Remington in his sense of drama, framing and colorful rendering.<br />Waid's script is full of all the wonderfully geeky self important and self conscious hyperbole and ploting that makes illustrated novels so fun to read. I especially appreciated Waid and Ross' full realization that America's canon of superheroes is very much a part of world mythology and legend. Superman, Wonder Woman (I love Ross' depiction of this uber-Tuetonic sex goddess. Gone are the overtones of lesbianism and all too present is WW's athletic sexuality) are depicted here as gods on earth, worthy of addition to Valhalla and Mt. Olympus.<br />Warner Brothers would be wise to employ Ross and Waid as screenwriters and designers to resurrect their moribound Batman franchise.<br />Part of a graphic novel, or escapist film's lure has always been its ability to serve as a ticket to another place. Kingdom Come successfully transports the reader to an often frightening, ultimately heroic and always colorfully exciting and captivating alternative universe.<br />Kingdome Come is the graphic novel for folks who don't usually read graphic novels.	2001-11-08

But understand that he (Wolfe) gives a real East Coast version of what was essentially a West Coast phenomenon.&quot;<br />What I think that means essentialy validates many of the other positive reviews of this book: Wolfe uncannily possesses the ability to be &quot;in the Pranster's world, but not of it&quot;.<br />This means that while Wolfe is fully willing and able to passionately incorperate the unique linguistic acrobatics of Kesey and the Pranksters in relating the narrative, he maintains somehow a cool, objective distance from all the proceedings. Kesey might be saying that while Wolfe was certainly &quot;on the bus&quot;, he was never &quot;ON THE BUS!&quot;. <br />This distance is communicated and maintained by Wolfe's refusal to judge the shennanigans. He never really says &quot;yay&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; to the invention of the &quot;counter culture&quot; (whatever in the hell that means). He relates the consequences both natural and man-made that befalls on such behavior, but never comes out from behind the page and says &quot;booh!&quot;<br />He wisely leaves all moral judgement in the place where it rightly belongs: in the hearts and minds of the readers.<br />It is not a book for the weak of back, heart or mind. It will challenge the reader as well as entertain for Wolfe pulls no punches and that is a treatment most appropriate for the Hemingway-esque machismo frat boy jock mentality that underlies all of Kesey's art.  <br />The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is a excellent example of brilliant reporting. It combines stunning writing with cool logic and impassioned empathetic distance. This is a must read.	2001-11-08

Above and beyond the demonization and canonization . . . before the scandals, successes and defeats . . . lay the strong personality possessed by a Falstaffian hunger for the love, acceptance, and power the celebrity of politics can provide.<br />Journalist Maraniss' possesses an uncanny ability to avoid all the hyberbole that has surrounded Clinton and cut to the facts and create a vibrant portrait of not just a man driven to succeed at all costs, but also of a generation seeking to find its place in history.<br />Maraniss' central thesis: that Clinton is the first representative of the Baby Boom Generation (and everything that statement implies) to enter the White House, forms a compelling historical tapestry on which to weave his narrative. <br />I've always valued in a biographical author, the ability to place the subject in the bigger picture and historical frame of reference and Maraniss proves most successful in this sense. He takes a great deal of time building the proper context in which to place the Clintons. Their collective rise to power is no accident. Neither is, in reading the book, their collective fall from Grace and relative political invincibility. They knew exactly how to tap into (and exploit) the collective unconsciousness of their generation.<br />First in His Class, also benefits from a most prudential editing. It really is tight in its narrative and commentary. Maraniss wastes very little in developing and defending his thesis. It is so refreshing to see an author remain so focused. Even his digressions develop his central vision.<br />This gets my vote as the best Clinton book thus far.	2001-10-23

Again my mantra about acting books remains . . .<br />Reading an acting book must be taken inside the context of personal experience of either production or an acting class.<br />I value Checkov for the simple reason that, although he often comes across as nebulous and abstract, he stresses the fantastic and imaginative elements of acting.<br />Escewing working from the emotional inside out Checkov, a veteran of the Moscow Art Theatre, stresses finding the character through imaginative excercises that first engage the external elements of the actor's instrument namely in the creation of fantasy atmospheres and communion with the audience.<br />Building upon Jung's theories of the Universal Archetype, I find Checkov's bit about the psychological gesture and &quot;living statues&quot;  most helpful in teaching, acting and directing. <br />In a professional world where gut wrenching, self absorbed displays of therepy induced emotion passes for true acting, I find Checkov's teachings most helpful in inspiring the true reasons many find themselves drawn to the stage: the wonder and excitement of telling an imaginative story.	2001-10-18
US	51210820	R3N84CQQ9XULX9	157322751X	144250243	Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Fascinating, controversial, not gospel!	Actually, if possible I would rate this book 3 1/2 stars. It's good, frequently very good, but just slightly short of great. Anyway . . . When reading this in depth, fascinating personal testimonial of Shakespeare's unique, total and complete genius it becomes most appropriate that Bloom values (along with Hamlet) Falstaff as the consumate Shakespearean invention. Bloom (self admittedly) frequently comes across as a wise, worldly, self depricating, verbose, comical, passionate, and over educated Falstaffian windbag. This is not to suggest that Bloom isn't fascinating, he truly is, it is just that he is so reverential of subject, he ironically often loses the essence of the world's finest author. To quote Gratiano from &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, if the world is Shakespeare to Bloom then . . . &quot;You (Bloom) have too much respect upon the world, they loose it that do buy it with much care.&quot; As an author, Bloom lets loose with epic verbal pyrotechnics that are most worthy of &quot;so great an object&quot;. It is refreshing and exciting to find a erudite scholar willing to shatter the ivory tower and loosen up his pen to wildly paint on the eternal canvas that is Shakespearean criticism. Bloom's central thesis is a compelling one to say the least: that more than any other author in world history, Shakespeare is responsible for creating the modern (and contemporary) notion of the human being. By exploring all of Shakespeare's plays (and fixating upon Hamlet and the role of Falstaff) Bloom methodically, passionately and with a generous amount of pomposity, vigorously defends his thesis. However, my major criticism against Bloom is based upon by strong personal bias against the over intellectualization and complete canonization (but rightfully so) of The Bard. Bloom (building upon the earlier work of Charles Lamb), repeatedly states that Shakespeare best works as a read text. He says that the stage is not the appropriate venue for pure resonance because most productions fall far short of Shakespeare's glory. In other words, Bloom certainly displays a disdain for most theatrical excursions. As an actor, director and teacher, while I agree that many productions do indeed fall short, I believe that Shakespeare comes to life in a live production. Shakespeare never intended to be studied, read and worshiped. He wrote to be performed. To live and resound in the gonads, the fingertips, the heart and the gut in the great symbiosis of the live theatre. That as a writer he appeals to the entire body and soul of the audience is truly a testament to his greatness. And what has killed Shakespeare is the all too frequent reverance bestowed upon him. Yes, he is the greatest author of all time, but he is on one hand nothing more than a playwright. But that pathetic soapboxing aside, Bloom does successful argue that no one owns Shakespeare. Not just actors, nor academics nor even the profiteers. Shakespeare is for all of us because he is all of us. I thank Bloom for writing such a fun read that transcends the dull academia that so often prevails in like works. Enjoy this book, but more importantly enjoy the plays.	2001-08-28
US	51210820	R31T9MAQCEKQGD	0394555082	642527170	Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Ultimately a dissappointment	I was drawn to this biography largely for two reasons: Morris' previous work and my fascination with the enigma and person of Ronald Reagan. Morris has proven ( especially his work on Teddy Roosevelt which is a must read!) to be an author who not only carefully researchs his subject but also renders his narratives with a hand fully capable of impressible verbal dexterity.<br />In &quot;Dutch:A Memoir of Ronald Reagan&quot;, Morris continues to display his many great talents. BUT . . . <br />. . . although I respect his artistic license with the fictitious first person narrator (and Morris follows in a long line of authors who have successfully utilized such a convention), it simply doesn't work for me.<br />The presence of the contrived voice immediately aroused in me questions of Morris' validity. While it is obvious that Morris has continued his uncanny ability to collect, examine, reflect, and expand upon a great many facts gained through years of painfully detailed research, the conventions of fiction simply made it very difficult for me as a reader to filter out the facts.  In building, as all successful biographers must, the wider frame of historical reference, Morris has to spend pages building his imagined narrator's backstory. Because I was constantly having to differentiate between the apparently imagined world and the historic in these digressions, I found this book a far too exhausting and frustrating read.<br />Granted, perhaps that is Morris' final point, that he found himself unable to cut through the battle in Reagan's life between the imagined and the real to paint a compellingly personal portrait. I admit that Morris' literary choices are an admirable tactic to overcome such a daunting obstacle to: &quot;Bring Forth So Great An Object.&quot; <br />It is just as a reader, I like to keep my fiction and my history seperated. At least as much as possible.	2001-08-01

There is a fine broad range of pieces ranging from the comic to the serious. And of course, there is a wide range of quality. Some scenes are fantastic (Strange Snow, The Nerd, Laundry and Bourbon) and others wretched (you be the judge). Obviously there is absolutely no substitute for reading the entire play, but often in the face of an acting class, time is of the essence.<br />However a warning I would give out is for all High School Acting teachers. Learning from experience, please understand that many of the scenes are racy and salty in their content. That is just a heads up for teachers wishing to build a scene study library-which this certainly belongs. You don't necessarily have to censor, you just have to be aware.	2001-06-11
US	51210820	R1BAQKYPSZBWVW	0684829576	462878472	The Empty Space: A Book About the Theatre: Deadly, Holy, Rough, Immediate	Books	5	30	33	N	N	The theatre as a living organism	Building upon the earlier work of Aristotle, Brecht, Artaud and others, Brook confronts the living organism of the theatre on four levels: Deadly, Holy, Rough and Immediate. In each level, Brook makes the case that the theatre is not only a necessary component to the human creature, but a being that despite its constant wounds and ills, manages to bounce up from the death bed and find a way to survive.<br />Interestingly when Brook was writing (1968) there were many cynical critics who complained that the theatre was dying in the wake of television and film. Brook confronts the issue that theatre attendance was reacing all time lows. Today, over thirty years later, it is daunting to consider that there are even more distractions (the internet, home video, etc.) and attendance is even lower still. Yet despite these imposing knives thrusting into the communal body that is the Theatre, the world's oldest art form manages to forge ahead, survive and, the rare cases, thrive all the while maintaining its cultural importance.<br />Brook believes the theatre is unique is that it requires a community of artists and audiences alike to exist. That very sense of humanity and awe is what allows it to flourish in many instances.<br />Brook's writing is admittedly erudite and sometimes pretentious. And perhaps when one takes the positions that he does, such lofty language and posings may indeed be impossible. I hate to say it, but Brook's book may be hard going for the theatre lay person- God knows I'm aware of how elitist that sounds, but I think it is true. Because of his thick verbage, it may take a couple of stabs for the reader to unlock Brook's fevered soapboxing. But the journey is well worth the price.<br />This is a book of theatre theory and therefore it may appear quite barren of practical solutions. However when read in conjunction with not only life experience in the theatre as well as the many great acting, directing and play wrighting texts, it does provide the theatre artist with the basis for forging a true political manifesto. To quote Brook himself, &quot;To play needs much work. But when we experience the work as play, then it is not work any more. A play is a play.&quot;	2001-06-11
US	51210820	R3RVLABODOSQM3	0553272950	779993029	Audition	Books	5	79	82	N	N	A most critical must read	Whether one is an actor, director, writer or teacher, Shurtleff's book is simply a critical must read. Shurtleff who spent many years as a top casting director possessed an absolute love for the brave souls who dare to place themselves on the stage. His ultimate legacy to his beloved craft is this indispensable &quot;How To&quot; bible.<br />Much has been written already about his twelve guideposts, and I have nothing new to add to those already glowing (and well deserved) comments. What I did find most illuminative and refreshing is his comments on how to behave at the job interview. It is in this chapter that this book becomes helpful to even the non actor. In this chapter/section, Shurtleff urges all people to realize that ultimately the pressure in the job interview is on the employer and that a good prospect will immediately put the interview board at ease. All too often actors become so self centered and fail to realize that their performance is really about their audience, not them. The same is true therefore of the job interview. It is about the employer, not the employee.<br />As a teacher, Audition has been most helpful to me as it has provided objective certainty to an area filled with far too many  subjective judgements. In other words, Shurtleff has helped define the skills and tasks necessary to train actors in a manner that will help them transition successfully from the educational venue to the professional market. He has given us  clear, active objectives to teach toward. <br />In Audition, Shurtleff articulates what constitutes good, effective acting. Once that becomes defined clearly, then success becomes not a nebulous ideal, but rather a concrete proposition. <br />If this is not in your theatre library, it is time you add it now.	2001-06-07

Gordon Liddy	Books	5	4	7	N	N	Not a whitewashed autobiography	An inherent question that frequently nags away at the reader of the autobiography is the issue of validity. All too frequently autobiographies are ghost written white washes of the specific subject's character and views.<br />This is certainly not the case with Liddy. He lets the reader decide for themselves whether he is a psychopath or a visionary. He neither asks for nor receives any quarter for his actions and life choices. One can hear Liddy quoting the Who throughout the book: &quot;I don't need to be forgiven.&quot;<br />Liddy is a man who has cast himself in his own action adventure story and whether or not the specific stories are true, his impressions of them are so articulately drawn that the reader gains complete and total access into the inner workings of Liddy's mind- however terrifying that may be. As one reads the book, it becomes increasingly apparent that Liddy honestly and competely believes every word. His voice and word choice is consistant and resonant. Because of Liddy's candor, &quot;Will&quot; actually may be closer to psychological thriller than autobiography.<br />Certainly of all the players in the Watergate scandal, Liddy comes off as the most candid. He feels there is nothing to hide. This is ironic when one considers Liddy's lust for all things secretive and devious.<br />&quot;Will&quot; is a page turning memoir of a sickly child, who transfixed and mesmorized by Hitler and the cult of the Alpha-Male, transformed himself into a self made (and self described) Nietzchian (and Malchavalian!) Superman. After all, this is the man who made his entire office staff watch Leni Reifenstahl's Valentine to the Nazi Party &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; as inspiration.<br />Writing teachers struggle painfully with passing on the technique of &quot;Voice&quot; to their subjects. Present in this excellent read is a perfect example of &quot;Voice&quot;. &quot;Will&quot; may be one of the best popular insights into the inner workings of psychopath (uh-oh, I let my judgement of Liddy's character seep out ) available.h-oh, I let my judgement of Liddy's character seep out ) available.	2001-06-04

A great irony, while reading several of the negative criticisms of Hirsch's controversial position, occurs when one considers that these critics would simply be unable to attack without being the embodiment of Hirsch's central postion: that reaching the higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy requires a set body of knowledge. Analyzing, synthesizing and evaluating information is literally impossible without first knowing, comprehending and applying.<br />A fine example is in the medical profession where the first year focuses narrowly on the rote memorization of the body. Without a set knowledge (knowing) of anatomy and the related maladies it is impossible to make effective diagnosis (analyzing, synthesizing, evaluating).<br />As an educator I have experienced first hand the industry driven mandate to produce a more effective group of critical and creative thinkers. In the process we have tragically discovered that such an endeavor is impossible without first teaching content. The kernal of Hirsch's position is that critical and creative thinking are absolutely intertwined with specific content. We as educators, parents and members of society are cheating our children and our futures if we fail to mutually and communaly provide a central frame of reference (or schema). Without such a frame of reference, contribution to and therefore extension of our culture will become but a distant memory.<br />We have been asked to focus upon the process of guess and go and the cult of the &quot;How did you arrive at that solution?&quot; over the precise &quot;what are we putting into their heads&quot;. This is of course saying nothing of the cult of the self esteem. The result? I have seen the result as manifested in declining test scores, a rise of self absorbtion and an ever narrowing of world awareness. <br />Hirsch is not an elitist, in fact he strongly asserts (repeatedly) that it is indeed providing all students (and one of the beautiful facts of American Public Education is that &quot;All&quot; means ALL) with the same basic frame of reference enables them to take control over their lives and contribute actively as producers as opposed to passive consumers.<br />Having a common base of knowledge unites us all and crosses all boundries. It is that common fram of reference that defines our culture and truly creates a pluralistic society.<br />Hirsch provides plenty of qualitative and quantitative evidence to support his postion. His Bibliography and related sources are also most helpful.<br />Coming from a state that uses a prescribed reading assessment, I found his analysis of a reading selection describing Lee's surrender at Appomattox most illustrative of the need for more content based education. Hirsch and his fellow researchers found that the test takers were not able to construct (higher levels of Bloom) a great amount meaning due to their ignorance of even a basic knowlege of the American Civil War.<br />As an acting teacher, I have found that the individuals who have the greater knowledge of history, art, literature and general culture are able to produce far more nuanced and complete peformance. There is no way to stage a compelling play set during World War II without first researching the period.  <br />Where Hirsch has drawn the most criticism is in his list (fleshed out in greater detail in his equally fascinating &quot;Dictionary of Cultural Literacy&quot;). In this list, Hirsch prescribes what he defines as the core knowledge. And of course any time someone goes out on a limb to make such a proclimation, there will be great holes (I believe Steinbeck is far more important - he isn't listed- than Norman Mailer - he is). But at least, Hirsch provides a starting point for creating specific curriculumn. Again, attacking Hirsch's critics, how does one know what isn't on the list if they haven't first learned that concept.<br />At any rate, whether one will agree with Hirsch or disagree, &quot;Cultural Literacy&quot; is a must read.	2001-05-31

McCullough posseses an uncanny knack at making elevated political figures human in all the right sense. John Adams comes off as being that rarest of human animals, (sadly at least in the contemporary mind) an American political figure who truly is a renaissance man. It is all too easy to forget and trivilize the extreme high stakes Adams and the other founding fathers were playing for. <br />In reading McCullough's latest book, I do not get the full sense of sweeping tapestry as I did with his other works. There is much in the book that appears to be missing. McCullough does however include a most helpful bibliography in his research that inspires me to search further into the era.<br />And perhaps that is McCullough's greatest contribution. Like the other great pop historian, Stephen Ambrose, McCullough inspires the reader to continue on beyond his immediate material and celebrate history through personal investigation. &quot;John Adams&quot; for the beginner (in this case me), serves as a most effective starting point for a journey into the invention of a nation. Keep up the excellent work Mr. McCullough.	2001-05-29

Cormac McCarthy combines these gothic horror elements with the &quot;Tale of the Wandering Jew&quot; to craft a novel that, while certainly a genre western in the classic sense (it is filled with outlaws, pioneers, gunfights, horses, etc.) manages to also defy catergorization.<br />This is not a novel for all readers. McCarthy is an aquired taste. The hope through regeneration and purgation is present but certainly takes a close reading to discover. I am not a fan of dark literature per se, but McCarthy posseses such a unique linguistic style, that he indeed weaves a magic tapestry around his narratives and seduces the reader. He also manages to breathe new life into a classic American genre by throwing a new spin at his audience.<br />Like the rest of McCarthy's novels, &quot;Outer Dark&quot; is on one hand extremely cinematic with its rich and dense imagery and yet completely unfilmable. In fact Jim Jarmasch's excellent but aquired taste &quot;Dead Man&quot; contains many scenes that could have been taken directly from &quot;Outer Dark&quot;. <br />As with all westerns, McCarthy devotes a large portion of his storytelling to creating a vivid landscape. The natural world according to McCarthy is wide, expansive and filled with great dread and danger. The Wilderness is not a place for the meek- they do not get to inherit the earth according to McCarthy. His view is extremely Old Testement in that regard. The wild expanses of the undeveloped country is, in of itself a scourge angel where wickedness is to be purged.<br />&quot;Outer Dark&quot; is at times a difficult read. For those brave souls willing to take a chance on a risky work of art, I whole heartedly reccomend this unique novel.	2001-05-17

The towering and beautiful fragile characters of his plays combined with his devotion to the utter magic the physical theatre provides, allowed America through Tennessee Williams to finally place itself rightly next to Ibsen, Strinberg, Chekov and The Bard himself.<br />Of course &quot;Tom&quot; did not develop in a vacume and what Leverich provides here in this excellent biography wrapped in the guise of a psychological thriller worthy of so great an object, is a portrait of a man often crippled by acute sensitivity who saw the writing muse as a means for survival. Leverich manages to paint the man behind the myth, bring him down into a real space and time while also managing to lift him to the angels.<br />This is one of the greatest biographies ever written about a theatre artist- of which Williams was a supreme being. I, and many others, eagerly await volume two.	2001-05-15

Dickey apparently believes Darwin was right in interpreting nature's rules to be: only the strong organism survives.<br />The four main characters serve as contemporary archetypes for contemporary American society. <br />Lewis is the uber-macho hunter eager to see the &quot;system&quot; fail so he can have the opportunity to live by his physique. He is sincere in his devotion to &quot;the strenuous life&quot;, but Dickey will not allow us to depend on the traditional warrior to provide the food and the protection. It is our job.<br />Bobby is the overweight, vulgar super consumer who has, through the process of evolution, mangaged to remove all vestiges of the savage hunter from his being. He has become far too accustomed to feeding off the bounty harvested from the rape of the natural world (boy howdy is he in for an ironic table turning!). His soft white underbelly is ripe for the attack as he is incapable (at least in the beginning) of producing any physical threat. His job is to let his talking do the action.<br />Drew is the idealist who believes in the purity and gentle aesthetics of the forest. He is one who has probably commited &quot;Walden Pound&quot; and The Constitution to memory. It is he who believes in Democracy and decency. In many ways he is Jimmy Stewart in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; reincarnated.<br />And finally there is our bland (this, I believe is Dickey's purposefull intention) narrator, the commercial artist Ed who is a blank slate. Like &quot;The Call of The Wild's&quot; 'Buck' (I strongly encourage all to re-read Jack London's aforemention book in conjunction with Deliverance- the similarities are astounding!), it is Ed who must progress (evolve) by retrogressing. It is he who I believe becomes the reader's persona and ultimately the story is about Ed's Deliverance. And ours. Perhaps. <br />Like William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, Dickey seems to suggest that while facing the roaring river and her inhabitants, morality is, to quote London &quot;a luxury one can ill afford in the wild.&quot; Morality and law after all are not commodities traded in nature's open market.<br />Like the river itself, Deliverance is beautiful, savage, and ever flowing toward an inevitable (but suprising!) conclusion. It is not for the faint of heart, but for those looking for a good read containing prose crafted by an expert marksman, Deliverance is a great novel well worth your time. A classic.	2001-05-08

Since the interview, by its very nature is limited in its scope and focus, &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; simply does not possess the depth of Campbell's other work. <br />This really is no matter as what is present provides the reader with a fine introduction to Campbell's passionate devotion to World Myth. Campbell's life thesis, that man posseses the innate desire and need to create myth, is a compelling idea the binds us all to ourselves and each other.<br />&quot;The Power of Myth&quot; is NOT to be taken as a religious tome. In that context, it certainly does come off as a cockeyed New Age concoction of non-commitment. It is meant, however, to be taken as a work of deconstructionist literary criticsm that seeks to celebrate the common threads running through all cultures and perspectives.<br />Campbell openly celebrates man's ability to imagine as well as his devotion to ideas. He does not seek to debunk or trivialize the devout (one must be careful to realize this as they read Campbell). His scholarly intent as I see it, is to encourage and nurture the seed of faith inherent in all and encourage everyone to embark on their own heroic adventures of discovery.<br />&quot;The Power of Myth&quot; serves as an excellent bibliography of sorts as it lists the many great folktales and religious texts which demand re-reading. Campbell urges his audience to read for themselves and search for their own discoveries. <br />If one is searching for a far more in depth study of myth, I cannot praise enough Campbell's excellent &quot;The Hero With A Thousand Faces&quot;. As is, &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; is a fine starting point.	2001-05-05

Granted it took me two attempts in a span of ten+ years to finally appreciate Faulkner's dense prose, ever shifting verb tense and point of view, but once I agreed to place myself fully into his expert hands did his rich talent captivate me. It was well worth the wait.<br />A great novel for me must meet at least one of not all of a few simple criteria:<br />1) does it tell a great story that is both entertaining and illuminative of the human condition?<br />2) does it allow me to connect its world with my own experience?<br />3) does it tell its story in such a way that it can't be translated into another medium without severe and drastic omitions and changes- thereby making it unique in terms of form.<br />Obviously I have several other criteria, but &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; meets and/or exceeds all three.<br />Buried in the deceptively simple story of a rural Southern family funeral ritual, is a narrative that sheds light into the critical issue of death and dying. Faulkner demystifies Death while managing still to maintain shrouds of secrecy. My own encounters with the Grim one have been made far more survivable and less terrifying since reading this novel.<br />By telling his story from a variety of points of view, Faulkner creates a story that is as valid as it is wise. Each character, despite their shifting intellects and ages adds their own unique slant to the proceedings thereby making a vibrant quilt.<br />As the book stands, there is absolutely no way to adapt it into a film and that makes Faulkner's work all the more unique. He is daring his readers to experience the story not necessarily on his terms, but rather on the characters' themselves. This makes for a storytelling experience not possible in either the theatre or the cinema. Perhaps with this and his other novels, Faulkner was getting back at Hollywood for wastinghis talent. It is almost as he is saying &quot;Bugger off, I can make something far different than your product!&quot; Faulkner has achieved revenge, his books are his, they can never be properties waiting to be developed by meddling hands.<br />He, through his characters and settings, desires to speak directly to the reader without any interlopers- the mark of a great writer.<br />&quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; is a unique reading experience that I encourage all to undertake (no pun intended- necessarily).	2001-05-05

With the exception (at least in my mind) of The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell To Arms and For Whom The Bell Tolls (The Old Man And the Sea, although great is overrated at the same time), the tension and economy of line required of the short story form became muddled as Hem tackled the novel.<br />Although this collection is not complete- missing here are two of my favorite Nick Adams stories- it definately contains Hemingway's finest work. My personal favorite, amoung many many choices included here is both parts of &quot;Big Two Hearted River&quot;. Although I am not a fly fisherman, I am a human being and Nick's sense of loss and reflection as it becomes manifested in the wilderness resounds beautifully.<br />Hemingway is often Thoreau with out the self consciousness.<br />In re-reading these stories it continued to amaze me how utterly accessible and entertaining Hemingway's short stories remain to this day and how utterly dry, academic and pretentious all the &quot;scholarship&quot; has tried to make him in the unsufferable Lit classes I have often endured.<br />Hemingway is a great story teller who relates simple narratives that sensually create a spiritual experience. His line of action is clear and devoid of any digression. His avoidance of psycho-babble (thank God he didn't live long enough to experience the 1970's!) and his desire to place things grounded in the reality of doing (actors can learn volumes from reading Hemingway) makes him truly timeless.<br />There are many great writers who write as if they were talking directly to the audience in a barroom or fireside chat. What I  find interesting about Hemingway is a strange void of &quot;talkiness&quot;. I never get the sense that he could easily be telling me this story as a dramatic monolouge. His style often manages to transcend spoken language and commune directly with the readers's experience through the written word. In that sense, he is a trueauthor using the written word as a full tool. <br />I discovered this while trying to adapt some of his short stories into a dramatic monolouge/performance pieces. Hemingway doesn't work as well as Faulkner, Steinbeck, Twain, Dylan Thomas or even Ken Kesey. There isn't an oral tradition stored up waiting to be unlocked in Hemingway's work. They are short stories not tall tales (deconstructionist/feminist/new age/PC/Multi-culti critics leave that last claim alone!)<br />Maybe that is why Hemingway hasn't really ever been successfully translated to the screen.<br />At any rate, these collected stories are not meant to be seen or heard, they are must reads. Enjoy and re-discover.	2001-05-05

The goal of all parents is ultimately to prepare their offspring to eventually step out into the world as independent and responsible adults themselves. As we all know, reaching that goal is a painful yet exhilarating process. Learning how and when to cut the apron strings is a lesson all parents must learn. This excellent parenting help book is a must read for all brave souls daring to raise children into adulthood.<br />Glenn and Nelson's book is an easy to read, jargon-free, practical, life affirming, and strengthening guide on how to raise children in a world that is drastically shifting from Production based to Consumer driven. It is becoming far too easy to raise children to be passive souls who fail to gain spiritual and ethical maturity who can make eductated decisions and accept the consequences of their actions.<br /> Glenn (a hyperactive child and adult himself!) lays out simple strategies and philosophies that do meld tough love with a tender and loving heart. Of all the parenting books we (my wife and I) have read, this has proven the most important and helpful to date as we have constantly returned to re-read many passages to gain reflective insight and know we are not alone in our convictions. A definate 5 out of 5 in a market flooded with too many pale and weak products.	2001-05-03

Books	5	12	13	N	Y	One of the best kept secrets of American Theatre	Eleemosynary - charatible, the giving of alms.<br />And so begins one of the real gems of the contemporary American Theatre written by perhaps the best home-grown playwrights to appear in the last 15 years.<br />In Eleemosynary playwright Lee Blessing, like he does in all his work, celebrates the joy of language and its intrinsic power to create storms of imagery. In this short, eliptical and direct play which demands a symbolic staging, Blessing gives us three generations of Westbrook women- a unique family blessed (and cursed) with supreme intelligence and eccentricity.<br />I have directed the play once and seen it staged several times and each encounter has proven fullfilling past expectation. It is poetic without pretension and it is charatible without resorting to maudlin posings. The matriarch of the clan- the bold Dorothea is so carefully drawn as is her daughter Artie and grandaughter Echo. Dorothea's eccentricities do not become shallow manipulations here (as say similar characters do in Steel Magnolies for example), and that truly is a testement to Blessings sublime mastery of language and space. Like all great plays, Eleemosynary touches the heart and the head at the same time as it is filled with laughs and tears.<br />Discover and savor this highly polished diamond!	2001-05-03

Obviously, it would be optimal if one could work in a workshop that put this book up on its feet. That way the teacher/director could experience many of these games and technique building excersises first hand, thereby making them even more vibrant and clear. <br />That said, this third edition is extremely practical, detailed and very clearly written as it lays out hundreds of excersises which build not only acting technique, but group integrity as well. Spolin was a gifted teacher and director and her nearly seventy years of experience in the theatre pays great dividends to all who dare to follow in her footsteps,<br />Even more helpful than the vast multitude of improvisational activities is her advice to the director of the scripted play. Like William Ball's A Sense of Direction (also a must have!) she stresses the importance of building the positive environment and details specific strategies on how to make it happen. <br />This is a phenomenal resource for all teachers, students, actors and directors.	2001-05-01

Danny Peary, a film fanatic himself, in these series of three books (I'm only dealing with the first in this review) gleefully, critically and passionately celebrates what makes film going the sheer pleasure that it is. In a series of well written, insightful, often humourous and always celebratory essays, Peary explores many classic, weird and wonderful films that raise the pulses of fans.<br />Many film texts are dry treatises that absolutely drain the rollercoaster vicseral joy that a film can bring. Not so with Peary's excellent series. Peary manages to legitimately relate the true art that is cinema while at the same time exploring what makes so many great films live as a part of our very extistances.<br />I have read and re-read this book several times and each time, I have discovered a new insight into a favorite film or been directed to a new reference point. Peary is very careful to point to other film scholars and film titles that can enhance a film cutlists experience. In deconstructing each film, he also includes fascinating tidbits of information such as interviews with the film makers, insights into the creative process and backstory history.<br />Especially fine are his explorations on &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;. He successfully argues in all those cases that superb entertainment does make great art.<br />Do I agree with every one of Peary's opinions? Do I enjoy every single film included in these three books? Of course not! But Peary does give vallidation to all of us who could be classified as true film geeks. Since these books are as of this writing all out of print, I with the strongest terms possible urge you all to seek them out. You will not be dissapointed!	2001-05-01
US	51210820	RQRMMA6JEEZF	068485256X	95652864	The Last Temptation of Christ	Books	4	8	11	N	N	An important novel that demands re-reading	I will certainly agree with many of the other reviewers who find this excellent novel ponderous and hard going in many, many places. I also believe too that with all translations there is much lost in terms of rhythym, imagery and cultural frame of reference.<br />That said, The Last Temptation of Christ demands not only attention, but re-reading as well- always the mark of a good book.<br />Kazantzakis never intended his novel to be taken as gospel. He simply is attempting to bring into focus the humanity at the center of the mystery of Christ. Christ, in my mind is the living God and Kazantzakis, through a work of fiction, brings Him as a character closer to my own experience. Again, no one is to take this novel as Truth in a religious sense- although Kazantzakis is not blasphemus as many of this novel's attackers insist- it simply is an exploration of the sin and heartache that all human's encounter.<br />By making Christ more human for the sake of narrative, Kazantzakis brings the price of our salvation even closer to reality. The pain of sin and blood of cleansing is even more critical and necessary to every one of us. Satan's tempting of Christ in this novel is so vividly powerful that we do indeed see our selves manifested. The book has demanded I (and all readers) re-examine and closely evaluate our faith. This does not mean we reject it- no- it actually makes our faith stronger.<br />Kazantzakis had the courage to step out of Plato's cave with this novel. I strongly urge all readers to tackle the difficult prose and wrestle with this novel. It is a meaningful journey one can (and needs to!) take repeatedly.	2001-05-01

That job is still yet to be done. While we do lose much of the poetry we are used to, Peterson does render the New Testament in a completely accessible form that frequently reads like a living and breathing contemporary novel. He should have employed a few more collaborators and editors on the work, but it is still an impressive achievement and a good read.<br />Should this be the only text one studies with? Of course not. But it does serve as a starting off point for one's religious exploration and study. &quot;The Message&quot; of Salvation through the living Christ rings loud and true in this new translation.<br />I do disagree with some of the negative reviewers. I certainly grasped in this translation, Christ's true divinity. I also grasped for the first time, a real sense of Paul and his position of doctrine and devotion. I reccomend the book not as an end all and be all, but as fine, accessible introduction.	2001-05-01

A fine writer, with an excellent command of the language, Medved confronts (at least in his thesis) Hollywood's blatant disregard for traditional American values.<br />Yes, Medved's thesis is simplistic and yes, he fails to consider the changing times which are indeed reflected in popular culture. And No, I as a reader certainly do not agree with all of Medved's points (Platoon is a far, far superior film to The Sands of Iwo Jima!). And I don't think everyone is supposed to agree with every point Medved desires to make. However, he does pose serious deconstructive questions that lend themselves well toward serious discourse and debate.<br />Popular Culture has now evolved to significance in our society, whether for well or ill, well beyond a relfective product. It does influence us as well. Medved is simply, in this book that's well worth a look, asking us to closely consider what that influence may be.	2001-04-23

Like all great authors, Kesey shows us the world outside the caves of our own existance and thereby illuminates and illustrates a vibrant world now becoming increasingly extinct.<br />Like Steinbeck's Joads, the Stamper family of &quot;Notion&quot; are victims of a rapidly disappearing history. The great forests that they work, grow and live and die in are (or have already) disappearing and yet they hold on, refusing to &quot;give an inch&quot;.<br />By shifting point of view and verb tense, Kesey paints his narrative on a broad canvas filled with fully drawn characters and settings. The fictitious town of Wakonda Oregon lives and breathes as an active organism, evolving and molding its citizens in spiritual as well as physical ways far beyond their control.<br />The novel is tragic as well as humourous. A great sequence in which the super Alpha male Hank Stamper debates modern Jazz with the effete half brother Lee is bizarre yet entertaining as it contrasts vividly with the extremely accurate depictions of forestry practices.<br />The book works on many, many levels. It is a travellouge, it is a Lazarus story, it is a history, it is a family portrait, it is Cain and Able, it is a revenge story, it is many many things. And most of all, like all great books, it is well worth re-reading. Add this to your library immediately!	2001-04-23

Frankly because he consciously was writing to reflect contemporary (for the 1930's) American Society with an extreme and blatant Leftist leaning, much of his dialouge, characterization and politicising has dated. Yet these selections still contain powerful dramatic representations of life that illuminate a segment of society that literally was ignored by the media of the time.<br />It is arguable, but I think it's true that without Odets' dramatization of the plight of the common man, we wouldn't have witnessed the (admittidly more poetic and timeless) works of Miller, Inge and Williams. Odets, perhaps more than any other playwright of his time, placed &quot;the little guy&quot; in the center of the tragic form. As one reads these plays, one becomes aware that the rules are beginning to break right before the reader's eyes.<br />Odets' plays are, if one is able to check their political hat at the door, fine works of dramtic lit that prove most actable while also allowing a range of staging possibilities. His narratives are clean and direct in the sense that they give the characters a series of clear objectives and actions as well as conflicts to confront. This collection is a most welcome and necessary addition to any theatre library.	2001-04-19

It is at that time, when we are flattened against the wall, that we need a sense of technique, structure and purpose to find a way to continue and allow the idea to reach formation.<br />The Writer's Journey, while not by any means a end all and be all to the writing process, helps strengthen a writer's intellectual sense to perhaps bridge the islands of inspiration.<br />Boiling down the works of Jung, Campbell, Propp and many others (Vogler is most careful in citing his sources and inspirations), Christopher Vogler reminds the screenwriter that his/her story must speak  to the audience and that there are a variety of forms and functions that achieve this purpose.<br />Not only does this book lay out several narrative strategies (all centered around &quot;The hero's journey&quot;), but it also successfully deconstructs several successful films, thereby illustrating mythic structure in practice.<br />It is not a religious tome however, and is not meant to be one. Vogler makes his point very clear, that this book only suggests mythic structure, and that successful stories come out of not simply following a formula, but rather manipulating a form in a new and original manner. All readers of this book must please keep that in mind.The fact that this book has supposedly filled the desks of so many studio exectutives scares me a little- hence the four star rating.<br />The book is helpful as both a reference source and as a beginning point (one should go on to read first hand all the authors mentioned here) for the aspiring playwright/screenwriter. It may alsoserve as a needed bridge between seemingly distant islands.	2001-04-19

The authors wisely build a living frame of reference for Pollock to exist. There is absolutely no way a rule breaker can develop in a vacum and Pollock was no exception. The supporting cast of characters (including America's rich landscapes- so vividly captured here!) stands as a virtual who's who of American Art. Thomas Hart Benton, Peggy Guggenhiem and others recieve detailed sketches as do the WPA and other organizations that helped to shape Pollock's path.<br />Pollock may not have been a &quot;good man&quot; in a moral sense. He comes across as boorish and self-centered, and tragically in many cases, the world's great artists frequently share Pollocks flaws. I seriously doubt that I would have enjoyed spending any time with Pollock the man. Luckily we don't have to, but we do have Pollock's rich legacy of Art in which we can all share.<br />A must read for any lover or student of American Culture, Art or History.	2001-04-18

Brands also doesn't truly succeed, in my view, of creating a broader historical context of the world Teddy lived in and how its effects upon us- always a key point in a successful biography.<br />Those criticisms aside, &quot;The Last Romantic&quot; works as a consitently entertaining and colorful character study. And that may very well have been Brands intention. If so, then he has succeeded marvelously so. <br />Roosevelt was many,many things: scientist, soldier, rancher, philosopher, statesman, traveller and historian (this is just an abbreviated list) besides a president who put the &quot;conserve&quot; in conservative; and Brands may be his biggest fan. Sharing Brands' passion for TR going into this book, I had my admiration confirmed.<br />All in all, this book is highly reccomended not so much as  historical scholarship, but rather as a fascinating portrait of a fascinating man.	2001-04-17

David McCullough's rich biography of one of our most colorful Presidents warrants such an evaluation. I have currently read this fascinating and entertaining history of populist American Politics three times and am eagerly awaiting time for the fourth.<br />McCullough manages to wear many hats as he paints Truman's portrait. He is scholarly, critical, evaluative, praising and holistic while writing this biography as though it is an entertaining and escapist novel.<br />As all successful biographies, McCullough places his subject within the larger historical contex thusly allowing the reader a broader spectrum of reference. America of the first half of the twentieth century grew at a cataclysmic pace and at the center of it was &quot;the walking President&quot;. Explorations of Populist Political Machines, The Two World Wars, Business and Agricultural practices and a detailed depiction of making a President coupled with a very detailed character study of a man who rose in a few short years of public life to the world's highest office make for a great read. <br />Believe the all the other glowing reviews and add this to your library.	2001-04-17

Olson and Roberts include intriguing insights into the Hollywood dream factories, politics and the craft of acting.<br />Wayne comes off here as a suprisingly complex man who not only proved to be a fine actor but an astute business man who willingly allowed himself to be co-opted as a profitable commodity by not only the Hollywood system but by the political arena as well as the American cult of personality. Whether for well or ill,  Wayne came to rdefine not only entire generations of men but also a national identity as well.<br />The book does honestly deal with the fact that Wayne cocooned himself within the sanctity of the manufactured image and took great pains to maintain that carefully constructed product. But what a product it was.<br />Olson and Roberts are reverant to their subject while managing to lend the critical eye a terrible aspect. This book is refreshing in its honesty. Admirable for its respectful treatment. And thoroughly entertaining and enlightening in its detail. Watch Wayne's films and enjoy this book.	2001-04-17

His championing of Hopper, Benton and Pollock as world class visionaries is particularly enlightening (probably because I agree!). Hughes manages to sound scholarly without resorting to dry ivory tower musings. His rants and raves, while maintaining the informed and educated discourse required of a true scholar, also posses the wit and wisdom of skilled stage performer.<br />Although there are plenty of fine reproductions here, even more would have aided in creating a more complete book.

Despite one's political leanings (make no mistake, The Group Theatre were extreme leftest liberals), The Fervent Years provides and endless and bountiful amount of inspiration and stimulation for any theatre artist.<br />Clurman writes in a fine dramatic style that boils with passion, wit and insight.

Mamet, in 127 pages debunks all these false posings and boils theatre art down into simple truths, and causes one invovled in these  noble professions to do a radical sould searching and simplify their lives and approaches.<br />Especially helpful are his chapters on &quot;Talent&quot;, &quot;Ancestor Worship&quot;, &quot;The Rehearsal Process&quot;, &quot;Emotions&quot; (how many times have all actors been crippled by the lie that they aren't connecting emotionally enough to a part!), &quot;I'm on the Corner&quot; and &quot;Action&quot;.

If done improperly, this second chapter can lead to incredibly self conscious acting posing as psuedo-therepy.<br />The chapters of Rythym, Concentration, Dramatic Action, Characterization and Observation however prove helpful, practical and definable. Please begin with this tome.	2001-03-06

In Hole In The Sky, Kittredge mangages to  capture the sad fallacy that underscores  western machismo with often  heartbreaking results. Kittredge pulls off the near impossible in this  modern age of weepy pseudo therepy memoir writing: he reveals inner  failings without sounding tiresome, whiny or trivial. He writes in a prose  style that is devoid of any pretensious posings or trappings. He also  captures a true sense of time and space. As my fellow reviewer has said,  this book is a must read for anyone about to venture into Eastern Oregon  (where I am from) or the rodeo backwater towns of the west. Well worth a  look.	2000-08-07

It is a collection of wonderfully loopy  stories that although they may not focus on developing a specific narrative  thrust, instead hone in on capturing a real sense of time, place and  experience. Each piece is certaintly idiosyncratic and individualistic only  to the unique voice that was the late Brautigan. As a fellow native of the  Pacific Northwest, I find his work as collected here sentimental, haunting  and vividly descriptive and alive. It is also a fine example of  regionalistic literature as his work, while abhereing to the old addage  &quot;only the most personal is the most universal&quot;, simply couldn't  occur in any other region of the world- and that makes it live in all  geographical locations. The other stories collected here, may loose some of  Revenge of the Lawn's focus, they never the less reflect a sadly overlooked  American writer.	2000-08-07
US	51210820	R3VE9SKYLN6ZQU	0385420536	626095980	Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography	Books	5	13	14	N	N	One of the best and most thourough biographies ever written	Written in 1976 when many of Hitler's key contemporaries and friends were still alive, Toland carefully and thouroughly utilizes first person oral  histories and a vast myriad of sources to craft one of the most compelling  biographies ever written.  Toland works effortlessly through his prose to  paint a human face on the individual who left perhaps the greatest imprint  on the 20th Century. Hitler not only perfectly defined and personified Evil  in both the modern and contemporary mind, but also changed the way politics  are conducted. His use of multimedia propaganda lives with us still The  brilliance of Toland's writing is that while he remains completely  objective and true to his subject, he lets history and the facts speak for  themselves.For anyone interested in studying the second world war or the  20th century, I truly reccomend beginning with this book. Five stars out of  five.	2000-08-03

Williams, a close personal friend to Inge who suggested he enter the playwrighting profession, even said that Inge was his favorite. And although his work does lack the dense poetic symbolism of the aforementioned playwrights, Inge grounds his characters in true spare dialouge and often heartbreaking simplicity that deceptively hides complex characters. <br />Proving to be easy stagable and ultimately actable, Inge's dialouge develops out of carefully drawn characters enacting direct and clear objectives. All the plays represented here also feature opportunities(especially &quot;Bus Stop&quot; and &quot;Picnic&quot;)for strong ensemble work. Having both directed and acted in several productions of Inge's scripts, I can say from experience that Inge's language connects easily and brilliantly to the actor. <br />Inge managed to make art that is thouroughly accessible while being most personal. His plays all occur in Kansas and the midwest and yet they are about all of us. Granted this collection would be more complete with his Academy Award Winning script for &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;, but as it stands, this is a great collection from a great playwright who deserves respect as one of America's finest dramatists. Five out of five stars.	2000-07-26

Kazan pulls no punches in depicting his epic journey from Greek immigrant to one of the greatest theatre and film directors of all time.  His life parallels the crucial artistic movements and conflicts of the  Twentieth Century: The Group Theatre, The HUAC hearings, The height and  fall of the Hollywood Studio System, the founding of the Actor's Studio,  and the development of the American Theatre. Kazan, along with Arthur  Miller and Tennessee Williams played a crucial role in creating a strong  and vibrant American Theatre. All throughout this amazing journey are  insights into the craft of acting as well as the trials and tribulations of  a man struggling for personal identity. This book demands to be on the  shelf of any student, practitioner or fan of the Theatre. Five out of five  stars	2000-07-26

I shudder to  use the word text book as that term implies dry academia- an approach which  leads to the the death of the theatre- but really this book is  indespensable to any theatre director. Ball lays out in a logical, simple  and jargon free manner the nuts and bolts of building a balanced right and  left brained community which has complete and utter access to the creative  impulse. Everything in Ball's book is transferable, practical (sorry about  using that term again but it is true)and impeccably rendered. For any  theatre director, I strongly suggest purchasing this book as the foundation  of any library. Five out of five stars.	2000-07-26

This book is highly reccomended for not only the  existing fans (who will already know much of the information present in  this volume) but also to the new Karloff fans as well as anyone interested  in the history of acting and Hollywood. The author also makes a strong case  that Karloff needs to be rightly placed along side the other greats of  Hollywood and Broadway history. A good entertaining and enlightening read.	2000-03-20
