I've read most of the Ryan-Clancy books on vacation, and therefore see all 600 odd pages in a couple of weeks.<br />So to 'Red Rabbit'. Clancy had made Ryan President and the real world of the early 2000's leaves him no room for 'Red October', 'Rainbow Six' or 'The Bear & The Dragon' type blockbusters. So back to the early 1980's - between 'Patriot Games' and 'Red October' on Ryan's timeline.<br />If you are into Jack Ryan you will read it but won't love it. There are many pages that are just repeated 'cut & paste' style a couple of hundred pages later. Deja vu is one thing but it happens too often. Being placed in our history, Ryan is showed to be a genius at predicting the future by investing $100,000 with a coffee startup called Starbucks. The plot - to stop the KGB shooting the Pope has a known end and therefore no surprises.<br />The characters need to be viewed from their position in their evolution. Jack & Cathy are in their early thirties and are <BR>don't read right. It is supposed to be less then a year after 'Patriot Games' and their son is 9 months old but they do not sound like new parents. Cathy doesn't seem like the Mrs Dr Ryan we see in the later books and Jack seems more then a little insipid - occassionally you want to see some backbone and all you have is a wimpy Jack being told by the Brits how courageous he is for saving the Royals last year. Ed and Mary-Pat, newly installed in Moscow, don't seem to be super-spooks of Executive Orders.<br />It is a time period Clancy is more comfortable with - Reagan and Thatcher lead the free world against the Evil Empire of Brezhnev.<br />If you have read the rest of the Ryan story, you will read 'Red Rabbit' regardless of this review. Indeed you have probably already read it. If you are new to the Ryan story, start somewhere else - Patriot Games is probably a good place.	2003-01-24

Asimov is an acknowledged genius. This book is a great example of the man's genius.<br />A general problem with history books is seeing how the little bit you are looking at fits in with the big picture. Asimov doesn't over-analyse - he gives his history in bite sized chunks so the thread of the overall historical flow remains undisrupted.<br />Asimov has the good sense to draw the book to a close while it is still history 50 years before his writing date. The little mention of his birth is just one of the many points that raises a smile.<br />I would have liked more on Australia, but I guess like many parts of the world the stuff Australia did up to the middle of the 20th Century did not have major international impacts.<br />Start reading your history here and then specific areas afterwards.	2002-01-11

He is a good writer but is politically left of most.<br />This book is a rant by a refugee of the 1970's.  His opening definition of Economic Rationalism as &quot;the refusal to spend money on the unneccessary&quot; is sound enough, but the adventure from there on is unsound. It is still interesting to see his logic flow out of rational (pardon the pun) to the bizarre. <br />Ellis argues, by way of example, bringing democracy to Russia led to people dying and therefore Economic Rationalism is evil (Arguement 54).<br />His 202 Arguements Against Economic Rationalism are really the same one repeated: he is an old leftie and doesn't like anything that has happened since 1975.<br />Having said all that, I enjoyed the read. Get it and enjoy it. Anti-Globalisation folk will take it as gospel, the rest of us won't change our worldview because of it.	2002-01-08

Keywords: English, Bloody Funny!!!<br />'Blackadder' was a BBC English  television series staring Rowan Atkinson. It ran for four series (and at  least one special).<br />The four series ran through 450 years of English  History, with the same characters reincarnating /reappearing over that  time.<br />It is bloody funny.<br />Series One has Blackadder as Prince Edmund,  the Black Adder under his father (who hated him) Richard IV set in the late  1400's.<br />Series Two has Lord Edmund Blackadder, a favorite of Elizabeth  I.<br />Series Three has Edmund Blackadder, Butler to the Prince Regent,  Prince George (the son of Mad George III).<br />Series Four has Captain Edmund  Blackadder in the trenches of World War One France in 1917.<br />Always with  his dogsbody Baldrick and always descending the social ladder, Blackadder  is a revisit on history that is well worth a visit.<br />The scripts, the  primary content of this book, are extremely well written. The authors are  Atkinson himself, Ben Elton and Richard Curtis. Other fillers in the book  are original and funny.<br />If you've seen the programs, you will buy the  book anyway. If you don't know Blackadder, get the videos from Amazon.com  and then buy the book. It is excellent.<br />To the Creators of Blackadder,  thank you and isn't it time for another series?	2000-09-05

Peter Walsh was Finance Minister in Australia's Hawke Labor Government in the mid 1980's. He describes himself as a 'failed Finance Minister' because  the economy got worse during his time. <br />The book starts with his birth in  rural Western Australia in 1935, follows his time through the Whitlam  Years, the Fraser Years and the Hawke Years.<br />It is not a comprehensive  history of Australian politics during the 1980's. There are other books  that do that. This volume is a good report on what happened on the  inside.<br />Walsh doesn't change his views after the fact. His recording of  history is consistant with what actually happened. It is a refreshing read  for people who already know a bit about the Australian Political situation  at the time.	2000-08-11

He was arrogant, as  many successful men are. He was self centred, as most of us are.<br />However,  through this book you can see the pain of the failure of his first marriage  and his love for his second wife and daughter. You can see many of the  people he liked. <br />Sure some of it is unfunny, some of it is just plain  crude and some of it is rambling. I liked it and return to it every couple  of years. <br />One reason I did like it was it showed how autobiographical  much of Asimov's other writings were. If you cross check some of the  Foundation series, you can see a reflection in Issac's own life at the time  of writing. This makes this volume a worthy addition for any Issac-ophile.	2000-07-24
