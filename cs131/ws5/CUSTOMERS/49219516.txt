I see some of the parallels with John Eldridge's \\"Wild At Heart\\", where it talks about our domesticated faith.  McManus said that \\"When Christianity becomes just another religion, it focuses on what God requires.\\"  The author writes with a lot of thought and analysis to the current world that we live in, and compares it to the true and actual Biblical perspective of things.  I find it refreshing to read this book because it helped open my eyes to see the Bible as it really is.  Often, we read the Bible with a Cinderella perspective, looking at only the good stuff and somehow just throw away what seems to not fit into our theology of God.  However, McManus looks at the stuff we miss out to show that God is here to free us into a life of adventure with Him -- the Barbarian Way!  As I read this book, I was also reading the life of David in 1 & 2 Samuel, and suddenly, it dawned upon me that if we were to make a movie on the life of David, it would be a R-rated movie.  There was much killings, murder, adultery, and it would definately be R-rated showing David getting 100 foreskins of the Philistines to Saul for the hand of Michal.    There are a lot of great statements that McManus makes, and here are some of them:    \\"God steers us in the direction of His kingdom, His purpose, His passions.  His desire is not to conform us, but to transform us.  Not to make us compliant, but to make us creative.  His intent is never to domesticate us, but to liberate us.\\"    \\"The entire focus of our faith has been the elimiation of sin, which is important but inadequate, rather than the unleashing of a unique, original, extraordinary, wonderfully untamed faith.\\"    \\"To have the Spirit of God dwelling within the heart of someone who chooses a domesticated faith is like having a tiger trapped within a cage.  You are not intended to be a spiritual zoo where people can look at God in you from a safe distance.\\"    \\"People who are fully alivelook out of their minds to those who simply exist.\\"    \\"While barbarians travel together, they do not march in single file.  There is no forced conformity.  They are not required or expected to keep in step.  They walk together as free individuals joined not by standardization, but by spirit.\\"	2005-09-30

It talks about the situation today where we have a disoriented and fearful generation without an identity and what we, the church, must do to disciple this generation.  The authors presents it through LifeShapes, where shapes are used to help us see and understand what and how to apply these principles.    1. Circle - it talks about the process of repentance (observe, reflect and discuss) on the downward slope of the circle, and believe (plan, account, and act) on the upward slope of the circle).    2. Semi-circle - it talks about the pendulum swing between rest and work. Here presents a very interesting and needful concept that we work from our rest.  Man was created on the 6th day, and on the 7th was the rest day, so the first thing that man knew was rest, before work. In this swing, we also vary from pruning vs. growing, and abiding vs. fruitfulness.    3. Triangle - this shows the balanced life where the 3 points of the triangle represent \\"out\\" and \\"in\\" (for the base) and the 3rd point being \\"up\\".  We have to reach in, reach out, and reach up.  In it, it also represents Mal 6:6 to act justly (out), love mercy (in) and walk humbly with God (up).  This model helps us to balance life.    4. Square - this is my favourite section of the book where I personally feel that this portion alone is worth the price of the book.  It shows different discipleship styles and the associate leadership styles that should be employed.  The 4 sides of the square each represent a part of the life and growth of a disciple, ministry or church.    a. D1 - Confident and Incompetant / L1 - Directive    b. D2 - Unenthusiastic and Incompetant / L2 - Visionary/Coach    c. D3 - Growing Confidence / L3 - Pastoral Consensus    d. D4 - The end is in sight / L4 - Delegation  This section also helps you evaluate where you are and show a pathway to where you should head for next.    5. Pentagon - this section talks about the 5 fold ministryof apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor and teacher, and has test at the back of the book to help you see where your ministry gifting lies.  I did that test and found it to be accurate for my life.    6. Hexagon - this section uses the Lord's prayer to show the 6 portion to that prayer, i.e. (i) The Father's Character, (ii) The Father's Kingdom, (iii) The Father's Provision, (iv) The Father's Forgiveness, (v) The Father's Guidance, and (vi) The Father's Protection.    7. Heptagon - this section explains the 7 principles to a vital life and is acronymed MRS GREN (Movement, Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Reproduction, Excretion, and Nutrition).    8. Octagon - the octagon talks about living a mission-minded life representated with 8 P's beginning from a (i) man of peace, (ii) God's presence, (iii) passing relationships, (iv) permanant relationships, (v) proclamation, (vi) preparation, (vii) power, and (viii) perception.	2005-09-18

I am greatly encouraged in reading this because it shows the reality of the journey that God takes us through, the sacrifices that we have to make, the surrender of our lives to God, and how God uses us to forward His purposes and plans.  As Randy mentioned that he is a nobody, and why would God want to use him?  But the very fact that he is a nobody, but is willing to give up what he has to be an instrument in God's hands, that God works through him.  Randy also talks about the difficult times when he divorced his first wife, the difficulty he had to go through with the churches he was at, but also showed the grace of God coming through for him.  It is often not easy to serve God because of what we need to give up in our lives and obey God.  It is also a sacrifice of our free will so that we take God's will upon us, and that was what Randy did as he shared through this book.

This is the 3rd book to be read in the order that C.S. Lewis would like (not the order of which it was written), and it does not have the excitement as previous books.  This is a story of a displaced prince who was prophecied to deliver his people (like a Moses) but was kidnapped and sent to become a slave.  The story happens outside of Narnia, and expands the world that Lewis creates.  The interesting parts of this story was the involvement of Aslan as a driving force to things happening.  In parallel of Aslan to Jesus, it showed how Aslan would appear at the right time and place to drive the purposes of plans of the prophecy forward.  In these events, Aslan even wounded Aravis to reveal to her a lesson.  We can also see how Aslan in his conversations with Shasta and Aravis that he was to tell only their story and not another, and showed how God is concerned about us as individual, even those outside of the promised land of Narnia.  Even though this book lacks some punch, it is still worth reading.	2005-07-11

I have read this book a few times before, but this time, I have come to notice new things that I had never seen before, which truly showed the brilliance of Lewis in weaving the reality of life in a fantasy story.   The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe continues from The Magician's Nephew where the wardrobe that Digory (who became the Professor) made a wardrobe out of the tree he had planted from the core of the Apple (which was used to heal Digory's mother) from Narnia.  Aslan, the Lion, is the parallel of Jesus Christ, and the With parallels Satan.  In this, shows the epic struggle to save the life of Edmund who had become a traitor. <br /> <br />One area that jumped out was the parallels between sin and the Turkish Delight that Edmund ate.  When the witch asked what Edmund wanted, he told her that he wanted Turkish Delight, and that desire for Turkish Delight was already in Edmund, just like the sinful nature of human beings.  The Witch just fed the sinful nature, and it was written of the enchanted Turkish Delight that \\"anyone who had tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go one eating it till they killed themselves.\\"  When we feed our sinful nature, we would keep craving for more, even though we feel the ill effects of it (like Edmund did), and soon become enslaved to it that we could even consume it till it kills us.  This is one of the profound truths that Lewis was communicating through the story. <br /> <br />Also, the way Edmund reacted is so much like that of one who did not know the Savior, like how he had reasoned that the Witch was not so bad and the others may actually be the enemy, but all the time being enslaved to the need to have more Turkish Delight.  The bondage was so strong that the taste of a good and decent meal was not satisfactory, as his mind kept thinking of the Turkish Delight.  Also, when the 4 children were told of Aslan, Peter, Susan and Lucy felt positive things, but Edmund felt \\"a sensationof mysterious horror.\\"  In light of the sin that Edmund had committed, being in the presence of Aslan would send a fear because of the reality of judgment for one's sin. <br /> <br />Another area that was brilliant reveals our mind set towards the spiritual (for this case the world of Narnia) where Peter and Susan did not belive Lucy even though she was the honest one.  The discourse with the Professor was a similar logic that can be applied to Jesus Christ, that if Jesus is telling the truth, then He is God, and if not, He is either a lunatic or a liar.  Historically, He was not called a lunatic or a liar, so Jesus has to be God! <br /> <br />This is a story brilliantly written, and I would likely pick it up some years from now to have a read again and see what gems Lewis had hidden in his writings.	2005-06-28

It contains many parallels and content that every adult would do well taking note of.  This book is even prophetic when Aslan the Lion talks about the world we live in (near the end of the book).  I enjoyed every bit reading this, and the last third of the book just thrilled me that it made my heart beat as I read it. <br /> <br />It is well known that the Chronicles of Narnia parallels the Bible, and in this book, it talks about the creation of Narnia, the entry of evil to Narnia, the temptation of man, and it also helps us understand the origins of the wardrobe in The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.  Though this book was not written first, but it brings context to the next book when read this first. <br /> <br />There are many interesting views that Lewis brings across in this book, like the Wood between the Worlds.  It seem to give the perspective from God's point of view in relation to time and space, where the Wood becomes the view to different worlds, being able to travel from one to another.  Lewis' analogy as a corridor that linked to different apartments in a block of houses was brilliant.  This book also showed the creation of Narnia when they travelled into nothingness, and hearing the singing of the Lion, the world came into being.  This parallels the creation as God spoke it into existence.  This book also showed that Aslan is not just limited to Narnia, but transcend beyond that, and it was interesting when Aslan said to the Cabby, \\"Son, I have known you long, Do you know me?\\"  This implied the existence of Aslan in the world that the Cabby came from. <br /> <br />This book is so full of ideas, thoughts and parallels that Lewis had weaved in it with masterful artistry.  Read and be thrilled!	2005-06-16

This book was written in 1959, and 45 years later, what Ravenhill writes is still applicable today! This book is a prophetic call to the Church to wake up and be the Church of God. I picked up this book as it was highly recommended in another book that impacted me (Growing Deep in God by Edmund Chan), and I have found it deeply ministering.     Ravenhill writes with many one liners that cuts to the chase in the heart of the matter that he is communicating. Phrases like \\"No man is greater than his prayer life. The pastor who is not praying is playing; the people who are not praying are straying\\", \\"Many pray, but few have faith\\", \\"God does not want partnership with us, but ownership of us\\", and \\"Our eyes are dry because our hearts are dry\\" are just some of these phrases that speak mountains of the situation in the Church today.     I do not agree with everything Ravenhill writes about, but I read beyond the words and understand his heart from which he writes this book.  Ravenhill's desire for God comes across strongly, and anything that is apart from God or does not seem to fit into his godly values would seem as \\"sin\\" and hence to be dealt with.  Hence, I recommend this book to your reading (and read beyond the words to catch the fire that burns in Ravenhill's heart), and also Edmund Chan's Growing Deep in God. I find that as I read these 2 books, it is like God doing an open heart surgery on me, revealing the true nature of my heart so that I can repent and have God place a new heart in me (Ezekiel 36:26).	2005-06-08

In the early Pentecostal days with lots of healings and deliverance taking place, what came lacking was the theology to healing and deliverance, and John Wimber wrote Power Healing at a time where a strong renewal theology in healing and deliverance was needed.  This is not a book like those you get from the \\"Word of Faith\\" movements.  This book is solidly grounded on the Word of God, not denying the reality of life, but faces them head on.  This book deals with some very difficult issues, e.g. \\"Can Christians be demon possessed?\\" and \\"Why are all not healed?\\" <br /> <br />I appreciate John's humility in writing this book, not as an expert, but as a practitioner discovering the heart of God in this subject matter.  John wrote candidly and also the struggles he faced, and I believe you would be able to identify very much with what he wrote.  I am most inspired by his perseverence and tenacity in praying for people to be healed.  He began the healing ministry with no one getting healed for 10 months (how many of us would have given up already) but he pressed on believing in God's redemptive heart, of which healing is part of it all.  Through his journey and discovery, he writes this book like a primer to the ministry of healing and deliverance, and this is a must read for anyone venturing into this area.	2005-06-06

It introduces the the life of Robert Langdon, who later appeared in Da Vinci Code, as a person who studies symbols. <br /> <br />In this book, I was very impressed at the speech the camerlengo made about science and religion in chapter 94 of the book.  This perspective of science and religion is somewhat similar to reading Dr. Hugh Ross's books (The Creator & The Cosmos, The Genesis Question) which gave me a different perspective to the whole tension behind science and religion.  Like Brown's book mentioned in chapter 19, \\"Science and religion are not at odds... science is simply too young to understand.\\" <br /> <br />It would be interesting to know how much of what is written in the book is based on fact and research, and how much is fiction.	2005-05-31

I am a dreamer... and I have been on the road to my dream... but as I read this book, I have also come to realize where I am stuck right now.  Wilkinson brings these profound truths with simplicity (but definately not simple as we apply it to our life's situation), and the first section tells of a person by the name of Ordinary going after the Big Dream is a parable that we can relate to.  Depending on where you are in your life, some part of that parable will speak to you, and further explanation would be given at the later sections.  By this, I have come to realize that this book (which is very easy reading) should be read every once in a while as a guide and check on where we are in our dream and where we are stuck in (which we often do every once in a while) so that we can move further and into the next step. <br /> <br />Wilkinson writes this as a Dream Coach, and in coaching, he is helping us discover our dreams and to also realize that the answer to moving forward is very often within us.  He uses questions that others have asked him, quotes it, and then talks about it.  To write a book in a coaching manner is not easy as we have a myriad of different situations, but we have one Dream Giver.  This is also another reason why we should read it every once in a while because as coaching does, it is dynamic and in constant flow and progress.  Seek to please the Dream Giver and you will soon find that every situation in life can be overcome so that we might fulfill the Big Dream that the Dream Given gave us when we were created!	2005-05-31

Rainer did a great research on the unchurched, and in the process, developed a grading on where to place people, i.e. the Rainer Scale of U5 to U1 where U5 are the most resistant and U1 the most receptive.  Rainer goes beyond what people are resistant about to show that, often times, there is history and past experiences that give people a certain perception.  He also offers some approaches towards reaching and building relationships with the different categories of people. <br /> <br />One of the important results of the study is that most people whould go to church if they were invited.  Some young Christians (those who just had a relationship with Jesus) wondered why their Christian colleges, friends and neighbors never opened their mouths to invite them if having a personal relationship with Jesus is a matter of life and death, heaven or hell.  People tend to feel intimidated walking into a church, and so by inviting friends there, and helping them to know their way and meet people, greatly helps.  Also, some Christians have bad experiences with U5s (which constitute only about 5%) and gets turned off from inviting the unchurched or in sharing the gospel.  Christians need to look to the other 95% and get over their bad experiences. <br /> <br />Even as culture and society changes, the results in the future may change from what is presented in this book, but as for now, this research shows that there is a window of opportunity to invite the unchurched to church and leading them to a personal relationship with Jesus.	2005-05-18

By naming the book \\"real\\" faith, Price is implying that there is \\"false\\" faith.  Price showed the difference between belief and faith, that we can believe but have no faith.  Even demons believe in God, but have no faith in Him.  Price states that belief is of the mind, but faith is of the heart. <br /> <br />In this book, Price makes a very important exposition of Scripture in Mark 11:22-24, where our modern translations say \\"Have faith in God\\" but literally it means \\"Have you faith in God?\\" or \\"Have the faith of God.\\"  This would help make sense that having God's faith would be the only faith that could move mountains. <br /> <br />However, I felt that Price was trying to reconcile different experience of faith to a determination of only one kind of faith, and through it, his calvinist perspective comes across.  I believe Price is spot on in many areas, and so the book may be better entitled as \\"The real faith for healing\\" (where there is a new book out in this title) as it would be more relevant than looking at faith for salvation in the same breath as faith for the miraculous. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, for a book published in 1940, it was way ahead of its time.  Many Pentecostal preachers in the early days were not educated, but Price was one of few who were, and could help explain that faith for the miraculous, and help balance the ultra-faith or word of faith preachers.	2005-05-15

I am reading this book the second time as I write this review, not just because it is a book with good points and hard truths, but it is a book that will challenge your perspective on your personal views of the church, and will either leave you thinking what I can do to help the church move forward, or set you to think that that the church is too set in her ways to move forward anymore.  Just let an unchurched person read this book too and see what he thinks about it. <br /> <br />Just as Martin Luther nailed his thesis on the door of the church that started the reformation, this book is liken to Luther's thesis on the modern day institutional church, and the question is what we are going to do about it!  This is a must read if you want to see what the next reformation for the church is to be like, but don't just read it, do something about it.  McNeal warns from the start that if you like the church that you are in the way it is, then maybe this is not the book for you.  What he writes is a hard pill to swallow, but it is one that we must.  Reading it a second time, it feels like I am reading it for the first because it is like a \\"standard\\" to assess where the church is at. <br /> <br />Will you be a \\"next reformation\\" Christian?	2005-05-08

In fact, some portions of the book would be difficult to write about, and even Rainer admits to it, because it shows the ugly side of church, and that most of the problems which prvents a church from being a breakout church happens internally.  Rainer was careful not to make this book appear as a step-by-step approach for churches to break out, and despite the principles that are stated, there is a recognition that great churches are great only because of the power of a great God!  This book also does not imply that great churches are always big churches, but great churches do grow.  Churches are never plateaued, but are always either growing or declining, as the research shows. <br /> <br />\\"Great churches were, in our study, churches that had broken out of the mediocrity of losing as many people as they were reaching.  They were churches that had become outwardly focused, more intentional about evangelism than before.\\" (pg. 189)  Rainer also used the comparison churches who were not categorized as breakout churches constantly to show the difference in principles and perspectives. <br /> <br />Even though the definition of breakout churches may be a bit narrow (e.g. that it has to be the same senior leader that leads the churches to breakout, meaning that if there is a change in the senior leader, it whould not be considered a breakout church), the principles apply the same.  What is important in this research is describing some of the processes that senior leaders of stagnant and declining churches go through, what they realized and learnt from God and their circumstances, having a never-say-die spirit, and to forge ahead a dream that God had put in their hearts for a great church!	2005-04-04

This books helps the reader take a hard look within oneself, and this is necessary to have a healthy relationship with God, self and others.  The book begins with a page called \\"Growing Healthy Fruit\\", which helps the reader identify some of the issues within at a glance.  This page relates the fruit of the spirit with their opposites, i.e. alienation (love), despair (joy), anxiety (peace), intolerance (patience), selfishness (kindness), harshness (gentleness), malice (goodness), reactivity (self-control), and faithlessness (faithfulness). <br /> <br />This is a book to be read reflectively, and when done with that perspective, the reader would get a lot out of it.  It takes a hard look at who we are, and suggests that the wholeness and identity begins with us understanding and living out being children of God (adoption).  As we grew up, we are searching for our identity, and we begin to find them first through our parents.  However, to truly know who we really are, we need to find our identity in our heavenly Father.  <br /> <br />The author also helps us to understand how we receive from others and how we respond to them.  I found the chapter Monkeying Around enlightening because it helps us to look at the motivation by which we do things.  Sometimes, we can be doing something seemingly good, like helping someone out, but the truth of the motivation is that we were doing it no so much for the person we are trying to help, but for ourselves, i.e. to fulfill a deep need.	2005-03-14

This book has been a highlight in my reading this year!  It has challenged me to look deeper into what needs to be done in ministry.  The 7 Practices are (1) Clarify the Win, (2) Think Steps, Not Programs, (3) Narrow the Focus, (4) Teach Less for More, (5) Listen to Outsiders, (6) Replace Yourself, and (7) Work On It.    The book begins with a parable, much like that from authors Spencer Johnson or Ken Blanchard, where the 7 practices are being explained in a story about a pastor with a situation in church where he needs help in.  The story begins with the pastor thinking whether he should go for a board meeting (which he was dreading to go), or to go for possibly the most important baseball game that season.  In order not for me to spoil your reading, I would not go further but to say that the story will wet your appetite for more.    The book continues to explain each practice not only with clarity, but ending each chapter with a list of questions.  It is often that we jump from problem to answers not realizing our answer to the problem may not really be moving us forward.  Hence, to have the right answers, we need to first ask the right questions, and this book provides hard questions for us to evaluate where we are.  The book can be assumed as a coach for any person in ministry, asking the right and tough questions, and the answers that you come up for those questions would be the process to go toward.  This is because every ministry is different, but the questions the same, and your own answers to the questions would suit that context of ministry you are in.	2005-03-13

Because every road to the Promise Land passes through the Wilderness, it is something every person has to go through.  For one, the wilderness has been an area that many people fear to go through, especially after being indoctrinated with a triumphalistic mentality of the Christian life, but Jamie has shown not only the necessity of the wilderness, but also the comfort and security that it brings to the life of the believer.  In a way, it makes me long to stay in the wilderness, but as Jamie pointed, that God's purpose is never to have the wilderness as an end, as some do, but as a pathway to the Promise Land. <br /> <br />Reading this book has shed light on the many areas that God had brought me thorugh, and the lessons learnt, but it also showed and reinforced what had been learnt and to strengthen them in my life.  Jamie, having tracked through the physical wilderness that the Israelites had gone through and to climb Mt. Sinai, brings to life what Moses and the Israelites must have gone through.  His writings cuts deep into the soul to search the hearts and bring the wilderness to the reader.  The wilderness is not a physical place, but it is a process to bring us to the place where we can hear God and walk in His ways. <br /> <br />This is one book that will be read again.  We need to make constant trips back into the wilderness, so that new promise lands can be found as we hear and obey God.  The Epilogue is a climax close to the book as he describes the human response from a group that had tracked through the wilderness with Jamie.  The responses are so human yet so divine, but unless we are constantly aware of our humanity, we would likely return to our wilderness to redicover that part of us. <br />	2004-11-05

This is a really great book that talks about worldviews.  I have not read any book that addresses the issues of our worldviews as comprehensively as this, and it has been incredible understanding how we see things and why.  Charles Kraft weaves his experience of his changing worldview with this writing, and shows the differences between the Western worldview and other worldviews.  It is also interesting to see what peaved him off and what set him back on track to discover the fullness that God wants for each and every Christian, that there is power with Christianity. <br /> <br />Kraft talked about his initial missionary days in Nigeria to the extent that the Nigerians \\"knew\\" that whatever power Christianity brought was inadequate to deal with issues in their lives.  They came to accept Christ as there were many good reasons for being a Christian, but this lack of power gave them a dual allegiance, i.e. a loyalty to Christianity to handle certain needs paralleled by a continuing loyalty to traditional religious practitioners to handle their power needs.  This does not seem that far from much of Christianity today, and Kraft addresses these issues and also challenges us to take that step of faith forward. <br /> <br />It is no wonder that the subtitle to Christianity with Power is \\"Your Worldview and Your Experience of the Supernatural.\\"  How we perceive God is how we relate to Him, and how we understand Him and what He can do is how we would do likewise.  Hence, if we believe that God does not heal or work miracles today (despite believing that Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever), that would become our practice in our Christian life.  So, if you believe that Christianity is not all that you have believed or experienced to date, it's time to read this book and be open to have your worldviews changed. <br />	2004-10-19

John Wimber was the founder and International Director of the Association of Vineyard Churches, and he died peacefully on November 17, 1997 in the presence of his family.  He was sixty-three years old.  His book, Power Evangelism, has now been a widely accepted primer to power evangelism, and the term \\"power evangelism\\" has been used to describe \\"a presentation of the gospel that is rational but that also transcends the rational (though it is in no way 'irrational' or anti-rational).\\"  The book hosts many testimonies that encourages any believer to see that power encounters can be a part of his life too. <br /> <br />Power vs. Non-Power Evangelism? <br />The term \\"power evangelism\\" has some implications to it.  Does it mean that other forms of evangelism do not have power?  Does the power of the Holy Spirit only manifest through signs, wonders, and the gifts of the Spirit?  Romans 1:16 tells us that the gospel of Christ is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes.  The question would then be on how the gospel carries such power, and Wimber writes that the answer lies within what salvation means, i.e. the coming of the kingdom of God.  Power is defined as \\"the ability, the strength, the might to complete a given task\\" and authority is \\"the right to use the power of God\\". <br /> <br />Evangelicals assert that the proclamation of the gospel message has intrinsic spiritual power, which is an assertion that Wimber does not deny.  In fact, any system or force that must be overcome for the gospel to be believed is cause for a power encounter, and unbelief is part of that system or force.  However, Wimber's point is that power evangelism was one of the normal kinds of evangelism in the early Church and has surfaced throughout the history of the Church with remarkable results.  Hence, we should pay more attention to this form of evangelism, especially when it reaps results more efficiently and effectively then other forms of evangelism. <br /> <br />Evangelicals have also historically been concerned with the evangel, i.e. the \\"good news of salvation,\\" but have not looked closely enough on the medium by which the evangel is communicated.  Pentecostals and charismatics have been accused in the past of focusing too much on the gifts of the Spirit, healing, prophecy and intimate worship that evangelism had taken second place and the lives of believers are not grounded theologically.  I believe that what we need to come to an understanding is that evangelism and the good news of salvation has to be preached, but the medium of this preaching is not just mere words, but in the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit through the gifts of the Spirit, signs and wonders.  Wimber brings this point across through numerous testimonies that the most effective way of evangelizing is through the power of the Holy Spirit.  Power evangelism would bring the spiritual-decision process on the Engel Scale from a -10 to a -2 in a matter of minutes, as compared to long discussions, arguments and persuasions.  In fact, in most third-world nations, a careful apology of the gospel does not bring a person to Christ as compared to power evangelism.  Unless they know the reality and power of God, there is no need for them to convert. Hence, such power evangelism necessary, and is the proclamation of the kingdom of God in the fullness of its blessing and promise (which has also been called 'salvation'). <br /> <br />Do you need to be Baptized in the Spirit? <br />I am encouraged that Wimber did not claim that power evangelism is only for those who have been baptized in the Holy Spirit.  I recognize differing theological viewpoints and Wimber's writing is able to hold the tension between Pentecostal and Evangelical views.  The testimonies in this book does not claim that the people who were used of God in power evangelism were baptized in the Holy Spirit, but the opening account of Scott does show that he was baptized in the Spirit, and the closing account of a Methodist pastor showed that he had been empowered with the Holy Spirit. <br /> <br />This would lead to the question as to whether one needs to be baptized in the Holy Spirit to be used of God for power evangelism.  Wimber's own testimony seemed to show that one does not need to be first baptized in the Holy Spirit for power evangelism.  He described his evangelistic efforts from 1963 to 1974 as \\"under 'normal' circumstances... but occasionally I led someone to Christ in an unusual way,\\" having remarkable insights into their lives (word of knowledge).  It was not clear whether he was baptized in the Spirit or not at that time, but I am left to believe that even one who has not been baptized in the Spirit can be used of God for power evangelism.  Even Wimber's definition of power encounter does not specify the baptism in the Holy Spirit as criterion, and likewise we should not. <br /> <br />What does the Bible show us? <br />When looking at the life and ministry of Jesus through the gospels, we find that He spent a large part of His ministry raising the dead, healing the sick and casting out demons.  Wimber asked himself three important questions - (1) How did Jesus evangelize? (2) How did Jesus commission the disciples? (3) How did the disciples respond to the great commission? <br /> <br />The gospel of the kingdom has two aspects to it, (1) proclamation, and (2) demonstration.  We begin to see that there is no dichotomy between evangelism with signs and wonders in the Bible.  Jesus' job description can be found in Isaiah 61:1-2 or Luke 4:18-19, and He did not just preach, but demonstrated the kingdom.  When John asked if Jesus was the Messiah, Jesus' response was not with logical proofs, but by demonstration of power in what that He had done (Matt 11:2-5).  When Jesus commissioned His disciples, it was a commission to do exactly what Jesus had done.  The disciples responded by doing as Jesus did, and the people around knew that they had been with Jesus (Acts 4:13).  We can see this even when Peter raised the dead in Acts 9:36-40 that it was a reflection of Jesus raising the dead in Mark 5:37-42.  It is through this that the \\"greater works\\" (John 14:12) of Jesus may be fulfilled.  I believe that the greater works are not in terms of the quality, but in terms of the quantity.  <br /> <br />Christians Today <br />Why is it that many Christians today still do not move in the power of the Holy Spirit?  Wimber suggests that the \\"proclamation of a faulty gospel will produce faulty or, at best, weak Christian.\\"  He goes on to claim that the faultiness lies in the consumer gospel, where the seeker seeks for his needs to be met, rather then the costly gospel of Christ's death on the cross.  Does this mean that everyone who comes to Jesus with a need would end up a weak Christian?  I believe that for whatever reason a person comes to Jesus, it is a starting point, but the issue is on the church and discipleship, where the emphases on Christianity is focused on being good (behavior) rather than being God's.  Wimber testifies that when you become God's, you will become good. <br /> <br />Christianity has to also go back to being a relationship with God where each person learns to hear from God, and not a list of do's and don'ts.  We have often taught that God speaks through His Word, the Bible, and that is not wrong, but there needs to be an increasing emphasis to hear from God Himself today.  Wimber notes that most Christians miss out on exciting and powerful experiences in their lives either because they are not listening to God, or because of their inattentiveness, God is silent. <br /> <br />Wimber also mentions that Christians are too often searching for methods, formulas and principles that will open the power of God to them.  However, the heart of power evangelism is not a method, formula or principle, but it is to obeyGod when He leads and guides.  Wimber says that divine appointments are an integral part of power evangelism.  \\"Divine appointments are occasions on which God chooses to do his works through our obedience, faith, hope and love.  They are His works, acts to which we add nothing.\\"  His testimony of Kerry, I believe, is similar to what many of us have gone through in the past, i.e. sensing we should speak to a particular person on a word we sense is coming from God but we give all the reasons for not delivering the message.  Hence, power evangelism is the conscious co-operating with the Holy Spirit in our evangelistic efforts, even if it seems absurd or may cause embarrassment. <br /> <br />Wimber came to the conclusion that if an experience such as healing was commonly found in Scripture, but yet not part of his own experience, something had to be wrong with his approach.  I am greatly encouraged by Wimber's testimony of what he went through, and in similar fashion, it encourages us to keep pressing on to see God move through us. <br /> <br />Our Worldviews Affect Our Actions <br />Wimber gives a very important and interesting section on worldviews.  Worldviews are defined as \\"an explanation of how and why things are as they are, and how and why they continue or change... the basis for evaluation, for judging and validating experience... provides psychological reinforcement for a society's way of life... [and] provides integrating and adapting functions for new information, values, philosophies and experiences.\\"  No worldview is perfect, and every worldview has blind spots.  Because the western worldview has an 'excluded middle' of an inability to see how religion and science interact, this same 'excluded middle' includes the influence of angels and demons on everyday life, the Holy Spirit's intervention in divine healing, signs and wonders, and spiritual gifts.  We need to change our worldview to having a Christian worldview with an eternal perspective, an awarenessof power and evil influences, and a Biblical concept of truth.  Because our worldview affects everything we think or do, including our theology, we need to be aware of what our worldviews are, how they affect us, and the need to consciously change them to align ourselves to how God sees things. <br /> <br />I am encouraged by the tenacity of John Wimber, who prayed for 10 months without a single person getting healed, and that is the kind of tenacity that Christians need to press in towards.	2004-09-22
US	49219516	RPI28DX9NAWWW	0875093663	808879634	The Pursuit of God	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Great theology from one who has not been to seminary	Aiden Wilson Tozer was a man who did not have a formal theological education. However, he wrote a book that could well be a complementary reading to a systematic theology textbook, further explaining the things of God where the systematic theology text does not go into.  In fact, Tozer even said that \\"The books on systematic theology overlook this [the things he discusses], but the wise will understand.\\"  His deep insights would definitely come from God himself, and I am humbled by the life of Tozer who takes much time in prayer, study, and seeking the mind of God.  His life as described by James Synder in the forward truly depicted a man in pursuit of God.  Leonard Ravenhill once said of Tozer as \\"Men like him are not college bred but Spirit taught.\\"<br />For a book written in 1949, this man was ahead of his time, and what he wrote about is still relevant and applicable today.  His writing sounds to me like that of a modern day prophet, who could see into the happenings of Christianity, to foretell and forth-tell what would be problems ahead of us, and warn us of the impending dangers if we do not get back onto the straight and narrow (Matt 7:13-14).  As I read this book, I can relate it to Christianity today, the pitfalls and the dangers which Tozer had warned about more than half a century ago.  There are many warnings that Tozer had put forth, and I will attempt to draw some of the lessons of Tozer to what is happening today.<br />Is There Food In The House?<br />Right from the opening of the book, the preface already sounds a rebuke to Bible teachers who do not go beyond the fundamentals to teach in and with the presence of God.  In fact, while reading Tozer's book, it reminded me of Tommy Tenny's book The God Chasers, which is based out of the same verse of Psalm 63:8, and the whole issue of whether there is food in the house of God.  Tozer warns that \\"it is a solemn thing, and no small scandal in the kingdom, to see God's children starving while actually seated at the Father's table.\\"  This rebuke I do not take lightly, but humbly, and it requires me to walk the road Tozer took to put food at the Father's table.<br />Before Tommy Tenny, there was A.W. Tozer, and the warning rings the same 50 years later.  Tozer rightly assessed that today, even though many Christians hold the right opinion of God, true spiritual worship is decreasing, and continually decreasing.  Just as William Seymore prophesied during the Azusa Street Revivals that in the last day, the Great Pentecostal Movement would see an overemphasis on praise to a God they no longer pray to, we see this prevalent in Christianity today and God's people must return to their prayer closets, just like how Tozer did.  As much as we may study from the Bible how the Israelites were stiff-necked people and did not heed the warnings of God, I do not see much difference today.  With many prophecies and warnings, only a handful heed them.  The rest of us are no different from the stiff-necked Israelites.<br />Simplicity of Christianity<BR>Tozer notices that the simplicity which is in Christ is rarely found in us. Today's Christianity has so many fads which have the potential of drawing people away from the personal relationship with God into a faddish relationship with God.  The \\"in thing\\" in the 90's and early 21st century Christianity is the praise and worship movement, where the most adored position in church is to be a worship leader.  Christians go to where the latest and most popular worship band is playing, and tell that they can worship God better there.  Such moves are not in itself bad, but where Christians place their focus on can be detrimental.  If their focus is on the act of worship rather than true spiritual worship of God, it is like a person in love with the feeling of love, not really wanting to truly know the person he is suppose to be in love with.  All this will not satisfy the longing of the heart, as Tozer explains, but the shallowness of our innerexperience, the hollowness of our worship and that servile imitation of the world all testify that we know God only imperfectly.<br />Knowing God<BR>Central to Christianity, and the very basics of it is to know God.  Tozer explains that if we find God amid all the religious externals, we must first determine to find Him, and then proceed in the way of simplicity in a child-like faith.  We are warned that when we seek God, \\"the evil habit of seeking God-and effectively prevents us from finding God in full revelation.\\"  The world is perishing for lack of knowledge of God and the Church is famishing for a lack of His presence.  We must remove every and in seeking Him, and to get back on our knees to pray, enter and live our whole life in His presence.  In fact, Tozer defines \\"believing\\" as \\"directing the heart's attention to Jesus,\\" and \\"faith\\" is the \\"gaze of the heart at God.\\"  This is the sole focus of a Christian, not a God-and, but God and God alone.<br />This knowledge of God is not a head knowledge, but a Biblical perspective of having a relationship with the living God.  Tozer warns us that Christians are in real danger of losing God amid the wonders of His Word.  It would sound paradoxical that a Christian who studies God's Word could end up losing God, just as how modern scientists have lost God amid the wonders of His world.  We need to give up all for all of God.  This personal relationship with God is of utmost importance, and the end is not the act of \\"accepting\\" Christ and praying the sinner's prayer.  Tozer points out an interesting fact that \\"accepting\\" Christ is a term not used in the Bible, but we use it so often today.  In actuality, it is God who accepts us as His children through adoption.  If man \\"accepts\\" Christ, it connotes that man greater than God, but it is contrary, and God being greater accepts us to Him.<br />Tozer follows through to show that theology is always practical.  He rebukes man's idea of reality, and those with lofty intellectual peaks whose ideas are \\"brain-deep\\" but not \\"life-deep.\\"  Tozer insists that Christians are those whose beliefs are practical and are geared into his life, and \\"by them he lives or dies, stands or falls for this world and for all time to come.\\"<br />The Pathway to His Presence<BR>Because of Tozer's relationship with God and his views on Christianity, his writings show deep theology in a practical manner.  He is able to explain profound truths of God in a picturesque manner, and at times through allegories, to help us \\"taste and see\\" God.  Tozer often brings us to points that we have to choose and decide where we want to take our faith and walk with God to. It is either God, or not.  However, not to leave us to decide but not knowing the destination,  Tozer describes the result of taking the pathway to His presence.  It is, however, not an easy road, but warns us of the all we have to give up to get there.<br />Tozer shows the immanence of God through the foundation he laid, i.e. the knowledge of God.  The reason one feels God is near but not another is not that God is far, but that we do not know He is near.  When we want to draw near to God, it is not in a measurable distance, but a nearness of relationship like a father saying of his son, \\"I feel closer to him than 3 years ago.\\"  He goes on to question why some people \\"find\\" God in a way that others do not, and states that the will of God is the same for all, that God has no favorites in His household.  All that God has ever done for any of His children He will do for all of His children, and that the difference does not lie in God but with us.<br />With this claim that Tozer made, I question the complete and total validity.  Is the will of God for every Christian the same?  I beg to differ that each Christian has a unique will, calling, purpose and destiny that only he can fulfill, and no one else.  However, the close relationship that God desires with every of His children is the same.  Because each of us aredifferent, God then relates to us differently.  If we seek what is another's, we may get disappointed that we do not get there, but in actuality, God has something different for us.  Just like in hearing the voice of God, I have learnt that when I read an author writing about how God speaks to him, it is really simply how God speaks to him, but does not totally apply to me.  In the natural, we have also learnt that we relate differently to different people around us.  Hence, each individual needs to discover how God speaks to him in the uniqueness of how God created Him.<br />Conclusion<BR>At the end of the preface, Tozer wrote and humbly claimed that \\"This book is a modest attempt to aid God's hungry children to find Him.  Nothing here is new except in the sense that it is a discovery which my own heart has made of spiritual realities... Others before me have gone much farther into these holy mysteries... but if my fire is not large it is yet real.\\"  Such is the humility that this man had.  Tozer's life showed that the more a person knows God, the more humble he becomes.	2004-01-28
