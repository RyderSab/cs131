What an astounding presentation. An exceptional Christmas present for a teacher, a writer, or a graphics illustrator, a present they will long remember and forever thank you for. Will we watch black and white TV if we have color? So asks Valerie Kirschenbaum, why should a novel or any other book, for that matter be just verbal and not visual?<br /><br />Why cannot a book be beautiful as well as verbally exciting?<br /><br />She goes back to the gorgeous, illustrated books created before Gutenberg took over printing and wonders why we cannot return to that glorious time, when digital printing now makes graphics and various font styles bring alive the pages of our stories. She points out that we read not only to stimulate our imaginations, but our basic emotions: fear, loathing, love, awe, etc. How can we proclaim a revolution in the study of the mind while simultaneously insisting that the findings of those studies must be presented in the same old black and white way? From teaching in the Bronx, her laboratory for what excites lethargic inner city students to wake up and read, she makes us see that there is hope not only for reading, but for teaching, with this new renaissance in publishing. Truly, she has written and designed a masterpiece, for every page is a joy to behold. A watershed book.	2004-11-29

The Bushes are a scary family and they have been feeding at the government trough for nearly 100 years while claiming they are against government welfare. What a bunch of phonies.

This is a terrific story about how NASA falls on its own sword. The characters are well drawn, the women especially. The inside workings of politics is a fun story. How can one writer know so much? One of the best thrillers I have read in several years. Every chapter is a cliff-hanger. When a NASA satellite in the Arctic discovers a meteorite buried deep in a glacier, the foundering Agency grabs the publicity to save it from being voted out of existence by dollar-hungry senators and representatives. The president is also in need of a something to boost his sagging polls. This looks like the life-saver, until it begins to look like a gigantic hoax. And on top of that, someone is willing to kill, and does murder several scientists, in orer to prevent exposure. You won't be able to put this down, once you start it.

None of the characters in this story are memorable. This is the first book I ever threw away. I got to about page 500 and this book ignores all the requirements of the code of the story. The main character is not only not especially likeable, he is no hero and undergoes no arc of character. Don't waste your time or your money.

When Virginia arrives at the murder scene in a posh Bayou City, Texas hotel room, the federal prosecutor's wife has been found with the gun, he and a lover have been found dead in bed together, the motive is obvious, and the wife has been arrested. It looks like a slam-dunk case to Virginia. Enter Leo Zachmann, a shrewd high-profile defense attorney who challenges Virginia to look deeper into the facts -- facts that don't seem to add up to the wife being the murderer.<br />As Virginia and police detective named Smitty delve into the inconsistencies, they come to realize that maybe the wife has been set up, but by then a dismissal of the charges isn't that simple. Powerful people, including a man from Virginia's past, want a quick prosecution and conviction . At the same time, Zachmann and his staff are conducting their own investigation which indicates there's a political conspiracy behind the murders.<br />The story is masterfully told from a point-counterpoint perspective, interweaving the prosecution and defense point of view as Cobb takes the readers through a criminal investigation, into the courtroom, and then on to the unexpected ending. As in L.B. Cobb's debut novel, SPLENDOR BAY, twists, turns, and action keep the pages of PROMISES TOWN turning. It's also filled with deliciously complex relationships, suspense, humor, and some very memorable characters. I'll eager to read more about Virginia and Leo.	2002-11-11

He is neither an editor, nor as near as I can determine, a writer of novels. Most of his information about &quot;detective tales&quot; seems to be based on books written in the 1920s. Do not mistake anything he says as being helpful in the writing of a modern novel. Novels, like clothing, come and go in fashion as to their form and content. You may write what he calls a &quot;tale&quot;, i.e., the relating of adventures that take for granted motives and settings, but if you pursue that course, you will look long and hard for someone to buy it. The modern reader is interested in motivations, and wants your characters to explain themselves to him/her. Actions and dialog without the subtext is boring, and does nothing to illuminate the human condition for the reader.	2001-08-27

It is the clue to putting together a good plot that will appeal to all readers.

Of course, I admit I had to go back and reread the beginning pages, but it was pretty clear that the author had taken giant steps to keep any refernce to him off the page when the murderous events were taking place.  Unfortunately, no one really cares whether Cardoni is innocent or not.  Margolin's main character is a woman, and like most male writers, he lacks the facility to tell the story from the female viewpoint.  Most of the characters are cardboard, and the moment the sex scene came up, I said, she's sleeping with the enemy [and hasn't that one been done to death?].  Save your time and efforts.

It tells you stuff about everyday life in London at the turn of the 18th century that I spent hours and hours learning by reading old books in the Clayton genealogical library in Houston.  If you working in this period, the book is invaluable.  It is concise, yet covers the minutea of everyday life.  Miss Manners of that day is quoted with instructions that if several eat from a large communal bowl, you should not dip your spoon in a second time without wiping it off; and to not fill your mouth with so much food, your cheeks swell like a pair of Scotch bagpipes.  [Yes, they said Scotch, and not Scottish.]  What is fun is that this era opened up much of modern day life and that turn of the century saw the introduction of the &quot;toast,&quot; thick cream [eggnog], punch, coffee and tea.  Coffee houses came into existence, and the varieties of specialty shops that could be accommodated as people began to make enough money to buy commodities they had previously bartered for or made themselves.

If the estate of Margaret Mitchell had not made so much noise about this book, no one would know it existed.  Pick it up and read a few pages.  It is not a parody, it is a joke.  Save your money and get this one from the library if you have to read it.  It's episodic and lacks a narrative with any continuity.  Don't look to fall in love with any of the characters.	2001-06-23

It will not tell you how to write a best selling novel or even tell you what the editors are looking for.  Jeff Herman [if that who is writing; throughout the book there are personal comments, but which of the three authors is making them is anyone's guess] disses fiction which he refers to as &quot;high art&quot; [sort of like &quot;high episcopalian&quot;?]because his agency doesn't sell fiction and never has.  If you write non-fiction, then you will enjoy this book, and it will tell you what you have to do to publicize your book.  There are any number of essays from various writers, many of them famous, but they are mostly &quot;this is how I did it&quot; stories and while some of them are inspirational, none will help you fashion a high-concept novel.  You'll have to go to Albert Zuckerman's book, &quot;Writing the Blockbuster Novel&quot; to learn all about that [and that is one of the best three, the other two being Dwight Swain's &quot;Techniques of the Selling Writer,&quot; and Chris Vogler's &quot;The Writers Journey.&quot;  This book, however, is parading under false pretenses.	2001-06-21

Too bad he can't indict those five thugs in their $25 robes who decided they more than 50 million Americans were entitled to install George W. as president, the most unqualified person ever to hold that office.  Bugliosi scores Scalia and Thomas as disgraces to the judiciary as well as the legal profession and transparent shills for the right wing of the Republican party.  When Renquist administered the oath to George W., he was not only a prop in the majestic ceremony, but a player [Linda Greenhouse, New York Times].  Scratch prop and in its place, write pimp for George W. Don't pass this book by.  Bugliosi very plainly explains how the election was stolen and recites the laws it broke for the five thug-justices to get their way.	2001-05-26

McKee is a terrific analyst and gives you the tools to analyse the scenes of your story.  In an era in which structure and form are as important as the ability to create good characters, McKee provides the key to building your story so that it does what you want it to do.

The suspense in these stories consists of whether or not Marleen will have to take the bad guys in hand and dispose of them.  She's shot a few and creamed a few others.  Her thought processes are marvelous, as are Lucy's, her mother's daughter but with a different slant.  Whether in the courtroom or out, Butch and Marleen will keep you thrilled with inside knowledge of how the justice system works. Tannenbaum is about the only writer that has been able to turn out 11 or 12 books without running out of steam.  His latest is just as good as his first, and there aren't many you can say that about.	2001-03-07

She writes with humor.  She does well inside the heads of her four female characters.  Maybe she knows wherein her talents lie and where they fail.  She had a marvelous tragic hero here, but she only painted him from the view of his childish daughters.  Even more from inside the wife's head would have given us a better aspect of the story she only hints at.  All her male characters are pretty plastic.  Would that we had a really great story about the impact of this misguided missionary on the cultures he seeks to impose his Jesusite politics on.

Dr. Egger puts down numerous myths that have confused and bedeviled the study of serial killers for decades.  A noted authority, a strong academic voice on the subject of criminology.  A fine work.  Includes studies of John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, the Hillside Stranglers and Henry Lee Lucas.  Dr. Egger spent more than 50 hours with Lucas who managed to fool everyone in authority by retracting his early confessions.  The damning factor about Lucas is that teenage girls are no longer disappearing from the highways of South Texas like they did for the past 30 years.	2001-01-16

Another strong pillar of his defense is the finding of an unidentifiable leg in the bomb debris.  A leg that apparently belongs to none of the known victims.  Presumably, the owner walked away on his remaining leg and never showed up at any hospital in the area.  Presumably, the medical examiners trying to patch up numerous body parts got it all right and could not have made a mistake.<br />On top of that, Jones was a party to fake confession of McVeigh's that was designed to confuse far right milita units who might be talked to admitting things they knew about, since Tim had already taken credit for the bombing.  This little subterfuge backfired on the defense when the Dallas Morning Times illegally learned about it and proceeded to tell the world about the confession, not realizing it was fake.<br />But like all murder trials, you can't help but feel the accused is guilty when he won't take the stand in his own defense.  McVeigh taking the stand was never even considered as far as I can determine from this account of the story.  And since McVeigh would rather go to his death, and Nichols to life in prison, rather than incriminate anyone else, one can only conclude they are truly guilty.<br />Nevertheless, I recommend this book to all buffs of courtroom trials and conspiracy buffs who can probably have a lot of fun with it.	2000-10-08
