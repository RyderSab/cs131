You see an author photo of some smug self-satisfied Father Merrin wannabe giving an all knowing look to the camera.  I don't care how many books this shrink has sold in the past, this tome is a cure for insomnia.  Peck may or may not have encountered Satan, but if you read Glimpses of the Devil, you will personally find yourself soon in the arms of Morpheus.  The so called exorcism scenes are dull, and it is rather telling that the video camera does not at all register those \\"Satanic\\" expressions and coiled \\"snake\\" (oil) scenes that Doc Peck rants about. At least Malarkey Malachi Martin writes an interesting factoid about the struggle between an imaginary evil force and an imaginary savior. Satan is older than Jesus, and he throws better parties too, folks.  Is there really a force out there that seeks the destruction of mankind?  Sure, it's name is Man.  Does Doc Peck really get a TKO (testament knock out) of Old Nick in this book? Well, if you believe that, there's some South Dakota ocean front property I just happen to have for sale...	2005-03-06

Not that the &quot;wickedest man in the world&quot; wasn't an occasionally decent writer of prose, or a rather astute observer of humanity--but please--call this guy a great magician, poet, etc?  If someone was a &quot;magus&quot; one might think he wouldn't have lived in near poverty, could have arranged a more successful life for himself, and wouldn't have to publish so much of his own literary works at his own expense.  When will the wannabe wizards wake up? If you are good at &quot;causing change in conformity with will&quot; your life works pretty well.  You don't get chased from one country to the next, get hooked on heroin (yeah, OK he had asthma, big deal)or go through periods of near starvation.<BR>Suster doesn't really add much to the already &quot;done to death&quot; life of Crowley. He does &quot;correct&quot; certain supposed errors about <BR>AC, but he fails to recognize that Crowley was an articulate poseur all of his life, and despite some unprovable anecdotes, was no great shakes as a practical magician. (Although there are parts in Book Four and Magick In Theory and Practice that are highly intelligent and instructive). The Occult world is overloaded with grand poobahs who couldn't evoke a sneeze in a feather factory.  It's about time Crowley was properly viewed as a con man from the great Beyond. Matter of fact, Colin Wilson did just that in &quot;The Nature of the Beast.&quot;	2004-05-21

Also, the &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; was done better by Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel.  Nothing really original here, but it never hurts to take strange drugs and drink wines that foam, and all of the other stuff Crowley did without having to become logos of the aeon.  Crowley was a massive failure in three dimensions, so he cooked up some &quot;credentials&quot; for the credulous in the fourth dimension with the Book of the Law.  Strange that this Sumerian demon just happens to speak English, with some Latin thrown in, and does it in the purple prose of the demon poet Crowley.<BR>Every man and woman is a star?

You do have an interesting style of writing, though.  Kessler often refers to individuals he interviewed &quot;before their death&quot; in some such year. One might understand that in all probability an interview with someone would occur prior to their death, unless this was a book by Hans Holzer. (Or Shirley Mclaine).On occasion Kessler throws in some irrelevant contemporaneous happenings that have nothing to do with intelligence matters. Why?  And Oh how we love George Bush and George Tenet.  No wonder Tenet gave this spin doctor access and interviews--Kessler writes like he's  bloody George's press agent. And you get some nice pictures of George Bush looking like he has some idea of what's going on. (Must be some kind of trick photography). It's 2004, and Bush Lied, and everybody knows it. Tenet's a nice guy, I met him in 2000 when I gave him a copy of my little intelligence related book (by the same publisher as Kessler's).  Is he what we need at the helm of the CIA? Insufficient data. Is he this halo and wing character that Kessler portrays? Kinda doubt it.

Seven kids (typical King cartoon characters) confront a force of evil being fronted by Pennywise the Dancing Clown in small town &quot;Derry&quot; in 1958.  They win the first round, but are back in 1985 for the final showdown between IT, and six of the seven kids all grown up. (One of the seven shaved his veins a little too closely). Unfortunately, King puts on the heavy padding, and no editor with an eye towards job security, would dare cut the master earner of all times.  But this ton of tome should have been shorn by half.

The rest of the book, while nourishing for would be [and actual] Thelemites, is certainly not to be taken as anything except the Gospel According to Aleister Crowley.
