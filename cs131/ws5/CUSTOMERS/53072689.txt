The new Penguin Jazz Guide is an indispensable as its predecessors, but it is not without its faults. I have owned every edition since 1992 - the latest is the 7th. The fact that I keep buying it indicates my appreciation of this thorough work.  <br /> <br />Personally I find many reviews witty, but professional. The Guide's faults are few, but they seem to persist over subsequent editions.  <br />* Coverage is spotty. As a Dutch-speaking South African-Australian living in Canada, I really do want to see coverage of jazz world-wide. In the past I have complained about the scant coverage of the Southern Hemisphere (Australia and South Africa). But even coverage of European jazz is incomplete. Recently I saw the Dutch band \\"Bik Bent Braam\\" and the Belgian band \\"Octurn\\" on tour through the Canadian summer jazz festivals. Both bands have several CDs in print and available through various Amazon branches. However, neither band made it into the Guide. What is the reason for this censorship?  <br />* Other European artist listings are out of date. For example, (Swedish) Lars Gullen's 2002 CD \\"First Walk\\" did not make it to this 2005 edition book yet, but older recordings are there. For British (South African) artists such as the Blue Notes and Brotherhood of Breath, discontinued recordings are still shown, but the several recent releases are missing. The Dedication Orchestra and Chris McGreggor have totally disappeared from previous volumes. An inconsistency? An oversight?  <br />* I guess the book is growing, and so the publishers seem to be limiting space more and more. With the 7th edition, the index has disappeared! We ask for a CD-Rom to cross-reference musicians, and they respond by cutting the only index we have! Ouch!  <br />* LPs were covered in the 1st edition, but are no longer covered. Titles deleted by CD publishers are excluded from new editions. Deleted titles should at least be listed with a rating, even if the review is cut, imho. Better yet. Please give us a \\"Volume 2\\" covering all the deleted albums from the previous editions, and with lesser known artists on fringe labels! You can add the requested cross-referencing CD-Rom to this Volume 2. And the old index.  <br />* European catalogue numbers have been provided, but not the US equivalents. [...] Often there are equivalent editions of CDs available in various countries. Or CDs with very similar titles on different labels.  <br />* The amount of typos is probably acceptable for a book of this size, but it is unfortunate that the same errors keep appearing in subsequent editions. A good overall edit is still required for the next edition (eg. listing the wrong tracks with the wrong album title). Many album reviews have not been updated since the 1st edition.  <br /> <br />With the 7th edition, the authors have introduced a \\"Core Collection\\" list. I suggest that it will be impossible for anyone to collect this entire list. It is too difficult, too expensive - and too late in the game. A quick count came up with more than 250 CDs (counting sets). Unfortunately every time the Guide is published, many CDs have already been deleted by the record companies - of course not the authors' fault. If you want to collect the core list, I suggest you stick with your favourite artists.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, I have collected all the crown (= five stars) albums since the first edition, and my collection is now complete. It is much easier to spread a collection out over time, as there are only a handful of new editions to the crown CD list with every new edition of the Guide. Often still hard to find. For example, \\"New Orleans Rhythm Kings 1922-1925 The complete set\\" from the 7th edition is near impossible to find right now.  <br /> <br />In summary, my knowledge of Jazz has definitely increased a lot (across all styles) over the last 12 years, and my Jazz CD collection has improved from mediocre to excellent. But for all the above reasons I am still giving the Guide only4 stars. Let us now hope for a refreshed 8th edition. I know the authors will have fun compiling it. I am certainly looking forward to reading BOTH volumes of it :-).	2005-09-20
US	53072689	RH8CEAU0VCWNW	0967152305	223297993	The Hand Exposure Meter Book	Books	1	5	6	N	Y	If you've read it once, you would have read it several times	I bought this book in spite of the other reviews, because I have a new Sekonic light meter that I need to learn more about. I could not identify another book for that purpose. So I blame myself.<br />You can certainly find a few gems of wisdom in this book, and benefit from the authors' experience. Four well-known photographers, each one of them obviously very experienced with light meters, co-authored it. And they know about light meters.<br />However, I must agree with the other reviewers that this book has been slapped together without proper editing. The book appears to be a set of magazine articles put together between glossy covers without much thought. Not only is there repetition between the different authors, but also each author repeats the same information under different headings. But what I really find unforgivable is the fact that the same author will repeat the same information ad nauseam under the same heading - even on the same page! It is almost like several articles, written at different times, were combined under each heading, without any editing. Jim Zuckerman, who wrote the bulk of the book, is most guilty of this. But where was Bob Shell, the editor? Out on a shoot? And there is no organized attempt to summarise the information in a useable form. And get this - this is the second edition!<br />The book has about 80 pages. It could have been written in 20 and sold for 5 bucks. Or better yet, it should have been given away for free as a (20-page) \\"how to\\" manual with every new Sekonic exposure meter, seeing that it was published by Mamiya (the distributor of Sekonic), and features the Sekonic brand on the front cover and through-out. Heck, I even got a Sekonic catalog inside my copy from Amazon. This book is an bad attempt by Mamiya/Sekonic to increase company profits.	2004-04-05

And before the current edition (1994), I owned the older edition. <br />My interest is mainly 20th century serious music, and jazz. Unlike the \\"Oxford Companion to Music\\", the Dictionary covers 20th century relatively well. Many obscure composers are listed who are not listed in other books, for example Lebrecht's \\"Complete Companion to 20th Century Music\\". As such the Dictionary indispensable for me. The information is more factual (and less opinionated) than Lebrecht's. I particularly like the alphabetic arrangement which allows me to quickly look up someone whose music I have discovered by change, or whose name was mentioned in an article or whatever. The listing of works by each composer is reasonably complete, particularly for well-know composers.<br />Of course the Dictionary covers more than composers or even 20th century composers. It covers artists (performers and conductors), major works, musical terms and forms, organisations, instruments, venues, etc. And entries are cross-referenced, as one would expect. The Dictionary contains very few illustrations.<br />There are 12,500 entries in the second edition, so one would not expect a huge depth. You will often need to know more. However, the Dictionary is a comprehensive, detailed, reliable reference work on music, and as such a good starting point for most topics.	2002-07-19
US	53072689	R1NKDPPNCETW8Z	1572594225	898494843	Listen-- Brief Fourth Edition	Books	4	61	61	N	N	A good introductory text	I have had this book prescribed as a textbook for a music history and theory course. This is a good book for such a purpose, it covers much. (This review is on the third edition).<br />Unit I has 5 chapters covering the fundamentals of musical theory. Sound, time, pitch, structure, form and style. Unit II is a 4-chapter overview of early music, starting with the Middle Ages. Unit III covers the 18th century in 6 chapters, starting with Late Baroque. Unit IV focuses on the 19th century, starting with Beethoven and finishing with the Late Romantics in 5 chapters.<br />Unit V: The Twentieth Century, was my favourite section. The prelude chapter discusses the concepts of music and modernism. The next chapter covers the early 20th century, then there is a chapter on alternatives to modernism,  and the fourth chapter covers the late 20the century. Chapter 24 focuses on music in America: Jazz.<br />The book is organised around listening samples. These are available on a set of a 6 accompanying CDs. I liked the samples chosen. The late 20th century chapter, for example, discussed works by Ligeti, Berio, Varese, Cage, Crumb, Leon, Gubaidulina and Reich.<br />An alternative to \\"Listen\\" is Music: An appreciation\\" by Roger Kamien. It seems to me to have a bit more on artistic context, whilst at the same time covering more topics at slightly more depth.<br />However, \\"Listen\\" is well organised (always a good sign), and richly illustrated. Historical events are touched upon, and there is some reference to other art forms in context with the music of the time. I would recommend it as an introductory text even if you don't need to read it for school. Of course a book like this can cover topics only to a limited depth.	2002-07-19

Having reached what feels like a rut in my career - with the accompanying lack of motivation - I noticed this book on a sale-stand and decided to give it a go. The back-cover promises to give your career a tune-up and keep it in prime running condition. I need that.<br />There are two ways of reading this book. It is organised as a workbook, so the intentions of the authors were probably for readers to diligently work through the exercises. The second option is to skim through the book, and come back to some of the exercises as needed. I decided to take the second approach.<br />Sub-titled \\"10 new habits for keeping your edge in today's fast-paced workplace\\", the book certainly covers relevant topics. Issues covered include focussing on the job, prioritisation, communication skills, networking, problem solving, innovation, and adapting to change. It then prompts the reader to fix their own problems, and to take responsibility for their own performance, and to stay current with their skills.<br />Reading the book cover to cover is probably not the best approach - no one can have problems with all of the above. I focussed more on a couple of chapters, which I found more relevant. In other chapters I felt that I was being told things I already knew, so I skimmed. But I can see how working through the exercises can help you mentally prepare for the real thing. It should give you a few extra tools in your toolkit.<br />Will this book change my working habits? I don't know that for sure. But I'll keep it on my shelf for ideas for when I get stuck in a particular area. It may just help me over a hump or two.	2002-07-19
US	53072689	RYORE7I5I4XIF	0385267320	882669832	The Art of the Long View: Planning for the Future in an Uncertain World	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	Take your instinct to a higher level!	I belief that I possess a strong and reliable gut-feel or instinct. I also have a good knack for organising and quantifying information to help me in the process of decision making. Together these factors which have helped me through many decisions, from moderately difficult to life changing decisions, such as immigration.<br />But Peter Schwartz's book takes planning for the future to a much higher level. Subtitled \\"Planning for the future in an uncertain world\\", in \\"The art of the long view\\" Schwartz illustrates his own successful recipe for practical futurism. <br />He outlines a \\"scenario\\" approach for developing a strategic vision. This approach involves developing 2 - 4 varying scenarios. The approach is based upon a series of steps for developing each scenario, preparing for the likelihood each scenario, and recognising early on which one (or more than one) scenario is actually eventuating, so that appropriate steps can be taken.<br />Although the proposed scenarios are to be presented in a narrative form (which may make some people uncomfortable), the \\"Long View\\" approach is quite methodical (though it could perhaps have been presented in a more organised fashion). Apart from that, the approach holds much advantage. I expected a full-on business book glorifying globalisation, knowing that Schwartz had been involved with several multi-nationals like the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company. I was therefore pleasantly surprised with Schwartz's environmental leanings and his inclusion of the ecological impacts of decisions in scenarios.<br />Taking into account the success rate of teams in which Schwartz has been involved with in the past, the scenario developing strategy definitely seems to me to have much merit. (It would be interesting to see how his predictions for 2005 turns out - in 3 years time). Now if we could only get politicians to read this book and look past their re-election windows. Highly recommended.	2002-07-19

It is a tale clothed in the myth of Adamastor, which first appeared in European literature in the 16th century. It is a tale about the main character T'Kamais (bigbird \\"that never came to rest\\"), and his relationship with s lost Portuguese woman.<br />What makes this tale different from many other accounts is that the tale is told from the viewpoint of the African Khoikhoin, and not the Portuguese. This makes an interesting contrast to \\"Verkenning\\" of Karel Schoeman (see my review). Verkenning describes (in historical detail) the exploration of Southern Africa from a Dutch explorer's point of view (set a couple of centuries after Adamastor).<br />This book is written with Brink's subtle sense of humour never far from the surface. However, the story has a very sad undertone - the misunderstanding between different peoples with different cultures and their different belief systems and mythologies.<br />Easy to read and enjoyable, Adamastor is highly recommended.	2002-07-19
US	53072689	R1JTLHY85RDLNM	0306807343	106841017	The Companion To 20th-century Music	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	One of the better reference books on 20th century music	Okay. I should qualify that. This book is not intended to cover popular music. Not even jazz.  We are only talking about \\"art\\" or \\"serious\\" music here. And then only some of that. But since you are here, you probably know that already. ...<br />Mr. Lebrecht is a fairly opinionated Englishman. If you agree with him, fine. If you don't, tough. (Example, from the entry on Australasia: \\"A late developer in musical terms, the antipodes contributed sopranos - ... - and little else\\". Ouch! Mr. Lebrecht doesn't care much for electronic/computer music. Ouch again.)<br />I guess I am lucky in that I agree with many Mr. Lebrecht's opinions - most of the time. So I actually find the \\"Companion\\" a handy reference to some of my favourite music. I haven't found a similar book that covers as much as what this one does. And I often appreciate the critical viewpoints.<br />Negative points:<BR>The \\"Companion\\" tries to cover a lot. This means that every heading provides only a limited amount of information. Yet most topics packs a punch. Other books cover fewer topics, but more information per topic. <BR>At the same time the \\"Companion\\" does not cover everything. I found that many obscure artists (including composers) are missing from the book.<BR>And there is little overall historical analysis of the entire period. The book is presented in the dictionary style - which is what I wanted. Yet it is still nice to browse through. Entries are cross-referenced, as one would expect.<br />After 429 pages, the appendix has a historical timeline covering world events, the arts, and music. I would have liked a visual diagram of how, say, American composers relate to each other. There are 13 photos, and a handful of line drawings.<br />For other periods of classical music, you'll need the Oxford Dictionary of Music edited by Michael Kennedy. If you are interested in jazz (as well), look elsewhere. I recommend The New Grove's Dictionary of Jazz edited by Barry Kernfeld.  As for the \\"Companion\\", getthe second edition. It covers the whole of the last century.	2002-05-29
US	53072689	RRYQTQ5GJNK1W	0451628802	821667189	What to Listen for in Music	Books	4	4	4	N	N	This one will stay on your shelf for some years.	I actually bought and read this book 10 years ago now. I recently went back to it, after my partner's newly found interest in classical music.<br />\\"What to listen for in music\\" is a classic book, written by someone who REALLY understood the subject. The first edition appeared in 1939, and a major revision appeared in 1957. So the musical examples are a bit out of date. Yet the book is as relevant as ever. If you are new to music, or new to classical music, this is a great place to start. Even if you have some musical background (like I have) the book can teach you a lot. <br />The book covers many areas, and very important from the listener's point of view, is the design of the musical piece. What are the elements of music (rhythm, melody, harmony and tone), and how does the composer use these elements to create a composition.<br />Next, musical texture (monophony, homophony and polyphony) and structure (or organisation) are covered. Much of the rest of the book (nearly half) is devoted to musical forms. Too much to summarise here, yet the material is presented clearly enough for the average listener to understand - the book is not intended as a university text, but as a guide for music appreciation. <br />There is also a chapter about contemporary music, and a few appendixes with examples and analysis. For me, one of the big benefits of the book is that it introduced me to a lot of new music (including American music) that I did not know before. The list of recorded musical examples is nearly 7 pages long, and most of this music is still available in recorded format today. It has taken me 10 years, but I have listened to most of these examples by now, and in the process my musical knowledge and experience have been expanded significantly. <br />This book makes a nice companion to Barry Kernfeld's \\"What to listen for in jazz\\". One small complaint. My cheap edition (Mentor) is of fairly low quality. After 10 years, it is falling apart. If you want to keep this bookon your shelf for along time (and you would want to), then buy a quality edition.	2002-05-29

As a long standing Sybase Adaptive Server and Tools specialist and trainer, I bought this book hoping to extend my skills to Microsoft SQL Server. I also intended to use this book as a reference. The two products have the same roots after all, and both use a flavour of Transact-SQL.<br />The Guru's Guide is basically structured around SQL syntax. It starts with introductory chapters on Transact-SQL, both DDL and DML. Chapters 6 onwards cover SQL in more detail. Many examples accompany the text. And the further you get into the book, the beefier it gets. Advance topics like cursors and transactions are covered well. <br />Stored Procedures and Triggers are only glanced over in this book - these topics are left for the more advanced Guru's Guide to Stored Procedures. But some administrative issues are covered, and covered well. System procedures are discussed, and you can find code for the useful ones that are NOT supplied by the vendors. Talking about which, another topic of interest is the undocumented features T-SQL. The things that are there, but the vendors did not want you to know about it.<br />Database design and performance tuning are topics sorely needed by many application programmers, in my experience, and I recommend these chapters to anyone who needs grounding in these areas. Other programming issues like full-text searching is covered, and there is a neat replacement procedure for Soundex to be found. Many bits and pieces make a good reading of the book worthwhile.<br />All the code are included on a CD-ROM. If you are a Sybase user, do not expect the bonus SQL editor (on the CD-ROM) to work for you. You'll get a message saying &quot;this demo version can only connect to MS SQL Server&quot;. Should you visit the website to look for the non-demo version, you'll find a version tied even closer to Microsoft. It won't even install without MS SQL Server present. I thought that this was unfortunate.<br />This book covers so much that I find it hard to summarise it in a few paragraphs. It is obviously recommended for MS SQL server professionals - there are enough glowing reviews on this page. Do I recommend it for Sybase users? Well yes, maybe. If you accept that MS SQL Server and Sybase Adaptive Server have grown apart over the years and that there are many incompatibilities between the two. So while you can use the Guru's guide for ideas, hints and tips and techniques, it will not serve as an exact reference manual. But I think you'll find much of value. This is one of the better database and  SQL books I have seen.<br />I have also purchased the follow up Guru SQL book, which is more advanced than the present book. What would also be nice is a book on SQL algorithms or patterns. Maybe Ken Henderson can do a follow-up that provides sample solutions to common SQL problems. And how about a book that covers the differences between to MS SQL Server and Sybase Adaptive Server?	2002-05-29
US	53072689	R23GTCENLYIHWO	0201699699	615308119	Agile Software Development	Books	4	34	37	N	N	This book has changed my mind - to some extend...	When I started reading this book I was not a fan of XP, but certainly in favour of lighter methodologies. The book is unusual (amongst IT books) in the sense that it starts off with patterns of human communication. In fact the first three chapters - which analyses game-play, individual communication modes, and team cooperation - covers about 40% of the book. However, it was this section of the book that won me over and convinced me about the basis of the \\"methodologies\\" such as XP.<br />But for me personally the most practical and relevant chapter was Chapter 5: \\"Agile and self-adapting\\". In this chapter Cockburn covers issues such as how much documentation, team structures, and most importantly: a methodology growing technique. This chapter is closely followed in importance by chapter 4: \\"Methodologies\\". In this chapter Cockburn covers methodology concepts and design principles, including how to publish and introduce (role out) a methodology (before going on to dissect XP). Chapter 6: \\"The crystal methodologies\\" consolidates these ideas. Cockburn takes you along while describing and shaping his family of Crystal methodologies.<br />The book is rounded of with the agile software development manifesto, a formal proposal drawn up by several software authors; and philosophical contributions from other authors. Many good references can be found in the appendix.<br />Cockburn acknowledges that the chosen methodology must fit issues such as the project and team size and environment. And although I can see the benefits of many aspects of the agile philosophy, there are other aspects I am still cynical about. However, my review is not about XP, but about this book. And the book is well written, well argued, sensible, with plenty of stories and examples, which makes it easy to read. In my case, Cockburn was NOT preaching to the converted, and I gained much value from reading the book. It helped me to question some of my preconceived ideas and long-held views.	2002-05-07

It is particularly useful for looking up the biographies of artists that you're interested in. Less useful are the lists of jazz club venues - likely to be quite out of date by now.<br />What I liked especially about the dictionary, is its comprehensiveness. Artists from all continents are covered - although musicians from far-flung places (as in not-in-the-USA)are more likely to be missing. On the negative side, you'll find that the book is now out of date when it comes to contemporary musicians.<br />I have for example compiled a list of all artists born in African, Australia and New Zealand from the book. While a number of well-known musicians are missing, the youngest person on my list was born in 1947 - 55 years ago - not good for a book that was reviewed in 1994.  One would suspect that the contemporary jazz renaissance of the 1990s is totally absent.<br />So in summary, this is a well-written, well edited, good reference source, but badly in need of an update. I would also enjoy more personal details about artists in the next edition.	2002-04-01

Whilst the information is not in depth, it is at the right level to explain the concepts clearly, and it gives practical examples. You won't find pages and pages of Java code. But you'll find a case study built up during the first 15 chapters, and nicely summarised in the final chapter.<br />After a few introductory chapters, 5 chapters are devoted to explaining UML. Already familiar with UML, I skimmed through this, but still picked up good information. Particularly useful background was chapter 6, \\"Architecture\\".<br />The more technical chapters, 9 to 15, explain the J2EE technology in the contect of UML. I found this well explained with just enough information, with no pages \\"wasted\\" on code listings. But some Java is present, showing how UML would map to code. The different components of J2EE each has a chapter devoted to them, and the relationships between them are discussed.<br />All of the above is discussed in the context of RUP (Rational Unified Process), and the case study follows that process as well. The references to Conallen's WAE and the SUN standards are also very useful.<br />The authors should be congratulated on writing a very clear, well-edited well-organised book.	2002-02-15

This is at the end of the Dutch period of the South African history.<br />The travel diaries are loosely wound around contemporary Dutch text from various sources. On a personal level, the story explore the experiences of a newcomer from Holland in Africa. Colonialists who have been in Africa for generations, are seen through his eyes - along with the native tribes, slaves and countryside, and animals. The personal manners of the colonists are sketched, their language skills, lack of refinement, roughness and toughness.<br />I found the book fascinating if a bit slow-going at times. I was particularly interested in the lifestyles of people - my ancestors - at that time. Through the eyes of the author, I had a window on life in early Dutch colonial times in Africa. For me an interesting travel experience also. A (hi)story in the fine tradition of Karel Schoeman.	2002-02-02

The book explores 5 principles behind Software Architecture; namely Vision, Rhythm, Anticipation, Partnering, and Simplification; or VRAPS for short. Not only will you learn these principles, but you'll get an introduction to patterns and antipatterns as well. Yet it is not a &quot;How To&quot; on Software Architecture.<br />Much of the book is devoted to VRAPS. After a few introductory chapters, each principle is defined, explained, and then illuminated with criteria, antipatterns and patterns.<br />Chapter 8 introduces a case study, based upon a well known Internet company. Allaire's jouney through each principle is discussed, including successful practices and warning signs.<br />Chapter 9 is added for completeness. It presents a case study about building and implementing a benchmark framework for VRAPS. The authors surveyed many organisations in compiling this book, and their results are published here in a summary form.<br />The book is rounded off with useful Appendixes. One provides a quick reference principles, criteria, antipatterns and patterns, the other is an index of patterns and antipatterns cross-referenced to principles. Overall I found the book to be well structured and well organised - and not too hard too read.<br />This is the third book I've read from the Software Architecture Series, and the most practical and useful so far. This book should go far in establishing a basic process for Software Architecture that is both theoretical and practical.	2002-02-02

This is probably the one I'll buy with my next PC.<br />Yet Mueller's book is still useful after all these years for the older PCs in my stable. The information about setting hard-drives up in the Bios alone is worth the money I paid for the book - though I found some inconsistencies here.<br />The book will also help you understand how components of your PC works, yet it is not a reference on how to fix the operating system. Hardware troubleshooting is fairly well covered though. I did not find the cd-roms particularly useful.	2002-02-02

The Sewell's try to address the crisis in our industry by attempting to formalise and define the role and profession of the software architecture. They do this by comparing the software industry to the building industry. They advocate specific educational programs for software architects. Personally I feel that this approach is valid  - I have post-graduate qualifications from a school of (building) architecture and design, plus bachelors in computer science - but work as a software architect. Yet I find a lot of confusion in the marketplace (and sometimes in my own mind) about what a software architect is and is not.<br />This is not a practical book. Instead it attempts to provide a philosophical basis and justification for the profession of software architecture. If you read this book hoping to find an architectural process or methodology, look somewhere else. If you are looking for a set of templates to use as a basis for your practice, read Dikel eta al's \\"Software Architecture\\" instead. But perhaps the current book will contribute significantly the debate that is sorely needed in the software industry.<br />The book is well-written and a pleasure to read. I found the anecdotes relevant and enlightening.	2002-01-10

(Da Capo Paperback)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Worthwhile introduction to African popular music	Slightly outdated now, this book is nevertheless a good introduction to the musics of Africa. Unlike the academic or ethnomusicological approaches to the subject by many other titles, &quot;Africa O-Ye&quot; has a more popular approach. <br />The book is well laid out and well organised - with plenty colour and black and white photographs and illustrations. Yet it is more than  a biography or &quot;dictionary&quot; of musicians. It covers the history and context of music in Africa, and then it covers the entire continent, region by region. Within every region, all major popular musical forms are covered, and in these sub-sections, the musicians practising that style are covered. Finally, the book is rounded off with a discography, again organised by region, followed by a bibliography and an index.	2001-12-07

I also own the &quot;New grove Dictionary of Jazz&quot;, which he edited. &quot;What to listen for in jazz&quot; is well-written, though it can be hard going if you're not familiar with all the musical jargon.<br />The book is accompanied by a CD containing a rich selection of songs, covering many decades and many styles. Unfortuantely, some songs are excerpts (for example John Coltrane's Ascension). Excerpts of the notation of the songs are printed in the book. For example, I found enough about Weather Report's Birdland to understand the structure of the song well enough for my purposes.<br />I also found the book to be well organised. The chapters cover rhythm, forms, arrangement, composition, improvisation, sound and style. The appendices feature a discography and biographical sketches of some musicians, and there is also a good index.<br />If you read this book along with Aaron Copland's &quot;What to listen for in music, you will not only learn heaps more about music, but you will enjoy your music heaps more.	2001-12-07

This is mostly string music (kora, nyanyer, electric kora) supplemented by the balafon and drums of the area. <br />The music originates in West Africa - in the countries of Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Mali, and showcases the Griots (or Jalis) of West Africa. Because it is the place where many of America's slaves come from, West African culture has strongly impacted life in the USA. <br />For 800 years - since the beginning of the great Malian empire - Griots have preserved their region's history and lore, passing them down orally through arduous apprenticeships, providing cultural cohesion that endured both colonialisation and its aftermath. <br />The names of the musicians on the album read like a who's who of the musicians caste of West Africa: Kuyateh, Suso, Jobarteh, and others. Featured on the album is Foday Musa Suso, who is well known in the West. To this, add some of the best Western names in the business, like 20th Century minimalist composer Philip Glass, Jazz saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and the production skills of Bill Laswell, and you end up with a very professional cross-over product, and certainly a very interesting mix. <br />Ellipsis Arts has a history of making beautiful music box sets. Like most of their products, Jali Kunda comes with a mid-format full-colour book of 96 pages, about the music, the people, the history, and the countries. Highly Recommended.	2001-11-26

For example: How to program panning and dynamics in MIDI (based on your chosen instrument and band); The layout and composition of various orchestra and bands; The range and other lookup information for a wide range of GM instruments.<br />The \\"Midi Orchestrator's Handbook\\" is a good companion to \\"Arranging Techniques for Synthesists\\" by Eric Turkel - which is a much beefier book.	2001-11-19

Compared to books such as &quot;Voluntary Simplicity&quot; by Duane Elgin and similar books, one realises that many of these ideas are nothing new when one reads Walden by Thoreau. In fact, what strikes me is that we as a Western society have not overcome many of the issues pointed out by Thoreau 150 years ago. Thoreau left Concord MA &quot;disdainful of America's growing commercialism and industrialism&quot;, the slavish materialism of that society then. One wonders what he'll say if he would see the extend today - in the post Coca-Cola society. But then Thoreau was a man who clearly stepped to his own drum. Becuase of slavery, he refused to support the state on moral grounds. How would his views have been tolerated today?<br />I am not luddite, but my favourite quote from the book is this: &quot;We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing to communicate&quot;. Does this say something about the Internet, newsmedia and our contemporary information overload, or what?<br />I liked the introduction and footnotes of Meyer. Just enough to provide context and explanation, but never intrusive. This book is as relevant today as it was during Thoreau's lifetime. Highly recommended.	2001-11-18

A series of clever observations, anecdotes and home truths, the book may be seen as controversial by some. However, the book is about effective leadership, creativity, courage and vision; and as such it should be compulsory reading for today's managers (along with Dilbert). Particularly in organisations ineffectively following the latest management fads, such as matrix management. <br />Mild critisicm. Nader does tend to go on a bit. The same message could probably have been given in less words.  Nevertheless, it is fairly inspiring Christmas holiday reading. Dale Carnegie, eat your heart out.	2001-11-18

Not quite a classic in the sense of Thoreau's &quot;Walden&quot;, and not a practical how-to like Dominguez and Robin's &quot;Your money or your life&quot;. First published in 1981, Voluntary Simplicity nevertheless offers a passionate and compelling arguement in favour of simplicity, frugality and sanity.<br />One can take the view that we can go living the way we are forever, but recent world events should point to the fact that that is an unrealistic dream. As the earth has its limits, so does the patience of the &quot;have-not&quot; nations we share the world with.<br />Voluntary Simplicity's message is relevant and eminently sensible. But with our culture's prevailing attitudes of greed and consumerism, it is easier said than done. Unfortunately the message seems lost on those who needs it most.	2001-11-18

Barnard is NOT a German living is South Africa as the Amazon review by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrongly states. Chris Barnard was born and bred in South Africa and lived there most of his life - though he did spend some years overseas. Barnard died earlier this year (2001), apparantly from an asthma attack.<br />I have just finished this book. Not completely what I expected, but quite useful nevertheless. I expected a sermon on diet and cholestrol, but the book is in fact much more. It covers a range of lifestyle strategies, such as avoiding diets, eating the right fats, drinking red wine, laughing and having fun, socialising, avoiding stress, activity and exercise, and enjoying sex.<br />The book is easy to read, and medical jargon is hard to come by. It is practical and straight-forward. I guess a lot of the advice is common sense, but sometimes one needs to have these points reinforced. Barnard reckons that he could have saved more people by educating them about lifestyle than by doing heart transplants. A point well worth considering.	2001-11-18

I originally purchased my copy when I started at Sybase as a new employee (though I had been using Sybase software for about 10 years prior to that). <br />I have had my copy now for nearly 5 years, and I still use it as much as ever - though I left the employment of Sybase a long time ago (so this is not an official endorsement). <br />And I'm not the only one in the office to use it - the book is a very good general reference on Sybase - forget the manuals. This book covers most things you want to know - whether you are a DBA or a developer, but perhaps not always in as much depth as you'll need.	2001-11-14

I bought this book to supplement &quot;Sybase SQL Server 11 Unleashed&quot; by Rankins etc. While that book is better as a general overview of Sybase, this book covers certain topics in more detail. <br />As such, Kirkwood's book is better suited to DBAs than developers. It covers topics such as integrity, cursors, datatypes, the threshold manager, auditing, security, backup and recovery, the optimizer, problem anticipation and solving, configuration parameters (useful!), creating databases, master database rebuilding, storage stuctures and indexing, multiuser issues (concurrency and memory) and other miscellaneous features.<br />Negatives? Some topics that one would expect to be covered here are missing. Still, for DBAs,  I would recommend this book to complement &quot;Sybase Unleashed&quot;. I generally use both.	2001-11-14

I wanted to understand more about this LDAP thing as a system designer (with a strong RDBMS background). Quite early on, the book explains the differences between directories, databases, file systems, FTP servers, DNS servers and Web servers.<br />I found the first 3 chapters well explained, and conceptual enough for my purposes. I do intend to go back and read &quot;Part II: Designing your directory service&quot;, though I probably skip the rest, which is more useful to implementors. (The rest of the book covers deployment, maintenance, using LDAP with applications, and case studies).<br />I found the book easy to read, and would recommend the book as a general overview of LDAP that covers many angles.	2001-11-14

It is well structured, well laid-out, and well written. At the same time it cuts the (...)found in so many heavy-duty management books.<br />Particularly useful are the templates found all through the book - and the CD with digital copies of them all.

This is the book that taught me Shell programming in the first place.

It is a bitesize and readable introduction to UML - and probably all you need if you prefer a lightweight approach to process - as I do. <br />Kendall Scott is the co-author of &quot;UML Distilled&quot;. I have since purchased Kendall Scott's &quot;UML Explained&quot; as well. I now use &quot;UML Explained&quot; as a quick reference. It is more suitable as such than &quot;UML Distilled&quot; - which is better when you need to know a bit more.<br />&quot;UML Distilled&quot; is a lean book without the fat, but not without the meat.

I never intended to - I got my job to purchased it as a reference for me. Lightweight processes are more appropriate in my professional circumstances (we don't use RUP), and I have been particularly interested in Rosenberg (and Scott)'s Iconix process. (See my reviews)<br />However, I find Krutchen's book a good fat-free reference on how the heavy-weights do it. Sometimes one needs a bit of extra depth. The book is well illustrated, and it helps me to put processes such as Iconix (and maybe even XP) in context.<br />The book covers the overall dimensions of the Rational Unified Process well. Issues such as best practice, iteration, team make-up, etc are also discussed. There is a big section on process workflow (more than 50%).<br />It also adds the architectural viewpoint of the process, a section that I found quite useful. Philippe Kruchten is behind the 4+1 view model of architecture, so it is good to get it from the source.<br />Should you buy this book? Like anything else, first decide how much you need it.	2001-11-13

I am not an implementor, yet wanted to understand more about this LDAP thing as a system designer (with a strong RDBMS background). So I only read the first 3 chapters - after that the book becomes heavy-duty detail level.<br />In summary, I found the first 3 chapters well explained, but not conceptual enough for me. It is written at a lower level, but sometimes a bit too simplistic. <br />Still, I would recommend the book for the implementor who is a beginner at LDAP. The book is vendor independent, and you'll learn much about recent market offerings.	2001-11-13

More than that, the book serves as a primer to both. Even if you already know UML or XML, you'll probably learn something new about each. References are supplied for those who want to learn more. For me, I also found that the book planted seeds for new ideas.<br />The material is presented in a practical way, around a simple business application. This makes the technologies more concrete and easier to understand. Fortunately, the reader is not overwhelmed by endless code listings - though there are enough nuts and bolts to make the concepts understandable.<br />Key concepts such as vocabularies, schemas, and portals are explained well. The book also touches on related technologies, such as RSS, XSLT, SOAP and UUDI. All in the context of a practical use case. I found the examples useful even if I design community based portals and not e-Business applications.<br />Hopefully the book will lay down the foundation for standards in schema development.	2001-11-12

I was impressed with Kendall Scott's clear writing style and the good examples. I also liked the introduction. It explains UML in the context of the unified process, with reference to architectural views.<br />This book is probably not all you want to know about UML. But it is a good, light-weight reference to the portions of UML you'll use most. It explains the what, when, and how.<br />Mr Scott will like me as well - I own 3 other books he has co-authored. The Fowler book (UML Distilled) covers the same ground, but it is more dense, with fewer examples. What is nice is that the examples in this book builds upon the examples of the second Rosenberg book. See my reviews on the Rosenberg books elsewhere.

So RUP is too big, and XP is too small. The Iconix process presented here is just right for most of our applications.<br />UML is a large language. About 20% of it is very useful.

It is also useful for the small business owner who has to look after their own design resources.	2001-06-03

This book should be mandatory reading for all those web-application programmers out there who are absorbed in the technology, but who sometimes forget that human-beings need to be able to use the tools that they are developing. (This review refers to the 1st edition of the book).	2001-06-03

I have used some of the nearly 400 illustrations in this book for various purposes, from website design artifacts to home decoration. Designs can be used at will. The designs are well categorised. North Africa and East Africa are not as well represented as the other parts of the continent, but you'll still find a good variety an this book's pages. Dates, and an index by region would have been useful.	2001-06-03
US	53072689	R1HHKCJNCT8YV9	0130274070	602960881	Software Architect Bootcamp	Books	3	6	6	N	N	A useful introduction and overview	I found this book [to be] useful... This is perhaps because I am newer to Software Architecture (I came to Architecture after a management stint lasting a couple of years). In addition I don't work in a Microsoft environment, but design open-source web applications. <br />So the target audience is not the very experienced software architect working in a Microsoft shop. But the technical content is useful even if the future of CORBA (and IDL) seems uncertain at the moment. Technically, the book complements my current studies of the design of distributed object systems. I liked the introduction to componentware. <br />I found many other aspects of the book quite interesting, for example the lightweight process presented, and the overviews of the other formal processes. It equipped me with the high-level knowledge I need to do my job. Talking about which - the description of the software architect's role in the organisation is another useful aspect of the book.<br />Negatives: As mentioned by many, the proofreading was not done well enough. As someone with technical leadership experience, it ran out of steam for me towards the end. And unfortunately, the process templates presented in the appendix were incomplete.<br />Still, I think that the book was a valuable read for me, and I now feel ready to tackle something more challenging, technically.	2001-05-26

This is surprising if one considers how many web sites are poorly organised and constructed. <br />The book is mainly about the organisation of information. Graphic artists and programmers will be disappointed, but people who are interested in designing usable websites for real people, should find this book valuable.<br />The book is presented as an introduction. To get deeper into any of the subjects covered, the reader will have to follow it up with other resources.	2001-05-26

Written in 1997, the authors considered the Internet and telecommuting as well. And it is nearly as relevant to Australia (where I find myself) as to the USA. Easy to read, it contains many useful hints, tables, and resources. Valuable questionaires and lists. What you should and what you shouldn't. What you need, and what you don't. Even so, we also had a &quot;First Try&quot;. But nothing ventured is nothing learned.	2000-11-08

Although this book was written in 1995-1996, it is worrying that  events that happened since were correctly predicted by the authors. A bit depressing, as another reviewer remarked, but the signs are there. &quot;Globalisation and fragmentation&quot;, as it is put in the book. As a professional couple, we will probably find a place amongst the 20% employed - for as long as the corporate masters need us anyway - should we be willing to follow the new corporate slogan of &quot;if you are awake, you are at work&quot;. And as someone who grew up in the so-called &quot;third world&quot;, I have seen a few sides of the argument. I would describe the book as &quot;sane&quot; rather than &quot;left-wing&quot;. One really has to put into question the value of &quot;democracy&quot; as persued by the Americans and others, on behalf of the large corporations. How much power do central governments really have these days? Thoroughly researched, well written, and informative. A must read.	2000-10-30

I have had the  first edition for 15 years now, and it is still one of my favourite cookbooks. Preparation time and cooking time are clearly indicated, and you'll find most ingredients in your pantry. Metric measurements will help. But apart from that, this IS fast food.	2000-10-28

It could have saved me much stress and grief. All the chapters were relevant - but for me, particularly the one about large-scale sites - I recognised many of the issues that I had to deal with. Knowing what I know now, I will deal with things much different next time.<br />It is a comfortable read, and I've read it cover to cover. Minor complaint: First person writing style eg: I will let my project-managers do x.<br />The CD-rom is not very useful. Old versions of crippleware, and incomplete documentation - for example the very important functional specification has bits missing. (Unfortunately there is not a printed copy in the book, and I could not find an update on the publisher's web-site either). The appendix about &quot;current&quot; technology is already dated (a year after publication).	2000-09-27

For me, as someone who grew up in South Africa, but on the other side of the line to the characters in the book, it opened up a window onto the lives of people of my old country - a window that was not there for me before reading the book. Scholtz is a master story teller, and you really get to know the people - in their own words. Highly recommended.	2000-09-27

It is a good &quot;how to&quot; on various levels, but also gives you the advantages and disadvantages of consulting - if you haven't made your mind up yet. But you may want to read other books for more in-depth coverage.<br />I haven't been contracting for 10 years, but have a stong desire to again do the work I like, for people I like, when I like - and get paid for it. Consulting is different to contracting of course, and Meyer discusses many of the new skills needed, for example setting up, marketing and pricing (he strongly recommends flat rate pricing for example) - and the very important listening skills. After reading the book, I have made my mind up. I am ready to chuck my permanent job.	2000-09-24

The book was obviously written by people with a lot of time on their hands. You'll find a lot of detail about changing money and  visiting markets in foreign countries, for example. Still, if you have  never travelled by cargo ship before, the book contains a lot of useful  information, particularly about accommodation and the lifestyle on board.	1999-07-09
