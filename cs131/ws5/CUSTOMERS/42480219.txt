I thought it was the best book I have ever read in my life. I really dont like books but when i read this book I get all into it and can relate in several ways. This book is a true diary about a fifteen year old girl. Who does several drugs and finds herself with the wrong friends and gets into a lot of trouble. She lives with her parents and has two younger siblings, Alex and Tim. Her family moves away from her Grandparents, whom are very close to her. She goe to visit them in the summer. <BR>   When she was invited to a party, thats when she had first tried LSD. Which is a very dangerous drug. She didn't know she had taken it because they were playing a game \\"Button Button.\\" <BR>    She wrote everything that had happened the first time she got high in her diary. This one drug lead into many more. She writes every issue that goes on in her life in this diary. There are many hardships in this book that she went through. In many ways I know a lot of teenagers can relate to her, and understand what she went through. I did and I enjoyed the book once you start you can't stop. There is many many problems in her life, and the only way you'll ever find out is if you read her diary. <BR>      Something very terrible happens to her in the end, it has to do with a pill. What happened to her?...Well read the greatest book ever and you will find out. Read Go Ask Alice, and you'll cry and laugh but most of all you'll put yourself in her shoes and say, \\" Wow she really had it tough. \\"<BR> <BR>             Thank you for your time in reading this. I really hope you get the chance to enjoy this book. Anyone can read it because you'll fall in love with this girl when you read her TRUE LIFE DIARY!<BR> <BR>              Heather Hendrickson	2003-11-07

I couldn't put it down.  The characters in the book such as Allegra Hanover, Andros Bliss, Derman Bloom, and Angie Sunberg were all very interesting.  Todd Strasser used fairly good forshadowing in the begining of the book.  I think this book is good for the female audience because it tells a guy's point of view of a girl's point of view.<BR>   The book is about how a girl spends the day before an asteroid is schedualed to hit.  It takes place around the town that Timothy Zonin High is in.  I liked this book alot because the main character, Allegra Hanover, had a personality similar to mine.	2003-11-07

The book used literally elements such as flashback, foreshadowing and irony.<br />A literally element used in this book is flashback. An example of flashback is when Dr. Donovan arrived and the girls had to tell him what happened during their experience with Lisa. Lisa Flashes back in the book to conversations she had with her parents. An example of this is when she told them she thinks she is going crazy. She also flashed back when she told her friends about her trip in the beginning of the book.<br />Foreshadowing was another literally element used in this book. It accrued mostly at the ends of chapters, the author would give clues as to if something good or bad was going to happen.<br /> Irony was in the book but you had to really look for it, it wasn't an obvious twist in the story. When you thought something was going to happen it didn't.. The first time she tried to commit suicide, she was in school and had to see the guidance Councilor, and he sent her on vacation instead of to a doctor.<br /> Though the book was well written, and used an assortment of literally elements, there is always room for improvements and in this case I believe the ending could have been better.<br /><br />Summary: Lisa, Bright and Dark was a creative book,. It seemed Lisa had everything: looks, boyfriend, friends and good grades. Over her high school career Lisa developed a mental illness, but no adults cared to see that.  When she goes to school some days she will have a \\"bright day\\" when she is in a good mood and talkative. Other days would be a \\"dark day,\\" and she would dress in all black and isolate herself from everyone. Lisa's friends, Betsy, Mary Nell (M.N) and Elizabeth decide to have help sessions in their houses and begin to diagnose her. Lisa's friend Elizabeth finds Lisa a doctor to help. Thought out this book Lisa attempted suicide several times and was never successful. I enjoyed this book and it's good if you want a short book to read, even though it seems to go on forever.yed this book and it's good if you want a short book to read, even though it seems to go on forever.	2003-11-04

His name is Nick Swansen and he knows that he is special ed student.  One day he decides to ask out a fellow classmate Shana to the prom.  The thing is special ed kids don't go to proms.  Shana had recently graduated from being in the class with Nick to a regular high school ciriculum.  Nick asks out Shana anyways.  Nick does a lot to make everything work out for the prom but that night everything went downhill from there.  Shana doesn't show up the whole night or even call Nick to let him know she wouldn't make it.  Nick started to have bad dreams again of his sister's death nine years ago and doesn't go to school for a few days.  Nick was doing a report on amphibians for his end of the year project.  After a while, he feels up to talking to Shana again after she stood him up.  She puts a few things together on how Nick likes amphibians and knows so much about them.  You'll soon see how everything comes together with Nick and he can finally put all his thoughts troubling him to rest.<BR>          <BR>         Some literly elements used in the book were:<br />Suspense-the book kept you waiting for more and willing to know what will happen next.<br />Mood-the book really expresses on how charcters feel throughout the story.<br />Personification-Nick sometimes gives certain human attributes to things that are not human.<br />            Overall I'd say this book was a great book.  I liked it because it related a lot on how teens deal with problems today and how some overcome their differences to figure out solutions.  There was only one flaw and that was there were intentional spelling and grammar errors that corresponded to Nick's vocabulary.  The book isn't in his pint of view.  You should read this book because it's easy reading and it's a good book to learn a lot from and relate to a lot of your own experiances.	2003-11-04

I think this book was very enjoyable to read.<BR>The start of this book begins when Billy Baggs, Mark Kenwood, and Suzy Langen go to watch a ballgame.  This ballgame takes place at the home of the Minnesota Twins.  At this game Billy gets hit with a ball and is given a glove from Jim Kaat a Professional baseball player.<BR>After the three of them get home Billy and King fight over Suzy who both love.  Now these two have to stay together for a week.  What will happen?<BR>Three literary elements that Will Weaver uses is the use of the climax, which is the first one.  I think the use of the climax is very good because I enjoyed reading it.  The climax is when Billy and Suzy make love.  The second literary element is the characterization chosen by the author.  I like the characters because I think they represent me.  The third literary element is the plot in which the events happen.  The part of the plot I like is when the kids go to the stadium.  I think the way the author used the events is very good.<BR>My opinion of this book is that this author writes very good books from reading this.  I think the characters he picked were very good such as Billy Baggs.  I think how King and Billy fight over a girl relates to some kids today.  I hope other people read this book also.	2003-11-04

Joseph Garber has hit a grand slam with this book that I would consider one of the best fiction book I have ever read.<BR>     As the protagonist, David Perry Elliot is finding out, there is a reason as to why the mercinary Ransome would like him dead.  After his boss tries to kill him and he survives a fire fight in the hallway of his executive suite at Sentrex Corp, he manages to make it to the second story dining hall.  But that is where he meets Ramsome and this time is able to get a pot shot with a pistol he got from one of Ramsomes team to land in Ransome's leg.  He is able to leave Sentrex after waiting until the cover of darkness and then proceeds to go to Marge's house.  Marge is a lady he meets after his run in with Ransome in the dining hall and she does give him the utensils to make a disguise.  But do you really think that Mr. Elliot, being an ex green beret, just left without preparing for a return?  He does set up booby traps that help him when he eventually returns after finding out the truth.  <BR>     There is one way that helps the reader tap into David's thought process and makes it possible to figure out why it is David is wanted dead.  Flashback.  Flashback is when an author will stray from current happenings of the book to go to an event in the past of a character.  Not only does it go back for a few days, but it goes back all the way to his days as a Green Beret in the Vietnam war to help him survive.<BR>     If one is a careful, attentive reader, you may pick up on the little hints the author drops to hint the truth.  These little hints are called foreshadowing.  These hints did help me find the reason why he is wanted dead, but only one page before Mr. Elliot himself finds out.<BR>     I would suggest this book to anyone who likes a book that will leave you winded even five minutes after the book has been closed.  If you want a book where by the end there are no secrets, this is the book for you.  If you want a book that is dull, boring, poorly written, and a book to put you to sleep, this is not the book for you.	2003-11-03

Do you find it hard to find a book that makes you want to keep reading? I usually have this problem too. At least I did before I found this book.<BR>The title of the book is Armageddon summer. The book was written by Jane Yolen and Bruce Coville.<BR> There are two main characters in the novel. Their names are Jed and Marina. The story revolves around these two and how they meet. The book is written as two stories and it combines into one at the end which is really good for getting to know what the other characters think. It takes place in a small mountain in Massachusetts called Mt. Weeupcut. They are up there because the reverend of there church, Reverend Beelson, tells them that the world is going to end. He believes that god is going to end the world on July 27th, 2000 and all the people that are not on Mt. Weeupcut will be fried in the flames. The problem is that there is only aloud to be 144 believers up on the mountain at that time. Reverend Beelson thinks god wants 144 because the two sacred numbers are three and four. Multiply them and you get twelve. Twelve and twelve is a 144. It becomes a problem when they have the required 144. There are angels with guns outside and electrical fences surrounding the area. This is so no one can get in or out. Reverend Beelson wants not one more or one less than the needed 144. The believers that get to the mountain too late are not aloud in and wait outside the gates yelling in and waiting for their chance to get in. You will have to read this book to find out what really happens. Will the world end or not? <BR>       The authors did a great job with this book. There is great characterization in the book. You really get to know the characters and get inside there minds. The authors also use irony in the novel. The ending came to a surprise to me but I really liked it. One more literary element that made this book so interesting was the mood the author sets. Its calm and happy through most of the book, but then it gets really loud and violent near the end and it makes it impossible to put the book down.<BR>       This is one of my favorite books. I really liked it because I could relate to on of the main characters so much. I could really tell what was in his mind and how he felt. I recommend this book to all readers. It is an easy book to read and it was written very well.	2003-11-03
US	42480219	R2YHT8RLUDI1YU	0141301244	376098327	Woman in the Wall	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Alex's Book Review	Patrice Kindl, author of \\"Owl in Love,\\" produces yet another captivating story with her newest release, \\"The Woman in the Wall.\\" The novel is written in first person, from the perspective of 14 year-old Anna Newland. Anna is not your typical teenage girl, though. Unlike her sisters, Andrea and Kirsty, who always seem to stand out, Anna wants just the opposite...to blend in. However, it's not people she wants to blend in with, so much as, the house. Or put more distinctively, the walls.<BR>Anna lived in an old Queen Anne Victorian that was more like a mansion than a house and was built in the 1880's. She resided there with her mother and two sisters. Andrea was three years older than Anna and Kirsty was two years younger, so Anna was the middle child. Their father disappeared when Anna was only three. Anna, though extremely shy, had always been a very clever child and by the age of seven she had not only learned to sew clothes, but was also very handy with tools. She never wanted any recognition for the things she did, in fact, it was her desire to go through life completely unnoticed. It was because of this retiring disposition that when Ms. Newland insisted Anna go to school, she hid. <BR>Anna created a small room out of plasterboard, lumber, and empty space that was actually just a room and passageway. The room was under the stairs and could only be entered through the basement. It had never been her intention to live there, just to have a secure hiding place but after an incident involving the psychologist from the school, Anna began coming out less and less. In fact, she built more and more secret passages. As time went on she only snuck out at night to get food. She had everything she needed within the walls and could go almost anywhere in the house, undetected. She went on this way for five years and though her mother protested, there was nothing she could do. <BR>After a while, Andrea seemed to forget all about her but Ms. Newland and Kirsty continued to speak to her through the walls occasionally. Two days before her fourteenth birthday Anna received a love letter through a crack in the wall, written to \\"A\\" and signed, simply, \\"F\\". Anna decided to write back but it wasn't until he wrote his next note that she realized \\"F\\" had meant the letters to be for Andrea. Meanwhile Anna had begun to fall in love with this mystery man, so instead of telling him the truth, she went on pretending to be Andrea, always signing the letters with \\"A\\".<BR>One day Anna overheard her mom talking to a man named Mr. Albright. It turned out that they were getting married and he wanted to move. Ms. Newland said she didn't want to move but couldn't tell him why. Being quite angry that her family had failed to mention this slight detail to her, Anna threw a huge fit and finally wore herself out. When she awoke she wasn't alone, someone else was in the wall with her. Two unexpected visitors bring startling news and Anna is faced with making a difficult decision: whether she should leave the sanctuary of the walls, the only home she's ever known or rejoin her family in the outside world once again.<BR>A fairly fast-paced book, I greatly enjoyed the author's usage of literary elements. Kindl's straightforward approach sets a somewhat relaxing tone in that we can all relate, to a certain extent, to this desire for acceptance and understanding. Her interpretation of how the main character responds to situations is undeniably realistic and is only enhanced by the offbeat sense of humor of her character. Written so that you never know what to expect, \\"The Woman in the Wall,\\" will hold your interest, through the climax, until very end.	2003-11-02

Callie doesn't really talk to anybody because she isn't really social. But the other girls always try to talk to her. <BR>Throughout this book, there has been some literary elements. One literary element is a flashback. Callie went back to where she was suppose to watch her brother Sam. She had to make sure that he ate dinner and then take his inhaler. Well, she went out of the room, and he started to have an asthma attack. She came and he was on the floor. The ambulance came and she regreted that time. Another literary element is foreshadowing. She keeps on thinking about getting out of Sick Minds and seeing her family together again. One more literary element is she uses imagery. Callie uses imagery by thinking about her, Sam, her mom and her dad sitting at the breakfast table all together. <BR>My personal opinion about Cut is I actually liked it! When I first got it, I didn't think I would like it that much. The title didn't really catch my attention, but when I read the back, I thought I might give it a shot. I really got into the book and whenI finished it, I loved it! All of my friends who read it, told me that it was a great book. Now I recommend it to everyone!	2003-11-02

It makes you want to read more and you won't get bored with it.<BR>     Foreshadowing helped this book. Although you never know what is gonna happen precisly you still know some what of what you are gonna read. This keeps the reader guessing then being surprised. <BR>     Irony was anonther element key to the book. You would think you know what was gonna happen next. It feels as if you know it. Then you read it and you were way off. I think this is the best part of the book. <BR>     Finally point of view was the most confusing but great factor of this book. In the beginning it is confusing but you will get the hang of it. It is another thing that draws you in.<BR>     In the book a boy named Bobby Pendragon gets asked bye his Uncle Press to go and help a city on their revolt for freedom. The city isn't much compared to their ruling neighbors but later in the book they find an explosive called tak. They made a huge bomb out of this and are to use it in the beginning of their battle againts their neighbors the Bedoowan. Are they actually gonna use the bomb. Will it be a success if so? Will this war actually happen. All these answers plus more will be answered only if you read this book.	2003-11-02

The Two Towers is the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. The book starts off in a forest where Orcs--evil creatures who act under the direction of Saruman--have been sent to find the Fellowship (which consists of hobbits--Frodo, Pippin, Merry, and Sam; two men--Aragorn and Boromir; an elf--Legolas; and a dwarf--Gimli), kidnap the hobbits, and bring them to Saruman--alive.<br />The main character, Frodo, is the bearer of the One Ring, created by Sauron, which holds an immense amount of power and evil. This is why the Orcs must capture the hobbits. The book had very good imagery included, giving us vibrant descriptions of the characters and scenes.<br />During the battle between the Orcs and the Fellowship, Boromir is shot with arrows while trying to save Merry and Pippin--who get kidnapped by the Orcs--and dies when Aragorn finally makes it to him. This really teaches a moral to the Fellowship, because Boromir had tried to take the ring from Frodo not much earlier.<br />Luckily, Frodo escapes from the Orcs and ends up heading towards Mordor (which is the one place that the ring can be destroyed) alone. That is, until his &quot;loyal servant&quot; Sam catches up and comes along. This splits up the plot, of whole flow of the story, into three different parts--Frodo and Sam trying to make it to Mordor, Merry and Pippin's attempts to escape from the Orcs, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's attempts to track down and find the Orcs to hopefully save Merry and Pippin.<br />Eventually, Frodo and Sam encounter the creature Gollum--or Sm&eacute;agol--who helps lead them to Mordor. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin escape the Orcs, heading off into the Fangorn Forest, where they meet Treebeard and the other Ents (tree-like, living, talking, walking creatures).<br />I like this book because the way J.R.R. Tolkien writes is very creative, as are his ideas. In it a whole new world is created, where there is a seemingly endless war going on. I loved the fantasy elements and the new creatures and places. The whole concept just adds to the great sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring.y elements and the new creatures and places. The whole concept just adds to the great sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring.	2003-11-02

Congradulations to Jenny Davis for writing a terrific novel that can touch the heart of anyone.<BR>  The main characters are David Kindler, Livvie Sinclair, and Maggie Parker. Livvie is new to her school and she knows no one. David intruduces himself in their Biology class. Their teacher Mrs. Fulton devoted the first semester of the class to sex-ed. The class was assigned projects. Their projects are to care for someone who they don't know. Really care for someone. David and Livvie decide to work together because they feel that their new neighbor Mrs. Maggie Parker could use a little caring for. After all she is pregnant. Livvie and David rush to her house right after school and they will stop at nothing to try and keep Maggie and her baby healthy. The only problem is Maggie's husband, Mr. Parker. He doesn't want anyone medaling around in his or his wife's buisness. Livvie and David go against his will and still go to Maggie's house but leave before the mysterious Mr. Parker arrives home from work. He never was a happy camper. He never greeted them. Not once. Finally, Mrs. Parker had a lovely baby. Thanks to David and Livvie. They completed their assignment.<BR>  But while this was all going on, David and Livvie began to fall in love. They shared the best of moments together. They were both very sensitave, loveing, and caring people. Livvie came off as shy at first but grew to be a little outgoing.<BR>  I found that this book had a surprise waiting around every corner. But it was the ending that really got me thinking.<BR>  In conclusion i would just like to say I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!	2003-11-02

Since Shan is an adult now, the whole book is a flashback to his youth.A flashback is when the author describes something from the past.  The first five Cirque Du Freak books are filled with action, adventure and violence.  Shan's sixth book will not disappoint.  The climax of the story is a very graphic war between the vampires and vampanese ( the vampire's enemy).  A battle that could decide the fate of both groups.<br />Darren's The Vampire Prince tells about an act of treachery commited by one of the most respected and trusted in the vampire clan.  This is irony at it's best.  Irony is an unexpected twist in the story.  Exposing the traitor may save Darren's life, after he escaped from the Trials of Initiation.  The trials were tests to see if Darren would prove himself worthy of being called a half Vampire.  If you do not pass the trials you will be taken to the Halls of Death and executed.<br />The great detail, excellent character development and overall extraordinary writing of author Darren Shan will leave you not only satisified, but begging for more.<br />A great book and you don't even have to read the first five books in the series to understand The Vampire Prince.  Thanks to a prologue, you will get caught up on all five books in only three pages.<br />Check it out!!!!!	2003-11-02

His father is a famous astronaut named Alan York, his mother is always defending him, and his sister Sarah could not be more involved with her curricular life. They are one happy family, living in their cozy, Cocoa Beach home.<BR>     <BR>Then a tragic divorce sends Steve to Houston to live with his father, and Sarah to San Diego to live with his mother. Now Steve has to go to a new school, make new friends, and start a new life. But the constant arguing with his father, which he refers to as the \\"astronaut\\", isn't helping the situation.<BR>     <BR> Steve soon becomes involved with a group called \\"GOD\\", also known as The Grace Order of Daidists. This is a group representing an unusual and creative form of art. He develops many friendships such as his best friend Doug Chappel, and his teenage love and girlfriend Wanda, or \\"Dub\\" Varner. As Steve and Dub become closer and develop a relationship, he drifts away from GOD and his friends, until the point where his life becomes Dub.<BR>     <BR>GOD soon falls apart, and Steve and Doug throw away their friendship over a fight. To make matters worse, the astronaut has a new girlfriend which seems to anger Steve. On his summer trip to visit his mother and sister in San Diego, he realizes that he is distancing himself from Dub, and he soon finds out that she has cheated on him with their english teacher Mr. Waters.<BR>     <BR>At this point Steve can't deal with the pain and anger, so he completely leaves his life in Houston at the end of his junior year to go live with his mother and Sarah in San Diego. He completely throws his life away with drugs and alcohol, and his life totally changes. Towards the end of his senior year Steve's guidance counselor gives him the opportunity to write a hundred page essay about anything he wants to write about, to make up an english credit. Steve decides to write a paper about his life.<BR>    <BR> I think that this book is great for teenagers because it explains the daily problems of life, and it's easy to relate. The journalistic way of the book makes it interesting how two times of his life could have been so different. The constant flashbacks of Steve's life make you think of how it changed so much. This book also shows a lot of foreshadowing which gives clues as to what decisions Steve will make, and how his story is going to end.	2003-11-01
US	42480219	R27NBMUQFET2GI	0440220343	532427042	Tenderness (Laurel-Leaf Books)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Rachel Goss	If growing up as a teen and all the problems and stress wasn't enough, Lori, had to deal with obsessions, her mother's relationships, and older men.  Lori is 15 years old and has blonde hair and blue eyes.  She has a very grown up body, so she looks older than she actually is.  Eric Poole is 17 years old and a \\"monster,\\" recently released out of jail.  Lori and Eric are both in search of the same thing, tenderness.<BR>  Lori ran away from home, well technically she didn't run away.  Lori told her mom that she was going to visit her two friends, Martha and George in Wickburg.  There weren't actually two friends in Wickburg but she told her mother that so she wouldn't worry.  Wickburg is where Lori and her mother used to live.  Lori has never been settled in a house for a long period of time because of her mother's relationships.  From abusing boyfriends to boyfriends who just don't care her mom has been through it all.  Gary was her mom's new boyfriend.  Gary was good to her mom and she felt that she might mess that up because Gary tried to touch Lori.  Lori didn't want to ruin the one good thing her mom had she decided to get away for a while. <BR>  Lori has this thing, she calls them obsessions and they don't stop until she kisses the person.  She was obsessed with Eric Poole.  She saw him on the T.V. on the day he got out of jail.  She knew she had to kiss him.  She had a flashback of a day by the rail road tracks.  She remembered seeing him with a girl.  Eric stuck up for her and she remembered his smile.  This was also an example of foreshadowing.  I think it is an example of foreshadowing because if she brought it up normally it means something's going to happen that has to do with it.<BR>       Another element used is imagery.  A good example is when they are at the lake.  \\"I love the breeze on my face, the smell of the air and the water, never realized that water actually has a smell to it, clean and fresh, and Eric is handsome as he paddles the canoe, shifting the paddle from one side to another, and I half-close my eyes, squinting at him, and he looks at me with an expression on his face that I can't really pin down.\\"  I can exactly picture and have a specific smell of what it was like.<BR>  Eric was known for being tender with girls and then killing them.  But with Lori it was different.  She would often tell Eric how she loved him.  He took her on a shopping spree and bought her everything she wanted.  He took her on a canoe like she always wanted to.  She was so excited and when she was on the canoe she screamed how she was the happiest girl in the world.  But something awful happened, she lost her balance.  You'll have to read the book to find out if Eric attempted to save her or just let her drown. <BR>        I really liked this book because it always kept me reading.  I normally don't like to read but with this book it was different.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat in a way wondering what's going to happen next.  Also, there were many surprises like the ending was a total surprise to me.	2003-11-01

I read the book Someone like you by Sarah Dessen.I really enjoyed this book a lot.<BR>   My book has two main Charecters in it. The first Charecter in my book is Halley. Halley is a normal teenager that faces every day problems like her parents, school,work and boys. Halley's mom thinks it's a good idea for her to go to a sisterhood camp over summer vacation. She falls in love with a boy named Macon. Her parents don't quite approve of him,but she dosen't care. The second charecter is Scarlett Thomas. Scarlett lives at home with her mother. Scarlett seems to find herself in a lot of trouble. She meets this boy named Michael Sherwood and falls in love with him. She soon finds out that she is pregnet with his baby. Scarlett also finds out that Michael has been killed in a motorcycle accident. She relises she needs Halley a lot because with out her she would have nobody. Scarletts mom wants her to give the baby up for adoption.As the year goes on Halley and Scarlett relise they need each other more then ever.The story takes place in a small quite town called Lake view.  <BR>   Some literary elements that were used by the autor were things like imagery. At certain points in the book the details she was giving were great. When Halley and Malcon were at the top of a cliff she described it and it almost felt as if I were there. The setting of the Book was very exact.She decribed how looking out of Halleys window you could see Scarlett fron across the street. The author also told how the yards looked and the houses in her neigborhood looked. Sarah Dessen describes her charecters in every detail. She gave everything from how they look to evey little thing they do in specific detail. <BR>    I personaly thought Someone Like You was a great book. I liked it most of all because it deals with some issues that teens face everyday. Like getting pressured to have sex and girls at sixteen getting pregnet. The girlScarlett still manages to go to school and do the things she does everyday. Halley learns that getting pressured to have sex isn't something that is just going to go away. I would recommend this book to teenage girls.I think they would find this book interesting and hopefully they would recommend it to someone else.	2003-11-01

What happenes is this guy named Jason Cole is a terrorist, and is blowing up trancars and bridges. He disguises himself as &quot;Spring&quot;. He told the FBI that if they didn't give him $5Million in cash then he would blow up the whole New York City. One of the FBI agents named Karen takes matters into her own hands. She decides to pretend to be this women named Robin. She heard of the guy Spring and told him she would like to go on a date with him. He calls her and tells her where to meet him at. So she gets a rental car and buys a new outfit, to fit the description of Robin. She drove to the place spring told her to meet him at. She was waiting at a red light when someone opened the door, got in and another guy had her at gun point. The other guys name is Donny. He had cole tell her where to go. They drove all the way to Ithica, and Donny had the gun to her head the whole time.<BR>Cole made her drive to the middle of nowhere. He had an abandoned house back there. By this time no one knew where Karen was. One of the other agents got information about this &quot;Spring&quot; guy and drove up to his house, the agents name was Meisner. Donny had a feeling someone was there. So he hid until he heard him come near the house. All of a sudden there was a knock on the door. &quot;Hello,anyone home&quot;? Cole heard the door open slowly , but he could barely see because of the darkness. Then he heard a shot and donny came running. Then out of coles mouth came an evil laugh.<BR> You'll have to read the book to find out what happens to Karen, Donny, and Spring.<BR>  These are the literary elements the author used; Foreshadowing, surprise ending, and conflict.<BR> For foreshadowing he gave hints about spring and you always knew when he was going to blow something else up.<BR> The surprise ending wasn't what I expected it to be. I can't tell you what happens so you'll have to read the book!<BR> and for the conflict spring has a problem with the FBI and wants $5million or he'll blow up the city.<BR> Foreshadowing- The use of clues that suggest events that have yet to occur.<BR> Surprise ending- a conclusion that violates the expectations of the reader.<BR>Conflict- A struggle between opposing forces<BR>  <BR> I really liked this book because you never knew what was going to happen next unless the author used foreshadowing, it made you wanting to read more.	2003-10-29

By Terry Brooks is an amazing book.<BR>Magic Kingdom For Sale Sold! is about a lawyer, Ben Holiday, wanting a challenge, wanting excitement. What started this wanting was his wife dying in a car crash two months pregnant with their first child. He isolated himself from social events, drinking more, and just going from work to home every day. Than one cold day he was getting the mail and saw a magazine that his wife used to look at all the time. While looking through the Rosen's magazine that night while drinking his favorite drink found an ad selling a magical kingdom with dragons and damsels, knights and knaves. After talking with his friend Miles ( who thinks it's a fake ) about the ad decided to go to New York to meet the mysterious seller of the kingdom ( who is  Meeks ). After he met with Meeks, Ben has a week to decide if he wants to waste one million dollars on a fairy tale kingdom that might not even be real.

This book has wonderful imagery and it just takes you away. After you read this book you should read the rest of the series, The Black Unicorn, Wizard At Large, The Tangle Box and Witch's brew.	2003-10-28

The main character is Haven McPhail.  She is a sophmore in her school and loves to shop.  Haven lives with her mom and has one sister, Ashley.  Once a week Haven goes to dinner with her dad that lives close by. <BR>                Haven and Ashley are very different!  Ashley is always the best, better or greatest at everything.  She is pretty, cute and has a well balanced figure.  Haven is tall, unporportioned, and dealing with adolencent problems.  Ashley is a material girl and throughout the book is stressing about her wedding.  Lewis is Ashleys fiance and is not too much fun, from Haven's perspective.  Haven's favorite of all Ashley's borfriends is Sumner Lee.  He went on vacation  with their family to Virginia when Ashley and him were together.  <BR>                 Haven and Ashley's mother is energetic and lively.  She always knows what is wrong and what is right- like every mother knows.  Also she is the first person to know that something is up.  Their father is a News broadcaster for the local television channel.  His newly married wife is the weather forecaster for the same channel.  Her name is Lorna Queen, but most people call her the weather pet.<BR>                Sarah Dessen, the author, expresses the moods of the characters and describes their reaction very vividly.  She uses the best techniques to wirte with expression.  Sarah Dessen also paints a qicture of the scene in your head.  This use of imagdry is very helpful throughout the book.  Also it makes the characters come to life.  \\"I went down stairs and opened the door.  Sure enough, there was Lewis in one of his trademark skinny ties and oxford shirts.\\"  Quoted from the book this is an example of the way she paints a picture.   <BR>                Another writing technique she uses is irony.  Throughout the book she mentions and describes in great detail a certian person.  At the end of the book we realize how that character isn't who we thought he /she was.  This change in a person's identity was a large use of irony because it changes most people opinions about this person.  The author is an excellent writer and should write more books with the same theme.  She also is good at describi ng feelings of problems and adolencence.<BR>                   My opinion of this book is that it is very good.  I couln't put it down.  Everyday had an issue I could relate to.  Other people deffinately could relate to this book too.  This book shows the challenges of an average tennage girl and how she deals with them.  Today I could use some of her stratagies to make my problems easier.	2003-10-26

As you know I read the book, You Know You Love Me, by Celicity von Ziegesar, in the Gossip Girl series. Personally I felt that the book really touched upon a lot of things that real high school students face every day of their lives. I would know since I am one of those many high school students.<BR>      One of the things I loved about the book is deffinatley how it sort of makes you think about how much the characters in the book, are really like you in one way or another. For example, Blair is very much like me. She has some idea of what she wants out of life, but is more conserned about what her boyfriend thinks of her, and how her hair looks, than going to college. What she doesn't know is that her boyfriend Nate is cheating on her with a freshman in their high school. <BR>      The girl's name is Jenny and she is so happy to be going out with a senior, that she totally forgets that this senior is Blair's boyfriend. When she finally realizes this, she is to attached to Nate to let him go, so she just sits back and thinks that things are over with Nate and Blair.<BR>      Now that you know three of the characters, let me give you the last two! Dan and Serena! Blair and Serena used to be best freinds, up until the point that Serena got kicked out of school, and came back a totally different person. Now Blair's mom is getting married, and guess who's one of the brides maids? Serena! Will the two of them get along? I'm not going to tell you, you'll have to read the book! Now meet Dan.<BR>      Dan is in love with Serena, but he gets the feeling that she just likes him as a friend. On a weekend trip to colleges with her, and former best friend Nate, Blairs boyfriend, another reason for the hatred between Serena and Blair, he'll find out about the real Serena. What will he think after that? You'll have to find out for your self!<BR>      I loved all of the suspense between all of the chracters in the book, and all also like how everything flows together in it. One thing I didn't like was how each chapter was about a different person, but after a while you got used to how they moved from person to person.<BR>      I loved this book, and I hope that after reading this book review, you'll go out and read it too!	2003-10-24

King catches Billy and Suzy making out in Billy's barn and king and Billy have a big fight over it. The coach and both of the kids parents decided that the best for this not to happen again was to make them become friends so they had to spend more time together so they had to suspend the whole week together which include of sleeping over at each others houses. But this would never help the fathers become friends because they were enemies as well. The author used the many literary elements some of the ones were similes metaphors and those were the only ones I picked up on.	2003-10-21

The title of the book is Demon Seed, and the author's name is Dean R. Koontz.<BR>      There are many different ways that the author used one specific writing element and that element was personification, but the only thing about that is that the personification was always to one thing and that thing was the computerized house. In the book there are two main characters. The two main characters are Susan and her husband's creation Adam two. The main setting of the story is in Susan's mansion. The plot is w hen Adam two took over Susan's house he wanted to have a human body. The way that I feel about this book is that all together it was a great book. My favorite part was when the house got Susan to go down to the basement and she didn't know where she was going.	2002-10-30

This book is about a family trying to cope with the fact that there son shawn is mental and can not speak at all. Shawn thinks that his father wants to end his pain because he talked about it and he shows signs all the time. In the book his father interviews a man on trial for killing his own son because he was mental as well as shawn is. The man on trial said he didn't kill his own son, he ended his suffering as he said that Shawn's father agreed. They both said no one's child should suffer no matter what happens or what you need to do to end it weather you kill them or not. As the book goes on Shawn's brother and sister begin to wonder if their father was planning on doing that to their brother Shawn. Both said that their father would have to go through them to get to Shawn.This is a very good book. I prefer everyone to read it whenever they have the extra time to sit and read a good book like this one. This book is very interesting and has many good parts that i'm sure you'll want to read about expecally the ending. If you have time and want to know what happened at the ending of this story then go to your closest libary and ask for the book \\"Stuck In Neutral\\" by Terry Trueman.<BR> <BR>                                              By: Nicole Moore	2002-10-30

This was one of the best books I have ever read.  The book is a teenage love story.<BR> This book was about two high school sweet hearts that fell in love in eighth grade.  The characteristics name was Julie Ellis and Luke Mulderhower.  Luke was a talented football player and he was going to receive a football scholarship.<BR> The coach of the high school football team was Bud Ellis, the team was called Indians Watertown Warriors.<BR> Julie and Luke were always together. One day Luke and Julie were hanging out and Luke was looking sick and he was very pale and very skinny.  Julie decided to take him to a doctor. When they both went to the doctor, he tells them both that it's a virus, and he should come book for check up.  The whole way he goes to doctors for check up Julie is by his side the whole.  The illness he goes through it's very deadly. Luke had another check up and Luke never went to it because he didn't want to hear the same thing he heard from he's last check up.  So Julie and Luke's mother went to the doctor with Luke to see how he's last check went and the doctor told them that he never went to his last one and if he went they could of help him get better. Julie and Luke's mother was very mad.  They didn't understand why he didn't go. But the doctor told Luke that he would get better and could return back to school.  Luke already knew the medical that he was taking was making him sicker.  He was tried of being this way so he stop taking everything the doctor told him to take. <BR> I thought this book was very interesting but there was one thing that should of never put the way it was They should of told the reader when and was Julie right by his side like she promised him. I would say the ending was not a surprised but you do get into the book.  In my case I didn't want to put the book down, I want to read the book and read more that happen for example did Luke get his scholarship to play football and another question did Luke and Julie stay together. But your have to find out for your self.<BR> I recommend this book to anybody who likes a love story and sad ending.  This book had a lot of details and I know if you read it, it would be one of your favorite books.	2002-10-30

From the beginning to the end you could not really predict the next move of any character.  <BR>   The main charcter was a teenage girl around fourteen years old, her name is Teddi.  Teddi at first looses her mother to cancer, then since her father can't handle it he commits suicide right in their garage where Teddi would easily find him.  While her mom was dying, her next door neighbor Mamie would help take care of her.  So when both of Teddi's parents died Mamie didn't want to let Teddi go into foster care she made a deal with social services so Teddi could stay with Mamie.  While Teddi lived with Mamie, Mamie's son Daniel died in a horried plane crash.  Not even living with Mamie for a total of six months Teddi's life changed dramaticaly.  When one day the door bell and Mamie's daughter-in-law shows up pregnant.  Teddi is very suspicous on why Mamie was never told that her son was married or about to be a father.  Mamie was thrilled because she thought she would never see her son again but with a granson coming there would be a part of her son in him. The women's name is Dora.  Even though Dora is pregnant she is very lazy and thoughtless.  Once the baby comes it's a boy named Danny after the father.  Dora starts to do more when the baby comes not that's it's good.  She steals money from Mamie and sneaks away from home at night to who knows where.  Meanwhile in Teddi's old home a new family moves in.  There are three kids none her age but a boy about 3 or 4 years older. They become friends and start hanging out together playing tennis.  His name is Jason.  He even begins to be suspicous of Dora.  <BR>    The ending has a twist to it and the truth comes out.  In certain parts of the book you can see what the author is saying because the author is using excellant imagry.  A lot of irony was used.<BR>    I would recommend this book to anybody not only because it's an excellant book but because escepically teenagers can relate to this book.  Most teens don't like to read but this would just take them away from the world and into the book.	2002-10-30

This book is really easy to get into and I've found it to be very interesting. This on going plot has scenes about action, a little bit of romance and a lot of sentimental family values.<BR>  S.E Hinton describes the characters so perfectly so that you can get an exact picture in your mind. Thought the main plot of this book happens over a short period of time, it is so detailed and full of adventure<BR>  The narrator of this book is the main character Pony Boy Curtis. He gets comments on his name because it sounds more like a nickname. Ponyboy is a 14 year old boy who lives with his two older brothers Darry and Sodapop Curtis. The eldest of the two was Darry. He looked over his younger brothers since he was stronger and the wisest. The second eldest was Sodapop. He kind of looked out for mainly Ponyboy too and usually stayed on his side when he and Darry got into arguments. Sodapop was a high school dropout because he had to help Darry with the bills because their parents got into a car accident a while back so Soda works long hours in a auto body shop. The Greasers (Which they call themselves) had a family outside of their own like Johnny and Two Bitt. The greasers got their name because they usually wore a lot of hair gel and they live on the east side of town which the poorer side.<BR>  The Soc's, which are the total opposite of the greasers, live on the west side of town. They are mainly upper class rich kids that cause a lot of destruction and like to get into fight with the Greasers throughout the book.<BR>  Don't equate the cover of the book with the quality because the book reads much better than the cover looks. This book really proves that you can't judge a book by its cover.	2002-10-30

The book wasn't filled with the excitement of Interview with A Vampire.<BR>   Lestat, the main character, is a vampire who does not like being a vampire, yet he \\"likes the hunt\\" of draining the blood from humans. David is Lestat's best and only friend.<BR>   This book takes place in many different settings. The book starts off in Miami, then he goes to Amsterdam to follow David.<BR>   The plot of this book is basicly Lestat's journal. Lestat is going from various places doing things. He is in Miami when he kills a serial killer that prays on the weak and elderly. Then Lestat goes to Amsterdam to tell his friend David that he is going to the Gobi desert to kill himself. He went to the Gobi desert and awaited the sun, but when it came, he went through two days of awfull pain but he survived. From there he returned to David's untill he was able to leave.<BR>   There were few well written literary elements that Ann Rice made an attempt at writing. The plot description was excellent, however, like when she described the snow covered back streets of Amsterdam. Also she did a great job of discribing the bar where Lestat wrote a letter to david, apolgizing for the way he left him to go to the Gobi desert. Ann Rice did an okay job of describing irony, like when Lestat made David into a vampire. There wasn't much suspence to this book, it was very predictable.<BR>   My personal opinion of this book is that it was not a very good vampire books. When I think of vampire books I think of vampires fighting vampire hunters or anything where there is an enemy of some kind. This book is for the very patient and who likes to sit and read about the details of about a ten minute scene that takes fifty pages to describe, I am not one of these people. Yet I did liked when Lestat turned David into a vampire and the surprise ending. I recomend this book only to people who have a strange infatuation with vampires.	2002-10-30
US	42480219	RBBX8GJUO2EDJ	0590409433	33953133	Fallen Angels	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Fallen Angels	The book Fallen Angels, by Walter Dean Myers, is one of the best books I have ever read. The setting is in Vietnam in the late 1960s. It's mainly about what happens to the main character, Richard Perry's, squad. The narrator is Richie.<BR>   The conflict is man verses man because they're fighting the Vietnamese. Along with Richie is his best friend, \\"Peewee\\" Gates, Monaco, another friend, and Lieutenant Carroll. There are also many other soldiers in Richie's squad. Peewee is the \\"clown\\" of the squad who isn't afraid of anything. Monaco is sort of like the priest in the squad because he is always praying. Then there is Lieutenant Carroll, who Richie thinks is always sad and depressed, even when he laughs or smiles. Richie is fresh out of high school and is scared for his life. He is an African American from Harlem, New York.<BR>   Richie is scared at first, but when not much action happens in the beginning, he starts to calm down. It doesn't last long though, because soon they go into combat. After that, almost every time they go out, someone dies. This includes one of Richie's friends who everyone in the squad liked and respected. One day when the squad goes to fight, Richie gets injured. He thinks he is about to die, but he doesn't.<BR>   The author used many literary elements in the book, such as monologue. An example of it was made by Lieutenant Carroll. He said,\\"My father used to call all soldiers angel warriors because usually they get boys to fight wars.\\" This quote is what goes on through the book and what the characters use to make up their prayers whenever someone in the squad dies. He also used a lot of imagery to explain the first man's face that Richie shot, and their location such as in forests, cemetaries or rice paddies.<BR>   The book Fallen Angels is an outstanding novel. The author makes you feel as if you were in Vietnam and part of the characters. It gets you emotionally involved too. There are times when you feel like laughing or even crying. You can feel the fear and the sweat that comes down your face as you get nervous waiting to see what happens next. I definatly think everyone should read this book because it is very realistic.	2002-10-30

When he described the basketball games, he used so much imagery that it would feel like you were actuall yin the game and playing it. He left me in suspensea lot throughout the novel too. He would almost tease you with the words. Characterization was also used frequently when two people would be talking and you could just picture the characters facial expressions because described them so well.<BR>Rich Wallace is a very good author. I am sure I will read more of his books in the future. I gave this book five stars because of the authors wonderful imagery and literary talent.	2002-10-29

This book is basically about a girl named Lisa who's 16 and has a disease that will affect her life forever. The disease she has is called schizophrenia. This affects her life in many ways. She seems like a normal teenage girl. She's pretty, popular, and has a boyfriend. But all this changes when this disease affects her. But no one really believes that she has this disease because she seems so average, no-one suspects she could be losing her mind. She tries to tell her parents there's something wrong with her, but they don't believe her and don't listen to her asking for help. But she changes a lot, her friends can tell there's something wrong with her. She has her bright days and her dark days. But she doesn't really try to talk to them about what's wrong with her. She just keeps to herself and pushes everyone else away. She doesn't even try talking to her boyfriend. She doesn't try talking to anyone or telling anyone else about this but asking her parents for help but they don't give it to her.	2002-10-29

It mostly talk about how teenagers live and what they do when they go some place and what they do when hanging out with each other. Well, a lot of people think this book is about people doing stuff in their relationship, because of the cover, but that's not true.

I think the plot is very good and keeps to you onyour toes, but the begining of the book can be a little slow but if u sick with it you'll enjoy it. I didn't enjoy the book too much at first but then it got very interesting and seems very real. I really enjoyed the fact that it has to do with modern daytime and true sencearials these days	2002-10-29

Although it has some flaws, it is still very interesting.  It's well written in most parts and you can get a feeling of what the main character is thinking at times.  This book should have a strong connection with kids tat have been in a foster parent's care, even though the experience in the book isn't positive.  I do not recommend this book to anyone under the age of twelve because of the content inside it.  <BR> Janie or Leshaya, as she is later called, was abandoned by her heroin-addict Mama Linda at the age of four.  While Janie was swimming in the Gulf of Mexico, her Mama Linda is getting high and doesn't pay attention to Janie when she starts to drown.  Janie get put into a hospital, and when she is released she get put into a foster home with Patsy and Pete in Alabama.  In this house she meets another foster child named Harmon, an African-American who introduces Janie to \\"the ladies\\", whose music churns her sole.  This music inspires Janie to sing, at times that's the only thing that she can think about.  Harmon and Janie became good friends, being around Harmon made Janie think that she was an African-American and that she was just \\"light\\".  Harmon's and Janie's social worker, Doris, is the only other that Janie talks to.  When Harmon gets adopted and Doris's daughter, Leshaya, dies Janie is left all alone.  In honor of Leshaya, Janie changes her name and decides to be Leshaya.  <BR> One day when Leshaya is coming home from school, Mama Linda appears and she takes her away.  Leshaya knows that she is being kidnapped, but she doesn't care since she is with her mother.  Little does she know that her mother actually sold her for heroin.  She then goes to live with her new \\"parents\\" Daddy Mitch and Mama Shell, who later on get arrested for [illegal substance].  Leshaya takes some of the profits that Daddy Mitch made selling heroin and runs away before the police can come and put her back into Patsy's and Pete's house.  She finds where Harmon lives and decides to invite herself to live with them for a while.  Once she ruined her friendship with Harmon and his family, she runs away again and meets up with a band.  This band is Leshaya's first big break, people actually get to hear her sing and this makes Leshaya gets into bigger things. During some turning with a band, Leshaya gets pregnant and when she gives birth to the baby she gives it to Harmon, even though he isn't the father.  Leshaya becomes [an] addict at the age of fourteen and start not to care about life anymore.  Leshaya has a lot to deal with in her life, but can she make the right decisions?<BR> Noland uses a lot of literary elements in this book.  She does a great job with the plot of this book.  The story is well thought out and planed.  The imagery in this book is really good, sometimes you can actually get the feeling that you are Leshaya and you're suffering as much as her.  For example, you could really feel the pain Leshaya was going through when she had to give up her daughter.  I think that this novel is just like the blues; it makes you feel sad and alone, but yet sympathetic for the character.  <BR> I really started enjoying this book at the end, the last two chapters to be exact, because the author finally got to the resolution of the book.  The part that I didn't like about this book was the way the author portrayed the character.  Leshaya was, at first, an admirable person, but hen she turned into a self-centered ... addict.  Another thing I didn't enjoy was that the author made Leshaya use improper English and that made it confusing at times.  Despite all the negative parts to the book, overall, it was very interesting.  You can really get the feeling of what some kids are feeling.  I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone, young or old.  It has great ideas on what young foster children are going through.	2002-10-29

This book is about a young girl, Hannah Ziebarth, who loses her virginity to her first love, Milo Fabiano, and gets pregnant.  On top of that, she has been through a lot of changes in the past two years.  Her father suddenly passed away and now her menatlly ill mother won't leave the house or pick up the phone.  Hannah is left to deal with taking care of her mom, the house, herself, and pretty soon, a new baby.  This is a lot of pressure for a 15 year old to deal with and one night after Milo denies being the father of the baby and beats her up, she has a \\"psychotic episode.\\"  Before she knows it, she's shiped off to the psych ward of the local hospital.  There she meets \\"Poppy Seed,\\" her drunken roommate.  Together they try to survive hospitalization and help eachother understand the meaning of life.  This book deals with teen pregnancy, mental illnesses, love, friendship and family.  i thought it was an excellent book because it discussed some issues teens deal with today, and the author used wonderful imagery to help you understand the emotions of the story.  i think the plot was well devloped and never once did I not understand what was going on.  I really enjoyed reading this book and felt that many teenagers could realte. I strongly reccommend this book.	2002-10-29

The main characters are Halley, the narrator, and Scarlett, Halley's best friend. They have problems with boys throughout the novel, but they still are friends.<BR> The main event in the story was Scarlett's pregnancy. The father, Michael, got killed in an accident on his motorcycle the day after she gotten pregnant. Scarlett told Halley in September, a month after, when she was sure she was pregnant. Her mother wanted her to have an abortion, but she decided to keep it. That was the most interesting part of the plot throughout the whole book. <BR> On the first day of school, Halley had met Macon, who was the popular guy. He wanted to be friends with her. Soon they became boyfriend and girlfriend, and were really close. Halley's mother didn't want her to see him, so she had to sneak out to meet him after school.<BR> One day, Macon wanted to go \\"all the way\\" with her but she said she didn't want to end up like Scarlett. On New Years Eve, Halley went to a party with him and got drunk. Macon tried to go \\"all the way\\" with her again, but she rejected him because she got sick. When he drove her home after the party, he was so upset because she didn't go \\"all the way\\" that they got into a car crash. They lived, but Halley was very injured. Also in the middle of the book, Halley's grandmother was sick in the hospital, and Halley had to go see her.<BR> The literature element that the author used was imagery, mood, setting, suspense, and surprise ending. I can't say why it's a surprise ending, but it's a very good ending. The imagery is when she tells what is happening around her, you can get an image The suspense is what makes you want to read the book every second. The mood is my favorite because she tells how the characters feel. The setting was good because she always told you were she was in the book. <BR> The book was one of the best books that I have ever read before. The book also makes you wonder what's going to happen again. I would suggest this book to anyone that likes to read about this. If this was a real book, I would feel bad for Halley and Scarlett because they have to deal with these kinds of problems.	2002-10-28

I found Megan McCafferty's  novel Sloppy Firsts to be enjoyable to read.  The way she wrote it in diary format worked well because it really explained the main character, Jessica Darling's problems the way a teenage would really write them in a diary. Usually first person books don't thrill me, but Megan actually wrote the first person text well.  It was amazing how she wrote it so it seemed like Jessica was really there. It didn't seem like an author was trying to write a book as a teenager.<BR> In the middle of Jessica's junior year of high school, her best friend, Hope Weaver, moves away from Pineville, New Jersey, leaving Jessica alone.  Jessica's so-called friends at school turn out not to be her friends.  All her mother obsesses over is her older sister, Bethany's wedding, and the only things Jessica thinks she has in common with her father are her track meets.  She feels alone most of the time so she likes to write in her journal.  While she's obsessing to herself that she has no one to go to, the biggest \\"dreg\\" in the school, Marcus Flutie, starts to find his way into her heart.  Jessica starts to do things for him that she wouldn't normally do, like peeing in a cup for his drug test.  Marcus gets sent way and when he returns, he has a totally different personality.<BR> A lot of things happen throughout the summer leading up to her senior year.  Jessica becomes better friends with her older friend, Bridget.  When Bridget goes to California to try to become an actress, Manda spends the whole summer sleeping with Bridget's boyfriend, Burke.  Jessica finds out that her friend Hy, a girl that moved to Pineville from the Bronx, is really lying about who she is.  She isn't a girl who came to live with her aunt while her parents figured their marriage out. Hy really is a high class caste who does drugs and has sex.  <BR> Jessica blew up about the SOS (Summer of Shame as they called Manda's \\"thing\\") in the cafeteria one day and created a cat fight between Manda andBridget.  Marcus and Jessica talked in the middle of the night, especially when Jessica broke her ankle and couldn't run anymore that season.  She finally realizes her father and her have more things in common than just running.  Since Bethany never comes home after her wedding, Jessica's mom finally started spending more time with Jessica.  Time would only tell about Marcus and Jessica and Hope and Jessica.<BR> Megan used good imagery because I could see all the scenes and all the characters in my mind like I was really there.  The plot of the story was good because it focused on the main things about the story and didn't go into much detail about little silly things that didn't matter.  I believe that the moral of Sloppy Firsts is one day every thing can be bad, and the next day it could turn around.  You never know what is going to happen.  Don't judge someone and think you know everything about them because there is usually another side to that person that you might not think they had.<BR> This was a really good book and should be on anyone's reading list if they enjoy cute, funny novels about teens.  Megan McCafferty did an amazing job writing this book, and I can't wait to read another book by her.  Sloppy Firsts went into great detail about Jessica's problems.  What was most interesting about it was that it didn't end like I thought it was going to end. When I read most books, I can usually predict the ending by thirty pages into it, but this book I thought I knew the ending and I wasn't even close.  I can't wait for the sequel!	2002-10-28

I think Ruth Pennebaker, the author of Don't Think Twice, did a good job portraying a pregnant teenager's experience. She even enphasized how people reacted to something like that from back in the sixties, which is when the story took place. It was a great book. <BR> Anne is a seventeen-year-old teenager who pregnant after meeting who she was the love of her life.      Her family couldn't bare the embarrassment of having a young pregnant daughter so they sent her away to an unwed mother's home. The setting of the book mostly took place in Texas at the home Anne was sent to. She spent most of her pregnancy there till the time she gave birth. Her life changed a lot at the home. Her horomones were raging and she had a different out look on everything. She really had time to evaluate herself and the people around her. Anne spent most of her time around the girls in the home. She learns about their experiences. While reading the book you see Anne and the girls learn what it's like to be out casts. They have to wear fake wedding rings to pose as married women and have people stare at them as if they were aliens, because they have to travel in a group. Throughout the book Annehas to make the decision of whether or not to give up her baby for adoption. If you think about it, giving up something that spent nine months in you is hard, so the ending is definitely something to look foward to.<BR> In the book Anne lashes out on people when she's in her moods. It's one of those stories where you laugh out loud when she pokes fun at her airhead sister, but you want to cry when one of the girls tells her story about how she was raped. It is a book filled with many emotions and it has a good moral as well. I would recommend it to everyone.	2002-10-28

Ithink that the novel has a good plot and the author uses literary elements.The basic plot had an ace fighter pilot Hawk Hunter, who was fighting to keep the spirit of his country alive.After hearing a report of Russian SAMs deep in the Bad Lands,Hunter would have to stop the Russians plan to win the war. Hunter goes on solo missions to find and destroy the Russian SAMs. Once hes in to deep to call for backup, Hawk finds himself waging a one man war.Teh setting of this book is the ruins of America  and the Bad Lands from North Dakota to Texas. The main character is Hawk Hunter who is a fighter pilot fighting whats left of the war. Some of the key literary elements of the novel are imagery and suspense. There are many examples of these two elements. Two of them are found on pages 145 and 107. These elements helped make the book interesting and helped make the basic ides clear. I would basically keep the novel the way it is. The only change I would make is to put more personification into the book. this in my favor would give the book more suspense and imagery.	2002-10-27

This fourth and final book in the series, The Bridge in the Clouds, is set in the mysterious Golden Valley, where the three Constant children, William, Mary, and, Alice spend their holidays.<BR> From the moment the Constant children arrive at the Golden House, where their Uncle Jack, his fiance Phoebe, and their friend Meg live, they know something is not right. The children's friend, teacher, and the past owner of their Uncle's house, Stephen Tyler also known as the Magician, has not come to visit them since the beginning of their holiday. The children fear he is growing old and is too weak to time travel from his home in the 1930s, as he has done on previous holidays. Even the valley, which is usually bursting with life, seems to be peculiarly quiet. When the children finally get the chance to ask Spot, their Uncle's dog, what is going on he tells them the humans are fighting.<BR> So, the children take matters into their own hands by trying to travel back to the Magician's time, to ask what is happening. The suspense increases when a terrible mistake occurs in the process and they bring part of the Magician's evil assistant and the antagonist, Morden into their time. <BR>Throughout the book you can feel the tension and relief, which is almost the constant mood as slowly the children solve their problems. In this book the reader will witness the joy of the children's journey to finally begin to understand magic. The three characters are all people we can easily relate to and that, in the end, seem like one of our own friends.<BR> This is an excellent book that I think everyone will enjoy reading. It may be confusing to new readers of The Magician's House Quartet, but if you have read the first three books in the series I'm sure you'll enjoy this final book.	2002-10-27

The great story line continues from the part of the trilogy, Silence of the Lambs.  Hannibal is the prelude to Red Dragon.<BR> One of the two main characters is the highly intelligent physician Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  Always telling the truth and a strong interest in fine arts.  Dr. Lecter has one large draw back, he's a cannibal.  Cannibals are people who thrive on human tissue and organs.  He prefers to consume the weak and the corrupted.  By doing so he had gotten himself involved with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a bad note.<BR> Clarice Starling is the other main character.  An FBI agent with lots of ambition and a hard worker.  She was assigned to interview the infamous Dr. Lecter.  Over the many interviews with him during his stay at the asylum he told Clarice the deepest things about herself.  For that she respected him.  The respect between the two of them was mutual.  Clarice lives with her African American friend Ardelia Mapp.<BR> The great novel opens to Calrice Starling arriving at the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Fire Arms to begin a SWAT raid.  The purpose of the engagement was apprehending the drug and firearm smuggler Evelda Drumgo, who was connected to the Trey- Eigth Crips.  The raid went sour when Starling ended up saving her own life and the squads.  To do so she had to shoot the Drumgo carrying a baby in her arms.  It may have seemed cruel and outrageous, but Evelda had possession of an automatic weapon.<BR> After the unsuccessful raid Starling is sent on a leave with pay from the Bureau.  The copperplate written letters begin to appear more recently for Clarice.  She notifies the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is reassigned to the physicians most wanted case.<BR> The soul survivor of Dr. Hannibal Lecter's cannibal phetish is a crippled inheritance of a wealthy father.  Mr. Mason Verger had hired his own bounty hunters to track down his attacker.  Mason's plan was to capture and film the torture and soon after death of his former physiatrist.  The chase continues through Europe and the United States.  Various problems occur in the Bureau and for the bounty hunters hired to capture Lecter.<BR> Thomas Harris uses a wide array of literary elements in Hannibal.  He uses characterization to creat each and every one in the book.  Each one is expand through the course of the novel.  The figurative speech, imagery, metaphors, and similes are outstandingly ingenious.  At some sections in the story the imagery was horrifying and to some extent sickening.  Since Dr. Lecter is so intelligent, figurative speech, complicated similes, and metaphors are stunningly strung through the story like sprinkles on a cupcake.  The sensory language much like the imagery is often stomach churning.  It's like that of Marilyn Manson's controversial music videos.  The whole story line with its extraordinary level of suspense.  It makes the whole novel one enormous, never falling climax.<BR> I enjoyed Hannibal immensely.  It appealed to all of my senses and pulled me in.  I read this masterpiece in three days.  I recommend this to anyone who has a lust for interesting and somewhat disturbing sense of literature.  If you loved the movie then this book is for you.  The details are ten times more explosive in the book.  They are superior to that I have ever seen or watched.  Read the book and you'll get the parts the movie didn't have.	2002-10-26

To find you have to read the book!<BR>      I would recommend this book to good readers, but if your a slow reader this is not the book for you. The books about 300 pages and is pretty hard to understand sometimes. Overall it's a good book and would be enjoyed by many people.	2002-10-26

The author, J.R. Toilken, takes the reader on a fantasy and great adventure. It is filled with great action and battle.<br /> The whole story takes place in Middle Earth. It all starts one day when thirteen dwarves greeted a hobbit, which was a human like creature of Middle Earth, and a mysterious old man named Gandalf. They take Bilbo Baggins on a quest to the Lonely Mountain, were the dwarves are trying to get their treasure back from the dragon Smaug.

On the way they get into some difficult situations, fighting off goblins, maugs and giant spiders, thanks to the help of Eldron, Beorn, and The Eagle King, they get threw their predicament ha and make to Smaug's dark lair.<br /> The author uses good literary elements like imagery when he described the Goblin King. Quote from the book \\"There in the shadows, on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head.\\" He also did this when describing the elf home Rivendelle. The author also used good iron when the characters where in their many problems. An example was when the maugs, which were evil wolves, were chasing Bilbo from tree to tree and he could not get up.<br /> I would definatly recommend this book to a person who likes great adventures and some sorcery. I also think this book is one good for all ages of people, because it has stuff for the young as well for the old. This book is on my top five lists.	2002-10-25

Two Towers is the second book of the Lord of the Ring series.  The plot of the novel revolves around destroying the ring of evil power.<BR> <BR> The novel beginning with an interesting \\"cat and mouse\\" game. The characters are from all over middle earth.  Some of the characters are Froto, Gimly, Arawhen, elf and dwarf. The character are trying to destroy the ring. They had to destroy the so the evil would not come back.<br /> In the book Gimmle comes later. Gimmle helps them get to somewhere they need to go. He is helping them because he was tortured because he had the for along time. When they found out he had it they found him and tortured him. On the way back they blindfolded him so he would not know the way back.  <br /> In the book they had a lot of imagery. When I read some parts of the book it felt like I was in the book. He used a lot of description. The symbol of the book was the ring itself. The ring symbols the book because the book is based on destroying the ring. The theme of the book is about the Hobbits. Hobbits even though small have as much to offer as humans, elfs and dwarfs.<br /> I would recommend Two Towers  to anyone who likes to read to fantasy and adventure books. Tolkein used many details to describe the characters and settings with in the novel. The sere Lord of the Ring  is an exciting, suspenseful and action packed book. I cant wait to read the next book in the series.	2002-10-25

Up and coming basketball players are always being mobbed by reporters and newswriters.  They never get a break.  The plot of this story revolves around a person named Sonny Youngblood who attends Southern Illinois University(SIU.)  It discusses the trials and tribulations of trying to be a basketball star throughout the book.<BR>Sonny is involved with many characters throughout the book.  Some of these characters are: Uncle Seth, his mother, and his cousin, Sissy.  The setting of this book is Illinois, sometime in modern times.  The entire book is based in Illinois.<BR>About halfway through the book, Sonny finds out that he will not have enough credits to be able to play basketball.  So, he asks his cousin, Sissy, if he can do some art work with her.  It isn't real art work, it's just basically having Sonny move art pieces from an old abandoned building to another newer building.  Sissy can't lift the art herself, so she asks Sonny to help her.  Sonny's team does very well in the tournament.  That describes probably about half the book.<BR>The author used many literary elemnets in this book.  One of those literary elements is irony.  The author used irony by having the book go nice and easy, then all of a sudden, something ironic happens to Sonny.  The author uses foreshadowing very well also.  When Sonny is in the fraternity, he doesn't really like it.  He quits the fraternity.  Towards the end of the book, he meets up with them because he forgot to bring them their ring.  He argues with them because they wanted him to join back.  The setting was not a place that I could relate to.  This is a good read for any basketball fanatic; or any sports fanatic in general.  The ending by itself is worth the reading.	2002-10-25

Her father left ten years ago, and moved from their home in Washington to Michigan, where he married a woman named Ophelia. Katherine's mother, an out-of-work alcoholic, has been in bed for weeks after losing her job, leaving Katherine and her 14 year old brother Douglas, and her younger sisters Tracey (age 13) and Alisa (age 8) to fend for themselves. Things only get worse as Katherine and her siblings try to hide what's going on, afraid that Social Services will separate them and put them in foster homes - the only relative who will take them being their weed-smoking aunt in California. Eventually their teachers begin to get suspicious, the electricity in their house is shut off because their mother didn't pay the bills, and food and money are running out (until Katherine manages to get a hold of her mother's ATM card). Worst of all, something seems to be wrong with Alisa - she becomes obsessed with finding the door to the imaginary land of Narnia, where she believes she will find a cure for her mother. I must admit, this is a wonderful book. The plot is interesting and the imagery used by the author is very realistic. It felt like I was right there with the characters, seeing what they were going through and feeling their emotions. It was one of those books that I just couldn't put down.

I liked the horror, the suspence, and the mystery of the book.  It also had death, crime, lying, love, and also desire.  It was a good story but the climax was a little dull.  I really like all horror, and VAMPIRE books anyway.	2002-10-16

The year is 1960. Bron is a good student, and has always lived life by the rules. It doesn't take long for her to realize if she doesn't change herself, she will not fit in with the carefree, easygoing teens in town. A popular interest of these individuals is drag racing, something that Bron wrongly thought she would never experience herself. Soon she meets J.C., an extremely attractive racer, and Will, a down-to-earth, old-fashioned country guy. She gets caught between them, and some interesting things occur with both men. I guess you could say she has a lot of things on her mind, including her reckless friend Lanie, the legendary horrific fires of Ojala, the profits of her family business, and her life's turn for romance and adventure. Hobbs really brings Bron's story to life through her dense plot and rising action. There is an overwhelming mood this book gives you through Bron's interactions with other characters. I really started to enjoy the book as the number of friendships and relationships Bron aquires increased. The ending really left me thinking because there is a distinct mystery to it. The genre is a combination of coming-of-age, adventure, and romance; no single genre would be fit by itself in my opinion. I really felt like I knew the characters personally as the plot thickened. I would definatly recommend this book to anyone. If an adult were to read it, he or she would have a good idea of the aspects of American teenagers' lives.	2002-10-12

Other charachters were his father Abner, his mother Mavis, his rival friend Kenwood, and there coach Andreson. Billy and his family live in the country on a farm where they grow crops and raise animals. Billy's father ends up going to prison in the begining of the story because he ran over Randy Myers cars with a D-6 Catipillar. Abner really dosnt care how much BIlly gets in to as long as his farm work is all complete Abner will leave Billy alone. Bill is the kind of person who has a lot of confedence in him self an wilol stick up for himself when people like Kenwood make fun of him. BIllys mother is kind of quiet and dose not talk that much. Mavis loves her husband a lot but dosent have any control over Abner or Billy. Her opinins are really not heard by billy or Abner. Kenwood is a spolied little rich kid and lives in the rich area of Flintwood. He also likes to make jokes about Billys father being in prison. Coach Anderson trties to keep billy out of trouble because he has a really good pitching arm and the coach wants Billy on the team.Billy wants to be on the team but his farm work keeps Billy from getting to go to practice. THe literary elements are foreshadowing, sensry languge, plot, similes, irony, and mood. My opinion on the book was that it was excellent. I like the book so much because Billy had a lot of responsibilities to keep up with.	2001-11-07

It was written by Orson Scoot Card. This is the first time I have heard of his writing. In fact I thought it was great. The book a lot of description in it and if you like science fiction you should love this book. My opinion on this book is once you start reading you can't and you don't wont to stop. Each thing that happened is tied into another.<br />         In this book Children of the Mind there were basically two teams or partners in this book. There was Miro and Young Val. Then Peter and Wang-mu. Peter is a creation of Ender but this isn't any kind if creation. Peter is a body but has no true soul he is really Ender. Peter and Wang-mu's job is to find information on people, plant's, and Jane.<br />        Miro and Young Val have Basically the same situation. Miro was given a body from Ender. While Young Val has the same thing as Peter She is only made up. In realty she is there but in souls she isn't even born. These two have to search for new plants for the species.<br />         So the reason they have to do these job's is because Starways Congress wants to blow up the planet Lusitania because it is threatened to have a virus. Jane, an evolved super computer, can help them save the planet but she will be shut down at any moment. The big problem is three species will die: the pequienios or trees, humans, and hive queens, which are like ants. While Jane is alive she can move ships faster than light. The question is: Will Jane live and be able to transport all the species? Can they save Jane before the planet is blown up?<br />              The Literary Elements were foreshadowing, drama, and sensory language. It even has some conflict. Well I recommend this book to any person who likes science fiction and who wants to read about what dilemmas people will have in the year 3000.	2001-11-02

I think one of the main reasons why I liked it so much is because I am and dancer myself. That's not the only reason I thought it was so good though. It was also the author wrote the book and how it was about a girl who felt like an outcast and what it was like to do something different from everyone else and be completely different from most people.<BR> The book Dancer is about the main character Stephanie Haynes. Stephanie takes ballet classes everyday of the week. She takes it very seriously. She's also very good at it. Stephanie basically devotes her life to ballet. This book takes place in a small rich town called Cherry Hill in Colorado, in present times. The reason I know it was present times is because Stephanie and her friends do most of the same pastimes as teenagers now a days do.<BR> Stephanie goes to a private school on a scholarship. Her father is a janitor at the school. She doesn't have very many friends at school only one girl who she knows from dance class. She's sort of an outcast because she's really quiet and doesn't hang out with anyone at school and when she's not at school she's at ballet class. Stephanie likes ballet because it gives her something special that she does different from anyone and she's good at it too. Also at Stephanie's school there is the popular girls: Gillian, Lisa and Kelly. Gillian used to be like Stephanie. Her and Stephanie are probably the only black girls in the school but when Gillian moved there she hung out with the popular girls and ignores Stephanie. Stephanie kind of feels embarrassed when she's around the popular girls.<BR> Then one day she meets him, Vance. He starts taking classes at the dance academy. At first Stephanie doesn't really like him but when she gets to know him things sort of spark up. She starts hanging out with Vance more often. She also meets his Aunt Winnie. His AuntWinnie used to be a dancer in Germany. Her dream was to be in the NYC ballet but at that time blacks weren't allowed to dance in NYC. Stephanie starts taking classes with Ms. Winnie on Sundays. Vance usually joins them. Ms. Winnie starts creating a dance between Vance and Stephanie. Ms. Winnie is sort of Stephanie's role model and inspiration.<BR> Stephanie and Vance start spending more time together and Stephanie gets aggravated because Vance won't open up to her and she's nearly in tears because of her parents. That's another thing Stephanie's parents don't understand how important dance is to her and her dad keeps pushing her to look at colleges and she gets in a lot of arguments with her parents.<BR> One day Stephanie is at school and she goes into the bathroom and hears some one coughing under the stall. She peeks under and sees that it's one of the popular girls. It turns out that she took a lot of her mom's pills the night before and was really sick. Stephanie helps her get help and get to a hospital.<BR> Then Stephanie finds out that Vance wants to quit ballet because he really likes club dancing, but he doesn't know how to tell Ms. Winnie and he wants to drop out of the summer recital. But he can't because he's the prince in Sleeping Beauty and he's the only boy for the part so Stephanie convinces him to wait until the end of the recital to talk to Ms. Winnie. <BR> I liked this book a lot and I would recommend it to teen girls who enjoy reading about the ways of a girls like and what some girls go through. I also liked how you could relate to Stephanie's problems. They weren't like un- real problems. I also like the ending it was a real shocker. Read this book and find out if Stephanie gets to live her dream of becoming a dancer in the American Ballet Company!	2001-11-02

The story revolves around Jake Brigance, a lawyer who's defending an African-American named Mr. Carl Lee Hailey Jr. He openly shoots two caucasian boys as they were on trial for raping Mr. Hailey's daughter.  Now, Mr. Hailey is on trial for the murder of the two boys and Jake Brigance is facing off with Rufus Buckley, the District D.A for the twenty-second judicial district.  With the trial nearing, death threats and burning crosses have become a regular accurance with the Ku Klux Klan back in Ford County.  An informant, known only as Mickey Mouse, keeps the cops notified of  where the klan will strike next.  John Grisham used multiple literary elements.  For example, the burning crossed set by the KKK at Jake Brigance and the potential jurors houses were symbols of the Ku Klux Klan &quot;politely suggesting&quot; that they do not vote not-guilty for Carl Lee Hailey Jr's murder trial.  A Time to Kill was flooding with suspense!  Everytime I put down my book my mind would be on nothing except the story.  I would be up until eleven, twelve O'Clock at night because I couldn't put down the book, and the only way to stop reading would be to fall asleep in teh process with the book still draped in my fingers.  A main theme, or central message, was that of racism.  Throughout the book it was argued inbetween  characters that if Carl Lee Hailey Jr. was white he would not be on trial.  I have an interesting theory on the element of tone.  I am an avid watcher of Law and Order.  On the television show the District Attorney (or DA) is portraid as the protagonist.  Through a diference of obvious artistic opinion, the DA in A Time to Kill is portrayed as the antagonist.  A highly hated man who is just after publicity and a seat as governor.  The General mood of A Time to Kill is gloomy.  The main settings that cast a gloom glow are the jail, victims of the KKK, and Jake Brigance bustiling run-down office.  Mr. Grisham works exceptionally well with suspense, and being a past-lawyer himself, writes excellent courtroom dramsas that keep you yearning for more.  I also enjoyed The Client, which is my favorite book and Runaway Jury, both by John Grisham.  I am a big fan of John Grisham, and I find A Time to Kill to be one of his best.  I recommend it most highly, and personally you'd be a fool if you let this novel pass you by.	2001-10-31

The book I read was a novel by Davida Wills Hurwin call A Time For Dancing.<BR>  This book was about two 16 year old girls named Julie and Samantha, who have been best friends forever.  Samantha would call Julie her \\"One and Only\\" because they were always there for each other and could tell each other anything.  Samantha and Julie had one thing in common that brought them very close together.  This was the fact that they both were very talanted dancers, and belonged to an academy along with other members.  Samantha and Jules were very passionate about their future dance careers that thy were hoping to achieve.<BR> The climax of A Time For Dancing came while Samantha and Julie were at their dance rehearsals.  Julie hadn't been feeling that great but she just ignored it thinking it was just a cold.  That day at rehearsal, Julie was overcome by tremendous pain and could barely move.  This was when Julie's parents and Sam knew that something had to be done.  They took Jules to every single doctor aroung where they lived, and all they told her was that it was nothing serious even though the pain just kept getting worse and not better.  Finally Julie's parents brought her to a specialist in San Francisco.  Dr. Conner took a bone marrow sample and discovered that Jules had a type of cancer called diffuse histiocytic lymphoma, and it had already hit Stage Four.  This was the beginning of Julie's long journey of trying to fight off the cancer by getting chemotherapy.  No matter what happened, though, Samantha made it known to Julie that she would always be her \\"One and Only.\\"  <BR> The author of A Time For Dancing did a very good job of using literary elements to set the mood of the story.

It wasn't that the story was just so good, but more the way each chapter was written.  The author went back and forth from character to character, giving you hints that the two would meet(foreshadowing,) but not knowing what they would do together.  The answer won't come until the last chapter, too.  You just have to keep reading. Each chapter will strike you differently.  Some will leave you grief strucken and feeling remorse for the characters, while others leave you angry and wanting revenge.  <BR>       Tenderness is a great book for teenagers, and young adults.  I really enjoyed reading it.	2001-10-31

It lets you in on the journey of someone who is moving slowly towards the world of madness.<br />          Lisa Shilling is experiencing mental problems of which seem to put her as an outcast at school.  Some of her closest friends, Mary Nell, Betsy and Elizabeth realize that there is a problem.  They seek to find answers in their own &quot;group therapy&quot; everyday after school.  Although the students see that Lisa has a problem, Lisa's parents deny the facts that are given to them.<br />          Through out the book Lisa makes situations worse just to try to prove it to her parents that she needs help.  Many of the other adults know what's going on because of the involvement of their kids, but find it best to stay out of it.  Lisa's parents finally give in to the problem after Lisa hurts herself another time.  They agree to seek help and things start to turn around for the better.<br />      The author did a good job showing that sometimes parents don't want to understand but if you push hard enough they will give in.  Great details get you involved with the realistic situation and can allow you to think about these issues.  This is  a wonderful book if you want to experience  new uncommon issues.	2001-10-31

The Hobbit is a fantasy that takes place in Middle Earth.  Middle Earth is filled with dragons, knights, castles and grand battles. Grassy valleys, dark forests, grey mountains and blue rivers is what Middle Earth looks like.<br />  The story starts off in Bilbo Baggins hobbit hole. Bilbo, like any other hobbit never leaves his hobbit hole and eats five meals a day. A hobbit is a furry fellow who is slightly smaller than a dwarf. They don&#8217;t wear shoes because they have leather feet.<br />  Hobbits never go on adventures. That is, until one morning when Bilbo&#8217;s house is filled with thirteen dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. The hobbit is asked by the wizard to join them on their journey. After a debate, Bilbo decides to go help the dwarves recover their gold from the Dragon, Smaug.<br />  Bilbo didn&#8217;t know how to take care of himself without being in his hobbit hole. Sometimes they didn&#8217;t eat at all and Bilbo was used to eating five meals a day. During his adventure Bilbo fell into goblin caves, was caught by wood elves, attacked by killer spiders and was in the Great War with the Goblins. (spoiler)<br />  The main characters are Bilbo the hobbit, Gandalf the wizard, Thorin the dwarf king and Smaug the dragon. My favorite character was Gandalf because he used magic. He used magic for fun to entertain by making fireworks and also as a weapon of mass destruction to kill his enemies. I liked the use of imagery in the book. The words used to describe the mountains, forests and dungeons made you feel as if you were there. The plot was exciting, action packed and suspenseful.<br />  I really enjoyed The Hobbit and would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or books with medieval settings. Will Bilbo and the dwarves kill the Dragon Smaug and recover the lost gold, or will Smaug kill them ? Will good triumph over evil? Read it and find out!	2001-10-31

This is an exciting story about friendship, hardships, love, and hate.<BR>  The main character, Halley, tells the story of her life for about a one-year period. They live in a small town with many neighbors. Her best friend, since she was five, lives right across the street. Her name is Scarlet, and she is a very active and daring girl. <BR> Halley is now a junior at her school, and has to deal with so many new things. A new boyfriend who is kind of mysterious, a mother who's trust is gone, her grandmother is old and dying, and to top it all off Scarlet has something very unexpected happen to her that can change her life forever.<BR> I liked the way that the author used sensory language to make your senses come alive. For example, Halley worked in a grocery store. When the author explained a fruit, she used such great detail that you could almost taste it. It was like you were sitting right there, watching everything that was happening. She also gave clues or foreshadowed as to what was going to happen in the future. The author wrote things at the end of each chapter... &quot;Little did I know that the worst was yet to come.&quot; This way you could kind of guess what was going to happen next. Everything about this book just made you get caught up reading it.<BR> This book was so good, I had a hard time putting it down. I was up until eleven o'clock at night, I just couldn't stop reading. I guarantee that anyone who reads this book won't want to put it down.<BR> Other books by Sarah Dessen are That Summer, and Keeping the Moon. I have yet to read them, but I can't wait until I do!	2001-10-31

They go to Bayport high school.  The story takes place in the 50's I would say by the way the boys dress and the way the author explains the story.<br />  The story starts out when the boys find out that their friends car ''the queen''has been stolen.  The story turns into a much bigger mystery when they find out that the thief has robbed the Tower Mansion.  Can the boys find the thiefor will he roam free?<br />  I thought this book was very good.

It's based around the lives of three youg teens. Starting out with the words &quot;Hey Homo,&quot; it captured my attention right away. Pook is the homosexual who is out of the closet. Wyatt is very overweight and Dante is a Rastifarian with a serious heart condition. These boys are best friends who want more than anything to get out of Babylon, their dangerous ghetto. Throughout the story they encounter many problems including: dealing drugs, fights, gang problems, tagging bathrooms and running from Air Touch. (A big gangster/bully)<BR> A quote that particularly stuck in my mind was: &quot;We all just little black ants in Babylon, waitin' to get stepped on and too stupid to see it.&quot; It's kind of true because these boys know that they will never be good enough with society looking down on them all the time.<BR> I guess the whole reason I liked the book was, even though the characters may come off rough edged or as black trouble makers they are not. If other people took the time, they would find a bunch of passionate young men.<BR> I would recommend this book to all mature audiances because the content may not be appropiate for children.	2001-10-30

If you are looking for a book with a lot of excitement and adventure this would be the book to read.<br />  This book follows up where J.R.R. Tolkien's first book, the Hobbit, leaves off. It is the first book of a three book series.<br />  The book takes place in an imaginary world called middle earth. Middle earth has all types of strange creatures in it including hobbits. Hobbits are little people that are cheerful and shy. The main character in this book is a hobbit named Frodo who must go on a perilous adventure. This book also contained a lot of sensory language. The Fellowship of the Ring also had many surprise outcomes or endings. If you try to guess what will happen next you are usually wrong.<br />  If you are interested in reading this book I sugest first reading The Hobbit, which contains an equally exciting adventure and will help explain many parts of The Fellowship of the Ring.<br />  Another interesting thing is that there is a movie coming out of The Fellowship of the Ring and this may be another incentive for reading it.	2001-10-30

It is a book about a terrible virus that is spread by using needles, and it must be stopped now or it will never be stopped.<BR>   It all began with a plane accident where people needed  blood.  Other people donated it to the people that needed it and one person got this terrible and horrifing virus called HIV-4.  It is like HIV but a lot worse, and there's no cure for it.  A doctor named, Clayton Husch is with this clan or gang thattook the blood and they go around injecting it in to people so that they will pass it on to other people.<BR>   A detective named William Grant in Brisbane during a hot humid summer, is trying to find out who is doing this terrifying thing to young and old people in this town.  The Brisbane police and this detective do everything to try to stop it but it just keeps getting worse.  If they don't stop it soon the whole country will get it and soon, the WHOLE WORLD!!!<BR>   The author used great sensory language in this book, so that the reader could really imagine what is going on and almost feel the things he talks about.  An example would be, when the bad HIV-4 people went to a party with 8 highschool students on a beach, they made the kids &quot;lay down on the soft damp sand with it smushing in their faces.&quot;  While the bad guys injected them with HIV-4.  Also when he said that the needle was like a long stinger on a bee and it felt a lot worse than a bee sting.  It felt like a horn of a rhino stabbing you.<BR>   I think that it is a great book, I would read it again and I would encourage a lot of people who like mysteries,action and suspense in a book to read it.  If so than this is a book for you.<BR>   I would have to say that this is the best book I have read, since &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;  It is a good book from the beging to the end.  It has made me want to read mor of Peter Caines books, and I will.	2001-10-29

When they hijack the bus, they immediately tell the bus driver to keep driving.  After fifteen minutes they give her directions to an abandoned bridge.  While this is going on,  Miro has pulled out a bag of candy for the kids on the bus.  The kids don't know the candy is drugged with tranquilizers.  Once they reach the bridge, Artkin and Miro put tape all over the bus windows except for small slits so they can see outside<BR>    Somehow one of the kids dies, probably because he had a weak heart.  Before all this, Artkin had sent a letter to the secret agency Inner Delta.  Their plan is to destroy Inner Delta because it has been kept a secret for so long.  Overall I think this book is very well written,  and has a lot of action throughout the book.  I also enjoyed how there was a lot of suspense as well.  I was at the edge of my seat  reading more and more.  I was also surprised by many of the events that took place unexpectedly,  and many of these events kept on changing.<BR>    Robert Cormier did an excellent job in putting so much detail in his characters.

I chose this book because my teacher used it as an example for our project, and I thought it looked like something I would enjoy.  It reminded me of the movie American History X, and since I like that movie, I thought I would like this book.  The story is realistic fiction.  The author uses this genre because she wants to get a specific point across about anti-Semitism.  It would have been difficult to discuss the same theme using a different genre.<BR>There are three main characters in this novel, and several secondary characters that are also important to the story.  Zack is the main character.  He's an athletic, popular sophomore in high school.  He's friends with everybody, and has no real problems.  Rachel is another main character.  She is the best looking girl in high school, and is Zack's girlfriend.  Pam, a secondary character, is Zack's ex-girlfriend.  They were forced to break up by their parents because she's Christian and Zack is Jewish.  Mrs. Levy is also a main character.  She is Rachel's mother.  Her character is important to the story because she is a concentration camp survivor.  Zack's father is a secondary character, but is important to the story because he is an attorney.<BR>The book takes place in modern day America in Boston, Massachusetts.  Zack's father is the Essex County District Attorney.  I think the author chose a realistic setting because the events of the story could have actually happened.  The book spans a few weeks throughout a high school lacrosse season.  The author refers to Zack's games all through the story.<BR>The story begins by describing Zack's life as a being pretty regular.  His father prosecutes a lot of high profile cases, and tends to bring his work home with him.  He tells Zack that his latest case is about anti-Semitic graffiti that was spray painted on the side of a Jewish Temple.  The graffiti contained the names of seven concentration camps from the Holocaust in World War II.  At first, Zack didn't realize the seriousness of the crime, but throughout the story it became clearer to him.  By speaking to his father, Mr. and Mrs. Levy, and making the connections as to why he had to break up with his first girlfriend, he started to understand the hate crime.  What he realized throughout the book that anti-Semitism hurts everyone, not just Jews.<BR>The theme of The Hate Crime is that crimes that attack a person's race or religion need to be addressed in today's society.  The author uses the characters and their backgrounds to get her theme across.  Zack is Jewish, but is unaware of the history of the Holocaust until someone paints racial slurs on a Boston Jewish temple.  The main character's girlfriend is the daughter of Holocaust survivors.  This is how the author includes historical facts into the story.  Phyllis Karas also uses conflict and resolution to get her message of how anti-Semitic acts hurt everyone.  It is Zack's teammate that is directly involved in the hate crimes.  The author places the setting in the present to allow the reader to know that hate crimes are not a problem of the past.  <BR>I would rate this book as being fair.  The book is called The Hate Crime, and all it talked about up until the seventh chapter was Zack and his girlfriend.  It didn't seem to relate to the topic.  It also talked a lot about lacrosse, and I think a lot of these parts could have been left out.  I liked the fact that it help me learn more about the Holocaust, and what happened to people in concentration camps.

US	42480219	R2UDPG4KI34IVK	014131088X	618877188	Speak	Books	5	0	1	N	N	review	In Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson, a troubled girl named Melinda Sordino had been living her freshman year at Syracuse High School with her tongue emotionally tied in knots.  Melinda forces herself to keep a huge secret from every soul while staying away from her biggest fear- Andy Evans.  Melinda got off to a bad start at school by calling the police on a senior end-of-summer party because of a horrible attack by Andy.<BR> She began the year with one friend, Heather, who she was with often.  But soon enough, Heather left Melinda to try and join the \\"popular\\" clique.  With no friends left, she is abandoned as an outcast with no place to go for safety.  She has very little communication with her parents as well as with the world around her.  The one hope for that communication with her family is leaving sticky notes on the kitchen table.  The only thing that interests her seems to be working in art class where she gets help expressing herself from the teacher, Mr. Freeman.<BR> The author makes you not only watch the life of Melinda spin in circles but really feel the agony that she is going through on the inside.  I personally enjoyed reading the story. Page after page, I wondered what would happen next.  There was a very good use of foreshadowing which led up to the moment Melinda would speak and confront her fears.  Anyone who has a sensitive soul will have a place in their heart for Melinda after looking into her life through this book. I would recommend this for people ages 13 and up.	2001-10-27

This book takes place in the late 1990's in a rual area. This book is about friendships and emotional problems.<BR>   The main Character and narrator,Melinda,is a bit shy and untrusting of people. No one really anymore due to a trumatic event that occured during the summer. Another important charater was heather. Heather was alittle geeky, but very out-going and wanted everyone to like her.Heather and Melinda became friends when no one would even acknowledge them.<BR>    The author used a lot of forshadowing to tell about some of the events that took place during the summer.Like when one of melinda's ex-friends asked hre why she had called the cops.<BR>     I really liked this book. It really made me think about friend and who was a actual true friend to me.Infact melinda acted somewhat how I do, so I could really relate to this story.This book is a definate read!	2001-10-27

It just kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I personally don't enjoy reading a lot but this book actually made me want to read longer and longer.<BR>     The book is about a little girl called Lyra who is about twelve years old.  She lives at a collage called Jorden Collage with a lot of scholes.  Then one night at the collage Lyra overheard a statement that would change her life forever.  The talk was about an extradinary element, microscopic in size.  Lyra heard that this partical called dust could unite whole universes, but it was only found in the vast parts of the northern artic.  But some people were scared of dust and wanted to detroy it.<BR>     Lyra realised her destiny was to find the dust.  When the Lord of the collage was arrested, he gave a golden compass to Lyra that was called a antiemeter.  This compass possessed the power to answer any question that you asked it.  It does this by pointing to three different pictures or symbols with three different hands.  Only a few people knew how to read the compass so Lyra struggled to teach herself how to understand it.  When Lyra set off for the north she was helped by Gyptions, which were people, Withes and giant armored bears, which were polar bears with special armor and great strength.  Lyra was forced to fight many battles against an evil person called Ms. Coutler, who wants to take all of the dust for herself and use it to create a new universe.<BR>     The author also used some literary terms such as foreshadowing.  He used this element when he said,&quot;Isoric will become king of the bears again.&quot; That was foreshadowing because Isoric did become king of the armored bears later on when he killed the new king to gain the thrown. <BR>     The whole time Lyra hadn't the faintest clue that she alone was destined to win or lose a battle that would change the universe forever.<BR>     My personal opinion of this book is that it was an excellent book and that it was very exiting.  I gave it two thumbs up.  If you are looking for a great science fiction book, this is the one to read.  I would have to say it is one of my favorite books ever.	2001-10-26

Only to find out that he has a broadcasting job for his college radio station. Reve has been talking about what happened to Janie as a child; and he thinks that she won't find out. <BR>   Firstly The book was pretty boaring. I didn't like the way that the author kept skipping back and fourth from janie to Reve. I personally thought that Reve's parts were more interesting than Janie's because he was the one talking to people on the radio and living at college. Janie would talk about the future or to her friends wich were boaring. <BR>    &quot;The Voice on the Radio&quot; is a sequel to &quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot;. In my opinion the first book was better. It was more exciting. So I would have to say that I realy Didn't like &quot;The Voice on the Radio&quot;.	2001-10-25

This book was about the best sniper in the marines,  Gunnery Sargent Carlos Norman Hathcock II.<BR>The book opens with Carlos N. Hathcock. The character is about eight yaers old and lives in Geyer Springs, Arkansas. For his tenth birthday Carlos recieved a  J.C. Higgens .22 calabor single-shot rifle, Carlos never missed a shot. As a boy Carlos Hathcock was a skinny, black haired boy who no longer wore jeans and t-shirts but Marine Corps herringbone and boodocoker boots. At the age of twelve Carlos got a brand new Remington 12-gauge single-shot shotgun. Carlos was not a real good shot with a shotgun; he was a better shot with his .22. Carlos Hathcock had a good personality. He was always willing to help people; even though he had a temper his other qualities made up for that.<BR>On a warm spring day in 1959 Carlos Norman Hathcock stood in the Marine Corp's recruiter's office on May 20, the day of his 17th birthday.  Carlos was fufilling an old dream.  Carlos went to bootcamp in  San Diego, California. After bootcamp Carlos Hathcock was stationed in Hawaii. During Carlos's time in Hawaii he was put through the Sniper Scout School there. After a while of cruising exotic ports of the Far East and South Pacific, the Marines sent Carlos to Cherry Point, North Carolina. <BR>When Carlos Hjathcock was at Cherry Point, North Carolina  he met  a girl, Josephine Bryan, and after three months of dating Carlos married Josephine.<BR>Carlos Hathcock did not tell his wife what he did for the Marine Corps until one morning when Jo picked up the newspaper and read the article: <BR>  A Scout-Sniper with the 1st Marine Divison in Vietnam earned prasie from his commanding officer for \\"making life miserable for the Vietcong.\\" Sgt. Carlos Norman Hathcock of New Bern is one of several \\"expert marksman\\" credited with killing more than 65 enemies. Firing at ranges up to 1,125 yards, Hathcock and the \\"crew\\" have been picking off better than two enemies a day- without a friendly casualty (23).<br />  Carlos Hathcock went on four tours of Vietnam. After his time in Vietnam, Carlos had a final total of 93 comfirmed kills. After Vietnam, Carlos became a rifle range instructor and is still in the Marines.<BR>Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Norman Hathcock II, United States Marines Corps (ret.), was laid to rest Friday, February 26, at Woodlawn Memorial Gardens in Norfolk, Virginia.  Gunnery Sgt. Hathcock was 56 years old.<BR>   Some literary elements the author used are metaphor, foreshadowing, and vivid language.  When you read this book you can get the pictures in your mind of what the author is describing. An example of metaphor would be when \\" Lets see if I can rain on his parade.\\" An example of foreshadowing would be Hathcock moved his scope's cross hairs onto the front of the boy's bike. He pressed his thumb slowly down on the trigger and sent a heavy ( two and -one-half inch, seven hundred-grain) bullet ripping into the bicycle's frame work. This hinted that the boy was going to die. <br />  In conclusion, I liked this book a lot.  If you are thinking about a military career you should read this book.   You can learn a lot about about Marine Corp Sniper's life.	2001-10-25

It has an incredibly facinating plot, with impecable details.  Together these two characteristics create a captivating novel that reaches into the mind of the reader.<BR>    Nancy Springer's use of imagery brings the reader into the mystical Arthurian world of the sorceress, herself, Morgan le Fay.  The castles, forests, events, and never-ending emotions are portrayed so well in the story that the reader can clearly picture them in his/her mind.  The author also brings you, the reader, into the mind of the spoiled, stubborn Morgan, as she grows both older and wiser.  As you read through the book, you feel everything that Morgan feels, and begin to think the way <BR>she does, often forgetting about reality and falling into the words of the novel.<BR>   As Morgan grows by learning and gaining powers from the milprieve stone, she begins to understand more about herself, and how her past has formed the person she is now.<BR>   Overall, I felt the novel, I am Morgan le Fay, was a fantastic book filled with dazzling events, people, and places that tease the mind for more reading.  I would most definitely recommend this book to readers with creative minds, good imaginations, and those who enjoy fantasy.	2001-10-25

It's a thrilling adventure saga of a husky pup alone against the northern wilderness in the early 1900's.<br />        The steel-gray husky, Chiri, was just a pup when the he witnessed black wolf killed his mother and brother.  Alone in the great northern wilderness, he learned to survive by instinct and native intelligence, hunting small game for himself and keeping warm in the den his mother built for him.  He lived life seeking revenge, knowing he would one day cross paths again with his vicious enemy and only one would survive.  Trapper, Link Stevens, is the only human Chiri will learn to trust. The plot takes the reader from the time Chiri is left orphaned in the great wilderness, to when he unites with Link Stevens and saves his life.<br /> In my opinion, this adventure saga was a great book.  The details the author uses to describe what is happening is amazing.  The description of the bitterness and the harshness of the great northern wilderness made you feel like you were there.  The tone of this book is very straight forward.  It is told in third person. I would recommend this book to anyone.	2001-10-24

It kept me reading so then I could see what was going to happen next. The book was about a young man, Francis Cassevant, who went to war and jumped on a grenade and blew his face up.  People stare at him in horror in the streets in the town of Frenchtown.  He meets a girl and they become good friends and likes her deeply but, she just likes him as a friend.  He becomes a champion at table tennis and beats his old friend for the championship.  He also wants to kill his old hero, but you will have to read the book to see what happens and see if he kills his old hero or if he gets killed.	2001-10-18
