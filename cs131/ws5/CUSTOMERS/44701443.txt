If a man will cheat on his fiancee, nevermind his feelings for another, how can she ever fully trust him not to do it to her. What if he falls in love with someone else down the line. That is classic! <br />No matter how selfish and spoiled Darcy may have been, neither of them should have carried on the affair. Dex *was* spineless in that he waited until the last moment to break it off with Darcy. If he was so in love with Rachel, he should have done it immediately. Rachel was the backup. <br />I am still interested in the sequel to this story, but the author has her work cut out for her redeeming the Darcy character after slandering her to make Rachel and Dex's relationship go down easier.	2005-05-19

If I see Sandra Hill's name on the cover, I know it will be good.  <br />I was not disappointed this time either. The last (for now) in her Cajun series has got all the great qualities that the others had, plus we get to re-visit the characters from the other books.

Ellis is independent yet sheltered. She knows what she wants, but is scared to go after it. By the end of the book she is learning to go after what she wants as she emerges from her cocooned life. Her grandfather's death, something she had feared for a long time coming actually became the catalyst for Ellie to finally start *living* her life instead of just simply drifting along. The romance was a tangle, and definitely not a situation most writers would put their characters into for fear of alienating the reader. I felt that it made the character seem more *real* though, because real life IS messy that way. It made it seem that much more believable. I wish that the romance could have come sooner in the book, but it would have made Ellie seem like an unsympathetic character so I understand why they author had to wait it out until nearly the end. Altogether I really enjoyed \\"watching\\" all of the relationships Ellie had (with her family members and friends) evolve. Plus there were some really fun \\"twists\\" to the story!	2005-03-31

However, Susie Bloom's story just never really materialized in this book. I really expected some interaction of some sort with her boyfriend from the first book, Casey Gordon. I knew there were going to be problems with the relationship since they were already \\"together\\", but she didn't work on those problems - she ran away from them. The so-called main characters barely share *any* scenes in the book. And while I truly enjoyed finding out the \\"rest of the story\\" on the rest of the Bloom's, they totally took over this story that I thought was supposed to be about Susie and Casey. This book mainly seemed to be about what was now going on in the Bloom family. If that is the reason you want to read this book, you may enjoy it. But I found it wandered around too much and never settled on what story it was trying to tell.	2005-03-22

It definitely had darker moments - much darker. This is *not* your ordinary \\"chick-lit\\" fiction. The storyline was engrossing though. Reading about Stella and Emily's friendship and how it evolved over the years from being barely teenagers to almost 30 year olds will make most women relive days with their own \\"best friend\\" and what kept them together over the years and what might have torn them apart. These two girls/women were closer than sisters - felt almost like sisters for most of their lives. As you read about all they have weathered together you wonder what could possibly be so terrible as to rip apart an almost life-long friendship. And you wonder whether or not this \\"thing\\" that is happening (it is kept a secret til almost the end) is going to be the death of it. There is a resolution, but you will have to read the book to see.  <br />I highly recommend this book - it was a wonderful story. The dark side of it made it all the better.	2005-03-22

The heroine is a little scared of finding her <br />\\"Thunderbolt\\" (true love) because of the tragic tale of her Uncle Mario she heard about as a child. She spends her whole life hoping she never gets struck by the thunderbolt, thinking she can avoid it by dating people she does not feel that strongly about. Yet, her thunderbolt finds her and it's not who she ever would have expected.  <br />Teddi is overwhelmed and overprotected by her mafia family, and has one true friend in Lady Di (as she calls her British friend Diana). There is a sub-romance brewing between Lady Di and Teddi's cousin Tony which is cute to see evolve as well. <br />Mostly I just loved the Italian family references and how the family interacted with one another. The author made them seem very \\"real\\" and that is what made this book endearing.	2005-02-08

It went a little deeper.  <br />You can see far more clearly than Lucy can what the problems in her life are and denial is the main problem. She has been afflicted by depression her whole life and she hasn't quite grown up enough yet to \\"see\\" what's going on around her. She doesn't even understand herself. She is not a whiny character, but she is quite naive. It's ironic that she thinks her flatmate, Charlotte, is naive (which she is) but doesn't realize it in herself. What I liked about this book is that Lucy comes to a self-realization, she emerges from her cocoon of denial and she grows as a person. She finally understands her childhood, her failures in choosing men, her parents realationship, her insecurity. As reality hits and her world is flipped on its end, she sets about to change the habits of a lifetime, she grows up, and she gets her man. Of course you have to wade through all of the \\"veil over her eyes\\" parts to get to this - and it is quite long - but the journey was worth it in the end. This was an entertaining book, I would definitely recommend.	2005-01-27

It just never seemed to GO anywhere and was bogged down by details that didn't really affect the main character. I was reaching the end of the book and was worried that Kerry's issues would not even be resolved. Then at the very last the author ties it all up in a pretty little bow - it just didn't work. The author never really got to the \\"point\\" of the story - it just seemed like there wasn't one finally. <br />A couple of main problems: <br />*Too much time spent on the problems of Kerry's friend. <br />*Not enough time developing the characters that mattered. <br />*No real storyline to follow, no climax or resolution - the character just plodded through to the end. <br />*Addition of characters who had no purpose in the story <br /> <br />Save your money on this one. It just wasn't worth it - there are better chick lit books out there.	2005-01-20

I thought the plot was very creative (not realistic, but definitely original). The plot also flowed well and interconnected without a hitch. The author ties up all the loose ends very neatly, you aren't left in the dark with certain issues as other authors do occasionally. <br />There were a few down points but nothing major enough to make me dislike the book.  <br />I would recommend this book to any girlfriend looking for a good read.	2005-01-13

It WAS interesting and I enjoyed it...for the most part.  But after I was done with it the flaws in it really stood out even more.  The main character, Sophy, is just really mean to the man she says she likes (Josh, aka the faux Dominic). I don't see how he could fall for her when she is sniping at him all the time.  Plus, as another reviewer mentioned, Josh's character is very underdeveloped. We don't get a sense of &#34;who&#34; he really is.  All of Sophy's lies were just over the top and came to be almost unbearable to read about. You just wanted to shout at her to &#34;Tell the truth already!&#34; And again, how could a man fall for someone who is so wrapped up in her own lies??? It was so unbelieveable. Sophy was almost unredeemable as a likeable character. And on top of that, she obsessed constantly about what she thought Josh was thinking instead of ever actually coming right out and asking him. (And of course, to further the story she was wrong every time.) I guess that is what one gets for ASSUMING things in the first place!  I don't know whether to recommend this book to you or not. I'd say if you are really that concerned that you won't like it, just borrow it from the library or a friend.	2005-01-13

Tessa's bodily functions were not funny, but humiliating, scenes. Both Tessa's and Max's lines to each other seem really forced - who is truly THAT candid with a new love interest? They just laid it all out there and there were no real obstacles to overcome in their relationship. The so-called obstacles were laughable: the five year age differnece between a 39 and 35 year old, the daughter was just a brat, the sister just seemed jealous of Tessa, the brother-in-law was just insane, and the &quot;servants&quot; were just all (to put it British) MAD. I can't believe I really read the whole book. It wasn't endearing that Max was angry at Tessa ALL THE TIME, but still wanted her body anyway - seemed shallow. Just was not a good story line altogether. Read Ms. Macalister's other books instead of this one.	2004-05-06

I read this book based on a little &quot;preview&quot; in the back of another book I had bought. I loved the heroine because she wasn't typical. She was considered ineligible for marriage based on a deformity of the hip that caused her to limp and that doctor's had told her she would be unable to bear children. I took away a star on this book for two reasons. The hero just wasn't &quot;all that&quot; so to speak. His manner of dress was a turn off for me and his character seemed 2 dimensional to me. And the ending seemed rushed - in the extreme! (and ended very abruptly as well I'd like to add) But other than those annoyances, the book flowed rather well. I wouldn't put it up there with the best of them, but it would make a good beach read.	2003-08-04

The \\"sub-plots\\" don't hold together well either. I was left with a host of unanswered questions:<br />1. When does this woman SLEEP?<BR>2. Why is Cole attracted to her anyway - the description of her sounds VERY \\"hooker-like\\".<BR>3. Why did she just slam the door in Nicole's face, she should have called the police on her and pressed charges.<BR>4. Why do we get to hear about Scarlett's pregnancy, but never get to hear about the birth. (why bait us and then leave us hanging??)<BR>5. How long a time span are we talking here for these two to \\"fall in love\\"? It seemed like about 3 days.<BR>6. Why is Cole so easily forgiving of all her lies? That just wouldn't fly with me. Especially for someone in charge of his kids.<BR>7. What about Ben? - also a bad subplot.<BR>8. Why did Juliet have to work so long at the bar just to pay off a lunch? Wouldn't a few hours have sufficed? Didn't she make any tips she could've paid it off with?<br />I was pretty disappointed in this book. However the author is generally pretty good and I'll still give her a try with the next book she has to offer.	2003-08-04

But throughout the whole book I kept thinking that something wasn't right. First off, David is engaged to someone else 3/4's of the way through the book. He acts like HE'S gone off the deep end and of course Callie is naturally going to be perceived as crazy when she tells him she's a witch who's turned his uncle into a dog! Even I, who mostly goes along with the &quot;suspended disbelief&quot; for the sake of the story found this very NON-believable. The main characters were too different for me to ever consider that they could have any sort of future together. Also, the time in the book seemed to jump all over the place. I got really confused several times with their time references. When I thought a certain amount of time had passed (and I'm talking days or weeks), suddenly we were way ahead or way behind what it seemed it should be. If you really want to read Liz Ireland, I suggest trying &quot;When I Think of You&quot; instead. It was MUCH better written, with a more believable and sweeter story.	2003-03-06

Jane is not your typical &quot;Barbie&quot; girl - which is a great change of pace. Finally! The brainy plain girl gets the hot guy. (kinda like &quot;The Truth about Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; in that aspect!) And Luc, while typical &quot;Ken&quot; looks, is not just a pretty face, even though he evolves from being one! Luc is just hot. Let's just say, I wouldn't mind seeing his &quot;lucky&quot; tattoo either! The dialouge between characters was believable and touching. I loved the banter. There were also times I almost cried for them. You really root for these two. This was a spur of the moment purchase for me (even though I like Rachel Gibson), and I hardly read the back cover before buying it. BUT I am wholeheartedly recommending it to all romantic fiction fans!	2003-02-14

The hero was true to his nickname, Bear. He seemed like such a love-able, huggable man. His clutziness made him seem more &quot;real&quot;. How many of us know men who are perfect anyway? He was sensitive and caring and funny. The heroine was like-able too. The author gave her a great sense of humor as well - the banter between Kitty and Bear showed the chemistry the two were supposed to share. The dates that Kitty was set up on were hilarious. It was a hoot to guess &quot;what's wrong with this one?&quot; It was a fun read, no great literature - but do we expect that in our romance? Nahh....I'm glad I picked it up.<br />Cons: Like most romances the ending was tied up too neat and quick. Plus the mushy talk gets corny once the lovebirds have sealed their fate (also a downfall of most romances, but both are mostly forgivable.) The Brownie incident was kind of dumb and contrived to boot. I think the author could have come up with something better - like making Bear Kitty's bachelor #6. (May be predictable, but it would have been sweet!) And I would have LOVED to have had an epilouge. I always want to know what happens after &quot;happily ever after.&quot; <BR>Other than those nitpicky points - I was a thoroughly satisfied reader!	2002-11-21

The last two books I've read of hers have been awful though. I don't think I'll waste any more money on her books. There was another reviewer who expressed my sentiments exactly about the &quot;hero&quot;, Alistair. Who wants a seventies hippie type hero??? Birkenstocks??? Please! - Yuck! Gray hair? No...sorry...uh uh...not doing anything for me. And Lauren, the &quot;heroine&quot;, seemed really, really immature. Not to mention airheaded, fickle, frigid, naive, and God knows what all else (but none of it very good). Did I mention immature? So, basically, heroine has nothing going for her but looks, and hero has nothing going for him but money...where does this leave us? Going to bed early, which is NOT a sign of a good book.

So this book melted my heart. I stayed up all night to finish this book. While it's not lofty literature, it IS a sweet romance. It's got the classic frustration of unrequited love, only the man is the frustrated one in love while the woman remains clueless to his feelings. The romantic tension is there. With one mis-timed kiss our hero puts thoughts into the head of our heroine. He thinks she will always think of them only as friends, so he goes about trying (but not succeeding) in trying to forget how he feels about her. And she, starts to notice him...<BR>I'm trying NOT to give everything away for you, and hope I'm doing a good job of convincing you to try this one out.

My mother gave it to me to read about 2 years ago, and I could NOT put it down. You can read the recap above, so I won't re-hash that. Yes, Vivi could be spoiled and temperamental, but she was vibrant and complex as well. I was disturbed by her treatment of her children, and NO there is no excuse for a person to treat any child in this manner. But although this is fictional and not reality-face it folks- what Vivi did is not that uncommon. Don't just sweep it under the rug and pretend it doesn't exist. And don't dwell on it as the &quot;whole&quot; of Vivi's personality, because that one episode does not define her. She was at a point where she &quot;dropped her basket&quot; and couldn't pick it up again. She was extremely depressed, and that combination with her drinking and medication took it's toll on her and her children. This book is really about the emotional journey of Vivi and her daughter Siddalee. Through Vivi's memories in her scrapbook, and through her lifelong friends (her Ya-Ya's), her daughter comes to an understanding of who her mother is and how she got to that point in her life. She comes full-circle so to speak. Sidda also learns forgive her mother and move on in her life, realizing that her mother is human and has weaknesses and makes mistakes,  and there are no guarantees in life, but that doesn't mean that you should be afraid of living! &quot;You've just got to get on the beast and ride!&quot; When I got done reading this book, I yearned for the kind of friendship that Vivi and her friends shared. It was a magical bond they had, there for each other no matter what life brought them. Through a second reading of this book, I found more complexities than the first time, and I still loved the relationship these women shared. I had removed my &quot;rose-colored&quot; glasses that I had on for Vivi, and this time around I felt her pain more than her joy for life. Maybe the third go-round I'll discover even more.It is NOT a depressing book at all - other than the one incident I mentioned. There are many great laughs to be had in this book as well. I recommend this book to any woman I know looking for a great read.	2002-07-09

I don't exactly agree with this statement. But the lives of &quot;the Saving Graces&quot; are excellently told. Although slow-paced at times, the story is beautifully written and this does not seem to hinder the telling of the tale. The book is narrated in rotation from the perspective of each of the four individuals: Isabel, Lee, Rudy, and Emma - the Saving Graces. (drawback: the changing narration is confusing at times because it is told in first person through each of them) The Saving Graces is the name of these character's women's group that, as told in the story, began about a decade before the story begins. We are told how the group was formed and what has kept them together. Then, before our eyes, each woman goes through a life-changing transformation. As you read, you will see the bond these women share, and how determined they are to be there for each other in their biggest times of need, and how they sometimes fail at that. It is definitely a celebration of the strength of women's friendships. These women do not let circumstances pull them apart. I don't wish to spoil more of the plot for you, but you will enjoy this tale of women that emerge from their personal tragedies, knowing that they had this wonderful support system behind them every step of the way.	2002-06-24

Although I wouldn't go so far as to compare this book to the Ya-Ya's, it was a fabulous tale. The main setting was a small town in TN. The main characters were three generations of women from one family. The matriarch, Gussie and her daughters, Dorothy and Clancy Jane, and their daughters, Bitsy and Violet. In addition, we are treated to viewpoints from Gussie's maid Queenie, who has been with her since Dorothy was a small child. I won't go as far as some reviewers have and spoil the plot for you, but I will encourage anyone who likes Southern fiction to read this book. Ms. West shows the trials of this family, how secrets and miscommunication can affect our lives, and how our choices change our lives. This book spans the time period from 1932 until the early 1970's. You will be touched by these women and the problems they create for themselves and how they solve them.	2002-06-17

PLEASE read this book before even considering watching the movie (although the movie was a fairly good adaption). This book is about struggles, friendships, forgiveness, and love. I did not want this book to end. I wanted to know what happened to Novalee and Americus, as well as their friends, on farther than the book goes. (For me that is the mark of well-written characters!) Be forewarned there is one EXTREMELY disturbing scene with Lexie's children that haunted me for several days. That is the only black mark for this book though.

But this time there is a twist. Instead of the man/woman being sent from modern times back into the past or vise/versa, the woman is sent from the past (1800's or so)FARTHER back into the past (ancient Rome). The characters were soul-mates. The only part I wasn't thrilled with was the ending. It was still a great book and WELL worth the read, but be prepared for a SLIGHT let-down on the ending - I won't spoil it. This was one of my favorites from Virginia Henley. I do hope she writes more books as sizzling as this one!	2002-06-04

I read &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; a couple of years ago and fell in love with it. When I found out there was a book that came before of the same characters I had to read it. The book was good and a must-read for anyone that reads the Ya-Ya's. BUT be prepared. It's definitely a more disturbing picture of Vivi. While we get a better look into Big Shep's head (Sidda's father) and learn that his compassion runs deeper than Vivi's but he just either doesn't know how to show it or feels there'd be no point to it anyway. Vivi's dark side is much more than I'd suspected having read the second book first. Her alcoholism is plain as day in Altars whereas in the Ya-Ya's she just seems to be a social drinker. (Same goes for Big Shep) And you can see more clearly the emotional scars all of her children carry and how they truly feel about their mother. This book left behind some disturbing images in my head and I wish that I had been left with the ones I garnered from reading the Ya-Ya's. One's where Vivi's motherhood crimes did not seem so vicious and contemptable.	2002-06-03

I really began to care what was going on in their lives. I'm champing at the bit to read the sequel to this book (Pigs in Heaven). Being from the South myself, I could really relate to the language of the story from Taylor's and Lou Ann's point of view. The main story is set in Arizona though, so don't go thinking this is just for Southern gals. You learn about the lives of some people that have had a bit of a rough time of it, but they are struggling through, and their lives don't seem to be quite as bleak as they think. The characters were not stereotypical that's for sure! Take a chance on this book - you'll enjoy it.	2002-06-03
US	44701443	RSWRJWIRC8THO	0440217008	77053886	Enticed (Island Books His ROM)	Books	2	3	5	N	N	not her best work	I usually love Virginia Henley's books (esp. \\"Enslaved\\"), but this book left me VERY disappointed. And though I never condemn lack of plot or so-forth for romance novels - after all this IS escapism - this story was terrible. There is not really anything to like about the hero, except that he's supposed to be handsome. There is never any REAL interaction between the heroine and the hero - nothing to give you a clue as to why she would fall for him in the first place (except that he's handsome). And for me his looks just weren't enough to build a relationship on. The poor girl goes through ordeal after ordeal throughout the entire book. The only person that truly saved her was Charles, and you really kind of start to root for poor dear old Charles. The ending was contrived. Ms. Henley needed to get Charles out of the way for Patrick and has him (Charles) kill himself. You know that Kitty has developed feelings for Charles, and yet she jumps at the chance to run back to Patrick. Kitty spends most of the book alone or with someone else. How are we to even half-way believe there is any real love between the two main characters? Save your money and read \\"Enslaved\\" instead, you'll end the book MUCH more satisfied.	2002-02-05
