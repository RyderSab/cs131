There are a few minor inconsistencies and a couple of slightly inexact explanations of the science behind clicker training, but nothing that's going to make or break a training program.  In fact, it is really hard to be exact and still speak in plain English, so that should not be a reason for the new dog trainer to avoid this book.  It will get you off to a good start.  This book has certainly gotten a lot of dog trainers and pet owners off on the right foot (or paw!) and out of the old methods that may work but result in a lot of unpleasant side-effects in our dog-friends' behavior.  <br />I have recommended this book and will recommend it again!	2004-06-29

In recent years we've learned that we can get better results with dogs, not by choking them with prong collars, but by training the things we want them to do in positive ways.  The same goes for raising our children.  <br />There are some nuggets in the book.  He talks a lot about making sure you're speaking in an understandable language to your children and your pets.  For example, in one section, he talks about a mother saying to her child, \\"Be careful!\\"  When he asks what she means, she says, \\"Stay on the sidewalk.\\"  He then asks, \\"So, when I'm driving and you say, Be Careful, I should stay on the sidewalk?\\"  It's true we aren't often clear in our expectations of our children or our dogs and expect them to know what we mean even if we don't explain ourselves.  He's right!  That isn't fair!<br />If you want children who don't rebel, you have to be ready to encourage all that is good about them.  This book seems to be about focusing on catching the bad and punishing it out of them.  He encourages the use of choke collars on dogs, and similar techniques on children... just without the physical device.  <br />But most of all, this book is about dog training by a dog trainer with a few seemingly random ties to parenting.  Harold Hansen married a woman with children and we don't know how old they are when he became their step father.  We don't know what his experiences are as a father.  We know he has been a dog trainer for a long time.  <br />There are some things to learn in here... but other books come more highly recommended.	2003-02-24

We've got a con man telling us all the amazing things he did before he was old enough to drink- passing as a pilot, a college professor, passing the bar exam without ever finishing high school, living off bad checks and not missing his family for the several years he was off in Europe swindling everyone he could there.  What are we to believe?  I don't know any sixteen year olds with the wherewithal to keep a pile successful exploits like this secret.  <br />I'd really be interested in knowing if French prisons (were/are) really like this.  Abagnale claims he spend 6 months in complete and utter darkness, naked, sleeping on a stone floor, using a bucket for waste that was only emptied every month or so.<br />Who knows?  I haven't seen the movie, and maybe it's a good one.  But is it true?  I have no idea. This is a con man, after all.  Maybe he's only as truthful as the way he made his name.	2003-02-24

I read this book while recuperating from surgery, and it was just what I needed- light and faced paced.  Lots of funny moments.  (Who can forget when Mattie got stuck in the chair?) It doesn't ask a lot of the reader, it just feels good to read it.  <br />Mattie just wants to be a good person.  She understands that she has faults, but she just wants to do the right thing and strives to do it even when the odds, her age, family and neighbors, are stacked against her. She's a Christian lady, but Edgerton doesn't turn the book into a sappy testimonial, which is a relief.  With all the trendy, schmaltzy evangelical books out there right now, it's hard to give a book with a Christian main character a chance, but Miss Mattie is as genuine as they come.<br />The book's main drawback is the ending.  A whole new crop of problems arises for the main character, 74 year old Mattie, and the book ends with her not understanding the severity of them.  I closed the book expecting the kids to put her in a nursing home.  Not the kind of ending I wanted for Miss Mattie!	2001-12-06

I thought my troubling perceptions of the Bible Belt were the result of how I somehow became a liberal in the very conservative world of the USA's south.  (I've always felt like the stork dropped me down the wrong chimney!) Chapman's observations are wry, witty, poignant, and 'right on'.  It IS a little weird down here.  Chapman is completely correct that people in the south are usually &quot;nice as all get out&quot;.  But it's also a place where people are always a little (or a lot) afraid to admit that they don't believe the Bible was inspired of God or that they support gay rights.  <br />This is some fine, honest, frank writing.  I highly recommend it.	2001-11-18

GUESS WHAT???  My blood pressure went from 142/90 to 110/64 in THREE WEEKS while eating Suzanne's way- meat, cheese, real cream, dairy butter, and rich sauces, but no sugar or starchy foods.  <br />I grew up skinny, but after my kids and several low fat diets I couldn't lose it anymore.  I GAINED on low fat diets.  With the Somercizing plan, I lost 40 pounds, then fell off the plan.  I gained the weight back (even though I had 40 more to lose) but only decided to start again when my blood pressure went high for the first time in my life.  As I said, my blood pressure went from 142/90 to 110/64 in THREE WEEKS while eating Suzanne's way- meat, cheese, real cream, dairy butter, and rich sauces, but no sugar or starchy foods.  Now it's 96/62.  <br />I had not gotten far with the new effort when I had gynecological surgery.  My doctor said I needed to eat more protein and less sugar and starch because my tissues were weak from a lifetime of eating too much processed food.  So, even medical doctors are starting to see the value of low carb diets!!  <br />No, you don't eliminate vegetables as many would have you believe.  Eat all the low-starch veggies you want, and top them with full-calorie dressings, cheeses, butter, cream sauces.  And eat all you want!  It's a godsend. They taste sweet and delicious once you train your taste buds away from sugars and starches- and that happens amazingly fast when you can fill up on all you want of steak, pork chops, pot roast, sausage, bacon, eggs, and all the things that are supposed to be so bad for you.  <br />THANK YOU SUZANNE!	2001-11-09

McCarthy's intentional misuse of written English is annoying and doesn't lend anything to the story.
