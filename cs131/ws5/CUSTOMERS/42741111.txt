Hanson's Between War and Peace is a collection of essays written between 2002 and 2003 about 9/11, the Afghanistan campaign, and the Iraq campaign.  Most of these essays were written for the National Review Online and are now reprinted here in book form.  These are excellent essays, carefully crafted, wonderfully written, logical, opinionated, often profound.  The terrorist assault of 9/11 changed our world, and Hanson well understands this.  He correctly rips apart the shallow, biased reasoning of the old world order, of the elitist media, of the boutique commentators and of the shrill leftist professors.  Hanson looks fresh at basic, critical strategies and tactics.  He calls for radical repositioning for America, but supports his arguments with carefully construed facts.  His is a conservative view, but with no apologies.  This is a must read.	2005-07-03

Along the way he is wrongfully imprisoned, serves as a slave onboard a warship, becomes trained in warfare, regains his wealth, destroys his enemy in a famous charot race, witnesses the crucifixion, sees the healing of his family from leprosy, and discovers the Christian faith.  By modern standards the book is overwritten, Ben Hur is perhaps to rigid and perfect a character (as are other characters), and the book loses some intensity after the Masala is defeated.  Still, the flavor of the age comes through.  This has been a best seller for 125 years with good reason.  A very good read.	2005-03-09

The basic premise is that character (defined as courage, steadiness of purpose & vision) matter far more than intelligence or mastery of policy in presidential quality.  Wallace uses sixteen examples to illustrate his premise and does so with simple, clear prose.  He also uses excerpts from the words of each President that explains the moment.  The book has a few factual errors, but none of them detract from the premise.  A worthwhile read.	2004-12-24

John Kerry is a must read.  Written in clear, logical prose, backed up with numerous sources, the author's fury against Kerry is shocking and impressive.  This book has become an important document in the 2004 election.  And if true, the allegations against Kerry of hyping war exploits and wounds, and of scandalous antiwar activities, leaves any fairminded reader aghast.  If a reader/voter wants the truth about Sen. Kerry, the serious allegations in this book must be soberly reviewed.  To be fair, rebuttals by Sen. Kerry deserve equal time. And these rebuttals are being well covered, depending on the particular biases of media sources, even the bitter attacks on the author of this book and his fellow likeminded veterans.  Read this book and decide for yourself.  In the current heated political climate, such a review is rare, but necessary to arrive at the truth.  After all, America is at war and is choosing its next commander-in-chief.	2004-09-12

Grant : Memoirs and Selected Letters : Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant / Selected Letters, 1839-1865 (Library of America)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A Masterpiece	U.S. Grant's Personal Memoirs is a literary masterpiece, and one of history's greatest autobiographies.  It is without question the best autobiography by any former U.S. President.  Grant writes about the Civil War, and he does so with ironic, terse, brilliant prose.  When described by most historians, Grant often--unfairly--pales when compared with his great foe, Robert E. Lee, but this book shows why Grant was such an excellent commander (and why he won).  And when you remember that Grant hurriedly wrote this while he was dying of throat cancer, and that he was fighting time to finish it so he could support his family, it gives the book added poignancy.  It is also noteworthy that Grant ignores his presidency.  He only writes about his early years, the Mexican War, and the Civil War.  This is not easy reading, but it is worth the time.  Highly recommended.	2004-08-31

He was given unprecedented access to Reagan during the presidency (his cooperation with Morris speaks volumes about Reagan's self confidence).  The book covers Reagan's life in brilliant and personal detail.  Morris introduces a new technique: he put himself in the storyline as a small character throughout Reagan's life.  This is odd, and occasionally confusing, but it allows the reader to get a complete portrait of the 40th President.  And perhaps it took this unusual technique to get a full image of this elusive man.  Morris's writing style is disciplined, his commentaries penetrating, and his research impressive.  An important book and an excellent read.	2004-08-31

This ranks on any short list of the greatest novels of the century.  The tragic tale of Jay Gatsby is a character study, with every chapter a different facet of a manufactured persona.  Gatsby never comes into complete focus, but that, oddly, is one of the strengths of the book.  And Gatsby's love for his prewar flame Daisy rings true (a love she doesn't deserve).  The other characters also are striking and brilliant.  The plot too is poignant and tragic.  And Fitzgerald's style and voice fit the story perfectly.  Highly recommended.	2004-08-25

His basic conclusion is that the war was a necessary battle (ending in a Soviet victory) in the larger cold war, and this is appropriate.  Most of his other conclusions are reasonable.  He is particularly hard on the antiwar movement, including Robert Kennedy and other liberal icons, while he often praises Johnson and Nixon.  The book does have a few weak parts.  For example, in a post 9/11 world, some of his comments about America's willingness to go to war seem dated.  Yet this is an excellent, balanced book.	2004-08-23

Its 19th century style is wordy and slow (at times) by modern standards, but that does not detract from it.  This was written in the last year of his life, and Dostoevsky focused all of his considerable talent into this dark tale of patricide.  The plot is gripping, the characters are memorable, the setting is real, and the style is excellent.  Only a few books rival it in depth, pathos and vision.  A masterpiece.	2004-07-20

Part dream, part comedy, part tragedy, part satire, Kafka works a masterpiece out of the tribulations of a common man.  Joseph K. is on trial but is never informed of the charges.  He is represented by an attorney, but the lawyer seems useless.  He attends proceedings that go on endlessly with no apparent purpose.  A host of unforgettable characters throughout the book add to his paranoia.  Joseph K. finally meets his end in an execution appalling in its polite savagery.  Through works like The Trial, Kafka's name became synonymous for those drifting though bizarre persecutions.  A fascinating book.	2004-07-05

It presents a dark world where all individuality suffers under the reign of Big Brother.  Orwell had a prophetic gift for seeing how the truth suffers from power, and how everything, including language, is cynically manipulated to suit an agenda.  In an age of brutal tyrants, ceaseless propaganda, shameless spin control, revisionary legacy tours, and mass media news cycles, this novel deserves new review.  A profound book, and a must read.	2004-06-28

Several of his major premises are unproven, and since these logical prerequisites are key to his central thesis, his whole edifice is shaky at best.  For instance, he presumes, with no evidence, that Shakespeare wrote Ur-Hamlet, and this presumption is fundamental to his later review of the play.  Other weaknesses come through as well.  He repeats through virtually every play review his deification of Hamlet and Falstaff.  He goes too far too often with little or no evidence.  Yet to be fair, Bloom's book is clearly a labor of love.   Even with its limitations this is an excellent book that is worth reading.	2004-02-24

In the Complete Sherlock Holmes, you find this peculiar, proper, analytical, brilliant consulting detective.  You also meet his equally famous boswell, Dr. Watson, and unforgettable criminals, plots and deductions.  There are four novels and fifty-six short stories.  Many of them are masterpieces.  A few, especially some of the later works, are dated and disappointing (thus only four stars).  But do not be too concerned.

Each of the kings (plus other important figures) receives coverage so that the reader has a good understanding for the background for each of the 10 history plays.  Shakespeare had limited historical references (mostly Holinshed), and he was biased at times by the need to curry to Tutor propaganda (especially in Richard III).

The information about Carolan is limited, and this detracts slightly from the biographical portion.  To be honest, however, other biographies have prejudiced our thinking.  Current writing has trained us into thinking that the writer must give a complete portrait and life story.  This just isn't available due to limited records.  What is presented is good.  Just as important is that all of the 200+ melodies attributed to Carolan are included.  This is a treasure for musicians, especially harpers.  It also gives some background on many of the pieces (the &quot;planxies&quot;).  A good book.	2003-09-29

It is by far the best of the 4 Holmes novels, and only a handful of the 56 short stories rival it in literary quality.  For a curious reader wishing to aquaint him or herself with fiction's most famous detective (and one of the 3 or 4 most famous characters in all of literature), this is a perfect start.  You'll be hooked like a happy trout on a mountain stream.  An odd metaphor perhaps, but once you read it you'll agree.  And you'll then hungrily grab all the other lures too, all 59 other stories.  Then someday looking back, you'll see that the diabolical hound that haunts the moors was Doyle's masterpiece.	2003-09-29

It is a gripping account of a tragic, bloody moment of history.  Until now this horror has too often been ignored.  Ms. Chang has changed the debate, and the truth of history now benefits.  This is a highly controversial book (many passionately disagree with it citing alleged errors), but it is well researched and carefully written.  Highly recommended.  Postscript (11/11/04): Sad news just came that Ms. Chang has died.  We have lost a talented writer and historian.  Let this book be part of her monument.	2003-09-27
US	42741111	R2JSD0UCDVAIFT	0451526341	380925201	Animal farm: A Fairy Story	Books	5	0	1	N	N	A masterpiece	George Orwell's Animal Farm is a classic, a masterpiece of fiction.  Tyrants ban this book, and you can immediately see why.  Tyranny survives on falsehood and deception.  But literature such as this can pierce the truth better than sober historical scholarship.  This exposes history's tyrants to be just what they are: coldblooded cynical liars.  This is a must read.	2003-09-27

The writing style is deceptively simple, the characters are human and likable, and the plot swift and compelling.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone.  This is a best seller for a very good reason.	2003-09-25
