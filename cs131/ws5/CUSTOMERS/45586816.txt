I love her chapter about Baby Mamas what she said is so true. So true that I cracked while reading it. The way she portrays Kim Porter is hillarious. If you want a good laugh with a whole truth (from her point of view) you will enjoy this book and her first one Wendy's Got the Heat. <br /> <br />I used to listen to her in New York everyday and now I just heard that she is syndicated here and I listen to her every chance I get. <br /> <br />Later!!!!	2005-06-21

Not to say that she is a bad author but her books seems to be about sex and only about sex without too much a story line. In the beginning Zane was the bomb and then she fell off. (Sorry to all the die hard Zane fans......) <br /> <br />Well, Afterburn is an exception to the rule. I was overwhelmed by the plot and the turn of events at the end of the story.

I think its more than just the pleasure of sex. Michael Morgan has had her share of this kind of sickness. Michael feels that she is looking for the love that her father stopped showing her once he became an alcoholic. <br /> <br />Michael became obsessed with a man named Eddie. Eddie told her all the things she wanted to hear to have sex with her. Michael wanted him to love her but he was not feeling her in that way. After sex with her got old that's when the drama was released. I felt so bad for her reading the things that she did to get Eddie to fall for her; I just wanted to jump in the book and slap the hell out of her. <br /> <br />The ending of the book was the ultimate climax. What happened really got Michael to open up and recognize her wrongs and weaknesses. I wasn't too crazy about the ending but the book still deserved 5 stars.	2004-10-24

You did not get to hear the father's point of view because he was a silent character, he was dead when you started the book. <br /> <br />The book was about 4 of his sons and how not being in 3 of their lives affected all of them, but you never get to hear the father, whose name is Street's side of the story. You hear about two the boys who are now men, mother Nadine who held a torch for him for over twenty years even though the deadbeat left her, had another son, married another woman and had a son with her. She had it for him so bad after all those years that she was seeking theraphy, now that is pathetic!!!!! <br /> <br />The story had some twist but nothing that really holds you. If you are interested in novels about deadbeast dads, like I am because my sons have one of their own, you might take an interest in reading this one, but don't think you're going to get a story with a whole lot of drama where the father gets his in the end. I will say that this book does not have its typical happy ending. <br /> <br />Later!!!!	2004-09-17

It was interesting to hear her side of view.  <br /> <br />I did not know that Bob Marley sired so many children from other woman and his excuse to his wife was, \\"I know that I can not run your body down with having a baby every year.\\" That was his excuse for having children with other women. I have to pat Rita on the back by helping Bob take care of these children, because many women including me would have not done that whether the man had money or not. I must really say she has a good heart and because of that and so many other things she continues to be blessed. <br /> <br />I found myself sad to read that Bob's life could have been saved if he had of amputated his toe, years before the cancer claimed his body, but he was hard-headed and him and his family had to pay the price. <br /> <br />I feel that Bob Marley is a musical genius that still does not receive all of his props and I commend Rita and his family for continuing his legacy.  <br /> <br />Later....	2004-09-13

Shame On It All covers the relationship between three sisters, their men and their friends. It covers their hairbrained schemes, ups and downs. Zane made you feel as if you were watching a soap opera, she even put in commercials in between the parts of the book, those I enjoyed the best and I did like it originality. <br /> <br />I didn't like the ending because it seemed very typical and as I neared the end I expected it, but then I realized I was reading Zane and she is so very predictable.

I couldn't believe how her words made me feel as if what was happening to her main character was happening to me. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone who has overcome a tragedy of any kind, whether it be from a stranger or a family member.

From the title of this book I thought it would be a little more grittier, but it took me in a whole different direction, a direction that I liked a lot. <br /> <br />Every character in this book played an important role in telling the story, there was no background characters at all. <br /> <br />When reading Ride or Die, I had the sense of a Romeo and Juliet feel with some urban flava.

This book has a good story line with erotic flavor spiced in. Not just the grit and the grime of sex but sensual and erotic at the same time. <br /> <br />The main character Darius Jones was a trip. You talking about a straight dog and conceited.....whew!!!! He wanted to and did sleep with everything moving, including his sister now that was straight up doggish. He was so busy sleeping with all the females he came across that his brother was able to embezzle money from his business. <br /> <br />I can't wait to read another installment of this family saga. I was kind of disappointed that there wasn't more of Fancy Taylor in this story but as I got to the end I realized that this story was telling how Fancy and Darius met each other and the next story will be about them, again I can't wait. Fancy and Darius' attitudes coming together is what I consider a must read!!!! <br /> <br />Ms. Morrison definitely did you thang on this one.

The issues that came up in this book are really realistic and understanding. Ms. Johnson had to have lived a part of this story herself to make is seem so real; I agree with another reviewer that is should be a movie.... a Lifetime movie. <br /> <br />The book starts off with drama and ends on a serene note with a possibility of a sequel. <br /> <br />Later....	2004-09-02

You had your nosey neighbors, bad behind kids and some real good people there. Even though some people thought it wasn't much it was home to a lot of people for a lot of years and I loved  the way they all pulled together in the mist of a tragedy, a very cruel tragedy. <br /> <br />Only thing I wish Ms. Miller could of focused more on the main character Brenda, but I guess she wasn't trying to single one character out, she was trying to focus on the buidling as a whole. <br /> <br />This book is a very good fast read, with hopes and dreams of people just like you and me. <br /> <br />Later.......	2004-08-30

I had heard rumors that Luther was hard to work with and the book has lead me to believe that that is true. <br /> <br />Luther is just a man that is frustrated by not having someone to love in his life that loves him for him and not for his money. <br /> <br />I felt sorry that he lost his whole immediate family except his mother and that is why they are so close. Luther and his mother makes me want to strive to have an even closer relationship with my sons. <br /> <br />I wish Luther a healthy recovery for the sake of his mother and his adoring fans; yes, I am one of them.

I liked the way it was spun in a web of reality with Christian overtones.<br />Most couples in today's word go through a bout of infidelity, but reading this Christian novel about it explained how you can get through by forgiving which is what God wants you to do. I was actually amazed at how the main character Kayla got through with the faith and hope of Jesus Christ. I must admit it probably would have very hard for me to do, but when I read this book I learned that the art and act of forgiving is not about you at all, its about the word of God. Its about trusting God so much that you know in your heart and soul that you can get through anything with his faith.<br />I also liked how Mrs. Murray showed how Kayla's husband was in turmoil also and that as long as he learned to forgive hisself, he would get through this ordeal; the hard part was trying to get Kayla to realize that she is a Christian and that she can be able to forgive because of his one mistake and focus on their sixteen years of marriage. Kayla and Jefferson had to learn that with God they can get through anything.	2004-07-11
US	45586816	RY3B5TOCISQCY	0060540591	653796897	Hitts & Mrs.	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Nice story but unrealistic	This story was crafted very well. It will keep you attention throughout its entirety. There is poetry and it leaves you with the hope of romance without physical gratification, but these things happen between two people who have other people in their lives, a spouse and a fiance'. Melissa and John claim that the love they have for each other showed them how much they were in love with their partners. I don't know how true that is, but it lead to a great story line, of love, passing racial lines and infidelity, I guess you can call it infidelity even though nothing physical happenened, everything was emotional.<br />So if you would like to read something touching I do recommend this book.<br />Later....	2004-07-05

This book is so underrated and never talked about. I found out about it by being on this website, no one ever mentioned it to me.<br />The story surrounds the subject of HIV and how you and many others could be affected by it and not even know it just by making a crucial mistake of having unprotected sex. It was just a coincidence that as I was reading this book I was waiting for my results of my prenatal HIV test.<br />On top of that one of the characters named Kennedy finally found love in her life and then found out that she had full blown AIDS and had to give up that love because she loved him so deep and wanted him to live his life, without it being complicated with her sickness. Now that's love, when you worry about someone else more that yourself. This book kind of reminds me of Butterscotch Blues which was also a great read.<br />I highly recommend that this book be read because of the attack we are recieving on this world from AIDS, even though it can be transmitted from more that casual sex, that is the main reason it is tranmitted though, so please get a little bit of education in this work of fiction.<br />Later....	2004-06-30

Very realistic and gritty, with messages thrown in.<br />I was very impressed that Wahida Clark wrote this book from prison, which should let anybody know that you can follow your dream no matter where you are or going.<br />The three main characters in the book were females that were living the street life but at the same time trying to obtain a collgege degree and along the way came across some tough situations with the thugs in their life.

As I read the book I thought I was reading about me, my father and my sister that I just found out I had in 2002, but it didn't take my father dying for me to find out, he just called me and told me, because she tried to contact him.<br />This book was so touching and true to life. Even though I never lost anyone that close to me, it made me feel that this is what people really go through when they lose a love one, especially one they hold a torch for.<br />I took a star off for Ms. Parry's reference to people acting like they were raised in the projects. Which way is that, I would like to know? I was raised in the projects and was raised very well.

I am so glad that I read this book. This book glorified Biggie as a everyday fella not a superstar. How good of a person he was and what he did for others including the ones that hated on him, which were many.<br />This book gave a first account on how he went for &quot;ashy to classy&quot; and how hard he tried to keep it once he found out that he really had talent for music rather than talent for selling crack.<br />What I didn't know, but really didn't surprise me was how much of a playa Biggie was. He had his wife Faith, Lil' Kim and Charlie Baltimore and I am going to say that it was more than that. It bugged me out him and Faith never even spoke to each other when the saw each other on the night he died. I guess it is true that you never know that last time you may see someone for good.<br />I love the loyalty of his true friends from St. James, mainly Lil' Cease. This book also showed you how grimey Lil' Kim really is. What devastated me that most was how his relationship between him and Tupac just crumbled over bullsh--, straight bullsh--.  If you ask me my opinion and this is just my opinion, I think Tupac what just in the wrong place at the wrong place, just like the rest of his situations. Now, don't get me wrong that's my boy too, he just makes bad judgements, just like Biggie staying out in Cali, like everything was cool.<br />Overall, this book was the best biography I ever read. It was straight up real, it made you feel as if Biggie was telling you the story of his life himself.<br />Later!!!	2004-05-30

This book was educational and enlightening.<br />In reading the book I noticed how the author barely talked about the mother in the present tense. It made me wonder what she was feeling and thinking, but as I read on I understood why.<br />When the author spoke in Bobby's voice it was very honest and poignant. I loved when Bobby realized Nia's (the mother) fate and stepped up to the plate and decided to be a single father, which is very rare in this day and age. The author also made the reader realize what a single mother goes through on a day to day basis. Very interesting book, I am going to pass this one off to my son's also.<br />Later...	2004-05-23

I just took a star away from the Cali way of talking, it was just a little too much for me, I ain't knocking it though.<br />This story is about playing the game of the streets and paying the consequences. When you realize its wrong and you need to get out, you realize it a little too late.<br />What I definitely liked about the story was how is showed the main character Lou-loc. He was very smart, but he fell prey to the streets and a dumb-a-- broad by the name of Martina, who was straight playing him out from the beginning, got pregnant from by the next man and the whole nine.

I wanted  to hop on my computer and write my review right then and there.<br />I will say this though, the cover of this book did not do it justice. I know you should not judge a book by its cover, but when you look at the cover it will make you think of it being some type of drama in the street story, but its not like that at all.

I can tell that he was telling his story just like you would be listening to someone telling it on the street corner and that is what made is very real.<br />One of the characters in the book was name Kat (I couldn't stand that b----). She was straight up wrong to Tender and Goldie. She was up in the book trying to act like a straight dude and my saying goes....act like a nugga, get it like a nugga!!!

I feel every book doesn't have to have a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending. If I am reading drama I would like the book to end in drama not a fairy-tale romance. If I wanted that I would read Danielle Steele.<br />I was interested in reading the book because it was about identical twinz and I have identical twinz, but once I started reading the book I got into it fully, then as I neared the end I was feeling let down because I saw where the book was going. I really didn't expect this from RM Johnson, I thought that if he was going to embark on some ghetto drama I though he was really going to get into it, but he just put his toes in the water.<br />I gave the book 4 stars because even though I did not like the ending it still was written very, very well.	2004-04-19

The story was about 3 friends, by the name of Tyrone, Kevin and Antoine. All their drama started when they decided to call a date line, 1-900-BLACK-LUV trying to find luv in New York City (my hometown).<br />Needless to say, you know things didn't go smoothly for them to find luv, there was drama, drama, drama. From a woman stalking Kevin to Antione falling in love with a transvestite, with a whole lot more in between.<br />What touched me the most about this book was Tyrone came into a good fortune and he shared it with the mothers of his daughters, because when he was being irresponsible they took care of his children and he wanted to repay them. Hell, I said to myself, self, I wish my twinz father would be so gracious because he is not doing jack for his sons and they are 9 years old. Okay, okay getting back to the story, that really touched my heart. I wasnt too crazy about the woman Kevin picked and you will see why if you choose to read the book. All I have to say is, I guess that's the pattern of abuse.<br />I hesitated a long time to read this book, like a good 2 years. I enjoyed the book, but I can not say that I am sorry I waited.	2004-01-12

This book was ok.<br />Ok, let's start it like this....<br />You help your bestfriend out by going to her house to help her get away from her boyfriend beating her, then you turn around and hit him in the head thinking you killed him. Not to mention the fact that this is a man you have been in love with since he was a boy and he is also the person that took your virginity, but you would not let yourself be with him because you owed another man your life because you paralyzed a man playing a trick on him.<br />Good grief, that story line was jacked up from the beginning. Call me selfish, but there is not that much guilt in the world to put your life on hold for someone else. Yes, Carmen can feel like she was in debt to Burl for the rest of his life because of his accident that she helped cause, but as fas as her love life, she can love whomever she wants.<br />If you read this book you will see that Carmen was just too dayum friendly and she let people take advangtage of her.<br />I was suprise at Mary Monroe, because this story line what just tired.<br />Later!!!	2004-01-06

I hate Christmas tales, but I could not resist the urge not to read Eric Jerome Dickey's latest. I was also please that this book was not about mushy Christmas junk. It was reality just set around Christmas. This book was about infidelity, betrayal, emotional issues, sexual hang ups, all types of drama.<br />I like how Mr. Dickey touched on how women tend to hurt each other worst then men hurt women and how men can use women to play each other and make him look like he has done nothing wrong, which is so true.<br />If you want to read a Christmas tale, without all the Christmas this is the one for you, but if you think this book has a lot of hot steamy sex that everyone else is talking about, well it leaves a lot to be desired. This book is just a good fast read.	2003-12-29

I just finished reading Wendy Williams' book last night and the first thing I am doing today is writing this review.<br />This book is indeed hot yall!!! Wendy is letting us know that she is for real, for real even though she has work on her body and her hair is fake. I am not a fan of those things but I have respect for her because she is not fronting. She let us know that she was a coke head, she went through hell and back to have her son and that her husband cheated on her. Some of you everyday women are ashamed to tell someone those private things. Yes you have a choice not too, but don't front like everything is all good when it's not.<br />I did not like that fact that she dissed us single parents or should I say the ones that had children before marriage, hell things happen, but I do understand her point when she lets us know that its better to start a relationship fresh with out the kids because its less baby mama and baby daddy drama, which is so true. I just felt she could have worded that differently.<br />I wanted to read this book just on the strength of me being from New York, Jamaica, Queens that is and I was a listeners of Wendy's when I lived there, but I was kind of apprehensive to read this book because of all the reviews I read here on Amazon, but I'm glad that didn't stop me because I would of missed out on one hell of a book.<br />Wendy's Got The Heat is just a book about a woman that could not be held down in her personal and business life, so don't hate da playa hate da game!!!!<br />Later!!!	2003-12-15

The stipulation for her to get this inheritance was for her to lose her virginity in 6 days. Well needless to say she meets this guy named Juan from the Bronx at like the very end of the book, which took a star away from the book.<br />Angelica never lost her virginity, but got the money anyway because her grandfather said in a viewing of his last will and testament that she followed her heart. Alright that's all well and good, but check this out, me myself I would have been losing that virginity to get that paper and with that I would have been following my heart and I pretty sure you would too.<br />There are some other twist and turns in the book, but I will leave that up to you to find out if you chose to read that book.<br />Later!!!	2003-11-24

I like DMX as a performer, but my admiration for him subsided when I read an article about him in Vibe magazine. I read how foul he is to his wife, by cheating on her with several different women; I guess that comes with the lifestyle, but whatever. After that I really didn't listen to his records that much because they seemed to have been getting corny, I think his first album was the best.<br />Then I read this book and I was shocked to and intrigued when I read about his life, from a toddler to who he is today. I respect the way he talks about his wife now and his kids and how much he loves them and that they are his life. I didn't not know that he had a drug problem, for some reason that really surprised me.<br />I was also surprised to find out that he was the one who came up with the &quot;spelling&quot; style of rap, that K-Solo bit off of him, for some reason I found that hard to believe. <br />I didn't like when he said that he was going to teach his son how to smoke his first blunt and that he was his dog first and his father second. When I read that I felt sorry for his son, because that means he is taking that dog stuff to seriously. He also bragged about giving his brother his first blunt and got him hook on weed. I wasn't too crazy about that but I guess that was the realness of the book.<br />Overall, the story was very interesting and I like to see autobiographies from my generation, especially those who game straight from the ghetto, like me.<br />Later!!!	2003-11-05

Wanting a man, but know he is no good for you and ignoring the one that really loves you. There was no twist to that lemon of a book at all. All of Mary B. Morrison's book are the bomb except this one. I don't know what was the point in that book. The only highlight was she reintroduced Darius Jones from Never Again Once More. Darius at the end of the book hooked up with Fancy, the main character of the book. Don't know what happened with them I guess we will have to read the next installment of this drama.<br />There was some mediocre plots to the story, but nothing to right home about or tell a friend.<br />Later!!!!	2003-10-19

She crafted this story beautifully.<br />I just love drama in fiction. I can't get enough of it, but my addiction was catered to with this novel.<br />The very first page got me with her boyfriend Travis going to jail for statutory rape.....dayum!!!!!!<br />This is not only a story of drama, but it has lessons in self-worth, self-acceptance, self-love and how to go for what you want no matter what others say around you or to you. Read the book, you'll learn something very valuable, I sure did.	2003-10-12

Even though he was leaving Chicago the next day after they slept together that didn't matter to him, he told her it was just physical. Well, that was cool with her, because she was going to nut up on him anyway.<br />Olivia was a piece of work. I was embarrassed at how she reacted over Julian. She did any and everything to get his attention. She stooped so low as to get a job at his daughter's school to be close to her, so his daughter Sam can lead her right to his father, which definitely happened.<br />This book was a very fast read. It kept me right on my toes, very enjoyable. I just took a star away for the typos.

Even though I am divorced and now back on the dating scene, I can seriously relate to this book and not at all happy to be back in the dating game and this book just depressed me. Not to say that the book wasn't good (it was great), it just showed me what I will continue to look forward to.<br />This book was about 5 women all in their twenties and their trail and tribulations of the dating game. Some got engaged and some remained single, either by choice or not, but we got to go along on their bumpy ride to their destination.<br />The characters were so vivid, it was like you were having a relationship chat with one of your girlfriends. The author hit it right on time, because that is exactly what all women go through. You see yourself in this book and you have to laugh or maybe cry and just like Erkle say, \\"Did I do that?\\"	2003-09-06

This book is right on time.<br />Please read The Harris Men and The Harris Family.<br />If you want to have more sight on how men feel when they are abandoned by their fathers....these are the books to read.<br />Even though this is a book of fiction, it is so real. I was touched by how these men yearned to be good fathers to their children though they were abandoned by theirs.<br />Twenty-five years is a long time to not have contact with your children, there is no excuse for it, but Austin, Caleb and Marcus finally came together to forgive their father before his life ended from cancer.<br />Because of their father's absence they had problems in their personal relationships. Afraid of commitment, problems in their marriages and low self-esteem, things of that nature, but in the end their father Julius help them and they help Julius.<br />My favorite character is Marcus. He is so much like me. He holds grudges and he gets sooooooo mad. He did not want to forgive his father until his wife Reecie gave birth to his daughter, that made him see that he has been bless and it was time for him to forgive his father so he can be a good parent to his daughter.<br />RM Johnson is one of the best out there.

It was very, very shallow or maybe I am getting it mixed up with her main character Tiara Bynum, who is definitely shallow. One thing I can say is that Karen E. Quinones Miller made Tiara so real that I couldn't stand her through out the whole book.<br />I think Karen E. Quinones Miller is colorstruck to some degree. She stresses the people that are light skin curly hair and light eyes. I'm sorry that doesn't make a person at all. She also makes is seem that since Tiara had hazel eyes made her the bomb diggity, which to me she was not; I felt she was a conceited witch. Ms. Miller mentioned in the book that Tiara wore a weave, well, that's telling me right there that she wasn't all that. When every situation went her way, she would say &quot;cause I got it like that&quot;. She was very rude and nasty to mostly everyone around her except her father and that was only because he bought her nice things and gave her money when she wanted it.<br />I didn't like how Ms. Miller had so much physical fighting surrounding her story,it seemed that every situation, someone had to fight their way out of it, even her father a grown man and her aunt a grown woman was in the book fighting people. What type of example are they setting for Tiara and her little sister Jo-Jo.<br />In the book's acknowledgements, Ms. Miller thanked her daughter Camille and her daughter's friends for helping her right the story and keep her on point. Pleeeeeeeeeeze...its seemed like a bunch of immature girls wrote that story instead of a grown woman protraying a story of a young girl. I am just saying that it was a poor style of writing for her third book. <br />I don't mind when author's have similar story lines but the difference is how they tell their story, but Ms. Miller did a poor job at this one. Her first two books I love, but this one left a lot to be desired. I think she may have lost a fan.	2003-08-30

When I realized that it scared me even more.<br />Thirteen and fourteen year olds having babies just to keep and boy..not a man a boy. Oh my god it just make me so happy that I have twin boys instead of girls. <br />It sad to see as you read this book how a vicious cycle repeats itself for 3 generations, very disappointing that nobody has the brains or the drive to stop it and do something with themselves besides spreading their legs or selling drugs. The sad part about it is this family came into money that they could of did something positive with and left the game alone, but being so use to proverty they chose not too.<br />With myself being from New York, even though I lived in Soutside Jamaica Queens and not the Bronx I still understood the mentality of the ghetto. I was raised in the projects but you have to want more for yourself and this family didn't want anything. I think their situation is their own fault. Baby after baby, after baby, after baby for boys and men that do nothing for them.<br />The story was very good. I loved the book. Finished it in 3 days, but it was basically about these girls having one baby after another without trying to provide for the ones they already had outside of dressing them nice and doing their hair, because they mostly had girls.<br />I still recommend that this story be read. I would recommend it to parents that have young girls.	2003-08-28

It was okay, but kind of unrealistic.<br />I think Omar Tyree was trying to make Tabitha Knight who is the main character in the book the black Heidi Fliess.<br />Tabitha Knight kept a diary of all the men she has been with who were very sucessfull men in all walks of life. She never held a job she made her money by sleeping with these men, that is how she paid her bills. Everything came to a halt when someone got wind of her diaries and wanted them from her to protect their identity and his family.<br />The story itself wasn't all that.

Mrs. Johnson-Hodges protrayed the mirror image of exactly what some females are going through in relationships, since we are now in the \\"my baby's momma and my baby's daddy\\" era. The only way to make situations like that work is through mature individuals, which we do not see alot of anyway.<br />I understand that Rick loved his daughter and would do anything for her, but he also lost something else precious in the process. I know 20/20 is hindsight, but he should have handled the situation differently. Buying a house and putting your daughter and her mother in the apartment right upstairs above your head is a little too much for me, maybe not for another female but for me, yes, not little, but waaaaaaaaay too much. Dajah, well let me just say bless her heart for her patience.<br />If your going through this situation or went through it, male or female, please take the time to support another one of our African-American authors, you will not be let down.<br />MUCH SUCCESS TO YOU MARGARET JOHNSON-HODGE!	2002-11-17

Let Basil chose what he is going to be homosexual, heterosexual or just bi-sexual. I know that confusion maybe realistic but for a book the confusion gets a little tiring.<br />The humor in the book was funny, I found myself laughing out loud at the characters' inner voices and the cracks that they made on each other.<br />I know if you're a true E.

As I got to the end of the book to see how everything ties together, believe me the knots were not secure.<br />It was not realistic in any shape or form.<br />There is no erotica in this book what so ever, so if that is what you are looking for please skip this book and move on to another. <br />I am not going to write this review to tell you about the book, because it is best to form your own opinion, but please take this advise, if you do read, there is going to be alot to be desired.	2002-07-18

I just finished it and I am reeling from it emotionally.<br />It is a whole lot of thiller with a seasoning of a love story.<br />To be honest, this book has me at a lost for words, it really touched me emotionally.	2001-09-30

This book was sooooo goooood.<br />The way the story starts you would not think that at the end all of the strings will tie together, but they tie together beautifully and suprisingly.<br />Sugar is a very strong woman and a woman who can not and should not be ignored.	2001-09-21

Felicia: missing&quot;!! Brilliant just brilliant.<BR>I kept looking at this book and putting it down without any interest, I am finally glad that I picked it up and read it!!!<BR>I can not wait until I get to the ending!!!!!	2001-09-21

Unlike everyone else, I did not like this book at all.<br />It had very unnecessary phrases in it, stuff I don't need to know like, what the person is wearing and things that does not even happen in real life. I KNOW ITS FICTION, BUT DAMN!!!<br />I read Mrs. Williams other book a Twist of Fate and I didn't like that either, maybe I just don't like her as an author. I tried twice and I'm not going back again!	2001-07-27

She fell in love with a person who had AIDS and decided to stick by him through everything. That is true love. God gave her the perfect love just not a visible love, but an emotional and spritual love. One that no matter what will never die.<br />The one thing that I object to is that Adrian should of told her everything right off the back and gave her a chance to make a choice before her heart got in the way, but hey then we wouldn't have a story.	2001-02-27
