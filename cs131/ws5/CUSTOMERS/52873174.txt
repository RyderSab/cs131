But it dates from the Ross rather than Shawn era, which means the prose is snappy rather than ponderous, and the tone amused rather than pontifical.  It's by no means a scholarly work, but significant research must have gone into it.   <br /> <br />Howe and Hummel were highly successful storefront lawyers of the 1880-1905 era, specializing in the outrageously bogus defense of the plainly guilty  (Howe) and entertainment law (Hummel), with a lucrative sideline in blackmail (Hummel).  In short, they were modern lawyers working in the gaslight era.  Today one part of their business would be advertised with billboards, a second other part would have its office in Beverly Hills, and the third would specialize in class actions, and there would be no visible connection between them.  It's perversely charming, and in a way enlightening, to see how they managed to integrate what seem at first glance to be quite disparate practices. <br /> <br />The book is a collection of anecdotes of their practice, arranged in roughly chronological order so as to provide a kind of sketchy biography of each of the principals.  It can be read in two or three sittings, as if in two or three consecutive issues of the magazine.	2005-10-03

The writing is smooth, the judgments intelligently based on evidence, the archival research prodigious.  But it leaves one with oddly little sense of Bacon the man.  Partly that's because the authors don't speculate, confining themselves to the historical record.  That's a great virtue, but it also means we never get a sense of Bacon's relations with his wife, or even his sexuality.  We hear about his chronically poor health, but not what his symptoms suggest to a modern doctor.  Also, the authors don't examine Bacon's  writings in any sort of detail.  This is definitely a \\"life and times\\", not a \\"life and letters.\\" <br /> <br />The authors rarely step back to give an overall picture.  There are no scene-setting panoramas, no authorial intrusions to explain why, for example, they decided to go into such detail about the activities of Bacon's brother Anthony.  One gathers that the authors believe Anthony and Francis were working closely together, but I would have liked to have their thinking explained more fully.  (Although Anthony is practically the main character of the first quarter of the book, his death is mentioned only in passing.) <br /> <br />These criticisms reflect my occasional irritation with the book, but they don't detract from the authors' tremendous achievement.  If the authors had included everything I missed, the book would have been quite a bit fatter, and that would have been a negative, too.  As it is, the book is (just barely) small enough to be read without risk of injury, unlike so many other modern biographies.   <br /> <br />The book contains a great deal about Bacon's political activities, as another reviewer has noted.  That's because a great deal of Bacon's life was occupied with political activities.  If all you want to read about is Bacon's scientific works, you shouldn't read a biography of their author.  In the case of Isaac Newton, there is practically no difference between the life and the scientific work.  But in Bacon's case, there is not only a difference but a dichotomy.  He was a successful lawyer and politician who also happened to kick-start the Scientific Revolution. <br /> <br />To summarize, Hostage to Fortune provides all the details, but not the outline.  My advice would be to familiarize yourself with the basic course of Bacon's life and his achievements before reading this book, so you can fully appreciate its richness.	2005-10-03

Apparently he's supposed to be sympathetic because he's too self-centered to actually believe in the Nazi cause he advances so brutally.  Lots of sex that is either commercial, manipulative or outright rape.   <br /> <br />From time to time the narrative switches to a  mystery set in 1990s Lisbon, and it takes until about page 250 before the storylines interconnect.  But because so few pages are devoted to the modern mystery, it never gets going -- it's little more than a novella, and not at all mysterious. <br /> <br />This book has received rave reviews and prizes mainly, I think, because a lot of people like to identify with the Nazi brute.  It's a fantasy of power, rather like a Schwarzenegger movie, with the difference that in this case you're asked to identify with the bad guy.   <br /> <br />This would be an excellent book to read if you're looking for something to buck up your resolution to kill yourself.  After reading it, you would feel perfectly justified in concluding that  every human being is a monster, all virtue is a sham, and success is never anything but the reward of treachery. <br /> <br />The writing is a notch above the merely competent, which is why it gets two stars instead of one.	2005-09-11

He had a mercurial personality and progressive political views.  He was, in short, one of the most interesting people who have ever lived.  Unfortunately, Helferich writes like a committee.  His prose is clear in the way a company's annual report is clear.   As a study of Humboldt's South American journey, the book is 100% derivative but it provides some basic information and has the advantage of being readily accessible.  Basically the book is a retelling of Humboldt's own narrative, with too-few asides providing modern information on topics to which Humboldt turned his curiosity.	2005-06-22

Seriously misleading subtitle.    An introduction that gives away most of the book's conclusions.  Breathless feature-page prose.  All of these flaws are based on the assumption that the book was not intrinsically interesting and had to be tarted up.  Which is a shame, because Leavitt's insights are actually interesting.  I give Leavitt's contributions five stars, but William Morrow's and Stephen Dubner's contributions one star, which leads to the compromise rating shown above.    A lot of reviewers, you'll notice, rate the book based strictly on Leavitt's provocative analysis of statistics relating to crime and abortion.  Whether the book is worth reading, apparently, depends on whether it supports your preconceived views -- proof that you can give people data but you can't make them think.	2005-06-22

Enfield is amusing, insightful, sympathetic -- a pleasure to be around.  He seems to be without the least hint of shyness or self-consciousness, and equally without the least hint of brashness, a combination that Americans find almost impossible to achieve.  This is an account of two bicycle trips through Greece, taken in his mid or late 60s, and both are described in loving detail.  He meets all sorts of people and condescends to none of them, and even tosses in some rather moving history.  The book is mostly a travelogue with some elements of guide book intermixed.	2004-12-08

He was captured in 1943 and tortured in Auschwitz, but survived to make the experience the subject of his greatest work, published in English as \\"At the Mind's Limits.\\"  After the war he moved permanently to Belgium and discarded his German name (Hans Mayer), replacing it with the French-sounding anagram under which his subsequent works were published.  Like so many survivors of Nazi torture, he ended his own life.  The essays in this collection are not profound in the same way as his Auschwitz book, but they describe the workings of a brilliant mind confronting a universal experience.

His goal with this book isn't to sketch in McKinley's life but to argue a thesis.  His thesis is that McKinley was a important president, and the thing that makes him important is that he illustrates Phillips' career-making mega-theory about realignment politics.  It's a campaign strategist's view of history.<br />Phillips doesn't seem to have consulted any primary sources at all.  We get a lot of &quot;he must have reflected&quot; stuff, and assertions that McKinley deliberately wore a mask of conventionality, and that his blandness was a conscious strategy, etc., with no attempt to demonstrate the historical validity of any of it.<br />Still, there is some good stuff about Ohio's political centrality in the post-Civil War era, and a very good summary of the gold-silver debate, which was a matter of passionate interest in the 1880s and 1890s but is so baffling to modern Americans.	2004-06-02

It is strictly a battlefield history, and very much a top-down history at that, written at times as if the generals themselves were going at it hand-to-hand.  Editorially those are reasonable decisions (it's long enough!), but they are also decisions that make his pro-Confederacy sympathies easier to take.  If one were reminded that the War was, among other things, a fight to end slavery, Foote's idealization of Southern generals could make one feel a bit queasy.<br />He presents the Southern officers as gentlemen to a man, even Forrest, while he rarely misses a chance to question the motives and decency of Union officers.  After a while his descriptions of Ulysses Grant become funny -- even while ransacking Grant's memoirs for vivid quotes he cannot stop himself from making little digs, questioning his motives and denigrating his competence, his ethics, his character, you name it.  The reader begins to wait for the next gibe, which is never long in coming.<br />There's something profound about the Southern historical consciousness expressed there.  Even a liberal intellectual writing almost a century after the fact cannot forgive Grant for winning.  (Or, perhaps, for overseeing Reconstruction as President.)<br />If you look past the editorializing, which perhaps can be justified as a corrective to triumphalist accounts from the North, Foote presents the evidence fairly.  If what you want is a vivid account of the major military actions, this is the book for you.  If you want to know about the causes and effects of the Civil War, or its impact on civilians, especially blacks, look elsewhere.  But if you want to know the way the war continues to influence the minds of Southern intellectuals, just read between the lines.	2004-04-18

His weaker mysteries are better than 99% of the stuff being published.  Still, Murder in Mayfair reads like it isn't quite finished.  There are long static scenes of dialogue and one unbelievable coincidence (involving the location of two flats) that makes no difference to the plot.  The resolution is not a surprise and, worse yet, relies on a deus ex machina.  It reads a bit like a draft rather than a finished novel.  <br />Read Barnard's other political mysteries -- Scandal in Belgravia and Political Suicide -- first, and then this one.	2004-03-11

Over and over, like the old Flash Gordon serials or the Batman TV show.      A lot of people seem to love the doomy atmosphere of this John Le Carre imitation and the \\"what if\\" fantasies that form the plot, such as it is.  The fact that all the twists are telegraphed pages in advance flatters the audience while contributing to the sense of fatalism.  The writing is literate but pretentious (like le Carre's, only slightly worse).    Drawing realistic humans is not Furst's strong point and the protagonist's recollections of his life clang embarrassingly.  You can always tell when a flashback is coming, like movie musicals when everyone starts acting funny and you know a song is about to start.  If you skip over those parts you'll enjoy the book more.	2004-01-04

Was he writing an in-depth scholarly work or a popular once-over-lightly?  There are no footnotes and the bibliography is woefully inadequate, like popular history, but some passages go into great detail, like a scholarly work.  Throughout the writing is awkward -- every page or two there's a sentence you have to read twice.<br />There are some startling mistakes.  Two paragraphs on Billy the Kid and the Lincoln County War (pp. 175-176) contain at least a half-dozen factual errors and exaggerate the death toll by a factor of ten.  Since the book came out after the scholarly studies by Frederick Nolan, Joel Jacobsen and Robert Utley, there is no excuse for this.  Similarly, the statement that the federal government appointed sheriffs and town marshals in the western territories (p. 173) is flat wrong.  These just happen to be areas I know about, and it makes me suspicious that many other errors exist in discussions of fields I'm unfamiliar with.  <br />My guess is that Lane wrote with authority about the subjects he is interested in, such as Philadelphia's history, and just slapped together connecting passages about subjects that bore him, such as western history, relying on his memory rather than research. So while there are many good things, there are also many bad things.  All in all, more frustrating than enjoyable.	2003-12-06

Some extremely funny moments.  But while Bryson is all in favor of environmentalism in theory, he doesn't actually like being in the woods very much.  His self-involved intellectual slapstick works best in the company of those who see their task in life as frustrating or annoying him.  He's a kind of George Burns to the world's Gracie Allen, the latest in a long line of comedians who start as rational, hopeful people and wind up tearing their hair at the absurdity that assails them.  The bits describing what happens between meetings with strangers -- that is, the actual walking of the trail -- are perfunctory.<br />Bryson's ex-buddy Katz returns from &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; though I wonder if there's any real person corresponding to him.  I suspect he's just a literary device.  He's everything Bryson is -- sarcastic, out of shape, an inexperienced hiker -- only more so.  He's an exaggerated version of Bryson himself, making him a good comic foil.<br />One worrisome trend is that Bryson describes himself actually saying mean things to people instead of impotently thinking mean thoughts about them, as he did in earlier books.  Is success making him arrogant?  <br />The tone is wildly uneven.  The set piece descriptions of the trail are interesting in a National Geographic sort of way, but are conventional in the way in the way his humorous passages never are.  His attempts at nature description are flat and seem merely dutiful -- the sort of thing one has to do when writing this sort of book.  His use of British colloquialisms sometimes seems affected.  His discussions of public policy are trite and sometimes self-contradictory, giving the impression of having been dashed off at an editor's insistence while the book was already in proofs.  Those bits account for about 2/5 of the book.  The other 3/5 is vintage Bryson -- which is why I give the book 3 stars.	2003-04-18

It has an entry for every legal hanging in New Mexico since the coming of the Americans.  Most of the hangings occurred during the long territorial period, 1850-1912.  The entries are organized by county.  Each entry begins with an introduction by the author, apparently drawn from contemporary newspaper accounts, to judge from the lists of sources.  Some of the introduction are bare-bones, others go into detail.<br />Each entry continues with a quotation from a contemporary newspaper.  Often an entire article is reprinted.  The papers almost always described the execution itself.  Reporters, and presumably their readers, seemed to be very interested in the sheriff's skill with the noose, noting with approval when the neck was broken and death followed quickly, and disapproving when the prisoner strangled to death or (as in the case of Thomas \\"Black Jack\\" Ketchum) was decapitated.<br />As this description makes clear, and the title ought to warn you, this is not a book for the faint of heart.  That said, the author's descriptions are never sensational; indeed, they tend to be rather dry and factual, which adds to their value -- the author doesn't get in the way of his material.  The contemporary newspaper accounts are more colorful, as was typical of the age, but even they are rarely heartless or gleeful.<br />All in all, a wonderful concentration of information.  The author's prose style is pedestrian and he makes no attempt at synthesis or analysis, but he succeeds admirably in what he set out to do, which is to present the fruits of persistent research in a clear, straightforward format.	2003-03-13

Power to Hurt is a very good book that might have been made even better with a little editing.  At times it reads like an earnest slice-of-life novel, the type that asks the reader to spend a little more time than necessary inside the heroine's head.  But she is, indeed, a heroine, and the book is quite moving at the end -- something that can't be said about many true crime stories.  <br />The book only takes us up to the midpoint of the judge's career.  It ends with the full Sixth Circuit hearing the case \\"en banc.\\"  Soon afterward, in a bizarre ruling, a majority of the court's members held that a judge's sexual assaults (some committed while he was literally wearing his black robe) did not constitute a civil rights violation because the US Supreme Court had never explicitly ruled that they did. That type of reasoning, needless to say, never stopped them or any other federal court from finding a civil rights violation when a cop or prison guard assaulted someone, but judges, you see, are different because, well, because the Sixth Circuit is composed of them.<br />The US Supreme Court reversed -- unanimously -- and sent the case back to the Sixth Circuit with instructions for it to get real.  But then Judge Lanier, who'd been out on bond all this time, skipped off to San Diego where he lived under an assumed name.  He eventually slipped over the border into Mexico.  The Sixth Circuit ordered him to turn himself in and when he failed to do so, it dismissed his appeal, finding that by showing disrespect for the court he had forfeited his right to ask it for assistance.  Just a day or two after the dismissal, the judge was arrested in Mexico and brought back to the States.  (Was the timing coincidental?)  To the end he had his supporters on the Sixth Circuit -- incidentally a spectacularly dysfunctional institution, with judges who aren't reluctant to go public with their mutual loathing -- but he's safely locked away now.	2002-10-26

It is intensely personal, written in Rebecca West's characteristic tone of bullying good sense.  It describes with great insight personal relations between a number of sharply-drawn &quot;characters&quot; in a distinctly novelistic way.  It also provides a vivid travelogue of a long-lost age, by now nearly as remote as the middle ages, irretrievably lost to us behind the triple cataclysms of World War II, communism and Milosevic.  Finally, long digressions in the book provide an impressionistic presentation of Yugoslavian (mainly Serbian) history.<br />The weakest part of the book, in my opinion, is the dialogue, which is frequently stilted and for that reason detracts from the immediacy of the travelogue.  West's unnamed husband -- referred throughout merely as &quot;my husband&quot; -- is made to talk exactly as West herself writes, and unsurprisingly he and she always agree.  But that the book should contain considerable dialogue, and that of distinctly intellectual cast, in itself illustrates its uniqueness.<br />Reviewer Edo Bosnar's main complaint, it seems, is that the book is not something that it makes no claim to be.  It's not a textbook of Balkan history or politics, nor is it presented as a work of scholarly research or interpretation.  It makes no pretense of being fair -- fairness doesn't enter into it.  What makes the book so compelling, in my view, is precisely that it doesn't fit into any category.  It's not just a book, it's a genre all its own.<br />I write as a person who believes that no book should exceed 300 pages without some very good reasons.  Black Lamb and Grey Falcon has some excellent reasons for its great length.	2001-01-12

Much of the information confirms those of us who have always suspected two day old kids are as intelligent and tuned-in as, say, the typical graduate student -- they just have fewer ways to express it, and less experience to build on.<br />  Better yet, the book is written in a thoroughly engaging and often humorous style that possibly owes something to the first named author's brother, the New Yorker writer Adam (or, more likely, both Gopniks inherited the same literary genes).<br />But don't expect pointers on burping technique.	2000-10-31

For this volume, author Patterson has made the decision to organize his  book thematically rather chronologically.  In my opinion, this decision was  nothing short of a disaster, because the structure ensures that no  narrative momentum or continuity is established.<br />The book reads like a  series of monographs.  But they are not scholarly monographs, since the  sources are exclusively secondary (even when prominent public figures are  quoted and the original sources would be child's play to locate). The first  two volumes of the series were scholarly works in the form of popular  storytelling.  What we have here is the opposite -- a rehash in the form of  academic research.  It doesn't help that Patterson's political discussions  rarely go deeper than a Time magazine article.<br />Compared to Battle Cry of  Freedom or The Glorious Cause, this book is a nearly total failure.  Still,  it's much better than most academic history in that it presents a fair  amount of information without shaving the facts into evidence to support  some narrow little argument, it totally avoids jargon, and there's no  score-settling with academic enemies.  So it gets two stars on the basis  that it could have been worse -- it could have been like most of the stuff  produced by our history departments.	2000-01-08

The author presents herself &quot;warts and all&quot;, which makes for a few passages of uncomfortable reading, as if you're eavesdropping on a private conversation.  She's a bit mean to one crew member, but balances it with generosity towards another, and by her  deeply felt concern-edging-towards-despair for her aging expatriate parents.  The result is an amazingly detailed self-portrait -- after reading this book, you'll know Lydia Bird, good points and bad, as well as you know your closest friends.  But it all comes back to the sailing, which is rendered in vivid, sometimes breathtaking detail.	1998-07-22
US	52873174	RSEE6IFW1LN0K	0385478240	411747318	Understand This	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Wonderously various perspectives by a brilliant writer	Tervalon can write.  There's not a sentence that doesn't fit.  Every word is in exactly the right place and contributes to the whole, and yet the writing is so restrained and understated that you have no sense of the author's presence, but only of his many, extraordinarily vivid characters.  The plot is the least interesting part of the book, but still it hooks you.  The book, like life, has its melodramatic moments, but also moments of humor and lots of sympathetic insight into a host of interesting people trying, with varying degrees of success, to make the best of their lives.  The abiding feeling left by the book is not the cliched angst of urban hopelessless, etc. etc., but something far more positive and difficult to describe, because the world of this book is far too complex and finely-drawn to be summarized in any string of adjectives.  A terrific book.	1998-07-22
US	52873174	R531WDUI3YNV0	0679447024	193723058	Black Leopard	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A first-rate eco-thriller that is also an excellent novel.	A thriller for those who like to think and read at the same time.  There's action and sex, all right, but they involve well-drawn and sympathetic characters, including the field biologist David Trowbridge from the author's previous &quot;In a High and Lonely Place.&quot;  There's a hair-raising look at what goes on in the backwoods of West Africa -- &quot;lawless&quot; isn't quite strong enough  -- and an equally-revealing glimpse into the political structure of a country that seems to bear some resemblance to the Ivory Coast, where the author worked as a diplomat.  There's a geo-political angle that sounds like the real story behind familiar headlines out of Africa, and fascinating insights into the lives of chimpanzees, forest leopards and forest elephants studied by Trowbridge and a team of Belgian biologists he encounters in the field.  All of it is seamlessly woven into an elaborate plot that will keep you guessing to the very end.<br />The book brings to life an enor! mous variety of people, from ordinary (and not-so-ordinary) Africans in steamy villages to their &quot;maximum leaders&quot; in air-conditioned offices, from a cool Lebanese businesswoman to a frightened American smuggler, from high-minded scientists to clever thugs -- plus animals as vividly drawn as the humans in most books.  &quot;Black Leopard&quot; is a great thriller and a rich and satisfying novel.	1998-07-22
