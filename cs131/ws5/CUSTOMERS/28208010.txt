US	28208010	RM3KW2689SR0	0812966007	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	4	2	2	N	N	TR - unsubtle, but memorable	(this is for the audio version) <br />I sometimes wonder whether my history teachers were bad or I was too unengaged to listen to them.  Of course I knew of Roosevelt's involvement with the Panama Canal, and his role in preserving land out west, and vaguely remembered some things about anti-trust laws, but it wasn't until a few years ago that I re-discovered him through quotes that appeared in business books, women's rights discussions and international press.  I've read (and listened to) several books about TR now, and this is the best.  It is literally his years as President, from the day McKinley was assassinated to the day he left office.  TR's intellect and the way in which he yielded power are well portrayed in this book.  He used some advisors intensely while shoving others away.  The word \\"dynamic\\" may have been coined for TR.  I suspect that anyone who said \\"well, that's never been done before\\" to him was thrown out of his office....TR was nothing if not creative (probably too much so in terms of the Panama Canal - was it really worth overthrowing a country to get that land?) <br />This book is engaging and rapidly paced.  It's also a very interesting snapshot of life 100 years ago.  I was surprised to learn how few days Congress was in session, for example, and of the time TR spent in a wheelchair. Also, I never knew of his connections with George Washington Carver, nor how much trouble TR got into by simply inviting the man to dinner.  I also developed a greater appreciation of the hold the business magnates of steel and rail had over the country.  The description of the coal strike and its resolution are worth the price of the book, but it's TR who holds the story together, and TR who will stay in your memory.	2005-05-17

As others note, this book is sort of a guide to his bishops about how he expected them to behave and what he expected him to do.  But it's also a guide to the flocks, as it were, as to what we should expect of our bishops. <br />He also gives some details about his own calling and his education as his proceded from priest to Archbishop to Cardinal to Pope.  I can count on 2 hands the number of times I've heard a priest (or Archbishop) talk about how they came to realize their vocation and it's fascinating learning John Paul's perspectives on knowledge, culture, theology, world religions, etc. <br />This book should be required reading for all bishops as well as for those of us who need them to be active members of our churches, not distant figureheads.  Wilton Gregory (formerly of IL, now in GA) seems to fit John Paul II's mold of bishops who serve the people, but few others I've met do. <br />This book is also good for giving us glimpses of Wotyla the man who became Pope, and his love for kayaking and skiing and hiking, and reminds us keenly of the intellect and soul of the Archbishop and Pope who stood against the Nazis and then the Communists, with his faith to guide him in action when fear made others immobile.	2005-04-15

Some talked about why he was the first President since Jefferson was more intelligent, etc.  Our teacher let the conversation go on and then asked a question - if Jefferson was smarter and Franklin was quicker and Adams a better diplomat why did so many of them turn to Washington and say \\"you go first\\"?  Why did THEY look up to HIM?  I've always remembered that question and was pleased to see it restated in Eliis' introduction because, for me, it cast Washington in a completely different light then AND since.  He's not the man on the dollar bill or the quarter or in the stoney-faced portraits.  He IS the man who was out surveying land in his teens, <br />who led troops into several disastrous battles early in his life, <br />who married one of the most prominent widows in the Commonwealth of Virginia, <br />who managed the complex and beautiful estate of Mt. Vernon, <br />who put together the coalition of troops in the Revolution, <br />who stood up against the government from whom his ancestors had profited, <br />who played politics with the best of them, <br />who started some of the best traditions and standards of the country, among them the legacy that the country's military must have a civilian commander. <br />These are all pieces of George.  Not Mr. President, not \\"his excellency\\", not \\"General\\", but George, the man, and Ellis tells about the man very well indeed.	2005-02-16

Crushes, money, parents, body changes, siblings, friends, school - it all gets to a teenager at some point (no matter when you grow up). <br />Meredith has been able to step back from the daily issues and, rather than fuss about things that are hard, casts some perspective on these issues as she has lived through them.  Even better, she's done so with good humor and clarity. <br />I hope Meredith enjoyed writing this book as much as we've enjoyed reading it.	2005-02-11

And when the cast comes off your leg is small and wrinkled because of the muscle atrophy that took place during the weeks of inactivity while the cast was on? Have you ever wondered what a bear looks like when it comes out of hibernation, having spent 3 or more months lying around mostly sleeping?  Are its muscles smaller?  Bernd Heinrich's mind thinks like that, putting such questions together and then he goes off in search of an answer. <br />If you only weigh a few ounces and are covered in feathers and it's -30 deg outside tonight, how do you live till morning? And why is it a good thing if there's fluffy snow on that evergreen tree? Heinrich knows. <br />This book is all about how animals live through brutal weather, and the word \\"ingenuity' in the title is a fine descriptor.  For us indoor folk, 20 deg is cold, but for some animals who can make it to -40, that's a cakewalk, and Heinrich will tell you how they do it.  It's a wonderful set of stories and observations and scientific fact about many different animals. <br />I still don't know how it came to be that I found a turtle dying in my garden on a 10 deg day recently (why was he/she out in the first place?), but I know more about why I'd better go fill my birdfeeders before the sun sets so the birds will literally have energy to burn when it's 15 deg tonight!	2005-02-11

While the reader does a wonderful job with the changing Irish accents, Dublin vs. Leinster, Ulster vs. Munster, educated vs. \\"regular folk\\", the abridged version is even harder to follow than some have described the written.  Just when you start to get to know a character, they're gone and you've jumped ahead a few hundred years and the ties between the stories are thin. <br />Rutherfurd follows some of the styles of James Michener in that he takes a geographical place and weaves the people and history in and around it.  But it doesn't work here and while I love the sound of the Irish voices, the story leaves me wishing Michener had written about Ireland.	2005-02-02

It took me a while to figure out what bothered me about this biography, and then decided that it's because the book is as much about Scott Berg as it is about Kate Hepburn, and I don't really care all that much about Scott.  As other reviewers have noted, much of this material has been covered by other biographers and in books by Hepburn herself (if you haven't read her story of the Making of the African Queen, go find a copy). <br />If you want to read about how Hepburn interacted with others (generous, funny, demanding, imperious - pick one depending on the setting), you might learn something from this book.  If you want to learn about how Berg made the most of an invitation to dinner, and, perhaps, what about him so interested Hepburn, this book is worth your time. <br />It was interesting that at one point Berg sort of looks down on Warren Beatty using a private piece of information about Howard Hughes for his own gain, information which Berg had gotten from Hepburn, when Berg's whole book is private information about various people which he's using for gain.  I guess the difference is that Berg had Kate's permission.  For my taste, I would have rather read more about Hepburn, and less about the biographer.	2005-01-04

I don't remember when I started reading FBoFW, but I've been reading it so long it's been a part of every day for (sigh) a quarter of a century.  The family has been so real I often wondered how many of the stories were about the Patterson family and how many were fiction, and this book answers some of those questions.  I remember a strip, which is part of this collection, of Elly and John lying in bed wondering whether they were dealing with young Michael in the best way, agonizing over the decisions they were making.  Then in the last frame, cut to Michael lying in his bed thinking it must be wonderful to be a grownup because you always know everything! <br />The strips are nice memories, though some of the cuts between topics may leave new readers wondering about the gaps. The new essays about family members add interesting facets to some of the stories in the strip and how it evolved from a nice (though insightful) strip about a young family into commentaries about life, death, society and every family's wishes.  Johnston lost some fans when she embraced some of these issues, but she gained millions more. <br />I know I'll miss FBoFW when Lynn Johnston retires, but the decades we've shared have been wonderful, and I look forward to the stories she'll tell between now and then.	2005-01-02

This book by the Irish Tourist Board is written by people who know, love and travel the country.  It has just enough history to be fascinating.   From Newgrange in the east to Staigue Fort in the west, from the Rock of Cashel to the Giant's Causeway, from the oceans to the salmon streams, from the bustling streets of Dublin to the quiet country around Emly and Kilteely, this book is about IRELAND.  It does talk about places to eat and drink, but it concentrates on the country, and what to see to sample its fantastically unique soul.  Dublin and its environs, especially, have changed a lot in the last 20 years, and this book both talks about why it has, and how to get around this new/old place.  Some of the history in the older editions is gone from the newer one, probably for space reasons, but the book still points you in a lot of very good directions.  The newest edition (2001) includes pre-designed trips and things to do inside and outside (in case it rains...).  The maps in the new edition are very good and the book is bound tightly with a cover than bends nicely and with flaps to serve as bookmarks - all features that make this book easy to take with you and easy to use.  One complaint - some of the printing is laid on top of an image that goes from light to dark but the printing remains 1 color.  This makes some of the pages hard to read.  But a small point in such a great book.	2004-12-06

Fascinating review of the utilization of PowerPoint, its good and its bad points, mostly its bad. <br />Tufte cites Norvig's stunning PP of Lincoln's Gettysburg address and NASA engineers' PP of the Columbia disaster as examples of PP gone bad, and he explains why. <br />As anyone who has had their mind-numbed by one of 300,000 PP backgrounds or 25,000 animations will tell you, a key problem with PowerPoint boils down to this - you can either use it as a tool or as a crutch.  How do you know the difference?  Our guideline - if you can give your talk without PP, it's a tool.  If you can't....... <br />Tufte excels at breaking out the good vs. the bad - there is hope for PP usage, but it has to come from the mind of the user, not the authors of the software.	2004-09-28

A. Hunter does a wonderful job of summarizing the horses' greatest races and then tying them back to the ancestors' performances.  For example, who was \\"Teddy\\" and why does he matter so much to the horses running today? <br />Some horses are as great on paper was they are on the track, but why does it seem that some horses come out of nowhere and succeed when nobody in their family has ever accomplished anything?  Or did they?  Is somebody great lurking back there in the grandsire or great-granddam spot in the pedigree? <br />If the numbers are dry, the text is anything but.  It's easy to say \\"this horse was first, this one second\\", but it's an art to convey the effort and the struggle or, for that matter, the ease with which some horses became legends. <br />My only wish for change in this book would be to add more pictures.  Surely the Racing Museum or whoever holds the rights to Robertson's Thoroughbred Racing in America could provide more images.  Yes, it would make the book even bigger, but while it's great to read about the blood ties, it's even better to see the slant of a shoulder in the filly that reflects the same power in the grandsire.	2004-09-23

I've always thought there was a doctoral dissertation lurking in cartoons on the pages of the New Yorker, and now I'm sure of it.  Look at the difference in style and content across the decades, look at the cartoons that were funny in 1950 and see what is still funny now and what has become outdated, look at the vast changes in cartooning! <br />But most of all, just look at all of these thousands, no, tens of thousands of cartoons and have a good time.  The book is gold, with its 2,004 cartoons, and the essays about the decades and the artists are very well done, but if the book is gold, then there's platinum in the CDs. <br />One thing - if you're a Mac user, as I am, be aware that you really need OSX to make this work (a detail some purchase sites don't mention).	2004-09-23

Not ponies on Chincoteague, not stallions in Lipizza, not burros in the Grand Canyon, but a fox.  Cinnabar is a red fox (a family man fox, no less) whose days overlapped with George Washington.  The story revolves around Cinnabar and his gourmet wife and their children and all the trouble he goes to to get a chicken for dinner.  The fox hunt is a little scary for very young children, but it's what my grandmother would have called a \\"rollicking story\\", and a very unusual topic for the always successful Henry/Dennis team.	2004-09-17

As with most of her wonderful books, the bones of the story are true but the flesh is fiction.  That's ok, because I don't think she ever represented them otherwise.  The drawings by Wesley Dennis remain spirited and captivating. <br />As others have noted it is important to keep our view of ecology in mind, that the cougars who are villains in this book, are valuable natural predators in the Canyon while the burros, who are cute heroes here, are destructive immigrants.  As someone else said those changes in perception would be great teaching points.  It's interesting that a cougar is a \\"bad guy\\" here (and I suppose from the burros' point of view they sure are bad guys) because in another of Henry's books, a different predator, the red fox, is a great and funny hero (Cinnabar, the One O'Clock Fox) who even outwits George Washington. <br />But be that as it may, Brighty is a fun story and he will introduce you to the varied levels of canyon life (rim vs. river).  My brother recently returned from a river trip in the Canyon and I gave him this book to read about the Bright Angel Trail he'd walked. <br />I wouldn't recommend this book to very small children because Brighty does get hurt several times, once very badly.	2004-09-17

As they say.....one picture is worth.......

Well, they're pussycats (or maybe Shetland ponies) compared with the folks who argue about the best racehorse ever.<BR>This book, from the staff of the BloodHorse, is great material, whether you agree with it or not.  It's the top 100 racehorses of the 20th century, at least if they raced in the US at least once, and were flat racers (steeplechasers are usually Thoroughbreds too, but if they came to glory over the jumps, as Man O'War's great son Battleship did, don't look too hard for them here).<BR>But the great flat racers are here, from Phar Lap to Shuvee and Dr. Fager to Forego.  Their pictures and their pedigrees and the stories about them are all well done, though I wanted more than 2 pages about many of the horses lower on the list.<BR>The hotly debated #1 pick was Man O'War, who carried 130 pounds as a 2 year old, ran distances from sprints to 2 miles, was almost never allowed to run all out (racing many times with his head pulled into his chest) and was beaten only by a starter who opened the race when he was standing sideways....well, you can guess where my bias lies.<BR>It would be great to line Man O'War, Secretariat, Dr. Fager, Forego, Kelso, Phar Lap and a few others up at Belmont for a mile and a half challenge on a cool, sunny autumn morning.  Since we can't do this, we'll just have to hash out our opinions and sort out the facts - and this book is well designed to help us to just that!<BR>(oh, and my favorite horse of all time is well down the list at #46 - Majestic Prince - I wept when he limped off the track at Belmont, never to race again, but he's placed about right here since he never carried weight and never raced against older horses)	2004-02-19

I couldn't tell you what the other books were, but this book, and its sequels, have become dear friends.  I can tell you the stories from memory (and from my heart) and I have read the paperbacks so often I've had to replace them with hardbacks just so they'll last longer.<br />James Herriott was a vet practicing in Yorkshire (England) from the end of the Depression until about 20 years ago.<br />The stories are charming, happy, glorious, tragic and tear-jerking.  It was a wonderful but brutal time to be practicing veterinary medicine.  It was before many of the surgeries we have now and Herriott was there for the introduction of antibiotics and many other medicines.  Think about it - how often have you had your cat or dog treated for infections - 60 years ago there was nothing to kill the bacteria that brought death to so many.  How impossibly hard it must have been for him to lose so many of the animals he treated, and how wonderful when he knew he saved them either for the farmers who needed their stock or the families who loved their pets.  And the people he writes about!  What characters!<br />I have pets and love to read the stories about cats and dogs and horses.  I teach medical students and use more than a few examples from these books about the PROCESS of thinking which is so essential to any practice of medicine.  His stories here and in later books about diagnosing hoof and mouth disease or husk or heatstroke or nettlerash are fascinating reading about the mind of a physician as it works while the seconds of life tick away.<br />This book is great, the series of books is great - curl up somewhere and get to know them.	2004-02-11

It doesn't take a genius to realize that the man knew what he was talking about - otherwise we wouldn't be reading his words MILLENIA after he wrote them.  I wonder if his horses felt they were lucky he was their rider - I know I feel lucky that we can still read his ideas.	2003-12-05

The story is a good one, esp. if you read it in partnership with Hoover's other book about her move to the woods, The Years of the Forest, and tells the story of how she and her husband moved to the wilds of Minnesota in middle-age and what (and who) they found there.  The Gift of the Deer introduces us to Peter, Mama, Pretty, Friendly, and all the others who live in Hoover's &quot;neighborhood&quot; deep in the North Woods.<BR>Oh - and why is it great to read in the summer?  Because her stories about the bone chilling cold of Minnesota winters are just right to balance the August heat and humidity!	2003-08-22

If the mark of a good book is that it leaves you wanting more, then that's what we have here.  Bowen's tales about the great races are very well-done.  I especially liked the older races (before my time), and the best of these was John P. Grier pushing Man O'War as no one ever had.<BR>But I wanted more - where is Forego, for example, and all those horses he caught at the wire, like Honest Pleasure and Wajima?  I guess I'll have to wait for Vol. 2!	2003-08-22

From Darwin and Newton to Harrison and Smith, these folks are just amazing - their love of what they did and their passion to solve a problem are astonishing.  And it's not (necessarily) because they were paid to pursue their ventures, but because their curiosity made them do it.<BR>Like Harrison in &quot;Longitude&quot;, Smith in &quot;The Map&quot; sets out to solve a problem.  In Smith's case it's nothing less than an entire geographical portrait of the British Isles.  Never mind that nobody has ever done this, never mind that it will take most of his life, never mind that people will scoff at him, he just went out and did it.  And in the process he created a revolution of thinking that we still use today.<BR>The book lags a bit in places as it strive to balance the story of the passion with the details of the stones and fossils, but it's a great tale.	2003-08-19

As good as Hillenbrand's book is, Seabiscuit is somewhat lost in the story of the men around him (Howard, Smith, Pollard, Woolf).  Moody's book is shorter and geared to a younger audience.  Seabiscuit the horse shines in this story more than Seabiscuit the historical phenomenon.  I read once that Moody knew about some of Pollard's secrets, like his vision problem, but he promised to keep the secrets as long as the main players were alive.  Moody also emphasizes how good a racehorse Seabiscuit was, how the blood of Man O'War ran through the veins of his grandson even if Seabiscuit didn't look the part.  Some of the newer stories talk about Seabiscuit's being lucky to win and being from the wrong side of the track, when he was actually blazingly fast (tied and broke a number of records, including in the match race with War Admiral) and had the bluest of Kentucky blood in his veins.<BR>But put the politics aside and read this wonderful story - like the old saying goes - it doesn't matter who trains them, and it doesn't really matter who rides them, and it certainly doesn't matter who owns them, in the end, a Thoroughbred will run as far and as fast as he was bred to run - and Seabiscuit ran true to his grandsire's heart.....and to his own.	2003-08-05
