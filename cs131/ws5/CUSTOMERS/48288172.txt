Unless you are so unfortunate as to be, say, a principled naturalist, you are certain to find this political satire of small men in high places to be rollicking good fun. Ev Ehrlich could have spent part of the 1990s writing for Weekend Update or The Daily Show.  Instead, he served as Under Secretary of Commerce during the Clinton administration. Whatever he nominally accomplished in his day job, however, he kept his eyes open and in this, his first novel, replicates to a T the dead-on seriousness and spaced-out wackiness of Washington political life.<br /><br />\\"Big Government\\" describes the goings on in a town where an image-maker manages the re-election campaign of a Congressman in a coma; where investigating committees create public theater, rake in cash, and subvert public action; where power isn't the ultimate aphrodisiac, it's the only aphrodisiac (especially for a young journalism graduate eager to trade clipping press articles for running a Senate campaign); where a tax credit bill that would make it uneconomic to actually use the equipment for which the credit would be given can attract serious support; and where an evangelical accountant who calls himself Colonel sells salvation through wise investment planning.<br /><br />Ehrlich has an ear for the patois of windbags. The sanctimonious stump speeches, the backroom deal-making, the moralizing and unfounded press releases, and the political strategizing set forth in \\"Big Government\\" are eerily accurate and even familiar, though stretched this way and that for comic effect.  His plot structure is almost equally good.  Characters who grab the reader's attention despite their mendacity and outsized ambitions bumble their way through one hilarious crisis after another in interacting plot threads.  In my view the only wrong turn is a Capra-esque ending that pulls the camera way back above the homes of small town America to show good men and women doing whatever it is that good men and women do, though part of that might have been driven simply by the need to draw the book to a bloody close.<br /><br />I have a theory about book-buying.  If you can purchase a five-star-rated book second-hand for a penny, or a dime, or even a dollar, you ought to do so.  I paid retail for \\"Big Business.\\"  It's that good.  Robert E.

Maitland writes: \\"By the time I came to the project it had become enormous, unwieldy, unfocused. Kubrick needed some through-line of fairy tale, of story beneath plot. He was creating a new myth and needed someone who was at home with myth and how it works. . . .  Kubrick had encountered my short stories and recognised that that is what I do. I write about the underbelly of human emotions in the framework of myth and fairy story.\\"  (Sara Maitland, \\"My Year with Stanley,\\" appearing in The Independent, available on the Internet)<br /><br />\\"Angel Maker\\" (1996) is the collection of Maitland's short stories that Kubrick must have known, the basis of her reputation as a reworker of ancient myths and fairy tales, and to that extent, they are stylish, mannered tales. Maitland has an ear for period dialogue, and she writes convincing interior monologues.<br /><br />Thus, the title story is a sequel to the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale told from the witch's point of view.  Mixing German romanticism with post-modern irony, Maitland pictures the witch as a companion-lover to the grown Gretel, a beautiful foolish woman bound to make her own choices in a world where men plainly do not matter.<br /><br />Similarly, \\"Siren Song\\" is the first-person chant of the Sirens in the eons before the arrival of Odysseus.  \\"This is what Sirens do.  We wait for the coming of strong men and by the deceptive sweetness of our voices we lure them to their doom.  We are Sirens, this is what we do.\\"  Like the Sirens of Ovid, Maitland's seductive singers were once playmates of Demeter's daughter Persephone, who was abducted to Hades where she rules as Queen six months out of the year.  In Maitland's retelling, however, Demeter never reproached them or penalized them by changing them into creatures.  Instead, destroying lustful, vicious men is simply their nature, and it is justified by the Dark One's rape of their childhood playmate and by his lust which the Sirens project, without further justification, onto all men (other than the bourgeois homebound Odysseus, of course).<br /><br />As these summaries suggest, there is more - or perhaps less - at work in \\"Angel Maker\\" than depictions of human emotions, in all their complexity.  This is because Maitland, it must be said, is a writer of women's tales.  Either gently (\\"Conquistador,\\" \\"Daphne,\\" \\"Forceps Delivery,\\" \\"The Wicked Stepmother's Lament\\") or leadenly (\\"An Edwardian Tableau,\\" \\"The Tale of the Beautiful Princess Kalito\\"), she castigates antedeluvian conceptions of women's roles and choices.  Women, in her stories, are often gay and almost always victims of insensitive, dominating men.  Sometimes they are co-opted victims.  Sometimes they are ironic victims.  Sometimes they are poetic or heroic victims.  But they are almost invariably victims.<br /><br />Thus, in \\"The Burning Times,\\" homosexual awakening and the desire for acceptance in an unfriendly world lead to death and madness.  In \\"Lullaby for My Dyke and Her Cat,\\" an author encounters a kind of writer's block attempting to tell, first by narrative and then by anecdote, why she thinks her son is turning into a cat.  The cat of her lesbian friend has just died, and the perceived metamorphosis of her child apparently illustrates the transference of her affections to her friend.<br /><br />As with the Lifetime channel on cable television, either you have an insatiable appetite for this type of fiction or you do not.  As much as I admire Maitland's craft and feminist preoccupations, and appreciated the exceptions (\\"The Tale of the Valiant Demoisselle\\" and \\"Seal-Self,\\" for example, memorably conflate sex/childbearing and death), I ultimately found most of these tales limiting and repetitious. - Robert E.

A devout Catholic with a doctorate in the classics, he writes often and intelligently about religion in America.  \\"Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words that Remade America\\" (1992), \\"Saint Augustine\\" (1999), and \\"'Negro President': Jefferson and the Slave Power\\" (2003) are among his nearly 30 books, many of which examine the political consequences of debates over religious ideas.  \\"Under God: Religion and American Politics\\" (1990) uses the 1988 presidential election -- which, after the demise of Gary Hart in a sex scandal, pitted right-wing preacher-businessman Pat Robertson and left-wing preacher-politician Jesse Jackson against tone-deaf secularist Michael Dukakis and an outwardly pious (and ultimately victorious) George H.W. Bush -- as a jumping off point to examine a wide range of issues in American intellectual and religious history, all of them more relevant now than in 1988.<br /><br />Wills's thesis in \\"Under God\\" is that the United States has always been a Protestant (and not a \\"Judeo-Christian\\") nation; that secularist politicians like Dukakis and the journalists who follow them ignore that fact at their peril; that at times much blood has been wrongly shed, but at other times much good has been done, in the name of religion in America; that religious concerns -- guilt and shame, redemption, suffering, and good works -- are nothing if not serious business; that some media-savvy evangelical Christians have an influence vastly disproportionate to their learning; and that Jefferson and Madison's \\"wall of separation\\" between church and state, prefigured in the lip service John Winthrop paid to the Church of England (while actually encouraging the separate growth of New England Congregational churches) and in Roger Williams's removal of his brand of purist Protestantism from the meddling of politicians, has paradoxically been very, very good for religion.<br /><br />There are footnotes, all right, at the end of \\"Under God,\\" but the tone is anything but scholarly.  Wills can write, and his book reads more like an integrated collection of essays than a dissertation.  Among the topics he weaves together are a re-examination of the Scopes trial of evolution vs. creationism; the impact of black millennialism on the civil rights movement in America from Lincoln to Jesse Jackson; and a re-examination of eroticism in the context the anti-intellectualism and censoriousness of religion in 19th-century America.  He cites to and explains authoritative translations of the Bible, not for divine inspiration but for historically accurate sources.<br /><br />Wills's portraits of politicians and the use they make of religious themes and vernacular are extraordinarily good.  Almost alone among public intellectuals, he has an eye for the art of the possible and the angst of religious experience.  This is a good read. -- Robert E. Olsenvery good for religion.

At the first dress rehearsal of \\"Samson and Dalila,\\" the great tenor Jon Vickers stepped over my prostrate body, opened his mouth, and began singing in full voice.  That experience of a lifetime sent me scurrying to take voice lessons, hooked me on five years spent as a singing monk/conspirator/Venetian diplomat at the edge of the stage, and eventually led to an essay recounting my experiences -- a worm's eye view of how truly beautiful music is made -- which I published in \\"The American Scholar.\\"  Through it all, my little bit of singing experience immeasurably deepened my appreciation of how difficult it is for truly accomplished professional singers to sing well.<br /><br />Renee Fleming's book \\"The Inner Voice: The Making of a Singer\\" demonstrates the same proposition with page after page of heady analysis of vocal technique, the sort of analysis that vocalists and their teachers will understand but whose complexity mere enthusiasts may only marvel at.  Ms. Fleming, once a dutiful child and straight-A student, evidently brought the same inclinations and discipline to studying and skillfully refining the production of sound through her great instrument.  Never a natural performer, uncertain in her audition technique, and plagued with a modicum of self-doubt, she developed relatively late as a world-class soprano, only as she painstakingly uncovered and resolved her weaknesses.<br /><br />She wrote this book, she says, when it became clear that she had something to say.  That turns out to be quite a lot.  \\"The Inner Voice\\" is an abbreviated biography of a loving, unaffected, decent middle-class girl from upstate New York who grew up to be a single mom with two young daughters, a couple of assistants, a publicist, a manager, couturiers donating ball gowns, a hair stylist on staff, a home in Connecticut and a second home in Paris, and a year-round performance schedule.  Ms. Fleming describes her formal education, the paths to breaking into a singing career, and how to go about learning on the job; pays homage to her mentors; reflects on master classes, the selection of repertoire, diet and \\"singing in the zone,\\" and the business (and future) of classical music (she sometimes feels, she says, like Renee Fleming, Inc., building her brand through carefully timed publicity, product endorsements, recordings, and -- one might add -- book contracts); and gives the reader a day in the life of a really nice singer performing as Violetta at the Met.<br /><br />The book is short on opera anecdotes even as it is generous with praise and brief character studies of classical music figures (Georg Solti, Leontyne Price, Joe Volpe) every opera fan will know.  Similarly, while Ms. Fleming is unusually candid in describing the uncertainties that have occasionally affected her (stage fright verging on panic attacks, self-worth issues, growing apart from and then divorcing her actor-husband), some readers -- warming to her kindness and openness -- may wonder whatever happened to her divorced parents, whether the girls now have horses of their own, and whom, if anyone, Ms. Fleming now chooses to date.  These, it appears, are facts for a future memoir.<br /><br />I read this book while listening to Ms. Fleming's live recording of \\"Manon.\\"  The recording -- all of her recordings in fact -- will have broader appeal than this chronicle of an education and set of intelligent, well written views.  \\"The Inner Voice\\" will be most appreciated by voice students and die-hard opera fans.

Following the death of his brother, in 1970, in Vietnam, Columbia senior Alex Massolini drops out of school and, attempting \\"to cut loose from the overfilled barge of [his] youth,\\" decamps Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, and the family construction company that awaits him there, for the Isle of Capri. He lands a job as secretary, mentee, and surrogate son to Rupert Grant, a Scottish literary giant forty years his senior.<br /><br />Besides Alex, Grant is attended to by his wife Vera and, more curiously, two young live-in female \\"research assistants\\" with whom Grant regularly naps.  In Victorian style, one of the assistants is dark, Italian, and physical, and the other is fair, English, and cerebral. Re-reading his dead brother's letters and the poetry of Rilke, Alex seeks to come to terms with the world he has abandoned, tries to make sense of the social relationships he encounters on Capri, and -- spurred on by literary example -- endeavors to make contact, both physical and emotional, with his true beloved.<br /><br />Henry James is the most recent American author that the fictional Grant appreciates.  Interestingly, The Apprentice Lover has a Jamesian feel (though mercifully none of the Master's phraseology). Like a character in James, Alex struggles to adapt to very different sensibilities in a setting laden with a rich and perhaps parallel history (the first-century emperor Tiberius, who may or may not have been a pederast, made Capri his home away from Rome), to understand the highly obscure motives and indirect words of his hosts, and to make the fitful passage to adulthood.  Many of the great themes of literature -- sex, death, art, truth, human connection -- swirl in this mix.  To add to the enjoyment and perhaps to leaven the mystery, Graham Greene, Gore Vidal, W.H. Auden, and a Mario Puzo knock-off even come to dinner.  Only a plot-driven reader could fail to appreciate this novel written in the form of a memoir.<br /><br />Parini, whose output as a novelist, poet, biographer, and critic is as broad as his range, is a very good writer.  His characterizations, dialogue, descriptions, and inner voice are equally satisfying.  By the end of the novel I cared enough about every character in it that, applying Greene's own standard of quality, I would love to be able to invite them all -- Greene included -- to lunch.

No more, no less.<br />Told largely through flat, deposition-style dialogue -- a narrative technique, as old as Richardson, in which characters tell a story simply by relating to each other what happened before the novel began -- the book features a heavily diagrammed (and largely implausible) plot, morally ambiguous characters, swatches of local color (here, the Mississippi Gulf Coast and Brazil), plenty of cynicism about the motives of powerful men, and a final twist that, because of the limited character development, rings false.<br />Graham Greene's standard of literary criticism was defined by a question: is there anyone in this book you'd care to invite to lunch?  I don't think so here.  Grisham aficionados may find \\"The Partner\\" to die for. For anyone else, save this talky book for a lazy day at the beach.  Robert E. Olsen	2004-01-05
US	48288172	R1J0PT2BPA4ZK8	0375411305	482522807	Shroud	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Superman	Axel Vander, the narrator of John Banville's \\"Shroud,\\" is the latest and, according to Banville, will be the last of his \\"self-hating, murderous\\" central characters, the kind that careen drunkenly through polite society.  Vander is an anti-hero with nothing going for him.  He is a liar, a thief, a charlatan, an academic in-fighter, an exploiter of women.  He is even a critic.  \\"Professor Vander,\\" mocks his Italian host, \\"holds that every text conceals a shameful secret, the hidden understains left behind by the author in his necessarily bad faith, and which it is the critic's task to nose out.  Is that not so, Axel?\\" (222-23)<br />The reviewer who seeks to parse \\"Shroud,\\" to expose the secret of its architecture, thus risks sounding painfully, ironically silly.  Here goes anyway.  Set in Turin, where Nietzsche became mad, and the Ligurian coast, where Shelley drowned, \\"Shroud\\" is a character study of Vander, a Jewish refugee who assumes the identity of a dead partisan in pre-War Belgium, rises to fame on the faculty of an American university, and at the end of his life confronts, and is confronted by, a dreamy young woman who threatens to unmask him.  Told mostly in first-person from Vander's point of view and in third-person from his accuser's, \\"Shroud\\" is a meditation on death, truth, identity and self, good and evil, social covenants, and spirit, in which Nietsche's Zoroaster, Christ's resurrection, commedia dell'arte, and a rejection of rationalism are all somehow conflated.  (Am I sounding silly yet?)<br />As a character, Vander lacks the comedic, self-deprecating charm of, say, Freddie Montgomery, the anti-hero of Banville's \\"The Book of Evidence,\\" so there is little lightness in his voyage of discovery ending in death.  (On the other hand, I suppose, neither is there much lightness in \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" to which \\"Shroud\\" self-consciously refers.)  Vander is not the sort of character Graham Greene would invite to dinner.  However, his voice is always full and multi-layered, in a nineteenth-century prose style, and the novel's minor characters - an Italian academic and his family, a former lover dying of cancer, hotel employees, and caff&egrave; patrons - are quirky and memorable.<br />Words, even words that no one else has ever heard of or used, seem to spill out of Banville's brain effortlessly, and like Faulkner or Proust he has a master's ability to connect the dots in long rolling rhythms.

Forty years ago, when I was squandering my education as a Harvard undergraduate, Bernard Bailyn was a rising star in that university's history department faculty.  His immediate predecessor as the dean of Harvard's American studies scholars had been Perry Miller, an intellectual historian who, before his death in 1963, remade the study of American colonial history with his analyses of Puritan ideas gleaned largely from sermons.  Indeed, American history and literature, on that campus at that time, was pretty much devoted to the study of big ideas, and not to the study of political, economic, or social events or movements or of artistic form.<br />Bailyn was one of a new generation of historians who sought out ship registers, merchant's accounting ledgers, estate inventories, and other quantifiable data series, previously ignored, to tell their stories of how, in the late colonial and early national periods, ordinary Americans made decisions of lasting significance.  For the next 30 years the study of American history followed Bailyn's lead. Still, Bailyn himself never fully abandoned his grounding in intellectual history.  His oeuvre, for example, includes the highly respected \\"Ideological Origins of the American Revolution\\" and a study of pamphleteering in the revolutionary period.<br />With \\"To Begin the World Anew,\\" Bailyn offers students of American history a thin book consisting of five essays reworked from speeches which he has given over several years.  The essays are surely well-written, but they break no new ground.  Readers who favor intellectual history may find them interesting enough.  Readers who favor quantitative historical analysis will find them lacking.<br />Thus, for example, taking his cue from an essay by art historian Kenneth Clark, Bailyn writes that Jefferson, Franklin, and the other American \\"founders were provincials, alive to the values of a greater world, but not, they knew, of it -- comfortable in a lesser world but aware of its limitations. . . . For many -- the ablest, best informed, and most ambitious -- the result was a degree of rootlessness, of alienation either from the higher sources of culture or from the familiar local environment. . . .  But the effect of their provincialism ran deeper than that. As their identity as a separate people took form through the Revolutionary years they came to see that their remoteness from the metropolitan world gave them a moral advantage in politics.\\" (31-34)  I enjoyed Bailyn's discussion and photographs of revolutionary era mansions and portraiture, in England and America, which he uses to illustrate this point.  For my taste, however, his concepts of \\"provincialism,\\" \\"rootlessness,\\" \\"alienation,\\" and \\"moral advantage\\" (like his concepts of \\"realism\\" and \\"idealism\\" in foreign policy) are too amorphous, and the analysis too formulaic, to much rely upon.<br />I am undoubtedly still squandering that education, but I would suggest borrowing, and not buying, this book.

This is what critic Eve Patten has to say about the novel and its author:<br />\\"Regarded as the most stylistically elaborate Irish writer of his generation, John Banville is a philosophical novelist concerned with the nature of perception, the conflict between imagination and reality, and the existential isolation of the individual. While his writing flirts with both postmodernism and magic realism, it is best understood as metafiction in the tradition of Samuel Beckett, Banville's acknowledged mentor. Like Beckett, he moves fluidly from Irish landscapes and characters to European contexts and histories, and from conventional narratives into fabulism and distortion. Relentlessly and some might argue, pretentiously allusive, his works play with both overt and hidden references to his literary idols, particularly Proust, Dostoevsky, and Nabokov. . . .<br />\\". . . The Book of Evidence (1989) consists of the prison memoir of Freddie Montgomery, on trial for the brutal murder of a female servant who interrupted his plan to steal a painting. Freddie is at once a disarming and objectionable narrator, blinded by his own ego, capable of the most intense response to the portrait he steals, but unable to empathise in any way with his human victim. At the heart of his predicament is his own existential insecurity, his perceived lack of substance: 'How shall I describe it, this sense of myself as something without weight, without moorings, a floating phantom? Other people seemed to have a density, a 'thereness', which I lacked. Among them, these big, carefree creatures, I was a child among adults.' In this fragility of identity the novel locates an ethical dilemma: if Freddie's concept of self is ultimately a fiction, then can he legitimately be held responsible for his crime? What is the nature of his guilt, defined by Freddie himself as 'a failure of imagination'? And how far can the reader trust his narration, a dubious construct fraught with implausibility, inconsistency and pride.\\" (Copyright Eve Patten, n.d., British Council website accessed May 16, 2003)<br />Why do I add \\"political fiction\\"? Because the \\"picture,\\" a master's portrait of, Freddie imagines, a successful burgher's protected wife from the era of the Dutch Republic, hangs on the wall of one of the big houses associated, in Banville's novels, with the English overlords of Ireland. Freddie's muddled crime, moreover, occurs against the backdrop of an anarchist's bombing and with much the same result. Further, every plummy accent, every civilized affectation (including even \\"Smyth,\\" the name Freddie adopts to rent his get-away car, a Humber Hawk, at once an allusion to England's fabled river and Nabokov's Humbert Humbert) is associated with England. Freddie's confused effort to claim, or possibly to reclaim, the painting, like his effort to define his missing self, is thus, on one level, Ireland's effort to reclaim something of its robbed patrimony.<br />This is a great short read.

Because the \\"picture,\\" a master's portrait of, Freddie imagines, a successful burgher's protected wife from the era of the Dutch Republic, hangs on the wall of one of the big houses associated, in Banville's novels, with the English overlords of Ireland. Freddie's muddled crime, moreover, occurs against the backdrop of an anarchist's bombing and with much the same result. Further, every plummy accent, every civilized affectation (including even \\"Smyth,\\" the name Freddie adopts to rent his get-away car, a Humber Hawk, at once an allusion to England's fabled river and Nabokov's Humbert Humbert) is associated with England. Freddie's confused effort to claim, or possibly to reclaim, the painting, like his effort to define his missing self, is thus, on one level, Ireland's effort to reclaim something of its robbed patrimony. <br />This is a great short read.

Parker, a Patricia Cornwell, a P.D. James, or any other ordinary crime novelist, would make for genre parody and little more.  But Robert Wilson, author of \\"A Small Death in Lisbon,\\" is no ordinary crime novelist.<br />Wilson has an eye for European politics, and he is a skilled political novelist.  When his gumshoe, Lisbon police detective Z&eacute; Coelho, follows the money, it winds from the collapse of Nazi Germany through Portuguese dictator Antonio Salazar's central bank; it is laundered through a front established by former SS officers and converted into political power and social prestige in post-revolutionary Portugal.  Wilson's characters are political creatures, moved and shaped by the great and violent struggle, in 20th-century Europe, between totalitarianism and social democracy.  If they are themselves violent, circumspect, or sad, it is partly because they have taken sides in that great struggle and lost.<br />Wilson's political themes give his novel heft.  His social themes give it subtlety.  To be sure, there are thugs in this novel who amply exemplify five or six of the seven cardinal sins, but in the main Wilson's characters grapple with moral dilemmas with which all can identify.  A brothel owner sacrifices personal intimacy and security in an effort to advance human rights.  A conservative publisher demands one more source before running a story that will invite the hostility of the rich and powerful.  A father agonizes over the sexual emancipation of his teen-aged daughter in a society in which women are not fully emancipated.  A lawyer's intellectualization of the truth excludes any possibility he cannot forgive.  Whether the reader is with them or against them, these are full-bodied characters whose choices and motivations are not always so clear.<br />Finally, Wilson is an excellent writer.  His prose is spare and descriptive.  His dialogue is quick-paced, insightful, true-to-life.  He knows Portugal and gives us an insider's picture of Lisbon.  His plotting is intricate, elegant, fully believable, and easy enough to follow.  If there are any loose ends in this book, they are inconsequential to the resolution.  Enjoy the ride.  Robert E.

What matters?\\"<br />Maskell, an essential outsider, has spent a lifetime using his studied charm, suppressed emotions, closeted homosexuality, and distant family connections to winnow a place for himself in the English establishment.  It matters not that his marriage is a failure, that he is estranged from his children.  Art, he concludes at one point - even the prized painting, attributed to Poussin, which has hung on his wall for 50 years - has no meaning; it simply is.  The same, in his view, might be said of existence itself.<br />This passive and unexamined life comes apart after Maskell, once an amateur intelligence operative, is publicly disgraced for having passed information of questionable value (\\"state secrets,\\" the press calls it) to wartime ally the Soviet Union (the \\"enemy\\").  Why did he do it?  Certainly not for money.  Was it for the cause of worldwide socialism?  For personal amusement?  To put on the mask of a man of action?  To avenge the underclass?  Or was it simply another form of casual duplicity, no different is substance from the duplicity of proper gentlemen who take mistresses or of friendly governments which destroy villages in order to save them?<br />Nothing is as it seems in this ambiguous, allusion-stocked, politically savvy, richly imagined life of Victor Maskell and his times.

Frederick, a rapacious sort wedded to conquest and the feudal order, takes Baudolino into his confidence and becomes his adoptive father.<br />Over the course of the next 50 years and 450 pages, Baudolino experiences, and often singlehandedly invents, the picaresque before Marco Polo, diplomacy before Macchiavelli, poetry before Petrarch and Dante, Parisian student life, romantic love, pity, religious tolerance, the imagination of the story teller, the detective story, and the Oedipus complex, to name a few. He witnesses the growth and destruction of cities (including the author's native Alessandria), partakes of mysterious Moorish hallucinogens, tags along with the Crusaders, buys, sells, and harbors fake relics like so many junk bonds, and debates the good life and neoplatonism with dorm mates and mythological creatures alike.<br />Eco, for whom symbols are the ultimate reality, is fascinated by the 12th century's preoccupation with fabricated letters attributed to Prester John, a wholly imagined Christian king of the mysterious Far East. History tells us that Pope Alexander III sent his secretary in search of Prester John. The secretary was never heard of again. In Eco's novel, the letters have their genesis with Baudolino, who drafts the first of them to buttress a diplomatic maneuver of Frederick. After the mysterious death of Frederick, Baudolino, his friends, and an enemy in captivity set out without a map but with a fake Holy Grail in search of Prester John. They manage to cross the fabled river of rocks that divides Prester John's kingdom from the West and, several years later, to return. By novel's end this figment of Baudolino's imagination has morphed into a consuming obsession.<br />Eco is always heady and often witty, but his narrative, which tells the story of Baudolino's life virtually from cradle to grave, is monotonously straight-ahead. The telling lacks the craft of a true writer of fiction. Robert E. Olsenester John's kingdom from the West and, several years later, to return.

The book ends where it began, with epicene narrator Richard Papen, alienated from his friends and family, setting out to make a place for himself in a drab modern world of the senses that Tartt sends up easily and often.  In between, aided by massive quantities of drugs and alcohol, and an immersion in the language and mind-set of the ancient Greeks, Papen bonds with a precocious group of college students long enough to tell their story.  And their story, simply put, is withdrawal from the world of the senses, incest, polyamory, Dionysian frenzy, incomprehensible violence, fear, betrayal, revenge, sacrifice, and unrequited love.<br />Book One builds from nothing to an out-of-body experience central to this mix.  Book Two dissembles from there to nothing.  And there you have it.<br />Tartt, who grew up on the edge of the Mississippi Delta, writes best when she writes with the detached eyes of Dickens, James, and Sterne.  She is less convincing portraying the complicated inner lives of her characters, who spend a great deal of time chatting each other up, taking baths, and shifting scenes and partners, without much point.  As a result, the turgid central part of her novel fails to satisfy like Faulkner or Homer or Marlowe, who worked the same material.<br />But that the comparison to those masters can even be made is enough to recommend \\"The Secret History.\\"  This is an intelligent, well-written novel by an author to be reckoned with.	2002-11-27

A few years ago, he made news when a published photograph of Professor Said hurling a stone at Israeli soldiers -- a symbolic act of Palestinian solidarity and protest, he later claimed -- caused embarrassment to his employer.  Said is a man of learning and strong views.  Unfortunately, the learning is largely absent from this attenuated book written in a convoluted style, even as the views come through all too clearly: the author despises imperialism.<br />&quot;We need a different and innovative paradigm for humanistic research,&quot; he writes (312).  Perhaps so.  Yet Said's suggested paradigm has little to do with research and even less to do with the humanities.  Nor is it particularly new or different.  Like a Victorian interpreter of Zeitgeists, he reduces literature (which, together with art and music, he calls &quot;culture&quot;) to a pale reflection of (or, more tantalizingly, &quot;counterpoint&quot; to) the perceived political wisdom of its time.  Thus, if the British pursued imperial designs on the Caribbean in the first decades of the nineteenth century, Jane Austen's fiction must either reflect or react to that spirit or, at worst, purposely ignore it, and it is the duty of the critic, Said maintains over and over, to determine which.  Such a paradigm, I believe, trivializes the study of literature and adds nothing to the study of imperialism.  One might as well research the history of baseball by its reflection in baseball cards, or the psychology of force by its reflection in action comic books.<br />For all its length, Culture and Imperialism is an unconvincing synthesis and a too cursory analysis of Austen, Conrad, Dickens, Verdi, Rushdie, and Said's other primary sources.	2002-08-18

In \\"Tinisima,\\" Poniatowska uses 1,000 pages of interviews, collected over 16 years, to imagine dialogue and interior monologues and from them to create a portrait of Tina Modotti and her times.<br />Modotti was Edward Weston's most beautiful model.  For a few years in the late 1920s, until she lost her nerve (or maybe her artistic sensibility), she was herself a photographer of note.  Later she labored in the vineyard of the Communist revolution, first in Moscow and later in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.<br />Yet if Modotti -- if, indeed, anyone -- is a fitting subject for an imagined biography, it is not because she was a larger-than-life character.  As Poniatowska tells it, throughout her brief 45 years Modotti, the daughter of poor immigrants to Northern California from Northern Italy's poorest region, held unwaveringly to anarcho-syndicalist views, empathized with the poor and the victims of war, and searched for love in all the wrong places.  So far, nothing exceptional.  What makes her life interesting, of course, was her involvement, albeit at the edges, of sea changes in photography and painting, politics, totalitarianism, and war.<br />The writing style veers from accomplished dialogue to flat narrative, with little insight to the characters' motivation, to magic views of the cosmos, to cinematic stream of consciousness, as during Tina's death scene.  This is a decent vacation read, full of local color, but you may come away from \\"Tinisima\\" wondering what justifies the superlative in the title.	2002-05-31

His \\"Weep Not, Child,\\" published in 1964, was the first novel in English to be published by an East African author.  \\"A Grain of Wheat,\\" Ngugi's postcolonial novel of political, social, sexual, and religious struggle, death, and rebirth, was published in 1967, when he had begun working, first, as a reporter and, then, as a university professor.  In December 1977, shortly before the death of Kenya's first president Jomo Kenyatta, vice president Daniel arap Moi, who would later rule Kenya with an iron hand, had Ngugi detained for a year as a political prisoner for what Moi regarded as the unsettling political message of Ngugi's popular play \\"I Will Marry When I Want\\".  With the play, Ngugi turned his attention from Kenya's emergence from British occupation to the political corruption of independent Kenya.  After his release from prison, Ngugi was unable to resume his university post.  He left Kenya in 1982 and now publishes exclusively in his native Gikuyu, because he views the structure of the English language as containing a European, and hence foreign, vision of Africa.  Ngugi is regarded as one of the leading African authors of the last half-century.<br />\\"A Grain of Wheat\\" is not realism in the Western style.  It does not set out to tell one story from one character's point of view.  It does not rely on finely drawn character development, interior monologue, dilemmas established early and worked out late, and the sort of rational choices which characters exercising free will make in Western fiction.  Rather, it is fiction in a Marxist-Homeric style with Biblical overtones, told from many points of view, and crossed, perhaps, with an African oral tradition.  In \\"A Grain of Wheat\\" birth is destiny, struggle is inevitable, the Lord disposes, and until the very end of the novel destiny is therefore imposed on each of the imperfect village characters, rolling over them, grinding them into an \\"earth smoked grey like freshly dropped cow-dung\\", reminding them of dogs tearing the limbs off a rabbit and running \\"with blood-covered pieces\\" in different directions. (215, 229)<br />Kenya, Kenya's history since the late 19th century, and Kenya's emancipation from the Brits during the 1950s is the story of \\"A Grain of Wheat,\\" and that story is told through the complex interactions of Kihika, a resistance leader; his beautiful, universally desired sister Mumbi; their friend Mugo, who wrestles with his conscience even as he is revered as a hero of the resistance; Kajanga, a quisling who becomes chief of their village and lusts after Mumbi; and Gikonyo, the husband of Mumbi, who, after seven years as a political prisoner, rejects his wife when her single flaw is exposed.

The effect, kaleidoscopically, is to create a picture of an entire society in turmoil.<br />It may be difficult for Westerners to bond with the central characters.  Their actions may sometimes seem strange.  There is no program to identify them and no roadmap for the gradually developing plot.

Overnight, she has vaulted to the first rank of contemporary Latin American novelists. \\"Yocandra in the Paradise of Nada\\" (Arcade Publishing: 1997) was her first novel published in English. \\"I Gave You All I Had\\" (Arcade Publishing: 1999), which existed in manuscript as early as 1995, and \\"My Father's Foot\\" (Planeta: 2002) have recently added to her reputation.<br />Told in the first person, \\"Yocandra\\" is a brief, rich, wrenching, serio-comic, episodic, film-influenced, belle-lettristic piece of performance art, in which the narrator's voice is, happily, always present.<br />Thrust out of a magic-realist Purgatory in a cycle of petition and rejection, Yocandra is confined to Castro's Cuba. A person's name may be important, but apparently not in Cuba. Yocandra exchanges one name, the name of her country, for the name of a muse in a failed effort to buy love. All of the other major characters in the book lack proper names. Her two lovers bear nicknames -- the Traitor and the Nihilist -- which reflect their relationship to the Cuban state. Like characters in a Bergman film, they meet and play a game of chess together while Yocandra suffers a spiritual crisis. Her father, a Communist Party hack, destroys a treasure trove of homoerotic art because it offends his orthodox machismo views. Her girlfriend, the Worm, escapes to Spain, where her life with a belching fat man becomes as strained as that of a character in an Almodovar film. Yocandra's lost love, the Lynx, stumbles upon a nighttime sailing expedition to Miami, willingly joins in, and alone survives a storm when he lashes himself to stray timber and floats free.<br />This is a Cuba in which Communist ideology and bureaucracy have bred poverty, corruption, and disconnects in the extreme. In the background of Yocandra's story, neighborhood vigilantes search excrement-strewn dumpsters for signs of political disloyalty, bicyclists who pedal to forget are branded loose women, the data entry clerk at Yocandra's literary journal creates her database anew each day when the power cuts out before she saves her work, everyone barters everything of value for what passes for food, and the sea pounds relentlessly and the sun continues hypnotically to shine.<br />Sex plays a prominent part in \\"Yocandra.\\" (Valdes has said that, growing up fatherless and without money in Cuba, she had sex instead of toys.) Devotees of erotic fiction told from a woman's perspective may appreciate the clinical description of Yocandra's lovemaking with the Nihilist, whose perfect body includes a perfectly used thirteen-inch tool. But if the scene is erotic, it is not because there is any affection, much less love, passing between the two. Sex without love -- like literature without words, pride without accomplishment, work without labor, birth without creation -- is a staple of Yocandra's daily life in Cuba.<br />This is a provocative book, written with style by an author to contend with.randed loose women, the data entry clerk at Yocandra's literary journal creates her database anew each day when the power cuts out before she saves her work, everyone barters everything of value for what passes for food, and the sea pounds relentlessly and the sun continues hypnotically to shine.<br />Sex plays a prominent part in \\"Yocandra.\\" (Valdes has said that, growing up fatherless and without money in Cuba, she had sex instead of toys.)

His personal story epitomizes the American Dream and underscores a certain political point of view about China.  Perhaps for this reason, \\"Waiting,\\" his first novel, has been overrated and over-awarded.<br />The backdrop of the novel -- the daily life of proletarians and party officials in Mao's China -- is interesting enough and sometimes amusing, but the author's development of his central characters and his narrative technique will disappoint readers used to Western fiction.  There is little of the subtlety of Checkov or Turgenev, or the expanse of Nabokov, here.<br />Physician Lin Kong and his chaste lover, nurse Manna Wu, begin and end as tentative, slight characters, virtually devoid of inner lives or major contradictions.  The so-called \\"twist\\" at the end of this book is, in reality, little more than a double dose of the tentativeness which affects Lin throughout.  To the extent Lin and Manna face dilemmas, they do so, not through actions which the reader might interpret and identify with, but rather through interior monologues of the angel-on-the-left-shoulder, devil-on the-right-shoulder variety.

How do place, class, calling, ideas, politics, and pheromones factor in their story? What is friendship anyway? These themes of Theroux also inspire Greene's \\"The End of the Affair.\\"<br />Two authors -- one established, the other just starting out -- meet in Uganda in 1966. Naipaul, the established one, is crabbed, dismissive, paranoid, needy, fussy, rule-bound, misogynistic, cheap, but immensely talented and eager to mentor. Theroux is accepting, ingratiating, adventuresome, admiring, and willing to pick up every check. Like partners in a bad marriage, they complement each other. Over the years, as friends, they support each other through the usual crises of life. As artists, they read each other's work and carry on a dialogue about writing, books, and other authors. Their shared interest in the writer's craft sustains their friendship, despite their personal differences.<br />Naipaul's wife Pat also supplies some glue. Naipaul treats her shabbily, but Pat nevertheless \\"loved him -- loved him without condition -- praised him, lived for him, delighted in his success in the most unselfish way.... Possibly there was an element of fear in it -- the fear of losing him, the fear of her own futility and her being rejected.... She was discreet. She was kind, she was generous, she was restrained and magnanimous; she was the soul of politeness, she was grateful; she was all the things Vidia was not.\\" (312) Theroux, who would acquire and lose a family of his own during the course of his relationship with Naipaul, desires Pat almost from the start. Naipaul rejects Pat's body, like a piece of undigestible sinew, in favor of prostitutes and other secret lovers. When Pat dies and Naipaul immediately remarries, his tactless new wife drives a wedge between old friends.<br />Or does she? \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" -- part memoir, part biography, part domestic drama, part psychological study, part literary criticism -- is not so clear. Perhaps Theroux, the author of 22 books, simply outgrows his sycophant's role: by book's end, in fact, dueling faxes replace dutiful lessons over lunch, and Sir Vidia's shadow shrinks literally to nothing. Perhaps there is something more, a context to the friendship that, though hinted at, goes unverbalized, thus clouding the book's focus. In fact, Theroux's portrait of Naipaul is extensive, but Naipaul is an independent -- a secretive -- man, and Theroux's portrait of himself is more limited, more guarded still.<br />Besides Graham Greene, in other words, there is something of Henry James in \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow,\\" but it is James without the information to clearly distinguish the protagonists from the victims.ctless new wife drives a wedge between old friends.<br />Or does she? \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" -- part memoir, part biography, part domestic drama, part psychological study, part literary criticism -- is not so clear.

If you enjoy Dickens, Scott, Thackeray, Melville, or Twain, for example, you'll love this novel.  If you never heard of, much less read, any of those other authors, you may still love this novel.  Yet philosophically, \\"Alias Grace\\" is thoroughly post-modern.  Experience, Atwood tells us, is compartmentalized, like the mind, like quilts; truth is whatever enables us to live life.<br />Household servant Grace Marks was captured, tried, convicted, and jailed for her part in the 1843 murder, in what is now Ontario, of her master, bachelor Thomas Kinnear.  Kinnear had been romantically involved with his housekeeper, also murdered.  That much is fact, and the historical event, with its issues of class, gender, and frontier justice, has preoccupied Atwood for decades.  She wrote a teleplay about it, which she now disavows, in the 1970s.<br />In this fictional treatment, Atwood posits a group of bourgeois reformers/mystics who seek Grace's release from prison, after many years, through the development of a more probing account of what actually happened on the day of the murders.  They engage Dr. Simon Jordan, a Harvard-educated physician and early proponent of notions of the subconscious that Charcot and Freud would later develop.  Obtaining her confidence, Jordan meets regularly with Grace, who chronologically tells her story.  Ironically, as the tale progresses, Grace -- ostensibly the docile servant, the passive patient -- becomes increasingly percipient, controlling, and heroic, while Jordan -- ostensibly the pre-Freudian analyst -- becomes increasingly clueless, controlled by his subsconscious, and comic.  At a key moment, a hypnotist (or perhaps a charlatan) intervenes, and the story takes a final, dramatic twist.<br />\\"Alias Grace\\" is satisfying on every level.  Its plot development, poetic descriptions and dream sequences, literary references, historical and intellectual backdrop, and notions about what we know and what we live for are all very, very good.scriptions and dream sequences, literary references, historical and intellectual backdrop, and notions about what we know and what we live for are all very, very good.	2002-02-04

Busch follows his character's advice: these stories are about loss -- the loss, by sympathetic, everyday people, of a parent, spouse, sibling, or child -- and yet the dimensions of their loss, sometimes even the fact of the loss itself, are only hinted at. The stories are remarkably affecting, the characters are credible and interesting, and the dialogue is right on.	2002-01-28

Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; and &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; soar with their larger than life characters, rich depictions of the Indian subcontinent, lyrical prose, and magic realism, and they tell fine stories.  &quot;Fury,&quot; by contrast, is a ruminating monologue, a screed, which wrestles darkly with American mass culture, the overclass, personas, the political pretensions of the Indian diaspora, intellectual honesty, and the dilemma of love.<br />There is narrative heat here but precious little light.  Rushdie's characters fail to engage.  His issues fail to resolve.  A tragedy worthy of the Greek Furies, who horribly punish unavenged crimes, utterly fails to develop.  Unless you happen to be writing your dissertation on Rushdie, you can safely pass on &quot;Fury.&quot;	2002-01-25

Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin overlays four tales.  Iris Griffen, who was born into old money and married into new, approaches the end of her days as an enfeebled old woman, living alone in a contemporary Canadian city, not quite able to navigate the fast lane of cheesy doughnut shops, snowy sidewalks, and unmended fences that have become her life.  She decides to put her papers in order, and in the process to record her memoirs, for the benefit of her estranged grand-daughter, who has become her only surviving relative.<br />In flashback, Iris tells the coming-of-age story, from between the wars, of her younger sister Laura and herself, and of the various men in their lives.  Iris is the older, more dutiful daughter; Laura, the rebel, the incisive one.  This second story is a rich period piece -- Atwood employs research assistants -- distinguished by many, many flashes of insight, turns of phrase, and masterly characterizations, but at bottom it is the stock in trade of historical fiction writers.  You will either delight in, for example, Atwood's wry parodies of genteel 30s journalism, her recollection of the fragrances and costumes once dispensed at upscale department stores, and the clash of ideas represented in the commissioning of public memorials, union organizing efforts, and the Spanish Civil War, or -- like the New York Times' reviewer -- you will find such realistic detail excessive, perhaps even hackneyed.<br />At her death in 1945, Laura leaves a thin manuscript, also called The Blind Assassin, which depicts the extended affair, carried out in borrowed rooms and last-chance motels, of a nameless socialite and her nameless left-wing lover.  Published posthumously, it has become a classic in women's studies circles.  Intercut excerpts from Laura's novel form the third story.<br />Finally, the two lovers spin a pulp fiction Scheherezade's tale -- a science fiction story -- about the escape of two other lovers, one blind and one mute, from the fabled city of Sakiel-Norn, soon fated to be sacked and burned.<br />The stories run in tandem.  They converge and reflect each other, and in the end play out the triumph of the writer's pen over class-and-money over love-and-justice.  As usual, Atwood's diagramming of plot lines and conflation of time lines is flawless.  Her various narrators' voices are rich and credible.  Her insights run the gamut from whimsical and detached to ironic and probing.  Sentence by sentence, book by book, Atwood is clearly one of the best fiction writers working today.<br />But is her fiction moving?  Does it alter the reader's perception of the world?  Does it pose and resolve ethical dilemmas of the sort you might expect of world masters?  In my view, no.  &quot;This wouldn't happen today,&quot; Iris often writes, and then proceeds to describe the minatory, almost melodramatic actions of some prominent, rich, white male lording it over some poor woman who, at least in &quot;those days,&quot; seems strangely powerless to defend herself.  Adding human frailty to class and gender warfare as the engines of plot development and the explanation of characters' actions adds little new.<br />The result is that Iris and Laura are interesting characters, all right, but they are never really compelling characters.  Their problems are never really our problems.  Their story is not the dilemma of being human.  In short, The Blind Assassin is great craft, but perhaps not great art.city of Sakiel-Norn, soon fated to be sacked and burned.<br />The stories run in tandem.

US	48288172	R1DV1Q0MVEY0U0	0679738711	945053348	Such a Long Journey	Books	4	11	12	N	Y	A Good Read	This interesting first novel tackles several long journeys -- India's transformation from the raj to a brawling, corrupt, mismanaged, constantly at-war democracy under Indira Gandhi; Bombay resident Gustad Noble's economic decline from a kind of family prominence and prosperity under the Brits; and, most directly, Noble's rise in understanding, breadth of spirit, friendship, and accommodation to what India has become, warts and all.<br />Readers who delight in plot development may be disappointed. There are plots and subplots of sorts in this book -- will Noble's son reject a shot at an engineering degree? will his daughter regain her health? will a former neighbor, now in New Delhi, be found out as a good guy or a bad guy? will a prized homage to spirituality survive the wrecker's ball? will the bank manager learn the truth about some misguided deposits and spill the beans? will the simpleton get the, uh, girl? -- but, to me at least, these stories appear and drift away without careful crafting or much urgency in the telling. Rather, Mistry uses his plot lines more as opportunities to describe modern Indian society, in its complexity, and Noble's passage through it.<br />Mistry's central characters are full, interesting, and idiosyncratic. His minor characters -- the politically active prostitutes, the apartment dweller practicing the black arts, the bureaucrats and politicians, the speedtalking simpleton -- are persons we have seen before. Excellent political satire sometimes veers toward cartoons. Still, sentence by sentence, Mistry writes well and with sensitivity to his characters' inner lives.<br />This is not world-class fiction, but it is a good read, especially for persons with an international bent who are not put off by detail.	2001-12-20

The New York Times Book Review called it the &quot;richest and best-accomplished single volume on Wagner in English.&quot; The late Paul Hume, himself no slouch as a musician, musicologist, and critic, called it &quot;superb.&quot;<br />In 455 dense pages, Gutman, retired as a university professor and lecturer at Bayreuth, chronicles the comings and goings of Richard Wagner's life, probes the recesses of his often messy mind and his frequently strained relationships with other artists, lovers, thinkers, political figures, and hangers on, examines the development of his ever-changing esthetic, and analyzes the novelty of his music and, more importantly, the sometimes bourgeois, sometimes frightening sentiments of his words. As a reader, it helps to have some prior familiarity with the plots of Wagner's operas and with nineteenth-century European intellectual history.<br />Gutman's central thesis is that, as a composer of music, Wagner was a genius; as a poet, he was barely literate; and as a human being, he was egomaniacal, boorish, uneducated, greedy, opinionated in the extreme, and racist. In 1968, when Gutman first advanced this thesis, Wagner was enjoying a resurgence of critical acclaim as a poet. Otherwise there is nothing to be surprised by here. The composer's problems with patrons and creditors, his voracious sexual appetites, his meretricious relationship with King Ludwig II of Bavaria, the appeal of the composer's operas to Hitler and hence to the Third Reich, his involvement in the events of 1848, and his anti-semitism have long been well known.<br />In developing his thesis, Gutman displays an encyclopedic understanding, not only of letters, libretti, Wagner's own vague scribblings (whether in support of revolution or a diet of vegetables), and other primary sources for a biography, but also of the political and intellectual context in which Wagner's life was played out. Nietzsche, Lizst, Kaiser Wilhelm, Metternich, the mistresses of the Jockey Club, Goethe, and Ulysses S. Grant march, leap, and slide effortlessly through these pages. Gutman's writing is lucid, rich, and spiced with urbane humor.<br />Thus, for example, Gutman writes that the failure of the first Bayreuth festival of 1876 apparently turned Wagner -- previously a romantic rebel and always a staunch atheist -- away from a belief in inevitable advance toward higher forms just as he was composing what he knew would be his final opera, Parsifal. The result was profoundly unchristian. &quot;Monsalvat was Wagner's paranoiac concept of a small self-contained elite group, uniquely possessed of the truth, obsessed with its 'purity,' and struggling with an outside world it held worthless. Redemption was promised the hard-pressed knights, but, obviously, the Wagnerian redeemer was not to be found among Jewish craftsmen or lepers. Not by accident did Guernemanz almost immediately remark upon Parsifal's noble, highborn appearance. He knew what signs to read. Racial heredity and strict breeding, not natural selection, formed the new mechanism of salvation. Wagnerian eugenics had come into being; in his latest writing the composer had embraced the darker implications of Darwinism.&quot;<br />This book has a well-supported point-of-view.

US	48288172	R17ANJMNVRBLTF	0871138158	706565889	The Hiding Place	Books	3	6	8	N	Y	Antipasto	I found this first novel, by a creative writing program graduate, to be readable but thin. The motivation and inner life of the principal characters are hardly developed, though that may be the author's point: Ms. Azzopardi appears to be primarily interested in the ambiguity of the central characters' separate attraction to flight and, with minor exceptions, in the numb isolation of their daughters. If so, for me, it is a low-calorie premise.<br />The author creates a pretty good sense of time and place dependent too much, for my taste, on food descriptions.  Unfortunately, her style is neither especially realistic nor magical nor lyrical nor driven by psychology. It is just there, just craftsmanlike. Life down on the docks of Cardiff, with Maltese immigrants scratching out a living, turns out to be not much different from life in, say, Hoboken in the 1950s.<br />In the category of atmospheric, family-descriptive first novels, I enjoyed The God of Small Things and The Joy Luck Club far more.	2001-11-20
