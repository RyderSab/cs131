It's certainly helped me to take control of my dog's idiosyncratic toilet habits. My pug Grendel now dances to my tune, be it on walks, in the garden or merely impressing friends and family. A word of caution - take care when choosing your \\"command words\\" and \\"smart phrases\\" to avoid words your dog is likely to hear on the television. It took 4 episodes of Ali McBeal before I realised that my \\"full evacuation\\" command was in the theme song.	2002-09-19

Quite frankly something needed to be done to resurrect the physical side of my marriage which has been blighted in the main by my PE, and Caprio's guide seemed the perfect start. As the author makes clear, lovemaking is an art - an art whose media are the body AND the mind, with the lover as artist. I have every confidence that reading this guide will lead to a happier love life for my wife me, and will help me move on from my frustratingly Pollockesque form of abstract expressionism.	2002-09-11

I refuse to go along with the naysayers who talk of a general \\"dumbing down\\" - i rather think of it in terms of a fundamental shift in the way young people think nowadays. Sure, even I might not have heard of Pascal's Wager when I was 17 like my son; but I certainly wouldn't have thought that \\"he\\" was an adult entertainer.

Thank goodness therefore for this sensitive and helpful guide to responsible parenting. Sometimes the old ways are best: when my own dad caught me smoking when I was a teenager, he sat me down at the kitchen table and I wasn't allowed to get up until I had finished the entire packet. That worked, after a fashion. I tried a similar approach with my own son Jonathan when I recently found a stash of porn videos in his room. I believe he found the 9 hour marathon viewing as uncomfortable as I did, and I have high hopes of weaning him of this filth.	2002-07-06

I tried everything: patches, gum, cold turkey - you name it, I tried it, and still I smoked like a [chimney]. But this book helped me kick the habit and beat the craving. It was 5 years ago last April that I had my last death stick and I have never felt better. No more hacking cough, no stinking of foul smoke and no more shelling out crazy money just to then literally send it up in smoke. This was the best money I have ever spent.

Though the authors deal with the problems which can sometimes affect men later in life, mainly I bought it for my wife Marjorie. With a sensitive touch the authors set out some of the physical and emotional changes which can affect a woman, and give advice on a range of options - medical, holistic and psychological - on addressing any difficulties. It's too early to say whether the book has been effective, though to be fair to Marjorie my goitre hasn't helped things. I give it 5 stars nonetheless.	2002-06-25

Yet it's not always so picturesque, warns Fleming, referring to the example of British computer-programmer \\"Justin\\", whose knowledge of sex prior to losing his virginity was solely garnered from pornography.

While there were some entertaining bits I was slightly disappointed that the author didn't make his condemnation of drugs a little clearer. Look, I'm no square, drugs are a fact of life and therefore an issue open for discussion in literature.

In Cruise's case dyslexia was the obstacle - it nearly cost him the part of the barman in \\"Cocktail\\" (he thought it was a film about cockatiels and told his agent he \\"didn't do parrots\\") and he bought his own wildebeeste to research the part of Lt Maverick Mitchell in \\"Top Gnu\\".	2002-02-11

Salads, sandwiches, cakes and treats this book has them all. My wife prepared a handsome spread using this book and I hope she will get back in the picnic-saddle again soon. Getting parts of her glasses frames embedded into her face by a stray frisbee put a dampener on our last outing to the park, but Marjorie was pleased to learn when she got back from the hospital that I thoroughly enjoyed the feast. Excellent.	2002-01-30

There's a wealth of detail on chatrooms and online dating agencies and even advice on how to progress your relationship offline (the trickiest part.) I found the tips invaluable when meeting a woman I had met online. The first date started terribly, with her taken aback by my pronounced gynecomastia, and conversation was more or less non-existent in the restaurant. But I followed the author's advice and we skipped dessert and headed on to an internet cafe and the juicy chat started flowing. First rate.	2002-01-24

My son Jonathan wants something &quot;ironic&quot;, though his suggestions owe less to irony than inappropriate buffoonery and disrespect (viz Schlong, which isn't in this book) and my daughter Stephanie mysteriously says it has to be something she can work with if she doesn't make it in mainstream films.

In addition to fascinating descriptions of filming techniques Parsons gives behind-the-scenes exclusives, and hot gossip on the personalities involved. I particularly enjoyed the details of David Attenborough's burdensome riders for location filming - his trailer was to be stocked at all times with chilled Evian, fettucine alfredo, grilled fish, 200 gardenias and a huge bowl of M&amp;Ms (no red ones). Parsons recalls how Sir David nearly stormed out of the gig when filming gorillas in the Cameroon rainforest after a runner fouled-up on the mineral water; but pro that he is, Attenborough soldiered on, making do with San Pellegrino and going on to provide the world with some of the most startling images of human interaction with these majestic primates.	2001-10-28

The authors' own personal experiences inform their scholarship and give the reader a unique view of this savage continent, and there is even a touch of adventure here and there. There is a gripping account of Margaret Thatcher's 1981 trip to Antarctica when food supplies ran perilously low; undaunted, the Iron Lady dived into the icy seas off McMurdo Sound, ignoring the 15 foot swell, to despatch a Leopard Seal with her bare hands and haul it onto the ice where she butchered it expertly and then performed an exultant dance over its dismembered remains.	2001-10-17

Slopping up this pre-primetime pap day-in-day-out was quite frankly doing my nut in and, though it may not have seemed that way, my ability to engage in on-screen anodyne banter was affected. I was in a rut. Career worries spilled out into my private life, and I wince when I think of all the drunken I-could-have-been-a-contender speeches I made to all those anonymous barflies.

What is evident in the work of Lloyd Wright, and what can certainly be seen in this magnificent retrospective, is his continual striving to incorporate innovation with consistency in order to create an architectural grammar which was, though eclectic, uniquely American. Take, for example the Larkin Building, in which the architect showed his willingness to experiment with new materials and technologies. Just as Lloyd Wright innovated with air-conditioning, plate-glass windows, integral desk furniture and suspended toilet bowls, so the Domino's Master Piemaker brings an almost symphonic unity to his work with multifaceted swathes of mushroom, cantilevered tranches of melting cheese and geometric designs hewn from pork. As David Hanks says in his helpful introduction &quot;The romantic spirit that Wright brought to all his buildings is that same unabashed virtuosity that is brought boxed and piping hot to your door (thanks to their revolutionary new HeatWave packaging system) when you phone for a delicious Domino's pizza from any one of their 6200 franchised stores worldwide&quot;.	2001-08-07

Initially I had mixed success following Carducci's tips - he advises the reader to &quot;talk about subjects which interest you&quot; yet I always felt that I was encountering a brick wall when I brought up my trophy-mounted roadkill collection. Then again, we are a nation of dog-lovers. However, I have really come into my own now I realise that by continually reminding the person I am talking to of how utterly inconsequential and boring my conversation is I can disguise myself as an ironic wit.	2001-07-29

It gives practical tips on all matters including how to go about meeting people, and what are the best approaches for different people. Not everyone's the same you see, and this book is very much geared to the individual. Being a clinically obese depressive who values honesty and who seeks a Kylie lookalike (gsoh essential) meant that lonely hearts columns were out despite their first-blush appeal.

My job brings it's share of anxieties; I am the janitor at the head office of a large foodstuffs company and have had to clean up a lot of unkind bathroom graffiti about me. It wouldn't bug me but it's just not funny, and certainly doesn't help with my ongoing problems with the assistant head of marketing, Doug, who is seeing my wife. But this book has been a Godsend which has helped me rebuild the self-esteem I thought I had lost and full marks to the authors. Doug says I've got to caddy for him next week at the executive golf trophy or I'm fired, so I'll be reading up on more of Dr Sorensen's tips on &quot;defined parameters of tollerance&quot; and buffing up my old caddying shoes.

True, pornography perhaps first demanded critical scrunity when  VHS brought it out of the ... booth in the 80s; but such a demand was, at best, muted. But when \\"Ass Rage 3\\" and \\"Natural Bone Drillers\\" (both given 5 stars in this guide) hit the shelves we witnessed an artistic reclamation which enabled the soi-disant culturally savvy elite to buff the chubster and bandy about terms like \\"Gen-X kitsch\\" and \\"post-PC irony.\\" This tremendous guide is alive to that seminal shift, and indeed provides video-still evidence of several graphic examples of it.

It was amazing to read of the complex range of behaviours and emotions you can spot simply from looking at a cat. Barry, my spaniel, and I often watch Maureen, next door's Persian as she walks across the wall at the end of my garden. We have detected disdain as she walks away from us with her tail in the air and back-eye winking, and smug pity as she eyes Barry's vain yapping from behind the French windows, but I am intrigued to learn that cats can feel pessimistic and have a rudimentary concept of the bourgeoisie and slapstick humour.	2001-06-12

It must be borne in mind that it is primarily a historical overview and not in any way a lifestyle or diet book as my wife seems to think it is. Breakfast on the hoof before a busy day at the office is impossible now that the standard breakfast table typically groans under the weight of 2 loins of mutton, 2 loins of veal, a loin of beef, a leg of mutton, a pig, a capon, a coney, one dozen pigeons, one hundred eggs, a goose, a gallon of red wine and a kilderkin of ale in the Raddick household.	2001-05-22

A vivid picture of the Hull East MP emerges: he developed a reputation for tough bargaining as a National Union of Seamen official, once famously chinning a QE2 purser for spilling his water in pay and conditions negotiations. He was known to contemporaries at Ruskin College in the late 60s for his catch-phrase &quot;You can't make an omelette with egg on your jacket&quot; and for giving the dean a good slapping for &quot;looking at me funny&quot; during his graduation ceremony. Colin Brown also sets out in a handy appendix some of the brawling techniques used by the DETR man - they make fascinating reading. A snooker ball in a sock is a handy weapon if you anticipate trouble at a cabinet meeting and a roll of pound coins held in the palm of the hand lends weight to a punch. Make no mistake, Big John is a handy man to have around when it kicks off.	2001-05-17

For cases of inadequate cardiac output resulting in a reduction of renal circulation and glomerular filtration rate or even cases of obstructive lesions between the tricuspid orifice and the aortic valve, Dr White recommends a course of smooth sweet lovin' all night long. Diagnostic techniques are exhaustively covered also: establishing whether the patient is suffering from cardiomyopathy, where there is endocardial fibrosis or constrictive endocarditis, or whether it's just a groove thang goin' on is vital for the practitioner. Dr White eschews techniques such as angiocardiography or measurement of systemic flow by means of cardiac catheterization in favour of gettin' up close and dancin' real slow, feelin' the patient's lips upon your face and whisperin' tender words of love. Unorthodox but effective and a boon to the practitioner.	2001-05-12

I have a 14 year old daughter and a 16 year old son who have definitely cottoned-on to the fact that when it comes to parenting I simply couldn't find my backside with both hands. They were threatening to take advantage of my haplessness. But I've adopted a new approach thanks to this book, and it seems to be working. Instead of bawling Stephanie out when I found a cigarette butt underneath her bedroom window, I simply told her about the recent study (which I just made up) which demonstrated how smoking gave you fat ankles. Dishonest? Maybe, but I'm almost certain she doesn't smoke any more. Similarly when Jonathan asked if he could get his nose pierced I gave wholehearted approval to the idea and suggested that it would be a great father-and-son thing for us both to get our noses done. 3 hours later, when he saw what a jerk I looked in a nose-ring he changed his mind.	2001-05-10

Don't look for quick fixes - Barry is still in denial about his drinking problem (he slops his ears in the water bowl and drinks from the toilet) but is working through other issues, some of which stem from puppyhood (here I must take the blame - I used to dress him up in a little Elizabethan doublet, hose and ruff for crying out loud).

As Hague says in his introduction, it is the dream of many homeowners to move house, but in many cases (such as his own hilariously unrealistic aim of moving to a quiet street in Whitehall) these are just pipe dreams. This book gives you excellent advice on how to make do with what you've got, such as the no-nonsense chapter &quot;Keep the Buggers Out&quot;, on how to keep unwanted bogus intruders out of your home. The style of his home-improvements is best described in the the author's own words - &quot;compassionate conservatism for the 14 pints of bitter a day man.&quot;	2001-05-10

Failure to observe local custom could, at best, render you a laughing stock, and at worse cause serious offence; remember - cultural sensitivity is both common courtesy and sound business sense.  The information contained in the book is spot on, at least for the places I have first hand experience of. Don't even think about nailing the deal in Finland unless you first spend 9 hours in a melancholic, sullen and punishing drinking binge with your host; the book even gives you the translation of &quot;You're here to drink, not to enjoy yourself&quot; in the unlikely event that your host attempts some banter. Tourists to England would also be well advised to bear in mind that over one in five of the men you will meet will be either repressed butlers or caddish rascals with an eye to world domination, and when in France, dress for business success: most anything is acceptable as long as it says about you &quot;well-groomed lothario&quot;.	2001-05-09
US	47116775	R2AP5BYZBGSDUB	1558001131	135474617	A Brief History of Time	Books	5	7	11	N	N	Tremendous	First released in 1988 this fantastic cassette settles all arguments about the musical antecedents of the All Your Bases rave phenomenon. This remastered and re-engineered classic benefits enormously from Talvin Singh's deft touch in the studio and Professor Roger Penrose's innovative remixing of several of Stephen Hawking's central equations. Old favourites such as &quot;Big Bang to Big Crunch - Singularity to Singularity&quot; are still here, but revised thinking on non-baryonic particles is reflected, in the case of the above track, with a fresh UK Garage rub surely not foreseen by the astrophysicist when he first started experimenting with Newtonian general relativity and quantum mechanics back in the day. Hawking's freestyling with Roots Manuva on provides a competent (if inevitable) concession to hip-hop - think &quot;Dusted&quot; jacked up with an almost ironic take on string theory. But the Cambridge Lucasian Professor of Mathematics is at his best when he lays down his trademark dub-saturated beats as in &quot;The Role of Weakly Interacting Cold Particles&quot; with Sons of Silence and Professor Alexander Valenkin and the Tufts University Particle Fizzix Boyz taking the 'nuff respects on the sleeve notes.	2001-05-07

It's all about motivating people to maximise the return they get from their own potential. The art is knowing how best to apply that approach to the individual employee, and John Robinson is right on the money with his advice. If Malcolm from sales fouls up I openly question his sexuality, and have even told him to drop down and give me 20 in the foyer of our building. Yet Clive from personnel reacts better to a more nurturing approach rather than my snapping a wet towel at his rear. Sales are up, the workforce is motivated and I'm a happy man.	2001-05-01

He covers the man's small but radiant poetical opus marvelously and, as the title suggests, does not shy away from dealing with the dark side of the drug-addicted genius. Coleridge's de Quinceyesque appetite for opium was problematic to say the least: it seems that the brawl with Charles Lamb in a Gottingen bierkellar in 1805 may have had less to do with a disagreement over interpretation of German Romantic aesthetics (as Dr Nattarajan suggests in her biography) and more to do with Coleridge's stash going missing. Holmes provides an intriguing insight into the context of the composition of &quot;Dejection: An Ode&quot; - by 1802 Coleridge was pimping a stable of 15 prostitutes in order to feed his habit, and was heartbroken when close friend and fellow leading-light in English Romanticism, William Wordsworth, poached 2 of his top-earning girls. At times a certain naivete of approach is evident, such as when Holmes attributes the poet's 1811 armed robbery of an alehouse in Putney to &quot;a work of epiphenomena, or particular emanations, of a singular mind of visionary genius and the development of a then completely new and 'organic' form of creativity&quot; rather than seeing the act as the cold-turkey induced stick-up it most surely was. But otherwise, this is a work of solid scholarship and penetrating insight.	2001-04-24

Determined to avoid the marriage to a rich mill  owner her father is trying to foist upon her, she engages the services of the handsome aristocratic lawyer, the Honourable Philip Langford, demanding justice for the mill workers. Sparks fly but thats the electricity, as she is swept of her feet by the hotheaded charm of the lovable rascal. Philip adopts a trial strategy little short of foolhardy when he fails to seek to amend his claim to include causes of action which post-date the issue of proceedings, but this only fans the flickering flames in Emily's heart. So too does Philip's roguish lack of attention to detail in his obviously unprepared cross-examination of the mill owner. Make no mistake, April Kihlstrom, author of The Slaphappy Surgeon and The Negligent Architect is back to her best with this Regency pageturner.	2001-04-12

Though I am not as harsh in my criticism of the book as the previous reviewer, there are obvious weaknesses in the book. The lack of a rating system is one, for sure, though there are comprehensive descriptions which will enable you to form a view of the content. Riley does have his own standards, and in terms of production quality, those standards can be ridiculously high; his concept of feminine beauty is also an intensely personal one which readers of the guide may not share.

He excels on the dueling field (felling his adversary at 20 paces in unorthodox fashion) and then cuts a dash in the court of Louis XIV, winning the heart of la contesse de Rochelle with a well-placed bolus of boiled fowl which repeats on him.

The chapter entitled &quot;Quit Stalking - Start Talking&quot; struck a particular chord with me, as I have always viewed a woman's applying for a restraining order as tantamount to a declaration of undying devotion. Obviously this book doesn't enable you to wave a magic wand and make someone love you, but it loads the dice in your favour, especially if you take into account the sound advice from the authors that &quot;water finds its own level.&quot; I no longer set my sights as high as I used to, and am involved with a wonderful woman whose clinical obesity and classic early-onset male-pattern baldness does not detract from her inner beauty.	2001-02-22

Take Churchill in May 1940 - appointed Prime Minister only weeks before, with France about to be overrun by a massive armoured thrust from Germany, the British Expeditionary Force desperately fighting to avoid being cut-off, and the risk of an aerial and naval onslaught on Britain a very real one, he faced a divided Cabinet. He rallied his supporters and opponents in the cabinet by initiating a top-secret cabinet &quot;Fight Club&quot; where he and fellow politicians bonded in the course of gruelling fist fights in an underground Whitehall gymnasium. Resolve and spirit was inculcated into the War Cabinet during these encounters - the message being &quot;no surrender&quot;. A vivid picture of Britain's finest statesman emerges: despite his age and lack of robust health Churchill impressed his colleagues, not least in a bloody bout with a physically stronger Neville Chamberlain. Churchill was battered and bruised when the former Tory Prime Minister ferociously laid into him, goaded on by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. But with Chamberlain poised to knock him out, Churchill spoke - &quot;There will be no parley or surrender. This will end only when I am lying choking on my own blood on the ground.&quot; Some say that was the moment when the war was won.	2001-02-16

Even for readers like myself, with a luxuriant coif, it was an eye-opener. I have been getting in touch with my &quot;inner coot&quot; and going through the dynamics of &quot;powerbalding&quot; even though I am not myself a slaphead. First rate.	2001-02-05

Easy to follow and well laid out, it certainly helped me through a recent trip to Germany. Apart from a minor misunderstanding with a Stuttgart hotel clerk whom I mysteriously told &quot;I am not normally flaccid&quot; in response to a routine credit card inquiry, I coped marvellously.	2001-02-02

Barry, my 12 year old spaniel, viewed my attempt to &quot;sniff-bond&quot; with him with bemused indifference, though I would not suggest a shopping mall as a place to initiate this form of relationship building.	2001-02-02

The title is a clever one dealing both with the common perception that Mr Hague is in the shadow of illustrious predecessors, not least Margaret Thatcher, and also hinting at his own political leanings. While most of the book is dedicated to the political life of William Hague, the biography also gives the reader a touching insight to the man himself, from his youthful address to the Tory party conference to the private man of today. It is a fascinating insight and the reader learns some amazing things, such as the fact that he and his wife Ffyon like to recreate the famous &quot;pottery&quot; scene from &quot;Ghost&quot; in their private moments.	2001-01-31
US	47116775	RYLWWGGJ6PL5E	0060196149	147649782	John Major: The Autobiography	Books	5	4	5	N	N	First rate	John Major comes over, rather unfairly in my view, as the Grey Man of British politics. Yet from a political point of view, though he suffers by comparison to his predecessor The Iron Lady, he has some facinating tales to tell, such as the story of a meeting with M. Mitterand which nearly ended in a fist-fight. Indeed, problems both within his own party and with the electorate at large on the question of integration into Europe do rather dominate. The book also gives us an insight into the private world of John Major, the self-made son of an impoverished circus performer who is passionate about cricket and collecting arcane memorabilia (he even put in a bid when Rasputin's pickled genitals were auctioned recently in Paris.) All in all, an excellent read.	2001-01-31

I am afraid to say that the book loses a star, though, as it overlooks the fact that around 90% of graffiti is poorly spelt invitations to ........ trysts with men who, in all probability, are not being entirely candid about their anatomy.

I have found this book an invaluable tool in learning American English as a foreign language (English English being my mother tongue).

I used to take my cues from the legends of the Tsimshian Indians of the Nass and Skeena River basins of British Columbia in the way I interacted with my spaniel Barry. Even allowing for a structural analysis of these myths, that's no way to treat a dog. This book, with its no-nonsense approach to pet-care set me straight, and I have no hesitation in recommending it to others.	2001-01-16

This meticulously researched and well-argued book explores the issues which face the nation's children. It is perhaps especially pertinent in the light of events in Seattle where world leaders failed to agree on whether Kyle's dad is, like, a real dork, or President Bush's recent pledge not to allow you to watch tv or go online until you tidy up that bedroom, and that means the closet too, young man.	2000-12-30

The author seemed to think that teenagerdom is like this sort of ten year long bummer. All the talk is about depression, abusive parents and rejection. It just didn't click with me. I thought that being a teenager is about getting loaded and making out with the chicks who come out to California looking for film careers and modelling contacts. Okay, so it isn't all great, like that time when I totalled my Jaguar, like, the day after Dad gave it to me. And my dad's like, &quot;No sense of responsibility&quot; and I'm like &quot;Hello? Does the word 'square' mean anything to you.&quot; And I had to, like, get my lawyers make him buy me a new car. I mean, talk about abusive parenting.	2000-12-30

That said, on a rather banal level I did find the book useful in plotting a journey from Walthamstow to Barnes. It's as vibrant an example of the genre as I have seen for a while, written with genuine verve, though the thematic crux of the darkness of the modern mind presented from the vantage point of one geographical location has, perhaps, one inherent strain too many.	2000-12-20

I am a hard-to-please and at times overly intellectually critical reader but this book just blew me away. Adele Parks is surely up there with the grand masters of plot and tension - Barbara Cartland, Jeffrey Archer - yet has the powerful descriptive skills of, say, Angela Rippon in \\"Captain Mark Philips - The Man and his Horses\\".
