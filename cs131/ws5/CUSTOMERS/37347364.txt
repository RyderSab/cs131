Each tale worked in its own way to captivate and satisfy --even for this \\"jaded\\" reader of horror.<br /><br />Second, I must say that I strongly disagree with the reviewer who attacked Whitley Streiber's story on the basis that it had a \\"liberal\\" slant. (What does that have to do with merit of the story???) If you don't like liberals, that's fine, but why include your opinion in a book review?)<br /><br />Anyway, I digress, as did the writer of that review.<br /><br />Finally, some of the best stories in the book are by the lesser known authors, though the superstars who were included didn't send in any \\"trunk stories\\" either.<br /><br />Recommended!	2005-10-06

Mike Dooley's \\"Infinite Possibilities\\" CD set presents a simple yet profound method for living the life of one's dreams.  The method is based on the adage \\"THOUGHTS BECOME THINGS\\".

A view that puts YOU in charge of everything that happens in your life. (What a concept!)<br /><br />Learning to feel as if you are in charge is liberating and empowering because it gives you (maybe for the first time ever) the knowledge that the POWER to live your dreams is in your own hands.<br /><br />So many subjects are covered in this program that listeners should be able to use it over and over again and gain some new insight each time.<br /><br />Recommended!	2005-09-22

(Oates has something to say about what defines horror in her Afterword.)<br /><br />But I digress, and shouldn't be quibbling about whether these stories are or are not truly horror stories.  Instead, I should be concentrating on whether or not they are entertaining.<br /><br />My answer to that is that they are beautifully written (as is most of Oates' work), and technically well-crafted. Thus, the four-star rating.<br /><br />But...entertaining? I'm sorry to say: not for this reader.<br /><br />The psychological effects of the stories, was, for me, not \\"chillng\\", but depressing.<br /><br />The characters droned, seemed hopeless, usually WERE hopeless (no discernable changes by the end of a story), and generally just plodded on, until the author abruptly ended their adventure.<br /><br />Oates is a skilled writer, but less so in crafting horror fiction  than other genres.	2005-08-24

Correct. What we DON'T want is endless worksheets, lists, and forms to fill out. (Most of which should be ordered from the author's website, she tells us.)<br /><br />I wasn't expecting a \\"quick fix\\", or maybe I was. At least one quick enough to provide me with simple, do-able daily steps, perhaps even twenty-minute tasks each day.<br /><br />Instead, I read about a system that would have had me spending WAY too much time \\"contemplating\\".<br /><br />Changing issues like \\"self-esteem\\", \\"relationships\\", etc. are part of a \\"makeover\\", but yikes! ALL the exercises/tasks are too long, and frankly, boring.	2005-03-01

Part II was a desire to know if the French REALLY have some stay-slim \\"secrets\\".<br /><br />I was delighted to find that reading Mireille Guiliano's cookbook/memoir satisfied on both counts.<br /><br />The author recounts her own early struggles with weight gain while living in the USA, and then the method used to lose the pounds when she returned to France. (She did it in a way that was gentle and totally without extreme measures of any kind.)<br /><br />Indeed, the \\"French Secret\\" for staying thin seems to be one of savoring food, and giving up diets in favor of sensible and moderate enjoyment of all good things.<br /><br />This is not a typical diet book, nor is it a typical cookbook.<br /><br />Perhaps it can best be described as being \\"food for thought\\" for those who enjoy food and wish to stay slim while eating and living well.<br /><br />Reviewer: Linda Painchaud, Park Edge Books	2004-12-30

Perhaps, But Not for Everyone...	I suppose some widowed women could afford to move to Paris and live the kind of privileged life that Gershman enjoys...then again, not everyone has the financial resources to lead such a glamourous life.<br />The above is the main difficulty I had with this otherwise amusing little book. Gershman writes as though she is telling her readers &quot;how to do it&quot;.  (&quot;It&quot; being moving to Paris and beginning a new way of life in a new cultural environment). But I think she writes for someone other than women of &quot;average&quot; financial means.<br />Ah, well! Taken for what it is (&quot;A Princess Diary&quot; as another reviewer called it), Gershman's book is informative and even humorous at times. Francophiles and armchair travelers will most likely enjoy her descriptions of things French. And a few well-heeled widows may actually be able to use her book as a &quot;how to&quot; manual.<br />For the rest of us, it is an enjoyable fantasy read.<br />Reviewer: Linda Painchaud	2004-05-24

Trump is one-of-a-kind, and whether you love him or hate him, you can gain some valuable insight on success from reading his latest book.<br />The book is not a &quot;how-to&quot; in the traditional step-by-step way. (This is the reason for the 4 stars. The title leads you to believe that the book will TELL you how to get rich.)<br />No, reading &quot;How to Get Rich&quot; is more like listening to brief personal lectures from Trump on everthing from negotiating to being true to yourself.  He &quot;talks&quot;, you listen, and hopefully, you come away with some new knowledge on what it takes to succeed.<br />The man is blunt, but he's also surprisingly FUNNY.

This does NOT make for easy reading for anyone who is a beginner to the uses of Feng Shui.<br /><br />  Now, if you don't mind reading chapter after chapter filled with phrases like &quot;Make one step every day toward the fulfillment of your Chen goal from your Dream Bagua&quot;, then you'll probably enjoy the book and get a lot out of it.<br />  As for me, the struggle to keep on wading through the new-to-me language of Feng Shui convinced me that finishing the book would be worthwhile, but starting the program would not be.<br />  I think a more mainstream use of language would have turned this book into a five-star read.<br />  However, for the reasons given above, I can only rate the book three stars.  I don't believe the average reader will even finish reading the book unless their interest in Feng Shui is VERY strong.<br />Reviewer: Linda Painchaud	2004-03-19

If you're a veteran reader of self-help books, you'll recognize most of what you read in &quot;Im Rich Beyond...&quot;.<br />The authors mix their personal story with how-to's for attaining all you desire in life.<br />Their message is, basically, this: use positive thinking (the affirmation &quot;I'm Rich Beyond my Wildest Dreams&quot; sung to a familiar tune, for example), written goals (they advise that you make lots of lists of the things you want --in 79 cent notebooks--) and Tithe.<br />The tithing part (along with those 79 cent notebooks) seem to be a particularly important part of the process.<br />Did I mention that the authors have a website where their e-books and other products are sold?<br />In any case, as I said, you won't find much new here.  But the writing isn't too bad, and, as long as you don't buy cartons of notebooks (or spend too much time at their website), you could spend your money on worse books than this one.

While reading, I got a stange sense of deja vu...<br />&quot;For one instant I stood outside of time, much the way one does in a textbook mystical experience&quot;... and I remembered when I first read the Richard Bachman books.  I remembered my youthful innocence and how I never suspected that Steven King WAS Richard Bachman.  Oh well.<br />It's different this time.  I'm much older, and I'm reviewing a Stephen King novel here.<br />Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this one very much.  The language seemed awkward and clumsy, almost as if SK was trying too hard to &quot;sound like&quot; Eleanor somebody-else.<br />The plot just didn't draw me in the way some of King's best work has. (I thought the real reason for some of the plot elements was to make way for the sequel(s).)<br />As for the setting, pick one: Haunted Hospital on the site of a Civil War Textile Mill, Pet Semetary, Haunted Hotel; they all seem interchangeable to me now, and repetitive.)<br />Of course, SK can make just about anything readable.  And he did it here, even though he didn't seem to be trying very hard.<br />Reviewer:  Linda Painchaud	2004-02-10

It took me WEEKS to plow through the repetitive chapters, which were filled with characters who seemed to be nothing more than caricatures of certain types of christians and non-christians.<br />A few chapters in, I began to see the &quot;plot behind the plot.&quot;<br />Put another way, I glimpsed the end message which was: &quot;jump aboard the evangelical bandwagon or you are going to be left behind to suffer.&quot;<br />Fiction that pushes a political agenda doesn't interest me, but I forced myself to finish reading.  Once done with this --the first in a LONG series it turned out-- I made it a point to not read any of the other novels.<br />If you're already an evangelical Christian, you'll enjoy it. Well, maybe you'll enjoy the message.  But the writing? I doubt it.<br />If you're NOT an evangelical, I hope you saw the 60 MINUTES Broadcast on Sunday, February 8, 2004.

This book is NOT a complicated or sophisticated guide to finance.<br />I agree with some other reviews here that Singletary's advice is somewhat simplistic.  Still, in my opinion, her easy, conversational writing style is what &quot;saves&quot; this book.<br />Though the 7 Money Mantras are really nothing more than common sense, how many of us can say we actully use good common sense when dealing with our money? (Especially our use of credit.)<br />It doesn't hurt to be reminded, every once in awhile, of plain and simple ways to save money, limit credit use, save for the future, and so on.<br />The author gives us those reminders and the book is a good place to START learning about handling your personal finances.<br />Reviewer: Linda Painchaud	2004-02-09

Sometimes it's hard not to believe the evidence of your own life.<br />Still, there is hope and guidance in his words.

Such was the case with this book (and the video and bodyflex bar).<br />The REAL secret to the weight loss/toning claims in this book are --guess what?--a moderate and healthy diet and EXERCISE.<br />The supposed secret, which is the body-flex &quot;aerobic breathing&quot; is just plain foolish, and may even be dangerous for anyone with asthma, or respiratory problems of any kind.<br />As someone who practices yoga breathing, the first thing I noticed was that the forceful, &quot;jerky&quot;, exhalations are totally oposite of EVERYTHING I have ever learned/read/heard about proper breathing techniques.<br />There ARE no magic bullets, I'm afraid.  But there ARE a lot of &quot;authors&quot; making money out of our hopes that there could be.	2003-07-30

(She certainly does that in her erroneously researched book.)<br />The fact that she is known as a &quot;conservative pundit&quot; should give any reader a heads-up about what they are going to be exposed to in her writing. (Sad.)<br />If Joe McCarthy is your hero, or if you want to make a fame-seeking conservative more successful, then you'll certainly enjoy this book.  (Otherwise, save your money and your time.)	2003-07-08

Well, here's a great book for anyone who already has a low opinion of women!  Everything you need is here to enforce your misogynistic beliefs!<br />I wonder if this guy interviewed his mom or grandma, or his sisters (if he has any) before writing this gibberish.  (Did his Mama screw dad out of money? Or was grandma the gal who set him on this path?)<br />Listen, just go get yourself a skin-mag and rank on women THAT way, fellas.  It's cheaper, and there are pretty pictures included.  The writing is better, too.	2003-02-20

Does anyone doubt that Chris Reeve faces his daily challenges with courage, grace, and humor?  If anyone does, and if they haven't read Reeve's first book &quot;Still Me&quot; they might want to read that earlier book right along with this one.<br />The man is an inspiration, period.

Are you getting deeper into debt and can't understand why you can't stop the downward spiral?<br />This book will help you discover the reasons why you over-indulge in spending and shopping.<br />The author uses lots of &quot;case studies&quot;, and most over-spenders are sure to recognize themselves in her examples.<br />Her plan for HOW to stop could be stronger, but you can't beat the clear, concise way she lays out the reasons behind the urges.<br />Read this along with, say, Jerrold Mundis' &quot;Get Out of Debt, Stay Out of Debt, And Live Prosperously&quot; and you'll be on the way to &quot;cured&quot;.	2002-08-08

I had a definite sense of deja vu while reading this collection of short stories from the undisputed master of the form.<br />Once upon a time, King treated his readers to genuinely spooky, thought-provoking dark tales in short form.  He seems to have returned to that era with this collection.<br />After being disappointed with his last couple of books, it was great to see his work in some of its past glory...	2002-07-23
