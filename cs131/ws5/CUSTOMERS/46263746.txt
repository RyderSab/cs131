Much as Upton Sinclair in his muckraking classics, The Jungle and King Cole, his aim is to expose ethical dilemma, and forcing us, at the point of a pen, to examine what we would rather not. In previous novels he has shone a light on injustice incipient in bio-engeneering and public schools (Sisters of Glass, A Terrible Beauty). Of his work to date, this is his most accessible novel, bearing as it does on an issue that has touched us all.  In Maggot Night he has chosen as his target a drug war never meant to be won. Here he manages to totter along the tightrope between maintaining a seamless narrative and laying out facts while seldom succumbing to the temptation to preach. At 345 pages, Maggot Night is that rare animal-a story that informs and entertains. Brimming with facts about marijuana research and laws, it is an insiders view of the drug war and how it is fought. Told from the perspectives of enforcement officers and the suspects they arrest (with compassion for both), Maggot Night is a story that will touch readers deeply, while just maybe opening minds at the same time.  The protagonist, Night Hume, an undercover INET (Interagency Narcotics Enforcement Taskforce) agent in Eugene, Oregon, has for three years lived the life of the street people in the drug culture he calls maggots (thus the title). His years undercover have cost him much-a home, a marriage, a daughter-yet, always the good soldier, he does his job. Assigned to buy from a college professor who sells to her students,  he meets Ceredwen Lawrence-a most unlikely dealer. When,  due to a misunderstanding and his own weakness, he rents a room in her home for himself and his teenage daughter, Night crosses his Rubicon. From this moment. Night, the unquestioning drug enforcement officer, is lost.   Having something now to hide himself (living with a suspect) Night must lie to his partner, to his boss, to himself. But his troubles have just begun. Ceredwen's young daughter needs chemotherapy. With an initiative legalizing marijuana on the upcoming ballot, a routine bust turns deadly. Then, less than a week later, a meth lab raid explodes into an ambush Night barely survives. Lies discovered by his partner, Night is forced to choose between his job and the life of a woman he has come to care about. With Ceredwen about to lose her home to forfeiture, her daughter refusing to again endure the rack of chemotherapy, and a cover up  protecting those who murdered his brother officers, Night is forced for the first time to question marijuana laws he has spent his life enforcing.  Soon, asking too many questions brings the men responsible for the  assassinations to him, and for the first time Night sees the other side of the equation. Simon, the government agent in charge of the cover up explains the drug war to Night this way:<br />\\"Get it yet? With drugs illegal everybody's happy. Congressmen get to save us by passing more laws and raising taxes to pay for them. Cops get laws granting admissibility of improperly seized evidence. Bureaucrats get more power. Lawyers get more business. Prison workers get job security. Cartels get higher prices. Juan in Cartagena gets a job. Police departments get millions in forfeited property. And Mr. and Mrs. America get to feel safe in their beds. Does it get any sweeter?\\"<br />It doesn't. <br />Simon's job is to make sure Night doesn't upset the apple cart. There is only one problem-with the screams of his dying  companions echoing in his head, Night is not willing to play along-however much he might want to. The plot's climax, while it will not be popular with those with faith that the world owes its present state not to human design but to chance, is guaranteed to ruin a good night's rest.   While St.John's dialogue rings true, his prose will offer Joyce Carol Oates no competition for her next literary prize. \\"Ordinary\\" is howPublishers Weekly describes his prose (Sisters of Glass), and I can do no better. While accurate enough, it is spartan. Imagery there is, and vivid, but don't look for lyricism. You won't find it. St. John's strong suit is not waxing poetic. He writes as real people speak, with  one exception-a dearth of four letter words.  As Mailer substituted \\"fug\\" for its evil  big brother in The Naked And the Dead,  profanity fills the place of obscenity here. While Mailer bowdlerized to appease the censor, at St.John's motives we can only speculate. While a curious lack (some would say shortcoming) considering the adult subject matter, it is no great fault-the mind, fecund wonder it is, colorizes without effort.  What you will find in every scene, every sequel, every word-is conflict. Pure and simple. Cut to the bone, all that remains is story, and for character driven suspense,  the technique is not all that hard to swallow. <br />Maggot Night is a story about people you will care about, laugh with, shed a tear for. But what may be the most important reason we should read it (and recommend it) is that no one who does can help but see the drug war for exactly what it is-a cynical sham.<br />  Overpriced ... for trade paper, you may want to request it at your library or pick one up used on the net, but however you get it, this story is worth your time.	2001-02-19
