The lady colonel in charge of the matter declined the request categorically.  `Only over my dead body!' she said.  Today the lady colonel is dead, and the foreign corporations are drilling at Kashagan.  No one mentions the environment anymore.\\"<BR>Kashagan is the largest oilfield in the Caspian, but it is only one of many oil fields in Kazakhstan, a nation that just a few years ago was one of the poorest and most backward regions of the U.S.S.R.<BR>On the western shore of the Caspian, a landlocked sea the size of California, lies the city of Baku, Azerbaijan,  where oil wells that have been pumping crude since the 1870's still contain billions of barrels.   Today, Koshbakht Yussifzadeh is the vice president of the national oil company.  He remains profoundly uninterested in environmental impact.<BR>Across the Caspian from Baku lies Turkmenistan.  A contest to decide which of the new Caspian states is more corrupt would be close, but Turkmenistan would be a strong contender.  Turkmenistan probably has somewhat less oil than Kazakhstan.  I write probably because test drilling here is so recent that good figures are not yet available.<BR>The consequences of pumping and burning fossil fuel: global warming and ecosystem devastation, are of negligible significance to the careers of politicians now in office.  <BR>Changing this fact would not merely require an electorate determined to halt environmental devastation.  It would require nations in which government is not responsible to an electorate to back policies to end global warming and ecosystem destruction.  National leaders have little incentive to do so.  <BR>For today's statesmen, the looming crisis is not environmental devastation.  It is the threat of rapidly rising and wildly fluctuating oil prices.   To avoid this economic threat, China, Europe, and the United States are locked in a high-stakes competition for  control of Caspian oil.  And Iran and Russia are only the most aggressive of several nations vying to profit by controlling the pipelines.<BR>The shortcoming of the Caspian is that the Caspian is landlocked.   Because it cannot be shipped directly, Caspian oil and gas can only be turned into money by pouring it through a pipeline.  But every route from the Caspian to market runs through one or more of the most politically unstable nations on earth.  Kleveman's compelling book takes us to each of those nations.<BR>You can get some idea of the scope of the problem by beginning where Kleveman does, with the simplest case: Azerbaijan, where oil has flowed for decades through a pipeline to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.<BR>For  Azerbaijan, this route has two great drawbacks.   It makes Azerbaijan dependent on its hated former colonial master, Russia.  And it runs through Chechnya.  The Azeris may feel a certain Muslim brotherhood with the Chechens, but this does not override the risk of pumping oil through an active war zone.<BR>A better route would run in a straight line from Baku to the deep-water  Mediterranean port of Ceyhan on the Turkish coast.  Unfortunately, such a pipeline would run through Armenia.  In a bitter and bloody war marked by large-scale ethnic cleansing duirng the 1990's, Christian Armenia wrested the Christian Armenian majority province of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan.  Azeris interviewed by Kleveman express eagerness to renew the \\"jihad\\" against Armenia.  Cooperation on a pipeline is out of the question.<BR>The pipeline to Ceyhan is, however, being built. It will take a wide detour through Christian Georgia and eastern Turkey, where Kurdish sentiment for independence from Turkey is strong.  This is an expensive route not merely because it is so long, but because much of the way the pipeline will be buried several meters deep to lessen the risk of sabotage.  <BR>Kleveman accurately characterizes Georgian independence as marked by \\"civil wars, political anarchy, and economic chaos.\\"  Georgians believe that their civil wars were fueled by Russia as a pretext for sending \\"peacekeeping\\" troops intended to incorporate Georgia into Russia.  Certainly, with 16,000 Russian soldiers on Georgian soil, Georgia is far from real independence.  <BR>The fledgling nation-state does get some of its own back by harboring and supplying Chechen guerillas.  Russian troops, meanwhile,  have given effective autonomy to the Muslim province of Abkhazia,  which, less than a decade ago, expressed its discontent with being part of Christian Georgia by teaming up with Chechen warlords in raids in which Georgian civilians were killed by the hundreds.<BR>Although it is not Kleveman's intention, The New Great Game is a persuasive argument that lives would be saved everywhere in the region by a series of population exchanges of the type that finally ended the Turkish massacres of Greeks, and the smaller scale Greek massacres of Turks.

Eastern Turkestan was conquered in the eighteenth century and renamed Xinjiang.  Since it had value only as a buffer, China allowed the population to continue to speak Uighur, worship as Muslims, and support themselves in simple, pastoral poverty.  <BR>Two things changed.  It was discovered that northern Xinjiang holds massive oil and gas reserves.  And the mandarins in Beijing noticed that a pipeline across Xinjiang could bring Caspian oil to Shanghai.<BR>China has moved rapidly to secure its sole Muslim province with the same methods that it is using in Tibet, methods honed in the earlier takeovers of Hunan, Sichuan, and most of the rest of what we think of as China proper.  Unlike western imperialists, who have often left ethnic identities intact, the Chinese method is to move huge numbers of Han Chinese into the conquered territory.  Resettle natives in ways that disrupt community.  Reserve the best land and jobs for Han Chinese, while at the same time markedly improving the standards of living, educational, and economic opportunities of the natives.  Then wait.  Almost no one dies in the Chinese method of ethnic cleansing, but it does effectively terminate entire cultures.  In a few generations, the culture and identity of the Muslim Uighurs will fade into history, like the cultures of over 50 other ethnic minority groups that linger at the margins of Chinese provinces where their ancestors flourished.  Meanwhile, Uighur and perhaps Caspian oil will flow to the Chinese heartland.<BR>Kleveman's book is a splendid introduction not only to the nations of the region, but to the politics of Caspian oil, but it is not always a reliable guide.  Kleveman's profound, almost visceral distrust of American power regularly leads him to misstate fact.  <BR>Kleveman writes, for example, of an \\"Iran Air passenger plane shot down for no apparent reason by the American battleship U.S.S. Vincennes in 1987.\\"   Actually, while the incident was indeed a tragedy, there was a reason.  <BR>The Vincennes was in the Persian Gulf because of reports that Iran was positioning Chinese-made Silkworm missles near the Strait of Hormuz in a bid to control to control oil supplies.   On the morning of July 3, one of Vincennes's helicopters was fired on by three Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes returned fire.  Five minutes later, the Vincennes detected an aircraft taking off from the civilian-military Bandar Abbas airport. The ship radioed seven warnings to the plane, which apparently went unanswered.  The ship's log shows that the Vincennes identified the plane as an F-14 approaching at an altitude of about 7,000 feet and descending.   <BR>The New Great Game is both a great read and an eye-opening introduction to the realpolitik of oil.  It is weakened only by Kelveman's failure to perceive that Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia, and several other nations are at least as willing as is the United States to lie, cheat, steal, and kill in the competition for oil.	2003-12-04

Do not, however, assume from this that it is in any sense objective or that it examines the Middle East from all sides.  This is a book in which Jewish, Christian and Muslim critics of Israel all have a chance to write about everything that they see as being wrong with Israel.  No one who has been following the Middle East is in any danger of learning anything new.   Those who are new to the issue are, however, likely to be puzzled by the divergence between the picture presented here and reality as we know it.  <br />It is, after all, in the territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority that editors of opposition newspapers are kneecapped, their printing presses smashed.  It is in the PA-controlled territories that people are are tried and sentenced without benefit of counsel and that individuals suspected of sympathy with Israel are routinely murdered by vigilante gangs.  It is in Palestinian schools that children are taught to become suicide bombers.  And Palestinian television that broadcasts racist canards about Jews.  <br />Meanwhile it is in Israel that Muslims vote and elect representatives to Parliament.  In Israel that Muslim women are equal to Muslim men before the courts.<br />In Israel there is a free press, an independent judiciary, and a school system that makes real efforts to teach tolerance.<br />That said, Israel is no more perfect thatn any other country.  If you want to see all of the warts, this is your book.<br />Do be careful, however, about accepting the facts as presented.

Such a book would, of course, be grossly unfair, but it would be no more unfair than &quot;Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel&quot; by Norton Mezvinsky and Israel Shakak.<br />Mezvinsky is professor of history at Central Connecticut State College. He teaches the lone course offered by Central Connecticut in Jewish history, as well as two courses on contemporary Middle Eastern politics. Shahak is deceased. <br />Mezvinsky claims that his focuses in this book on Jewish fundamentalists, is because they threaten to take power in Israel as Islamic Fundamentalists did in Iran. This should concern Americans, he says, because Israel is &quot;a powerful state... that wields great influence in the United States.&quot; The threat that fundamentalists pose to Israeli democracy is similar in Mezvinsky's view, to our domestic situation in which &quot;Christian fundamentalism (is) a real threat to democracy in the United States.&quot;<br />It escapes Mezvinsky that Jewish and Christian fundamentalists, unlike Islamists, are peaceful groups and are but tiny fractions of the populations they live in while Islamists in many places are a large and growing segments of theirs. The truth is that in the United States as well as Israel, fundamentalists who espouse replacing democracy with theocracy constitute only a tiny voiceless fringe and bear no resemblance to the looming menace portrayed in &quot;Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel.&quot;<br />In Mezvinsky's view, the threat posed by observant Jews goes beyond their impending destruction of democracy, because he holds that Judaism is an evil faith. Judaism, a religion of racism &quot;comparable to the worst form of anti-Semitism&quot; has produced adherents so immoral that they believe &quot;the blood of non-Jews has no intrinsic value.&quot; he says blithely. Furthermore, &quot;Jews killing non-Jews does not constitute murder according to the Jewish religion and the killing of innocent Arabs for reasons of revenge is a Jewish virtue.&quot; This is the stuff that makes this book dangerous and is comparable to much of the anti-semitic stuff coming out of the Middle East media today.<br />If his portrayal of Judaism does not sound like the Jewish religion that you know, Mezvinsky has an explanation. Rabbis and scholars have been keeping the truth from us. They are &quot;supreme hypocrites&quot; who have hidden from other Jews &quot;The actual fact that the cabbalistic texts, as opposed to talmudic literature, emphasize salvation only for Jews.&quot;<br />Mezvinsky, of course, misses two important points. The first is that the Kabbalah, like the Talmud, is not a single book but a veritable ocean of scholarship and commentary. In such an ocean, it is possible to find a quotation to prove almost any point, although even Mezvinsky has to admit that the evil he sought is not in the Talmud, but only in the Kabbalah. <br />The second point is that the Kabbalah, that vast sea of mystical lore and wisdom, is not normative Judaism. Kabbalah is for Jews an option and an acquired taste, like Sephardi music or Ashkenazi cooking. It is also, of course, a complex if chaotic body of thought that by no fair interpretation deserves Mezvinsky's epithet of &quot;Jewish Nazism.&quot;<br />Beyond the malicious absurdity of its premise, Mezvinsky's work is riddled with undocumented slurs and falsehoods presented as fact. <br />* &quot;No Orthodox rabbi&quot; has criticized the posthumous glorification of Baruch Goldstein.<br />* &quot;The Israeli government induced Jewish immigration from Iraq by bribing the government of Iraq to stripmost Iraqi Jews of their citizenship and to confiscate their property.&quot;<br />* &quot;Before the advent of the modern state, Jewish communities were mostly ruled by rabbis who employed arbitrary and cruel methods as bad as those employed by totalitarian regimes.&quot;<br />In Norton Mezvinsky, the state of Connecticut is paying the salary of a professor of Jewish history who has a limited understanding of that history and substitutes his bias for knowledge. Moreover, Mezvinsky is a professor of history who is unacquainted with &quot;the arbitrary and cruel methods&quot; employed by totalitarian regimes around the world, but that doesn't stop him from ascribing them to the subject he knows so little about. <br />Diana Muir is the winner of the 2001 Massachusetts Book Award, and a professional book reviewer for the Boston Globe and the Christian Science Monitor.<br />This review was published in the Connecticut Jewish Ledger in 2002.	2003-10-29

Would it deal a serious blow to your sense of self-worth to discover that those first comers took a boat and dug clams, instead?  <BR> Brace yourself, a corps of archaeologists armed with spades and obsidian spear-points is preparing to overturn the received wisdom regarding the peopling of the Americas.  And they're facing stiff opposition.<BR> In Lost World, journalist Tom Koppel gives us not merely good reporting on field archaeology in action, but a blow-by-blow account of a major scholarly battle in full spate.  I like a good fight as much as anyone, and when it comes to landing knock-out punches, Mike Tyson has nothing on Koppel's account of an archaeologist dealing a near-fatal blow to another archaeologist by calling his dating methods careless.<BR>The archaeological record in the Americas begins with a scattering of  stone spear tips known as Clovis points.   These distinctive artifacts have been found from the Atlantic to the Pacific in such numbers that you can easily see one in a nearby museum.  Even a brief inspection separates the distinctively fluted Clovis points from the arrowheads in the  display case; their distinctiveness establishes that all Clovis points were made by a single, big-game hunting culture.    The charcoal and bones found with them prove that Clovis culture was spread rapidly across North America from 12,800 and 13,200 years ago by hunters who used stone-tipped spears to kill long-extinct animals like giant buffalo and mastodon..<BR>The great question is did the Clovis walk over the land bridge?  Or did they evolve form  an earlier Amerindian culture, possibly from a population that moved along the Pacific coast in canoes? <BR>Koppel,a strong partisan of the canoes-along-the-coast theory, lays into the \\"stubborn, hidebound\\" academic proponents of the walked-over-the-land-bridge hypothesis with the vigor of a hungry Paleo-Indian attacking a wooly mammoth..   <BR>The advantage of the coastal migration theory is that it makes sense.  Life along the littoral is easy.  Oysters, after all, just lie there waiting for someone to eat them, and even an animal as large as a sea lion makes easy prey when it hauls out on a beach.  When the coasts of  Alaska and British Columbia got overpopulated, it would have been the easiest thing in the world to climb into a canoe and move on to an empty beach along Puget Sound, or San Francisco Bay, and so on right down to the tip of  South America.<BR>Well and good.  But the question that troubles those \\"stubborn, hidebound\\" academics is that despite the compelling logic of the coastal migration theory, its proponents have turned up very little in the way of evidence.  <BR>To argue that  the first Americans followed the coastal route, is to assume that people lived at the shore for some period of time before developing the Clovis hunting technology and moving inland.  Yet not only have no  human bones older than Clovis have ever been found in the Americas, there are only two archaeological sites  believed to pre-date Clovis: Monte Verde in Chile and Meadowcroft in Pennsylvania.  But most archaeologists have serious doubts about Meadowcroft.      <BR>Sites this old sites are not rare in the rest of the world.  Australia alone has about 200 well-dated sites older than Clovis.  <BR>In recent years, archaeologists intrigued by the coastal theory have headed for the rainswept northwest coast to reconstruct pre-history, piece by soggy piece.  Heaton follows archaeologist Tim Heaton deep into a narrow cave on an island off the coast of British Columbia, as Heaton reaches under a rocky ledge, \\"digging in soupy sentiments, working mainly by feel.  Suddenly, nudged by his trowel,a long, narrow piece of bone flipped into view.\\"  The oldest human bone yet found on the Pacific coast.<BR>It turns out to be not quite old enough.  Yet I finished the book excited by the prospect that this summer or next, an archaeologist on an island off Vancouver will reach into a layer of damp sediment to pull out the definitive piece of evidence.<BR>Diana Muir is the author of \\"Bullough's Pond\\"	2003-06-26

Under this heavy blanket of uniformity,<BR>however, the remnants of colonized, extinguished nations, crushed and<BR>dispossessed by imperialism, survive in pain and anguish. These peoples -<BR>Kurds, Alawites, Copts, Jews, and others - have withstood jihad, genocides,<BR>persecutions, and continual sociopolitical repression. Yet their hearts<BR>still beat, inspired by the hope of freedom and survival. <BR>It is their history that Mordechai Nisan tells, combining clear scholarship<BR>with a perspicacious sensibility. Who are these peoples? In his subtle<BR>analysis, Nisan demonstrates that they represent diverse ethnic groups, with<BR>unique historical experiences. The author constructs a fascinating mosaic of<BR>peoples, beliefs, and intertwined histories. This work expands upon a 1991<BR>study, with much new material. <BR>Nisan begins by specifying the characteristics these people share in their<BR>diversity. What inner forces of cohesion shaped their resistance to the Arab<BR>and Islamic onslaught on their lands and civilizations from East Persia to<BR>North Africa? The factors promoting survival are neither fixed nor stable.<BR>Throughout the political dynamism of historical events, each of these<BR>peoples has preserved a collective self-consciousness that spans millennia.<BR>\\"The crux of a minority struggle,\\" writes Nisan, \\"often revolved around the<BR>ability to define identity from within as a matter of group<BR>self-articulation, and not be the victims of a superimposed identity from<BR>without.\\" Crushed by cultural and religious Arab-Islamic imperialism, the<BR>group's identity and cohesion is a testimony to its indigenous uniqueness.<BR>But can this human and cultural diversity of the Middle East survive after<BR>millennia of hardship, unforeseen challenges, and resistance?<BR>One discovers, for instance, beneath the uniformity of Arabism a<BR>substructure of living, resistant, minority peoples cultivating their<BR>pre-Arab and pre-Islamic native languages, cultures, and religions. Nisan<BR>organizes the groups into four main categories: (1) the Islamized peoples<BR>who resisted Arab/Muslim colonialism and kept their own culture and<BR>languages, like the Kurds (Iraq, Syria, Iran, Turkey), the Berbers (Algeria,<BR>Tunisia, Morocco), and the Baluch (Pakistan); (2) the heterodox Muslim<BR>minorities who were Arabized but resisted Islamization by keeping their<BR>ancestral beliefs and customs under a Muslim veneer, like the Druzes<BR>(Levant) and the Alawites (Syria); (3) the Christian minorities: Armenians,<BR>Assyrians, Copts, Maronites, and Sudanese; and (4) the Jews, the only<BR>minority who succeeded in liberating a part of their historical land from<BR>Arab-Islamic imperialism.<BR>Nisan describes the rich history of each group and the inevitable tensions<BR>that accompany cultural, linguistic, and religious resistance to<BR>Islamization. Their histories include the difficulties entailed in<BR>maintaining the history and culture of the group, the processes of survival<BR>they adopted, the modalities of adaptation, and the compromises employed to<BR>save a modicum of freedom without disappearing. This analytical survey<BR>carries us through several levels of understanding, from the policy of<BR>conquest and domination that included spoliation, slavery, deportation, and<BR>genocide to the various mechanisms of survival adopted by each crushed,<BR>humiliated, oppressed, or tolerated community. Not every group developed the<BR>same self-consciousness of its history, culture, and ethnic characteristics,<BR>but all resisted. <BR>The political and social tensions highlighted by Nisan are most urgent and<BR>topical for the West. In our age of multiculturalism, which has seen the<BR>recent development in the West of large immigrant communities, what does<BR>integration mean? Can some groups integrate more easily than others? Can<BR>integration succeed when fundamental values clash? Nisan's sober and<BR>scholarly analysis of the conflict between territorial ethnicity and<BR>religious imperialism is of great relevance to the West.<BR>In history, chance is a fugitive fairy that rarely passes twice. The light<BR>of freedom sparkled for the oppressed Christian minorities in the Middle<BR>East after World War I. It was quickly extinguished by France and Britain in<BR>their eagerness to appease Muslim hostility in their Arab colonial<BR>dominions. Sacrificed were the legitimate aspirations of the Armenians,<BR>Kurds, Assyrians, and Copts.<BR>Their ancestral homelands were arbitrarily lumped into enormous Arab-Islamic<BR>entities, while concessions to Islamic demands violated their rights. Some,<BR>like the Armenians, Assyrians, and Jacobites, were simply abandoned to<BR>bloody reprisals, while the promises they had been given were broken. Only<BR>the Maronites and the Jews were given a chance; even for these, it was a<BR>delusion and a snare. British pro-Arab policy in the 1930s in Palestine, the<br />gestation of the Shoah in Europe, and the closure of all routes of escape<BR>for the Jews at the Evian Conference in 1938 seemed to have delivered the<BR>last blow to the Zionist dream of national liberation. The Maronites had to<BR>wait a generation to experience the bitterness of world abandonment and the<BR>betrayal of their friends. Hence, among all the dhimmi peoples, only Israel<BR>survived the lethal Euro-Arab alliance against the indigenous Middle Eastern<BR>minorities.<BR>This history of blood, hope, and massacres that Nisan recalls in a masterly<BR>way is not over. The martyrdom perpetrated on the Lebanese Christians by the<BR>Palestinians and their Muslim allies, generalized jihad, the slavery and<BR>butchery inflicted on the rebellious non-Muslim Sudanese populations, the<BR>oppression of the Copts and the Assyrians, the massacres of the Kurds, the<BR>negation ofthe Berber's cultural rights, the jihad Intifada against Israel<BR>- all are ignored or explained away by European governments and the media.<BR>Do these ancient and courageous peoples still have a chance to deliver<BR>themselves from the shackle of dhimmitude, and the manipulations of Eurabia<BR><[...]>? Now that a new Middle East is<BR>being projected, in spite of old Europe's lethal alliance with the most<BR>repressive regimes, maybe the good-luck fairy will pass a second time, to<BR>console and redress the cynical injustice inflicted on vulnerable and<BR>martyred peoples. Nisan's book is invaluable for a fuller understanding of<BR>Middle East history, past and present. <BR>In the mid 19th century, the French Turcophile writer Abdolonyme Ubicini<BR>(translation from The Decline of Eastern Christianity<BR></redirect/amazon.asp?j=0838636780>) described the subjected dhimmis of the<BR>Ottoman Empire - Christians and Jews - awaiting liberation despite centuries<BR>of oppression:<BR>    The history of enslaved peoples is the same everywhere, or rather,<BR>they have no history. The years, the centuries pass without bringing any<BR>change to their situation. Generations come and go in silence. One might<BR>think they are afraid to awaken their masters, asleep alongside them.<BR>However, if you examine them closely you discover that this immobility is<BR>only superficial.

Freedman  in Moment Magazine<br />The settlement of Israelis on the West Bank, with all of its idealism and bloodshed, all of its messianism and domination, is in many ways the story of Hebron. It was there that an Arab pogrom in 1929 ended centuries of Jewish presence. It was there, in the aftermath of the Six Day War, that the celebrants of a Passover seder declared their return. It was there, and in neighboring Kiryat Arba, that the most controversial figures made their homesRabbi Moshe Levinger, one of the founders of Gush Emunim; Meir Kahane, exponent of Arab expulsion; Baruch Goldstein, the beloved doctor turned mass murderer at the Machpelah.<br />Against such a backdrop, one reads June Leavitts Storm of Terror not simply as a first-person account of death, fear, and resilience amid the Al-Aqsa Intifada, but more broadly as an intimate portrait of daily life among the believers. Although she is a professional journalist, Leavitt consciously identifies herself in the books subtitle as a mother. Indeed, this book achieves its most intense and revealing moments because she resolutely stays with the daily details. At the same time, however, this slender volume comes with the shortcomings endemic to publishing a diary.<br />In much of Israel, to say nothing of an often-hateful outside world, the settlers of Hebron and Kiryat Arba stand as pariahs, fanatics who obstructed peace when it seemed imminent and who stretch the army dangerously thin to defend them in wartime. The greatest accomplishment of Storm of Terror, then, comes in Leavitts ability to defy or at least muddy the harsh clarity of such stereotyping. She herself is as much a creation of 60s counterculture as of Greater Israel ideology, a woman who reads tarot cards, does yoga, met her future husband on a hiking trail in Vermont, and, yes, considers Judea and Samaria to be Jewish property by divine covenant.<br />Fascinating fault lines run through her household, as well. Two of Leavitts sons help build an illegal settlement to mark the spot where a friend was ambushed and slain by Palestinians. One of her daughters, Miriam, is ultraorthodox and fanatically right wing, while another, Estie, is a land-for-peace liberal with a pierced navel. At several searing moments in the book, the two daughters find themselves on opposite sides of violent confrontationsEstie with her army unit, Miriam with protesting settlers. Leavitts husband has veered over the years from deep involvement with the Moledet Party, which favored ousting Arabs from the West Bank, to meeting with Palestinian Authority leaders to plan for Hebron and Kiryat Arba to remain Jewish communities within an independent Palestine. How unexpectedly poignant is that moment of long-lost possibility.<br />In ways Leavitt probably never intended, though, her book displays the settler psyche. By her telling, for instance, the Oslo accords ruined the companionable relations between the Hebron areas Arabs and Jews, as if Palestinian nationalism had not been a roiling force for decades by then. She approvingly quotes an Arab telling a Jewish settler, We would have been your serfs  but what did you do? You said this land was ours  Why couldnt you understand the Arab mentality? We admire fierceness and strength! We see goodwill as weakness.<br />By its very nature, a diary freezes each such encounter in its moment. This immediacy brings Storm of Terror the documentary impact of a snapshot; the book recounts events as recent as the suicide bombing in Netanya last Passover. But a published diaryanyonesby definition deprives the author and the reader of a more considered, more self-consciously crafted, version of reality. And, precisely because Storm of Terror affords such an unanticipated window into the settler experience by such an idiosyncratic narrator, one hopes that next time June Leavitt will use her diary as the raw material, not the finished product.<br />Samuel G.

The islands' lower slopes and some of the smaller islets are a weird moonscape of ancient lava flows devoid of fresh water. Uphill, however, are permanent water sources and soil capable of supporting orange, papaya, and coconut trees, to say nothing of herds of cattle. <br />Despite these lush conditions, no community had attempted to live on the Galápagos until the publication in Germany in 1923 of a travel book called \\"Galápagos: World's End\\" that described the islands as a tropical paradise. A few eccentrics came to see for themselves. They have been coming ever since.<BR> <BR>Michael D'Orso went to the Galápagos in 1999 to chronicle the unusual native fauna. Not the huge iguanas that dive into the surf to feed, the finches that obligingly speciate while ornithologists watch, or the vast colonies of blue-footed boobies. The animals that fascinate D'Orso are the more eccentric members of species of homo sapiens, a type in which the Galápagos abound.<br />Take the charmingly corrupt mayor, leader of the 20,000 mostly impoverished Ecuadorians who stretch the ecosystem of the archipelago well beyond its capacity. Mayor Sevilla is only 41, but he grew up on the islands before the advent of automobiles and electricity.<br />\\"We ate a lot of tortoises,\\" D'Orso quotes him saying. \\"It was free meat, just roaming around. We didn't understand why people would want to protect the animals when God gave us the animals to eat. Even to this day, I feel this way.\\" Which explains why the mayor lets poachers out of jail as fast as National Park Rangers arrest them.<br />Or take Godfrey Merlen, who stumbled onto the islands in 1970 as an aimless youth working as crew on a rich man's yacht. He stayed, hung around the research station, made himself useful to field scientists, and has become a well-published,highly respected biologist in his own right without ever leaving the islands or taking an advanced degree.<br />D'Orso keeps trying to drag his attention back to the project that brought him here: to write about the more colorful of the gringo inhabitants - the beachcombers, con artists, and barefoot philosophers. But instead, his attention keeps drifting to the real story of these islands in the 21st century. The world's educated elite prizes the Galápagos for their dramatic and unique biology. But they belong to one of the poorest, most overpopulated, and corrupt nations on earth.<br />\\"Banana republic\\" is an insufficiently scornful term to describe a political system that not long ago saw three presidencies within an hour. The trouble with Ecuador is nothing new in the world: A small number of very wealthy families manage the country for private profit.<br />These families allow the National Park to exist, but do not, for example, allow the rangers to stop commercial fishing in park waters. The boats take everything: tuna, sea cucumbers, coral, shark fins. (Not the whole shark. They cut the fins off and throw the creatures back to die. Fins fetch astonishing prices in China where shark fin soup is a traditional wedding-banquet delicacy.)<br />D'Orso's casually powerful storytelling draws us in to the grotesquely unequal struggle between a unique and fragile ecosystem and the humans bent on getting rich fast.<br />Not that the environment pays all of the costs. On the outer islands, beyond the reach of law, and far beyond the reach of any kind of medical care, hundreds of desperately poor men dive for sea cucumbers using antiquated, badly maintained scuba gear. No one records how many die every year. No one records the tonnage of sea cucumbers shipped illegally to China, which are bought by men foolish enough to believe that sea cucumbers are an aphrodisiac.<br />Nor is there indication that anyone with power in Ecuador cares, certainly not the legislator who represents the Islands in the national congress. The flat roof of her house is covered with illegally harvested sea cucumbers, curing in the sun. Part travelogue, part history, and part sociological study, D'Orso's story should help shed light on these exotic islands of corruption.<br />Diana Muir is the author of Bullough's Pond	2003-02-02

The characters and currents responsible for triggering the war on terror are as dedicated as they were a year ago, but the more likely battleground for years to come will be next door - in Pakistan, where much of the problem began. <br />That is one of the most important theses colorfully presented by Mary Anne Weaver in \\"Pakistan: In the Shadow of Jihad and Afghanistan.\\" Drawing on 20 years of reporting excursions in Pakistan and Afghanistan for The New Yorker and other publications, Weaver leads us on an illuminating journey that spans lawless tribal territory and presidential palaces alike. What we see when we look through her lens is a Pakistan more deeply troubled, more closely tied to the Taliban, and more rife with anti-American sentiment than anyone would like to admit.<br />But lest we let ourselves believe that this is all Pakistan's fault, Weaver fleshes out a historical footnote to Al Qaeda that Washington would just as soon forget. Osama bin Laden and friends attracted Islamic militants from around the world and gave them training in Afghanistan with America's help during the cold war. One of \\"the most startling ironies of today's militant Islamist movement, not just in Pakistan but across the Muslim world,\\" she points out, \\"is that the great majority of its leaders were funded, armed, and trained - with the same enthusiasm with which they [are] now being pursued - by the United States.\\"<br />Of all the rogues who benefited from Washington's patronage, Weaver says that the one who fared best was Gulbadin Hekmatyar, today considered perhaps the greatest threat to the transitional Afghan government led by Hamid Karzai. During the jihad years, Hekmatyar \\"received roughly 50 percent of the CIA's arms,\\" Weaver writes, be- cause he was the darling of the ISI - Pakistan's intelligence agency - and the man who ruled Pakistan from the day he seized power in a military coup in 1977 until his mysterious death in a 1988 plane crash: Zia ul-Haq.<br />For readers to whom Zia is a familiar name and for those to whom it is not, Weaver provides a revealing profile of the man who changed the face of Pakistan, and tells us why we should care. It was Zia who claimed to be resurrecting the unrealized dreams of founding father Mohammed Ali Jinnah by \\"Islamicizing\\" Pakistan and encouraging the growth of all-Islam, all-the-time education in the madrassahs. He wanted all of Pakistan's laws to conform to the Koran, even if many penalties would not be enforced. And he prioritized the development of Pakistan's then-nascent nuclear weapons program.<br />In this, Weaver also helps us understand why Pakistan's fate is so tied up, for better or worse, with Afghanistan's. Zia - as well as Zulfikar Ali Bhutto before him and every leader of Pakistan - lives in fear that ethnic Pashtuns throughout northwestern Afghanistan will take up arms and demand their own separate country, a so-called united Pashtunistan.<br />Some 30 years ago, when Pashtun leader Sardar Mohammed Daoud called on Pashtuns in Pakistan to join up with their brothers in Afghanistan, Bhutto invited about 5,000 fundamentalist Afghan Pashtuns to come to Pakistan. Bhutto armed and trained them, and sent them back to fight against Daoud in Afghanistan. \\"Six years before the Soviets invaded Afghanistan,\\" Weaver writes, \\"the mujahideen had been born.\\" There is also a strong argument to be made, Weaver later shows, that Zia, the CIA, and the ISI turned what would have been a nationalist struggle into a holy war. The same can be said of Kashmir today.<br />\\"Pakistan\\" is full of similarly surprising analysis that make even regular watchers of Central and South Asia want to consider things in a different light. Some of the information Weaver chooses in forming her narrative is perhaps common knowledge among people familiar with the region, but she fits the pieces together in a way that makes the greater puzzle far more thought-provoking and comprehensive.<br />Weaver also offers her readers exclusive glimpses into the enigmatic life of Benazir Bhutto, and interesting vignettes from the special relationship Pakistan has developed with Saudi Arabia. Weaver describes in droll detail how members of the royal family and elites from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Dubai, and Bahrain arrive in Pakistan each winter to hunt the houbara bustard, an endangered desert bird, with falcons. The sheikhs pay \\"between $10 and $20 million for a typical royal hunt,\\" she reports, and later eat the birds for their supposed aphrodisiac qualities.<br />Weaver's book does not end on a tidy note. She analyzes the state of Al Qaeda, which looks more amorphous than ever before, more inspired by bin Laden than under his direction. One Islamic source considers bin Laden as much a hero as Abraham Lincoln, while a State Department official tells Weaver that Al Qaeda is more like a clearinghouse of logistical support than a central organization sending out orders for mayhem.<br />Most of Al Qaeda's leaders are still at large, and President Pervez Musharraf rejects reports that they and wanted Taliban fugitives have settled in Pakistan. The general who seized power in 1999 stands torn between a public that is swinging towards pro-Taliban Islamic parties and a military that is not pleased with the amount of room he has given to American forces.<br />Looking through Weaver's window, the war is not nearly over. Its guerrillas are just regrouping. Afghanistan may be prelude to a more volatile mix next door.<br />* Ilene R. Prusher writes for the Monitor from Istanbul.	2003-02-02

In Israel's West Bank, several orthodox Jewish families from America have settled to make aliyah, a return to the land. Among them are Tova and her husband, Mike, who leave their upper-middle-class life in Baltimore for an apartment in Heavenly Heights, hard by the Jordanian border. Tova and Mike and their three children immerse themselves in the lives of the complex's other residents and attempt to adjust to ever-circling army helicopters and bomb searches.<br />Miller depicts their marginal existence in remarkable prose: The blue Judean sky is like \\"an eye restraining itself from tears.\\" Miller's fine writing contrasts the emigrants' religious rituals with the stark life outside their homes. There's devotion in almost every moment of the settlers' days; even starting life over in Israel is a sign of religious dedication.<br />To Miller's credit, the settlers are not homogeneous. Tova's closest friend, Debra, was raised in Appalachia on country music and stories of her absent Jewish father. Now Debra sings twangy versions of spiritual songs. Fiery Sandy has only one child, which makes her an anomaly in the building, and she has difficulty seeing her son for the troubled child he is. Mr. Stanetsky, a Holocaust survivor, is the building's mortgage godfather, a rich immigrant who subsidizes the settlers' payments.<br />The novel doesn't have a plot per se; instead it charts the settlers' emotional and spiritual adjustments to Israel and to their perceived roles as pioneers. However, what Miller's novel lacks in action is more than made up for by her memorable portraits of people out of sync with both the country they've left behind and with the political reality of their new home.<br />Judy Doenges is the author of \\"What She Left Me\\"; she teaches at Colorado State University. <br />© 2003 The Washington Post Company	2003-01-30

We both live for many decades, possibly a century. Our reproductive patterns are similar. Albatrosses take as long as 13 years to mature, engage in courtships that can last two years or more, and raise a single chick every other year (or three to four years for some species.) Albatrosses, like ourselves, are found from the Antarctic to the Far North and most places in between. <br />Of course, we spend our time on earth very differently. Albatrosses spend 95 percent of it at sea, usually in flight. They come ashore only to breed and nest, and even then they are constantly flying off on 2,000- to 3,000-mile foraging runs to collect each feeding for their chick. They can fly for many days without stopping, sleeping on the wing, wandering from tropical to subpolar seas in the course of a single foraging run.<br />Carl Safina wondered what we might learn about the world if we could see it from their perspective. Now, after shadowing these great birds by foot, ship, and satellite, he has painted a beautiful, awe-inspiring tableau of our world as you've never seen it: an interconnected universe of wind and waves, sun-blasted islands, teeming polar seas, broad-winged birds, and the far-reaching effects of civilization.<br />\\"Almost everything about the albatross is superlative and extreme,\\" Safina writes. They're huge, with an 11-foot wingspan. Masters of long-distance flight, they use less energy soaring over a stormy sea than they do while sitting quietly on their nests. They endure equatorial heat and ferocious Arctic storms, sometimes on the same feeding trip. And they travel far: By 50 years of age, a typical albatross has logged nearly 4 million miles.<br />Tracking them, Safina journeys to beaches covered with egg-laying sea turtles, crystalline Pacific waters filled with prowling tiger sharks, and island tern colonies so vast they're likened to \\"a white-noise cyclone of sound.\\"<br />But today, albatrosses' lives are tangled up with those of humans. Though their world is far removed from civilization, they're inundated with pesticides, antibiotics, and hormone mimics. They swallow bottle caps and cigarette lighters, become entangled in drift nets, or drown after seizing one of the millions of baited hooks dragged behind fishing vessels every year.<br />\\"Eye of the Albatross\\" relates some unforgettable scenes. At one point, Safina watches an albatross chick feeding from the mouth of its mother, just back from a 2,000-mile foraging trip. The chick gulps down globs of regurgitated squid and fish eggs, but then the mother has difficulty retching up the next serving. \\"Slowly, the tip - just the tip - of a green plastic toothbrush emerges from the bird's throat,\\" a sight Safina describes as \\"one of the most piercing things I've ever experienced.\\" The mother, unable to pass this bit of trash, wanders away from her squawking chick.<br />The lesson, Safina writes, is that there are no longer any places on earth unaffected by man. \\"No matter what coordinates you choose, from waters polar to solar coral reefs, to the remotest turquoise atoll - no place, no creature remains apart from you and me.\\"<br />Fortunately, in some places people are starting to correct the situation. Safina visits Midway Atoll, where the military accidentally introduced rats, which bred voraciously and extinguished entire nesting colonies. But since control of Midway passed to the National Wildlife Service, the rats have been eradicated, and the birds are recovering. In Alaska, Safina goes to sea with Mark Lundsten, a commercial fisherman leading the effort to save albatrosses from hooks. Lundsten has found a simple and cost-effective way to reduce albatross mortality by 90 percent with a combination of weights and streamers.<br />Safina, who earned a PhD studying seabirds, established himself as a leading voice in marine conservation with his first book,\\"Song for the Blue Ocean,\\" which drew attention to the environmental catastrophe unfolding beneath the waves. \\"Eye of the Albatross\\" is an eloquent sequel, a moving depiction of how interconnected life on this planet truly is.<br />* Colin Woodard is author of 'Ocean's End: Travels Through Endangered Seas' (Basic).<br />  <BR>from the May 16, 2002 edition - [...]	2003-01-19

The Bronx Zoo pays him to fly to parts of the world that have been off-limits to western scientists for generations.  He assembles a team and walks into the forest where he treks beyond the point at which effective government ends, beyond the last road negotiable by Land Rover, beyond the last village.  He comes back to report the existence of new species of large mammals previously unknown to science.   Then he arranges to have vast tracks of wild land set off as protected nature reserves. <BR> Rabinowitz  works for the organization that runs the Bronx Zoo, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and he doesn't actually find an entirely new species of large mammal every time he steps into the bush.   But the delicate Burmese leaf deer he discovered for science in 1997 is flourishing in  forests that his Burmese scientific and administrative collaborators are working to conserve.  Their efforts have resulted in the protection of 3.2% of the land area of Myanmar as national parkland or wildlife refuge.  And the adventures in Myanmar recounted in Beyond the Last Village are merely the latest exploits in a career spent mapping the last refuges of the nearly extinct Sumatran rhino, tracking tigers in Thailand,  and determining how large a jaguar preserve need be to succeed in preserving jaguar.<BR> No one is perfect.  Rabinowitz has a great story to tell, but he attempts to combine a sensitve exploration of his inner self with real-life adventures that play like an Indiana Jones movie.  The outcome can be bad enough to make you wince.  Here is Rabinowitz, the sensitive male, awaiting the birth of his child.<BR> \\"The due date came and went, and I was surprised at how rattled I was.  I had helped deliver a Mayan baby in the back of a pickup truck on a bumpy dirt road in  southern Belize.  I had sewn up my dog, Cleo, after his neck was ripped open by a jaguar.  I had ridden for help on a motorcycle in Thailand with a broken leg and a bamboo stake through my foot.  I had had to find my way out of the jungle with a subdural hematoma after a plane crash.  But nothing compared to this.  This was my child.\\"<BR> When Rabinowitz discovers a species unknown to science, he takes evidence to the Director of Genetics at the Bronx Zoo for expert confirmation.  If he had taken the account of his trip to a professional writer for similarly expert help he would have a best seller on his hands.  Make no mistake, Rabinowitz has a first-rate story to tell.   The sort of story that might have reached millions of readers around the world and persuaded them of the importance of saving the world's last wild places.  Instead we have a book that is almost wonderful.<BR> This is a great read nevertheless because Rabinowitz is the real deal.  He goes to places where we cannot go and sees things that we would never see.  Had I somehow gotten permission to hike into upland forests of Myanmar off limits to outsiders, I would have seen some pretty little deer.  Rabinowitz saw an undescribed species.  And while the writing may be clunky, the adventure is real.<BR> E. O. Wilson's new book, The Future of Life, is an elegant statement of the importance of preserving the biodiversity of this planet  by protecting large, intact ecosystems from exploitation.  Rabinowitz  takes the problem down to cases. <BR> His new species of leaf dear, along with bear, tiger, rhino and a bevy of southeast Asian species whose names I failed even to recognize, are endangered by poverty, and by a voracious Chinese appetite for bogus medicine and chimerical aphrodisiacs.  Sometimes it can take surprisingly little to save them.  <BR> In the remote highlands of Myanmar Rabinowitz and his Burmese colleague, Dr. U Saw Tun Khaing, discovered villages with no access to salt.  The only way that they could obtain this vital commodity was by hunting and selling wildlife parts to Chinese traders.  Rhino, the species most prized by credulous Chinese men, were extirpated in the area decades ago.  <BR> Dr. Khaing has now set up a system in which payment in salt and other goods is made to villages that preserve the wildlife around them.  Erstwhile hunters are employed as game monitors with the  cost  picked up by the Wildlife Conservation Society.   Salt and self-interest will surely do more to induce local people to preserve game than any number of wardens could. <BR> The pity is that poachers serving the Chinese market continue to hunt Asian rhino elsewhere.  My son, the college student, suggests that the only way to protect the last wild Asian rhinos from poachers is to provide free Viagra to every middle-aged man in China.  He just might be right.   Meanwhile, I'm glad that Alan Rabinowitz is on the job.	2003-01-17

Alexandra Morton listens to whales.  In their songs she hears not only the beauty and mystery of the deep, but keys to the complex lifeways of a species.  <BR> Listening to Whales is the coming of age story of a scientist. A surprising story because   Morton's first adult steps were taken in a decidedly unscientific direction. <BR>     As a teenager, Alexandra Morton felt stifled by school, which is hardly unusual.  Nor is it uncommon for a young girl to love animals.  It is, however, very unusual for accomplished parents who have had a French governess supervise their daughter's childhood as a prelude to sending her to one of New England's finest prep schools, to permit her to drop out in eleventh grade, demanding only that she &quot;do something with her life.&quot;<BR>     Freed from formal schooling, Morton became fascinated with a set of researchers attempting to learn how to speak with primates and marine mammals. She spent  several years attempting to decipher the languages of dolphins and of killer whales living in captivity.  But she only found her true calling when she followed the killer whales, orca, to their native waters.<BR> For Morton, the road to Damascas ran through Queen Charlotte Sound.  There, at age 22, she dipped her hydrophone into cold, Pacific waters and first heard the call of whales echoing  wild and free.  Hydrophones, invented by the British to track German U-boats, were applied to peaceful purposes after the war.  In 1979 the underwater listening device began to make Alexandra Morton into a scientist. <BR> Implausible as it seems a mere two decades later, no one in that year had a clear picture of what orca ate in the wild.  No one knew where they spent the winter, where they calved, or how the groups they travel in were composed.  And no one knew what information they were conveying with their haunting songs.   Morton wanted to find out.<BR> Living on remote islands off the coast of British Columbia, Morton married Robin Morton, a photographer who captured some of the first underwater footage of orca in the wild.  Together they pursued the whales in a small boat, their infant son swathed in waterproof parkas and tucked into a covered hammock in the bow.  <BR> Imagine taking your baby out in a small, inflatable Zodiac to a place where you might look up as \\"a wall of white water erupted near the head of the bay.  In the froth I glimpsed patches of black and white and tawny brown. A sea lion somersaulted through the air like a rag doll... Through the ear phones came the sound of orcas tearing the sea lions apart.  The whales moved so fast, they shook the sea lions out of their skins... Recently a harbor seal had jumped into a Zodiac to escape (orca) off Victoria.  I did not see how my boat would remain afloat if (an) 800-pound sea lion decided to come <BR>aboard.\\"<BR> By the time she began to study orca in the wild, Morton had outgrown her early hope of learning to talk to the animals and become a scientist trying to understand what they are communicating to each other.  The things that she and her fellow researchers learn as they follow the orca are remarkable.  Three races of orca live off western North America.  As separate as any human tribes, they are not known to interbreed and when they meet, the `tribes' either studiously ignore one another or mount aggressive displays of territorial defense.  No researcher has witnessed a `war' of the sort that Jane Goodall saw chimpanzees engage in, but the work is ongoing.  What is now well understood is that when orca vocalize the `tribes' use very different sounds with very different patterns.  Orca, that is, speak distinct languages that are mutually unintelligible and must be acquired in early childhood.   <BR>Moments of quiet triumph illuminate this absorbing tale.   The exaltation of getting a piece of work done right.  The eureka thrill of  knowing that what one has just figured out is altogether new in the world.  The day Morton's parents come to hear her read a paper at a scientific conference, and breath a sigh of relief.  Their calculated gamble has paid off.  The restless girl whom they allowed to follow her own path in life has launched a career that would make any parent proud.  <br />Diana Muir is the author of Bullough's Pond	2003-01-17

Rotberg<br />The life-giving Nile of lower Egypt trickles first from two springs in Burundi and Rwanda and then meanders 4,238 miles as the White Nile through great equatorial lakes; loses itself in tangled and difficult swamps; tortuously emerges to run freely toward its confluence with the much more powerful, if shorter, Blue Nile from Ethiopia; and then flows over cataracts and dams through the great desert to the Mediterranean Sea. <br />Over five millenniums, the nutrient- and silt-laden Nile floodwaters enabled agriculture and civilization to flourish all along its lower reaches. When the annual summer flood failed, however, the northern Sudan and all of classical and modern Egypt suffered hideously.<br />Collins links the dark ages of dynastic Egypt and the successes of invading outsiders to those sometimes prolonged periods when the Nile withheld its renewing gift. In turn, those dry spells reflected shifts in the rainfall patterns of equatorial Africa and highland Ethiopia, not - as the Egyptians always feared - to the manipulative scheming of Ethiopian monarchs or African chieftains.<br />There were many efforts to measure the flows of the Nile, and then to harness it effectively. Taming the Nile, the quixotic goal of administrators from early times, led to the first small dams, and in the early 20th century to dams in the Sudan. President Gamal Abdel Nasser's Aswan High Dam of 1970, with its 300-mile lake and its ancillary dam at Roseires in the Sudan, were together intended to regulate the river forever, smoothing out the years of high and low water. But the mighty Nile refused to capitulate, and the impoundment of its waters has led to great silting and weakening of the dams, the impoverishment of Egyptian agriculture, unexpected disease, and unanticipated economic and social consternation.<br />Collins's seamless biography captures the soul of a river that is both a result of and a continuing influence upon Africa's geology, climate, history, peoples, economy, and politics. Collins roams over the 2 million-square-mile basin of the Nile - the smaller rivers, the large and tiny lakes, and the glacier-capped mountain ranges - and writes movingly of the glory and challenges faced by the immense cascade of water as it makes its way over myriad waterfalls and past pumping stations, villages, towns, and cities to its ultimate destination. He also captures the trials and triumphs of the Nile's sometimes human- assisted passage through the Sudd - a vast eddying swamp-like mass of lagoons and channels that long defied explorers and entrepreneurs as they attempted to follow the White Nile south into equatorial regions.<br />Counterintuitively, more of the merged waters of the Nile come from the Blue branch, not the much longer and more tortuous White system. The Blue starts higher than the White, at 9,000 feet, and then rushes into shallow Lake Tana. From shores ringed by Coptic Christian monasteries, the Blue carves a great arc through the lava dikes and sandstone plateaus of western Ethiopia, strengthened by three significant and many minor tributaries until it leaves the highlands and crosses into the Sudan as a source of regular refreshment.<br />As in any great biography, there are diversions off the main channel. Collins swoops readers into the Baro Salient, that riverine mapmaking mistake that thrusts Ethiopia into the southern Sudan, where commerce coursed clandestinely across borders. He takes us on a fascinating search for 15-foot canaries - not in John Williams' standard \\"Field Guide to the Birds of East Africa\\" - high up in the Mountains of the Moon (the Ruwenzori Range). And he supplies unexpected facts. For instance, as mighty as the Nile may be, its volume of fresh water delivered to the Mediterranean is only 2 percent of the total of the Amazon River and 15 percent of that of the Mississippi River. For much of its 160 million-year history, the Nile emptied into the Indian Ocean; only in comparatively recent geological times has it flowed north.<br />This is an easy book to read and to like. Yet there are occasional anachronisms, where sketches of people or places forsake the findings of modern linguistic and ethnological scholarship, and repetition of pet phrases or factoids. But the book's big flaw is the fault of the publisher: The quality and clarity of the maps and photographs are inadequate for a study as important as this panoramic biography of a pulsing river.<br /> Robert I.

In the 1920s, a group of foresighted scientists managed to have the largest, Barro Colorado, with its nearly intact tropical forest, set aside as a scientific preserve.<br />In these pages, the present-day researchers of Barro Colorado spring vividly to life. Royte follows a young biologist from UC Berkeley, as the biologist follows a troop of spider monkeys.<br />Studying monkeys like this entails long days of trailing the agile little creatures as they skitter through the treetops, clambering easily from branch to branch. For an earth-bound researcher, keeping up with the troop entails scrambling up steep ravines, pushing through tangled undergrowth, and skidding down hillsides slick with rain. The early weeks are especially frustrating, as distrustful monkeys shy away from the interloper.<br />Royte, a New York journalist, is as much an interloper on the island as this scientist is among the troop of monkeys. The scientists, after all, have paid their dues to get here. They have spent years in graduate school, and they reach Barro Colorado only after their laboriously planned studies survive rigorous review to be selected for funding.<br />But Royte ingratiates herself by offering to help. On the island, these scientists work long hours, and conversation can be larded with arcane jargon incomprehensible to an outsider. She's willing to wade through this - and the muck of mangrove swamps - to hang insect traps on branches and sit on the forest floor counting the number of leaf-cutter ants that march past.<br />As they whiz across the lake in a Boston whaler, Royte is determined to pursue her subject at full throttle, even as the distinguished biologist perched in the bow tries to net moths without falling overboard. He shares his excitement about the natural world in all its magnificent complexity.<br />For instance, he tells her, urania moths migrate annually. Some years, however, only a few hundred appear. Other years, several hundred million moths fly past the island. No one knows where they come from or where they are bound. In Royte's retelling, scientific enthusiasm is infectious. Soon we, too, want to know what drives these winged nomads.<br />Readers will come away from &quot;The Tapir's Bath&quot; with an appreciation of the way narrow research questions become the material from which useful knowledge is constructed. But don't read it for that.<br />Read it for the thrill of the chase. Will the young researcher from Berkeley who has trudged the forest for three days without so much as a glimpse of a non-human primate ever locate her spider-monkey troop? Will the German biologist whose sophisticated equipment fails manage to contrive an impromptu method to measure the effect of leaf-cutting ants on the trees they harvest? And will the PhD candidate from the University of Michigan astound his professors by synthesizing a new theory to explain why biological diversity decreases with distance from the equator, or fulfill their expectations by failing even to discover why bats make tents?<br />And just whydoes a tapir take a morning bath?<br />* Diana Muir is the author of 'Bullough's Pond,' winner of the 2001 Massachusetts Book Award	2002-11-26
US	53075255	R89K3OLP0EJFJ	0679429328	701258128	Charles Darwin:The Power of Place	Books	5	14	14	N	N	a wonderful read	>...One morning in 1858 Charles Darwin picked up his mail and discovered a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin had spent 20 years working out evidence to support his theory of natural selection, secure in the knowledge that the theory was too radical and the details too arcane for anyone else to have thought out. He could have published all or part of his work at almost any point; his closest scientific friends often urged him to do so. But he kept silent because he dreaded the consequences: Publication would invite public condemnation likely to make Rome's reception of Galileo look friendly. He didn't think that he could bear the notoriety. <br />Then came the paper from Wallace, laying out the theory of natural selection in words that could very nearly have been Darwin's own.<br />Janet Browne could not have chosen a more dramatic incident to begin the second book of her riveting two-volume biography of Darwin. In the entire range of intellectual history, there is not a moment that tops the Darwin-Wallace collision for sheer human drama. With Wallace somewhere in the remote rain forest of southeast Asia - weeks away by the fastest steamers - no one would ever have known if Darwin had \\"lost\\" that manuscript. It is unlikely that he even considered such a course.<br />Over the course of these two volumes, we come to understand the man's character intimately. Partly because Browne has waded through endless bundles of family letters that have sat unread since the original recipients tied them with silk ribbons. Partly because Browne, a British professor of the history of biology, understands Darwin's world. But mostly because she is a master of the art of biography.<br />Darwin was bound to publish Wallace's paper. The great question was, would he publish his own? His agonized decision came down to deciding which he dreaded more: facing the public scorn that evolution aroused in Victorian England, or allowing credit for the theory that had been his life's work togo to someone else. At this point the story becomes weirdly modern.<br />Darwin inhabited an old-fashioned world that is very foreign to us. He got the chance to explore not because he was a qualified scientist, but because he was a conversable gentleman from the right sort of family. He never held a paying job. Some English gentlemen did work, but it was more respectable to settle in a big country house and live on inherited money. Charles married his first cousin, and each of them inherited part of grandpapa Wedgewood's china fortune.<br />But the most startlingly unmodern thing about Darwin was, in the words of his son Francis, \\"the curious fact that he who has altered the face of Biological Science, and is in this respect the chief of the moderns, should have written and worked in so essentially a non-modern spirit and manner.\\"<br />During the course of Darwin's career, scientific instrument makers began to produce equipment that improved, for example, the control of moisture or light available to growing plants. Yet Darwin continued to potter about the kitchen, rigging equipment with material borrowed from his wife's sewing basket. His hopelessly old-fashioned methods produced cutting-edge science right up to the year he died.<br />When it came to handling the publicity for \\"The Origin of Species,\\" by contrast, the slickest Madison Avenue PR firm could not have been more cutting edge than Darwin and his tailcoated friends. With finesse a modern publisher must envy, Darwin softened up potential reviewers by sending signed copies with admiring, personal notes to nearly every eminent scientist in Europe and America. (Full disclosure: I have never received a personal letter from either Janet Browne or Charles Darwin.)<br />As often as possible, however, Darwin's scientific friends avoided any risk of getting a bad review by writing the reviews themselves, an easier trick in the days when reviews ran anonymously. They also set about making certain that reviews would run in all the right places.<br />In the cozy Victorian world of British science, becoming a scientist in the first place indicated that one had come from a financially comfortable background. The eminent men of science and of letters had gone to the same schools and belonged to the same clubs, clubs whose more tedious members could tell you precisely which scientist was the cousin of which editor on precisely which side of the family.<br />This look inside the workings of Victorian science is among the great fascinations of Browne's book. Darwin's friends needed a compelling explication of evolution to move science forward. The minute Wallace's paper arrived, they pushed hard for Darwin to publish. No sooner had the \\"Origin\\" gone to the typesetter, than Darwin and his friends set about ensuring that not only the book but the theory itself would succeed. Every stop was pulled in the battle against creationism.<br />Finally, in a carefully orchestrated publicity maneuver on behalf of evolutionary theory, two dukes, one earl, the American ambassador, the president of the Royal Society, and four eminent scientists - Wallace, Hooker, Lubbock, and Huxley - carried the old atheist's coffin to a grave in Westminster Abbey. But not even death could free Darwin from controversy...	2002-11-26

At the core of the book is Ms. Muir's message that we are part of nature, not separate from or above nature, and we have a great responsibility to maintain the integrity of the environment. Granted, this message is not new. Where this book is very different is how Ms. Muir leads up to this message. She shows how the New England landscape changed from one where farming dominated to one that was a mixture of many different types of mills and factories. You learn the consequences of everything that was done along the way: the consequences to fish and birds of damming rivers; the consequences to forests and to the air we breath of heavy logging; the consequences of catching too many of one type of fish, etc. What is great about this book is that Ms. Muir does not deal in hazy generalities. She takes you step by step and shows you specifically how certain actions cause certain changes in the environment, often unforseen. There is nothing simplistic in her observations and she knows there are no easy answers. She lays out the data for you and you can come to your own conclusions. But what really takes this book to another level is the fascinating biographical information that Ms. Muir provides concerning the many, many New Englanders that invented the machines of the Industrial Revolution and kept the economy vibrant as the importance of agriculture diminished. The way this book is put together is very unusual, due to the combination of all of the above factors and in the space of 248 pages you will learn a great deal of information. The research Ms. Muir must have done in writing this book is staggering and her knowledge across many different areas is amazing. Don't miss reading this book.	2002-08-01

Diana Muir gives an account of the interplay between New England's economic history and its environment in a lapidary prose which never leaves the reader behind. By the end of the book we are enlightened about the ebb and flow of these matters over the five hundred-odd years from early European settlement to modern times without ever being overwhelmed, for Ms Muir always wears her erudition lightly. <br />She breaks new ground in her treatment of the environment as both an economic resource and as a complex-often vulnerable-amalgam of ecosystems. Her thesis is that we are living on capital, be it fossil fuel, topsoil or forest-she is particularly compelling on the vulnerable biochemistry of these last. Unusually, however, Ms Muir is scrupulous in her use of statistics and fastidious in her argument. She never seeks to undermine the legitimacy of the economic impulse, though she does not flinch from her conclusion: an argument for restraint in economic activity and population.<br />Nor does she lose sight of the propensity of ecosystems to renew themselves, albeit often in new forms: she is pleased-almost amused-by the return of the beaver and the moose, while regretting the extinction of the elm and the emergence of local spruce monocultures. Indeed Ms Muir expresses herself more forcefully on the loss of flora than fauna. Perhaps this is because the long life cycles of the former make it harder to take an optimistic view of their capacity to renew themselves. Alternatively it may be because the collapse of agriculture in New England following the opening up of the West, has stimulated the return to southern New England of so many species formerly evicted to Canada. <br />Reflections in Bullough's Pond is no naïve elegy for a Paradise Lost; it never loses sight of a human interplay with the landscape which long antedates industrialisation, not to say European settlement. In a particularly ingenious section of the book, Ms Muir reminds us that in the middle of the nineteenth century, the courts and legislatures altered common law doctrines of liability to free up industrial activity. This reflected the climate of the times. Ms Muir argues that the climate of our own times may well give rise to more extensive liability concepts to restrain the corporations, notions very much with the tail wind of popular and professional thinking.<br />Given the book's generosity and elegance, it seems curmudgeonly to cavil at any part of it. But a couple of issues do arise. First forests. Since the invention of agriculture, we have cleared them for the simple reason that we have better uses for the land. This has been going on in the Old World for millennia. Of course there have been local environmental disasters, eg in North Africa and Mesopotamia, but nothing sufficiently general to justify veneration of forests as a precautionary measure. This is an artefact of late-twentieth century sentiment in the New World. There such virgin forests as have not lost within living memory are being destroyed even now, thus the local salience of the issue. Over the past fifteen years their defenders have sought to enlist support by arguing that they served one or another vital purpose: producing oxygen, acting as feedstock for drugs, now Ms Muir points to their role in topsoil. The first two arguments are infrequently heard these days. As to the last, let me point out that where I grew up in the eastern part of England, the ground was cleared eight or nine hundred years ago, but the topsoil remains sufficiently fertile for the local farmers to get out record yields.<br />I was also left uncertain as to the course Ms Muir might prescribe for the several billion who have never seen Bullough's Pond, and whose habitats have been profoundly altered by economic activity for millenia rather than centuries. The residents of Asia's great river valleys cleared the forests long before Columbus saw the New World. They have to eat-with luck raise themselves above thoughts of the next meal. Ms Muir has practical suggestions as to how the courts might restrain US corporations, but nothing on how to restrain the aspirations of those who dream of a fraction of American prosperity. I suspect she is wise enough to know that there is nothing to be done on this score. In a rare nod towards the nether reaches of environmental alarmism, she hints that she expects nature to impose population restraint, if we do not. I am more sanguine. In whatever might come to pass as in what has come before, we will wade through. As we must.	2002-07-25

And, boy, does Flannery cover the territory. A student of the animal kingdon, he has covered a lot of physical territory in his career, studying the remains of extinct species and searching for undescribed living ones in the forests of New Guinea. Small wonder, then, that Flannery is at his best when contemplating the forces that led to the evolution or extinction of species, or of entire classes of species. In the pages of Eternal Frontier ancient periods of warm climate conjure tropical forests in the Dakotas and create strange herbivorous beasts who munch their way across the landscape, only to be swept away by the onset of an ice age. The pleasure for readers is that Flannery doesn't just describe what took place, he leads us into an understanding of the process whereby creatures evolve to fill vacant niches in an evolving ecosystem. It is wonderful stuff.<br />The closer we come to the present day, however, the further Flannery moves from material he knows really well. Readers spoiled by such masterful works of ecological history as William Cronon's Changes in the Land and Donald Worster's Rivers of Empire will find Flannery shallow indeed. <br />In truth, this entire, wonderful book will not bring much pleasure to readers who are familiar with the subjects covered. When confronted with confusing evidence that might support one of several plausible historical scenarios, Flannery picks the one he finds most compelling and dismisses the others. Extinction of the paleolithic megafauna, for example, was here caused by overhunting by spear-carrying paleo-Indians, the first humans to enter the western hemisphere, who arrived about 13,000 years ago. This dismisses some major areas of evidence to the contrary. Flannery is, of course, familiar with this evidence. Readers will not discover how compelling some of it is. When the story reachesEuropean settlement, it becomes clear that Flannery has only a cursory familiarity with the literature. The irony is that both when dealing with the pre-history he knows so well and with the historical period with which he is less familiar, Flannery has a sure instinct for apparant truth. Most of the hypothesis that he ignores or dismisses are, indeed, less well-supported than the story he tells. And even when in discussing the historical period he gets lots of the details wrong, he has the grand outline right. A reader of Eternal Frontier will have a very good grasp of how nature continues to shape America. <br />The advantage of Flannery's approach is that he tells a ripping good story. It moves quickly, it is fun to read, it is thought-provoking, and it is even true.	2002-07-21

Here Muir examines the New England landscape from the perspectives of ecology, economics and history and makes each topic come alive as it is informed by the others. The prose is excellent and the pace and choice of examples kept me intrigued to the end. As someone who spends a good deal of time teaching about the topics that Muir focuses on I tend to be a sceptical consumer but here I found myself constantly nodding &quot;yes!&quot; or exclaiming &quot;Aha! NOW I understand why THAT happened&quot;. This is a great book for students of Landscape Ecology as well as anyone seriously interested in the history and ecology of New England, and I suspect that even people who have never set foot east of the Mississippi will still benefit greatly from having read it.	2002-07-21

Because chairs in Middle Eastern studies were generously funded by Arab oil states, univeristies granted tenure to scholars whose work was decidedly inferior, work that would not have passed minimal standards of scholarship in any other department of the university.  Because these men and women were imbued with post-colonial theore (ie. the theory states that everything that is bad in the Middle East is the fralut of former colonial powers,) they were unable to take a clear-eyed look at the Middle East and spot, for example, the fact that many Islamists were bent on violence.

We have all heard rebbe stories, have learned from the books left by these men, and have read of the lives of their followers.  This, however, is a glimpse into the private lives of the aristocrats of European Hasidism.  I do not use the word aristocracy lightly. The world of European Hasidism was highly stratified.  The Rebbe's Daughter was top drawer.  She lived in a large compound of servants, storerooms, and guest rooms for visitors to her father.  There were coachmen, cooks, and governesses.  There was no idle luxury.  Every member of the rebbe's family lived a life of constant and devoted service.  They served the Rebbe's followers, but also, and far more importantly, they served God.  <br />Devotion to Torah pervaded every aspect and every moment of life.  There is a kind of awe-filled beauty to a life in which every action, every thought is examined and consecrated to divine service.  Devotion to Torah was so complete that even in the icy Polish winter the family shunned clothing made of wool.  Better to shiver in silk and cotton than to risk a chance linen fiber that may render a woolen coat forbidden shatnes. <br />I cannot decide which aspect of the Rebbe's Daughter is more remarkable.  The way it shows us a vivid picture of a vanished  time and place, or the way it opens before us the way of thinking of a mind totally devoted to Torah.	2002-04-02

The plot is set in motion when a nobleman wills his fortune to his male heir, but wills his title to his daughter.  Not possible.  Titles were never at the disposal of the holder.  There were very rare cases, such as that of the first Duke of Marlborough, when there was no male issue, and the family was well connected at court, when a daughter's son inherited the title by special dispensation of the Crown.  The second absurdity is that we have a countess, the widow of a wealthy man, left virtually penniless.  English law prevented such a thing.

Plot twists, narrative drive, suspense: all depend on the story of two people falling in love.  And the characters are all plausible.  the bonus is that the romance between the hero and herione actually sizzles.  Mindel has given us a love story that actually pulsates with - love.	2001-07-25

Longitude wasn't a bad read, albeit it was not a very sophisticated treatment of the chronometer and the author never explained the technology behind the laminated metal springs that were Harrison's great contribution.  Probably she didn't know enough metallurgy.       Aczel doesn't know enough history to attempt a story that covers this much territory.  His efforts to summarize, say, the rise and fall of Venice in three paragraphs reads like a seventh grade book report.  His literary device of centering the book in the old trading port of Amalfi fails for similar reasons.  He lacks the knowledge of history to bring complex events into focus, and he seems to have had little interest in learning about his subject. Aczel appears to have read one book about Venice, one about China and one about Marco Polo, before he sat himself down to produce this slender volume.  On the very simple level, we want to know what sort of harbor medieval Amalfi had before it was destroyed by an earthquake.  An artificial mole like Cesarea perhaps?  If so, who built it? and when?  Or did it once have a natural breakwater, later destroyed by earthquake?  Did he even try to find out?  <br />What Aczar does instead of answering our questions and leading us along new paths of knowledge is to pound us over the head with simplistic pronouncements, acting as though widely known facts were new discoveries.  The Chinese, he proclaims, invented the compass.<br />But this is hardly news.  Bright eighth graders know as much.  But bright eighth graders would be bored to tears reading The Riddle of the Compass.  <br />Please, Mr. Aczel, go back to writing about subjects that you know and care about.	2001-07-24

Perhaps we should not be surprised that a Harvard grad who spent two years reading literature at Oxford before going on to medical school should use the language with mastery.  If not surprised, then, we are delighted. Delighted by his sensitivity to word and nuance, by the way characters and plot lines from classic novels are woven in, and by meeting fragments from the work of favorite poets worked seamlessly into the text.<br />Insight into time and place is marvelous, the beach-plum and cedar-shingled Cape of the fifties and the trophy homes of the New England shore in the new millenium.<br />Any graying SUV owners plagued by the nagging suspicion that they may have been on to something real in their barefoot, bell-bottomed, anti-materialist salad days will find validation in Kramer's vision.<br />Frustrated environmentalists who know that the ecosystem is dying around us while George W. fiddles, will find catharsis. <br />Most of all, however, we recognize ourselves in the pages of Spectacular Happiness. Kramer has a knowing finger on the pulse of our celebrity-obsessed, posession-conscious, tummy-tucked culture in a novel for our times.	2001-07-03

And, boy, does Flannery cover the territory.  A student of the animal kingdon, he has covered a lot of physical territory in his career, studying the remains of extinct species and searching for undescribed living ones in the forests of New Guinea.  Small wonder, then, that Flannery is at his best when contemplating the forces that led to the evolution or extinction of species, or of entire classes of species.  In the pages of Eternal Frontier ancient periods of warm climate conjure tropical forests in the Dakotas and create strange herbivorous beasts who munch their way across the landscape, only to be swept away by the onset of an ice age.              The pleasure for readers is that Flannery doesn't just describe what took place, he leads us into an understanding of the process whereby creatures evolve to fill vacant niches in an evolving ecosystem.  It is wonderful stuff.<br />      The closer we come to the present day, however, the further Flannery moves from material he knows really well.  Readers spoiled by such masterful works of ecological history as William Cronon's Changes in the Land and Donald Worster's Rivers of Empire will find Flannery shallow indeed.  <br />      In truth, this entire, wonderful book will not bring much pleasure to readers who are familiar with the subjects covered.  When confronted with confusing evidence that might support one of several plausible historical scenarios, Flannery picks the one he finds most compelling and dismisses the others.  Extinction of the paleolithic megafauna, for example, was here caused by overhunting by spear-carrying paleo-Indians, the first humans to enter the western hemisphere, who arrived about 13,000 years ago.  This dismisses some major areas of evidence to the contrary.  Flannery is, of course, familiar with this evidence. Readers will not discover how compelling some of it is. When the story reaches European settlement, it becomes clear that Flannery has only a cursory familiarity with the literature.  The irony is that both when dealing with the pre-history he knows so well and with the historical period with which he is less familiar, Flannery has a sure instinct for apparant truth.  Most of the hypothesis that he ignores or dismisses are, indeed, less well-supported than the story he tells.  And even when in discussing the historical period he gets lots of the details wrong, he has the grand outline right. A reader of Eternal Frontier will have a very good grasp of how nature continues to shape America. <br />    The advantage of Flannery's approach is that he tells a ripping good story.  It moves quickly, it is fun to read, it is thought-provoking, and it is even true.	2001-04-25

But the astonishing truth is that William Henry Perkin really did change the world.  His purple dye was the first synthetic chemical, precourser of an industry that has given so much comfort to the world: everything from wash-and-wear fabrics to Tupperwear.  The irony, of course, is that although I write this review on a plastic keyboard, sitting on a desk chair covered with synthetic fabric, shod in a pair of composite-fabric Teva sandals - all products made possible by the synthetic chemical industry that followed in the wake of the invention of analine dye - the industry that Perkin fathered is the less significant of the two ways in which his enterprising research changed the world.  The more significant change is that fact that so many chemical products and byproducts of chemical manufacture persist in the environment, altering the hormonal structure of animals in alarming ways.  The effects of these chemicals, which threaten our health in very serious ways, are best described in Theo Colborn's wonderful book, Our Stolen Future.	2001-04-16

Peter Jay is, after all, a man of great distinction.   Unfortunately he has written a wholly inadequate book.  Perhaps the kindest  thing to say is, well, what ought one to expect of a book issued together  with a television series?  Jay has written a complete history of the world  according to money, but I will be generous and  divide the book into two  parts: the part of history about which Jay knows a great deal and the part  about which he knows nothing.  Before sixteenth century Europe is reached,  Jay knows nothing and has made no effort to learn.   To mention only some  of the more glaring omissions, he is completely unaware of the entire body  of work on economic involution in east and south Asia, and utterly  unconversant with the vast body of literature describing the by now  well-studied consequences that environmental depredations have had on  economic systems.  To be sure, these fields of research did not exist when  Mr. Jay read for his A-levels.  Some of us, however, have kept up with the  leading thought in our chosen fields over the last four decades or so.   Most of us who presume to write books have certainly attempted to do so.   Perhaps it is best to skip the first half altogether and get to the  material dear to Jay's heart: modernity and the superiority of open  political systems in the matter of producing prosperity.  True.  Hardly  original, but true.  Albeit it has all been said better elsewhere and  often.  What Jay touts as his great original contribution, a proposed  economic waltz step in which there is 1) an economic  advance  2)the  prosperity generated by this advance attracts predators in the form of  outside raiders or internal moochers whereupon 3) the economic advance must  be bprotcted by policing and defense.  Does anybody find this useful?  I  did not.  Yet it is the only original thought offered in this 383 page  tome.  Oh, yes, did I mention that the book reads as though it was written  by speaking into a dictaphone?	2000-09-15

Why, after all, should Japan have been be rich while Taiwan was poor, if culture did not matter?  Or Denmark been a nation of farmers while Holland held dominion over the trade routes of the  world?  And why, as is asked in one of the most frustratingly tentative  essays in this very variable volume, do different immigrant groups to the  United States have such very different careers?  Of course, it is  unfashionable to ask such questions lest someone believe that to say  culture matters is to imply that race matters: ie that members of wealthy  races are inherently superior to members of poor races.  Perhaps that is  why the most compelling essays in this book are by an African development  economist and a Latin American journalist who exclaim impatiently that of  course culture matters and insist that the thing their nations need is to  discover the cultural components of economic success and import some.  Even  more refreshing is the essay by Ronald Inglehardt who brings - gasp -  actual measurable data to this debate.  Not that anything is quite settled.   We are still left with the big questions, like: Why Europe?  Why not  China?  and What was so special about eighteenth century England?  On those  questions, permit me to recommend two other new books.  Nathan Pomeranz's  THE GREAT DIVERGENCE, which bends over backwards to prove that China could  equally well have given us the industrial revolution, but for a few chance  occurances that have nothing to do with culture.  And BULLOUGH'S POND by  Diana Muir, which, in the course of discussing a number of other things,  does lead one to wonder if there may have been something about those  Calvinists after all.	2000-07-23

This may please some looking for light reading, but it brings so little to the table, especially when compared to substantial works like Howard Chapelle's The Search for Speed Under Sail.   Chapelle (out of print, but in the library) has it all, the understanding  of sail and of how the clippers developed, for smuggling, of course.   Smuggling opium into China and slaves out of Africa.  Which explains why  the Baltimore gave birth to the clipper.  Baltimore was our greatest  slaving port in the days after  the trade became illegal, and the British  Navy dedicated ships to intercepting slave traders.  Nor does Shaw give us  an idea of the economics of the clipper, the extremely high number of  sailors needed to spread all of that canvas at the same time the size of  the hold was reduced to streamline the ship for speed.  Clippers could only  be profitable when carrying extremely high-value cargo for extremely long  distances in cases where time mattered. That,of course, is why the greatest  clipper races were not to California but to London.  The premium paid by  the London market for the first of the year's tea crop made clipper ships  pay, few other runs did.  Nor does Shaw go into the question of why the  greatest clippers were built in East Boston and not Baltimore or London, a  question prababy best answered by Samuel E. Morison, our great sailor  historian, or by Diana Muir in her dazzling new history of New England,  Bullough's Pond.	2000-07-19

Here, finally, a historian gives us a narrative of human triumph.  After all, we know very well that as a group and as individuals we often behave badly, make  mistakes, and choose to pursue grubby, greedy goals.  But not always.  How  refreshing it is to find an historian willing to celebrate individuals who  have devoted their lives to pursuing noble ambitions.  I liked it for the  same reasons that I liked Diana Muir's recent Bullough's Pond with its  unabashed celebration of the entreprenurial spirit. I won't quibble with  the triumphalist tone, this book is frank about its goals and they are what  make reading it fun.  I will complain only that the sketches are a bit,  well, sketchy.  I would have found longer, more thoughtful portraits even  more compelling, even if they had given us to understand that even these  exemplary men and women were complex, had difficulties and sometimes got it  wrong.  What is important is that this book holds up for our admiration a  group of people who devoted their lives to making our world better.	2000-07-19

After all it is rare in the world that an individual who cut such an outrageous swath through life should have been of some actual significance.  Casanova,  Nell Gwyn, and Butch Cassidy all cut outrageous swaths, but the world was  not altered by their having lived.  Law, on the other hand, was the father  of the South Sea Bubble, a financial manipulation that affected financial  policy in several nations for a century or more.  Why only four stars?  I  like my history straight.  Well written, even witty, if possible, but hold  the fictionalization.  We cannot know, after all, what anyone thought or,  usually, what they said.  I do like a good story well told, and I like  well-told stories about money especially well.  For my money, the best such  story this season is the unheralded Bullough's Pond.  Lots of money, good  writing, no fictionalizing.	2000-07-17

Generals, politicians, scients and poets all have their place, but it is the guys who figure out how to make things work who drive the process of change in  history.  the advantage of Leinhard, is that he makes engineering  interesting.

The writing is dazzling, the thinking incisive, well, perhaps a tad less incisive the closer it gets to the modern world.  Diamond notwithstanding, culture does matter.  The more  complex civilization has become, the more culture seems to matter.  Also  forms of government, of course.  Bad or authoritarian government can drive  a prosperous nation into backwardness (look at how Hungary, once an  industrial powerhouse, sank once it was locked behind the Iron Curtain) and  certainly it is difficult to turn to any explanation other than culture for  explaining, say, the different trajectories of varying ethnic groups after  emigration to the United States.  Fortunately, we are not without books on  this subject that are as good as what Diamond gives us on the neolithic  revolution and its consequences.  Interested readers might take up CULTURE  MATTERS a collection of scholarly studies of the influence of cultrual  attitudes on economic development.  Or BULLOUGH'S POND, a brilliantly  written book that looks at the history of a region where culture does,  indeed, seem to have mattered intensely.   Or THE GREAT DIVERGENCE, in  which Kenneth Pomeranz set out to prove that the great leap into sustained  growth might have been made by China as easily as by Europe, and succeeded  only in convincing me that the cultural differneces between China and the  West may not have meant that the West was 'superior' in any absolute sense,  but did militate toward an industrial revolution happening in England, not  the Yangzi Delta.	2000-07-12

What more can you ask of a book?  Oh, right, some people want a book thatexempts culture from a role in human affairs.  Since culture is  one of the few factors over which humans have complete control, I would not  care to have it turn out not to matter.  I hope that we can tease out the  cultural attitudes that lead, for example, to a non-racist social  atmosphere.   For those who enjoy Landes and for those who find him  politically incorrect, I have some suggestions.  Read CULTURE MATTERS,How  Values Shape Human Progress, a collection of essays that attempt to prove  or disprove Landes-style thinking on economic history using the full  arsenal of social research techniques.  Or try Diana Muir's BULLOUGH'S POND  which, besides being one of the best-written non-fiction titles I've ever  read, is the history of a region where culture, indeed seems to have  mattered.  Or try  The Great Divergence, in which Kenneth Pomeranz  struggles to explain the rise of the west without resorting to culture.	2000-07-12

Fix yourself some ice tea, put your feet up, and pretend that  you are sitting among the foxglove and asters in a New England garden, even  if you're stuck on the twentieth floor of a New York City high-rise.  This  is summer in the country as it should be.  The pleasures of country life  are so vivid, along with the absurdities, the weeds, the mud, the  mosquitoes, and the contretemps that can only be dealt with by laughing,  that you may be tempted to move to a small, rural village.  Unless you  happened to also read The Enduring Shore and have decided to move to a  saltwater village on Cape Cod.  Or to read Bullough's Pond and are looking  for a small lake within commuting distance of Boston.  Or, well, you could  just check them all out of the library and put yor feet up.  It's been a  great season for books about New England.	2000-07-10

He does what we hope a fine reporter will do, takes us to places we cannot visit ourselves and makes us understand those places, and to see ourselves more clearly.  I suppose that  it is not entirely surprising that some of the finest reporting being done  today is on what is certainly the most important issue now facing the  planet: the degradation of our environment.  My other favorite of the  spring crop of books is Diana Muir's surprisingly delightful Bullough's  Pond, Economy and Ecosystem.  Read Woodard, the book is a pleasure and you  will learn a thing or two along the way.  What more could you ask for?	2000-07-09

I had not heard anything about the book Bullough's Pond,  whereas one can hardly miss hearing about Enduring Shore.  What a surprise  the two books were.  Enduring Shore is a very pleasant read, it takes you  along all of the familiar channels of Cape history and lore.  It is very  nicely written, but there are no surprises here.  I do think it is more fun  when a book surprises me, dazzles with a bit of lyrical prose, uses a turn  of phrase to make me see familiar things in a new light, tells me something  that I never knew, or makes me think of something in a fresh light.   Bullough's Pond does all of that, Enduring Shore was more like having a  friendly chat with an old acquaintance.  No surprises, just a very pleasant  way to spend a summer afternoon.	2000-07-09

We have not been  kind to the planet, and if you want the details of our agressive assault on  the planetary ecosystem that we depend upon, McNeill lays it all out in  black and whate.  We have exterminated species, depleted topsoil, sullied  our waters supply and warmed the atmosphere to truly dangerous levels.  A  somewhat less gloomy account of the human impact on the land can be found  in Diana Muir's recently puvblished, Reflections in Bullough's Pond.  In  addition to being a wonderful storyteller, Muir gives some grounds for  hope.  Muir seems to feel that the record of past human creativity in  problem-solving implies that we can solve our environmental problems, too.  On the other hand, perhaps McNeill is right in implying that as a species  we are capable only of destruction.	2000-07-09

Shutkin ralizes that our problems are serious, even  life-threatening.  But he thinks that we can begin to resolve them, if only  we can find the will to begin, rather in the style of Diana Muir in her new  book Bullough's Pond.

For my money, the five line description of Bligh's  voyage that appears incidentally in Diana Muir's Bullough's Pond gives us  all the essentials.  Of course, Muir is in the midst of another story.      For all his defense of Bligh and his undoubtedly virtuoso navigational  skills, Toohey fails to convince that he was a great leader.  The plain  fact is that British captains almost routinely led sullen, ill-educated,  ill-clad, ill-housed, ill-fed men on nearly unendurable journeys and got  them home again without mutiny.  Bligh's men rebelled twice.  How great a  captain can he have been?	2000-06-21

Suddenly, you realize that the train is at the final stop, while you were supposed to get off three stations back.   Diamonds prose is so excellent, his arguments so compelling, his answers to  questions that most of us had never thought to ask so persuasive that it is  someting of a  surprise to finish the book and realize that he has gone too  far.  Geography may be important, but surely it is not everything.  If it  were, why was Taiwan primitive while Japan was advanced and wealthy?  Why  was Holland the wealthiest province on the continent while Denmark was a  nation of peasant farmers?  Why did northern Italy lead the renaissance  only to fall into backwardness, before resurging to become a powerhouse of  twentieth century industry?  Culture matters.   Nevertheless, we are all in  debt to Diamond.  Rarely are such important ideas presented in such a  well-written book.  David Fisher's Albion's Seed comes to mind, and Diana  Muir's recent Bullough's Pond, but it is rare to find someone who is both  an original thinker and a good writer.	2000-06-20

After all, if culture doesn't matter why is Singapore rich while Banglsdesh starves?  The problem with this sort of thing is that  it is so hard to pin down.  Jared Diamond, after all, can tell us exactly  how many domesticable plants there were per square mile on any given coast,  and a phalanx of econometric historians tells us how taxes or wages  impacted growth at given points in the past.  By comparison culture is a  slippery customer.  Still, this is an interesting read.  As a  companion volume, I recommend Diana Muir's Reflections in Bullough's Pond,  a dazzling little volume that plays out the culture wars on the ground.	2000-06-20

It is hard to blame the man for wanting to sell enough books to make some money.   It is somewhat harder to take the amount of gore in Rivers of Blood, but  one has to concede that he has the formula down.  To sell books one must  write about a) bad guys, b) harrowing, boodthirsty murder, c) really simple  ideas.  Here we have world class bad guys in the Europeans who set out to  conquer the world by murdering all the people who lived everywhere else.   The fact that these people fought back and sometimes won adds drama.  But,  hello?  What about the role or European diseases, or the role of a European  economic system that surely did as much as European weapons to destroy the  non-European civilizations.  Bloodthirsty conquest is as old as history.   If the only thing that happened in the sixteenth century was that a bunch  of European guys got on boats and set out to conquer other people, there   would be no news to report.  Mark Crocker misses most of the really  important aspects of the Eurppean conquest of the world.  I prefer my  history more complex and closer to reality.

It is more of a meander along the coast of the Cape and Islands.  Paul Theroux expressed it well in his review in the New York Times, calling this a work of  &quot;intelligent peculiarity,&quot; and complaining that the history of  the Cape and Islands that we are promised in the title, is never delivered  in the text.  What we get instead are Schneider's rather charming musings  about topics like Pacific whaling and first encounters between Amerindians  and Europeans.  As Theroux points out, if someone actually wanted to  understand the region, this book would, at best, provide a place to start.   I enjoyed it, but on the whole I preferred Reflections in Bullough's Pond.   Talk about misleading titles!
