Since autos are as much sculpture as any bronze statue, this is a book to present a standard in automotive art.  Definitely a winner for anyone's book collection. From examples of the printer's art to fine examples of photography, this is worth not buying that bottle of wine you were thinking of.    Buy it!  The only drawback is the number of mouthwatering concept cars that will never be on the market.   Sob!!	2003-02-01

Briddish mystery, with much toing and froing.  The main character may seem a bit dry, but by the end of the story she has loosened up quite a bit.  Such as going to a pub!  I expect that there will be an expansion of her character with perhaps a bit of, dare I say it, romance?  Anyhoo, Brett is off to a good start with this one and the second book is on the shelves.  Treat yourself to seaside England....tides, rain and some snooty people doing their thing.   Enjoy, and aloha...	2002-05-11

Laura does make some solid points in this, but most of the bottom-feeders that need to read this, won't.  Her biggest problem is using her concept of a god, to *prove* that what she says is correct.  Instead of just stating that such and such type of behavior is not correct, she has to use a particular religion to *prove* it.  Always be leary of using a religion as the foundation to build your arguement on.  Laura evidently feels that there is only one valid religion and uses it to write her books.  As any logical person realizes, there can only be one valid religion or none at all.  In Laura S's, the Judeo/Christian is THE valid religion and bases her interpretations on that belief systems.  Gee Whiz, that ignores the millions of Buddhists..Muslims..Confucious' etc.  Religion wise Laura, you are in the minority...Cheers	2001-02-28

These sanctimonious fakirs should be ridden out of politics on a rail.  The author tells what he can, because much of the evidence is now locked up for the next 50 years.  What is so damaging that the public, whose taxes paid for all this, is not allowed to see.  Whose reputations are on the line.  Clinton, who I admired for the first few years, really does have feet of clay, and does not want to go down in the history books as such.<br />Many of the reviews seem to gloss over the important post that Mr.Schippers and seem to want to portray him as someone that is just barely staying in the limits of the truth.  Having read the book and heard him interviewed for an hour, I for one, would dearly love to see all those documents that are locked up!  His battles with various politicians just shows what nebishes they really are.  A perfect example of their trustworthiness is an article in the paper today (102700) regarding some of them that promised not to seek re-election, but now that their terms are up, they are going back on their promises.<br />As I said at the beginning, do not read while eating, because this book really should upset your systems.

Still holding the Russians up as the boogie man.  They can't even get a closeure in their own provinces.  Their ships and land units are rusting in place.  No one wants to serve in the military anymore, and bug out when they can. The author completely ignores our spy satallite abilities.  Their transportation capabilities are almost nil.  Life expentancy over the past 10 years has dropped, yes dropped, as much as 20 years in some areas.  Russia is a 3rd world country, surrounded by 5th world countries.

No matter what you think of Buchanan as a person, this is a very precise account of how this country has stopped believing in &quot;no foreign entanglements&quot; and decided  to be the policeman of the world.  That's policeman of the parts of the  world that our government decides to police.  I guess that the slaughter of  the Hutu's and Tutsi's did not require calling 911!  As other reviewers  have entered, this should be required reading in all high school history  classes.  Forget about &quot;the only date that sticks, is Will-i-am the  Conqourer, and that's 1066.&quot;  Above all, this is written in a manner  that is most enjoyable.
