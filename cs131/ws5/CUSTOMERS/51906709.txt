While glass tar bound them together, it also was instrumental in testing their relationship. Khaled Hosseini has written an emotional account of friendship and its responsibility. <br /> <br />One of the things I really like about  \\"The Kite Runner\\" is the way Hosseini has developed the characters. It is almost like reading an autobiography and it is through the characters we learn of another culture. We are reminded that our way isn't the only way. <br /> <br />The term kite runner was new to me. I had no idea there even was such a thing, or person. From the book title, one could easily suspect that a kite flyer is a kite runner. You will learn all about it when you read the book.

For that, I am grateful. <br /> <br />In \\"The Broker\\", Grisham methodically leads the reader through an array of obstacles that kept me intrigued, interested, and on the edge of my chair to the end of the book. It is Grisham at his finest and once page one was read, it was hard to put the book down. <br /> <br />Between the various worldwide governments and their representative assassins, does the main character, Joel Backman, have a chance of surviving? Because Backman possesses information related to very sophisticated technology, he is being pursued by various  governments, including the United States. The reader follows Backman, known as the broker, on an exciting international adventure of survival. <br /> <br />Who knows, maybe Grisham will follow up on this book with a sequel.	2005-02-10

John Grisham's \\"The Last Juror\\" is a great book and one of my Grisham favorites. <br />In \\"The Last Juror\\", we learn about living in a small southern town during the 1970's.  As we get to know the various characters in the story, many components of individual life, family life, community life, and small town life are revealed. It is through the owner of the local, weekly newspaper, and the newspaper itself that we learn of the town's many lives.  <br />The work ethic surrounding the local newspaper appears to be lax, but in spite of individual shortcomings, the job gets done. The editor, reporters, photographer, and others all do their part to get the paper out on time. One particularly interesting aspect of the paper is the importance and detail placed on the obituaries, a carry-over from the previous owner.<br />Murder happens in small towns, too, and this Mississippi newspaper covers the trial with ardent abandon. Among the jury members is one black, the first to ever serve here on a trial jury. You will enjoy knowing this juror, who, outside the trial, shares family, religion, friendship, input on segregation and integration, and much more. In fact, before the jury selection took place, readers of the newspaper were presented with a detailed, two-part biographical look at this person.<br />As serious as this story is, Grisham still manages to include humor throughout the book. Political events occur and are ones that make you wonder about \\"the system\\". The community, businesses, and individuals are faced with change that affects all these lives.	2004-03-18

The first time I stopped reading was on page 111, but later picked up the book, hoping to get to the final page. However, on page 129 I decided again, enough is enough. There just isn't enough interest and believability in the story to continue.<br />One curious characteristic of this book is that Guterson has chosen not to use quotation marks in the dialogues, and I wonder why he left them out.

Class reunions have shown me that the high school hero frequently is not a very successful person in present day reality, and this book is the epitome that perception. (Of course this isn't true in all cases).<br />My feelings are quite mixed in regard to the subject presented in \\"Bleachers\\". On the one hand, when I was in high school, I had fallen into the trap of \\"group think\\", believing that the football hero or cheerleader was the best you could be, worthy of hero worship, etc. The other hand, however, now realizes how shallow those beliefs were and wishes more high school time had been spent seeing the real worthiness of the unrecognized heroes amongst us.<br />One thing Grisham does in \\"Bleachers\\" is to make my stomach churn. Remember all the favors the outstanding sports players and rally squad received for doing less than you or others and how you wanted to be on the receiving end also? The book rekindles those memories. That's why my stomach churns.<br />\\"Bleachers\\" is not at the top of my list for Grisham favorites.	2004-01-15

Some say yes, while others think it has only changed for the interim.<br />How far do we dare go before we have gone too far in regard to preemptive action, as a means of protection?<br />In \\"The Teeth of the Tiger\\", Tom Clancy presents a clandestine method of countering terrorist activity by interfering with their line of command and their supporters. Unfortunately, the story ends before we know, on a long-term basis how effective this method was.<br />As in prior Clancy novels, this one also has several groups of people located in various parts of the world. And, we bounce around from location to location as some interactions take place among various groups via email, while others are face-to-face encounters. One of these groups includes Jack Ryan, Jr. (who is all grown up now) and two of his cousins.<br />My greatest criticism of the book is that the ending of the story could have been better. In fact, it could have been much better. Actually, I'm not sure the story ended - but I can't find any more pages.	2003-11-10

When I began the book, \\"Sin Killer\\", I thought, \\"What's McMurtry doing here?\\" This is a strange story about a group of people traveling west, via the Missouri River. In this saga, the people do things you wouldn't expect to be done, considering their circumstances.<br />The rich Berrybender family, for example, brings along their own wine \\"cellar\\". Of course when others find out about the wine being within arms length, some help themselves. Common sense doesn't seem to be an accessible entity for many of the passengers and you begin to wonder what's that all about, since it gets many in big trouble. I mean, this group is headed into the unsettled west. They are faced with unpredictable weather, varying and important conditions of the river, Indians, boredom, and other people they meet along the way. The passengers don't seem to be interested in the consequences of any of these circumstances and they end up paying for their irresponsible behavior. <br />That being said, the more I read the more enjoyable the story became. \\"Sin Killer\\" is a quick read and It kind of grows on you.

There is much to be learned by reading Queen Noor's &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;.<br />Lisa Halaby, born and raised in the US, had Arab roots through her father. So, in a way, Miss Halaby came full circle when she married Jordan's King Hussein and became Queen of Jordan. The king chose the name, Noor for his fiance, which in Arabic means light. And so, Noor Al Hussein, Queen of Jordan was the \\"Light of Hussein\\". And, indeed she was.<br />From the beginning of the marriage, King Hussein wanted his wife to pursue projects and activities in which she was interested. He held great respect for her talents and abilities and the way she used them. Queen Noor found use of her architectural degree in the various homes in which they lived, always trying to make the environment comfortable for all. <br />\\"Leap of Faith\\" presents the reader with a point of view, or should I say, another side of the story in regard to the mid-east conflicts. This memoir has caused me to scratch my head and say, \\"hmmm\\", on many occasions, as I read the book. For example, the long running conflict between Israel and Palestine is ever present during King Hussein's reign. Within these pages we are reminded that Israel is in violation of an UN resolution, so hmmmm. Another reminder from the book is that the US still has not signed the Land Mine Ban Treaty, another hmmmm. There are lots of hmmmms in regard to the role of the US in the mid-east.<br />King Hussein was a peacemaker and Queen Noor worked with him in his efforts. In spite of the pressing duties of the King, the family managed to find time together. When travelling, one or more of their children frequently accompanied them. There is a great picture showing the King and Queen riding a motorcycle on the desert, a recreational respite.<br />One of the things about \\"Leap of Faith\\" is it made me aware of other extremely important perspectives in regard to the Arabic culture. Things are not one-sided and we can all use continued exposure to our world from varied sources to help in our understanding of other cultures. This book is helpful in that respect. This is not the whole story, but a piece of the story.	2003-05-30

(no pun intended)	\\"The Red Tent\\" is a story of Dinah (Dee-nah) and her family. Parts of this story are pretty barbaric and bloody, having its roots in The Old Testament's Book of Genesis.<br />The beginning of the book introduces us to the idea of the red tent where we learn of its function as it relates to women. For example, the red tent is a place for women to gather and share their experiences, both personal and practical. Not only is history passed on within the confines of the red tent, but also the opportunity for learning is availed. Stories are told and songs are sung. The red tent is a place of childbirth and a gathering place for women's \\"monthly rites\\".<br />While I like the female support the red tent provided, the writing of Diamant is sometimes pretty graphic and repetitive.<br />The middle part of the book expands upon the complicated relationships between Dinah and her several mothers, her siblings, and her changing, tumultuous life. <br />Part three presents an ending that brings things together for Dinah that is as acceptable as the time-period allows.<br />For me, the story is too ruthless.<br />--There is a helpful family tree of the generations that aids in keeping track of the many names and relationships.	2003-05-22

It wasn't until I finished the book that I found there is a long series of \\"...In Death\\" books. There doesn't seem to be any significance, however, to my having started out at the end of the list.<br />There is a decent amount of suspense in this book and it kept my interest to the end. This story takes place over 50 years from now. The year is 2059 and Robb appropriately incorporates innovations we will probably have in our lives 50 years hence.<br />There are many appliances in this story that respond to voice command, computers that talk in pleasant conversational voices, droids to act as servants, and other futuristic concepts. If you have already read some of this series this won't be news to you but it was new to me and I liked it.<br />As you can imagine, many futuristic computerized devices are used in helping to solve this murder mystery. Seeing advanced versions of equipment we already have, and that works, is interesting. Not once did anyone have to re-boot a computer.<br />Robb takes a \\"side trip\\" from the mystery and while it does serve to fill in some history related to the characters, I didn't especially like being taken away from the main story.

Once you start this book, you won't want to put it down until finished.<br />Malika Oufkir's first five years were spent with her loving family. The next several years of her life were spent with her adoptive royal family. The King of Morocco wanted a live-in friend for his own daughter, therefore the adoption of Malika was arranged. When Malika was a teen-ager she was allowed to return to her family where she enjoyed being with those she loved. Shortly thereafter, in 1972, her father was executed after being accused of attempting to assassinate the king.  As if guilty by association, Malika, now 18 hears old, her mother, brothers, sisters, and two compatriots were exiled and spent the next 20 years in various prisons.<br />The background leading up to the exile of Malika, her family, and friends was indeed informative and educational. One staggering event in this story is that even though the parents agreed to the king's adoption of their five-year-old daughter solely for the purpose of providing a friend and playmate for the king's own child, there really was no choice in the matter.  In other words, the king rules. Frightening is the fact is that the guilt by association exile and imprisonment of these people started not that long ago, in 1972.<br />Briefly, as a teen-ager with her family, Malika  did enjoy an exciting and fun-filled time. For example, she liked to dress in the most hip styles of the time, sneak out of the house at night and head for a local night club for an evening of dancing, etc.<br />The meat of the story, however, begins with the exile. Living under horrendous conditions, which included lack of sanitation, lack of adequate food, lack of normal communication, this family persevered. Malika played a primary role in maintaining a will, not only to live and rise above their humiliation, but to escape their confines. <br />Beginning their confinement, the youngest was only three. He grew up in prison. All of the family was concernedfor him because he had no awareness of normal life. Through Malika's day to day, continued story telling, he learned much. Everyone looked forward to the story, which provided needed entertainment and a special camaraderie for these prisoners. It kind of reminded me of the \\"Arabian Nights\\", with a twist.<br />Confinement to separate cells constituted part of their prison time. This was a clever family, though, and being separated inspired creative ways to stay in touch.<br />Eventually a plan to escape materializes from the minds of these incarcerated innocents. <br />You, now, must read this story to see what happens...	2003-01-25

US	51906709	R2U7P1Z2N4RID2	0440235162	583323315	The Smoke Jumper	Books	4	3	3	N	N	For Love and Responsibility	The Smoke Jumper<br />Two of the best descriptors for this adventuresome story are love and responsibility. From the beginning of the book which dwelt more on smoke jumping, to the middle part where friendships and love continued to develop and grow, to the last part where we learn the importance that the skill of smoke jumping , of love, and of responsibility have in this book. I liked all 560 pages that Nicholas Evans wrote for \\"The Smoke Jumper\\".<br />While you would be misled if you thought this book is mainly about smoke jumping, that focus is present in the story's first 200 pages, or so, and then the characters go on to other agendas. This is a love story. It is also a story of responsibility. Both love and responsibility are revealed amongst the three main characters as well as in their individual lives.	2002-10-19

Added information in regard to some characters might have made the story more realistic and tied things together better for the reader.<br />As with other Margolin writings, this one has its share of blood and violence. However, the nearly unbearable, gut-wrenching terror is somewhat diminished in this book, and that is a positive.<br />If you like thrillers, you will enjoy the intense fear depicted in \\"The Associate\\".	2002-09-09

US	51906709	R2WQ4QFWLK28OF	0788754270	359050157	Scarlet Feather	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A book of struggles	The title, \\"Scarlet Feather\\", makes you want to read this book just to find out how the title originated. What a surprise to find out it is the combination of two main characters' last names. (The fly leaf even reveals that much.)<br />\\"Scarlet Feather\\" is a book of struggles. For starters, struggles exist between wives and husbands, between children and parents, between in-laws, between siblings and between those in various long-term and short-term relationships.<br />As the story unfolds, the ever-present struggle to succeed reveals strengths and weaknesses of the interesting collection of characters. For starters, two struggle to succeed in the catering business while one struggles to succeed being an attorney representing the underprivileged and another struggles with becoming a model. <br />Maeve Binchy has written several books, however, the only other one I have read is \\"Tara Road\\". Between the two, \\"Scarlet Feather\\" is the one I liked best.	2002-07-31

You know how some people start at the back of a magazine and thumb their way toward the beginning? Well, I am starting at the end of \\"Looking Back\\" by saying I didn't like the ending.<br />There were unanswered questions left in my mind regarding the various situations presented in the book. Leaving some of the characters hanging in the text doesn't suit my wants in ending an otherwise great story.<br />What is friendship, anyway? Belva Plain explores the friendship, which started in college, of three young women and continues into their adulthood. Differences in backgrounds provide interesting exchanges in regard to how each friend deals with similar situations. The friendship continues after college, however, as time passes each becomes more interested in things relevant to themselves. This friendship eventually reaches a point of change, rather than one of growth.<br />Like most of Belva Plain's other books, \\"Looking Back\\" is a book I didn't want to put down once I started reading. Some of the events in the story were anticipated, and then I had to struggle with potential outcomes. For example, even though I kept hoping a particular circumstance would or would not happen, the author generated enough uncertainty to keep me from knowing whether it would occur or not.<br />In spite of the ending, I liked the book. Whether you are a Belva Plain follower, or not, you will want to read \\"Looking Back\\".	2002-07-17

I really liked this page-turner!<br />While \\"The Insider\\" is the first and only book of Stephen Frey's that I have read, you can bet I will be reading some of his other writings. One thing I keep asking myself is, \\"In our financial world, do things like this really happen?\\" In lieu of the Enron and WorldCom Group fiascoes having been recently brought to light, the convolutions brought forth in this book truly seem possible.<br />\\"The Insider\\" is full of can't put the book down, page turning suspense. Prevailing greed, power, self-indulgence, corruption, and innocence are components of Frey's interesting characters in this thriller.	2002-07-16

Because the time lapse between books is considerable, Auel had to spend time not only reminding previous readers of past events but also enlightening the first-time reader of the series in regard to the characters' history. As a previous reader of the other four books, I welcomed the history. Through the characters' telling of stories, explaining something, and teaching each other, the reader is effectively refreshed and brought up-to-date.<br />Some of the many issues mentioned or addressed in the book are related to territory, mixed mating, survival of the fittest, birth control, abortion, homosexuality, the spirit world and jealousy. While some of these topics are more a part of the story than others, some are presented in a format of  `that's just the way things are'. In other cases, information might be shared between people in an educational manner or passed on in the form of an example. For instance, Ayla knew of a birth control herb and others are interested in learning about it.<br />In regard to detail, Auel's explanations of making various tools are right on target. She takes the time to teach the reader about making the multiple wicked lamp, the thread-puller, the spear-thrower and other implements, such as the wooden box.  On the other hand, her detailed descriptions of sexual encounters between Ayla and Jondalar appear, in my opinion, to be anachronistic and don't seem to fit into the story very well.<br />The Zelandonii way of including one's past ties and connections when making introductions is very informative. Some of these are very long and reading them over and over every time an introduction is made is quite taxing.<br />Jean Auel has stepped into the world of poetry in \\"The Shelters of Stone\\". The most powerful part of the book is the song/poem, \\"The Mother's Song\\", where the idea of creation takes on a new and dynamic position. Following the books format of long and detailed explanations, \\"The Mother's Song\\" is also long, but it gnaws at you to come back and read it over and over.<br />**There is a helpful list of characters at the end of the book.<br />**The Mother's Song\\" is also printed at the end of the book.	2002-06-09

Laura Hillenbrand has presented an intense, beautiful story full of love for ones fellow human being, love for a very special horse, and love to the max for the sport of horse racing and all that career entails.<br />The book, \\"Seabiscuit\\", is an interesting study in psychology, including not only interactions between people, but equally important, those exchanges taking place between animal and human.<br />Understanding the bond, the intense understanding, between Seabiscuit and man may or may not be easier if you are a pet owner. My pet, which is a cat and obviously nothing like a horse, certainly has her selective ways of communicating and mind reading. Because of my experience, I just kind of expect the animal to human bond.  <br />While I have never been to a horse race, and until I read this book had very limited knowledge related to horse racing, after reading \\"Seabiscuit\\" I am looking forward to my first experience at the track. That's how good Hillenbrand has presenting this story.<br />\\"Seabiscuit\\" ranks toward the top of my list for all time best reads. One minute it is heart breaking, and the next minute warms the heart to the soul. The book is exciting and informative and a page turner.<br />Wow! What a biography!	2002-05-07
