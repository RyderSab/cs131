Starting with the simplest case and showing what's faulty about it, the author develops an understanding of why it needs message digestion, public and private keys and either Kerberos or a certification authority.<br />A small part of the book is reserved for some mathematical expostions which do not go very far. Two case studies, one awkward, one profound, round off the book.<br />The term e-commerce in the title is somewhat misleading. The book deals rather with B2B, the other subcategory of e-business.<br />A possible audience for the book are people like me, who are supposed to know what excatly a digital signature is and therfore cannot really ask someone.	2001-08-06

The book assumes no previous knowlegde of software engeneering and shows the reader step by step of what elements software development consists. The spectrum of topics spans a range from recruiting the right people to explaining the workings of CORBA.   This wide range of topics implies not going very deep into each one. So one needs to read many additional books about each topic covered here. While dealing with Java and Jini the author could not forsee the new moves of Microsoft with it's .NET technology. So it would be interesting how the author would write about it today. Definitely outdated are the listings of software products, e.g. IDE's.   Missing are a lot of necessary diagrams for showing how to modell, communicate or visualize the software development process.   Overall the book serves as a handy introduction to software development, giving one the feeling, that one has now heard about all the relevant aspects involved in it.	2001-07-29

But who wants to see a code example for an ASP.NET page, when he is about to understand what .NET is all about? For a technical person the book is too superficial and for a manager it's too code based. Therfore the book could only help people who might have to develop for/in .NET in the future. But then, those people might rather go for a book, which does both: introduce them to .NET AND provide the technical details to perform the developement.<br />Still, the book is pleasant to read and by it's ironic style of humor it successfully hides it's strong ties with Microsoft.  (And, .NET seems to be an intersting technology).	2001-07-21

It starts with the vedic and upanishadic roots then treats Shankara itself, then shows the post Shankara development in the first part of the book. The second part of the book, &quot;present day shankaracaryas&quot;, deals with the twentieth century development and state of the organisation. Here I liked the description of the vidyapithas, the learning sites and religous centers of the organization. The author has visited them all and met the Shankaracaryas himself.<br />The presentation is quite encompassing. But something seems to be missing in terms of comparisons with other philosophical and religious trends during history, which must have influenced this particular tradition. Nevertheless, this treatise fills a gap in the history of the east Indian history.	2001-07-21

There are standard topics like the continuity of the teaching from Ramakrishna to Vivekananda and several non standard ones like the ten year law suit where the movement tried to show it was not Hindu but a religious minority. The author excels in carefully presenting the issues without own judgement but still presenting the needed details for the reader to judge for himself, and he also outperforms other writers by a subtle way of arguing, where a statement is considered from different view points before hinting at possible conclusions. The book may be especially interesting to people who would like to find a more analytic approach to the history of that movement without reading either propaganda or debunking about it. It has to be said, that the book assumes a certain familiarity with the movement to be fully comprehensible.	2001-07-03

This book together with &quot;The Blender Book&quot; (also from Amazon.com) definitely enable one to create impressive 3D graphics. This one is more pleasing to the eye while the other looks more like a textbook. But as the authors say, much more information is available on [...] where Blender has it's home. The chapters are: Quickstart, Using Blender, Mesh modelling, Curves and surfaces, Special modelling techniques, Materials and textures, Lighting, Animation, Particale effects, Python scripting (small), The interface, The buttons.

The book contains a lot of illustrations, but many of the color photographs are artificially colored and certainly not the newest. They had a lot of work to change the book from two to four colors and one can still see this. Maybe, their newest version: &quot;Brock's Biology of Microorganisms&quot;, also available at amazon.com, corrects this. Besides it beeing a propper text book, the main highlights come from nature itself which offers such a vast morphological and functional diversity in the micro world. The chapters range from general cell biology through viruses, genetics, industrial microbiology, immunology, medical topics (diagnostics, epidemics, diseaes) to bacteria and archaea. It's nearly too many topics to have them all statisfactorly presented. But since I knew nothing of those topics at all, the book proofed to be quite benifactory to me.	2001-05-09

X11/Motif can handle only callbacks for pointers to functions and not to methods. Besides a lot of instructive examples, the main issue of interest is to show how to make XT callbacks work for C++ methods. The trick is to give a &quot;this&quot; pointer as an extra agrument to the XtAddCallback function, concealed as an XtPointer (which is a void pointer). This still goes to a function, possibly a static function in a class, which then has to cast back the XtPointer and call the final method. The book is nicely made. Still, X11/Xt/Motif is a nightmare. If one has any choice, then the modern qt library is much much better. If one needs to use Motif, than books as this one are very helpful.	2001-05-09

He goes into great length while analyzing the logic behind it. Advaita Vedanta is also clearly presented.

I remember that after reading &quot;A Secret Search in India&quot; and &quot;A Secret Search in Egypt&quot; I was somehow fascinated by Paul Brunton and his tellings. But they were so unbelievable, that I droped him. In the present book Brunton is exposed as a total fraud. The autobiography about the childhood of Masson unfolds step by step how his family became involved and enslaved by Brunton. Althrough as a reader one may ask why such a dependency on such a betrayer may have been possible, it is still so that many people who are save from cults are prone to become victim to this one-person-cult kind of cult. It is shown in detail, how Brunton established his position of someone beeing advanced, close to the final goal of life. Then they had to follow his advices to get there, too. It also did then not matter, that other people thought it was all crap. They were just underdeveloped. Not everyone could understand and accept, that Brunton came from Sirius. Bruntons case is all too strange, but he found disciples, nevertheless. The book also contains Masson's way out of this missery. The absurdities of Bruntons teachings, further information from other teachers, also the confusions after the wrong third world war prediction and finally university saved Masson's mental life. The book is an easy reader, and one delves deep into the authors inner mental workings.	2001-05-01

The book introduces into nearly all aspects of UNIX one needs to know to deal with UNIX in general. Several topics need extra books if one wants to go deeper into the subject. But this cannot be otherwise, because UNIX is such a vast field; too big for one book. For instance shell or Perl programming need aditional books. For system administration of a particular UNIX one also needs more information. If the only UNIX one wants to master would be LINUX, then one could buy the LINUX version of it. And if one uses a particular distribution of LINUX, like RedHat or Debian, then there are versions of &quot;...unleashed&quot; even for those. The book is not thought for teaching how to programm on UNIX, although it explains the basics for compiling software. If one knows little about UNIX the book may positively surprise by the many topics covered.	2001-04-28

He describes the activities of that center from a cultural anthropologist's point of view. Unfortunately he has to to hide any actual references to people there, like for protecting himself from law suits or personal disadvantages within that center. Therefore the book seems to be rather artificial. The lengthy anthropological introduction wants to rise the level of the book, but following chapters do not fully utilize anthropology. So it's neither a real scientific book, nor an exciting real-life story. On the other hand, any book which helps to analyze religious groups is helpful.	2001-04-28

Vijnanananda only continued translating a Sanskrit text, if he meditated long enough to have a spiritual vision of the gods involved in the story (see small biography about him published by the Ramakrishna Order).  The Devibhagavatam is a full fledged Mahapurana out of the Indian time of collecting all available religous and spiritual material into the Puranas. The tradition is Shaktism, Sri Vidya, that means, that Devi the godess is the central principle and force behind this world, even behind the trimurti. Besides endless fights of the gods it contains other spiritual advice and hagiographies of saints. It's a spiritual compendium of the highest order (within Hinduism, of course). It is to expect that Motilal Banarsidass will also translate this Purana in it's series containing all major Puranas of India.	2001-04-28

The book might shock anyone, who believed, that Ramakrishna was a divine incarnation (which might not be too bad). Ramakrishna is depicted as a total lunatic. Much of his  behaviour would have to be explained rather by sexual problems than by divine fervour. It's clear that sexual suppression, as it is quite common in indian relgious circles leads to massive psychological problems. The author uses the same sources for his thesis as do the proponents of Vivekanandaism but replaces the spiritual component with a psychological one. When I read a few passages in the &quot;Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna&quot; after reading this book, I found that Ramakrishna was very much mistaken in the book under discussion. On the other hand, if the Gospel is not, what one commonly assumes it to be, a nearly stenographical account of the conversations with Ramakrishna, but rather a mystical hagiography, created over a period of decades, with one of the purposes beeing to make Ramakrishna holier than he was, then, considering the still many critical things in the Gospel, it could well be, that the real happenings were worse and a psychological analysizes of the present kind may make sense and help one to better process a possible influence through the Ramakrishna movement. It is just to hope, that more data will show up over time, for instance that the Ramakrishna movement will make publicly available the original diaries of Mahendranath Gupta.	2001-04-28

It lists &quot;all&quot; UNIX commands, the different shell commands for scripting and also covers other topics up to RCS (Revision control system). It is easy to find things like special features of shell variables or default environment variables.  It also compares different types of regular expressions of different UNIX commands. Earlier on I used it daily, but now rather as a refresher, for not forgeting seldomly used UNIX commands. What I do not understand, is why they increased the price of the book so much. The present edition costs at least double the price from what it cost six years ago.  But the the book is still well worth the money. As a UNIX admin or regular user one ought to owe a copy of it.

The value of this  commentary, I think, lies not primarly in it's elucidation of the Gita, but more in giving the advaitic commentator a chance to deal with different aspects of advaita, which otherwise would not have surfaced, if not the Gita would have provided all these topics. An advaitin for himself would probably not need much more than the statement: Sarvam kalvidam brahma.  Compared to the commentaries to the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad or to the Vedanta Sutras, one may have some doubts, whether the original Shankara was really the author of this commentary. The Dashnamis seem clear about it that Shankara was the author. In any case it's 100% advaita vedanta. The book is quite interesting to read, whether in this version from Samata Books or for instance the one from Krishna Warrior.	2001-04-28

Therefore those darshanas (=systems) are dealt with extensively and well. But Nyaya-Vaisheshika falls short. The book is easy to read and does provide valuable information about Hinduism.

Easy to read and clearly written autobiography of a woman, who's life led here from nazi prosecution during the second world war through many intermediate states to finally becoming a buddhist nun of theravada buddhism.   The english translation of the german original does not seem (to me) to be as good as it could be, but this should not be a reason not to read it.   One might like to know, that half of the book describes Khema's regular life and that spiritual features are only showing up rather late. After she described so many details of her regular life, I was missing more information about her spiritual struggles after she became buddhist up to the point when she gained deeper meditative insights.   The entire story is written from a very detached point of view. Maybe a buddhist ideal, but rather caused by Khema's experiences during the war.   Nevertheless, the book is a great reading and one learns a lot about her times, herself and how a spiritual life can turn regular life upside down.	2001-04-15

This is not always done in practice, because one has to deal with systems behind firewalls and at most a halfway new perl installation. But once one has the choice, it's good to go for the CPAN modules. The book selects a few of those to demonstrate the case. The author is meticulous in explaining the examples. But he is not a perl hacker, so he does things of the sort: $x = $x ? $x : $y; where one would use: $x ||= $y; and many other things which twist a perl hackers brain. But by the choice of the topics including SQL and LDAP etc. he will help a lot of sysadmins.	2000-10-22

At the time of the Perl 4 book, there was nearly no alternative. Now we are flooded by Perl books and many are great. Nevertheless, this one remains the &quot;standard&quot; Perl guide from the master himself. They don't comment on why Randal Schwartz left the authoring team and has been replaced by Jon Orwant. The book has now over 1000 pages and is printed on good quality paper. The organization of the chapters is much better. Since Perl can do so many things, one book is still not enough to cover each topic extensively enough. I wished some more explanations about recursive regular expressions, for instance. But on the other hand they know this and therefore recommend the online documentation (perldoc ...). Some examles in the book are somewhat tricky, so that one has to use the brains. Whether this is good or bad must be judged individually. The parts and chapters are now as follows:<br />Part I: Overview. 1.) An Overview of Perl, Part II: The Gory Details, 2.) Bits and Pieces, 3.) Uniray and binary operators, 4.) Statements and Declarations, 5.) Pattern Matching, 6.) Subroutines, 7.) Formats, 8.) References, 9.) Data Structures, 10.) Packages, 11.) Modules, 12.) Objects, 13.) Overloading, 14.) Tied Variables, Part III: Perl as Technology, 15.) Unicode, 16.) Interprocess Communication, 17.) Threads, 18.) Compiling, 19.) The Command-Line Interface, 20.)

Perl Culture, Part V: Reference Manual, 28.) Special Names, 29. Functions, 30.) The Standard Perl Library, 31.) Pragmatic Modules, 32.) Standard Modules, 33.) Diagnostic Messages.	2000-10-20

The book focuses on qt without applying C++ exception handling or the standard template library. It also does not explain too deeply the workings behind qt's callback system, but just, how to use it. After reading the book I could immediately make a GUI on Linux. Earlier it took me much longer to do the same thing with Motif. The qdesigner which comes with qt2.2.0 takes away a lot of work. The book also explaines other capabilities of qt than the GUI main topic (e.g. socket handling class, qt container classes, etc.).

A good English translation of an old hinduistic text of the shakta and vedanta tradition. The translator is a Sanskrit scholar who works for the Himmalayan International Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy, which has been founded by Swami Rama, who wrote a nice book about his travels in the Himmalaya. The text uses Sanskrit terms frequently, but a glossary explains them all. The title Sakti Sadhana may confuse a little, because it's really just the translation of the Tripura Rahasya. The book consists mostly of teachings of Dattatreya about Vedanta with a touch of shakti. Carefully read it may contain some hints for the spiritual path. The book will be of best value, if one practices some form of Hinduism.	2000-09-24

It's tempting to believe him, although a certain shallowness calles for reluctance. But now, this emotionally deepgoing book leaves him standing naked in front of the truth.

For a possible reader of the book is should be said at least, that the author was a longterm pupil of a pupil of Ramana Maharshi and finally became a pupil of Ammachi.

He's a very intellectual person who also  spoke several indian languages, including Sanskrit. Contrary to the usual  spiritual seeker, he tried to understand and criticaly analyze everything  he encountered in in India or Hinduism. Naturally he made some enimies, but  also friends.<br />The book is very valuable for giving one insider  information from the monk's life, without any of the usual covering of not  so good things. So one learns about the Ramakrishna order as well as about  the sannyasi's life and about the Indian philosophical education. The  information provided here is now forty to fifty years old, and some of it  may be of rather historical value, but of value never the less.	2000-07-29

Single classes were never a problem, but multiple inheritance, was. Even in linear inheritance it was not easy  to see, where the object data of the superclasses would go. Things are  clarified here. The book also explains OOP as such, which is a good for  learning or repetition. The author seems to be extraordinarely versatile in  perl hacking and shows every detail of sophisticated use of perl OOP.  <br />Although the book is perfect, besides the typoos (, but there is an  errata page on the www), one wonders, whether perl is the ideal language  for object oriented programming. It becomes once more clear, that perl is  the most powerful language, but also the most complicated one. If one would  apply the &quot;tie()&quot; function regularely, then nobody could read the  code any more. Despite that, the book is needed, because perl is now  everywhere, and it can only be good to master it.<br />The chapters of the  book are: 1.) What you need to know first (an object-orientation primer),  2.) What you need to know second (a Perl refresher), 3.) Getting started,  4.) Blessing arrays and scalars, 5.) Inheritance, 7.)

They are based on  hinduism but use christian und buddhist terminology, as well. The book is  very helpful if one practices hinduism.

It's stuffed from beginning to end with one mantram after the other, each in Sanskrit, first in the Devanagari script,  then in Sanskrit but transliterated and then in English. Among the mantrams  one finds for instance the thousand names of shiva, the arati etc. There  are few small photographs, which show mudras needed during the pujas. But  if one does not know pujas from personal attendance, it's difficult to use,  understand and apply those mudras. There are also a few Yantras.<br />So the  book is to recommend to everyone, who practices any form of Shaiva sadhana,  independent of the philosophy. Pujas are not explained in this book, rather  one gets the mantras for it. But one can use the mantras without pujas, as  well.	2000-07-01

This Swami seems to have had a very &quot;rich&quot; life.  Lot's of travels and deep spiritual insights. One would really like to know  more about him, but since he was not in the limelight, nearly nothing has  remained about his pilgrimages. Nevertheless, it shows one, that there are  great souls out there, even if nearly unknown. In the later part of his  life he was a pupil of Swami Muktananda, and one learns here, that  Muktananda would have liked Prakashananda to become his successor,  Prakashananda declined, and therefore Chidvilasanda and Nityananda have  been choosen. As we know from other sources, Nityanda left the  &quot;position&quot;, so nowadays one hears only about Chidvilasananda,  when it comes to SYDA Yoga. But Swami Prakashananda was a man of his own  and basically a Shakta in his Temple Sapta Shring. The book is short, but  touching and worth reading. The author lived with the Swami for eight years  and tells the story without bringing himself into it, which is quite an  achievement. Thank you Titus:-)	2000-06-29

But the book is rather mediocre. The first part is the biography, then a small section about her particular spiritual states and then a  section of reports of devotees. The main purpose of the biography is to  claim the status of an avatar for Ammachi. It shows inummerable problems  during the childhood of Ammachi and how she overcame those either with  continous sadhana or with miracles. Since Ammachi is shown as beeing above  all human feelings and behaviour one cannot really identify with her while  reading the book, and even less so with the other actors. From several  people I know, I've heard, that Ammachi is an outstanding person. And it's  definitely good to read about her life, if one is interested into her or  her message.	2000-06-27

She asserts over and again, that she is the hinduistic devine mother and that she is bringing down the light of paramatman. There is no hint or proof of any kind, which  supports her statements. There are some photographs of her, which still  seem to show, that she attained some mystical depth. The concepts  are  simplistic hinduism, although the bringing down of the light of paramatman  makes not that much sense. Normally one says in hinduism, that the problem  is not, that the world lacks light, but that we do not comprehend the world  propperly. There is another strange teaching about some white and red lines  on someones body, which, as is explicitely stated have nothing to do with  the kundalini shakti nadas. Because she prefers to teach without words,  it's rather difficult to clarify such topics. The book will probably only  make sense to someone who has met her personally, so that he can interprete  it in the right way. For me it was too fancy.	2000-06-15

It also deals with questions like, how the organisation  compares to other hindu groups in America, what the typical member looks  like (, although this is based on too spare materials,), then what of the  movements teachings appeals to western people etc. Highlights are topics  like schisms, or the exclusion of of a swami from the organisation, who was  a direct disciple of Ramakrishna. Then the many deaths of hartatacks of  swamis, even one bombing. Although a scientific book, it reads nearly as  easy as a novel. The number of facts Jackson has collected is amasing.  Since he knows so much about the movement he can afford to write complitely  unemotionally about the topic. Some of the critical statements he has  hidden in the notes, probably for not totally offending the swamis. It has  to be said, that this is not a spiritual book. The author avoids any  spiritual statements. It's after all a history book.	2000-06-13

Eliade meticulously analyzed the indian scriptures and  commentaries on sankhya and yoga and presents yoga as a huge, complex and  precise system of practice and philosphy with the goal of kaivalyam  (libration).

The book: Presenting hinduism, buddhism and tantrism in a colloquial way. Main weight is on hinduism which is presented according to the kama, artha, dharma, moksha  pattern. The tendency is to eulogize hinduism, which is not typical for an  indologist. The author has a good writing style and shows a lot of his  knowledge in this book. He could not finish the book during his lifetime,  so the part about tantrism had to be completed according to his notes by  others. If someone does not like vedanta, the book may seem to be onesided  to him. For me, this was just the right side.	2000-06-11

He trained himself to sleep less and less, so that he could learn in the night. That paid well in terms of producing a knowledge which has seldomly been reached  by a historian of religion. He especially knew about similar things in very  different religions, so that he saw parallels, where nobody thought about  it before. He wrote novels as well as religios history books, including the  well known &quot;Yoga, Immortality and Freedom&quot;.<br />This autobiography  covers the most interesting part of his life, but does not make it to the  end, which has the effect, that no one knows, what happend, when the woman,  he loved in India visited him later in life in Chicago. That's quite a  story, because of who the woman was and because of the shaking novel about  the affair. The biography covers his Romanian time and the time in India.  He writes very openly not hiding unpleasant things. He tried both, to  understand indian religions and to live it. The science he did, but trying  to live it with Dasgupta and within the Shivananda ashram, both ended in  stories with women. With Dasgupta he was to study, but also he wanted to  live like a hindu and in the ashram he wanted to practice yoga. Later he  became a professor of history of religion at the university of Chicago.  It's now some time, since I read this biography and my comments are not  propperly weighted, but I can still say, that Eliade was a fascinating  person and did good writing and he knew nearly everything.

Good idea, nicely done. Only the interviewd people, except the son of Papaji, seem to be rather brain-leaky. One may like it, if one likes the non religious aproach to  spirituality. But even then, it sounds too easy, that one just walks in  with a guru and realizes the highest spiritual truths, then soon becomes a  spiritual teacher and would have reached the end of wisdom. So I'd take the  book as an example, how it should not be, but it's hard work, to figure out  exactly whats wrong, because it sounds quite authoritative and unrefutable  at certain pages. It's just simple interviews, but their omisions imply a  lot which needs rethinking, (which, I think, is good:-).	2000-05-15

I bought it to be able to follow the thoughts of my doctor. Since one needs quite some background knowledge for this purpose, I had to choose  some very comprehensive book. But of course, even with that many pages, a  single book cannot cover medicine. One still needs the dedicated books  about the topics and then even dedicated books about some disease. It never  ends. But then, who has the time for it?

It's comprehensive and technical high level. But I doubt that it is pedagogically ideal. In the 3.Ed. he removed  the reference, which I miss. Instead he added the standard template  library, which is a great tool.

Since nawk is the only thing besides KSH which one has available on every UNIX system, it is absolutely essential to have a good  handling of it. At many places one is not allowed to use Perl/Tcl/Python,  but AWK they cannot take away, because the system needs it. And this book  is the only one which presents awk in it's full power. It contains a  concise reference at the end, which is very helpful. Although gawk can do  more and has a nice book, it is so, that if one can install gawk, one can  as well install perl. So I think, that gawk, as far as it can do more than  nawk is useless. But it's not useless below, because then one can programm  nawk on linux as a preparation to use it on some UNIX server. This is  important for the book to choose. Because a gawk book contains many nice  things which are not available to the nawk programmer.	2000-05-14

But then I found, that most of the  books from spiritual people were somewhat fuzzy and that one cannot easily  spend his time for both, meditation and scientific studies.

With Ramakrishna, the custom started, that disciples write down every word of a guru and publish it in a book. However troublesome that usually is, in the case of Ramakrishna it was a great blessing to mankind. Ramakrishna was  a god-man with deepest spirtual insights, and an enormous richness of  spritual diversity. At the same time, in this book, human ascpects are  shown as well. The book does not pretend a perfect world or a perfect  Ramakrishna. The time one invests into spiritual development is obvously  lost from investing into other things, like presentig oneself in an  optimized way. I'm sure, Ramakrishna wore no tie and would fail in a modern  management school. This is no joke, because many people do not beleive  certain enlightend people, because they behave not quite propperly  according to social standards. A reader of this Gospel has to be prepared  to be confronted with a strange, but extremely spritual, environment.	2000-05-14

When I  have to recommend a Python book to a newcommer, and I also want, that he  will become good fast, then he'll get this quick Python book. (And I have  proof, that it works:-).	2000-05-08

Zen has no history and neither does Suzuki. He is a steady point in a play of parents, zen masters, second world war, man slauther and funny american zen students. He  was a down to earth person but still a light house, a kind of a buddha next  door.  The book is half his japanese and half his american story, well  researched and well written and therefore to recommend throughout.	2000-05-08

With it's help I actually made programms for which I got money:-)	2000-01-21

Still it is not reaching up to the highest  branches of Python art. That would be the task of a massively revised second edition of the other Lutz  book: &quot;Programming Python&quot;. And it has to be said: Python is a  great language!	2000-01-09

Even if one programs with Perl/Tk or Python/Tk, still this is THE book for how to use Tk. With this book one can complete ones Tk-GUIs, so that they do, what one initially wished them to to. The  book is a good example of how to write a good computer book.	2000-01-02

Karmapa. Good autobiographical  reading. The author is austoundingly honest about all the strange things he  did on his way.	2000-01-01

A lot of illustrative pictures. The book is a sequal to Riding the Tiger, but Ole has now a clear program of establishing  Karmapas buddhism in the west. It's a down to earth but solid system of  tibetan buddhism. Ole's work is still growing and right now gaining  momentum with 17.Karmapa in Europe. So I'm looking forward to another  sequal of his biography.	2000-01-01
US	51243884	R37NB7SGMEWWX	1577330269	894442948	Rogues in Robes: An Inside Chronicle of a Recent Chinese-Tibetan Intrigue in the Karma Kagyu Lineage of Diamond Way Buddhism	Books	4	5	14	N	N	Good reading, lots of scandals	As had to be expected, institutional buddhism would sooner or later show it's dark sides, as well. So far it used to be commonly accepted that one only wrote with highest price, if the topic was buddhism unless the author  was a christian. But this book from an insider uncovers a lot of scandals  around the interesting topic of the redescovery of the 16-th Karmapa. One  must not beleive in reincarnation, for it's mostly a political thing. The  author himself beleives in buddhism as well as omens, but most of the story  is about down to earth fighting of a secondary lineage holder, to gain  maximum power by choosing a child on his own as the 17-th Karmapa. He even  manages to get the Dalai Lama on his side, which gives enormous momentum to  the tragic split in a tibetan buddhist lineage. It has to be said, that the  author is a follower of Ole Nydhal. But even if one disklikes a  motorcycling lama, one can at least say, that Ole Nydhal is an honest man,  who would not accept a fake 17-Karmapa. Good reading, lots of scandals!	1999-12-11
