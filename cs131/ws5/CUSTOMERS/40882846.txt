Reading it is like being transported to her parlor, as they gossip about the good and bad (mostly bad) of the men in their lives. <br /> <br />The book's primary strength is Satrapi's relentless honesty in reporting what she sees.  Weakness of characters as well as strength is portrayed.  What is essentially a book of feminine sisterhood across generations also highlights personal fraility.  <br /> <br />That said, the brevity and shallowness of topic make this significantly less moving and worthy than either Persepolis novel.	2005-10-09

As I started, all the talk of religeon, miracles and spirits was a bit much for a supposedly true family history.  The more I read, the better it got.  The history of how Mr. Villasenor's grandparents came to America and met is an epic of love, transcendence and overcoming odds.  If you can make it past page 20, you won't put it down.<br /><br />It would have been very easy for this to be a whitewashed view of the world.  Instead, the author confronts some of the darker sides of his family history.  Many relatives spent time in jail.  Grandpa was a bootlegger.  Many of his great-aunts and uncles were jealous at the best of times, and awful at the worst.  Yet somehow a great story emerges.<br /><br />I can only imagine the effort required to produce this book.  Mr. Villasenor, your effort was well worth it.	2005-10-09

It isn't the smartest that succeed best, it's the people that can understand and motivate others that go furthest.  It's fine and dandy to say that (maybe risky in an era of technology) but it's another to clearly describe why and what can be done. <br /> <br />In this book, which could be considered a primer on managerial psychology, Goldeman breaks down Emotional Intelligence into it's various components.  This topology should create a bunch of \\"Aha\\" moments, even if the reader is not left convinced of it's completeness. <br /> <br />The book claims to be storng on measurement, though here is where I disagree.  It is possible to look at someone and say, \\"They have it\\" but the quantitative aspects of emotional intelligence lag the quantitative.  (Similar to measuring analytical intelligence, but the problems are even more acute here) <br /> <br />In summary, it's not perfect, but if it gets you thinking about news ways to measure intelligence, it is a worthy read.	2005-10-02

Fishman covers two sides of the China story.  First is the upside of their strength.  Labor that is nearly free allows China to undercut capital-heavy US in supplier cheaper goods for Wal-mart and the rest of the world.  China then buys the equipment of their bankrupt competitors on the secondary market, and their productivity increases.  A country of small businessmen are on the move. <br /> <br />Fishman also covers the negative.  Decentralized government makes it difficult for the central powers to enforce intellectual property rights.  Rampant copying.  Pollution coming from the insistance on pushing cars.  Indeed growth is coming with a price. <br /> <br />The book comes out remarkably balanced.  Yes there is a great growth story in China.  Yes, they are eating many of our companies alive.  But we are benifiting too, and China has to struggle with some downside of it's grand plans. <br /> <br />That said, the book does take a \\"Pay attention, this is the 2nd coming of Japan, but more so!\\" type of hype.  The reality is that China is important, but the world isn't going to end.  People are paying attention.  Less hype and more insight would've been helpful.  (But then again, I may not have found the book without the hype)	2005-10-01

Who better to create an \\"accidental\\" death than John Rain.  It's a busy ride, where the hunter and hunted are ambiguous, elusive loyalties are tested and you never know what turn is coming next.  The climax is strong, but leaves you breathlessly waiting for the next one.  (More Caffiene for Mr. Eisler - one a year is a fast pace, but we'd like them even quicker!) <br /> <br />Similar to previous books in the series, you'll finish this one within a day or two of buying it.  (I picked it up at a signing on Friday and finished it by the following Monday) It's just too hard to put down. <br /> <br />One suggestion for the reader is to start with book one (Rain Fall) if you're really interested in the series.  You can read this one standalone, but the history of Rain as well as the context of his personal changes play out over multiple novels.  This is not as purely episodic as the James Bond series. <br /> <br />I really hope someone acts on the option to put this series on the big screen.  Beat Takeshi - are you listening???	2005-06-28

(The more things change, the more they stay the same) <br /> <br />Three big stories are at play here.  First is the creation of the Mortgage Backed Securities business at Solomon.  Creating this market generated a ton of money on the street, and also highlighted both the challenges and gains from creating a new business from scratch.  It also demonstrated the knives pulled out in both stopping a new business from starting, and then fighting for scraps of credit. <br /> <br />The second story is of junk bonds - a vehicle initially created to fund less creditworthy companies, but eventually used to finance corporate takeovers.  This is the Michael Milken Drexel Burnham story.  This was the other major move of finance in the 1980s, though in reality junk bonds are not as awful as the hype surrounding them.  (Providing financing to less creditworthy companies is still a very valuable activity, and many funds did very well on this.) <br /> <br />The third story, and perhaps the most important, covers the conflict of interest between banks and their customers.  Many banks, traders and salesmen take their customers long term best interest to heart.  This is not neccessarily a given, and Lewis highlights his own experience in trying to walk the line. <br /> <br />Liar's Poker has earned it's place as required reading for all moving to Wall Street.  It should also be required reading for investors.	2005-06-28
US	40882846	RHS8CJ9P6FZAB	0393324818	346106080	Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Fantastic story about baseball and statistics	I ignored the hype of this book and held off reading it for over a year - I could not have been more mistaken.  The story of Billy Beane and the A's is a story of baseball's Little Engine that Could.  (I thought it was about the Yankees buying their way to the baseball title.  Whoops!) <br /> <br />Lewis takes you through Beane's background, a draft, subsequent player performance and ultimately how the A's performed.  Through it, you are presented with the history of statistics in baseball (starting with the prodigal Bill James abstract) as well as explanations for why the league is so against a data based approach.  Additionally, other attempts to apply more quantitative reason are explored, and their failures explained. <br /> <br />There are a couple public knocks on the book: <br />1 - The book is all about Billy Beane patting himself on the back.  I think this isn't valid - the picture of Beane seems very balanced. <br /> <br />2 - That Billy Beane is portrayed as a nutcase.  This is the opposite criticism of #1, but again I believe that the book is valid. <br /> <br />3 - All this baseball knowledge can't really be invalidated by math and statistics.  Actually, many fields have been overthrown by good mathematical models - quality control, finance and poker are just three. <br /> <br />4 - The statistical techniques are not properly applied.  This may have some merit.  Could Beane and friends have been making mistakes?  Is that why they're not doing as well?  Or are other teams just catching up.  The author of Freakonomics takes aim at Beane's over-reliance on hitting in his blog. <br /> <br />Desite these knocks, the book is a very interesting read for both baseball fans and people looking to apply statistical techniques to sort fact from fiction.  (Traders would be well suited to read this too!)  In a sense, this is an application of the Price Theory espoused in Freakonomics, even if the authors disagree on conclusions.  In that sense, it's about much more than baseball.	2005-06-28

What is bull****?  What isn't?  Why?  How does it differ from lying? <br /> <br />2 - At a secondary level, one might interpret the whole essay as bull****ing on bull****.  I suspect this was not intended as the purpose of the essay, but it is an interpretation. <br /> <br />3 - If you take it seriously, the essay is an attack on cultural reletavism - the idea that truth is not objective.  The author attacks bull****ters not because they lie, but that they have a complete disregard for the truth.  At least liars respect the truth enough to be false.  The bull**** artist does not care one way or the other. <br /> <br />It's a bit wordy in getting the point across (strange for a 67 page book!) but still worth reading.  It won't take long to understand it - honest!	2005-06-10

From List 31, 23 Quotes Regarding the 2003 Invasion of Iraq: \\"Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.\\" - Vice President Dick Cheney, August 26, 2002 <br /> <br />Some of it is a spin on religeon.

They're demonstrations of self-referencing paradoxical behavior in 3 different fields: Music, Visual Art and Mathematics.  If you can follow the ideas presented in Hofstadter's career building Pulitzer Prize winning work, consider yourself mentally stretched. <br /> <br />Godel's incompleteness theorum refers to itself in proving itself.  (If it's true, it can't be.  If it can't be true, it is)  Escher's art is self-referencing - follow the waterfall down until you realize you are back at the top.  Follow the stairs up and around a box, and get back to where you started.  Same if you go down.  Bach's music rises note by note until it's back where it started. <br /> <br />Attaching the same abstract idea behind each of these ideas is a fantastic synthesis.  For some it will seem obvious.  Others may consider it nonsense.  I consider myself lucky to be in the group that considers themselves stretched.  I don't get all of it, but enough to be glad I read it.	2005-05-26

The one thing he's good at is teaching himself Chemisty.  Upon his dad's advice, he joins the Boy Scouts.  While satisfying the Atomic Energy badge for his Eagle Scout requirements, he convinces himself that he can create a nuclear reactor in his backyard.  In the self-styled image of the Curies, he buys, begs, cajoles and improvises himself half the way there in his backyard tool shed.  It's a story that wouldn't be believable as a movie, so strange that it has to be true. <br /> <br />There are a couple issues with the book, though: <br />1 - The book really only has 20 pages of content about the bomb building.  It's like there wasn't much story beyond the Harper's article. <br />2 - The author presents a very negative view of both the atomic energy industry and the boy scouts.  I don't know if this is well founded or not, or if it was just filler.  Either way, as other reviewers attest, don't let it detract from your theory. <br />3 - The presentation of David Hahn was very one dimensional.  In the end we still don't know what is going on in his head. <br /> <br />All that said, the book is important in that it highlights a real risk to society:  If a high school kid could create a dirty bomb (granted not a thermonuclear explosion) then couldn't a group of college educated terrorists?	2005-05-26

The title story (I can't say titular, can I?) is of a college student's crush on the youngest member of a dancing troup.  Most likely autobiographical, it leaves the reader sharing Kawabata's youthful loneliness.  The second larger short story (there's no better way to describe it) is Diary of My Sixteenth Year, which covers the disappating love of a youth and his dying grandfather. <br /> <br />The remaining stories are much shorter, ranging from 3 to 10 pages each.  Birthplace is an interesting story of abandonment and leaving one's home behind.  Burning the Pine Boughs is as much about reading between the lines as reading what's on the page.  Oil is a deep work of overcoming childhood loss. <br /> <br />Three common themes permeate these stories.  First is the idea of an imperfect, sour or unatainable love.  Second is the idea that at least somehow many of them are autobiographical.  Third is that much is left unsaid in the stories.  In a sense they are a prose form of Zen art, where what is unsaid can be more important than what is put to paper.  Despite being distinct, one can read inferences between the stories (the hands for prayer in both Master of Funerals and Hands, for example) and perhaps that is enough to tie them all together. <br /> <br />Although Snow Country is commonly referred to as Kawabata's greatest accomplishment, these stories were more accessible and emotionally powerful.	2005-05-09

In reality, this is not his strongest work. Great columns, as well as some of his legendary lucid lines, are interspersed with nominally coherent rants against the political powers that be. Perhaps that is to be expected from him in an anthology of his newspaper writings.  <br /> <br />This is an important read for those very in tune to his genre.

This story of a Minnesota native visiting China was an interesting twist on the old tale.  It was enjoyable reading Mr. Holm's adventures (and misadventures - those always seem to be more enjoyable) as he visited China, before it became the trendy Giant.  Another variance on similar works is that Mr. Holm is a legitamite college teacher, not a wanderer using education as a visa.  As such, his writing is of a higher quality than usual in the genre, and he is more qualified to speak of the educational environment. <br /> <br />The observations are very interesting, especially as the experience is pre-Tienneman.  What's it like when the communists are watching your every move?  How do is teaching in China different than Minnesota?  What's Mickey Mouse mean over there?  The story meanders in alphabetic manner, perhaps also suggesting that our trip memories don't always follow a linear logic. <br /> <br />As the title would suggest, the strongest pieces of the book are the chapters of the return.  It is hard to identify personal tranformation in the midst of the journey.  You notice it when you come home crazy.	2005-04-30

Technology challenges, competitive threats (or dirty pool?), organizational challenges and who knows what else can come in the way.<br /><br />Despite what we know to be a crash and burn, it is hard not to be inspired reading this book.	2005-04-23

In this book, he reapplys his human insight into the tragedy that broke the belief in Japan's safe society - the Japanese sarin gas attack.  One guesses that Murakami goes through a transformation in writing the book, from one who writes aparts from the typical Japanese, to one who feels them as his own people. <br /> <br />The book covers the tragedy from many points of views - the victims surviving the crisis, the train station workers both coping with the problem and exacerbating it, the police attempting to solve the problem, and even the members of the cult.  It is interesting that in the second edition of the book, we are treated to a post-mortem of the members of the cult who somehow still believe.  In many ways, they are the most interesting characters, similar to doomsday adherants whose belief strengthens even after the event never materializes. <br /> <br />The book ultimately is a tough one to classify.  Is it cultural?  Psychological?  Historical?  With certainty, it is a very powerful book that testifies to Murakami's latent power as a writer across multiple genres.	2005-04-17

This is understandable given Japan's interdependent culture.  Mark Weston's Giants of Japan is one of the first that covers Japan from the point of view of it's great individuals.  The subjects of the book range from well known industrialists (Konosku Matsuhita) and leaders (Tokogawa Ieyasu) to lesser known writers (Fukuzawa Yukichi) and directors (Ozu Yasujiro).<br /><br />The book is good for many different types of people.  Those with a deeper knowledge of Japan can pick and choose from the individuals they wish to learn more about.  Those newly interested in Japan can read the book cover to cover to gain a broad knowledge of the history and people of Japan.<br /><br />This book does not attempt to provide a comprehensive Japanese history, or in depth view of any aspect of Japanese society.  There are other more suitable books in those genres.	2005-04-17

How does one judge a book like this?  If it is in accuracy of his beliefs, you are missing the point - he's no economist and his ideas range from provacative to awful, usually landing on either extreme.  And that's the point.   <br /> <br />In this book, he tosses out his ideas, making up for accuracy with volume.  Pabulum-puking liberals were the enemies, even if Mort was a card-carrying liberal back in the day.  People were shouting \\"Mort! Mort! Mort!\\" a decade before Jerry Springer's reinvention of the genre. <br /> <br />A good ride for fun, so long as you don't take it more seriously than it was ever intended.	2005-04-17

And it doesn't really get any deeper than that, but does it need to?  (And who knew oil platforms had the ecological side benefit of turning into reefs?)  <br /> <br />No grand moralizing, just a couple fun guys and their fish tales.

Many leadership books today trumpet two-minute techniques, fads, and processes to do everything but the job at hand.  Ulrich, Zenger and Smallwood describe how the \\"attributes\\" that other management books fancy are nothing unless they are attached to one of four types of results:  Employee, Customer, Organization or Shareholder. <br /> <br />Beyond stating the obvious, they also go into depth on identifying the attributes that really matter, versus those that just sound right.  They then delve into what it means to be a results focused leader, and a leader that builds other leaders. <br /> <br />Although the book is only five years old, some of the examples (Enron and Lucent) may seem dated, as the companies have falled out of favor.  Since it was written in 1999, that is forgivable.  The key ideas and concepts still hold strong.  This is a worthy addition to any leadership library or reading list.	2005-04-04

The story is about a going-nowhere band, a disgruntled shady executive, a couple cocktail waitresses, a couple retirees and the Miami mob in a mad-cap adventure off the shores of Florida.   <br /> <br />There can be many criticisms levelled on the book (the sex, language and graphic violence to name three) that make it depart from the Dave Barry that we are used to.  That keeps the reader off balance and wondering - is this a satire, a serious book, or just comedy?  In the end, you're left laughing at both the direct story as well as the genre he parodies.   <br /> <br />It's a light read, and if you don't finish it on a weekend afternoon, you really are too busy.	2005-04-04

Indeed - his suggestion that \\"one big move\\" is the best way to long term advancement is both counter-intuitive and against his own self interest.   <br /> <br />Definitely a great read that has survived the test of time.

It contains much of the history and lore of the great American country, and goes a long way in explaining the context and style of the company. <br /> <br />The downside is that Procter & Gamble is viewed stricly through Rose colored glasses in the book.  Perhaps that is a sign of the times (in the early 80s, P&G could do no wrong) but to really understand a company in depth you need to know the downsides too. <br /> <br />Procter & Gamble deserves it's story to be told somewhere between the extreme of this book and the slam-job in Alecia Swasy's Soap Opera.	2005-03-31

Others find it just as easy to love him.  How many rebuttals start with, \\"Dershowitz says...\\"  The truth on him may be somewhere inbetween, but this book is certainly one of his better works.    The case for Israel was written in response to a seemingly one-sided propoganda case against the idea of a Jewish state - Israel.  The book is organized around 33 questions related to Israel, such as \\"Was the UN partition plan unfair to Palestinians?\\" and \\"Has Israel Denied Palestine Statehood?\\"  For each question, the author documents the accusation, the occusers, the reality, and his proof.  The last point is most important, as Dershowitz is both a legal scholar and expert on regional politics.  The book is well documented, and more than just another dose of propoganda or yellow journalism.    For those interested in Middle Eastern politics, this is a great read.  (I would suggest Thomas Friedman's \\"From Beirut to Jerusalem\\" as well.)	2005-03-31

That alone would make it a four star book, though perhaps not enough for a more mature audience. <br /> <br />On a second level, one is introduced to deeper moral issues (Example:  Justification of all kinds of attrocities - but taken from the point of view of the characters themselves.  Are the Basques good because we associate well with Le Cagot)  Additionally, the book provides an introduction to Japanese culture that is rapidly fading away.  (Who plays Go nowadays?) <br /> <br />Perhaps the most delightful aspect of the novel is how Trevanian pokes fun at himself and the genre he spoofs.  In the introduction, he advises \\"All other characters and organizations in this book lack any basis in reality - although some of them do not realize that.\\"  Later, he explains the lack of explicit sexual details with, \\"In a similar vein, the author shall keep certain advanced sexual techniques in partial shadow, as they might be dangerous, and would certainly be painful, to the neophyte\\"  While we make the book too seriously, Trevanian certainly doesn't.  Perhaps because this is art in art, with Trevanian being the educated and witty but cynical alter ego of University of Texas professor Rodney Whitaker. <br /> <br />In some ways, the novel was between it's time.  \\"The Mother Company\\" harks to both the conspiracy theories of the late 60s and early 70s, as well as the X-files military-industrial complex of the 90s and catering to the oil lobbies in our current decade.  The focus on Japan precedes the Japan bashing of the 80s and the Lost in Translation focus of the past few years.  That it was written in 1979 places it in an interesting historical context.	2005-03-31

The book mixes personal stories with regional history, to give both color and context to regional events.    The author brings a unique perspective to issues, as he was formerly the New York Times correspondent initially to Beirut and later to Jerusalem.  He brings an objective viewpoint to the topics at hand, which is noteworthy when most books take an extreme position on one side or another.  In addition, he presents an interesting history of the troubles in Israel and Palestine, proposing why certain peace initiatives have failed, as well as proposing an option that just might work.  Like many observers of the region, he mixes hope with a healthy dose of pessimism for a situation that always seems too complicated to be resolved.    Since the initial printing of the book, Friedman has achieved international acclaim as an objective expert on both globalization (the Lexus and the Olive Tree) as well as terrorism in the post-9/11 era (Longitudes and Attidues).  Perhaps the acclaim he has received in the current era is what brought about the return of his initial solid work.  The book certainly is as relevant today as when it was written.    If there is one book to read to better understand the subject, this is it.	2005-03-31

There are numerous tactics in the book for improving one's practice, but it is a couple theoretical points that have the most value. <br /> <br />First, the book describes the pyramid nature of the professional services firm, describing how the profitability of a firm is derived.  (A partner bills out the pyramid below him)  Therefore, the two drivers for profitability of a partner are how much he can bill his (or her) people out for, and how big the pyramid beneath her (or him) is.  There are many tactical points presented for improving these, but it really helps focus the energy of the partner to think about the two main drivers.  What about growth?  In and of itself, adding partners with their own pyramids will not help the profitability of other partners. <br /> <br />What good is growth, then, if it doesn't drive profitability?  Growth is needed to encourage top employees to stay with the firm.  A firm that is growing 10% a year has many more opportunities than one growing 5% a year.  This counterintuitive idea (growth is more important for career advancement than size) is a great cue for picking the right place to work.  If the growth stops, it is time to move on. <br /> <br />The book is near timeless - perhaps the only way time has passed it by is in the ownership structure of professional services firms.  At this point in time, many (most?) top consulting and financial services firms are public.  Does this change the assumption that growth no longer benefits the shareholders? <br /> <br />Any employee or leader of a professional services firm is well advised to read it!	2005-03-31

There is repetition of words, but perhaps that is symptomatic of the original.  The message of the story still comes through.

The version covered here is Seidensticker's. <br /> <br />The Tale of Genji stands out on numerous levels.  It is an onmibus work of fiction, potentially the world's first novel.  Certainly the first to stand the test of time.  It is a story set in Heian period, where one can see the differences in Eastern and Western thought through the social dalliances of Genji and his children. <br /> <br />It may be assuming a bit much to look for broader meaning in the novel, but the reader is left with a deep feeling of the ephemeral nature of happiness, and the feeling that \\"things were better in the past\\"  Indeed while people are lauded, it seems like there is never time enough for the great things in life, and the great romances so rarely meet their initial promises. <br /> <br />There are certainly several areas people can and have taken issue: <br />1 - This greatly lauded hero is a philanderer at best, and a pedophile at worst. <br />2 - The book is inconsistent and rambling, frequently making non-linear leaps in timelines.  Perhaps this is the result of multiple authorship. <br />3 - The last 400 pages or so (after Genki's death) seem extraneous, as if the author was surprised to be finished, so she kept going.   <br /> <br />The first criticism could be taken in multiple ways.  Perhaps this was just how the royal elite acted in the Heian period.  Or perhaps we are supposed to appreciate the irony of someone talking of best intentions and acting in the worst, all to the praise of broader society. <br /> <br />The second criticism may be partially due to difference in Japanese and Western thinking.  Indeed we are used to more directness.  Part of it can be written off as inexperience from a pioneering author. <br /> <br />I have no good answer to the third criticism, as I felt that at 1000+ pages the book was too long.  It could have just as easily been 300 pages.  But given the timeframe this was written, and that it was a genre creating novel, it is too much to enjoy Hemmingwayesque conciseness. <br /> <br />In summary, the book may be a little much for someone without a great interest in Japan or comparative literature.  But for anyone in the latter two camps, it is required reading.	2005-02-13

As \\"Meditiations\\", this is not a how to cookbook on management, or checklist.  There are no promises of improved customer service, or increased efficiency.  Rather, by reading them, your thinking about management will improve.<br /><br />Two examples on the meditations:<br /><br />1 - The Abilene Paradox essay talks about a family vacation to Abilene.  Nobody really wants to go there, but everyone thinks everyone else wants to go there, but is affraid to speak up.  The lesson is self evident, but the story conveys it in a manner much more memorable than a directive to \\"Create an organization with open communication\\"<br /><br />2 - The writings of Elliott Jaques.  Harvey introduces the concept of the \\"Requisite Organization\\", an idea developed by Jaques.  This highlights the imnportance of understanding complexity (as defined by the time horizon of projects one is capable of thinking of) and designing an organization where that is the key component to success.  That's a deep thought in today's quarter-driven business.<br /><br />Reading and pondering these meditations will make one a better manager and leader.

It is rare for the two to meet, but without resorting to complex math, Taleb explains how both exist. <br /> <br />Based on his background, one would think this is a book primarily about trading.  Quite the contrary, the concept that \\"People underestimate the importance of randomness\\" is also used to explain how poor performers can get promoted.  Taleb also explains how \\"black swans\\" (extreme random events) can be underestimated by even the best mathematical models. <br /> <br />There are knocks on the writer perhaps having a self serving bias, or being a little too confident of his own achievements.

Work is a political place, but most of the time, we see problems coming.  If someone stabs us in the back, usually we get a warning, but are complicit by not assertively contacting the person doing us in.  This idea of defeating poor office behavior through open and honest discussion is developed in depth throughout the book. <br /> <br />There are two downsides. First, this book perhaps has too much text for such a simple concept.  Although this is good reading for a fan of Jerry Harvey (I am one!) the Abilene Paradox is a much more efficient (more ideas, less words) introduction to his material.  Second, Jerry is perhaps oversimplifying the world.  Office politics is best beaten by open book confrontation of problems, but life sometimes is more complex than that. <br /> <br />That said, this is still a worthwhile read.	2004-12-30

Like most economic history, one would expect to be bored to tears.  The book adds a couple doses of financial theory (also \\"Ho Hum\\") and somehow manages to be a delightfully insightful and interesting read.  The 400+ pages just flew by. <br /> <br />There's lots of interesting historical annecdotes included: <br />1)  The bears who get killed for mistiming their predictions.  (The bull isn't done until the last bear is gored) <br />2)  How the Blodgets of the world were created by a system that encouraged cooking the books and an abdication of responsibility.  (Mahar covers the laws that created this environment, and those politicians that pushed for them) <br />3)  The ups and down of particular investors as they deal with the bull and inevitable bear. <br /> <br />In addition, several insights come out: <br />1)  Buy and Hold Equities isn't all that it's cracked up to be.   <br />2)  Not everyone belongs in the market.  Indeed, many investing professionals make their money on Wall Street, but invest it on Main Street.  (Harder to lose money on a house) <br />3)  Decreasing spending or increasing earning potential can go a long way.   <br />4)  It is easier to pick trends than timing them. <br /> <br />There are a couple attacks on her thinking: <br />1)  She cites the virtues of market timing, but market timing really isn't that easy.  If it were, we'd all be doing it. <br />2)  She cites many folks who called the end of the bull right.  In a sea of information overload, it isn't that easy to find these people and understand their arguments.  (There's always convincing bears) <br />3)  There are many instances of \\"If you only followed Xs advice from Day Y...\\" which is tough to check.  Is that a valid trend, or are the dates (especially the end dates) picked just to amplify a point?  (It's always possible to find a 5, 10 or 20 year period to prove a point) <br /> <br />That said, the book is an important one, both from a historical point of view, and to improve one's investing.	2004-12-30

But with all due respect to Mr. Twain, statistics really are important, so having this book to understand some of these techniques is vital. <br /> <br />Just take the lesson with a grain of salt.  The book is thin, making it an easy read, but the lessons of universe are not contained in it's pages.  Best to view it as the first class of Statistical Self Defense 101, rather than a master course.	2004-12-24
US	40882846	R1HSJQO1OP4BBZ	0451191153	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	5	8	10	N	Y	Howard Roark as Rand's ideal person	Fountainhead is Ayn Rand's novel introducing the world to her powerful concept of objectivism.  The protagonist is Howard Roark, the ideal objectivist man, who holds himself to standards above those commonly held by society.  He avails himself against medicority in the form of outdated schools, petty peers who get by purely on social skills, and a socialst organization bent on proving that everyone really is equal.      There are three criticisms frequently made against the novel:  1)  The characters are one dimensional, lacking depth.  To this I respond that Rand writes in the Romantic tradition, preferring extreme characters (whom we should strive to become) to clearly dilenate the battle between good and evil, rather than more complicated or in depth characters.  2)  The positions she takes are too extreme and unrealistic.  For this, I suggest looking at the timeframe.  It was the 1940s, and the US was just waking up to the horrors of communism.  Coming out of the 1930s, the US could have taken a dramatically more socialist turn.  As a wake-up call, this book needed to be stark.  3)  The rape scene is hardly becoming of an \\"Ideal\\" man.  I have no response to this criticism, as it is likely true.    Despite being perhaps 400 pages too long, and rather one dimensional, this still ranks as one of the most influential works of our century.  Many silicon valley execs praise the self-deterministic beliefs, and even our Fed Chairman is an admirer (though he's backed off many of his more extreme beliefs).  If you agree with the precepts, consider it fuel for your fire.  If you consider Rand a crackpot cult leader, read it to better understand your enemy.	2004-12-24

Naisbitt's methodology of tracking trends is perhaps not entirely scientific, but it is more precise than much of what passes as future watching.  Certainly we left the American century and are now entering the Asian one. <br /> <br />Naisbitt falls down in his timing.  He is entirely bullish about regional opportunities.  But what happened in 1997?  The regional financial contagion brought down much of the good times in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Thailand and elsewhere.  The Malaysian Multimedia SuperCorridor slowed.  Other development regionally took a backseat as many western companies pulled out. <br /> <br />Fast forward to 2004 (perhaps a more appropriate timeframe for Mega trends) and the wisdom is becoming evident again.  Shanghai and Bangalore are the world's boomtowns, and many other regional economies are taking off.  Perhaps he wasn't so wrong after all...	2004-12-24

Learning to Bow and You Gotta Have Wa are books of a similar vein.<br /><br />Twigger writes with painful honesty of his travails as part of the slacker generation that found it's way to Japan in the 90s.  He falls into Aikido as a way to impose discipline in his life.  We see the real think - the difficulty he has with an imposing instructor, how he copes with adversity, as well as his distaste for the visiting instructors tendancy to get into drunken brawls.<br /><br />In the end, the book is improved by the lack of grand revelation.  It is not one man's coming of age.  It is not about transcendence or vision.  It is about survival, and how someone learned about themselves (both good and bad) as they persevered through a difficult time.<br /><br />One downside is the title is quite a misnomer.  First, the impression the book gives is more of masochism (How much pain can one take?) and intensity than of a bunch of angry people running around.  Second, while Twigger is a gifted writer, you don't get much sense of him as a poet.  Indeed, calling him a warrior poet seems less accurate than viewing him as a lost sould finding direction and discipline for a year.	2004-12-23

Perhaps that alone is testament to the clear and interestling writing style of Seidensticker himself, one of the great observers of Japanese culture. <br /> <br />The story is much more than just about Tokyo, though.  It starts in Colorado, weaves through his introduction to Japanese language through the US military in WW2, and only then hits his life in post-WW2 Japan during the reconstruction.  It covers his introduction to Japanese fiction, as well as his translation.  Finally, the book wraps up with his return to US, and introduction to academia. <br /> <br />The book reads rather well for the first biographical (autobiographical at that) work of a translator.  Although Seidensticker made his name in translations, we also learn of his attempts at fiction and other writing. <br /> <br />Perhaps one complaint is repetitive word usage.  For instance, the word \\"eminent\\" is very overused for such an \\"eminent\\" translator.  I'd expect better.  But that is not nearly enough to stop anyone from reading these memoirs.	2004-12-23

Mark Plotkin writes a story of truth being stranger than fiction, as he recounts his stories in the Amazon jungle.  Experiments with halucinagens go hand in hand with the identification of rich sources of vitamin C. <br /> <br />We are also handed a primer in ethnobotany, the search for scientific basis of folk medicine.  Sometimes it's real, sometimes it's not, and just perhaps there's a spritual element too.  (Or is that the halucinagens?)  Either way, you're left with an appreciation for the decreasing pharmaceutical wealth of the Amazon.	2004-10-23

It's been said that most great champions have had to overcome great adversity.  This is the story of the adversity that Jens Pulver had to overcome.  <br /> <br />Jens, assisted by Eric Knauss, tells the story of a childhood raised by a loving mother and an alcoholic abusive father.  The sport of wrestling allows him to focus his anger, but he drinks away an athletic scholarship in idyllic Idaho.  Every time he almost gets out of the morass, his past comes crashing back. <br /> <br />The story ends with his Ultimate Fighting Champion title defense against BJ Penn, a prodigy who was a big favorite coming in to the fight. <br /> <br />The book contained much more emotional depth than expected.  Readers expecting a detailed history of Pulver's fights will be disappointed, however.  This is more about his personal struggles outside the ring than his battles inside the ring.  The other potential shortfall is that the story is still unfinished.  Since the book Jens has had a fall, and is the midst of a comeback.  It would be interesting to read his take on that as well.	2004-10-23

The story contains many cliches (Those that are free can't appreciate it...) as well as some insightful experiences of a bicultural individual struggling with an identity crisis.    The writing is very ironic, and I suspect this is by intent.  There are racist comments that are presented as naive ethnocentrism, or darker hatred.  But there's a message there about context...  We are all guilty of this from time to time, blinded by our own cultural views.  This doesn't make it excusable, but it does make it understandable, and the author does not hold herself above us in being guilty.  A less sinister show of irony is in the author's anarchistic friends enjoying the benefits of government holidays.      In the end it stands as an interesting work of \\"What happens next?\\" as well as a biting commentary on both East and West.  It will be a quick and entertaining read for those who read the first novel.  It lacks, however, the power of the original (or the Maus novel to which it's compared), and would not be as solid a stand alone story.  Despite that, I'll read Persepolis 3 when it comes out.	2004-10-23

Perhaps dressing in the outlandish fad of the month is part of a uniform for being in a group that dresses that way - membership created as such.  The mobile phone craze (replacing Manga, another fad) is interpreted as an exercize in proving one's group belonging.  In doing so, he also suggests that perhaps some of these beliefs about conformity are not to distinct to Japanese.  Perhaps their uniqueness is in fessing up to a more universal tribalism. <br /> <br />Very interesting reading for both those interested in contemporary Japan, as well as people interested in the nature of belonging.	2004-10-19

The book is written in three large chapters, containing each point of view. <br /> <br />Throughout the story, many issues are implied above and beyond the science fiction at hand.  Left brain/right brain difference are covered in the alien interactions.  The morality of putting one species over another is touched upon.  The difficulty of replacing an energy source are touched on - Asimov could have been predicting the oil crisis and resultant pollution impacts.  <br /> <br />At times when reading this book, I really felt, \\"So this is what a truly great writer is about...\\"  The prose was fantastic, the weaving of the three story lines was fine craftmanship, and the meaning broader than just the surface plot.  In many ways Asimov transcends the genre of science fiction in this amazing story.	2004-09-15

Despite a willingness to backstab each other for a jug of wine, you are drawn in to their fraternity, and cheer them on as the search for windmills to fight.  Although not as explicit as Cervantes, the mock gallantry in the face of adversity makes for an endearing tale.<br /><br />Although cited as a lesser work of Steinbeck's, it was certainly solid enough to keep me coming back for more.	2004-09-12

The follies of Norman Paperman, a New York PR guy running a hotel and bar in the Carribean, captures the dangers of chasing an obsessive dream.  The writing is solid, if stretched, but you find youself hoping everything works out for the best. <br /> <br />The book is at it's strongest when Wouk describes interpersonal relations.  He colorfully describes New York society at it's finest (at worst) as well as the society life down on the islands.  Capturing the protagonist at his failings makes for a deeper novel. <br /> <br />The downside of the book is the extended existance of Murphy's Law.  After the first hundred pages or so, each mistake or folly becomes predictable.  In that sense, I really wish the book had been shorter.	2004-09-11

I hope Konrath never writes a memoir!\\"  I'm glad that first impressions weren't lasting, as the quasi-autobiographical novel really does not have much that could be cut out. <br /> <br />The story covers the summer of 1992 for John Conner, as he struggles with a painful breakup, the possibility of failing out of school, perpetual money troubles, and the challenges of picking up women via computer 10 years before it becomes trendy.  Top it off with a diagnosed case of bipolar disorder, and you have a trying summer. <br /> <br />Although it helps to have lived in Bloomington to appreciate the precision of Konrath's descriptions, the book's deeper messages of alienation, struggle and coping with change make it appropriate for broader audiences.	2004-09-11

I consider Animal Farm a great treatise on the ills of communism from both a generic and specific point of view, and was hoping for many similar insights.  Communism's socialst critic writes penetrating stories and clear analogies, so I was hoping for the best. <br /> <br />Shooting and Elephant was a cutting view into the life of colonial police in India.  Indeed, that type of insight into human behavior and how people's behavior breaks down in groups is what makes Orwell strong. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there are many more situations where sections were cut out of books (yes, it's a reader, I should've know that before I purchased) where the original in it's entirety captured the points much more completely.  It's hard to encapsulate a great work like 1984 with an excerpt. <br /> <br />While Orwell is indeed a great author, I was disappointed by the disjointed nature of the collection.  His writing remains best captured in their original full length form.	2004-09-09

It is general in the sense that Orwell takes the reader through the cycle of what's good about the promise of social equality, as well as the power issues that make a dictatorship the wrong way to get there.  The specifics come from the close parallels between characters in the book and Stalin, Trotsky, the secret police and others.<br /><br />So what makes this book a classic?<br /><br />- Orwell was actually a very solid socialist.  His critique is not the type we see today where right wing bashes the left wing on all fronts.  He writes as one who understands and appreciates the goals of the left, but hates the methods used to attain them.<br /><br />- The book was well ahead of it's time.  Today everyone knows the evils of Stalinism, but even thirty years ago there was still active discussion about the pros and cons of the Russian economic system.  Written in 1954, Animal Farm called out an insidious leader and his corrupted system well before the rest of the West was on to it.<br /><br />- The book concisely captures the message.  A lazier writer could have written a 400 or even 1000 page treatise on the evils of communism.  In 144 pages, Orwell nails it.<br /><br />In summary, it's a genuine classic that deserves it's place on so many recommended and mandatory reading lists.	2004-09-09

The hindsight that allowed Geoffrey Moore to put a book out on tech investing adidst the high tech bubble is also the hindsight that allows me to pan it, so I can not claim any great wisdom. <br /> <br />The central concept presented in the Gorilla Game is that winners and losers in the technology industry industry are determined by the 800 pound gorillas.  The first company to become an 800 pound gorilla (Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, etc.) creates a long term sustainable competitive advantage by making platform decisions that favor themselves.  This concept is still very true today.  The companies that drive standards and create barriers to entry are the winners in high tech. <br /> <br />The challenge here, though, is the stock market has caught up to that idea.  For a short period in the mid-90s, the standard bearers were undervalued.  The pendulum went the other way, and they rapidly became overvalued by the end of the decade.  People who bought into the \\"I'll be safe with the gorillas\\" got burned with everyone else when the tech bubble burst.  Following Moore's investing advice would've cost you a lot of money. <br /> <br />Does this mean the book is worthless?  No...  It will still help you pick relative winners and losers (Microsoft, Cisco and Intel are all still around) and it is good as a management tool.  Unlike other markets where multiple winners can share the spoils (Many companies can make money selling soap) in technology the biggest really does have a huge advantage.	2004-09-04

Sounds painful and dull, but perhaps beaurocrats get such a bad rap because they are operating ineffectively.   <br /> <br />Stratified Systems Theory is a hard-core scientificaly derived theory on who has the adequate personal capabilities to be a manager.  The key concept is that leaders should be given responsibility based on their ability to think about long term complex problems.  All other management competencies (emotional intelligence and other soft skills included) are secondary to this ability.  It's a hard concept to handle, but backed with sufficient data. <br /> <br />Many secondary implications are discussed too.  How should one promote individual contributors?  What's the effective span of control a manager can have?  How does one handle organizational conflict?  Should one override a subordinate in a staffing decision?  All these questions are relevant to today's manager, and it is good to have a theoretical foundation to think about these questions. <br /> <br />There's two downsides to the book.  First, whenever there's a book stating, \\"The whole world is wrong and headed to hell in a bucket!\\" I tend to greet it with skepticism.  Secondly, although Jaques has a tremendous amount of impirical work supporting his positions, it is not clear if the ability to think long term is the driving factor of personal performance in todays world of shifting organizations and personal loyalties. <br /> <br />Even if you disagree with half of what Jaques says, the originality, insight and rigor put into such a soft field makes it well worth the read.	2004-09-04

First is the historical component of the company - the creation, fall and rebirth of Clif bar.  It's told first person from the founder's view from the trenches, and you join him in the trials and tribulations of an entepreneur. <br /> <br />The second theme covers the values of the company.  It talks about concepts like mapping the road less traveled, and living your values as a company.  It's this section that really makes you hungry for a Clif Bar.  :-)  It also demonstrates how both the passion and neglect of a leader is reflected in the company.

It held great promise, as I've an active interest in Richard Feynman, and have been reading several \\"find yourself\\" books, so a story that connects the two should have been perfect.  Should have.    The annecdotes of dealing with Feynman as he coped with cancer were touching, and Feynman's downsides (example: Feynman's reluctance to help former students of his after an obligatory two year period) were uniquely captured here.  Despite that, the writing on him and the relations were very thin.  Indeed, Murray Gelman had as big a place in Mlodinow's life.    In the end, we're left with a story of a sharp mind (Mlodinow) who struggles with his desire to be a physicist.  Unfortunately we are given too little on both his final decisions as well as the titular interactions with Feynman.	2004-09-04

Jonas has aged, had kids, and, along with his wife, entered a serious midlife crisis. <br /> <br />The book carries the same formula of biology and evolutionary lessons mixed with horror and action scenes.  At times the action sequences defy beliavability, but they keep the overall pace of the book moving rapidly.  There's also more color into the lives of the main characters.  By the end of the novel you feel more insight into their personalities than the first two books combined. <br /> <br />Good story in all.  I'd relate this to the first like I'd relate T2 to the original Terminator movie.  The first was more of a horror story, while the latter has even more Hollywood elements (more kid involvement and action scenes) in it.  The same is true here.  With that in mind, I gotta admit I wanted to see what would happen if one of the Megs duked it out with a nuclear submarine. <br /> <br />Enjoy!	2004-09-03

Megaladoon's were real sharks that existed in pre-historic time.

The answer is a horror of enormous proportions as the goliath sharks are unleashed on a modern environment unable to take them. <br /> <br />Mix an archeology and evolution lesson from the author, and you get a much better than usual horror story.  By the end you'll be asking yourself, \\"Could it really be true?\\" <br /> <br />Good story in all.  I suspect it was written with a movie deal in mind, as the action sequences get a little bold and over the top.

Thompson	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A worthy history of Gonzo and the good Doctor	This unauthorized biography artfully captures the life and times of Hunter S. Thompson, the father of Gonzo journalism.  It covers his early years in Kentucky, his early life as a foreign correspondant and his later collaboration with the artist Ralph Steadman.<br />The book generally presents Thompson is a positive light, but it doesn't pull punches in how Hunter treated his wives, or the fictional aspects of Gonzo journalism.  Indeed, he cites examples of &quot;If it's not true, it should be&quot; and where Hunter writes the most truthful political articles, even if they are not the most accurate.  Indeed, much of the biography is about how Hunter inserts himself into the story, in essence creating it.  This act of &quot;the observer impacting the observed&quot; is both a key problem with science, and a key pillar of Gonzo journalism.<br />After reading the book, you will in turn read his other works with more insight.  Where does the author come from?  How much is fact versus fiction?  What is his spiritual link with Hemmingway?  I hope you enjoy the answers as much as I have.<br />The one weak point is that the book has aged.  Hunter S. Thompson has re-emerged in the past several years with more brushes with the law (shooting his assistant) and a job writing for ESPN magazine.  It would have been interesting to get Mr. Perry's viewpoints on this.	2004-06-06

Somehow it's true!	This accounting book covers everything we wished we learned in our introductory accounting class, namely \\"How do we know if the managers are lying to us?\\"    In a very easy to read format, the book groups accounting tricks into seven major accounting shennanigans and then cross-references them to a variety of accounting scandals.  In the end, you're left with a deeper understanding of the major ways people can manipulate financial statements for their own game.      This is a surprising interesting book given how dull most accounting texts are.  It's appropriate for novice investors and accounting students as well as more advanced accountants.  The book practically reads itself.	2004-05-31

The story starts with the problems created in Japan's real estate bubble, and how they left Japanese banks saddled with poor performing loans.  The story zeroes in on the problems that caused LTCB to fail.  It then covers the revival of the bank with the assistance of an American private equity fund, and the struggle of the new managers to play within the constraints of the Japanese system.<br />This book highlights several issues with reform in Japan:<BR>1)  The business problems are never what they seem on the surface.<BR>2)  There are deep cultural issues at play that transcend mere language barriers.<BR>3)  Working on a turnaround in Japan is a tremendously challenging ordeal for people on both sides.<BR>4)  There is no simple economic or cultural solution.<br />So was it a success?  Well, depends on how you define a success.  Collins and Flowers put a $1.2 billion in the bank.  The government accepted $10 billion in returned loans, on top of a recapitalization.  $27 billion in bad loans were disposed of.  The bank winds up with a projected market cap of about $10 billion.  So was it a transfer of public wealth to private wealth?  Or a neccessary step in reforming the banking system?  The reader is left to decide.<br />If the book has one shortcoming, it's the presentation.  I certainly enjoyed it, but the focus is much narrower than the title of &quot;Saving the Sun&quot; would highlight.  While broader banking issues are tackled, the book centers on one bank and a small group of investors, and no broader Wall Street/Ginza tie-ups.<br />In all it is well worth the time for anyone interested in the Japanese financial sector.  It is one of the strongest books I've read in describing the economic situation in Japan, and melds cultural and antropological issues into describing the problems and solutions.  Very well done!	2004-05-23

Today we view Martin Luther King Jr. as a saint, and a model of what the human spirit can achieve.  In his day, he was viewed by many in the South with fear, hatred and loathing. <br />It is easy to view this situation in hindsight, and assume that everyone was just ignorant.  Oates writes of the complex history, the battles within and outside &quot;the movement&quot; and how divided the nation was at the time.  Oates also does not shirk away from many of Martin Luther King's personal weaknesses.  In this sense, he humanizes the great leader, instead of canonizes him.<br />In the end, I am left with three conclusions:<BR>1 - Martin Luther King Jr. indeed found a way to overcome hatred with love, and in doing so helped America avoid a race war.<BR>2 - The message of civil rights was both religeous and personal.  Despite today's views of the right being the party of religeon, in his day the southern liberal movement was galvanized in the church.<BR>3 - Despite this, he was a flawed individual.  His human weakness does not diminish his accomplishment.<br />The book is not light reading.  Read it.  Let it soak in.  And comprehend.	2004-05-16

Frank Herbert knocks it out of the park in this masterpiece, the first and best novel in his Dune Saga.    Throughout the 1000+ pages, Herbert develops multiple stories and themes, seeding the ensuing series.  On the top of the plot, there is the drama of a galatic struggle fighting over Sprice, a precious commodity only found on Dune.  Intertwined in this are themes on politics, love, religeon, addiction and family values.  (One could say the scope is almost biblical in it's breadth)  Similar to Tolkein, you are still left feeling that there is much unsaid.  Perhaps this depth is what marks Dune as a masterpiece instead of escapist fiction.    If you've seen the movie, you will get much more out of the written form than you did in the movie theater.  There's only so much than can be displayed in a few hours.  The Hollywood vision will contain plot spoilers, but really misses much of what is going on underneath.  (Dune is about much more than action and a fight over a scarce resource)    When I purchased the book, I really didn't know what I was getting myself into.  I was doing a lot of flying, and preferred thick books - 1000+ pages or more were best.  I was most pleasantly surprised at the experience these pages provided.  Much more than just filler for several long plane trips.  Also a novel where it isn't enough to just \\"seem the movie\\"	2004-05-15

They're states of equilibrium that get pushed beyond a tipping point into a new, and very different equilibrium.  Interesting in changing the status quo?  This book will give you ideas.<br />Gladwell does an excellent job of synthesis, taking seemingly diffferent phenomenon, and capturing a theory that unifies them.  The end of the analysis is a toolset for the reader to analyze situations on their own.  <br />If have a dilemna that we need to think systemically about, we can divide our targets into Connectors (those people who make it a point to connect to large groups), Mavens (information banks) and Salesmen (idea spreaders).  The book cites examples of each, such as a Connector whose personal connections made his famous ride so successful.<br />Indeed the impact of the book is seen in it's own proliferation.  I received it from a friend, and recommended it to another, and here I am posting about it to Amazon.  The ideas stick!<br />My one complaint on the book is that despite the hype, the material isn't original.  The issue isn't plagirism, it is just that much of the material has been hyped before.  Followers of chaos theory or complexity know that a small change can have a big impact.  Many of the studies cited here have appeared elsewhere, such as Caldini's \\"Influence.\\"  Despite that, if you've read the material before, it's a good reminder, and if you haven't, welcome to the new material.  :-)	2004-05-15

Initially the book delivered on the promise.  It educated me about the falacy of many facts presented as local history, and explained the context in which they were done.  That theory alone made the book a worth purchase.<br />Unfortunately, things slowed as the book hit the Southern States.  Virtually every article turned into slaveholder bashing and an assault on the Daughters of the Confederacy.  While this was all historically accurate, and warranted, the obsession of the South's sins really pushed the book to the limits of readability.  After 5 or 6 examples, I know that history was re-written to glorify the Confederates.  I don't need twenty.  <br />In the end, I just couldn't finish it.  The topics were interesting, but the lessons became repetive and ran out of gas about 80 pages from the end.  I come away conflicted, as the approach of questioning history really is valuable.  Perhaps if the book was titled, &quot;Lies about Reconstruction&quot; it would have prepared me for the long slow slog.	2004-05-11

Gordon Liddy seems to generate a lot of different views.  Liberals hate him, though Al Franken is a good friend of his.  Conservatives respect him, though he doesn't seem to be able to stomach Bill O'reilly.  Timothy Leary - well, they considered each other respected adversaries.  Mr. Liddy's autobiography will provide keen insights into the man, the story and the legend.<br />This is more than just a viewpoint on Watergate.  In fact, if that's what you're after, you'll probably be disappointed.  The book covers his upbringing, his early military career, his arrest of Timothy Leary, his personal development of willpower, and his initial forays into the political arena.<br />Who cares?  Well, one of the questions of Watergate is &quot;Why?&quot; and this helps quite a bit.  As someone who was very young at the time, I do not have a great deal of recall of the situation.  Mr. Liddy does a good job explaining his views of society at the time - that America was at war from within, and he was duty bound to do everything in his power to re-elect and then protect the President.<br />You know the outcome of the Watergate breakins, but the story still draws you in.  You know bad things will happen, but you want to see how the G-man comes through it.  His stay in prison is common knowledge, but how did survive and even thrive in there?<br />I suspect this autobiography will amplify your feelings of the man.  Those that hate him may find him a monster.  Those who like him will deepen their respect.  I came in to the book on the fence, and find myself admiring a man whom I still am working to comprehend.  To use one of his favorite words, you'll find this a very potent book.  Even if you don't like him.	2004-05-11

He has his own nuances, such as a need to overpack.  How does that fit into the life of the troubador?  It doesn't, and that peek behind the illusion makes this journey a personal one.<br />The one downside is that if you're not a Parrothead, the book is probably not for you.  If you are a Parrothead, get out the blender, set the chair just right on the deck, and enjoy the book on a lazy sunny afternoon.	2004-05-11

In a sense, we all become rats, with one as king.  Much of the book studies the manipulations between folks vying for power.  There are the Americans trying to enforce prison standards.  There are people living off of rank to hold a grasp of dignity.  And then there is the King of the title, who finds a way to transcend above the problems, living off the black market and a network of informants.<br />We are introduced to the character that most closely resembles Clavell in this novel too.  Though he reappears in Noble House, we first catch the author as the King's sidekick, a downed soldier who has to struggle with where his loyalties are.  <br />I can not recommend the series enough.  Whether you go through it chronologically as written, or in the order of time periods written about, you'll find this a deep addition to the series.	2004-04-21

It's a world of the occult, imps around every corner, and religeon as a part of daily life.<br />Reading his stories is like getting grandfather's tales about the old country.  A little bit spooky, a little bit comforting, and quite a bit nostalgic.<br />Although Jews will probably understand more of the historical references, the stories are well written enough for a broad audience.  Perhaps this reader's only regret is not being able to read them in their original Yiddish.  The translations are done by an all star cast including Saul Bellow, but perhaps nothing beats the original.	2004-04-19

The story starts with the two Steves making and selling boxes to confuse the phone system into granting free calls.  It chronicals the development of Apple computer from the first Apple through the Lisa, endless varities of Macintosh and today's iPod.  Throughout the story, the massive ups and collosal failures of this American instution are laid bare.<br />The layout is interesting as well.  As characters are introduced, the reader frequently wonders &quot;What happened to them?&quot;  More often than not, the question is answered in a sidebar.  This showed that Apple wasn't just a great product developer, but also a great developer of silicon valley talent.<br />The book details the extremes of the players personalities:<BR>- How Jobs agreet to split the proceeds of an Atari deal with Woz, only to keep 90% of the income himself.<BR>- How Woz forced the company to go public early by sharing his stock with too many employees.<BR>- How Gasse talked folks out of liscencing the technology until it was too late.<BR>- How several successive CEOs tried in vain to save the company.<br />The book also details some lesser known stories from Apple's storied past:<BR>- How the 1984 commercial almost never made it.<BR>- How the company decided to abandon Copland.  (&amp; Why!)<BR>- How the company got sued by Carl Sagan, and how they dug their ditch a little deeper.<br />There's a lot of &quot;Hows&quot; here, which really shows how deep the author gets into the company's history and soul.  You come away with not just a knowledge of the people, but their personalities and why exactly things turned out the way they did.<br />This book is excellent reading for anyone interested in the world of technology, and an absolute must for fans of Apple.	2004-04-19

Along the way, he tells the tales of several stars who fell from grace.  We meet Jack Grubman, the ultimate telecom insider later associated with singing the praises of a telecom industry in freefall.  Frank Quattrone appears in the role of the corrupter, turning unsuspecting analysts like Mary Meeker into salesmen for investment bankers instead of researchers for customers.  Henry Blodget plays the ultimate kool-aid drinking tech believer.<br />Only those involve know if these charicatures are true, but they certainly make for an interesting read.  (If they're not true, perhaps they should be!)<br />Kessler also presents a good overview of what went wrong in the industry.  Margins on sales and trading activities diminished, so research needed to be funded on the back of banking deals.  Add to that an environment of loose money, spurred by some very succesful tech IPOs.  Over time, and industry appears of people whose livelihood depends on making money off the \\"popping\\" of hot IPOs as they flourish.  Letting \\"Friends of Frank (Quattrone)\\" in on the gold rush is part of the deal.  The scam is perpetuated by an artificially imposed holding period.<br />If there's one weak spot in the book, it's an oversimplification of a solution to a problem which the author admits is hard.  Would fixing the holding period problem (& allowing new companies to float more stock) really help autocorrect the prices quicker?  Or would it encourage \\"Get rich quick\\" schemes?  The lack of transparency in the process is hard to solve.  Maybe the best advice is for the novice investor to beware.<br />This complaint notwithstanding, the book is an outstanding read.  In addition tochuckling and enjoying the fun, you'll come away with a better understanding of what happened in the bubble, and how people slowly get corrupted.	2004-01-29

In a sense, he was Harry's Norton.  In this book, he tells the shadow's story, including the ups and down.<br />On the humorous side, Steve discusses Harry's struggle to remember names, and how he tormented Arnie (the producer) with his requests.  <br />Steve also paints the image of Harry the promoter, explaining how in his way, Harry promoted the character that Steve was to play on the air.  Stone also admits that he owes his job in many ways to Harry.  That they stayed together for 15 years is a tribute to a partnership that in many ways seemed like a marriage.<br />Some of the things you may not know...  With only a very rare exception, he didn't drink on TV, but kept the Bud glass a plug for his sponsors.  That he always paid when we went out, even though he'd plug his favorite watering holes. <br />Steve also covers the dark side of Harry - how he handled grudges.  How he'd insist on being the prima donna.  Their petty fights, and how they'd get over them.  His ostracism and eventual reconciliation with his family.<br />In the end, you're left with both a fitting and realistic picture of the icon.	2004-01-22

As customers of talent, they bring a unique viewpoint to career management.  The treatment is more rigorous than one would expect from what could be a touchy feely book.<br />I read the book while contemplating what experiences are good for my career.  It gives some key insights on careers, such as successful people don't push their way to success, they are carried by those around them.  This highlights the need to help others succeed instead of keeping a self centered view of success.<br />While interesting, the reader is left without a lot of lasting depth.  I finished the book about 2 months ago, but struggled to come up with key points from memory.  If it were more impactful, perhaps I would have remembered them.	2004-01-13

The Zachman framework presented a great way to think about the relationships between systems, data, processes and business.  Later on, as a project manager, it provided a more useful tool for understanding the importance of architecture in developing systems.  In addition, it applies to architects and senior IT managers who want to make the most of their investment.<br />The writing displays the academic rigor of the author's background, as well as the applicability that comes from his wealth of experience.  Perhaps this blend is best typified in the only application I've seen of reapplying (rewriting?) Deming's 14 points of management for an application in IT.<br />Perhaps what separates this book from most is how well it's held up over time.  At 10 years old, it hasn't aged.  If anything, in today's age of complexity, the relevance of a coherent understanding of architecture is more important than ever.  This book will help you understand it.	2004-01-13

It continues the story of Twoflower and Rincewind as they bungle their way through saving the universe, or at least Discworld, from a collision with a great red star.  New characters are introduced, such as Cohen the Barbarian, an 80something hero currently suffering from chronic back pains.  Like a great series, it closes some doors in the ongoing saga, while showing others to be explored.    The book reads quickly, though perhaps you wonder if the characters would catch on as soon as the reader.  More of Discworld is explained too, which is interesting for readers.  (Though a disappointment for those left from the cliffhanger of \\"The Color of Magic\\"    My main knock is that the level of satire does not go much above escapism.  Or if it did, it was lost on this reader.  Ultimately the book provided some mild thought, and an escape, but not much more.  But perhaps I shouldn't have asked for that either.  Bottom line is if you enjoyed his other novels, you will probably enjoy this one too.  But not his best...	2004-01-03

I use \\"Lou's own words\\" with intent here, as there was no ghost writer or co-author.  The story of the revival of an American icon is written from the viewpoint of the man picked to do it himself.<br />The book is organized into 4 sections:  Getting Hold, Strategy, Culture, Lessons Learned and Observations.  (ok, so that's 5 sections)<br />Getting Hold covers Gerstner's initial immersion into the new environment, and his analysis of the problems.  He also covers his famous comment that \\"the last thing IBM needs is vision\\" and explains his view in the need for tactics and execution.  This flies in the face of what one might expect from a former consultant, and is consistent with other recent books such as \\"Execution\\" by Charan and Bossidy.<br />Strategy covers how Gerstner came to the belief that IBM should not be broken up.  This was in contrast to the spinoff frenzy of the times, and came from his view as a former customer that the market needed someone to pull all the technology pieces together, and that was IBM's only competitive advantage.  The strategy is covered in business terms accessible to people outside the industry.<br />Perhaps the biggest \\"Aha\\" in the book is the story of Gerstner battling the legendary IBM culture.  This is covered in the Culture section, along with his stories of how he tried to insure that his changes are permanent.  The importance of this culture change is highlighted in Gerstner's pride that his successor is a blue bleeding IBM life.  (Ultimately Lou admits that even after 10 years he was still an outsider)<br />The lessons learned and observations sections are less a narrative of the IBM turnaround, and more lessons on turnarounds in general, and the computing industry.  For students of management, this will hold the most value.<br />There were two downsides of the book.  First is coming to grips with some of the inconsistencies in the methods used to turn around IBM.  For a while, Gerstner rails against processes, instead challenging people to focus on customer needs.  While reading it, one wonders how a complex organization can integrated many businesses without good processes.  Later on Gerstner extols the virtues of his re-engineering project, especially along several key processes vital for turning around IBM.  Makes sense, but contradicts his earlier writing.<br />The other downside is answering why IBM needed an outsider to change it.  Gerstner points out several times that IBM was a great company that just appeared stuck in some bad behaviors.  Current management wisdom holds that insiders are better turnaround artists than outsiders.  Why is this the exception that proves the rule?  Is modesty the answer?  (It is generally left to the reader to assume that a customer's viewpoint was needed)<br />I would not let these detract from what was otherwise an interesting (and overdue) story of one of today's great turnarounds.  The material comes straight from the source (as compared to the story of Ghosn's turnaround of Nissan) and from an individual of much higher personal integrity than Sunbeam's Al Dunlap.	2004-01-03

Perhaps that is why this book disappoints me so much.  The text is hard to read - much more appropriate for an academic journal than a general text.  (There are 40+ footnotes in each chapter, making it seem like a list of quotations rather than anything real)  This would be forgivable if the conclusions were either clear or accurate.  (Example:  The comment that Japan is on the verge of inflation.  I'm sure most policy makers in Japan wishes this were true, but it's been stuck in a quagmire of deflation for quite some time)  Lastly, the book just is not timely.  For a work with 1st and 2nd editions in 2000 and 2003, most of the references are from the 1970s and mid 1980s.  There has been a lot of post-bubble scholarship that is missed.  <br />I am wholly dissatisfied with this book.	2004-01-03

On the surface, the novel covers the story of Pi (ironic choice to name a devoutly religious character after a mathematical number once considered heretical), a boy whose belief in multiple religions causes consternation to both religious leaders and his family.<br />During the family's move to North America, Pi's ocean liner sinks, and he is forced onto the lifeboat with a tiger, a jackal and a zebra.  The book is the story of his survival, and eventual landing in America.<br />The book manages several dichotomies.  It is religeous, but agnostic.  It balances humor with sadness, a believability with fancy, and ultimately fact and allegory.<br />The story forces some thoughts about the meaning of religion, and importance and allegory.  (I hate coming back to that word, but it's the only one that will do)  At times I felt as a reader that I was being spoon fed pop-psychology about spirituality being good, and organized religeon being hard-headed.  At other times, I struggled with the deeper meaning in the book.  In the end, I'm not sure I \\"got it all\\" but I got enough to consider the read well worth the time.  Even with it's imperfections, it's a book that can change the reader.	2004-01-03

As the book meanders on, the reader painfully starts rooting for the despicable protagonists.  Is it because of identification?  Or maybe the recollection that the people they are using are actually using them in return?  Or maybe it just is not so black and white.<br />The book has been hailed as a modern classic.  I'm not sure it did that much for me.  There are lessons in responsibility, changing times and personal weakness that are enduring.  Perhaps it is the style of the book, written in a Kerouac style - an Irish \\"On the Road\\".  It's a worthy read, in an interesting (even delightful) style, but I struggle to find the greatness to which it's been ascribed.  Maybe when I understand the greatness of Sir Vidia, I'll understand this as well.	2004-01-03

Similar to \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\", this book is more about the experiences of an outsider fitting in to Japan than the occupational hazards of teaching English.  To use his own words, Fielder really does cut into the heart of Japan.  Interspersed between stories of the challenges of the educational system are many deeper lessons.  Included are an explanation of the importance of group harmony and identity, how co-workers balance formal working relationships with personal bonds, and how personal development differs between Japan and the West.<br />Perhaps my only struggle was hearing how hard it was for the author to find a date in Japan.  Japan is legendary for English teachers \\"punching above their weight\\" and finding girlfriend's well out of their league in the US.  But perhaps the book would have lost it's tone and cultural insights if it degenerated into a story of how many girls the author picked up.<br />The book has held up remarkably over the past 10 years.  Despite the bursting of the Japanese bubble, the cultural lessons ring true today.  I recommend the book to anyone interested in Japan, independent of occupation.	2004-01-03

It has defined the agenda for the software engineering field, as well as guide the organizational design for many software and IT organizations.<br />Some key concepts from the book...<BR>- It is not good project management to divide effort by time to come up with staffing.  Adding people adds commuications complexity, so double staff size quadruples the amount of communications links.<BR>- To insure conceptual integrity, the software project needs the design to be handled by a very small group of people.<BR>- The optimal model for a software development team is a hospital surgical unit.<BR>- There is no silver bullet for improved quality, just a lot of best practices.<br />Mr. Brooks brings a wealth of experience to bear on this.  As the head of some of IBM's largest operating system development projects, he's been in the guts of some of the hardest challenges the industry has to offer.  He writes in a non-technical style that cuts to the heart of these difficult topics.<br />In the latest edition, Mr. Brooks takes a hard look at what he got right and wrong over the years.

The &quot;Vanities&quot; that are being blown up are all the pretensions that people put around themselves.  Sherman McCoy is a man who would've exuded strength and power in a prior age.  But is he a &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; bond trader (a term coined by Tom Wolfe, later to make it into the popular lexicon) or just another fluffed up product of society?  Indeed, the book explores this question.  You'll be surprised by the answer!<br />Is it just a novel of the 80s?  I disagree, for several reasons...<BR>- The greed of the 80s reappeared in the past 5 years.<BR>- If you look hard enough, one of the characters in the book is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.<BR>- The deep characters Wolfe creates ring true today.<BR>- New York again sees itself in a time of great change.  Maybe there are lessons in this literature?<br />Is it the Great American Novel?  Who knows...

If you're reading this review, you've probably read dozens of witicisms from Richard Feynman, one of science's most colorful characters.  Though the name suggests otherwise, this is really about a Feynman inspired journey.  <br />Ralph Leighton and Richard Feynman spot a stamp from Tuva, which inspires Leighton's journey around the world.  What makes the book an interesting read is that you can easily follow Feyman's curious energy in the actions and writing of the author.  This really brings the heart of the book's value - this type of intellectual curiosity is not just the property of Richard Feynman.  Anyone can chase a journey because it's fun or because it's there.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and hope that you do too.	2003-11-30

The book is still in print in Japan, though it's relevance to today is diminishing.  <br />On the very surface it is a sympathetic appeal to what the salaryman has to put up with.

Sold the companies for huge profit to himself and the shareholders.<BR>- Much of his success came from the ideas of external consultants.<BR>- He destroyed Sunbeam in a massive explosion of layoffs, fraud and corporate mismanagement.<br />So should one listen to his advice?  If you're willing to separate the message from the author, there is quite a bit of good advice to be had:<BR>1 - If a business is dying, you have to put the needs of the shareholders first.  If there's no company, there are no jobs either.<BR>2 - Cutting costs is a hard business.  Unless you cut enough fat with confidence the first time around, you'll spend forever in a downward cycle of repeat layoffs and dwindling morale.<BR>3 - Product complexity equals cost, and if you want to simplify your marketing and manufacturing, reduce the variations in your products.<BR>4 - More factories mean more costs.  Aggresive consolidation of manufacturing is required in a shrinking business.<br />Hard to argue with these, and they are indeed worth knowing.<br />Is the book worth reading?  Yes, but....

This book it Tom Peters at his loudest, Tom Peters at his most outlandish, and perhaps Tom Peters at his most insightful.  Rather than traditional black and white text, the layout reads like a website, with color, graphics and quasi-hyperlinks to sidebars on every page.  <br />Some of the topics that he tackles head on:<BR>1 - The gross neglect of women in the marketplace.  (Why don't we market better to the people controlling the $$$?)<BR>2 - The gross neglect of the emerging active elederly in the marketplace.  (Similar comments)<BR>3 - The continuing need to fight a war for talent.<BR>4 - The growing importance of design.<BR>5 - The movement to automate and outsource all routine work.<BR>6 - Given the above, the need to rewire and rethink the enterprise.<br />The overall premise is that these aren't times of incremental change, these are times for drastic change.  While much of corporate America is hunkering down, this book shouts that we need to be looking broadly.  What can we do that is unique that can't be replaced by a $50 microprocesser?  And of what's left, what can be uniquely be done in the US versus India?  With this knowledge, how do we manage our careers and organizations?  It certainly forces a hard look at our current reality.<br />There are a lot of negatives that can be heaped on this book:<BR>1 - He's too over the top.<BR>2 - He just doesn't get the realities of the workplace.<BR>3 - It's not internally consistent.<BR>4 - The layout is just too &quot;in your face&quot;.<br />Net - If you're looking for a calm book that will help you do your current job better, this isn't it.  (Think &quot;the Effective Executive&quot; by Drucker for a great work on that line.)  If you're looking to get some &quot;Ahas&quot; about how to rethink about the world, this is it.  Nobody will agree with everything, but everyone will come away thinking about something.<br />When I first read this book, I thought, &quot;He's off his rocker.  Again!&quot;  Then I looked back to the last time I thought that - when he wrote &quot;Liberation Management&quot;  It turned into one of the most influential books of my career.  Based on that gut feel, I believe that this book trumps much of what Tom has written in the past several years (in fact, it includes much of what was written in his last 3 mini-books) and ranks with &quot;Liberation Management&quot; and &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; as his masterpieces.<br />More than anything else, the book made me think.  I hope it does the same for you.	2003-11-29

Brought to life by Hemingway, the book is a compact masterpiece, bringing you into the boat and struggle with the Old Man himself.<br />It is tough to judge what makes a book Nobelworthy.  I certainly find most in that genre unapproachable.  This book did speak to me, and I encourage you to let it speak to you.  In terms of impact, it stylistically encouraged those books beyond it to be tighter in style and impact.  The allegorical style was most recently copied in the Life of Pi.	2003-10-21

Follow Connor Burke, a long time student of the martial arts, as he works to uncover the mystery and determine how his sensei fits into the picture.<br />John Donahue brings a wealth of understanding of both Japanese culture and the martial arts community to the novel.  Unlike many martial arts books (and most martial arts movies) the book captures much of the spirit, discipline and realism of martial arts training.  The book also captures the enigmatic sensei/student relationship inherent in martial arts graining.<br />The book weakens when some of the major players act off-character to advance the plot.  The story is intricate and gripping, but it's a shame that some of the character realism had to be sacrificed.  Many times you're left wondering, &quot;Why doesn't anyone see what's really happening?&quot; or &quot;Why doesn't he just make a call on his cellphone?&quot;<br />Despite the shortcomings, I'm looking forward to reading the upcoming sequel.	2003-10-06

Getting results.<br />Drucker spells this out in clear language, and basis his advice for executives on getting results.  In a world where people mistake passion, energy, enthusiasm or relationship building for results, this is vital.  There are many tools an executive can use to achieve results, but in the end, the results are what he (or she) is judged by.<br />The book works through tactical advice on how to increase ones ability to make results.  This includes advice on meeting management (&quot;one can work or meet, but not both&quot;), time management (focusing on the important tasks over crisis) and innovating by staying close to one's customers.<br />Get this book to help you separate fad from fantasy from fact.  It will improve your management and leadership effectiveness.	2003-10-06

Stephen takes us through his childhood, discussing key events in his development as a person and a writer.  This sets the context for the experiences he later writes about.<br />The second half is the &quot;On Writing&quot; part, where he gives advice to aspiring fiction writers.  He covers technical aspects (be concise) as well as tips on the creative process (don't sweat the plot, create situations and be true to what the characters would do in them).  He describes the process of writing as &quot;finding a fossil&quot; - the fossil of the story is out there, use the most subtle tools out there to share the fossil.<br />At the end, Steve covers his current status and recovery from a near death experience at the hands of an errant van driver.  Perhaps this is the most touching part of the story.<br />This book does capture some very useful nuggets of information, and will be especially useful to avid king readers.  In that sense, it isn't just a trade book for writers.  Enjoy!	2003-09-28
US	40882846	R7TIHHI61955Z	0875847161	571072005	Competing for the Future	Books	5	14	14	N	N	1990s thought leadership	Hamel and Prahalad brought two ideas to the forefront of management in the 1990s:  Creating a strategic intent that dominates corporate thinking, and then understanding the core competencies that the organization requires to get there.  Rather than create numerous 5 year plans, communicate the direction and insure you have the skills to get there.<br />The impact of this was felt across corporate Americas.  As companies struggled in reacting to changing times, they would talk more of core competencies instead of certainy of the future.  Well run companies could also articulate their vision and what they're good at.  (Example GE:  &quot;We are #1 or #2 in every business we run.  We get there by rigorous management and continuous improvement.&quot;)  These ideas are here to stay.  <br />Is it all so simple?  In Consulting Demons, Lewis Pinault takes issue with Prahalad and his consulting practice at Gemini.  He asserts that the ideas can be misapplied to fuel a consulting boom, and that Prahalad's missionary zeal was better for generating consulting fees than for corporate bottom lines.<br />Bottom line - the book is a good introduction to some important strategic concepts.  Although it is no longer required reading at top consulting firms, it is still relevant and important.  Just take the ideas (like all pop management ideas) with a grain of salt.	2003-09-24

What would happen to Midori?  Wasn't Harry traceable?<br />The book opens up more of John Rain's character, showing both his strenghts and some more obvious weaknesses.  (Why can't spies like him not shag every girl they meet?)  It also closes several loose ends hanging over from previous books.

If there's one downside of the book, perhaps a few of the supporting charachters (particularly in the CIA) were not as believable as I'd expect.<br />The equisite writing of Tokyo life continues to capture the reader.

This question is at the heart of Re-engineering the Corporation, a book that started a wave of corporate restructuring.  At it's best, the book offers the reader tools for staggering leaps of improvement (Cut cycle time from a week to 2 hours) by focusing on processes instead of internal organizations.  Instead of asking, \\"How do we improve what we do?\\" the reader is challenged to ask, \\"What is absolutely required to serve the customer?\\"    The book is broken up in sections of theory followed by case studies where re-engineering did meet the lofty goals.  As would be expected from a Manifesto, there is an evangelical zeal with the book.  The authors aim inspire in addition to educate.  It isn't enough that you understand reengineering, you must go out and do it.    The main criticism of the book comes from the authors own admission that two thirds of all reengineering projects fail.  If that's the case, does it pay out to begin a project like this?  Or are more modest goals really appropriate?  How does one avoid a major failure?  The length of the book (in the spirit of the content, the book is very concise!) doesn't permit the authors to answer these questions.  It's up to the individual manager to best decide how to apply the lessons in the real world.	2003-09-24

It's a spy thriller set in Modern Tokyo, capturing the ambiance of the neo-future Metropolis sprouting above and ancient culture.<br />There are three main selling points for the book.  First is the main character.  John Rain is part James Bond, part Trevanian's Nicolai Hel, and part Blade Runner.   He's both complex and interesting.  His &quot;voice&quot; comes off as an old friend with a shady path.<br />The second stellar point is the ability of Eisler to capture Tokyo.  It's a Tokyo that many expats will recongize.  The places, style and feel of the city are brought to life with excellent prose.  I truly felt like I was back in Roppongi and Shinjuku.  The flashbacks really brought me back to a great place.<br />Lastly, the book has a gripping &quot;can't put it down&quot; quality.  Expect to read the book in one sitting.  Don't start it unless you have time to finish it.  You'll find yourself looking at the clock at 3am thinking, &quot;Where did the time go?&quot;<br />Well done on an outstanding novel!	2003-09-24

The protagonist returns to Thailand after a long exit, expecting life to be similar to what he walked away from.  Instead, he learns that you can never go home again, even in Asia.  By the end, Brian Mason also realizes that the Thailand and people he remembered perhaps wasn't even as it really appeared the first time around.<br />Barrett really captured the essence of Thailand, and the extoic and hypnotic effects it can have.  His writing draws you in to the story, and you become compelled to finish it in just a few sittings.<br />The only knock is characters that seem just a quarter shade from believable.  A couple times I thought to myself, &quot;They really wouldn't do that...&quot; but perhaps that's because the characters were based on real people who don't act as we expect.	2003-09-16

How can you learn statistics when the examples are wrong?  You spend hours pondering the equations, only to realize they are errors from the author.<br />The author should either stick to topics they know, or stop churning these books out so fast that the quality resembles rotten eggs.<br />This was a rare book that inspired enough anger to write such a disparaging review.	2003-09-16

Jim Rogers, gazillionaire of Quantum Fund fame, takes you on a riding and investing adventure around the world.  During his travels you'll learn a little about local culture, a little about Jim's investment philosophy (go to where they allow open flows of money - just get there before everyone else) and a little about investment tips.  Much of this would be great to have learned 7 or 8 years ago.  Indeed, the book sparked my interest in working abroad.<br />If you enjoyed his later work, Adventure Capitalist, you're sure to like this too.  The only knock is that many of his observations are now dated, as his pessimism has grown over time.  (Examnple:  He's not so bullish on Turkey and parts of Latin America.)	2003-08-06

The book follows Jim's 3 year millenium tour around the world in 1999-2001.  As Jim and his fiance/wife travel the world, they share lessons in history, culture and global economics.  <br />The book contains both specific details on countries (Japan is at or near a bottom, where everyone's given up, and may be due a rebound.  There's a bubble forming in US housing) as well as general views supporting free market economics.  It also manages to be both profound and captivating.  There are lessons worth pondering, but the story keeps grabbing you back.  In the end, you'll be surprised at how much you learned.<br />The book also has a more mature tone than &quot;Investment Biker&quot;.  You can see some of the youthful enthusiasm at a world losing it's boundries replaced with concern over the troubles in today's world.  Jim's prior viewpoint of a single man is replaced with coping with his father's mortality and the responsibility of a new family.  It's as if the initial book was written by your older brother, while this was written by your dad.<br />I had a bias going in - &quot;Investment Biker&quot; was an eye opening book early in my career.  This book still managed to exceed my expectations.  It ranks with Friedman's &quot;The Lexus and the Olive Tree&quot; in explaining what's going on in the world, while maintaining a Paul Theroux view of the world from the low road.  (Learning more from border crossings than from airports and red carpets)  It's also been my top read of the year to date.<br />Pick it up!  It's well worth it!	2003-07-29

Seems far fetched, but somehow it works.  Very well, at that.<br />Spiegelman weaves three stories between two books.  First and foremost is the story of his father Vladek's survival of the Holocost.  Second is Art and Vladek coming to grips with each other, a relationship that is strained at best.  Lastly is the story of Vladek's love for his wife Anja, and how Art and Vladek come to grips with her death.<br />This is no Hollywood story.  The humor is dark, at best.  No punches are pulled with the Holocost.  There is no great happy ending.  The book covers how people cope with the terrible.  It does so in a very real and true manner.  Truly gripping.<br />The author is to be commended to be opening up his life, as well as the lives of his family.  The honesty makes for gripping and disturbing coverage of a most important topic.	2003-07-23

The intended target audience is hedge fund investors, which is reinforced by the author's credentials as an executive in a &quot;Fund of Funds&quot;.  In addition, the book would be very useful as an interview to financial markets, useful for business students interested in careers in trading or hedge funds.<br />The book starts with a broad overview of market theory, covering efficient markets, diversification theory and strengths and weaknesses of the &quot;Random Walk&quot; theory.  The book then moves to an overview of the various investment tools available to hedge funds, such as going long and short on stock prices and volatility.  (If you'd like to know in plain english what being &quot;long volatility&quot; means, this is a good book for you!)  The book then covers legal, financial and operational details of running a fund.  Lastly, it covers the various types of funds, such as equity funds and event driven funds.  The scope of the material covers financial institutions such as investment banks and brokers that support hedge funds.<br />In summary, this was a very informative introductory text on both hedge funds and markets.  It will be very useful to both new investors in hedge funds, as well as students of financial markets.

But this book is much much more...<br />The book starts with a history of ju jitsu.  It places Brazilian jiu jitsu in the context of Judo, Japanese JuJitsu and other martial arts.  It then covers the theory of jujitsu, including the various phases of fighting.  This background provides a great context or framework to understand techniques.  (This is analogous to the economic framework behind financial technqiues)<br />After providing the broad context, the book delves into deeper theory on each general position, along with a few specific techniques.  Again, the focus is on frameworks and how to think about positions more than a listing of techniques.  <br />The book also contains case studies on various fighters who have learned certain aspects of fighting.  Although the book has a jujitsu focus, fighters from other arts such as Mark Coleman and Vanderlei Silva are highlighted.  This demonstrates the broad landscape of ideas covered.<br />In summary, this has proven to be a uniquely informative book.  The authors use the medium (book versus the common tape format) to convey history and theory that is more difficult to convey in class or on a tape.  It's about time that someone wrote it!	2003-07-22

There is no &quot;Salvation is in religeon&quot; or &quot;Follow my framework&quot; or &quot;Just listen to yourself&quot; easy answer here.  Instead, the book follows some loose themes of people struggling with this question.  Perhaps this lack of a concrete answer (and there really is none!) is why there is so much passion both praising and attacking this work.<br />As someone going through some of these questions myself, I came away with some definite takeaways:<BR>1 - Figuring out what to do is not an easy task.<BR>2 - It's rarely a quick process.<BR>3 - Others are going through it to, and it's not a fruitless pursuit.<br />Although I did not come out of reading the book with a grand Buddhist enlightenment, I did come away with a better understanding of the murky question suggested by the title.	2003-06-24

The need for this is obvious - even the best writers fall prey to redundant or misused words.<br />The organization of the book doesn't support such a grand ambition, though.  A dictionary format would seem to be a good way to remedy the problem, but the author slips between types of mistakes and specific words.  In doing this, the book becomes hard to follow, and lacks a core theory or concept to follow.

A theory tying them together would be helpful for putting it into practice.  The average manager is hard pressed to use such a thick catalogue.<BR>3 - Fixating on 5 strengths seems a bit restrictive.  Maybe some people have 3 or 4 or 6?  It would be useful if the tool could give relative weights or scores on them as well.<br />In summary, the book is best used as a survey for folks interested in a self assessment.  More depth (a follow-up book?) is needed to put the ideas into general practice.	2003-06-12

It develops the concepts from the ground up, using intuition without requiring the mathematics or jargon of other economics texts.<br />I give the book 5 stars because it was exactly what I needed - a refresher on the subject that answered several intuitive questions I had on how money supply interacts with inflation and economic growth.  Despite this rating, the book had several shortcomings:<BR>1 - Several key terms could have been defined better.<BR>2 - The authors have a left leaning agenda.  They acknowlege this, and do their best to separate controversial points from universally agreed points, but I think their &quot;general concensus&quot; was still left of where many academics land.<BR>3 - The material is aging, and the book could use an update explaining the internet downturn and the after-effects of the Asian financial crisis.  An explanation of the near-meltdowns of Russia and Latin America would be interesting, as the authors had previously highlights the Confederate States of America and Czarist Russia as the only countries to ever previously default on their money.<br />Despite these drawbacks, this is an excellent tome on the subject for critical thinkers willing to keep an open mind.	2003-06-11

Agree or not, this is the seminal book on the subject.  It's core to the curriculum of the University of Chicago's finance program - and that is quite a reference.

The book is organized around chapters from the founders of Gracie Jiu Jitsu (Carlos and Helio) through the family champions (Carlson, Rolls and Rickson), famous instructors (Rorion and Carlos Jr.) and modern champions (Royler, Renzo &amp; Royce).<br />Behind the backdrop of personal biographies is a history of the art.  Brazilian jiu jitsu started with Count Koma, who taught it to Carlos, who in turn taught it to Helio.  Helio, Carlson and Rolls all put their own personal imprints on the art while in Brazil.  Rorion brought the art to the US, introducing it to the masses through the Ultimate Fighting Championship.<br />Although the book paints a very positive picture of the family, it does cover some of the troubles the family has seen.  Royler, Renzo and Royce's defeats at the hands of Sakuraba are covered, as well as the breakup of Carlos's team of champions.<br />The photographs alone make the book a treasure.  Kid Peligro has unequaled family archives, which provides stories not heard elsewhere.  In addition, he was able to interview many friends of the family such as Romero &quot;Jacare&quot; Cavalcanti and Carlao Valente.<br />A very interesting book to anyone interested in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and the history.

This is the true value of the book.<br />This book is about individual performance, though and not strategy.  As such, the lessons are more along the lines of &quot;The Book of 5 rings&quot; than &quot;The Art of War&quot;.  I found the overall lessons less profound than those classics, but that is not the responsibility of the translator. <br />Cleary is an expert at translating Eastern thoughts for Western readers.  My one complaint on the translation is the use of metaphors such as, &quot;at the end of one's rope&quot;.  It leaves the reader questioning the translation - was he trying to tranlate another metaphor, or is he turning a concrete concept into a cliche?	2003-05-13

Phyllis Birnbaum researches the women with a professional biographers precision, with warts and all.  She analyzes their progressive ideas in the context of the times they stepped away from conformity.  In this sense, the biographies are very much stories of the times, and the reader is treated to a history lesson as well.  Definitely a good read for any Japanophile.    The struggle against society and conformity also transcends Japan, making this work interesting reading above and beyond the Japanese context.	2003-05-13

Readers in search of the typical bravado, bullfights and war scenes will be in for a shock.  The dialogue between the main characters is really what drives this.<br />The novel is about the story of an army colonel finding the love of his life too late to enjoy her.  It contains the bittersweet pain of a premature ending that all will know comes too soon.  Both the colonel and his young countess realize they are on borrowed time, and Hemingway shares the pain with his readers.  The foreshadowing is reminiscent of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; although it is not an action oriented novel per say.<br />Also touching is the undertone of a loving friendship built between the colonel and the staff at his favorite hotel.  There too, the dialogue is at it's finest.  You can read the care between old comrades, and feel the spirit of their kinship.<br />Read it expecting romantic dialogue intertwined with the pains of love, and you will enjoy it.  Read it looking for the big game hunting or submarine search and you'll be disappointed.	2003-05-12

It is fair to call Deming the father, godfather, grandfather and preacher of the quality movement.  This book, written in 1986 after he achieved international fame for helping improve quality in Japan, captures the spirit and ideas that spawned a revolution.<br />The book captures many of the key points in Deming's philosophy:<BR>1)  Creating metrics based approaches to management, without falling into a quota system.<BR>2)  Differentiating between problems caused by the system and problems outside of the system.<BR>3)  Focusing on both doing things correctly, and identifying the right tasks to approach.<BR>4)  Introducing a Plan, Do, Check, Act cycle of continuous improvement.<br />If you look at this list, the book presents a blueprint for many of the so called management revolutions of the subsequent 15 years:  Excellence, Re-engineering, Process Management, Systems Thinking.  This book really is both a trend setter as well as highly important body of theory.  The theory is relevant today, as many management problems today can be addressed by his 14 points of management.  (Example:  A reliance on inspection is bad - build quality into the process.  This is highly relevant to software construction today.)<br />So are there any knocks?<BR>1)  You're left with many imperatives, but sometimes without positive prescriptions.  For example: If you don't do annual performance reviews, what do you replace it with to determine who gets promoted?<BR>2)  The book can be dry and hard to follow.  Sometimes it is written as notes pieced together.<BR>3)  Many of the companies that Deming held up as models have fallen on tougher times.  It seems that today Quality alone is not enough.<br />Having said this, it should be required reading for any manager.  The theory is good, and the book should spark your thinking.	2003-05-12

Previous management authors such as Peter Drucker wrote academic oriented tomes for buisness executives.  Tom Peters wrote for the masses.<br />The book starts with an introduction explaining the problems in the economy (this was the early 80s, when fear of Japan Inc was rising) and why this abstract concept of &quot;Excellence&quot; was needed.  In many senses, the book's emphasis of &quot;What's Right in the US&quot; is really it's strongest selling point.  In the context of a world where America seemed to be losing it's way, the book provides a rallying cry for places that America is doing things right.<br />The book the passionately covers general management caveats, such as &quot;Stick to your knitting&quot; with examples of companies providing extensive focus on their core competencies.  It is important to note that Tom Peters does not claim to be a great management theorist here - his claim is to capture examples of companies who have figured out &quot;how to be excellent&quot;.  This is consistent with his academic training - an engineering background with a Phd in Organizational Behavior.  He's not developing new business models here, only capturing what others already know to be true.<br />So how does it hold up over time?<BR>Well, if you believe the naysayers, many of the supposedly excellent companies have gone belly up.  Peoples Express airline?  If you believe the Tom Peters website, his companies have still managed to beat the S&amp;P 500 over the past 20 years.<br />Bottom line - The book is still valid.  Closeness to customers is still as important as ever.  Companies are learning they do need to stick to their knitting.  This is a very entertaining and influential book.  It's worth reading for the insights, as well as the chance that your customer has read it too.  :-)	2003-05-12

Indeed, the book is much more than that.  It's a story of growing up in a crime ridden neighborhood.  It's about the confidence gained from martial arts.  It's about a boy coming of age.  And - also - it's about the underground hacker culture.<br />This really is an amazing work from such a young author, even with the help of a veteran contributor.  The insights are keen, and the ability to weave lessons from San Shou boxing through computer hacking through the revelations of the horror of 9/11 reveal an outstanding intellect and wisdom beyond the author's 20 years.  <br />The book is a quick read, and appropriate for a much broader audience than just folks interested in computers.  All the technical terms are clearly explained in the text and a glossary, and there is no assumption of advanced knowledge of computers.<br />Buy the book, read it, and enjoy it!	2003-03-24

As the pages turn, I get a perfect visual of Jim Cramer screaming and waving his arms as he exhorts his team to maximize the profits in their hedge fund.  It's a hedge fund as any viewer of Kudlow and Cramer would expect, with Cramer waving his arms, pulling at his tie, and screaming at the top of his lungs.  <br />It is easy to visualize the temper tantrums and computer terminals getting smashed.  The book also describes Maier's descent into the madness of a hyperactive &quot;blame the enemy&quot; day trader.  The personalities are clearly spelled out, and it's easy to understand the motivations of the key players.<br />The book is easily accessible to the layman.  The trading methodologies used are easily explained, as are the alleged improprieties commited by Jim Cramer.  The book reads quickly, and is easily digested over a 3 hour flight.<br />The one thing I struggle with is, &quot;Is it true?&quot;  In the end, none of the formal charges against Cramer stuck, and no hard evidence was produced.  To Maier's credit, he ends with a favorable review of Cramer's long term returns.	2003-03-24

Only slightly underneath, it's a fascinating work on the difference between Japanese and American culture.  The title word Wa comes from the Japanese word for team unity, as opposed to the American interest in individuality.<br />The book goes through both a history of baseball in Japan, as well as challenges American's deal with over there.  It covers the trials and tribulations of Americans like Bob Horner, who thrive on the diamond, but struggle off the field.  It covers the adverserial relationship between Japanese coaches and their foreign (Gai-jin) charges.  Any American going to work in Japan is well advised to pay attention!<br />How is Japan changing over time?  Compare how the approval of &quot;different&quot; antics of foreigners changes over time.  Learn how some Japanese players follow the model, but as the exception and not the rule.  Is the Japanese culture changing, or a surface appearance of change part of the Japanese character?  Read the book to find out.  Again, it's only about baseball on the surface.<br />How does training differ?  The American model suggests individuals can improve, but only to the limit of their ability.  The Japanese model in both the field and the office is that there is no limit - strength and success is limited only by effort.  This drive leads to a 10-11 month season counting training camp, as well as several hours of strenuous exercizes every day before practice.  This is essential to developing the fighting spirit.  Again, someone travelling to Japan for business is well advised to understand this.<br />The book is a must for baseball lovers as well as people interested in learning more about Japan.  The book is a fascinating work that hides great learning behind Japan under the story of America's pastime.	2003-03-10

They run from an unrealistic belief in advertising to mispaying top talent.  The solution - productivity, defined as producing more than what is used or input.    The author brings an interesting background to the story.  As founder of Beenz, he has seen the ups and downs of the so called New Economy.  Even at a young age, he's had more real life experience than most business writers, who seem to write more from the consultant's point of view.  In addition, the book has a refreshing non-American bent, which is unique in the high tech world.    The content is much deeper than \\"the New Economy was a sham\\" - it really does touch fundamental issues of business.  Corporate execs sometimes to do get on Mergers & Acquisitions sprees that are in their own interests, if not their shareholders.  Companies do sometimes spend a lot of energy on corporate citizenship, even if it's just PR.  Dealing with these vices is important for companies, and worth thinking about.    So why not 5 stars?  1 - The book claims that productivity is the only thing that's important.  That's kind of misleading based on his definition of productivity.  Maybe productivity is a simple thing to say, but it appears that the author was alternatively meaning efficiency of capital or positive cash flow.    2 - I think that it's dangerous and incorrect to oversimplify the business world as \\"Here's everything that's wrong, but if you follow this one plan/idea/metric...\\"  There is no silver bullet, and there is a reason that the market is right in the long term.  Productivity is important, but it's not the only thing.    Not rocket science, but nonetheless very worthwhile.  Still worth a read, even if it's now a bit dated.	2003-03-10

International focus has moved from Japan to China and back to Europe.  Many Japanese companies are now looking to the US for recapitalization and management assistance.<br />So why is a book on Japanese management techniques still so relevant?<br />First of all, continuous improvement and lean manufacturing have become universal management tools, not strictly limited to one country.  This book presents as good an introduction to the subject as any.  With today's focus on execution, this topic are becoming even more current.  (Dare I say topical?)<br />Additionally, understanding continuous improvement is still important in the context of broader corporate change.  What are the strength and limitations of incremental changes versus more radical corporate moves?  Read the book and learn more.<br />This book certainly won't turn a mediocre manager into a great leader, but Kaizen is a useful addition to the toolbox of any manager.	2003-03-03

It covers the isolation of Burma, the sex trade in Thailand, the night life in Nepal, and everything inbetween.  The book takes a deeper view beyond the stereotypes to understand the complexities of the cultural merging.<br />The book really has two main values.  First, it gives an annecdotal view of a lifestyle that, while only 15-20 years ago, is already gone.  Hong Kong 1986 is a place in transition that is different than Hong Kong today.  While many books today provide political and economic viewpoints on the times, and the changes, they don't accurately cover an expats view of life and cultural exchange.<br />The second value is in understanding aspects of the culture that still apply.  India's polyclot of ethnic groups and interaction with the West applies today.  Pico Iyer is adept at capturing cultural traits that last, and perhaps even grow, despite the pressures of a globalizing world.<br />I'm not a universal fan of all of Iyer's material, but this is certainly one of his better works.  It's more readable, and the concepts more universal and lasting than some of his other books.	2003-03-03

I was looking forward to either a biographical treatment of Ghosn, or detail on the turnaround.  In trying to handle both, the book slid into mediocrity.<br />The book covers Ghosn in a favorable light.  Greatness doesn't come from a good life.  I would have prefered to see more on the troubles Ghosn had to overcome.<br />The book also does not have enough time to go into detail on the turnarounds.  Ghosn's been through 4, and none had enough detail.  &quot;Cross Functional Teams&quot; is a fairly common management idea.  What did Ghosn do differently to make it work?  Breaking up the Japanese conglomerates was an enormous activity - the book made it seem a little too easy.<br />Again - great topic but weak treatment.	2003-01-28

I suspect the interviews are real, or at least the stories have a basis in fact.  Teenagers peddling false drugs...  Motorcyclists speeding through town on noisy bikes...

One extreme is the Lexus, symbolic of automation and modernization.  The other extreme is the Olive Tree - symbolic for the local fights.  Friedman presents Globalization as an inevitable trend, where the Lexus is winning, with some pullback from the Olive Tree.<br />The model presented is a complex one, more complete than presented in many scholarly texts.  Part of the pressure for globalization comes from a global herd of investores moving their money from country to country.  There's also an information dimension, where CNN can broadcast daily around the world.  Cultural influences are brought in as well.   Ultimately governments are forced into &quot;plugging in&quot; to globalization and it's rules because the global investment community will withdraw capital from governments that are poorly run.<br />Why is this relevant?  People from the &quot;Olive Tree&quot; camp are rapidly pushing globalization back.  It's important to understand why this is wrong.  It's also important to know how we can improve the lot of poorer nations by integrating them to the world economy.  Enfrachising poorer peoples is a much more effective (and perhaps inevitable) way of dealing with terrorism today than building barriers.<br />Consider the source - Friedman is the long time foreign affairs correspondant for the NY Times, and has lived abroad (including Jerusalem and Beiruit) for much of his life.  His writing is relatively unbiased, and presents a balanced view.<br />Any weak links?  <BR>- The book presents globalism as an inevitability, but history is proving him wrong.  Global foreign investment is actually going down.<BR>- Some governments (notably Malaysia and Chile) have successfully bucked the global investment community, which Friedman says shouldn't happen.<br />All in all it's still a very enlightening book, especially in a time when the world is getting smaller every day.	2002-12-04

On the surface, this is an interesting background biography of popular author Michael Crichton.  It covers his academic background at Harvard Medical School, follows his decision to drop out of modern medicine (interesting given that he produces TV series ER) and then follows him around the world.    Get past the biography and find a tale about exploring the world.  I read the book several years ago just as my eyes were starting to open to the world.  His adventures were a roadmap for expanding the mind through travel.    It's a very interesting travel log.  Are his experiences more clouded by a medical background, a writer's imagination or a desire to live as the locals?  In the end it's a remarkable tale of discovery, not so oversimplified as to ignore the pains of the road.  Think a medically trained Paul Theroux.    I highly recommend this book on both levels - to understand the author, and to encourage a broader worldview.	2002-12-04

Unfortunately, the content is somewhat repetitive and oversimplified, which detracts from the readability and credibility of the work.<br />Some of the observations that are right on:<BR>1 - Japan debt is massively understated due to off the books borrowing.<BR>2 - Japan's classical culture is in on the wane.<BR>3 - Japan's construction industry is in bed with politicians, creating a co-dependant relationship that is harming the economy.<BR>4 - The country's natural environment is suffering.<br />The book is off the mark on several areas, though.<BR>1 - Although there is an excess of construction, much of the country really has kept it's pristine nature.  The individuals also much more pro-environment than most Americans.<BR>2 - Although the economy is in bad shape, Japan has found a rapid ability to turn around in the past.  All is not lost.<BR>3 - Some of the core culture is dying, but Japan has a long history of adapting on the surface, while keeping core values.  This is not to be confused with an empty center that is tossing away history.<br />In summary, this is an important book about a complex subject.  The Japan of reality is very different than the Japan of pop culture, and it's captured here.  The book is worth reading, but repetitive parts should be skipped.	2002-12-04

He casts a favorable but critical eye on this complex culture.  This book captures the twist of his observations over time, first appreciating Japanese culture, but eventually wearying of it.  Perhaps its a cycle seen by many longtime Gaijin.<br />The writing covers a wide gamut of topics:  Art, Film (Donald Richie is the pre-eminant Gai-jin critic of Japanese movies), Culture, Society, and even sex.  It's truly a broad based reflection of a long time participant and observer in Japanese society.  The writing is crisp, refreshing, and unabashedly biased.

Anyone that is looking to improve longterm at a skill or vocation will find great use of this book.  (&amp; it's thin enough not to be too much of a waste of time if you disagree!)	2002-11-15

This is for the off-strip, I've been up for 72 hours, get me another beer, the light is too bright, let it ride crowd.  Likely the work that most accurately defines, or at least demonstrates, Gonzo journalism.    Hunter is at his best covering a race in the desert, attending a drug prevention convention (the irony!) and taking as much alternative substances as his body can handle.  And then some.  Lost in the world post-60s, he decries (with fear and loathing, of course!) what he sees happening as society backs off of \\"the high water mark\\".     It's a book about the falacy of the American Dream.  Vegas - land of illusion - is the perfect setting for a story that pops the balloon that is the American Dream.  Travel with Hunter, and you are there, parking the boat he calls a car onto the sidewalk.  You're there chatting it up with the law enforcement officers from Podunk Illinois.  You're hoping your ODing mammoth of a friend is calming down.    Sometimes runny, this gonzo journalism will surprise you with cutting observations of what is happening to society.  Awesome read, that will poke holes in your view of Americana.	2002-10-10

In a way, it's the &quot;Behind the Music&quot; of Long Term Capital (LTC).  <br />In very straightforward language, Lowenstein explains the background of both LTC and the hedge fund industry.  He walks through the broad economic enviornment, as well as the assumptions built in to the investment that LTC was making.  This is all heady work, but it's written in a way that the general reader can understand.<br />In the end, you'll understand the answers to the questions above.  You should also be a more informed reader of economics and business news too.  It's a quick read, and well worth the time.	2002-10-09

The authors cite ample research in the hard disk and other industries to track why most companies fail to anticipate the key changes in their markets.  <br />The very counterintuitive insight presented is that market leaders get trapped into listening to their current customers too much.  Current customers relatively satisfied with current products tend not to drive price/performance leaps.  The distruptions come from new companies that target ways of reaching low end customers that are considered too small for major players.  When the low end technology reaches a certain maturity, it winds up capturing the entire market.  Seems simple, but very few companies anticipate this.  The book walks through the research supporting this, as well as suggestions for how companies can cope.<br />The one knock...  The business climate is changing from a \\"Let's topple the market\\" to \\"Let's refine our business\\".  In the short term, we'll see less market making moves, and that will diminish the relevance of this book.  If the idea sticks to the next upwards trend, then Christiansen will have his place among the great gurus.<br />Do read the book.  I wish there was a 4.5 star rating to give.  You make the call.	2002-10-09

The book is an attempt to explain innovation through a highly hyped company.  Tom Peters calls IDEO &quot;the only other company I'd ever work for.&quot;  IDEO is famous for it's innovative work in improving high tech user interface design at companies like Apple and Microsoft.  It's on most &quot;Top Places to Work&quot; lists.<br />So the question begging to be asked are...<BR>Is this book about innovation or recruiting?<BR>And is IDEO really that good?<br />To answer the first, it seems a little bit of both.  Since the book is written by insiders, you'll get what they think the secret to success is.  Note - It's not an academic &quot;Here's how innovation works&quot; tome, it's &quot;Here's what we thinks works&quot;<br />As for IDEO really being that good?  The book will convince you that you want to work there.  Reality is IDEO has been hit by these troubled times like everyone else.  I'd be interested in what The Vault has to say about them now.<br />Is the book an interesting read on design and innovation?  Yes!<BR>Will it make you a great innovator?  Probably not.

It raises the complexity of this war, and presents the difficult but neccesary solutions.  You will scratch your head saying, \\"I never thought of it that way!\\"<br />Thomas Friedman understands what is going on in the world.  He's been an international correspondant for the New York times many years.  His first book, \\"From Beirut to Jersulam\\" was published over 10 years ago, and highlights the issues between the Isrealis and Palestinians.  As a longtime correspondent in both Beirut and Jerusalem, he had a unique vantage point to the conflict.  In \\"the Lexus and the Olive Tree\\" he explains the innevitability of globabilization and the value and danger of being plugged in to the global economic system.  This insight is drawn into his latest work.<br />The book is broken into three sections:<BR>- Columns immediately preceding 9/11<BR>- Columns immediately following 9/11<BR>- Assorted travel notes post/11 (somewhat redundant with #2)<br />Some of the key insights that were new to me:<BR>1 - In the 60s, Korea had the same per-capita standard of living as the Middle East.  Now it's eclipsed most of the middle east by 100%, largely as a result of modernization programs.  Even Saudi Arabia has seen it's per capita income drop by more than 50%<BR>2 - Much of the anti-American hatred in the Arab world is a result of a schooling system funded largely by Iranian and Saudi non-profits.  This educational system needs to be replaced with a more modern one.<BR>3 - We are dealing with a world in which the \\"Word on the street\\" in much of the Arab world believes 4,000 Jews received a warning not to go into work on 9/11.  This is a war of educating the street as much as it is about guns.<BR>4 - Iran a singificantly anti-American government.  It is no coincidence that the \\"Word on the street\\" is very pro-American as a result.<BR>5 - Israel offered the Palestinians 94% of the occupied territories in a peace deal, which Arafat refuted at Davos.  This cost the Prime Minister his election and brought Sharon to power.  <br />All of these points above are worth pondering.  They point to a world that is much more integrated and complex than meets the eye.  They require solutions much deeper than bombs and money.<br />In summary, the book is very important.  Thomas Friedman delves into the minds and history of our enemies.  He works to understand the problem more than \\"It's us against them, so stock up on the arms\\"  It is an immensely valuable book for understanding the world around us, and what our country needs to do.	2002-09-29

His ideas on prioritization, management and even business development have guided the principles behind planning and personnel management in both places.  Understanding the meaning behind the Covey-jargon has been a key to succeeding in both places.  Applying his lessons to non-work activities is the key to personal balance.<br />The first three habits are called private victories - controling one's own destiny.  (Be Proactive, Begin with the end in Mind and Put First Things First)  Seems obvious, but how often do we only look one step ahead?  When you hear someone ask, &quot;What are we really trying to accomplish here?&quot; you know you're on the way to beginning with the end in mind.<br />The next three are about public victories, increasing the performance of the group as a whole.  (Think Win/Win, Seek first to understand, then to be understood and Synergize)  This is about approaching life from a point of view of abundance - we are not trying to split a pie amongst ourselves, we are trying to understand each other and grow the pie.  Synergize, like re-engineering, has been bastardized in modern management vocabulary.  It has a very specific meaning here that does apply.<br />Sharpen the saw is the last habit, which is about continuous improvement and renewal.  This is especially vital in today's hyperspeed downsized environment.<br />Two other concepts included in the book are worth discussing:<BR>1 - Covey talks about building an emotional bank account with people.  Thinking about investing in relationships is a great way to move beyond treating interactions like transactions.<BR>2 - Covey divides the world into four quadrants of time management, encouraging us to focus our efforts on the high valued &quot;Important but not urgent&quot; quadrant 2 activities.  If you can introduce this lexicon into your workplace, it will add to your team's mutual time management.<br />I highly recommend this book to people looking to improve the organization, balance and effectivess of their work and personal lives.	2002-09-17

If you were able to learn the Theory of Constraints by ready the Goal, this a book that can imply some grander lessons about approaching life and business.<br />On the surface, the story is a fable about Komisar providing business advice to an internet funeral planning startup.  The lessons are deeper than &quot;What's a VC looking for?&quot;  I picked up two major concepts:<BR>1 - If you're not passionate about something, it's not worth doing, and you won't be able to convince others to join you. <BR>2 - It's not good to defer enjoyment of life - the journey has to be of value in addition to the destination.<br />These issues are brought up with two questions:<BR>1 - What would you be willing to do for the rest of your life?  Is the idea or change you're pursuing something that you'd be willing to do forever?  If so, it's worth doing.  If not, it's just another get rich quick scheme.<BR>2 - If you drop an egg 3 feet, how do you keep it from breaking?  This is the riddle in the title - I won't spoil the answer here, but it's different than what I thought (Boil it first!) and the key to concept 2 above.<br />Komisar's credentials to speak on this subject come from his varied background:  He was a lawyer &amp; CFO (hard numbers quant guy), a Virtual CEO and investor in high tech companies.  He lived what he speaks, and comes from a &quot;hard skills&quot; background.  This adds credibility to his discussion of softer subjects.<br />This is a great book for anyone wondering, &quot;Why am I doing this?&quot; or &quot;Should I be doing something new?&quot;  It delves into &quot;Why do we get into a business?&quot;  I highly recommend this profound, but practical read.	2002-09-09

The book defends individual excellence and reason as the drivers of progress in society, and demonstrates what happens when society's leaders refuse to be beasts of burden.<br />Atlas Shrugged can be of assistance in understanding the world that we live in:<BR>1 - The Dot Com boom - Many dot commers are believers in Ayn Rand, and hold her up as the model for which they strive.  This is ok, but let's remember that she is against anti-trust laws, and would tell the government to leave Microsoft alone.<BR>2 - Alan Greenspan was a follower of Ayn Rand.  Although she is considered pro-greed, it's interesting to hear him speak out against it.<BR>3 - Japan is a country that is run by administrative guidance from above, and although it's not a communist &quot;People's state&quot; it is suffering from much in the book.<BR>4 - Enron and Worldcom are considered sources of greed inspired by Ayn Rand.  I'll contend that they were build not by reason, but by governmental influence, and should not be held up as examples of the result of her thinking.<br />The book slows dramatically when the main character, John Galt (who leads the strike of the thinkers), gives his speech to the world.  Conventional wisdom is that you don't need to read the whole speech - it's just a rerun of the book.  Nobody told me that wisdom, and that stumbling block added a few weeks to the read.<br />In general, the book celebrates the individual who strives for excellence by using reason to create progress.  This holds true, but has limits in the real world.  Despite great intentions, people need to make compromises and make sacrifices in the name of the system.  (Systems thinkers would say that overemphasis on local performance kills the system as a whole)  There are detractions to the book, but it posits a profound thought that everyone should understand.  Feel free to agree or disagree with her conclusions, but learn what she is saying.  Just skip the John Galt speech when the going gets slow.	2002-09-09

Mick, the detective, is searching for the truth.

You will read it in one sitting, and immediately crave the next from masterful new author Lawrence Christopher.	2002-08-13

This may be the most inaccesible management book I've ever read.  I picked it because of Shewart's exalted position in the quality movement - as the mentor and intellectual guide to Deming, he is the theorist behind the quality of our cars, VCRs and televisions.<br />Unfortunately, his writing is enormously hard to read and apply.  The mathematics were very hard to penetrate - dozens of pages to even get to basing control charts on standard deviations.  I've got a minor in mathematics, so I was suprised by the difficulty.  It was near impossible to derive quality lessons from the book.<br />In deference to the author, I'll make a lot of excuses for him:<BR>- It was written a long time ago.<BR>- The book was aimed at statisticians, not managers.<BR>- A compilation of Shewart's ideas would be more effective than lecture notes.<br />My end recommendation - browse before you buy.	2002-08-13

In today's economy, this is what we need.<br />The authors bring distinct viewpoints:  Larry Bossidy has the hardnosed viewpoints of a product of the GE management machine.  He lived through the GE execution culture and reapplied it at the Honeywell.  Ram Charan displays the broader view of a business school professor with extensive senior level consulting.<br />The book starts with a self evident description of why execution is needed.  It moves into the types of behaviors a leader should exhibit, and how they set up the framework for change.  It concludes with the three major processes an execution oriented leader should run: people, strategy and operations.<br />Yes - the book is generic, but it has to be to reach a broad audience.  The concept of focusing on all 3 areas:  people, strategy and operations is obvious, but important.  In the context of calling them processes - it becomes a discipline.  The general management focus and need for ongoing persistance is valuable to people of all levels.<br />There are some interesting ties to other management gurus.  Tom Peters - as outlandish as he may be - is also big on getting things done.  Deming's quality approach is ultimately about application.  Collins in Built to Last focuses on execution - the steady and stable leader trumps the charistmatic showpiece.  The ideas developed here have been building for some time.  Their time to come to the front of every executive's thought is now.<br />The book does have a few knocks:<BR>- If Bossidy built such a great culture for success at Honeywell, why did it fall apart immediately after his exit?<BR>- Is there any hard research behind this?  (With a former Harvard and Kellogg alum, you'd expect some)<BR>- There is much less focus on the customers than one would expect.<br />Despite these small misgivings, this is most definitely a useful read for any manager or aspiring leader.	2002-08-13

This book helps one navigate the strange world of French wine - where the land is more important than the type of grape. <br />The books starts with several chapters on why French wine is considered such high quality, and what the history is behind it. Here's you'll learn about the history and categorizations of wine, as well as overview of the archaic & mind-numbing labelling system.<br />The second section covers France's high profile wine regions, including Bordeaux, Burgundy & Beautjolais.  If all you know about Bordeaux and Burgundy is, \\"They ain't in Napa\\", you're in the same boat as me, and the book can give you some guidance.<br />The third part covers France's other wine regions, including a section on Champaigne.   (Champaigne does count as wine - another lesson for me!)  This is helpful if you're traveling in France and want to know what local wines to try.<br />The book closes with answers to commonly asked questions about French wine, as well as exposing one to the myths of French wine.<br />Overall, the book is a great primer and eduational tool for the novice at French wine. (Or wine in general!) It'll help you with the history and feel of the French wine industry. Perhaps it can guide you at the wine shop, though likely not as much as knowledgable individual.<br />It passes the, \\"Would I bring it with me to France?\\" test.

The book takes you through the world of Andre Parent, a writer who travels Africa and Europe, living the surface life of an upstanding individual, concealing the secret life of an energized sexually charged vagabond.<br />Chapter 1 (Altar Boy) is about Andre's coming of age, and outgrowing his parents expectations.<br />Chapter 2 (Whale Steaks) covers his oscilation between his love of a slightly older girlfriend, and his fascination with someone from his parent's generation.<br />Chapter 3 (African Girls) talks about his adventures in the peace corps, largely oriented around sleeping with the local girls.<br />Chapter 4 (Bush Baby) is the continuing story of his adventures, including some encounters with a V.S. Naipul lookalike.  (Interesting as Naipul was a major influence on Theroux's career)<br />Chapter 5 (Leaving Siberia) has a double meaning.  It is about Parent physically leaving Siberia on a travel writing trip, and an emotional exit from Siberia after learning of his wife's infidelity.<br />Chapter 6 (Two of Everything) is about the double life that Parent lives - one with his wife, and another with his mistress.  It chronicles an identical trip through India with both women.  This is an example of him becoming what he had previously abhored.<br />The book is well written on several levels.  It vividly takes you into the peace corps, and through Africa.  It also has a lot of subtly, as the character first repeats his own mistakes, and then repeats the mistakes he dislikes in others.  The disappointment with his eventual success (be careful what you ask for as you might get it) on both the large and small levels are told with a straight face, adding to the believability of the character.<br />The book is 500 pages of a quick energizing read.  Well worth the time invested.	2002-06-28

On an academic level, this is fraught with peril - How do we know these are the right CEOs, and do they really articulate what makes them succeed? <br />Business books have a history of weak scholarship (think In Search of Excellence) but still can contain great ideas.<br />The 10 less than profound results:<BR>1 - Be Yourself, Unless You're a Jerk<BR>2 - See Around Corners<BR>3 - Make Dust or Eat Dust<BR>4 - Make the Big Play<BR>5 - Keep Good Company<BR>6 - Be the Number One Fund Raiser and Protecter<BR>7 - Act Like a CEO When You Don't Feel Like It<BR>8 - Evangelize the World<BR>9 - Go Big or Go Home<BR>10 - Cut Through the Junk<br />All this is good advice, but did you need to ask 100 CEOs to come up with it?<br />Ultimately, the book resides in my restroom.

The story builds on the theory as the manager applies the theory to turn around his factory.<br />What's the theory?:  <BR>Organizations tend to suboptimize systems locally, often at the expense of the system as whole.  Maximizing the benefit of the system as a whole means tracing problems to root causes, or bottlenecks spanning organizations.  <br />How is it applied?:  <BR>In a factory, many departments or machines are fine tuned for efficiency.  This means keeping lots of inventory around to keep the machines running fulltime, even if the product isn't needed.  The solution - begin with what's important for a factory - getting money for finished products, and minimizing money tied up in inventory.  Then drive out efficiency in the system as a whole by attacking bottlenecks one at a time.  Local measures cease to be as important.<br />How does this apply to Just in Time and Total Quality Management?:<BR>Just In Time's inventory reduction is consistent with the approach of holding just enough inventory to keep the system tuned.  Total Quality Management is a process focused approach.  This ties in to approaching bottlenecks with the end in mind.<br />On a personal level, this was the first management book I read in the working world.  It was given to me by our local &quot;Quality&quot; expert, and I read it in a night.  I highly recommend it as a first for you too.  If you're into more theory and less story, you may be better served by one of his other books.	2002-05-08

Is it about the military, or achieving victory with the mind?  Was Sun Tzu really a general?  Did he really behead 50 maidens for not taking his military drills seriously?  (The next 50 were more serious students - motivation!)<br />Independent of the truth of the legend, the truths in this book are worth pondering.<br />Take one piece of advice, roughly paraphrased as,<br />\\"Know thy self, win some of the time.<br /> Know thy enemy, win some of the time.<br /> Know both thy self and thy enemy, and win all of the time\\"<br />At the surface, this is so obvious as to not be profound.<br />But look at it's applicability...<br />How many companies worry so much about their competitors that they don't understand what they're good at?  To defeat a corporate competitor, you must know your competitive advantage.<br />How many people think, \\"This purchase is in my best interest, so I'll buy it\\" without considering the price.<br />How many politicians are willing to say, \\"It doesn't matter what the Al Quada was thinking, it was wrong, so we must bomb them\\"  How can we truly beat them if we don't understand them?<br />There are literally hundreds of these truths to ponder - so obvious until you look at how infrequently they're done.<br />This ancient wisdom is worth more than reading, it's worth understanding.	2002-05-07

Cultural Lesson?<BR>All of the above!<br />This is an incredible work on numerous levels.<br />On the surface, it's a historical fiction about the power struggles in Feudal Japan as the country comes to grips with Western influence.  Lord Toronaga is a fictional character based on Tokugawa, the 3rd major unifier of feudal Japan.<br />On a second level, the book sets the stage for Clavell's Asian Saga.  Seeds are planted here that appear throughout his novels.<br />On a third level, the book is a treasure of Japanese culture.  For those new to Japanese culture, the behaviors and interactions of the characters seems very foreign.  Even back then, how could civilized people think like that?  Guess what - they think like that now too!  And Blackthorne - the prototypical Gai-jin - he set the standard for foreigners struggling in that culture.<br />On a personal level, this is a book that grew with me.  It fueled an interest in Japanese culture and history.  In the years following my first pass of Shogun, I read quite a bit of Japanese history, and saw the accuracy of the story.  Later, when I lived in Japan, I found my understanding of the culture radically improved by the lessons learned in the book.  <br />And to think, I bought this because &quot;I need a thick book to pass time on all these plan rides!&quot;	2002-04-12

Get a leg up on what they're thinking.<br />The long answer:<BR>When Built to Last came out, I saw the CEO's secretary on the elevator with her arms full with copies of it.  At my new company, the CEO sent a memo out to his reports highlighting the deep thought of the book.  Fad or Fact - you need to know what the people up above are thinking.<br />What's it about?<BR>&quot;Build to Last&quot; was about how to infuse a company with the value and culture to have outstanding returns.  &quot;Good to Great&quot; is the book for the rest of us - we're working at or with &quot;Good&quot; companies that want &quot;Great Performance&quot;.  The benchmark - stock market performance.  The author charts how companies stuck in mediocrity make that leap to greatness.  The book compares them to similar companies, which don't make that leap.<br />Anything original?  <BR>You bet!  There are several counterintuitive insights in the book:<br />1 - Companies that make the transition get the right people on board before changing strategies.  (You'd think strategy would drive the people you hire, no?)<BR>2 - The CEOs responsible for the dramatic improvements were low-key insiders, not high profile outsiders.  (No bidding wars for the GE #2s)<BR>3 - The changes tended to be the result of repetition of good things, not a huge strategic change.  (The flywheel concept)<BR>4 - Technology supports the change, but doesn't lead it.<br />Is the research real?  <BR>I'm inclined to say yes.  The book is the result of painstaking quantitative research.  Companies were identified based on rigorous stock market performance - certainly a higher criteria than used for &quot;In Search of Excellence\\" A side note is that many hard research business books are bad reads - this book flows very quickly.<br />Any knocks?  <BR>The one credibility hit is that several companies that were dubbed &quot;Built to Last&quot; are struggling.  This highlights that Collins is not one of those genius's that's &quot;Always Right&quot;.  (Neither it Tom Peters, but it's still great reading)<br />So buy the book, get in your boss's head, and anticipate the changes to improve your organization.	2002-04-11

Galapagos is the latest novel that I've read, and (like the rest of his) immediately becomes my favorite.<br />The premise of the book is that humanity is going to make an enormous change of genetic course due in part to it's own stupidity.  The onion is peeled, and the story reveals more about the problems in humanity while following the story of the future common parents of mankind.<br />The book maintains several consistencies with Vonnegut's other works:<BR>- A witty style that covers sharp criticism.  (Like they've said of Twain, &quot;They'd hang him if they thought he was serious&quot;)<BR>- A satire that's sometimes obvious, but sometimes hiding behind the story.<BR>- Cameos by characters from his other books.<BR>- A solid criticism of modern societyu	2002-04-08

This book is a practical guide to winning the \\"battle\\", whether that's a political campaign, a business, or anything.<br />The advice is organized into simplistic chapters, such as \\"Kiss Ass\\", \\"Kick Ass\\" and \\"Frame the Debate\\".  The chapters use interesting and humorous anecdotes to explain the ideas.  This is roll up the sleeves advice for how to make things happen.  The context is political, the application much more universal.<br />As one might imagine, the book has strong liberal pro-Clinton leanings.  YOU don't need to be card carrying democrat to get a lot from the book.  If you're a Carville fan, you'll appreciate the editiorial comments more.  If you're a die hard Republican, learn from these guys and get the last laugh.  Read a chapter a day and you'll be better for it.<br />p.s.

What vision!<br />Vonnegut writes this amazing novel from a pre-Internet, pre-Information Revolution, pre-Overautomated era.  It is based a post-war society that is run by technocrats - an elite group of managers and engineers who year over year gradually improve and automate society. <br />The story explores the moral choices presented to a society, and the institutions required to maintain an ever-improving status quo.  The protagonist is a budding technocrat struggling with his place in this dehumanizing society.  He struggles with a wife he claims to love, a duty he feels obligated to live up to, and a sense that something is deeply wrong.<br />The agitation, and revolutionary action in the novel speaks to many times.  It speaks to a fear of automation in a pre-technical society.  It also talks to the activism in the 60s, with a message of \\"Rebel even if you can't succeed\\".  It also speaks to today's world, where every choice presented to us seems to be filtered through numerous technologies...<br />This was a very quick read, a very entertaining read, and a very insightful read.  It put words to ideas that it drew from within me.  It's timeless message does great justice to the author's reputation.	2002-04-05

Call him what you will, but Chomsky is provacative.  <BR>He pulls back the covers of a dirty world to look into the causes of the 9-11 tragedy.  Readers familiar with him will see the \\"Kissinger as Devil\\" slant of Chomsky's writing.  <br />If you're from the far left, this book will clarify your thoughts and provide ammunition for your convictions.  If you're from the far right, know thine enemy.  And if you're in the middle - learn with an open mind.<br />Ups on the book:<BR>1 - If it's your first read of Chomsky, you'll scratch your head asking, \\"Are we really that bad?\\"<BR>2 - He's willing to challenge the status quo.<BR>3 - We need multiple viewpoints on the world.<br />Knocks on the book:<BR>1 - Chomsky has a habit of masking controversial topics by calling ideas, \\"Common knowledge\\"<BR>2 - The consistency of his ultra-left slant takes the edge off the originality of some of his insights.<BR>3 - The timing and cover of the book could be construed as opportunism.<br />I'll forgive the apparent opportunism and slant, because Chomsky does make me think.  I'll keep reading him.	2002-04-05

I'm neither an MBA, nor an Investment Banker, but I certain felt like one reading the book.<br />The book reads like a &quot;Behind the Music&quot; of 2 investment bankers.  It follows them from business school, into a hectic life of investment banking, and eventually their fall from the business.  The story follows a predictable pattern, but I enjoyed following along for the ride.<br />This isn't high literature, but it's an entertaining read that will take you to an environment you may not know.	2002-04-05

It is a psychological work by Bellow, getting in the head of a man coming to grips with his mid-life failures.  It also shows his relationships with a tough love (or just tough?) father, and manipulative friends.  As you read it, you struggle between repulsion, sympathy and identification with the lead character. <br />The book is very accessible and easy to read given the intellectual pedigree of the author.  Even still, one is left at the end wondering, &quot;What did I miss?&quot;  While the reader may be left perplexed, it is a sign of the depth of material pushed into such a short novel.<br />I'm left thinking, &quot;It's a good, deep book&quot; - perhaps a more in tune reader would find it a great one.	2002-04-03

This book highlights why. It is a treatise on the fundamentals of jiu jitsu.<br />Before jumping into technique, the book starts with history and philosophy of jiu jitsu. This is extremely important for all interested in the art. <br />The technique section contains detailed descriptions of many classical jiu jitsu moves. For the novice, they are a step by step walk through for how to practice and learn the techniques. For the experienced jiu jitsu player, they are a reminder of the details that separate success from failure in execution.<br />The book is organized by belt level - blue, purple, brown and black.  The reality is some of these moves will be new to you, and some will be old hat.  On the ones you've seen before, you should be able to pick up some details you had missed previously.  I found the self defense techniques to be particularly helpful, as that's something that can get easily neglected.<br />The book was the vision of Kid Peligro, the world's premier martial arts journalist.

Ideas that he plugged (Turn all work into a project, outsource, turn everything into a profit center) don't really seem so crazy.  His mantra of speed certainly fit the period we just went through.

This book is an interesting take on the problems inherent in globalization.  (Think the Argentinean default)<br />Soros has distinct credentials to write on the subject:<BR>1 - He's made quite a bit of money (Billions) off of currency speculation.<BR>2 - He has financed numerous foundations attempting to resolve the problems described.<br />The book makes for interesting reading to the non-economist, in that it explains the WTO, World Back, IMF and other international organizations supporting global development.  It defends their success against their missions, while highlighting the deficiencies.  Soros admits the complexity of the problem, and proposes several solutions.<br />There were two major weak spots in the book:<BR>1 - His concept of Special Drawing Rights could use more explanation.  Identical descriptions occur 3 times, but none are accessible to the lay reader.<BR>2 - He makes blanket accusations against &quot;market fundamentalism&quot; without defining it, or explaining why it continues to be the dominant view.<br />Bottom line:  If you're looking for a high level explanation of the issues with globalization and the key international organizations involved, this is the book for you.  If you're looking for clear resolutions, this may prove elusive.	2002-03-31
