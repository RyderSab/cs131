John Farris pulls out a classic....<br /><br />I've read many of John Farris's novels and stories over the years but I was not prepared for how this left me, days after in fact. Stories rarely come this well written anymore. The bestsellers you see in the stores rarely come close to this<br /><br />storytelling greatness yet John Farris remains obscure? I just love to sink into a period story(this one from the 50's)with such detail and with a touch beyond the grave. Excellent story. Reminds me how I felt when I read the great Joe R. Lansdale's classic tales 'THE BOTTOMS' and 'A FINE DARK LINE' which both have similar themes and terrific storytelling magic. This is sure to be one of the best of the 2005.	2005-07-20

Just received this this week,(good way to start the new year) and I'm impressed with this book but I'm not surprised with<br /><br />anything that Al Sarrantonio put his hands to. What a cast of<br /><br />characters that deliver these stories. I'm just finishing up<br /><br />the great American East Texas storyteller Joe R. Lansdale and<br /><br />his new story, \\"Bill, the little steam shovel\\" and its nothing<br /><br />like I've read by Joe before but its so good, so like Joe Lansdale in its detail, humor and vision. This anthology  has<br /><br />so many great stories and what a list of who's who... Orson Scott Card, Joyce<br /><br />Carol Oats, Neal Barrett jr., Charles De Lint,  P.D. Cacek,<br /><br />Robert Silverberg, Nina Hoffman, Neil Gaiman, David Morrell,<br /><br />Ray Feist as well as the above master story teller Joe Lansdale<br /><br />this is a great way to spend extra time around the holidays!<br /><br />Pick your favorites!	2004-12-31

I've been buying her books for years and I find her to be<br /><br />one of the best there is. At times an aquired taste but she tackles many subjects and is<br /><br />brillant at the little details and gets inside people like know<br /><br />other. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something different in the mystery/suspense vain and she just<br /><br />makes London so real, so dead gloomy. A great book from a master story teller. Serial murder with a twisted psychogical edge with characters so real yet very flawed inside. She just<br /><br />loves to lead us on..	2004-12-23

I came across this one at my local Walmart superstore while<br /><br />waiting for an oil change and started reading just the first<br /><br />few pages and I was glued to the story right there in the paperback isle. Not to many<br /><br />write like Ed Gorman, he like another favorite of mine, Joe R.<br /><br />Lansdale deliver stories that cover so many genres but they<br /><br />just know how to write good stories and always give us characters that are real and have something to say. Ed Gorman<br /><br />has given us great mysteries,thrillers and some chillers, westerns and<br /><br />stories like this one, like the screenwriters try to do for TV(everyone seems to<br /><br />be so caught up with all the detective/ crime/ forensic dramas), Ed Gorman writes rings around all that stuff, he should<br /><br />be writing these scripts and making the millions??<br /><br /> Loved by a loyal cult of readers and admired by all the great<br /><br />writers for years,  this story<br /><br />hopefully will give Ed more reasons to wake up in the morning<br /><br />and keep writing his next bestseller. Well worth reading into<br /><br />the night, as I've been doing.	2004-12-21

Just received this book yesterday and sorting my way through<br /><br />some familiar and the off the wall gems. When you pick up Joe R.<br /><br />Lansdale short stories you won't find the same old stories,<br /><br />you'll find some good life lessons and hard luck, some shock<br /><br />and laughs and down home tales, usually from a very twisted perspective at times. Always top notch stories. I especially<br /><br />enjoyed joe's expanded novel several years ago, \\"THE BIG BLOW\\", with everybody's eyes wide open to hurricanes(this year) this is a good time<br /><br />to read Joe's take on the most massive early century hurricane and the story of a boxer's inner battles. The combination is a knockout! Also included is one of my two very favorite Lansdale<br /><br />yarns, (novella size also) called \\"Mad Dog Summer\\", which is about as good a story to read as they come by, Lansdale style.<br /><br />This is a newer turn Joe's taken off the path over the past several years. Stylized from a generation or two once removed, writing in a vein much like the great Lee novel, \\"To kill a mockingbird\\" yet purely all Lansdale, this is an award winning novella(as was the full length fully realized \\"The Bottoms\\"(Edgar Award winner) from which this was spawned, a story that you won't soon<br /><br />forget and I'm glad its the title tale and back out. This should be standard reading in all schools across this country,<br /><br />its that good,(should have won a Pulitzer for such a compeling<br /><br />piece of fiction). Even though Joe's moved away from some of his earlier shock and awe tales, he never quite lets us off<br /><br />the hook when it comes to in your face gritty reality and that to me<br /><br />has always been one of his greatest gifts, he know how to pack a big punch with his words without going overboard with 1000 page novels (and short stories).  These stories are made to be savored and read<br /><br />many times over the years, enjoy them, I sure am. Its also nice to see Joe pay tribute to his mother and share his views at the<br /><br />same time. Joe's a BIG supporter of children and it all starts<br /><br />with good parents-teachers and values, another reason I've always found<br /><br />his stories to be REAL, regardless of their style./>same time.

With so much of the same old crap stirring around the top<br />of the bestseller sewer system of retreds its nice to find<br />another Lansdale winner waiting in the wings for its share of<br />crumbs. This book looks to challange readers with its less than<br />glamourous stylings but so full of heart, wit and yes substance,<br />this book actually has something to say(don't most Lansdale<br />yarns leave you with something to think about??) I really enjoyed these characters and the time and place they are set in.  I could not turn the pages quick enough and the spicy, tangy Lansdale one liners find themselves all over and he can make you laugh and cringe all at the same time. What an opening of a book!  Joe is like<br />no writter I've come across. He doesn't try to make things any<br />more complicated than he needs to yet he takes you right back<br />to a time earlier in our history (1930's) and gives us Sunset,<br />who like an earlier reviewer stated would make a great stand-alone series like the Hap & Leonard series. Sassy, brave & headstrong and ahead of her time for sure(she's a mean shooter), Sunset is unforgettable. But wait to you meet<br />the rest of these assorted characters from the brilliant Lansdale imagination. If I ever get another dog it will be just like \\"Ben\\".  I'm hoping people who come upon this gem will also find his last two must have's \\"The Bottoms\\" and \\"A Fine dark line\\",(not to mention his short stories \\"HIGH COTTON\\", this guy is heading for more than just bestseller status, he will be remembered longer than the 15 mins. most of these kiss and tell & tired old same old same old writers were're force fed at every bookstore, Walmart, you name it.  Lansdale's the real deal and I look forward to his superlative writings(and maybe one day meeting the man himself at a book signing!) Like<br />\\"Ben\\", theres lots to like about this one.	2004-04-03

This was a book I took a chance with, I hadn't heard of this<br />author except I did see his first one going through Amazon.com<br />and I passed it buy. Something about this one, I bought it<br />at Kmart of all places, those eyes just caught me on the cover.<br />Plus it was guaranteed if you did not like it you could get<br />your money back or something to that effect.  For the book review-<br />Right from the start you couldn't put this winner down. I read<br />for hours and hours and there were scenes in this book that<br />really gave me the chills. I love the terror build up and<br />the characters were put in a situation that just grew more<br />and more desperate.  Great book, I haven't had a good scare<br />ride like this in ages.  This book WILL be nominated for the<br />Bram Stoker Award again this year and I'd say it looks to be<br />right up there with Brian Keene's &quot;The Rising&quot;,(loved them both) excellent<br />new books to close yourself off from the world!

The original was so wild, bizzare, zanny,twin peakishly<br />errie.(I have the two videos of the original THE KINGDOM and I will watch these again, they were so brillant but with the strange artistic touches of the danish writers(swedes right across the water)who knows? This was great stuff, I do remember that little girl, very well done, errie.  I am looking forward to all this playing out but start<br />I guess with these journals and try and find &quot;THE KINGDOM&quot; parts<br />1 and 2 and see it for yourself. I'm sure Stephen King with his<br />distrubing as ever brillant mind will find ways to take this<br />to places that the original deserved to go, then we can have<br />both to compare.

Wright has over the year crept up to being one of my<br />favorite subtle chiller authors. His better novels(they're all good, the ones I've found and read), incluing this spooky gem, give the reader a real reason<br />for seeking out tales like this. I shut the house up tight and<br />put many candles on, and stayed in for the night and took<br />this one in, like the last reviewer stated, it stays with you<br />long after you've finished.

Al Sarrantonio is yet another master of the short story medium<br />I have come to appreciate of late. Thanks to Joe R. Lansdale(my very favorite short story writer!(and the introduction to this<br />collection) As a past reviewer stated perfectly I can't seem<br />to get enough short stories lately, but I do try and read novels<br />when I have time. They both are perfect ways to spend some time.  Short stories can have so much impact, I've<br />found some great short story collections recently  from the likes of Jack Ketchum, Peter Crowther, P.D Cacek, Neil Gaiman, Simon Clark, Ray Bradbury(the godfather of these stories), the dark masques, and darker masques series of late and of course my favorite, HIGH COTTON which I<br />believe is a must have from Joe R. Lansdale, for your short story<br />collection.  TOY BOX has a great cover to wet the appetite for<br />this strange weirdness you are about to discover. Autumn is the perfect time of the year to sit back and<br /> discover this gifted storyteller. There are so many talented writers out there to discover and stories to take you away.

Reality<br />and dreams slide in and out but the characters and the writing<br />style keep you glued to this story. Morris has created a world<br />slowly disintergrating into loss of all reason but with all its gloom I found<br />it enjoyable just trying to figure it all out and the ending<br />which I will not give away matched the flow to conclusion. Morris is a talent to keep an eye on. I would recommend this<br />to mystery/horror readers and yes those that like the David<br />Lynch touch of violence and gothic menace with  a disjointed<br />seam traveling through the story that makes more sense with<br />its conclusion.	2003-07-22

Sure some of this sounds far-fetched but Joy Fielding  along with Mary Higgins Clark were at the top of women writers in the 80's  given readers chilling suspense and a good fast read. It seems now a days  all these stories they wrote about so well, have been put through the mill  and rehashed a million times over.  I guess when you look back they may  seem somewhat tame and maybe even dull compared to what they write about  these days but I still remember this story and reading it till 4AM till  finished and enjoying it, thats what readings about. Its really not as bad  as many of the reviewers claim.	2000-08-04

Well I managed to obtain an Advanced Readering Copy of this novel and I just plain shut myself away from everything for a couple days and absorbed this story. I had read some press releases about this being his  breakthrough book and well anyone out there that loves mystery stories  dealing with the south and during the depression, told through the eyes of  a young boy coming of age in a time when life was a struggle but each day  brought excitement and adventure as well as constant changes and sadness.  I don't need to tell much about this great story except I couldn't put it  down and it has touches of many great classic stories about the south and  the hatered and prejudices which were a way of live and the struggles of  comman families trying to make ends meet. I just loved the boy Harry and  his kid sister &quot;Tom&quot;  but the cast of characters in this book  were especially  well thought out. The &quot;Goat Man&quot;, Grandma,  Harry's Mom and Dad &quot;the barber shop&quot; the river bottoms, the  shacks, dead bodies, squirrels, and Toby to mention a few, all add up to  one of the most interesting and classic books I've read in many a year. My  other personal favorite of Joe's &quot;Mucho Mojo&quot; from his excellent  mystery series surrounding Hap and Leonard and their wacky friendship and  the troubles they find themselves getting into in East Texas. Still my very  favorite author, thanks Joe for this new story and the life you've created  in the young boy, Harry and giving us back a time in our countries earlier  days that many younger people just never knew about and for your awsome way  of telling your stories!	2000-07-28

My first book getting to know James Herbert and I must say this British writer is in a class all by himself. I picked this paperback up on a wimp (written mid 70's) and started reading and could not put it down until I  finished it, well into the night. I'll  also ad I will never look at rats  the same way again. This book really distrubed me and chilled me, yet I've  discovered a new favorite Horror/Thriller author who actually writes  visually and you can feel every detail. This guy really knows his stuff and  in my opinion writes just as good as any of &quot;The KINGS&quot;, its  great to read a book that is so finely crafted yet will make your skin  crawl. Nice change of pace.	2000-06-24

I just took this book  for what it was meant to be, not a masterpiece of literature but a  resourseful, gay novel with characters I cared about and a positive message  from a gay view point and we need more books that show gay men with many  emotions both positive and negative, strong as well as weak. Human men  during a time when our country was under constant threat from all her  borders. The sexual encounters were very well written and understated for  the mind of the reader, that was a big plus in this book as well as the  suspense and human emotions. I just plain enjoyed this book, enough said!	1999-12-07

I don't think I have picked up a Lansdale book I haven't liked, this guy has got to be the most diverse writer and dare I say brilliant. So many stories up his sleeve, always strange but thats my kinda writer. I wish  they would make some of these into an X-files like Friday nite series  staring these characters Hap and Lenoard with every week a new mystery to  unturn.  This story was a fast read and right to the point, don't bother  trying to analysis Joe's stuff its great fun!	1999-12-05

This world that these two main characters live in, although at times depressing and hard to swallow, also kept me up most of the night to finish. I gave this 5 stars because it was well written for all the strange  goings on and I felt for the young boxer and the older man, it did touch me  and thats why I seek out books like this for. Well worth the time.	1999-12-04

I read this book (just finished) and wanted to review it while its fresh on my mind.  I thought the book was very enlightning, to say the least and  I really felt for joe steffan, they don't make guys like this anymore.  Where he could very well have just kept his mouth shut, he chose to stand  up for himself, I wish I had more of his courage and perseverance. Thanks  to men and women like himself, this issue will keep being  chipped away at  and this book is a testament that good, honest people come in all types;  straight, gay, black, white, short, tall and they need to be judged by  their merits and work ethics  whatever the job deems, thats what counts.	1999-11-01

I enjoyed this for what it was, some day  Bonnie will sit down and tell all but until then I just get off on her  music and the great human being she is. That is all you need to know, just  listen to what her song say to the heart and mind.	1999-08-05

This is the first book that I picked up (very accidental) a good cover will draw your eyes! by Joe Lansdale. I had not picked up a book to read for several years and this book re-opened my eyes to the adventures of  reading and what can happen when you are drawn into characters so well  thought out and totally entertaining. A spooky and loveable story and what  a stew of a mystery about two male friends,(one straight, and one gay) an  inherited old house, something dead under the floor boards. This is a GREAT  STORY and I am so glad I came apon this talented writer from Texas.	1999-03-28

I just wanted to say i think this is such a great showcase for horror writers both new and older. Although i haven't finished all the stories i must say my favorites so far, the excellent Joe R. Lansdale and Pobby Z. Brite and Christa Faust. I would also say Douglas E. Winter should be commended for his choice selections and vision.	1998-03-09

I have started reading her books during the past several months thanks to the internet and the many horror links. I found this book to be much more than i bargained for, this lady is a great dark horror writer and because the subject matter may not be for everyone it still shouldn't stop you from one great read! bon' apetit!!!	1998-02-17
