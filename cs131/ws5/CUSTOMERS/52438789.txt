A temporary pacemaker was<br />forcing his damaged heart to beat - operating at power levels that<br />would poison every cardiac muscle fiber with electrochemical by-<br />products, in 15 or 20 minutes at the most.  Pre-oxygenated ersatz blood<br />was being fed to his heart's left atrium, in lieu of a supply from the<br />lungs, pumped thru the body once only, then removed via the<br />pulmonary arteries and discarded.  An open system was less trouble<br />than recirculation, in the short term.  The half-repaired knife wounds<br />in his abdomen and torso made a mess, leaking thin scarlet fluid into<br />the drainage channels of the operating table...\\"<br /><br />It's 2055.  Reporter Andrew Worth is covering the temporary revival of<br />a murder victim.<br /><br />[quote] His expression shifted rapidly;  thru the pain there was a sudden flash<br />of pure astonishment, then an almost amused comprehension of the<br />full strangeness - and maybe even the perverse virtuosity - of the feat<br />to which he'd been subjected.  For an instant, he really did look like<br />someone admiring a brilliant, vicious, bloody practical joke...<br />Then Daniel Cavolini... began to scream.

Set 5,000 years from now, a post-collapse Earth supports static \\"mite\\" cultures, secretly dominated by the spacegoing nanotech Rykasha \\"demons\\". Modesitt's themes include (surprise!) ecology, personal responsibility;  and passive, fatalistic (\\"eastern\\") vs. dynamic (\\"western\\") culture.<br /><br />A nice setup, but flabby execution: Gravity Dreams starts out so slowly that I almost gave up (and kinda wish I had). About 75 pages in (\\"Sciamachy\\"), the pace picks up, but once the protag enters starpilot flight school... well, I learned far more about needleship [note 1] flight training than I'd *ever* want to know. \\"It's a sin to waste the reader's time\\" -- LvC Niven.<br /><br />Gravity Dreams would have made a nice novella, but there just isn't enough substance here to fill 400 pages. For diehard Modesitt fans only -- and they'll want to skim.<br /><br />Modesitt's previous five SF outings -- Parafaith War, Ecolitan Enigma, Adiamante, Of Tangible Ghosts & Ghosts of the Revelator (reviewed, and recommended, at site below) -- were all good to excellent, so I can forgive one clunker. If you haven't tried Modesitt's SF, don't start with Gravity Dreams!<br /><br />___________<br /><br />(1) -- one nice touch is a needleship named \\"Costigan\\".<br /><br />review copyright 1999 by Peter D.

Required reading for Macintosh users and people interested in the computer business (and/or strange entrepeneurs).<br /><br />  The basic Apple story -- Wozniak & Jobs in their Silicon Valley garage, Apple's meteoric rise, Job's tantrums & dismissal, Apple losing the market to IBM & Microsoft, falling to a near-bankrupt niche player;  then Job's return & Apple's resurrection -- is well-known to anyone with even a casual interest in the computer business. So why would anyone write -- or read -- a new book about Apple?<br /><br />  For the simple reason that Malone's written the best one yet. Lots of fresh details and anecdotes:  Jobs lied to his partner early, and stole $3000 due Wozniak. Jobs dated Joan Baez (note 1) after he became a millionaire. Jobs deserted his first child, and resisted paying child support for years. Jobs' legendary visit to Xerox PARC, & then borrowing their graphic interface for the Mac -- didn't happen that way. Apple was already far along on the Mac GUI project, and Jef Raskin should get the credit for inventing the Mac interface. Jobs first tried to kill the Mac project -- he championed the ill-fated Lisa (named after his abandoned daughter). When the Lisa failed, he pushed Raskin aside, and claimed the credit for the Macintosh.<br /><br />  Steve Jobs clearly isn't a nice guy -- but Apple couldn't have succeeded without him, as Wozniak was hopeless at business and marketing. And Apple went off the rails after he got the boot -- John Scully, who Jobs hired away from Pepsi, proved sadly inept as a hi-tech CEO, as did his successors Spindler and Amelio. Whatever Jobs' faults, he's a master marketer and visionary.<br /><br />  So Apple drifted along, lacking anyone in charge with an instinct for the jugular -- someone like (for instance) Bill Gates, who tried at least twice to get control of the Mac OS. What a pity he didn't; millions would have been spared the horrors of early Windows versions, and I wouldn't be stuck with an increasingly less-useful Macintosh (sigh).<br /><br />  Malone argues that Apple's mixed success and failure reflects the founders' personalities -- true enough, I suppose, but what I find more interesting is Jobs and Wozniak as two more poster-children for \\"successful inventors and entrepeneurs who are really weird.\\" These people aren't usually well-balanced  -- think J. Paul Getty, Howard Hughes, Thomas Edison, Bill Gates -- ranging from mild eccentrics to monsters. Which doesn't take away from their accomplishments, but serves as cautionary tales for those who must deal with such personalities. The trick being, of course, to maximize their contributions and minimize the collateral damage. Easier said than done, especially once they graduate to multi-billionaire status...<br /><br />_____________<br /><br />(1)  well, she's just barely old enough to be his mother...<br /><br />review copyright 1999 by Peter D.

An entertaining and visionary look at<br />the future of humanity in a space-based economy.<br /><br />The idea of moving mining to space dates back at least to Russian space<br />visionary Konstantin Tsiolkovski (1903).  Robert Goddard's pioneering<br />rocketry experiments in the 1920's were paid for by the Guggenheim<br />foundation, with money from mining (Asarco).  Goddard himself<br />envisioned the migration of industry and people to space (1918).<br /><br />Mr. Lewis, Codirector of the Space Engineering Research Center at the<br />University of Arizona, brings these speculations up to date for the turn<br />of the 21st century.<br /><br />The resources available in the asteroid belt are truly staggering.  Lewis<br />estimates that there is enough iron there to cover the earth to a depth of<br />one-half mile(!).  At present-day  prices, this iron would be worth about<br />$7 billion for each person now alive.  Add in nickel, platinum, copper,<br />gold, uranium and so on, and the total exceeds $100 billion per person.<br />Makes the \\"Limits to Growth\\" folks look pretty silly.<br /><br />Of course, there are a *few* steps to be taken before these resources<br />become economic, not the least mustering the courage and imagination<br />to  take them.  Yogi Berra reminds us that \\"the trouble with predicting<br />the future is that it is very hard\\",  but from an engineering standpoint,<br />there's no reason why everyone can't become healthy, wealthy and very<br />numerous. Just can't do it all *here*...<br /><br />review copyright 1998 by Peter D. Tillman<br /><br />Consulting Geologist, Tucson & Santa Fe (USA)	2005-09-12

Really, it's just barely SF, and might better be termed a naval procedural -- and very nicely-done, too. In 2098, Ensign Paul Sinclair's first duty assignment is aboard the USS Michaelson CLE(S)-3, a long-endurance space cruiser, newly-deployed to patrol American-claimed space. Young Sinclair suffers through the agonies of on-the-job officer training -- trials that will bring a twinge of sympathy from anyone who's started out green in a demanding job with a difficult boss. Hemry's portrait of the trials and triumphs of day-to-day naval life rings true  to this former naval officer -- and I'm pleased that the Supply Officer, the humble 'porkchop', is one of the more sympathetic characters, since that was my job, too.<br /><br />On patrol, the Michaelson detects a South Asian Alliance ship trespassing on the American claim. Challenged, the rival vessel flees. The Michaelson orders the intruder to heave to for boarding. The intercept goes horribly wrong -- the American cruiser fires on the SASAL ship, killing all on board. The intruder turns out to be an unarmed research vessel.<br /><br />Captain Wakeman is called to account for his actions at a general court-martial, described as meticulously, and as grippingly, as any fictional courtroom drama I've read. Ens. Sinclair, who doubles as the ship's Legal Officer, feels compelled to testify in favor of his disgraced Captain, even though he thinks Wakeman was a piss-poor commanding officer....<br /><br />All of this is related in thoughtful, serviceable, workmanlike prose that clunks at times, but gets the job done. The job, in this case, is a sympathetic examination of how the modern US Navy actually works, with fallible people doing their duty, or dodging it, or bungling it...<br /><br />Naval SF novels tend to be Hornblower-knockoffs (Weber, Drake, Feintuch, etc.), so it's a pleasure to see one drawn from the 21st century instead of the 18th. The young Ensign's coming-of-age reminded me of Heinlein's classic Space Cadet, which was drawn from his 1930's Naval service.<br /><br />Hemry is a retired Naval officer who grew up as a Navy brat, so he's walked the walk, too. Hemry's space warships are, reasonably enough, extrapolated as subs/tin cans-in-space, with similarly compact and, um, challenging interior dimensions. About the only substantial change in Hemry's end-of-the-21st century US Navy is the complete integration of women into the service. This is reasonable, too, as the Navy is a *very* tradition-bound organization.<br /><br />This is the first and best of the four &#34;JAG in Space&#34; novels. I've read  #2 & #3, and my review of #2 is at the first comment. But, basically, read the first and stop, is my advice.<br /><br />Happy reading,<br />Peter D.

Hearing a rumor of a<br />secret alien colony, on impulse he sneaks into it and forges a new<br />identity, hoping the weird, smelly \\"humans\\" will inspire him, and<br />jump-start his stalled artistic career. Inspiration he gets, plus exotic<br />travel, but at a very high price....<br /><br />Cheelo Montoya is a ninloco, a small-time Tico hood on the lam<br />from a mugging that went sour. He's hiding out in the Peruvian<br />Reserva Amazonia, waiting for the heat to die down. He falls out of<br />his stolen boat, which chugs on out-of-sight, on autopilot. Now he's<br />hiding in a tree, after an unfortunate encounter with a column of<br />army ants, when this *giant bug* walks by....<br /><br />Des and Cheelo make a wary acquaintance, and then an uncertain<br />partnership against the hazards of the jungle: jaguars, anacondas,<br />poachers.... and unwittingly advance the budding Human-Thranx<br />alliance. But the wily reptilian AAnn have an idea of how to throw<br />a spanner in the works. Tune in next time for -- Book Two, Dirge!<br />(Should be out RSN -- it's been turned in to the publisher.)<br /><br />This is a very entertaining book -- light, fun, and action-packed, with<br />clever twists and likeable characters. A lot like the good old stuff we<br />read and loved when we were fourteen. And, for that matter, like<br />earlier ADF books I've liked -- I'd gotten out of the habit of reading<br />Foster, after several so-so books (and the appropriately-titled \\"The<br />Damned\\" trilogy), so I'm very pleased to see him back at the top of<br />his form. Familiarity with earlier Humanx Commonwealth books is<br />helpful but certainly not required -- and, unlike many such books, Phylogenesis comes to a satisfying closure. If you happen to be new to<br />Foster, or were disappointed before, this is a good chance to see him<br />at his best. Fluff, but *good* fluff.<br /><br />Review copyright 1999 by Peter D.

In essence, these are classic good vs. evil confrontations, with the moral vigor of the Morphodite and his allies contrasted with the evil and corruption of the Mask Factory and the Galactics who built it. But they'll get their comeuppance, in the oft-appalling vengeance of the Morphodite!<br /><br />This closely-linked series features marvelously Vancean writing, vivid characters and weird societies. Minor plot-logic lapses. And, I'm sorry to say, PRESERVER isn't as good as the first two, so you may want to stop at #2.<br /><br />Pluses: good sex and better characters. The major characters are remarkably well-drawn. And Foster had a real talent for sketching weird (but plausible) human societies. Plus he's a marvelous storyteller.<br /><br />Minus: humor. Almost none detectable.<br /><br />Morphodite & Transformer are two of the best SF novels of the 80's, I think, and if you've missed out on discovering Mike Foster, you have a number of treats in store. Sadly, his books never sold that well, and so he dropped out of writing SF over 20 years ago. A real pity.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br /><br />Pete Tillman	2005-09-08

I didn't much care for it, but that's a minority opinion, I think.<br /><br />Stellar Harvest, a new story in the \\"Lydia Duluth\\" series by Eleanor Arnason, is fast-paced and fun, a fine entry to her neat new series.<br /><br />Linda Nagata's Nebula-winning \\"Goddesses\\" is a profoundly hopeful near-future love-story -- that technology can improve poor peoples' lives, and enrich the rich helpers' lives in the process. Nagata writes with assurance and grace, touching on wealth & poverty, women & men, love, charity, religion and how we'll live a few years from now -- all without being preachy or dull. One of the year's best. Not to be missed. You can read the story online at scifi[dot]com.<br /><br />The wrapup story is Gardner Dozois' great \\"A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows\\",  my favorite Dozois story ever. Dozois writes, in the Nebula anthology intro, {quote} [This] is my take on two of the major areas of debate of science fiction in the 90's, the posthuman condition and the idea of living into a Vingean singularity...[end quote]<br /><br />\\"From the first heraldic image to the last, this is Dozois at his most<br />intense, personal, and skillful.\\" --Kim Stanley Robinson, in his introduction.<br /><br />All this plus the usual insightful commentary, by such luminaries as Gwyneth Jones, Andy Duncan, Damon Knight, Gene Wolfe, Ken MacLeod, and many more.

From recent<br />radiometric dating, it looks like all of the Deccan eruptions occurred<br />within a brief, 0.7 my  time-span. The biggest and most violent<br />eruptions apparently occurred within a few thousand years of the KT<br />boundary; individual flows of several thousand cubic kilometers of<br />basalt were not uncommon.<br /><br />Compare this to the largest historic 'flood'-basalt eruption: Laki in<br />Iceland produced 12 cu. km of lava in 1783-84. The SO2 and other gases<br />that Laki released, destroyed most of the island's crops and forage.<br />Then 50-80% of the island's livestock, and about 1/4 of the Icelandic<br />people, starved to death.  Laki lowered global temperatures by about<br />1 deg. C (from fine-particle ash & sulfur aerosols).<br /><br />Extrapolating to a 5,000 cu. km flood-basalt eruption, the average<br />global temperature might decrease by around 7 deg. C (13 deg. F). The<br />volcanic HCl emissions could destroy most of the ozone layer [note 2],<br />dramatically increasing UV at the surface, and injuring or killing<br />many organisms. The familiar volcanogenic \\"toxics\\" -- F, As, Sb, Hg, Se<br />etc. -- would poison nearby life. And the volcanic SO2 & HCl would<br />cause severe acid-rain damage as they were washed out of the<br />atmosphere. Then, repeat this disaster with the next big eruption, over<br />& over again, a dozen or more times in the next 10,000 years or so. The<br />total 'kill factor' would very likely be greater than that from the<br />Chicxulub impact, albeit spread out over tens or hundreds of<br />thousands of years. And a more gradual die-off is (usually) a better<br />fit to the known fossil record.<br /><br />So it turns out that the volcanists and the meteor-strike proponents<br />were *both* right, at least for the KT mass-extinction. The<br />combination of the Chicxulub strike with the Deccan mega-eruption<br />turned an 'ordinary' mass-extinction into the second-worst ever.<br />And thoroughly muddied the scientific waters while this was being<br />worked out. Once again, reality trumps fiction -- Nemesis atop Shiva!<br /><br />But, for the 10 or so \\"big\\" mass-extinctions known [note 3], *seven*<br />are of the same age as major flood-basalt eruptions, vs. one or two<br />with major same-age impacts. And those two meteor-strikes coincide<br />with massive flood-basalt eruptions -- *no* major mass-extinctions<br />appear to be solely impact-caused. So it's fair to say that flood-basalts<br />are more deadly to Earthly life than meteor-strikes. And a hazard not<br />amenable to any engineering solution that I know of -- except being<br />ready to move off the planet, when the next new hot-spot head nears<br />breakout. Which will come, sure as death [note 4]. An unpleasant<br />reminder of our fragility.<br /><br />Mea culpa: I'd pretty much taken the \\"KT impact killed off the dinos\\"<br />theory as proven -- I didn't even bother to read the last volcanist<br />counter-argument I saw. As Courtillot notes, I'm hardly the only one<br />to do so. Hey, those guys are the old fuddy-duddies, right?  The<br />'stamp-collectors', Luis Alvarez called them. Hence this review, a<br />'heads-up' to others, and an expiation for me.<br /><br />_Evolutionary Catastrophes_ is clearly written and is (mostly)<br />accessible to the general reader [note 5]. This is the latest chapter in the<br />gradualist vs. catastrophist dialog that is as old as geologic science.<br />Writing with great good humor, skepticism, and a love for a scientific<br />tale well-told, Courtillot goes a long way towards redressing the<br />balance in the hottest earth-science argument at the turn of the 21st<br />century. Highly recommended.<br /><br />_______________<br /><br />Note 1) Courtillot relates a cute story of the serendipities of field work:<br />a paleontology student had worked for years in one of these basins,<br />with little sucess.

Historic basalt eruptions haven't done so, but we're<br />talking eruptions 500 times larger than any ever seen....<br /><br />3) Various authors propose from 5 to about 20 \\"major\\" mass-<br />extinction events.

McAuley's &#34;Gardens of Saturn&#34;<br />(1998, Interzone), set in his excellent &#34;Quiet War&#34; series. Two<br />veterans of the winning side, both stranded in the Saturn system at<br />war's end, meet by chance years later on Phoebe. Ex-Colonel Vera<br />Jackson is desperate to escape her job as nursemaid (and worse) to a<br />fat, rich drunk. She draws Baker, an old comrade, into a complicated<br />extortion scheme aimed at the drunk's mother, a wealthy recluse.<br />The scheme goes awry, in a classic tale of the &#34;biter bit&#34;, with a<br />deliciously nasty sting in its tail.

The protag is one Travis Bismarck, who appears to be a real-life friend of Barnes. The book opens with (literally) loopy scene-setting that circles around the actual start in amusingly recursive spirals, as Barnes old pal ficto-Travis, who is some sort of technical PI, relates his current case, and how it went weird.<br /><br />Now, I'm assuming that Barnes's Real Life isn't too different (in its non-fantastic day-to-day details) than the fictional JB -- the broad outlines match, it isn't a very flattering portrait, and it's just easier to write what you know. I was pretty consistently entertained by Barnes \\"what is reality?\\" mind-games, but you might not be:<br /><br />\\"I found that every now and then I'd be pulled out of the book by the character of John Barnes talking about being a science fiction writer. I couldn't help but wonder if he really thinks about SF conventions like that, or the fans, or the genre. Every time I came upon some Barnes POV stuff I'd get jerked out of the story. At times, reading the book was like peeking into someone's diary and wondering, would I get caught.\\" -- Gayle Surrette, Google sfrevu.com<br /><br />\\"Barnes has done a bang-up job creating a rich air of verisimilitude and a thickness of believable details. His self-portrait is unsparing and modest, even self-abasing, and the humility and skepticism of the narrator allow us easy entrance into the wacky doings described by Travis. Generous dollops of humor and satire-Barnes and Travis have a lot of wry opinions about academia, entertainment and other demented aspects of our culture-grease the telling as well.\\" -- Paul Di Filippo at scifi.com, the best review I saw online.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're in the mood for a cozy, clever, twisty, sexy, crackpot, meandering, recursive, wonderfully implausible piece of metafiction that's full of wisecracks and is just a whole lot of fun to read (plus, it's short!), go for GAUDEAMUS. A fine, semi-mindless read for a mental winter vacation. Caveat: if plot holes and logic-lapses offend you, Gaudeamus might not be for you.

Barnes light	______________________________________________<br /><br />Lyle Peripart is reasonably content with his quiet life as an expatriate American academic in New Zealand, a pleasant backwater in a world ruled by the Twelve Reichs. Until he accepts a plum job offer from a billionaire industrialist -- and he's roughed up by the Gestapo in Surabaya, shot at in Saigon, and comes home to a smoking crater where his house used to be. Then things get *really* weird...<br /><br />Experienced SF readers will have little doubt as to what's happening -- the Many Worlds hypothesis has been a fertile SF breeding-ground for quite some time -- but, as always, the genius is in the details. In Finity we get such goodies as robot taxicabs with easily-hurt feelings, private suborbital jump-boats (but no automobiles) for the middle-class, and a neat new quantum-computing rationale for Many Worlds slippage. Not to mention -- finally! -- an explanation for all those 1 or 2-ring phantom phone calls I get.<br /><br />What we *don't* get is a particularly consistent or well-thought-out<br />plot or backstory [note 1]. I didn't have any problems suspending disbelief while reading Finity -- a matter of 3 or 4 hours -- but if you're a critical reader, this one may not be for you. But if you're looking for a light, fast, read-once entertainment -- as I was -- Finity will fill the bill nicely.<br /><br />Barnes dedicates Finity to a reader who asked, \\"Just once, would it kill you to write an adventure story, with a reasonably happy ending, and only a *little* weird?\\"<br /><br />_________________________<br /><br />Note 1.) There's a bunch of Finity-gripes here. I don't recommend reading them just before you read the book, as *SPOILERS* abound. It is worth looking up Gerald Jonas' (spoiler-free)review at the NY Times (google); he liked it, too.<br /><br />review copyright 2000 by Peter D. Tillman	2005-09-07

This will be an unusually disorganized \\"review\\", since I took some notes, browsed around online (finding nothing worthwhile), then witlessly returned the book before writing it up. So you'll be getting what was truly memorable...<br /><br />Anyway, this is a sequel to Tea from an Empty Cup (which I haven't read), and is further hijinx in VR (here AR), which to my great relief doesn't include the (to me) odious Post-apocalyptic Noo Yawk Sitty (sic, and sicker). This one involves one Hastings Dervish, who is stalking his ex in cyberspace, and running Lt. Konstantin of the AR Police around in circles in the bowels of the casinos of digital Hong Kong. It's an sfnal police procedural, and a nice one.<br /><br />Very crisp writing. Lots of lovely one-line zingers -- I'd quote you some, if I still had the book...  \\"He morphs, he torques, he crawls on his belly like a reptile...\\" -- his ex, re the elusive Dervish, from a scribbled note to myself.<br /><br />The ending is one of those where the book just stops, which actually works pretty well here. And the book is blessedly short. Recommended.<br /><br />Incidentally, my fave Cadigan of all time is the wonderfully creepy short, \\"Roadside Rescue\\". Wham, bam, SLAM. Reprinted often, and worth looking for.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br /><br />Pete Tillman	2005-09-07

He doesn't quite have the Master's grace, but updates the flavor of these fondly-remembered books nicely. Duke is up-to-date, brisk, clever, sexy and fun.<br /><br />Barnes constructs his backstory with some care -- he's used it in three Jak Jinnaka novels so far, with more planned. By the thirty-sixth century, humankind has spread throughout the solar system. We survived an attempted genocide by the alien, retaliated by sterilizing their homeworld, and have settled into an uneasy coexistence with refugees occupying the Pluto and beyond.<br /><br />Even in the 36th century, when &#34;Duke&#34; is set, fusion power has never been developed, so the Outer System still runs on fission, a rather charmingly retro touch.<br /><br />The battered Earth has recovered, and shares power with two huge orbital stations at L4 and L5 -- the unified Hive, and the balkanized Aerie. The inner system runs on solar power, and the outer on good, old-fashioned uranium reactors (hence the title).. Interworld transport is by large light-sail liners....<br /><br />As expected, the novel ends happily and with a moral: video games are a fine training-ground for apprentice heroes!<br /><br />The Duke is the most fun I've had between book covers in awhile. Barnes has written a fast-moving book, and if some of the plotting doesn't stand up to close inspection, you won't care. Recommended for hours of frivolous relaxation.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D. Tillman	2005-09-07

Highly recommended	______________________________________________<br /><br />It would be hard to over-praise AADB, my favorite of Banks' novels. Instead, here is a fair sample [no spoilers]:<br /><br />  Zefla Franck, once described as nearly two meters of utter<br /><br />voluptuousness with a brain, strolled along the lane, ...her long<br /><br />golden hair undone and straggling to the waist of her slinky dress,<br /><br />her shoes off and held over one shoulder....  The night was warm.<br /><br />The faint breeze rising from the orchards in the valley below<br /><br />smelled sweet.<br /><br />  She whistled and watched the sparkling sky, where Maidservant --<br /><br />Golter's second moon -- shone blue-gray and bounteous near the<br /><br />horizon -- a great stone-and-silver ship escorted and surrounded by<br /><br />a school of flickering, glittering lights: habitats and factories,<br /><br />satellites and mirrors.... It was, Zefla thought, really quite beautiful...<br /><br />Moonlight and junklight. Junklight. Such a callous, mean-spirited<br /><br />name for something so beautiful....<br /><br />  She watched a winking satellite move with a perfect, steady<br /><br />stateliness across the vault....  She [put] her head down to make sure<br /><br />she wouldn't trip.<br /><br />  She hiccuped suddenly. \\"Sh*t!\\" she said.<br /><br />  Maybe it was looking downward that did it. She looked back up at<br /><br />the sky and hiccuped again. \\"Sh*t sh*t sh*t!\\"<br /><br />  ... She was nearly home, and she hated going into the house with<br /><br />the hiccups; Dloan always made fun of her.<br /><br />  Another hiccup. She growled and fixed all her attention on the<br /><br />satellite. Her shin hit something hard. \\"Aow, f*ck!\\"<br /><br />  Zefla hopped around on one foot, clutching her shin. \\"Ow ow ow!\\"<br /><br />she said. She glared at what she'd bumped into: ... a huge pale car,<br /><br />almost filling the lane outside the house.

Here a naval task force from 2021 is diverted to 1942 by a DARPA teleportation experiment gone spectacularly wrong. In the confusion, the moderns sink most of Admiral Spruance's fleet, enroute to Midway. Oops....<br /><br />This is a first-rate piece of AH/mil-SF, marred by being #1 of 3, pacing problems, and some odd auctorial choices.  His 2021 is a rather grim place. The interactions of 2021 with 1942 are very nicely done.<br /><br />Huge logical flaw in the denouement of vol. 1, which needs a *SPOILER WARNING*, and which wasn't immediately obvious, to me anyway (but I'm slow, and sick):<br /><br />[Islamic jihadists hijack an 'old' 21st- C. frigate, try to ram the supercarrier. Which finds its guns won't depress far enough to blow same out of the water]  After 20+ years of fighting suicide jihadis, the Navy hasn't figured out an effective close-range defense??? Worse, they have one ('MetalStorm'), but Birmingham ignores it to make a cute plot-twist: the &#34;Hillary Clinton&#34; is saved by a 1942 fighter! Bad, bad author! What was he thinking? That his readers are stupid? Editor asleep at the screen?<br /><br />Nevertheless, I recommend WoC to mil-SF and alt-hist fans, as the best of same I've seen yet this year.<br /><br />Paul Di Filippo's enthusiastic review led me to read it. He gives WoC a solid &#34;A&#34;  [G00GLE scifi[dot]com] Sample:<br />Perhaps Birmingham's biggest accomplishment is the clash of civilizations he brilliantly limns. I'm not talking about Muslim fanatics of 2021 versus the rest of the world, but rather the culture of 2021 versus that of 1942...<br /><br />UPDATE 02/24/16: I tarted to reread this, but got lost in the minutae of refighting WW2.

Pure teenage-boybait (and why I've kept the book for 40 years). Artist (uncredited in the Bantam ed.) was Mitchell Hooks. You won't be surprised to learn that the cover art (and blurbs) are almost pure tease. Nothing in the contents would have shocked Kay Tarrant, John W. Campbell's Mrs. Grundy.<br /><br />I was surprised how much info there is on the net on this obscure old pb. It even makes author Lawrence Watt-Evans's Golden Oldie list [google]:<br />\\"The lani are discovered on a distant planet in the far future; they look human, save that they have tails. A lani with her tail removed is indistinguishable from human.<br /><br />The law says, however, that the key is interfertility; anything that humans can breed with is human, and anything they can't breed with is just an animal. The lani, therefore, are animals, and the story follows the adventures of the young veterinarian hired to tend a lani herd as he gradually discovers the history and true nature of the species. It's got adventure, romance, excitement, and a dose of thought-provoking questions as well. Worth reading, definitely.\\"<br /><br />The setup is 1950's standard-SF: the Brotherhood of Man loosely governs the 6,000 human-settled worlds, which are linked by hyperspace (spindizzy) FTL spaceships and Dirac communicators. Humans have been in space for 5,000 years, but their culture is (surprise!) *just like* the USA in 1960....<br /><br />Note that Bone's moral-philosophy lectures are pretty damn tedious. And you are likely to question whether a 4,000 year-old abandoned spaceship could really be fixed up (in secret, on nights and weekends) by the vet and his girlfriend....<br /><br />Anyway, it's all of 152 pp. long, so it would make a practical (and free! --google gutenberg.org) ebook.

I read it based on Paul di Filippo's fine review: [Google]<br /><br />Di Filippo's rapidly becoming my favorite SF reviewer, particularly for his scifi.com reviews. Note that this one does have a naked spoiler (which I'd fortunately forgotten by the time I read the book. A bad memory does have its virtues!).<br /><br />The premise is a clever nod to the Pohl & Kornbluth classic, _The Space Merchants_: with a big enough population, even a one-in-a-billion deviant-- well, there'd be six of 'em now. And the reverse-altruism genetic-sport idea is original, and horrific.<br /><br />The first-person protagonist here appears to be a lightly-fictionalized alter ego of the author. I liked how he (the protag) *doesn't* fall in love with the female lead, and they *don't* live happily ever after. The \\"Smelly\\" telepath is a tour-de-force of character-building. Maybe Robinson is finally growing up as a writer?<br /><br />The novel is set in British Columbia, Robinson's home, and features poetic descriptions of the gorgeous BC scenery. And amusing anecdotes (as always) of dealing with bureaucracy. The coffee maker! --which I can't find now, but is some $3000 gizmo that starts with beans at one end, and many buzzes, hisses, wheezes and gurgles later, emits a perfect cuppa at the other. Complete with make & model, if you need one for your self -- another feature of Spider's writing that I've always liked. I always liked his book-reviews, too. Really should look to see if his newspaper column is online. Ah, I see he has a book of collected columns out --there's a link on this page, which I can't put here due to Amazon's paranoia re URLs in reader reviews. Bah.<br /><br />I read the book in one sitting and thoroughly enjoyed it. Not without flaws, but very good. Recommended if you liked, eg, his LIFEHOUSE (1997).<br /><br />_____________________<br /><br />[1] OK, there are still a few horrible puns...

This is an impressive book. It's well-researched, and features complex people, muddling through life, in cultures much different than our own. The Gears' characters are exceptionally well-drawn.  They're presented sympathetically, but with warts and all. Besides history, there's romance, treachery, greed, slavery, rape, murder, humor, exotic religion, mystery.... and fine masonry. A great deal of fine masonry. Did I mention the murals? The masks? The macaws?<br /><br />The Chaco phenomenon has been puzzling and fascinating people since the rediscovery of the Chaco Canyon ruins in the 19th century. I've followed the debate with interest [note 1], and the Gears' story is as likely to be tru(ish) as any. Although I'm kinda partial to the  more recent \\"Mexican cannibal terrorist warlords\\" hypothesis [2] for Chaco's Secret Masters -- which isn't incompatible with (but is darker than) the Gears' interpretation. Both Gears are (IB) working archaeologists, and they've clearly spent some time around the campfire with the Chaco guys, listening to stories too outrageous to be published...<br /><br />And if you've never visited Chaco, well, you should.  Fall is the primo time. Bring a sturdy vehicle, and plan to camp out for a night or two. And don't miss Earl Morris's stunning recreation of the Great Kiva at Aztec Ruins -- which you'll recognize from the novel. There are no finer Precolumbian buildings in this country. And no finer masonry anywhere.<br /><br />SILENCE is a gripping and successful long novel, which held my attention throughout. This is the best novel of the prehistoric Southwest I've read (this is an uncrowded niche). An impressive achievement, and a definite keeper. Highly recommended for historical-fiction and Southwestern US fans.<br /><br />__________________<br /><br />Note 1) Fellow Chaco fans will enjoy catching up by reading \\"In Search of Chaco: New Approaches to an Archaeological Enigma\\" (2004), edited by David Grant Noble -- though he unaccountably left out the \\"Mexican cannibal terrorist warlords\\" theory.<br /><br />2) MCTW is largely the work of Prof. Christy Turner, as documented in his book \\"Man Corn\\" (1998). The cannibal part is well-supported -- Turner even found a fossil human turd in a burnt-out pueblo, above a mass-grave, in southern Colorado. On analysis, the coprolite had relict proteins found only in human muscle tissue.  Yup, burn out your enemies, eat them, sh*t on their graves. Yuck.<br /><br />So much for the \\"peaceful Anasazi\\" wishful-thinking, which still hangs on in a few romantic holdouts....

Don't miss!	__________________________________<br /><br />\\"In 1814, we took a little trip...\\" This old Johnny Horton tune was about all I remembered about the War of 1812. Oh, and the British burned the White House.... You may be certain that you'll know a good deal more about this chapter of American history after you've read Flint's latest. And be very well-entertained en route.<br /><br />Flint's aim in this first of a new series is to construct a plausible Native Nation on America's western frontier, from the Cherokees and the other four Civilized Tribes who were dumped into Indian Territory (now eastern Oklahoma) in the first half of the 19th century, with unhappy results in our timeline (though they're doing OK now). Flint makes it clear that, with the number of European immigrants pouring into the Southeast, the tribes were going to lose their land, one way or another. He's trying for a less-horrible eviction than the Trail of Tears. What if the Tribes moved 'voluntarily', with their cultures +/- intact, and developed a hybrid culture that would affect America for the good?<br /><br />I'll be following the progress of this what-might-have-been saga with great interest -- particularly since my Scotch-Irish ancestors helped make this history, and picked up a little Cherokee blood en route.<br /><br />I came away from _Rivers of War_ with a more three-dimensional mental portrait of Andrew Jackson, a major character here, and who I'd previously filed under \\"boorish rabble-rouser\\". He looks much better (or at least more complex) in Flint's portrayal. Most of his characters were historical figures (including Sam Houston, a protagonist), though Flint ceerfullyly admits to fleshing-out the less well-known ones to fit his story. His battle scenes are unflinching, and may be too graphic for some. But Flint seems to have an unususually good understanding of the principles of warfare. And you won't be surprised to learn that Flint was once a  candidate for a Ph. D. in history.<br /><br />Now, this is alternate history, but I don't think I'll spoil your fun by letting on that Flint has stuck pretty close to *real* history, so far anyway. And he's dished up an excellent historical novel here -- entertaining, informative, fast-moving, action-packed. *Lots* of blood & gore (fair warning). I read it in two sittings and liked it a lot. _Rivers of War_ is Flint's best novel to date -- he's gotten better in writing craft, characterization, depth of research -- heck, all the writerly virtues I can think of. Most importantly, he's a helluva storyteller. Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you would like further fictional exploration of Cherokee history, I strongly recommend Larry McMurtry's very fine _Zeke and Ned_, set in mid-19th century Oklahoma, after their forced resettlement. A crackerjack, underrated historical novel.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br /><br />Pete Tillman<br /><br />© 2005.

This slim novella, by the late and distinguished paleontologist, was<br />found in his papers after his death. It's just so-so as fiction, in my<br />opinion, but the book is worth your attention for the two elegant essays<br />included. The first, by Arthur C. Clarke, outlines the history of time-travel<br />stories,  and includes more recommendations for classic dinosaur tales.<br />Sir Arthur notes, with admirable succintness, that \\"the most convincing<br />argument against [real] time travel is the remarkable scarcity of [real]<br />time travellers.\\"<br /><br />Stephen Jay Gould was a student of Simpson's, and contributes a<br />graceful and elegaic essay on Simpson's novella, career and life --<br />which, I must say, I enjoyed more than the story. An exceptional<br />piece, not to be missed if you have any interest in Gould or Simpson.<br /><br />Simpson's novella does have its charms -- it has a nice mock-<br />Victorian club-story opening, not unlike Clarke's Tales from the<br />White Hart, and is oddly compelling despite the amateurish writing.<br />Sam Magruder, a chronologist in 2162, is accidentally \\"dechronized\\"<br />into the late Cretaceous,  with no possibility of rescue, and spends the<br />rest of his life evading, eating and studying dinosaurs. It's certainly<br />not \\"the best time travel story since HG Wells\\" as the cover blurb<br />avers, but it's  worth a look. Sadly, the story's paleontology is<br />now quite out of date.<br /><br />Peter D.

Just about every half-remembered nursery-rhyme character makes an appearance: The Three Little Pigs, Rumplestilkin, clues such as an auburn, 28-foot long human hair -- along with more about podiatry than you really want to know. What are verrucas, anyway?<br /><br />Anyway, all the exuberant, clever British silliness that I love in Jasper Fforde is here.

After the death of 97% of humanity, civilization more-or-less collapses, of an acute shortage of repairmen -- and all the other non-rich folk who kept the machinery running.<br /><br />The story itself takes place aboard humanity's first starship, launched almost a century after the War. The protagonist operates the ship's \\"time machine\\", an elaborate virtuality for exploring history. The machine turns out to have unexpected emergent qualities, which won't surprise the experienced reader.<br /><br />I'm ambivalent about this one. It's beautifully-written, and far superior to Camouflage, his last. There's some really cool stuff here, especially the emergent AI's strange personality. The ending will forcefully remind you of a classic no-no for beginning writers -- though, in fairness, it is a logical outcome, given the setup. But unsatisfying, dammit. Second-rank Haldeman -- which means it's still pretty darned good: \\"B+\\"<br /><br />Regular Haldeman readers will note his repeated use of historical recreations, Vietnam flashbacks, immortality, graphic violence, and steamy sex.

The Harlequin system is typical of recent extrasolar-planet discoveries -- a huge gas-giant has 'eaten' all the inner system as it spiralled in towards its sun, leaving no planets in the life-zone. The crew of the \\"John Glenn\\" need to refuel their ship, and need a place to build an antimatter factory, and a workforce to staff it. So they mash a buncha little moons together to build Selene, Harlequin's moon, as the novel opens, setting up the conflict between the demigod Earthborn and their Moonborn servants. Who are also their *children*, an unconvincing detail in the ensuing dustups  -- where are the protective parents when the High Council gets high-handed?<br /><br />OK, some of them were refrozen, in the starship's corpsicle capsules, but this trampling on basic human nature is slipped by quickly, in hopes we won't notice....<br /><br />The Earthly backstory -- AI revolts! and a gray-goo nano meltdown -- is generic, and not too convincing. And, clearly the \\"John Glenn\\" didn't really need to build such an elaborate habitat. I mean, terraform a moon-mash? [1] C'mon. Why not inflate an asteroid, or build an SF-standard O'Neill habitat? Not to mention the Council's REALLY STUPID IDEA of where to build their antimatter factory. But that would have made a more-generic novel, so let's let it slide....<br /><br />Anyway, I had fun reading Harlequin's. The book recaptures some of the joie de vivre of the classic Niven stories we all know and love. It's definitely a first novel, but an unusually good one. Recommended for old-fashioned space-adventure fans.<br /><br />The writing here is basically by Cooper, but there are enough Niven touches that it's clear he was substantially involved. They've previously collaborated on short fiction, notably the taut thriller \\"Ice and Mirrors\\". She's a writer to watch.<br /><br />[1] This qualifies as a genuinely Neat Idea, but shoehorning it into the story is a glaring first-novel rough spot.

Stalin's career total was at least 20 million people killed -- the vast majority Soviet citizens. For his revised edition of _The Great Terror_ some years ago, Conquest suggested that his publisher retitle it \\"I Told You So, You F*cking Fools\\".<br /><br />I've never quite gotten up the courage to read _The Great Terror_, and in fact I repeatedly bogged down in Amis's \\"short course\\" on Stalin's monstrous career. This sort of thing is almost too awful to contemplate. So people make excuses, or just don't believe, or put off thinking about it. Amis notes how convenient it was for Stalin that \\" a true description of the Soviet Union *exactly* resembled a demented slander of the Soviet Union.\\" Negative perfection.<br /><br />Yet contemplate monsters we must, or suffer them again. Stalin was hardly an isolated figure. The 21st century has monsters, too.<br /><br />--------<br /><br />In 1937, the Soviet Census officials reported the USSR's population as some millions of people less than Stalin expected (because of his Great Terror). Stalin promptly had the Census Board shot, and the 1939 Census duly reported a much larger population. Stalin then added another 3 million to this number for the \\"official\\" census report.<br /><br />Lee Harris, in his recent and thought-provokoing _Civilization and Its Enemies_ , spends considerable time discussing the invention and use of \\"fantasy ideologies\\" by the great political monsters of the twentieth century.

An ex-Marine commando, now an advertising consultant(!), gets caught up in a web of political intrigue when he accepts a seemingly-innocuous consulting assignment. In what is (in retrospect) a weak, ad-hoc auctorial plot-pusher, the ruthless Secret Masters of Earth and Mars decide to make a patsy of ex-Col. Dr. Jonat deVrai, then murder him. DeVrai turns out, unsurprisingly, to be both hard to kill and good at turning the tables on his attackers. Besides having a curiously apposite surname.... &#60;G&#62;<br /><br />This is all pretty basic, plot-boiling stuff, but Modesitt makes the book more intriguing by going deeply into his protagonist's life, and makes 25th century ad-consulting sound pretty interesting. Really. Plus there's a heavy dose of quotidien details that I (mostly) liked, setting up some startlingly-effective juxtapositions. On an 'interesting' day, deVrai's 'To Do' list might read:<br /><br />1) Get the kids fed and off to school.<br />2) Make sure Charis practices piano for an hour.<br />...<br />7) Blow up Mahmed Kemal, a local ganglord.<br /><br />What's a good guy to do if the system won't stop the bad guys?  &#34;Get them before they get you.&#34;<br /><br />DeVrai also gets involved with an unusual police AI and its attractive cydroid remote, Paula Athene(!), in a clear setup for a sequel or two. Jonat de Vrai's not quite up to Johan Eschbach, the very resourceful environmental-economist protagonist in Modesitt's excellent &#34;Tangible Ghosts&#34; trilogy, but he's cut from similar cloth.

"B-"	_____________________________________________<br /><br />McArthur's third novel is a near-future police-procedural whodunnit set in Japan. The Japanese setting is the most interesting part of the novel, I thought -- the author lived there for 16 years, returning to Australia in 1996. The protagonist, a female gaijin robotics scientist working in industrial R&D, is well-drawn and sympathetic. And the book is smoothly-written. Do you see the upcoming \\"but\\"?<br /><br />The sfnal McGuffin, a high-tech cult called the Silver Angels -- their leader, Adam, wants to rule Japan (today Japan -- tomorrow the world!) -- didn't work nearly as well, imo. The cultists' bafflegab computer-tech is confusing and unconvincing. The cult's leaders/bad guys are, well, central-casting cardboard. Well-researched cardboard, mind, but novelistically unconvincing. And their Eevil Deeds are all too obviously tailored to the story.<br /><br />Plus, it's bloody startling to hear tough Osaka cops speaking in Australian, mates....<br /><br />Still, a decent novel, which might be of particular interest to Japanophiles. \\"B-\\" for me -- I preferred her first novel, TIME FUTURE (2001).<br /><br />Happy reading--<br /><br />Pete Tillman<br /><br />Google Groups for my review of Time Future	2005-02-16

His first story was published more than 60 years ago. The Gateway sequence itself is now nearly 30 years old. Despite-or perhaps because of-all this history, Pohl's new book remains a feast and a pleasure.<br /><br />\\"Boy Who\\" is in part a fixup -- you are most likely to have already seen \\"Hatching the Phoenix\\" (1999), in which Gelle-Klara Moynlin pays for a scentific expedition to study the Crab Nebula supernova. The blast also incinerated the planet of the \\"Crabbers\\", a decidedly unsympathetic race of aliens. It's a crackerjack story, reprinted in the Dozois Year's Best --though its connection to the rest of the novel is tenuous. Two other previously-published stories are more smoothly integrated.<br /><br />So the novel reads a bit choppily -- but there's lots of cool Pohl stuff here. My favorite character is Marc Antony, the Stovemind AI. His primary duty is cooking up gourmet meals for humans and Heechees, both organic and machine-stored -- but his collatereal duty is Human-Heechee Security, and who Saves the Day! from the nefarious star-smashing plot that's the McGuffin here, and is a decidedly less-interesting part of the book.<br /><br />Ol' Fred isn't getting any younger, so I'm very pleased to recommend his latest novel.

The book combines Sterling's<br />wildman inventiveness with Gibson's brooding, streetwise<br />characters, both shoved back one and a half centuries into an<br />obsessively-detailed and weirdly-transmogrified London of 1855.<br /><br />Gibson & Sterling explore such topics as dinosaur physiology,<br />Catastrophism vs. Uniformitarian geology, chaos theory, Victorian<br />sexual practices, the Red Manhattan commune, treachery & graft in<br />the Republic of Texas, British Imperial realpolitik, pre-industrial<br />Japanese robotics, and mechanical-video technology. \\"Splendidly<br />extraordinary.... It is stimulating to have one's intelligence<br />overestimated by such brilliant writers.\\" -- the Times of London.<br /><br />The Difference Engine is less a novel than a series of interconnected<br />stories & vignettes -- a combination that worked well for me, but has<br />irritated others . The book reads more like \\"real\\"<br />history than fiction -- loose ends abound, mysteries are unresolved,<br />and characters disappear, just as in real life. If you like tidy, linear,<br />tightly-plotted novels, The Difference Engine may not be for you.<br />But --<br /><br />  Those willing to grant two master writers a large dollop of poetic<br />  license will enjoy the hauntingly strange landscape, filled with<br />  steam-propelled cars, 19th-century credit cards, and \\"clackers\\" -- the<br />  computer hackers of the day ...  [The] depth of imagining is<br />  magnificent ...  it's an immersion in a fascinating, wholly realized<br />  milieu.<br /><br />-- from Robert J. Sawyer's review (Google), which is the only one I found on<br />the net that I can recommend  ( CAUTION: SPOILERS ).<br /><br />Almost every character in the book was a real person, or is borrowed<br />from a period novel (by Disraeli, himself a character, a nice self-<br />referential touch). The depth of research into Victoriana is awesome<br />and a bit daunting. Fortunately, the estimable Eileen Gunn (\\"Stable<br />Strategies for Middle Management\\") has provided the \\"Difference<br />Dictionary\\" [Google sff.net], an essential<br />and spoiler-free reference, which you should have at hand when<br />reading the book (it was included in the Japanese edition).<br /><br />In a \\"real\\" alternate world, I'm not sure if history would have been<br />greatly affected had Babbage succeeded  -- his machine would have<br />been thousands of times slower than even the first vacuum-tube<br />computers (which were themselves cumbersome beasts -- ENIAC<br />(1946) weighed 30 tons). And marginally-reliable at best -- Babbage<br />failed partly because his Difference Engine required technology<br />beyond the capabilities of the time. In any case, the mid-nineteenth<br />century may not have been ripe for an Information Revolution --<br />it probably wasn't yet \\"steam-engine time\\". But I haven't done the<br />research that Sterling & Gibson did -- Sterling in particular is an<br />expert on 19th-century technology -- and their premise is certainly<br />plausible enough for fiction. And the story is more than strong<br />enough to overcome such niggling.<br /><br />I read The Difference Engine when it was first published, liked it,<br />and just finished rereading it, with at least as much pleasure as on<br />first reading. It's an oddly compelling book -- clearly not to<br />everyone's taste, but The Difference Engine suited, and entertained<br />me.

The culture shock from their visit to backward Rochard's World might be a bit overdone, but the shower of free cellphones that announced their visit turns out to be a nice foreshadowing of the Festival's Secret...<br /><br />I really liked both Rachel Mansour and Martin Springfield, the dual stars and [minor SPOILER] . . . . lovers of the book. Stross does a really nice job of sketching the personalities of these two fundamentally-decent people, stuck in a Really Dumb world, as they cope and fall in love. It's a pretty believable portrait of post-Singularity people, I thought. A well-done evocation of oldfolks with Full Medical, acting young. Springfield is a classic sfnal Engineer as Reluctant Hero, and Mansour a fine Toughgrrl-in-Black secret agent. Nice.<br /><br />Stross doesn't f*ck around in the backstory, and he's done his homework. FTL travel = time travel = the death of history, barring a very tough Time Cop. Here it's the Eschaton, the transcended AI who is very, very protective of the historical thread that brought it into existence. And carries a *very* big stick.<br /><br />The plot is a nice reprise of countless 50s/60s \\"Earthman's Burden\\" stories, nicely done, and certainly topical for 2004. Stross does set the threshold for regime change somewhat lower than did GW Bush....<br /><br />Cool throwaway: the Marxist-Gilderist Manifesto! (p. 133, US ed.)

The \\"Wintel\\"<br />success story is well known.  More harrowing was Intel's earlier self-<br />transformation from making memory chips to making microprocessors.<br /><br />How to steer an enterprise thru a major change in its business, per<br />Mr. Grove:<br /><br />1)  Figure out if a major change is imminent.  If so, you're about to<br />enter what Grove calls \\"the valley of death\\".<br /><br />2)  Figure out how to deal with it.  Largely (for CEOs), this involves<br />listening to your employees & doing your homework.<br /><br />3)  Set a new course, sell it to your company, and stick to it.<br /><br />The \\"secret\\" to success here is identifying the oncoming crisis early &<br />reacting sensibly.  He relates the story of Apple, a company with clearly<br />superior products - the Mac operating system, the first good laser<br />printer - completely missing the shift from proprietary to open<br />PC standards, and ending up as a niche player.  John Sculley, then<br />Apple's CEO, acknowledged this crucial mistake years later.  Groves<br />thinks Sculley knew this shift was happening , but wasn't able to<br />overcome Apple's \\"inertia of success\\".  Curiously, this was pretty<br />much the same problem IBM had when PCs began displacing<br />mainframes.  It's very hard for an organization to give up a strategy<br />that has been richly rewarded in the past.<br /><br />In management, as in engineering, we often learn more from failures<br />than successes.  Grove's case histories will make informative reading<br />for anyone in business.

What are you going to   do with that - write science fiction?\\"  \\"YES.\\"    Actually, I'd like to see Denton combine his technical background and   his wonderfully quirky characters in a REAL sf book .  .

Mr. Styron recovered (unlike Vincent van Gogh, Sylvia Plath, and millions of others) and recounts the course of his illness in this short book.<br /><br /> Mr. Styron's account will be familiar to other victims of depression (\\"unipolar disorder\\" in current medspeak) - the denial that one really has a problem, the self-loathing, the disheartening difficulty in getting competent professional help, the agonizing wait to see if this drug is going to work, the patronizing and/or thinly-veiled contempt of family and friends -- all will be sorely familiar.  This is the best literary account of depression that I have read.<br /><br /> I'm not sure how the book will read to the non-afflicted.  My wife liked it, and remarked on similarities when I was at my worst.  Some previous reviews, such as Andrew Ferguson's in the Wall Street Journal , border on the vicious:<br /><br /> [Mr. Styron's disease] moved him to pen this infinitely detailed inventory of his emotions, sell it to a large publishing house, ... and preen for hack photographers from People magazine...  [Mr. Styron] would prefer to wallow in his self-esteem deficiencies and write books that earn hundreds of thousands of dollars.  There's just no pleasing some people.<br /><br /> This remarkable review seems akin to mocking a recovered cancer or heart-attack victim for surviving and then having the temerity to talk about it.<br /><br />Highly recommended for depressives, their families and loved ones.<br /><br />Review copyright © 1991 Peter D.

"C-"	______________________________________________<br />I'm usually a pretty big McDevitt fan, but this one left me cold, and annoyed. I finished it, but barely, and only by skimming the dull parts. A \\"C-\\" book, disappointing.<br /><br />POLARIS is a locked-room mystery (in this case, a locked spaceship), marred by long dull stretches, stupid-character gimmicks, a really stupid denouement, and an astonishingly clumsy twist ending (which is sequel-ready). What's there to like? This is a 15 year-later followup to _A Talent for War_, which I recall as being quite good.<br /><br />POLARIS has gotten some pretty good notices, such as Ernest Lilley's review at sfrevu.com (Google). It does have a good opening scene, and has flashes of Good McDevitt (space archaeology, cool gadgets). But, overall, it's the weakest McDevitt I've read. Avoid if you're lukewarm on McDevitt, and start with hesitation and low expectations if you're a fan.<br /><br />If you've never tried McDevitt, I'd start with INFINITY BEACH ,<br />or the first Priscilla Hutchins book, ENGINES of GOD.<br /><br />Just don't let POLARIS be your first McDevitt experience!<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Pete Tillman<br />Google \\"Peter D.

A *very* odd bunch of English aristos visit the American west in the 1830's and have adventures.

And doesn't let real history get in the way of a good story &lt;g>.<br /><br />The past is a foreign country, and McMurtry's treatment of 1830's American history is strange enough to be sfnal.... Anyway, I had a great time reading the Berrybenders. Second only to _Lonesome Dove/Streets of Laredo_ among his historicals, I think, though not much like those.

Fortunately, they're all worthwhile, and some are brilliant -- such as the title story, \\"Stable Strategies for Middle Management\\" (1988, Hugo nominee), a novel view of the role of bioengineering in future corporate life, guaranteed to bring a smile. Then there's \\"Green Fire\\", cowritten with Michael Swanwick, Andy Duncan, and Pat Murphy, which is just terrific: a WW2 pulp burlesque, starring Isaac Asimov and Bob Heinlein, and featuring Tesla superscience, topless pirates, giant plesiosaurs, a kraken -- and a special guest appearance by Lord Quetzalcoatl! Great stuff. SF's best-ever 4-author story!<br /><br />Her third \\"A\\" story, \\"Nirvana High\\" (with Leslie What), makes its first appearance here. The special-ed students at Cobain High have, well, *special* talents, and Gunn's sfnal look at high-school life ranks right up there with Suzy McKee Charnas' \\"B00BS\\" and Sharon Farber's \\"The Nostalginauts\\" . Top-notch story.<br /><br />\\"Computer Friendly\\", a 1990 Hugo nominee, features 9-yr old Elizabeth \\"Lizardbreath\\", and how she saved her friends online and learned to spit. Cool, nerdy stuff, if a bit dated now.<br /><br />And her first sale, \\"What Are Friends For?\\" (1978) is still a crackerjack -- I'd never seen it, and I'll bet you'll like it, too. Gunn notes that her check for $51.63, from Ted White's AMAZING, \\"came in someone else's SASE, with their name crossed out and mine scrawled in... I had hit the big time.\\"<br /><br />And there's more! Bottom line: 11 stories, 5 \\"A\\"s, 6 \\"B\\"s -- plus an \\"ideologically labile\\" recipe, and cool little Gunnophile goodies from Gibson, Swanwick, and Waldrop. \\"Open [the book] and be dazzled! -- JP Kelly's blurb, with a coverful of other nice blurbs, from Le Guin, Doctorow, Willis, and many more.<br /><br />So, you owe it to yourself to check out Eileen Gunn's neat stories. As Michael Swanwick sings,<br /><br />\\"Hooray for Eileen and her bully machine...<br />She's graced with a runcible style...<br />Lets all celebrate<br />Before it's too late...<br />Eileen! -- and her bully machine.\\"<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Pete Tillmansings,     \\"Hooray for Eileen and her bully machine...

OK, a big, fat crackerjack historical novel about 11th century Britain, specifically on the life of the (maybe) historic King Macbeth, who ruled Orkney and northern Scotland 1040-1058. For good measure, we get Lady Godiva, too. Plus Duncan, Malcolm, and Duke William waiting for his Big Moment in 1066, over there in Normandy.<br /><br />Link at first comment for a fine, short review by reliable Danny Yee: \\"King Hereafter is a dark and sombre work...and at near nine hundred pages not one to be tackled lightly. It is, however, a rewarding feast for those who like solid historical fiction.\\"<br /><br />Nice background for the book at dorothydunnettdot)co(dot)uk/dunnettqa5.htm<br />She read some 700 books for KH! And compiled \\"145 interlocking European family trees, laid out in miniscule writing on a piece of wallpaper 20 feet long.\\" Now, that's research!<br /><br />Anyway, it's reassuring that the historical background is as good as she could make it, plus it's a ripping (hacking, stabbing, disembowelling...) good yarn.

Still Stirling's best book, imo. Compulsively readable, and highly recommended.<br /><br />Gwen Ingolffson, the titular Drakon, is dumped alone into (almost, [1]) OTL in a failed wormhole experiment. A good Drakon superwoman, she  makes First Contact with a mass-murder, and moves smoothly on towards World Domination. Gwen is SF's best female antihero, truly a lovely monster.<br /><br />The ending is perfunctory [2], with a nice leadin to the planned sequel, _Unto Us a Child_. Which, unfortunately, was never finished: (I'd give you the URL, but Amazon would likely censor it. So Google. Hint: drakasequels.html)<br /><br />DRAKON is the only standalone Draka book,the sexiest, and the least gory[3], so if you haven't tried the Drakaverse, this is the place to start.<br /><br />[Pause to read a bunch of old Usenet Drakon discussions. The standout is Jo Walton's thoughtful review; Google Groups.]<br /><br />Anyway, I can see the point of the various nitpicks, especially the one that sees DRAKON as a Draka fanfic, written by the author -- but none of them mattered, while I was reading or rereading the book. Drakon pushed all my right buttons, and, since this isn't a formal review, I don't have to analyze the book, nyah nyah. It's *terrific*, and I look forward to rereading it again sometime in the 2010's.<br />________________________<br />[1] The only argument I came across for this not being OTL, was a comment someone made that all the VN-era fighting was in Cambodia. Note, however, that both the NVA and Viet Cong are specifically mentioned. Did I miss another POD?<br /><br />[2] --but includes a neat reference to Niven's \\"All the Myriad Ways\\".<br /><br />[3] Even so, there are parts that are not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

This is my favorite kind of SF, so I was very pleased to discover CLADE. There are, unsurprisingly, some first-novel rough spots here, particularly with the thriller-style plot, which suffers from some heavy-handed auctorial hammering-to-fit -- but, hey, you'll happily put up with a few warts for the technically-sweet payoffs in CLADE.

Book 2  of the Company series.<br /><br />I thought the Chumash characters were particularly well done, very<br />*California* -- one of the the Humashup tycoons even has a<br />personal shaman. I don't know enough about the Chumash --<br />indeed, almost nothing -- to judge Baker's fidelity-to-history, but I<br />expect she's a trustworthy guide -- (but I do recall picking up<br />some very odd notions about science and history from voraciously<br />naive childhood reading, so comments from the Chumash-history<br />literate are welcome.)  I'm pretty sure coastal California culture has<br />featured wealth, ostentation, flash & showmanship for at least a<br />thousand years.... and, yes, there weren't many more clear, smog-free<br />days in the LA Basin even back when the dire wolves were<br />unwisely leaping onto prey mired in the La Brea tar pits....<br /><br />Anyway.  I have a definite weakness for anthropological SF. &#34;Sky<br />Coyote&#34; might not be up to the best of Le Guin or Arnason, but it has<br />some very fine moments. We were out to the Central Coast (the<br />Chumash, and Baker's, homeland) a few months back, and it is<br />lovely country, lovingly portrayed here. And Baker has a nice<br />command of the tragedy:farce, dark:light transition? mood-swing? --<br />not quite the words I'm looking for, but she plays the reader's<br />emotions skillfully. Really quite an impressive writer.<br /><br />You should probably read &#34;Garden&#34; first (also highly recommended),  but &#34;Sky Coyote&#34; would do fine as<br />a stand-alone.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

Sprague De Camp and Noel Coward for their inspiration; but primarily this world owes its existence to stories made up in preliterate childhood, when the author peered at Maxfield Parrish's fantasy illustrations and tried to imagine what they represented...\\" P>I should add that ANVIL reads something like a Pratchett novel, if Pterry were a native Californian and had a Vancian knack for lush description. The wide-screen plot and wiseass characters are Baker originals. Not to mention Lord Ermenwyr's verbal-abuse death-duel....<br />Do give the book a chance to get moving, as the introduction is largely scene-setting, and it's a bit slow-moving. And the episodic, \\"fix-up\\" structure has annoyed some readers (not me). Otherwise, it's a near-perfect light fantasy:  cinematic, witty, funny, amiable, rambling, baroque, romantic, and fun.

Epstein, who spent most of his career at Random House, remarks on how publishing has changed over the years, with plenty of juicy anecdotes. Forex, the Dickens:<br /><br />As you may know, the US was a book-pirate haven in the 19th century, and Harper Bros. grew to be the nation's largest publisher by pirating Dickens, Thackeray, the Brontes, Macauley -- really, the entire roster of bestselling British authors. Macauley's (pirated) History of England sold a remarkable 400,000 copies here.<br /><br />Charles Dickens, who kept a close eye on revenues, made a trip to the US in the 1840's, to protest the theft of his work. His plea was ignored, and he didn't much like the country, either. He wrote a short, glum account of his visit, _American Notes_, which Harpers promptly pirated.<br />Dickens recounts a train trip from Washington to Philadelphia through what he thought was a storm of feathers, but which proved to be spittle from passengers in the forward coaches. He also reported that US Senators spit so wide of the cuspidors that the carpets were \\"like swamps\\".<br /><br />WH Auden, Epstein reports, had the disconcerting habit of showing up an hour or so early for parties and dinner invitations, so he could be home in bed by 9 PM.<br /><br />Epstein was the first to publish a line of quality paperbacks (Doubleday Anchor) in 1952, and was a founder of the NY Review of Books. From his memoir, I'd say he had an interesting and fun career in publishing .<br /><br />Happy reading!<br />Pete Tillman	2004-01-28

Don't miss!	_____________________________________________<br />I've been looking forward to reading this book, & I'm happy to report<br />that it's great fun - a marvelous concoction of foam & froth.  If you've<br />missed the first two DM books (Crown Jewels & House of Shards, both<br />worth seeking out) -  Maijstral is an impoverished aristo turned<br />Allowed Burglar in the Khosali Empire, a mannered society ruled - or<br />at least with standards set - by faintly canine aliens.<br /><br />A plot summary won't help much here - let's see if I can find an<br />episode that can be yanked out of context:<br /><br />Drake has bested Duke Joseph Bob of Tejas in a duel, scared off a<br />challenge from Capt. Milo Hay, and put off yet another challenge by<br />Prince Hunac of Yucatan.  He's planning the media spin for all this<br />with Duchess Roberta Altunin, his second and inamorata:<br /><br />\\"Excellent.  Then you must tell the media of your plans for a religious<br />retreat.\\"<br /><br />\\"I will.  I'm a hereditary prince-bishop after all - I'll spend the whole<br />night praying for peace.\\"<br /><br />\\"I keep forgetting you're a bishop.  You're not very ecclesiastical.\\"<br /><br />Maijstral composed his face into an expression of piety.  \\"I prefer to<br />keep my devotions private, thank you.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, I'm a hereditary abbess, so I suppose I should not criticize.\\"<br /><br />\\"Really?  Which order?\\"<br /><br />\\"The Reformed Traditional Hospice Order of the Blessed Spatula.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh.  The Spatulates. . .  I wondered why they worshipped a bit of<br />kitchen equipment.\\"<br /><br />\\"They take it out of the vault once a year and make a holy omelette<br />with it . . .  The ceremony is quite moving.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm sure.\\"<br /><br />\\"My piece was a bit leathery when I tasted it, though.\\"<br /><br />--and on and on, skipping lightly from one silly episode to another,<br />never losing  momentum or control.  I lost count of the number of<br />times I laughed out loud.  Other reviewers compare the Maijstral books<br />to Wodehouse or Panshin's Anthony Villiers books.  I liked this one<br />more than the Panshins;  I found it comparable to Wodehouse at his<br />best - high praise indeed.<br /><br />Happy reading!<br /><br />Peter D.

Then it turns<br />to a strange, cool, unblinking vision of a future where ordinary<br />biologic humans are confined to a reservation/retirement home on<br />cozy old Earth, while their &#34;mind children&#34;, advanced machine<br />intelligences, go out to conquer the Universe in a &#34;bubble of Mind<br />expanding at near-lightspeed.&#34;<br /><br />Moravec's mind-bubble will absorb and digest every physical entity in<br />its path, from ancient Voyager spacecraft to entire alien biospheres.<br />(&#34;I am vast. I contain multitudes.&#34;) These absorbed entities, he says,<br />&#34;may continue to live and grow as if nothing had happened, oblivious<br />to their new status as simulations in cyberspace.&#34; Data-storage<br />capacity won't be a problem -- the atoms that make up your body,<br />Moravec tells us, &#34;could contain the efficiently encoded biospheres of<br />a thousand galaxies.&#34;<br /><br />With the entire cosmos transformed into cyberspace, it would be<br />possible for not just our &#34;original versions,&#34; but every variation on<br />them, to &#34;live&#34; as massively-parallel simulations, playing out all of<br />the possibilities of Alternate History, perhaps as entertainment for<br />the vast, cool Intellects that have supplanted us. As Moravec notes,<br />we could already be living as simulations: We might well wonder<br />whether we're the &#34;true&#34; original, or just one of many reruns. &#34;There<br />is no way to tell for sure,&#34; he writes, and since we can never know,<br />&#34;the suspicion that we are someone else's thought does not free us<br />from the burdens of life.&#34;<br /><br />And Moravec's not done. Now things gets *really* weird, as he<br />moves into a&#34;what is reality?&#34; windup that invokes Frank Tipler's<br />Omega Point, anthropic cosmology, parallel universes, and life after<br />death. He does get a little flaky here [note 2], but what a grand<br />Stapledonian blowoff!<br /><br />Science fiction readers will recognize concepts from many of the<br />finest hard-SF novels of the past few decades: Gregory Benford's<br />universe-conquering machine intelligences, Greg Egan's lives-as-<br />simulations, Vernor Vinge's Singularity, Robert Forward's fractal-<br />bush robots. Robert Charles Wilson's current Darwinia<br />could almost be a novelization of Robots.  Moravec's book is an<br />excellent guide to the science behind a lot of recent SF -- and an<br />exciting (if disturbing) preview of what's next.<br /><br />These connections to SF are no accident: Moravec, who co-founded<br />the robotics program at Carnegie-Mellon University, grew up reading<br />science fiction, built two robots for high-school science-fair projects,<br />and first published his robot/AI speculations in an Analog essay in<br />1978, while a student at Stanford. He expanded that piece into a<br />popular-science book, Mind Children (1988, also excellent), which the<br />present book extends and updates. (He promises the next update in<br />2008.) Moravec has also written Omni articles with Robert Forward<br />on space elevators (1981), and with Frederik Pohl on uploading<br />people to computers (1993). Plus he's been a Hollywood consultant<br />for science-fiction movie-makers. Reading through his CV, I wonder,<br />does the man ever sleep?<br /><br />Robot is among the few truly first-rate books of speculative science --<br />books in which respected scientists extrapolate their ideas into<br />the future with some rigor. Other such books include K. Eric<br />Drexler's Engines of Creation (1986), and Freeman Dyson's<br />Disturbing the Universe (1979), Infinite in All Directions (1989), and<br />From Eros to Gaia (1992). Books such as these provide a sense of awe<br />and wonderequal to the very best of science fiction -- perhaps the<br />more wondrous for being, quite possibly, true.<br />Interested readers can find much more information at Moravec's<br />excellent website.<br />__________<br />1) -- if for no other reason than to supply empathetic characters for<br />hard-SF set in the far future -- a challenge that's tough enough<br />without using a Moravecian ultimate-AI for a protagonist...<br /><br />2) To his credit, Moravec recognizes that this chapter has problems.<br />He's promised (and has started) a rewrite on his website.<br /><br />review copyright 1999 Peter D.

This one sat on my 'to-read' shelf for a long time, after I bounced off her first, &#34;Reclamation&#34;, which has an excruciatingly slow start. &#34;Fool's War&#34; was a New York Times Notable Book of 1997 (and Reclamation won a Locus Award for Best First Novel...)<br />The setup is uncomfortably topical -- the story-now is 500 years after violent religious wars, started by Islamic extremists, almost wrecked Earth. The subsequent diaspora to the colony worlds simply spread out the same old hatreds. Now the ugly chickens are flapping home to roost....<br /><br />I can't say very much about Fool's War's plot without spoiling things for you, but Zettel spins an impressively twisty tale. She constantly plays with the reader's expectations, and she (mostly) plays fair -- though her storytelling craft still has some rough spots in this sophomore effort. A cover blurb compares her to Heinlein and Asimov, but there's more than a touch of Van Vogt's signature rapidfire scene-changes here.<br /><br />Fool's War is somethng of a grrrl power-fantasy  -- and I do like a well-done power-fantasy, especially one with a light touch. Here's Pilot Yerusha, in a moment of reflection within the storm of denouement: &#34;I'm saving the human race so I can go on a date...&#34; If you like to see femmes kicking butt that *needs* kicking, you'll like Fool's War.<br /><br />Zettel's authorial hand does get a bit heavy with her villains, and in pointing characters where they need to go for the next plot-twist. But overall it's good, clean fun, and I'll have to do some Zettel catchup reading soon.<br /><br />review copyright 2001 by Peter D. Tillman	2004-01-22

I'd been hesitant to read one of these, despite rave reviews by people<br />I trust - I'm not much of a fantasy reader, & we're talking vampires,<br />zombies and werewolves here.  Well, folks, what we _really_ have is<br />a book in the class of the Harold Shea books - one that bends genres<br />and transcends them.<br /><br />Let me back off a moment, & tell you what I usually read.  I'm in the<br />mining business, educated as a geologist & chemist.  I like my SF hard,<br />& I'm uncomfortable with gore.  So why would I _like_ (let alone<br />rave about) a vampire book with (literally) buckets of blood?  Hint -<br />it's probably not the scene where, as a joke, Anita tosses a cop the<br />severed hand from a dismembered infant...<br /><br />It _could_ be the scene where Anita (5'2&#34;, 102#) disarms a _large_<br />rapist by sticking her derringer in his crotch & threatening to blow his<br />balls off...<br /><br />Anita's hard-boiled alright, but she's an uneasy executioner, a<br />necromancer with scruples, even a soft touch sometimes - she tries to<br />give a pretty prostitute a bus ticket out of town to &#34;start over&#34; (the<br />whore laughs in her face).  The gore is an integral part of the story, &<br />the supernatural is treated as just a part of everyday, late 20th C. life -<br />as alternate history, really (I don't usu like alt hist either).  I'm<br />reminded somewhat of S.M. Stirling's Gwen in &#34;The Drakon&#34; (another<br />A+ book) - tho Gwen is more cheerful at work.  For sure Anita's no<br />Nick Seafort.

Thorne's book got equally good<br />reviews, but my God, the thing's 600+ pages.... so it sat on my \\"to-<br />read\\" shelf for years. This tardy review is intended for others in<br />similar circumstances -- or for anyone interested in modern physics &<br />astronomy.<br /><br />The book is written as a history of 20th century physics, from<br />Einstein's theory of the relativity of space & time (1905), to black<br />holes, gravity waves and wormholes in the 90's. I found this a very<br />engaging approach. Thorne's writing is (usually) clear and direct, and<br />he includes enough biographical tidbits and anecdotes to keep the<br />human juice in potentially dry topics.<br /><br />A few gems:  Einstein's college math professor Minkowski, who had<br />called the young genius a \\"lazy dog\\", later worked out the<br />mathematics combining space and time into \\"absolute spacetime.\\"<br />Einstein made cruel jokes denigrating Minkowski's work, not<br />realizing, until after Minkowski's death, that his old teacher's math<br />was essential to Einstein's special relativity work.<br /><br />Cosmic radio waves were discovered by a Bell Telephone engineer in<br />1932. Despite widespread publicity, professional atronomers weren't<br />very interested -- the first radiotelescope was built by a radio \\"ham\\",<br />in his mother's back yard in Illinois, in 1940. The first professional<br />radiotelescopes weren't built until after WW2, in England and<br />Australia; Americans didn't become competitive until the late 50's.<br /><br />Thorne has a fair command of Russian, which gave him an \\"in\\"<br />when the USSR started allowing scientific contacts in the post-Stalin<br />era. Now that Russia is such a mess, we forget that the Soviets<br />produced a *bunch* of world-class scientists and engineers [note 1],<br />from the 1930's on -- including some of the best physicists since<br /><br />Einstein.<br /><br />Dr. Thorne, the Feynman Professor of Physics at Caltech<br />is best known to the<br />general public for his 1988 wormhole \\"time machine\\" proposal. Press<br />coverage included a photo of the author doing physics in the nude on<br />Mt. Palomar. Embareassing, but didn't hurt the book sales.

Millions of square miles of it... a hundred rippling oceans,<br />each ripple a gleam of scarlet or amber, emerald or turquoise... the<br />colors shivering over the prairies... Sapphire seas of grass with dark<br />islands of grass bearing great plumy trees which are grass again.&#34;<br /><br />So opens Grass, Sheri Tepper's first fully-successful novel and<br />may be her best. My favorite, anyway<br /><br />If you've read any Tepper, you'll have noticed that she takes a pretty<br />dim view of human nature, especially among men -- and of religion,<br />especially patriarchal religion. The standard Tepper themes are here --<br />of course, they weren't standard back then -- but handled lightly and<br />thoughtfully, with only a bit of the didactic ham-fistedness that mars<br />some of her later books. What I didn't remember about Grass is the<br />splendid sense of place she evokes -- Grass emerges as a fully-formed,<br />beautiful, and thoroughly alien world. The formative image of Grass,<br />to the Colorado-born & raised Tepper, is that of the American Great<br />Plains after a good spring, which is indeed an oceanic experience --<br />one that your Oklahoma-raised reviewer has shared,  and misses.<br /><br />Sanctity, the noxious world-religion of Tepper's Earth, is explicitly<br />modelled on Mormonism. Mormon readers ('saints') will not be<br />flattered -- though Tepper has exaggerated for effect. Sanctity is not<br />nice. At times it verges on cartoonish, but then I would reflect on the<br />banality of evil.... Tepper does a good job, handling evil. &#34;Beauty&#34; (1991)<br />is her masterwork of evil -- a remarkable book, but not for the<br />squeamish.  &#34;Down, down, to Happy Land...&#34; Ugh.<br /><br />The Hippae aren't nice, either. Neither are the Hounds, another<br />Grassian species she introduces in the Hunt, and splendidly develops<br />as the novel progresses. I've seen criticism of  Grass's ecology, but to<br />this non-biologist it seems reasonably sound, certainly good enough<br />for fictional background.<br /><br />The extreme isolation and strange behavior of Grass's rural<br />aristocracy are again drawn from Tepper's Western experience. Larry<br />McMurtry has written eloquently of just how strange isolated<br />pioneers could get [note 1], and I remember similar stories from<br />Oklahoma. Tepper, McMurtry and other senior Westerners (like me)<br />are just one lifetime distant from the frontier...<br /><br />Marjorie Westriding -- besides having a wonderful name, and a<br />remarkably irritating husband -- remains Tepper's most memorable<br />character.

Set in the bioengineered nanotech future of &#34;Les Fleurs du Mal&#34; and<br />the eponymous novella, Inherit the Earth is a taut and well-drawn<br />thriller. Life-extension internal technology (IT) is good enough that<br />the people who put the world back together after the Crash and<br />Plague Wars some 75 years before still rule the world, albeit behind<br />the scenes. Stableford is exploring a familiar sfnal question:<br />If rich, powerful people get life-extension first -- as they will -- how<br />do you ever get shed of them?<br /><br />Stableford's writing and characters, at their best, are as good as<br />anyone's in the business. Here's Silas Arnett, a hundred-twenty-<br />something, entertaining his young lover Cathy:<br /> 'She was wearing nothing but a huge white towel, wrapped twice<br />about her slender frame. The thickness of the towel accentuated<br />her slimness -- another product of authentic youth. Nanotech had<br />conquered obesity, but it couldn't restore the full muscle tone....<br />&#34;It must be strange,&#34; she said, insinuating her slender and naked<br />arm around his waist, &#34;to look out on the sea and the sky with eyes<br />that know them so well....&#34;<br />She smiled at him, as innocently as a newly-hatched sphinx.'<br /><br />Stableford acknowledges his editor, David Hartwell, for &#34;suggesting<br />that I rewrite the final section so drastically as to obliterate any<br />lingering similarity to the ending of the earlier version...&#34; Perhaps<br />Stableford should have stuck to his guns -- the last couple of chapters may<br />remind you of Asimov or Heinlein at their most dialogorrheous.<br />Skim. The path from novella to novel is fraught with peril... To be<br />fair, the actual *ending* is crisp and satisfying.<br /><br />And while I'm nitpicking -- the American characters do sound<br />veddy British...<br /><br />...but don't let me put you off from reading the book, which is well-<br />worth your while. Even if the plots, conspiracies, treacheries and<br />wheels-within wheels do get confusing...<br /><br />Note: the attractive cover art SFAICT has nothing to do with the contents.<br /><br />review copyright 1998 by Peter D.

First of all, if you have the slightest interest in the geology of Mars, or in maps, or in planetary science (and, if not, why are you here?) you *need* to read this book.<br /><br />&#34;This is a splendid book and a major achievement in the study of Mars.... A number of authors might fairly claim to have written the best Mars novel, but this is the best factual book on Mars that money can buy.&#34;<br />-- New Scientist, Google for online review<br /><br />Tidbits:<br />&#34;When the investigator, having under consideration a fact or group of facts whose origin or cause is unknown, seeks to discover their origin, his first step is to make a guess.&#34; --GK Gilbert, Science 3(53), 1896 (which codified the method of multiple working hypotheses). Gilbert, of course, was &#34;one of the happy generation of American geologists who...took their impressive beards and intellects to every corner of the American West.&#34;<br /><br />Gene Shoemaker's first map of Meteor Crater, in 1957, was done for the old AEC, as part of a truly crackbrained scheme to manufacture plutonium by detonating uranium-wrapped A-bombs underground. Which, thank heavens, never got very far. Gene didn't like the idea, either, but who's to turn down funding?<br /><br />No map of exotic lands is complete without exotic names, and the map of Mars is well-stocked: Noctis Labyrinthus, the Labyrinth of Night. Tithonium Chasma, Albe Patera --a volcano that occupies an area about equal to that of India --Claritas Fossae, Utopia Planita... Olympus Mons! Formerly Nix Olympica, the Snows of Olympus --and the highest mountain known to humanity. Mauna Kea, Earth's biggest volcano, would fit comfortably inside Olympus' summit caldera. OM contains some 3.5 million cubic km of rock--or the area of Texas, if excavated 8 km deep. This is one *humongous* mountain. And Vastitas Borealis, the northern lowlands, is arguably the flattest place in the solar system.<br /><br />I like the respectful attention Morton pays to science fiction about Mars -- which echoes the attention and affection paid to SF writers by working planetary scientists. Of course, sometimes these are the same people, as with UofA planetologist, novelist (Mars Underground, recommended), photographer, artist and all-around Renaissance man Bill Hartmann; and Geoffrey Landis, a NASA space scientist and part-time novelist (Mars Crossing, recommended) who helped to develop the Mars Pathfinder mission.<br /><br />About the only place that Mapping Mars fails us is in the illustrations. The publisher made a valiant effort, but an octavo-format book just doesn't have the page size for drama. Fortunately, you can Google for suitably-impressive maps and photos of Mars.<br /><br />Peter D.

PHOENIX continues on from the cliff-hanger that ends vol. 1. Phaethon has indeed been banished, ostracized, cast out of the Golden Oecumene, for rocking the boat...<br />I should stop here and reiterate that PHOENIX is emphatically NOT a stndalone. You will absolutely need to start with vol. 1 to make sense of this, and even then, it can be hard going. But worth the effort, and a lot of fun.<br /><br />Anyway, PHOENIX opens with one of the neatest bits of recapitulation I've ever seen, and most welcome, too, as it's been 18 months or so since I read #1. The writing here is considerably smoother than in the first book, and the story is simpler and more linear --though I'm sorry to say the proofreading hasn't improved a bit (sigh). Cool covers, though.<br />OK, here's the reliable Paul Di Filippo, if you'd like a coherent, real review:  [google at scifi.com]<br /><br />\\"Wright dances brilliantly back and forth between... romance and talk of tightly woven superstrings and mesonic disrupters. Another thread is classic space opera: The whole contest between the Golden Oekumene and the Second Oekumene rings of nothing so much as the battle between Arisia and Boskone in Doc Smith's Lensmen series.\\"<br /><br />Sheer narrative pleasure, that's a good way to put it. The first half of #2 is a fairly routine (but fun!) \\"can't keep a good engineer down\\" romp --and I'm doing Wright a bit of a disservice, because there are still a dozen neat ideas per chapter --but PHOENIX really starts to rock when Daphne Tercius Semi-Rhadamanth makes her re-entrance, Daphne Tercius being the successor (sort of) to Daphne Prime, Mrs. Phaethon, who's hiding from him, and reality, inside an impregnable VR vault...<br /><br />Anyway, Daphne3 is bright, sharp-witted, and determined, but Phaethon is so incredibly thick in dealing with her, you want to whack him upside the head. Gah! Their interactions are a delight, even if Phaethon isn't. Plus, we learn more about Atkins Vingt-et-un, the Last Soldier. And move in to Mercury, to fire up the Phoenix Exultant!<br /><br />What can I say? Wright is very, very good for a fast-acting sense-of-wonder recharge, and PHOENIX is a welcome return to straightforward storytelling from the baroque splendors of GOLDEN-1. And I kept getting the frissons of delight, wonder and strangeness that are the reason I read SF. So, guys, it ain't perfect, but I predict Wright's GOLDEN AGE series will be delighting readers for a long time to come. And I'm more than ready for The Golden Transcendence, vol. 3, now available (and should be in my hands RSN).<br /><br />Interview by Nick Gevers (highly recommended):<br />[Google at SF Site]<br />  [on his influences]<br />\\"Jack Vance and Gene Wolfe are masters of style, and I filch from them without a twinge of remorse.

It's his best SF novel in many<br />years; maybe his best yet?  Silverberg dedicates the book<br />to HG Wells - this is the centennial year of \\"War of the<br />Worlds\\" - and, in this 10th year after Heinlein's death, it can<br />hardly be coincidence that the patriarchal protagonist is named<br />\\"Anson\\" [2].<br /><br />The Aliens land \\"seven years from now\\", touching off massive<br />brush fires in the LA basin and, shortly thereafter, seismic changes<br />in humanity's place on our home planet. The alien Entities pay<br />little attention to humans, but any attack on them triggers<br />massive retaliation. Human institutions simply fall apart after the<br />Conquest. This is a long way from ID4 or the optimistic<br />Campbellian invasions of yore . Silverberg is working in terrain<br />similar to Wm. Barton's \\"When Heaven Fell\\", but with a more<br />elegaic tone, something like \\"Earth Abides\\" -- or \\"Nightwings\\".<br /><br />\\"The Alien Years\\" is told thru the viewpoints of the Carmichaels,<br />an old California clan headed by a patriarchal Vietnam-era<br />Colonel. Thru 50 years of Entity rule, the Carmichaels never quite<br />give up hope or the memory of freedom. They are active in a<br />nominal Resistance, but real resistance is almost unthinkable - the<br />last, futile military attack on the Entities resulted in the death of<br />half of humanity. We see the gradual passing of people who grew<br />up free, and new generations coming of age who have known<br />nothing but the unpredictable rule and irresistible whims of the<br />Entities and their quisling government. Silverberg weaves a rich<br />tapestry of life and love, birth and death, hope and despair. Highly<br />recommended. Look for it on the award ballots.<br /><br />Silverberg's best work in this decade has been short-form [3] - in<br />particular the spectacular novellas \\"Letters from Atlantis\\" (1990),<br />\\"Lion Time in Timbuctoo\\" (1990), and \\"Thebes of the Hundred<br />Gates\\" (1992) -- historical fantasies all.

And no one can figure out<br />what this fleetload of well-armed and (literally) slimy aliens really<br />wants...<br /><br />There are some  first-novel rough spots here, but the characters are<br />exceptionally well-drawn, even minor ones -- here's Helen Sasaki,<br />deputy Security chief:  &#34;She is tall, shy, brusque, tenacious and<br />inventive...&#34;  And small, rich details abound -- Halley is speaking:<br />&#34;I once went for three years without seeing another human... It was<br />very... stressful. You have to constantly think... There's no autopilot.<br />You can't trust your common sense, because you have nothing in<br />common with anyone else.&#34;<br /><br />There are loose threads dangling at book's end, but a sequel, Time Past,<br />is promised for next year.  I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br />Maxine McCarthur, an Australian, won the George Turner prize for<br />Time Future. She has lived and worked in the Outback, New Guinea<br />and Japan, as well as urban Australia -- near-perfect preparation for her<br />tales of conflict and intrigue among an amazingly mismatched<br />menagerie of sentients.<br /><br />Review copyright 2001 by Peter D.

Permanence is set in the 25th century, when humanity has<br />settled dozens of extrasolar planets -- the so-called \\"lit worlds\\" -- and<br />thousands of brown-dwarf colonies -- the halo worlds. All the<br />colonies were linked by big, NAFAL [note 1] starships, each travelling<br />a fixed circuit of worlds -- the cyclers [note 2]. The cyclers never stop, as<br />the energy cost to boost them to relativistic speeds is, well,<br />astronomical. Ultralight shuttles transfer passengers, crew and cargo at<br />each port.<br /><br />Permanence is a quasi-religious order set up to support the great<br />starships, and to preserve human civilization for the indefinitely long<br />future. It's a noble and admirable organization, which has been<br />seriously disrupted by the recent discovery of FTL travel -- which, it<br />turns out, will only work near a full-size star. FTL travel is *much*<br />cheaper than the sublightspeed cyclers, so the halo worlds' economies,<br />and the Cycler Compact, are near collapse. It gets worse -- the lit worlds<br />are joining the new Earth-based Rights Economy, an aggressively-<br />centralized property-rights setup that forbids any non-commercial<br />transactions. Hmm -- could this be socially-conscious Canada vs. the<br />great, grasping Colossus of the South? (The halo worlds are cold, too...)<br /><br />Meadow-Rue Rosebud Cassells lit out from Allemagne station when<br />her bullying brother got to be too much. Enroute to Erythrion, Rue<br />discovers, and files a claim on, a new comet.  [Minor *SPOILER*<br />warning -- but no more than is on the dust-jacket.]  Her claim is denied<br />-- her 'comet' is really a spaceship -- but then reinstated:  it's not<br />a *human* spaceship, and it doesn't answer calls, though the drive is<br />still working. Rue must take physical control of the ghost ship to make<br />good her claim, but Powerful Forces want the ship for themselves...<br /><br />The framework of the novel is Rue's growth from scared kid to<br />respected starship captain. I like bildungsromans, and this is a good<br />one. But the real power of Permanence is the good old sense-of-<br />wonder techstuff:  \\"[The colonies] swarmed like insects around<br />incandescent filaments hundreds of kilometers in length. Each<br />filament was a fullerene cable that harvested electricity from<br />Erythrion's magnetic field... The power running through the cables<br />made them glow in exactly the same way that tungsten had glowed in<br />light bulbs... on twentieth-century Earth.\\" I love this stuff. And it's<br />even plausible -- see Schroeder's neat website, kschroeder.com<br /><br />At times Permanence may remind you of Ken Macleod's political SF,<br />though Schroeder is much less in your face (which I prefer). You'll<br />see nods to Pohl's Gateway, Norton's Forerunners, Brin's and<br />Pellegrino's hostile-universe Fermi-paradox ideas... Schroeder's still<br />looking for a distinctive voice,  which is pretty standard for a<br />writer's early books, and anyway he s/t/e/a/l/s *borrows* from the<br />best...<br /><br />Schroeder's very good at delivering the short, sharp shock:  Rue's<br />poor, then she's rich! Oops, bad claim, poor again. Wait, she's rich<br />after all! This 'Perils of Pauline' plot structure works pretty well for<br />most of the book, but was wearing thin towards the end. Again,<br />these are sophomore-book teething problems, easily forgiveable<br />within the terrific story (and backstory!) that Schroeder's got to tell.<br />Which is:  classic, wide-screen space-opera with a sharp hard-sf edge<br />-- my favorite kind of SF! Folks, this is the good hard stuff, which is<br />never in oversupply. So if you haven't yet tried Schroeder's brand of<br />thinking-being's hard-sf adventure stories, Permanence is an<br />excellent place to start. Then you can go back and pick up on last<br />year's Ventus, which might even be better. They're both terrific<br />books.<br />_____________<br />Note 1.)  Not as Fast as Light, an Ursula K. LeGuin coinage. Or is it<br />Nearly as Fast? And did you know that her ansibles are an anagram<br />of lesbians?<br />2.) The cyclers are the neatest part of the backstory -- see<br />Schroeder's website  for the<br />details, which are interesting of themselves (for spaceflight buffs like<br />me, anyway) and spoiler-free. I was a bit disappointed that the cyclers<br />had become obsolete by Permanence time -- well, sort of -- and I hope<br />that Schroeder returns to earlier times in the future history of the<br />Cycler Compact. And I wouldn't be surprised if Ventus turned out to be<br />in Permanence's future...<br /><br />Review copyright 2002 by Peter D.

I'm only about halfway through this, but it's the most impressive<br />Robinson I've read since, since.... well, ever, I guess. This is AH played<br />with the net up, and the writing and characterization are just about as<br />good as it gets. The opening episode -- just after the POD, when the Black<br />Death exterminated humanity in Europe -- is nightmarish, chilling. (My<br />WSOD for this virulent a plague lasted until now -- it's almost<br />vanishingly unlikely that a disease would kill 99+% of its hosts. And if it<br />did, why would it exterminate Europeans, while leaving Asians and<br />Africans largely untouched? Bah. But let's grant KSR his One Impossible<br />Thing -- which, after all, is at least as plausible as time travel -- and move<br />on.)<br /><br />If you would like a real review [caution: minor SPOILERS], read<br />Keith Brooke's excellent one:  [SF is] \\"stories about the present, about the<br />culture in which they are written...  a different lens to look through. And<br />in The Years of Rice and Salt, Kim Stanley Robinson has ground and<br />polished himself a particularly sharp lens.\\"<br />[google, as Amazon censored the URL]<br /><br />The novel is structured as a set of linked novellas, dating from the POD<br />(c. 1400AD) to the present. In this AH, history subsequent to the<br />megadeath is dominated by the Islamic world and by China.<br />The breadth and depth of research here is remarkable, even daunting.<br />For much of it, readers like me will just have to trust the author;<br />fortunately, Robinson's research record in previous works is  excellent.<br />(His taste in politics and economics, otoh, is eminently debatable -- see<br />any rasfw KRS/Mars thread.)<br /><br />Keith accurately points out the strong 'shaggy god' element in the<br />reincarnation scheme.... and the reincarnation sticking-point.<br />The Leonardo sequence, in Samarkand -- very nice.<br />Karen Lofstrom wrote ( at rasfw), in a much-less flattering review:<br />>It was so [very] didactic. I say that even though I tend to like didactic<br />>novels and I share most of KSR's political and religious convictions. If<br />>it irritated me, it would bug the hell out of our resident Libertarians<br />>and Republicans.<br /><br />As a libertarian-leaning Republican, I'm a counter-example to<br />Karen's theory. And for a calibration-point, I've read just<br />about all of KSR's fiction, and enjoyed most of it. I'm always<br />a bit surprised that someone would suppose that readers need<br />to share the writer's politics (etc) to enjoy their work. This<br />would be a dull reading program indeed.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />After finishing it, I'm somewhat less enthused -- the second half<br />brings back the sadly-familiar political speechifying that marred the<br />Mars books. The sad thing is, just a little sharp editing would have<br />salvaged these MEGO speeches/essays, some of which have<br />interesting points & observations. Sigh.<br /><br />Still, it's an impressive book, one that would repay rereading. Part of<br />the fun is, KSR doesn't take himself too seriously. As in the too-fatal<br />Euro-plague -- he has his characters discuss the problem at a<br />conference. They throw out some reasonable ideas -- Nicoll's 'take a<br />bath!' hypothesis among them, and a plague/anthrax double-<br />whammy, which KSR took from current mass-extinction debates --<br />and then conclude that they really don't know, and may never<br />know, why  this plague was so fatal. So at least the author is<br />addressing the weakest point in his 'counter-factual.'<br /><br />As Keith Brooke pointed out, the characters talk about 'counter-<br />factuals', too -- one reinvents the 'history is just one damn thing<br />after another' shtick. And KSR gently reminds us that we're reading<br />a story, a fiction, written apparently by one Old Red Ink, who has<br />foibles and fallacies of his own. In other words, he's sneaking in the<br />Gene Wolfe 'unreliable chronicler' business to muddy the waters:  ie<br />possible *SPOILER WARNING*<br />the whole reincarnation business that ties the various Rice & Salt<br />stories together is an invention -- or at least an embroidery -- by Old<br />Red. Now, this could be viewed as a \\"we woke, and it was all a<br />dream\\" weasel, but I think it's more a reminder that histories are<br />written by historians, who have the usual \\"we won!\\" bias, not to<br />mention the love of a good story. And of course, here we have a<br />counter-factual 'history', written by a novelist, read by a wide<br />assortment of folks who bring there own preconceptions to their<br />reading.... The usual muddle of Real Life, even in AH.<br /><br />So -- I recommend The Years of Rice and Salt to your attention, with<br />the caveat that it has the usual KSR strengths and weaknesses, and<br />so will alternately thrill and annoy you. At least some of the<br />annoyances will make you think. This is a very good piece of work<br />by an author who knows where he's headed, and just how to get<br />there.

The Witches of Karres is an old-fashioned science-fantasy space opera,<br />written with a light, sure touch and with Schmitz's distinctive<br />panache. This is fizzy, sparkly entertainment -- the plot goes tripping<br />and skipping  across  the Galaxy, via some rather appalling<br />transportation devices (such as the well-named Sheewash drive and<br />the dread Egger Route).  Capt.  Pausert and the lively young witch-<br />sisters -- Maleen, the Leewit & Goth -- face pirate attacks, sneering<br />Sirians, sneaky spies, trumped-up legal charges, a corrupt,<br />beautifully slinky shipyard owner with a taste for torture, a mighty<br />Sheem Assassin robot, Worm Weather, and a super-powerful (but<br />reality-impaired) game-playing vatch, among other challenges. Slow-<br />paced action is not a problem here. The plot is preposterous, but<br />unfolds like a wonderfully lucid dream.... sheewash, you're *there*,<br />with another new klatha psi-superpower....  And the characters are so<br />*nice* -- even the villains get a second, or even a third chance to<br />redeem themselves (and most do). And by *nice* I don't mean sticky-<br />sweet, but the lovely warm, fuzzy feeling you'll get as you read<br />\\"Witches\\".<br /><br />The Witches of Karres is a true light classic of the genre, and if you<br />haven't read it yet (or in awhile), you should. It's remarkably fresh<br />for a story that's over a half-century old -- \\"recommended for<br />frivolous relaxation. Abandon moral uplift, all ye who enter here.\\" --<br />Dave Langford,  Ansible<br />For the young, and young-of-heart.<br /><br />I have fond memories of  \\"The Witches of Karres\\", but it turns out<br />I'd only read the much-reprinted 1949 novellette -- it was a real treat<br />to discover I'd never actually read the 1966 novel. The novellette<br />became the first two chapters of the book, which amounts to a fixup<br />[note 1] of four novellettes -- Schmitz never really figured out how to<br />write a novel.<br /><br />This Gollancz \\"Collector's Edition\\" is a handsome trade paperback,<br />with the familiar chrome-yellow plastic-coated cover (that feels so<br />nice when you stroke it....) and hardback-quality paper. The text is<br />apparently photo-reproduced from an earlier edition. My copy has<br />some rather blurry pages, so you may want to scan through the ones<br />on the shelf at your bookstore.<br />__________<br />Note 1)  I believe the only story to see prior publication was the original<br />\\"Witches of Karres\\".<br /><br />review copyright 2001 by Peter D.

Worst Saberhagen I've read.	__________________________________<br />I made it through Saberhagen's new Berserker novel, but just barely<br />-- the opening moves like rush-hour traffic in L.A.:  S - L - O - W.<br />Once it gets moving [around p. 160(!)] it's not too bad. Inside the<br />padding is a pretty decent novellette struggling to get out. Maybe. The<br />characters are so flat, cardboard looks well-rounded. Plot-threads<br />dangle, and logical holes gape. Saberhagen clearly lost interest at the<br />first draft, and his editor didn't send it back for a badly-needed rewrite<br />(bad Tor!). Is he in poor health?<br /><br />Shiva in Steel somehow got a good review in Locus, which is why I<br />bought it (besides having liked previous Berserker stories). So I<br />suppose YMMV, but I doubt it. Trust me -- you don't want to read<br />this one. Reread an old Berserker book instead.

She's the newly-appointed Electoral Librarian in<br />Kostroma's capitol. Drake sets the scene in a leisurely fashion, but<br />once an Alliance-sponsored coup unfolds, the action is fast and<br />furious -- and clever and fun.<br /><br />The Lieutenant is an interesting fellow -- a promising astrogator,<br />he's also an amateur naturalist and a bit of a lady's man. He<br />dreams of command, and is plunged into it to rescue a<br />detachment of Cinnabar sailors cut off in the coup. He proves to be<br />competent and infectiously optimistic: given lemons, he makes<br />lemonade, lemon cream pie or lemon-drop cookies, as the<br />situation requires. He befriends the Librarian, rescues her when<br />the coup turns ugly, and learns that besides being a computer<br />whiz, she's a a crack shot and a cool head. They become an<br />amazingly effective team.

This sort of writing is easy to mock, but it worked for me [note 1]. Mostly.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at how *readable* the book was. Despite Clute's formidable language and background, he didn't lose sight of the fundamentals of SF storytelling -- a crackerjack yarn, larger-than-life heroes, horrible villains, the fate of the universe in the balance... Several times while reading Appleseed, I thought &#34;wow, this would make a *great* dirty comic book&#34; -- think of an unholy melange of Trashman, Marvel, and Love & Rockets. (This is a compliment, by the way.)<br />The naked, smelly, foul-mouthed, priapic male humans got old fast.<br /><br />I suppose this provides an (unwanted) insight into Clute's fantasy life. Heh.  I recall Delaney's bardic heroes as deliberately scruffy, but not smelly (and generally clothed). [Mumble] had far-future post-hygeine people too -- cleanliness no longer being required for health -- but not so unpleasantly graphic. In Clute's future, no one calls a turd a BM.<br /><br />Well -- this should be enough for you to judge whether or not to read the thing. I basically enjoyed it, and might even have another go a few years on to see how much more of the literary backstory I can pick up. But -- &#34;Appleseed is, in a word, daunting&#34; (Jonas). Caveat lector.<br />___________________<br />Note 1) For a calibration-point, I gave up on both Banks' Feersum Enjinn and Hoban's Riddley Walker because of opaque future-dialect language.

Humanity has spread throughout the solar<br />system. The Inner System is bound together -- literally -- by<br />enormous, quasi-organic nanotech cables -- the Met -- which provide<br />both transport and living space. The cableways end at the asteroids,<br />and the Outer System is freer and more tolerant of human-level<br />artficial intelligences. Beyond Pluto is the domain of the sentient<br />cloudships, who dominate the Outer System economy, and who have<br />made the first tentative interstellar settlements.<br />A dictator is emerging in the Inner System, and quickly rises to<br />dominate this closely-bound polity. He is enslaving the 'free<br />converts', the more-or-less pure-software AI's. A war is coming, over<br />what it means to be human....<br /><br />Here's Paul Di Filippo's review, the best I found online:<br />  &#34;Daniel has sat down and rethought all the cliches and tropes of<br />  nanotech, solar system colonization, interplanetary war,<br />  intelligence extension and a dozen other SF fascinations. The<br />  result is a book that is remarkably fresh and alluring, yet one<br />  which deliberately speaks to the past work... of major authors,<br />  continuing that tradition of cross-generational dialogue for which<br />  SF is justifiably famous...<br /><br />  Readers, beware! Complex, sprawling and fascinating as<br />  Metaplanetary is, the book is only the first in a series, and its<br />  cliffhanger ending might frustrate.&#34;<br />Actually, with Paul's warning, you'll be fine -- Metaplanetary ends at<br />a logical place to pause, though it may be some time before Part 2,<br />Superluminal, appears, dammit. Cliff-hanger or no, this is the best<br />book I've read this year, and perhaps since Vernor Vinge's epic A<br />Deepness in the Sky. Folks, this is the Good Hard Stuff.

You can easily judge this for yourself, as he's put up six of the nine stories in the book for free download, along with Bruce Sterling's perceptive intro: link at first comment, per house rules.<br /><br />\\"0wnz0red\\" made quite a stir back in 2002. Also online, see 1st comment.<br />Here's Bruce Sterling's opinion:<br /><br />[quote]There has been a chunk of science fiction influenced by Silicon Valley, but \\"0wnz0red\\" captures the disturbed inner world of the technically sociopathic... This story is fully realized, and it is sarcastic, abrasive, and mind-boggling in a truly novel way. Like Beat writing in its early period, \\"0wnz0red\\" has the dual virtues of being both really offensive and genuinely hard for normal people to understand. This work is therefore truly advanced.[end quote]<br /><br />\\"Craphound\\", the leadoff story, was Doctorow's first published story, about an alien who likes thrift shops. Good weird stuff, and online, too.<br /><br />\\"A Place So Foreign\\", an 18,000 word novella (also online) about time-travel from 1898 to 1975, is a fresh take on an old theme, and well-worth reading, though not quite to my taste.<br /><br />\\"All Day Sucker\\" is a neat, clever short-short original. \\"To Market, To Market: The Rebranding of Billy Bailey\\", personal brand-management at Pepsi Elementary, is crackerjack, my second-favorite in the collection (and overall). Neither is online.<br /><br />\\"Return to Pleasure Island\\" is sort of a Disney satire and didn't do much for me. And \\"Shadow of the Mothaship\\", a weird scientology/alien invasion tale, went completely by me, though it's a favorite of the author. Go figure. Both are online, so you can judge for yourself (and calibrate your taste against mine). \\"Home Again, Home Again\\", an alien nuthouse tale, and \\"The Super Man and the Bugout\\", adventures of a Jewish-Canadian superhero, are good stories that share the \\"Mothaship\\" background. Both are online.<br /><br />So that's it. A good collection, from a fine writer, early in his career.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

Daniel Leary, a young starship captain in the Republic of Cinnabar Navy, and his faithful, deadly Signal Officer Adele Mundy. I liked With the Lightnings, the first book of this series, a lot: &lt;[...] but didn't much care for Lt. Leary, Commanding, the darker sequel. This one's an improvement, I thought, but still....<br />The RCN series is Drake's SF tribute to Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin &quot;Master &amp; Commander&quot; series -- itself a knockoff of Forester's Hornblower stories [note 1]. The sfnalization of Jack Aubrey's Royal Navy is a bit too literal for my taste -- Drake has starships with actual *sails*, complete with sailors in the rigging, and warships exchanging broadsides of solid-shot missiles. Granted, these are Casimir-effect sails, and antimatter-powered missiles that have a top speed of 0.6 c, but still....<br />Leary and Mundy (the fighting librarian!) were a fresh, fun combination in LIGHTNINGS. In this book, they, and their supporting cast, seem a little shopworn. One of the pleasures of a good series is watching the characters and background develop and grow richer from book to book. So far, Leary, Mundy and their universe seem pretty static  -- and I'm starting to think that they aren't really very likeable, or very interesting, people. The plot is episodic, which is fine, but, you know, we've seen this stuff before.... And the auctorial pushing, shoving and hammering-to fit are distressingly obvious.<br />Hmm. I see I haven't said much about what actually happens in the book. And I don't think I will, actually: you can get a plot summary from the Usual Sources, but I don't think it's really going to help you decide whether or not to read the book. Anyway, if you're new to the series, you need to start with #1. And stop there, would be my advice.<br />Bottom line: STARS is decent commercial fiction and a not-unpleasant way to spend a few hours. Fans of Leary &amp; Mundy will want to check it out [note 2]. But Drake has done better. And I believe I'll let someone else take the lead in trying out the next RCN Leary/Mundy book.<br />Baen's cover art comes in for (often well-deserved) brickbats, and this is a prime example. The man in the heavily-armored spacesuit (click on cover to enlarge), who appears to be riding a souped-up Space Ski-Doo --and the four different typefaces in the title, all contribute to, well, an *unusual* cover. Eye-catching, to be sure. It definitely doesn't match my mental picture of STARS...<br />STARS comes with a bonus: a really neat CD, which includes the complete texts for 26(!) of Drake's books, including an audio version of STARS and other cool stuff. This is a new Baen marketing idea, and a good one.<br />_________<br />Note 1). the O'Brian books are popular with a lot of SF fans (including me). And everyone should try at least one Hornblower....<br />Note 2). One hazard the book-reviewer faces is that critical reading of light, commercial fiction may spoil the fun for the reviewer. For this one, I was truly in the mood for a light, escapist read, and read it pretty much like I'd read any such book. It just didn't quite do the job for me, and I'm adding this note to make sure you know that I like Drake, and I like this kind of book, and I think I gave it a fair shake. And it's not a *bad* book -- just a little disappointing. Your mileage may vary.<br />Review copyright 2004 by Peter D. Tillman<br />First published at SF Site.

For hardcore fans only.	_______________________________________<br />I can hear the snickers and 'I coulda told you's from here, but I was in the mood for something swift and silly, OK? -- and I've always had a weak spot for the Callahan stories. Besides, Matt Peckham gave it a pretty good review (B+) over at Scifi Weekly:<br />[...]<br /><br />Well, silly I got. You may recall that Jake Stonebender relocated Callahan's Place (sans the Mick of Steel) to Key West, after a nuclear explosion (in Jake's hands, iirc) vaporized his bar on Long Island. This time, an officious school bureaucrat arrives to check up on Jake's kid, and then a man-mountain racketeer shows up, demanding \\"protection\\" payoffs. The thug, called \\"Little Nuts\\" (his father was Tony Donuts (don't ask)), provides most of the worthwhile moments. Left unexplained is why such an obnoxious creature -- even the Mafia can't stand him -- has survived so long in the Miami underworld, not known for reluctance to shoot first and often. Especially since Tony Jr. lacks the supernatural protection against firearms (not to mention nuclear weapons) that The Place regulars enjoy. The titular con is how they finally get rid of Tony.<br /><br />This is really only enough material here for a couple of short stories, so the rest is filler: bad bar jokes, worse puns, dull inner musings, standard capers by the usual suspects.... I  skipped/skimmed that stuff, so I got swift, too. But I think you'd be pretty annoyed if you'd paid $24 for this.<br /><br />About the only surprise here is that one of The Place oldtimers dies onscreen, permanently (I think). Callahan doesn't appear, even when called. And the cover art (by Jeff Fischer) is unusually clumsy. Not recommended.<br /><br />Sadly, Pete Tillman	2004-01-04

Just finished this &#34;speculative nonfiction&#34; book by one of my<br />favorite SF writers. Eh. It's structured &#34;as told by&#34; a UFO abductee<br />(nudge, wink), or as Bruce Sterling writes in the intro: &#34;This book is not<br />the puerile ravings of a UFO-stricken madman, but a *firmly<br />controlled, intelligent* hallucination....&#34;<br /><br />Umm. The ideas are mostly recycled from Rucker's fiction (where I<br />much preferred them), and told in the kind of fake-future dialog<br />that I've always *loathed* in pop-sci books. Admittedly, RR's<br />novelistic talent shines through at times, but it's a pretty clunky<br />book overall.<br /><br />The morning after finishing &#34;Saucer Wisdom&#34;, the Nov 99 Analog<br />arrived, and Tom Easton notes, in a generally favorable review, that he prefers RR's<br />pop-sci books to his fiction. Although I agree with Easton's reviews<br />more often than not, I think just the opposite here..<br /><br />So who knows? Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't.

The ship is very old, perhaps as old as the<br />universe.... and big. Really big.<br /><br />The new owners put the Great Ship into service as -- the galaxy's<br />grandest cruise-liner! All lifeforms and sentients are welcome -- if<br />they can afford the fare. By the time of our story, 50,000 years later,<br />there are some 200 billion passengers and crew aboard, a fifth of the<br />way through a leisurely circumnavigation of the Milky Way....<br /><br />Then, a Mars-size \\"planet\\" is discovered, somehow suspended at the<br />very core of the Great Ship! A team of the Ship's best and brightest<br />officers are sent to explore the mysterious \\"Marrow\\" -- and are<br />stranded there by a wild energy-storm. Complications ensue, and<br />things, it turns out, are not as they seem....<br /><br />Humans of this age are heavily gengineered, long-lived, tough and<br />very hard to kill. Indeed, the Master Captain, and many of her<br />officers, have served onboard since the Ship's commissioning. So<br />their perspective on long-term projects, and risk, is considerably<br />different than yours and mine.<br /><br />This may sound like a Doc Smith adventure-story, and it shares his,<br />umm, non-rigorous treatment of basic science (but is much better-<br />written). Marrow works best as mind-candy science-fantasy -- the<br />grand sweep of events kept my suspension of disbelief intact until I<br />started thinking things over for this review. I usually find dumb,<br />sloppy science irritating -- and<br />Marrow suffers from this in retrospect, but I still liked the book.

His book joins such<br />distinguished predecessors as Hans Moravec's \\"Mind Children\\" and Eric<br />Drexler's \\"Engines of Creation\\":  speculative-science books more<br />interesting (and certainly more rigorous) than most science-fiction.<br /><br />From Babbage, Dr. Rawlins  turns to Alan Turing, \\"another farsighted<br />English mathematician who dreamt of machines that manipulated<br />information...  Like Babbage before him, Turing saw so far ahead that he<br />never understood why he had to explain everything he foresaw to the<br />government.\\"  Like Babbage, he lost his funding and his heart.<br /><br />Convicted of homosexual acts in 1952, he was forced to undergo chemical<br />castration.  He killed himself in 1954.<br /><br />Rawlins treats the maddening inflexibility of present-day programs:  we<br />can blame David Hilbert (c. 1900).  \\"Hilbert wanted a completely<br />mechanical way to solve any mathematical problem; something like<br />directions in a cookbook, only more precise...  Although he never knew<br />it, he was asking for computer programs...  We'll eventually have to<br />give up our Hilbertian total-control philosophy and let our machines be<br />more adaptive.  Because we're already losing control.\\"<br /><br />\\"The answer to \\"Could computers think? is that it doesn't matter...<br />What matters is whether we *think* they think.\\"  His discussion of AI is<br />succint and illuminating:  \\"A future of smart machines is strange<br />indeed...  it may be much harder to kill yourself by turning on a gas<br />oven or running a car in a locked garage - both your oven and your car<br />may figure out what you're trying to do and prevent you...  Possessions<br />might get more dangerous, too...  Are we ready for a world of feral<br />cars?\\"<br /><br />\\"As Thoreau said long ago, we've become the tools of our tools...

Now up to #8, it has spawned a \\"best-<br />of\\", and it's pretty good: two Niven shorts, a Bear/Stirling<br />novelette, and a Pournelle/Stirling short novel.<br /><br />The Niven opener, \\"The Warriors\\"(1966) has a certain clunky<br />charm - it was his first Kzin story *and* the first story he tried to<br />sell. He dreamed it up in math class, working up to flunking out<br />of Caltech, and rewrote it for years, \\"trying out what I was learning<br />from my correspondence writing course.\\" It's enough to give an<br />amateur writer hope.<br /><br />Niven #2, \\"Madness Has its Place\\" (1990), is professional but<br />minor.  In \\"The Man who would be Kzin\\"(Bear & Stirling, 1991), a<br />powerful projective telepath leads the Kzin Second Invasion Fleet<br />into disaster. It's clever, logical and smoothly-written. I enjoyed<br />rereading it.<br /><br />Pournelle & Stirling's \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\"(1992)<br />occupies 2/3 of the book. It's not flawless, with a pointless Buford<br />Early/ARM-as-Illuminati subplot, plus it's a sequel (to \\"The<br />Children's Hour\\") -- but it moves smartly (after a slow start) and if<br />the ending doesn't raise up the hair on the back of your neck, you<br />probably shouldn't be reading this stuff.<br /><br />I believe all 8 of the Man-Kzin collections are still in print, and<br />the publisher obviously hopes you'll go out and buy more after<br />reading this \\"teaser\\" collection. Be warned -- they're habit-<br />forming. The series remains high-quality throughout, with<br />very few clunkers. It's pretty much required reading for Known<br />Space fans. My personal favorite is Dean Ing's \\"Cathouse\\" &<br />\\"Briarpatch\\", actually a novel, awkwardly split between MKW#1 & #2.<br /><br />Review copyright 1998 by Peter D. Tillman	2004-01-03

There are better stories in Ballard's<br />Vermilion Sands collection, which is well-worth seeking out --<br />especially if you're new to Ballard, or to land-coral, sonic statues and<br />the eccentric habitues of Vermilion Sands, a future seaside resort in<br />picturesque decline.<br /><br />\\"Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes\\" is a solid Harlan Ellison \\"down & out in<br />Las Vegas\\" tale:  the protagonist drops his literal last dollar into a slot-<br />machine and hits the jackpot -- three blue eyes across, intead of three<br />cherries. Then he hits the jackpot again -- and again. Someone in<br />there likes him...  A nicely-done urban fantasy, with a nasty twist.<br /><br />Then-new writer Gary Wright has faded so far from view that he<br />doesn't even rate an entry in the current Encyclopedia of Science<br />Fiction, but I think you'll like his \\"Mirror of Ice\\", a gripping story of<br />future toboggan-races on suicidally-steep courses. The nameless<br />viewpoint racer is making 'one last run', and it's a dilly. Fine<br />straight-ahead sports-adventure writing -- hasn't aged a bit. I wonder<br />what became of Wright?<br /><br />Samuel R. Delaney won the short-story Nebula for \\"Aye, and<br />Gomorrah...\\" -- he also took home the novel award that year for The<br />Einstein Intersection. Delaney's spacers have had... unusual surgical<br />adaptations -- \\"loose, swinging meat\\" -- and troll for Earthbound<br />frelks -- space-groupies -- on their time off. \\"Gomorrah\\" has<br />resonances I missed back in the sixties, but it's a fine, memorable<br />story on any level.<br /><br />\\"Gonna Roll the Bones\\" is my favorite Fritz Leiber: it's unbelievably<br />good, one of the best SF novelletes ever written -- more than<br />deserving of the 1967 Nebula it won. If you've been reading SF for<br />awhile, you'll remember this one -- it's another gambling story,<br />which develops into a deal with the devil. Joe Slattermill, Mr. Guts<br />the cat, the Big Gambler, Lottie the dice girl, whose \\"long, skinny<br />white-gloved arm... snaked out like an albino cobra\\" -- are<br />unforgettable. What a story! The sfnal apotheosis of the American tall<br />tale. Michael Swanwick writes that \\"Gonna Roll the Bones\\" is \\"a<br />story so good it makes my teeth ache with jealousy.\\" If you've<br />somehow missed \\"Bones\\", well -- here's your chance, and the rest of<br />the book is gravy. I've read this story countless times, and it gets me<br />every time. And -- it has the best last line in the history of SF. See if<br />you agree...<br /><br />I remember bouncing off Michael Moorcock's \\"Behold the Man\\"way<br />back when, and I read it this time mostly out of a sense of duty,<br />Nebula-winner or no. Moorcock just doesn't write to my taste, most<br />of the time, anyway. The plot here is simple enough: time-traveller<br />Glogauer is stranded in Judea, 29 AD. He's rescued by John the Baptist<br />and the Essenes, and...  well, let's say he develops a serious Messiah-<br />complex.<br /><br />\\"Behold\\" is certainly well-written and researched, and has a socko<br />finish,  but I just don't care about religion -- or Mr. Glogauer, or his<br />neurotic girlfriend. \\"Behold\\" is written in a self-consciously 'literary'<br />style, which put me off, too. Anyway,  editor Zelazny asks us to \\"read<br />[Behold] very carefully, please\\" -- but life is short. Hell with it.<br />But do give it a try -- tastes differ. Anyway, who do you trust -- me, or<br />the Nebula voters?<br /><br />I was underwhelmed with Anne McCaffery's<br />Dragonriders of Pern series, but \\"Weyr Seach\\" is where it all began,<br />and it is interesting to see the setup of the sfnal premises for the<br />series. Her fans will enjoy \\"Search\\" , but 'mild pleasure' is the best I<br />can say after rereading this one.<br /><br />Happyreading!<br />Peter D. Tillmanreading!<br />Peter D. Tillman	2004-01-03

Granted, it's hard to write a sensible invasion story, given that<br />a) it's hard to think of a reason for rational aliens to invade, and<br />b) if they did, they should win overwhelmingly. See rifles vs. spears.<br />But it makes a great *story*, and N&P have given probably as<br />reasonable a backstory as anyone could. As an example of high-level<br />page-turner storytelling, Footfall still rings my chimes. I've read it<br />three times, plus the last time I picked it up a couple of years ago, to<br />jog my memory to reply to a post, I got sucked in again and spent the<br />afternoon rereading the good parts. \\"Orion will Rise\\" -- all right!<br /><br />Footfall is dragged down a bit by dated political background: the<br />USSR is alive and well here, and is portrayed as considerably<br />stronger and healthier than it actually was in 1985. I'd skim over the<br />Russian scenes; in fact the book is pretty slow-moving until the<br />aliens arrive, so a quick skim of most of this early scene-setting<br />material is all you need.<br /><br />And make no mistake, once the action starts, you'll have no further<br />complaints. Good stuff, guys.<br /><br />Happy reading!<br />Peter D. Tillman	2004-01-03

Original title: The Thirteenth Majestral	Rating: \\"A-\\" -- very cool, very Vanceian dinosaur-adventure tale.<br />Jack Vance fans shouldn't miss this one.<br /><br />My copy of this had gone astray, so I picked up another at the used<br />bookstore the other day. I'd forgotten how Vanceian it is -- not really<br />a pastiche, it reads pretty much like a mid-period, mid-quality Vance<br />SF novel. 10-year old Kerryl Ryson pulls a prank that humiliates an<br />offworld grandee and starts a riot. As a result, his father is executed,<br />and Ryson and his whole clan are enslaved. Ryson grows up obsessed<br />with vengeance. He makes a galaxy-wide search for the Immaculate<br />Ultima of Aberdown, who ordered his father's death. Along the way,<br />he encounters exotic worlds, strange people, stranger religions, and<br />acquires a luxurious space yacht from one Baron Bodissey, in case<br />you're still wondering who the book reminds you of... Even Vance's<br />signature footnotes are here.<br /><br />Ryson's search eventually brings him to old Earth, which has become<br />an extraordinarily reclusive, stratified world, with the arrogant,<br />aristocratic Palatines served by pallid, puling leperons, an artificial<br />human subspecies (another Vance trademark). He meets the<br />beautiful but troubled Yveena Soolis, and the tale is resolved with<br />some (somewhat) surprising revelations. Yes, dinosaurs are featured,<br />along with possibly the silliest explanation yet for their demise.<br />I really like The Thirteenth Majestral, and I'm pretty sure that you<br />Vance fans will like it too. Peirce's hommage to Vance is, well, just<br />about as entertaining and well-done as the real thing. Check it out.<br /><br />Happy reading!<br />Peter D. Tillman	2004-01-03

It's reasonably<br />self-contained, though you'll enjoy it more if you've read some of<br />the preceeding books, all of which I've liked.<br /><br />Esmay Suiza (the Hero) is a likeably nerdy young officer. Her heroic<br />exploits overshadow her difficult childhood, her love life is terrible,<br />she's had a bad-hair *life*... When Brun, rich, spoiled & beautiful,<br />breezes into her life with hairdressing tips, & then goes after Esmay's<br />secret beau... Well! Another reviewer (alright, Christina Schulman)<br />comments that \\"these confident, decisive people behave like<br />insecure teenagers when they're thrown together at Command<br />School...\\" Ah, but I think that's precisely Moon's point -- Cupid's<br />tardy arrow will turn someone like Esmay, a seriously repressed<br />overachiever, to instant mush. Personal resonance here: Ms. Moon<br />and I were classmates at Rice in the mid-sixties (though I don't<br />think we ever met), and I'm willing to bet she was a TRG, just as I<br />was a TRB -- earnest, nerdy, bad hair, socially-awkward, sexually-<br />repressed... oh god, it's excruciating just to think about those times...<br /><br />Anyway, Moon's delightfully Wodehousian aunts-in-space arrive<br />just in time to save Esmay's butt (and career), and young love<br />prevails...  As usual, Moon's fast-&-furious action, meticulous<br />military-medical backgrounding, and formidable storytelling skills<br />carry the day. There's another Suiza-Serrano-Familias novel<br />coming, and I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br />Rules is Moon's fifth book set in her Familias Regnant<br />universe -- a  rather implausible interstellar plutocracy with<br />corruption/kleptocracy/rejuvenation problems -- threatened<br />by, eg, the Bloodhorde barbs-in-space (Hero) and the NuTexas<br />Godfearing Militia (Rules). This background was light<br />entertainment for the Heris Serrano series, but Ms. Moon seems<br />to have a bit deeper intentions for the Esmay Suiza books, and the<br />backstory creaks ominously under the load. After this OCC (obligatory<br />critical carp), I should note that she is simply carrying on an historic<br />space-opera convention, and the the scratchy backstory will interfere<br />little (if at all) with your reading pleasure.<br /><br />Happy reading!<br />Pete Tillman/>entertainment for the Heris Serrano series, but Ms. Moon seems<br />to have a bit deeper intentions for the Esmay Suiza books, and the<br />backstory creaks ominously under the load.

Rating: \\"A-\\" -- beautiful photos, interesting history and people.<br />Not to mention a great place to visit.<br /><br />Josef Muench smacked Adolf Hitler with a well-aimed tomato back<br />in 1927; prudently, he moved to the US the following year. He got a<br />job with the Ford Motor Co., kept it until he could afford a new<br />Model A ($535), and headed West. His big break came when he met<br />Raymond Carlson, the editor who turned \\"Arizona Highways\\" from<br />an obscure highway-promotion magazine into a world-famous<br />showcase for landscape photography. Muench made his first trip to<br />Monument Valley in 1935, and by 1992 had made 355 trips there,<br />while becoming one of the world's leading landscape photographers<br />(his son David may be even better). Josef took the cover photo of this<br />little book in 1937, the year they started selling Kodachrome color<br />film. You'll recognize many of the classic views here, taken over the<br />next 60 years.<br /><br />Harry Goulding moved to Monument Valley in 1923 to open a<br />trading post, which is still \\"the place\\" to stay when you visit. Times<br />were tough in the Depression -- no money, no business, no jobs. But<br />Hollywood was making Westerns, so Harry decided he'd sell the<br />studios on making movies in Monument Valley. Muench made up<br />a portfolio of photos for Goulding to bring to Hollywood, still<br />considered by some to be his best work. By pure persistence, Harry<br />worked his way up to John Ford, and layed out Muench's pictures.<br />Ford decided that Monument Valley was *the* location to shoot his<br />next big picture, \\"Stagecoach\\" (1938). He had to import cowboys, but<br />Indians came with the package. The rest, as they say, was history -- if<br />you've watched western movies, you've had a preview of<br />Monument Valley.<br /><br />Monument Valley, a Navajo Tribal Park, straddles the Utah-Arizona<br />border in the vast Navajo Reservation.

Infinity Beach stands out for its polished, adult prose, and for its<br />complex, conflicted characters, muddling through life. McDevitt's<br />writing is clean and mature. The plot is twisty, genre-bending,<br />romantic, recomplicated. Experienced readers will have seen all of his<br />plot-elements before, but McDevitt plants enough red herrings to keep<br />you guessing (me, anyway). This is a world-class novelist writing at the<br />height of his powers. A Nebula award nominee, and not to be missed.<br />Infinity Beach features some of the creepiest aliens since, well, \\"Alien\\".<br />At least three times, I felt the hair rise up on the back of my neck.... it's<br />been awhile since that's happened.

If you've<br />  never read McDevitt before, you couldn't find a better book to<br />  start with than Infinity Beach, a nail-biting neo-Gothic tale that<br />  blends mystery, horror, and a fascinating look at how first contact<br />  with an utterly alien species might happen. I simply couldn't put<br />  it down - I was up until long past midnight and loving every minute<br />  of it.

It's been twenty years since humanity was driven from Earth and<br />the Inner System by a runaway Bloom of mycora, a [nano]<br />\\"technologically generated lebensform\\" (TGL) that's eaten all of<br />Earth's life, and most of its crust. Humans have retreated to the<br />moons of Jupiter and the asteroids -- the Immunity (Munies) and<br />Gladholders, respectively -- where constant vigilance is required to<br />keep the Mycosystem at bay. The mycora are generally thought to<br />have been created in an industrial accident, but human malice -- or<br />an extrasolar origin -- can't be ruled out.<br /><br />The viewpoint character is a part-time newsnet<br />columnist in Ganymede, a member-state of the Immunity -- a<br />rather Teutonic, no-nonsense culture, contrasted nicely with the<br />more laid-back, Latinate culture in the Gladholdings. The<br />Gladholders appear to be more technically advanced.<br /><br />The Munies are sending a well-protected (they hope) ship to the<br />Inner System -- the first since the Evacuation -- to plant sensors and<br />scout the Mycosystem. The ship leaves early, after a sabotage<br />attempt, and makes an unscheduled stop in the Gladholdings for<br />fuel and supplies....<br /><br />Beh. I didn't set out to write a plot summary. As in many SF novels, the plot and characters are there to support the Neat Ideas -- of which there are *lots*. And McCarthy writes in a crisp modern style that is more than adequate.<br /><br />Did I mention the ladderdown transmutation reactors? The cryonic<br />witch's tits? The Philusburg Optima (release 1.4) phage ?<br /><br />Hmmph. Am I getting across here? Sometimes these reviews just<br />about write themselves. Other times, like now, I end up with<br />disjointed bits and pieces all over the screen.... What I'm trying to say is, this is a *really good* book. If you like the Good Hard Stuff, this is your kind of book. So go read it, OK? Or read it again, if it's been awhile....<br /><br />This is my third reading of BLOOM. I read it in 2000, 2008 & 2015.

Worth reading for the opener and the bleeding-edge sci-tech.<br /><br />The Collapsium opens with a wonderful novella,\\"Once Upon a Matter Crushed\\" (first published in SF Age 5/99). In the late 25th century, in the eighth decade of the Queendom of Sol, gravitation and the zero-point field are pretty well understood. \\"Neubles,\\" diamond-clad neutronium spheres, are in everyday use -- a standard industrial neuble masses a billion tonnes, and has a radius of 2.67 cm. Our Hero, superscientist Bruno de Towaji, is experimenting with collapsium, a dangerous, metastable material made of proton-size black holes, when he receives a Royal Summons: the new near-solar collapsiter ring is unstable, and will fall into the sun (and eat it) unless Something is Done....<br /><br />The book is written in an engaging neo-Victorian style -- McCarthy's first experiment with literary Style, vs. his previous 'transparent' prose. I liked it. Witty repartee, amusing pratfalls and shrewd insights abound. Bruno meets a well-married couple at a celebrity fund-raiser on Maxwell Montes, Venus:  \\"The love, shyness and exasperation between them radiated out in invisible rays, like infrared. Warming.\\" Befuddled by a bottomless beer mug, Bruno warms to the pitch:  \\"Would, ah, would a hundred trillion dollars be enough?\\"<br /><br />McCarthy's sci-tech extrapolation is exotic, fun and reasonably plausible. He's clearly done his homework -- the book includes 30 pages of appendices, a glossary, technical notes (including the working equations to synthesize neubles), and respectable references. Fun stuff (really!), one of the highlights of the book.<br /><br />The range and depth of McCarthy's imagined technologies are dazzling -- I'm reminded of Drexler's pioneering \\"Engines of Creation,\\" and I hope McCarthy (or someone) does a speculative-science article on the technological implications, if the zero-point field explanation for gravity turns out to be correct. (If  you've seen one, I'd appreciate hearing about it.) Lots more neat SF ideas where these came from....<br /><br />So I was really pumped, reading the first hundred pages -- cool science, nice Style, nifty characters, a big-screen space-opera storyline. What's not to like?<br /><br />Well, the rest of the book? The first thud comes when Bruno is recalled to the inner system -- to fix the same problem again! Then he has to fix it a *third* time, with even sillier, pulpier results.  His scientific competitor, and rival for the Queen's affection, turns out to be a really Horrid Villain.... And the characters are hard to kill, because they have backups, except when they don't -- but wait, maybe they do, after all.... And characters start acting, well, out of character. And there's a pointless, dangling subplot, among other loose ends. I suppose McCarthy intended to write a good old-fashioned super-science melodrama, except with real science -- but the last two-thirds of the book just didn't work, for me anyway. Dammit.<br /><br />Which is a pity, because \\"Crushed\\" is brilliant, and the science is so cool. Oh well -- I'd rather read an ambitious failure than a potboiler. If you're already a McCarthy fan, or crave bleeding-edge hard SF, you won't want to miss The Collapsium -- the good parts anyway. And who knows, your tolerance for melodrama may be higher than mine -- other reviewers have been more generous.<br /><br />But if you're new to McCarthy, I'd start with Bloom or another, earlier book -- and you should try him, he's very good. Usually. Maybe next time he should coast a little on the science -- both the Bloom and Collapsium universes have plenty of room for more stories -- and work harder on the fiction.<br /><br />review copyright 2000 by Peter D.

The stories collectively form something<br />of a prequel to the Reality Dysfunction, and Hamilton presents a<br />detailed future-history timeline as interstitial material.<br /><br />The core of the book is the previously-unpublished title novella, a<br />twisty murder-mystery/police-procedural set in the first Edenist<br />bitek habitat, a He(3)-mining outfit in orbit around Jupiter. The<br />protagonist, a tough, competent corporate cop with a shaky<br />marriage, is straight out of Greg Egan or Ed McBain. The setting is<br />nicely-extrapolated nearish-term hard-SF -- not a dead-demonic<br />possession in sight, thank heavens.  I found it cleaner & more<br />plausible than his \\"Greg Mandel\\" sf-mysteries. Highly<br />recommended.<br /><br />The other stories range from excellent (Tiarella Rosa, Escape Route)<br />down to a couple Hamilton might better have left in the trunk.<br />All feature his trademarks: a glossy, hi-tech future, larger-than-life<br />characters, lots of sex & violence.  It's interesting to see Hamilton<br />working at shorter lengths, and US readers are unlikely to have<br />seen these stories before, except perhaps \\"Escape Route\\", reprinted<br />in the Dozois Year's Best for 1997.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

Which is a<br />shame, since it's quite a good book. All this preliminary blather is because I<br />can't quite figure out how to review it.<br /><br />Hmm. Well, it's good and I liked it....<br /><br />OK. Mr. James is a medievalist, a long-term SF reader and fan, and is the<br />editor of  Foundation: The Review of Science Fiction, a UK academic<br />journal. He writes well, knows SF, doesn't drift off into lit-crit la-la land (or<br />at least not very often), and I learned some Neat Stuff and had a good time.<br />Better?<br /><br />He writes that the book is \\"intended as an introduction to science fiction...<br />for those who know little about it.\\" I can't imagine such a person reading<br />this book unless required to do so, and can only suppose that he was hoping<br />for textbook sales to college science-fiction classes. That such classes are now<br />pretty common is still mind-boggling, for me anyway.<br /><br />So, if you like reading SF criticism, see if your library has a copy. Or -- heck --<br />live it up and drop a tenner at amazon.co.uk. I promise that Mr. James is at<br />least as amusing, and far more eloquent, than your present reviewer.<br /><br />Happy reading!<br />Peter D. Tillman	2003-12-29

His editor asked him to cut it from 220,000 to 150,000 words; as<br />published it was 160,087. It was reissued from the original<br />manuscript in 1991, and I just got around to reading this \\"uncut\\"<br />edition. I  first read STRANGER in the early sixties -- it's the only<br />\\"major\\" Heinlein I'd never reread (unless you count _To Sail the<br />Sunset Sea_ as major).<br /><br />STRANGER hasn't aged well. Ostensibly set in the 21st century, it<br />reads like the 1950's. News commentators are \\"winchells\\" and<br />\\"lippmans\\" -- I recognize the names, but remember nothing else<br />about the originals; do you? The bad guys and minor characters are<br />purest cardboard. Women (\\"bims\\") have the \\"liberty permitted cats<br />and favorite children\\"; homosexuals are \\"poor in-betweeners\\". The<br />world beyond the USA is almost invisible.<br /><br />Jubal Harshaw, the writer, patriarch and \\"father of all\\", is a self-<br />indulgent know-it-all given to long, hectoring speeches. The<br />women are quick to shed clothing and inhibitions, and couple with<br />any water-brother. They grow younger, more beautiful -- and more<br />exhibitionist -- as they learn Martian mind-control. Feh.<br /><br />And yet, and yet .... STRANGER still works as a novel -- I reread it<br />pretty much at one go. The idea of a child raised from infancy by an<br />alien race ... Valentine Michael Smith's journey from innocence to<br />full humanity to New Messiah ... the cheerfully crass<br />commercialism of the Church of Foster ... the silly-but-serious<br />mysticism ...  Heinlein, whatever his flaws, was a master story-<br />teller.<br /><br />STRANGER was Heinlein's first crossover bestseller, becoming<br />something of a Sixties icon -- peace & love, y'know. Bits and pieces<br />were taken up in pop music and culture:  \\"Discorporate, and you'll<br />be free\\", urged the Mothers of Invention. Grace Slick of the<br />Jefferson Airplane sang of \\"sister-lovers, water-brothers\\". The<br />ability to grok was briefly important, if mostly forgotten now.<br /><br />Should you read, or reread, STRANGER? Mmmph. I don't regret<br />doing so, but the book stays pretty low in my mental ranking of<br />Heinlein novels. And if I were you, I'd hunt up the earlier edition --<br />the restored 70,000 words add little but bulk to the story.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

Then the characters in Sue's imagination start<br />giving her advice in RL....<br /><br />In RL/OTL, Sue's husband Fred is bucking for promotion to<br />manager at the local Home Depot. Fred's boss's boss is an<br />unctuous womanizer who comes on to Sue at a dinner party. She<br />swats him down; he keeps trying. It gets quite weird. Sue never<br />forgets that she's making up her interior voices -- she doesn't<br />think she's going crazy -- but she takes her characters' imaginary<br />lives (and advice) pretty seriously. Of course, Sue herself is an<br />imaginary character, created by a pseudonymous author....<br /><br />Heydt intermixes fantasy and real-life with no typographic<br />indication of what's what [note 1]. This works pretty well, but can be<br />confusing and, at times, precious. As I got deeper into the book,<br />I got more interested in Sue and started skipping over the more<br />generic fantasy episodes -- though the fantasy does come to a<br />rousing and effective finish. And Sue's a new woman: she's<br />redecorated her house, reinvigorated her marriage, and gotten<br />the PTA involved in building a new computer lab at her kids'<br />school. The weird womanizing boss is still around, too.<br /><br />The Interior Life was Heydt's first novel, and is to some extent<br />apprentice-work (\\"There is a great host,\\" Denis said, \\"several<br />hundreds at least, on cats, coming slowly toward us.\\"). I don't<br />regret reading it, but would add a mild caveat to the fulsome<br />praise in rasfw that led me to read the book. Perhaps I should add<br />that I'm just an occasional fantasy-reader.<br /><br />Note 1). Apparently the author intended the typefaces to be<br />different.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

Highly<br />recommended.<br /><br />This is the story of the discovery of the Ekati diamond mine, in the<br />Barren Lands of the Northwest Territories, by Chuck Fipke, Hugo<br />Dummett, and others. Hugo Dummett signed on with Superior Oil in 1978 to prospect for<br />diamonds in North America, just as the science of using indicator<br />minerals -- pyrope garnets, chrome diopside and chromite -- for<br />diamond exploration was being worked out. Superior started<br />prospecting around Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds -- now<br />inconveniently a State Park. Hugo and Mike Wolfhard hired Chuck<br />Fipke and his crew to sample the area. Lots of fun with jungly brush<br />and shotgun-toting landowners... Hugo even tried to sweet-talk Gov.<br />Bill Clinton into leasing him the park!<br /><br />Fipke is a poster child for the space-case prospector-geologist, but he's<br />smart, has a sharp eye and was an *amazingly* hard worker. But a<br />*terrible* boss -- he drove his workers to exhaustion, and wouldn't<br />take elementary safety precautions, even on helicopter-supported<br />work. It's remarkable he didn't kill anyone.<br /><br />The road to Ekati was not direct. Superior's exploration program (and<br />their competitors') went down the usual side tracks and dead ends --<br />including rediscovery of the salted site of a 19th century diamond<br />fraud. Then -- just as Fipke & company were developing some truly<br />good-looking Barren Lands prospects -- Mobil Oil bought Superior,<br />and summarily axed all Canadian exploration.<br /><br />Fipke and Dia Met scrambled for money from family, friends and<br />penny-stock speculators, raising enough to stake a sizeable claim-<br />block near Lac de Gras, in the trackless barrens a couple hundred<br />miles northeast of Yellowknife. Then the money was gone, and none<br />of the pros were interested in Dia Met's \\"moose pasture.\\" Bankruptcy<br />loomed -- but Dummett landed a new job with BHP, with a healthy<br />budget, and he quickly leased the Fipke-Dia Met ground.<br /><br />Word of the BHP deal brought De Beers, Corona and others into the<br />area, but the *real* excitement started when BHP's first drillhole<br />found diamonds -- lots of diamonds! Despite strenuous secrecy<br />efforts, the word got out -- as it always does -- and the Great Diamond<br />Rush of 1991 was on! Tundra was staked by the township, and Dia<br />Met stock, which sold for 50c. a share in mid-91, hit $67 by the end of<br />1992. Fipke and his partners were paper billionaires.<br /><br />The Ekati mine was commissioned in late 1998. Capital cost was<br />US$700 million. Sales of US$448 million (FY 2001) yielded gross<br />earnings of $285 million (!, EBITDA = earnings before interest, tax,<br />depreciation & amortization = gross profit). Mine life is expected to exceed<br />25 years.<br /><br />District exploration costs (1989-98, Ekati-Diavik district, all companies)<br />exceeded US$500 million(!). A second mine, Diavik (Rio Tinto-Aber),<br />inconveniently located directly under Lac de Gras, is scheduled to go<br />into production in 2003 at an estimated capital cost of US$885 million.<br />Serious money is involved here. [Financial data from BHP 2001<br />annual report, and various web reports. Don't expect much financial<br />information in the book. Google is your friend.<br /><br />Fipke & his longtime partner, geologist Stewart Blusson, each retain a<br />10%(!!) interest in the Ekati mine. (Blusson later gave $50 million to<br />UBC, his alma mater). When the big bucks rolled in, Fipke's marriage<br />fell apart, his brother sued him (as did many others), and his son<br />stopped speaking to him. The Big Strike had its costs.<br /><br />The book's meandering start might put you off, but don't be<br />discouraged -- Krajick has a fine story to tell, and once he gets rolling,<br />this is strong stuff. No geologist who's worked in exploration -- or<br />anyone with a taste for an old-fashioned strike-it-rich story -- should<br />miss this one .<br /><br />Happy reading,<br />Peter D.

I finished it, but just barely.<br /><br />BT opens pretty well, with an oddball first expedition to Alpha Centauri based partly on an Iroquois legend. The sfnal premises are laughably wrong-headed -- the stuff of bad TV shows -- but I kept reading, thinking Levinson had something else in mind. Perhaps he did, but the story kept twisting and turning -- odd enough to keep me reading, but not coherent enough to gel. About the only real virtue in BT is that it is short.<br /><br />Some readers did like it -- the Amazon reviews are split between the 4-5 stars and the 1-2's...<br /><br />This book clearly wasn't aimed at me. It's not even a very interesting failure. I won't be eager to read another Levinson novel. Caveat lector.<br /><br />Next time I'll try to remember to check the reviews first.

By far the most interesting story-strand is set<br />on the planet Mingulay, in a complex society of humans, saurs, krakens<br />and other sentients. The worldbuilding and backstory unfold very,<br />very nicely here, in ways that would be unfair to reveal -- much of<br />what's best in CK lies here, and I'll bet you'll have as much fun<br />reading it as I did.<br /><br />By contrast, the near-future alternate Earth, featuring a Red Europe<br />and a reactionary America, gets off to a slow start, and is likely to<br />irritate nonpolitical readers. But this stuff is at least intelligently<br />done, skimmable, and -- about 50 pages in -- finally starts to rock. But<br />I would have liked to have spent more time on Mindulay, the Second<br />Sphere, saur society, kraken ways -- and, I imagine, more of this will<br />be Coming Soon.<br /><br />I don't think I'm giving away too much by saying that Cosmonaut<br />Keep is a variant of the old Elder Races Rule the Universe shtick -- in<br />this one, Fermi's Paradox is enforced by stern Galactic Gatekeepers,<br />and woe to junior races who run afoul of the gods. They *hate* spam<br />-- and care about due process about as much as you do when you<br />spray Raid on an anthill....<br /><br />Ah, here's a quote I can't resist, from Thomas Wright, the discoverer<br />of galaxies, written c. 1750 (courtesy of Freeman Dyson):<br />\\"In this great celestial creation, the catastrophe of a world such as<br />ours, or even the total dissolution of a system of worlds, may possibly<br />be no more to the great Author of Nature than the most common<br />accident of life with us. And in all probability such final and general<br />doomsdays may be as frequent there as even Birthdays or Mortality<br />with us upon the Earth. This idea has something so Cheerful in it<br />that I own I can never look upon the stars without wondering that<br />the whole world does not become astronomers...\\"<br />If this didn't influence MacLeod in writing Cosmonaut Keep -- well,<br />it should have!<br /><br />Other readers see Poul Anderson influences in CK -- what I saw were<br />David Brin touches, and explicit references to Hans Moravec<br />who, come to think of it, was a major inspiration for the AI Wars in<br />MacLeod's first four novels.

A stirring saga of science, Mars, and life, marred by a<br />weak ending, but well-worth your attention.<br /><br />Paul McAuley's usual topics and tropisms are well-employed in<br />this new biotech SF-thriller. In 2026 a Martian microbe, secretly<br />brought back to Earth by a Chinese expedition, is accidentally<br />released into the Pacific during an attempt to steal a sample by<br />Cytex, a powerful but unscrupulous American biotech firm. The<br />Mars-bug thrives, and grows into strange floating islands, which<br />shed 'slicks' that kill terrestrial marine life. The descriptions of<br />this strange alien invader are reminiscent of  Ian McDonald's<br />wonderful _Chaga_, with a nod to H.G. Wells' _War of the<br />Worlds_.  I'm not fully-qualified to judge McCauley's biologic<br />premise (and MacGuffin), which it wouldn't be fair to reveal, but<br />he's done his homework -- I'm weaselling here because of a<br />research lapse I'll mention a bit later, but rest assured his premise<br />is just fine for fiction. Is there a biologist in the house?<br /><br />The Americans send an expedition of their own to Mars, hoping<br />to duplicate the Chinese discovery. The expedition scientists<br />include Mariella Anders, our protagonist and a biological genius<br />on the level of a Feynman or an Einstein. Like most geniuses<br />(genii?), she is unconventional: Mariella's foibles include body-<br />piercing, soft drugs, and rough sex. This last is used for blackmail<br />by Penn Brown, an odious Cytex scientist also on the Mars<br />expedition.<br /><br />Mariella is a high point of the book, and McCauley's best<br />character yet, I think. The descriptions of her scientific education<br />and career are full of neat observations and insights -- McAuley is<br />himself a former research scientist -- and her portrayal as a<br />Feynman-level genius is wonderful. A gen-Z greenpunk<br />biogenius -- all right!<br /><br />The Martian scenes -- about half of the book -- are very fine,<br />strongly reminescent of Kim Stanley Robinson's RGB Mars<br />trilogy:  impeccable (I hope) research and extrapolation, poetic<br />descriptions of alien landscapes, palpable excitement in exploring<br />a new world -- and a sadly-realistic portrait of the techno-squalor<br />around the Martian settlements, comparable to Swanwick's gritty<br />(and great) \\"Griffins Egg\\".<br /><br />When Mariella returns to Earth, on the run with stolen samples<br />of the 'Chi', the Martian superbug, the story becomes a more<br />conventional -- and less interesting -- pursuit-thriller. I lost track<br />of the cardboard villains and bit-players (I fell asleep), and I'm not<br />interested enough to go back and sort them out. The dramatic<br />'climax' is just silly -- Mariella the greenpunk genius as a<br />charismatic crowd-pleaser at a big bioscience conference -- well,<br />my dears, you've been warned, it ain't the high point of the book.<br />McAuley makes a few other stumbles, notably in his Southern<br />Arizona scenes, where he misplaces a mountain range by a<br />hundred miles [note 1]. And the authorities seem curiously<br />unconcerned about the rapidly-multiplying Martian 'slicks', even<br />as they're ruining fisheries and alarming voters.<br /><br />The bottom line: _The Secret of Life_ tackles big, meaty issues,<br />it's well-written, and it's fun to read. Even though it's not<br />completely successful, I'd say it's pretty much a must-read for<br />hard-SF and McCauley fans.<br />________<br />Note  1) -- illustrating the danger of using a setting the author<br />doesn't know well, when he encounters a reader/reviewer who<br />lives in that setting. This lapse will pass unnoticed by most<br />readers, but makes me uncomfortable about the quality of his<br />research in areas I don't know as well. Not that I read SF to learn<br />science (or geography), but McAuley has a reputation for playing<br />the hard-SF game with the net up.... And I do hope the many<br />mangled place-names are corrected in the US edition.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D. Tillman<br />(review written 4-2001)..

Short & sweet, fast & funny, but with an appalling<br />protagonist and a weak, pat ending. Even so, highly recommended.<br />This isn't a preview-type review.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />You really shouldn't read past here if you haven't read the book. And much of what follows won't make sense if you do.<br />**SPOILERS FOLLOW**<br /><br />MacLeod's \\"True Knowledge\\", his central anarcho-socialist idea, is,<br />well -- \\"Might Makes Right\\". Ugh.<br /><br />I've always thought the best way<br />to judge a person's character is to watch how they treat someone<br />who has no power over them -- think back to good & bad bosses<br />you've had. Fortunately, the \\"comrades\\" don't seem to apply this<br />principle in their everyday lives. But the protagonist, Ellen May<br />Ngewthu, is an appalling individual-- think of Gen. Curtis<br />\\"Bomb 'em back to the Stone Age\\" LeMay. Unlike LeMay, she has<br />the freedom to act, and completely destroys the \\"post-human\\"<br />Jovian civilization for the offense of hijacking a third-party<br />spaceship. Even the crudest SF carnography trots out a stronger casus<br />belli to trigger mass genocide (at least for human aggressors).<br />Ellen has a remarkable ability to dehumanize her opponents --<br />bluntly, she's a violently paranoid racist. Even after personal contact<br />with legally-human \\"robots\\" on New Mars has, kind of sort of, made<br />her accept them as \\"part of *us*, whereas the Jovians....<br /><br />  'You mean you would contemplate a union -- with *them*?' ...\\"<br /><br />\\"... Time for Plan B,\\" Ellen decides, disregarding a direct order<br />from the Solar Council -- Plan B being genocide by comet<br />bombardment. Worked, too. And the Jovies *were* baddies, through<br />& through, in the pat, weak & rather disappointing ending. Feh.<br /><br />Post-socialism (or anarcho-socialism) in MacLeod's Solar Union<br />adopts the form, but little content, from present-day socialism and<br />communism -- irony? (At least, I hope the character who says that<br />Lenin was \\"just misunderstood\\" is intended as irony.) The Union<br />economy isn't described in enough detail to judge whether it might<br />actually work (though with enough to succeed as a fictional device).<br />Perhaps there's more detail elsewhere -- this is the first MacLeod<br />book I've read (but it won't be the last).<br /><br />MacLeod has clearly read his Vinge -- though, curiously, the Union's<br />policy is to avoid a Vingean singularity at almost any cost, and to<br />destroy any culture that reaches it. For a more convincing (IMO)<br />snapshot of a successful democratic anarchy, read Vinge's \\"The<br />Ungoverned.\\" Another sfnal predecessor that likely influenced<br />MacLeod is Ursula K. LeGuin's wonderful \\"The Dispossessed\\" and<br />related works. And read Hans Moravec's recent \\"Robots\\" for another<br />view of the coming post-human era.<br /><br />Humans as aliens:  the MacLeod future history has encountered no<br />aliens, so they've made their own -- the \\"fast folk\\" or post-humans<br />are the most dramatic example, but all three societies here -- the<br />post-socialists, the anarcho-capitalists and the fast folk -- are quite<br />different from today's cultures, and quite strange to each other, a<br />welcome relief from the more usual \\"futures\\" that are today with<br />spaceships stuck in. And it's a pleasure to read a lean, non-bloated<br />novel.<br /><br />Not that there aren't some future-anachronisms here: helicopters,<br />elevator attendants(!), brass-&-steel(!) mechanical computers....<br />Memo to MacLeod: brush up on your Drexlerian molecular rod-logic<br />nanocomputers. Or if those won't work -- DNA-based<br />biocomputation. Or if you *have* to go macro-mechanical, you'd<br />use lightweight composites & light metals -- inertia in the gear<br />trains, y'know? And anyway -- how likely is it that non-networked<br />electronic computers would be crippled -- or taken over -- by \\"radio<br />viruses\\" from Jupiter?<br /><br />Tin Ear Dept: \\".... I weren't that worried. Had you lot figured.... Just<br />gosh-darn lucky....\\" (p. 168, US hc ed). Umm. Maybe this rancher<br />emigrated to Texas from the lil ol' UK?<br /><br />Enough of this grumbling & nit-picking -- I had a great time reading<br />\\"Cassini Division\\", which you might not have guessed, I just<br />realized, from reading this far.

As I just rediscovered -- my copy (with an evocative Josh Kirby cover) dates from the early 70's, and I don't recall rereading it since then. I was prompted to do so by a recent reread of  her stunning &#34;Semley's Necklace&#34; (1964), another story in Le Guin's Hainish universe, which she recycled as the prologue to Rocannon's World.<br /><br />While Planet of Exile doesn't have the depth or complexity of her best work, this is a grand, mythic story of  love and death; fear of the stranger, and the sad consequences; a bitter battle to save one's home; the joys and ashes of victory. And the grey, grinding cold of Great Winter: 5,000-some days of darkness, cold and ice (UKL does winters really well). Strong stuff. My God, this was her apprentice work!<br /><br />The rest of Rocannon's World, after &#34;Semley's Necklace&#34;, isn't up to Rocannon's World, but is very readable. I haven't reread City of Illusions recently, but recall enjoying it way back then.<br /><br />The review you should read is Jo Walton's -- link at first comment. One of her better ones.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D. Tillman	2003-12-29

Robie seems to offer<br />her only chance of surviving her ordeal, in a future that's grown<br />warmer, darker, meaner....<br /><br />This is a book that worked really well while I was reading it, but won't<br />stand up to much post-reading poking-about. In particular, hero Robie<br />is just too omni-competent to be real. But superman power-fantasies are<br />an honorable SF tradition, and Nocturne is  a fine and absorbing<br />entertainment.

It<br />wasn't racial superiority, as the Victorians thought - indeed, Diamond<br />gives evidence that the average New Guinean may well be smarter<br />than the average Westerner.  His own one-sentence summary of the<br />book is:  \\"History followed different courses for different peoples<br />because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of<br />biological differences among the peoples themselves\\"[clunk]. Or, it's the<br />environment, stupid.  Or, the West got lucky.<br /><br />I'm uncomfortable with history-as-polemics, but Diamond (usually)<br />keeps his facts and interpretations pretty well separated.  And this is a<br />wonderful one-volume history of the human race.  It is unusual, and<br />refreshing, to read a history written by a distinguished and literate<br />biological scientist.  History isn't generally considered to be science -<br />\\"it's just one damn thing after another.\\"  But then, you could say the<br />same for large parts of astronomy, biology & geology.<br /><br />13,000 years ago, the most recent Ice Age was ending, and people<br />everywhere still made their living as hunter-gatherers.  Diamond starts<br />his story at the dawn of civilization.  By Chapter 3, he's recounting<br />Pizarro's conquest of the Inca empire in 1532.  In an afternoon, 168<br />Spanish soldiers routed an army of 80,000, killed 7,000, and captured<br />the Inca emperor.  It's not surprising that the Spaniards would feel<br />superior.  But the conquistadores' invisible allies had been at work<br />since 1492 - smallpox from Spain had killed the previous Inca emperor<br />and his heir, setting off a war of succession that fatally weakened the<br />empire.  Diseases from Europe would ultimately kill up to 95% of the<br />native peoples of the Americas, often before they saw their first<br />European.  The old American cultures were doomed from first contact,<br />even if the Old World visitors had been peaceful explorers and traders.<br />12,000 years of isolation had left native Americans with no resistance to<br />the lethal European microbes.<br /><br />Where did these diseases come from, and why didn't the Indians<br />return the favor by infecting Eurasia?  Many came originally from<br />domestic animals (for example, measles and smallpox from cattle), and<br />required large, dense populations to evolve.  The Indians had few<br />domestic animals - one reason why they were poorer than Eurasians,<br />and those (fortuitously) had no diseases that \\"made the jump\\" from<br />animals to humans - good evidence for Diamond's \\"history as luck\\"<br />hypothesis.<br /><br />Diamond's history is wonderful, full of new science, strange facts, and<br />great anecdotes.

And I do mean *short* -- the longest story<br />here is 28 pages, and the average length is 16. All were first published<br />in 1990-92, when Egan was making his reputation. If you read the<br />Dozois Year's Best, you've seen \\"The Caress\\", in which a leopard-<br />woman chimera is created by a millionaire with way too much time<br />on his hands, to \\"realize\\"the eponymous, & famous, 1896 Belgian<br />Symbolist painting -- Egan's harried policeman-protagonist is drafted<br />to play the male caressor. This was his sixth(!)-published story, and it<br />has many of his trademarks: more good ideas than most novels, an<br />understated future-Australia setting, clean, transparent prose and a<br />helluva story.<br /><br />Well -- I could rattle on about individual stories, but in my usual<br />slothful fashion I'll refer you to others who've already done so --<br />personally, I don't find 2-3 line summaries of short stories to be<br />helpful (but YMMV). What I *can* say is, you'll find all of the<br />virtues of Egan's novels here, and few of the faults. There's really<br />not a weak story in the bunch. You can sample the excellent<br />scientific-romance \\"Closer\\", and \\"The Moral Virologist\\", a rather<br />loathsome Tiptree-inspired (\\"Last Flight of Dr. Ahn\\"/ \\"Screwfly<br />Solution\\") piece (plus some later stories) at Egan's website.

Humanity has spread thru much of the galaxy, but<br />interstellar contact is limited to sublight ships.  There are dreadful<br />Chenzeme war machines loose, still fighting the war which destroyed<br />that species long ago.  Much of humanity lives in the Hallowed Vasties<br />- huge Dyson-spheres.  Nanotechnology permeates everyday life, and<br />permits people to live for centuries.<br /><br />The novel is set on Silk, a sealed habitat atop a space elevator on the<br />strange & isolated world of  Deception Well.  Silk was resettled by<br />refugees from Heyertori, a world sterilized by a rogue Chenzeme swan<br />burster.  The city was deserted when they arrived, but full of human<br />bones.  The refugees thought the Old Silken were killed by a plague<br />from the planet.  They sealed off the beanstalk and live in comfort, but<br />supplies are running low & they have no way to leave - they were<br />dumped after a contract dispute with their sentient greatship.<br />Silk is attacked by followers of the prophet Jupiter, who believe they<br />can attain ecstatic Communion on the planet's surface.  Many of the<br />cultists are killed, apparently including Jupiter.  His son Lot survives,<br />and the surface of the novel is Lot's struggle to accept his father's<br />legacy, and to discover the true nature of the Deception Well.<br /><br />The novel is a fine combination of top-notch tech-speculation and<br />traditional storytelling.  It has a couple of sags that could have been cut,<br />but I'm nitpicking.  If you haven't yet tried Linda Nagata, \\"Deception<br />Well\\" would be an excellent place to start.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D. Tillman	2003-12-27

Then<br />Communist Party officials simply denied the problem, and<br />concocted elaborate coverups -- even painting the tree<br />trunks to hide that the bark had been eaten by starving<br />people -- when Mao or senior officials were to visit famine<br />areas.

The three items in the title are Dyson's hope for<br />generating wealth in the world's poor villages: the sun for cheap<br />solar power, the Net to end rural isolation, and genetic engineering<br />for better crop plants. For example, he presents the hope of<br />engineering \\"trees that convert sunlight to liquid fuel and deliver<br />the fuel directly ...to underground pipelines.\\" A neat solution to<br />declining oil reserves, if it works. Dyson cheerfully admits his<br />record as a prophet is mixed, but \\"it is better to be wrong than to be<br />vague.\\"<br /><br />Fresh and unexpected insights are a frequent pleasure in this<br />(and other) Dyson books. For instance, he describes his<br />mother and aunts, prosperous British matrons all, who, in the<br />interval between the World Wars, accomplished such things as<br />opening a birth-control clinic, managing a large hospital, winning<br />an Olympic medal, and pioneering aviation in Africa -- \\"it was<br />considered normal at the time for middle-class women to do<br />something spectacular.\\" They were able to do this only with the<br />support of a large servant class. The introduction of labor-saving<br />appliances helped to emancipate the servants, but left middle-class<br />women less free than before, a general pattern, says Dyson: \\"the<br />burdens of equalization fall disproportionately on women.\\"<br /><br />Dyson is a lifelong space enthusiast, though things haven't gone<br />that well lately for space fans: \\"we look at the bewildered<br />cosmonauts struggling to survive in the Mir space station.<br />Obviously they are not going anywhere except, if they are lucky,<br />down.\\" But in the long term, prospects are brighter, and await<br />finding a cheap way up and out of the gravity well (another<br />enduring Dyson insight). He reports recent successful tests of<br />a laser-launcher and a \\"ram accelerator\\", the latter a proposed 750-<br />foot gas-gun -- and a direct descendent of Jules Verne's cannon-<br />launched spacecraft in \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\"(1865). As in<br />all cheap launch methods, the trick is to keep the fuel on the<br />ground, not in the spacecraft. With cheap spacefight, people will<br />spread out into the solar system and beyond. Why? \\"Because it is<br />there\\" -- some folks just have itchy feet. Others will belong to<br />unpopular religions, or be on the run, or... any of the countless<br />other things that have always motivated emigrants.<br /><br />Dyson, unusually for a theoretician, has always been more \\"tinker<br />than thinker\\". He cites Thomas Kuhn's classic _Structure of<br />Scientific Revolutions_ (1962, rev. ed. 1970) as an example of a<br /><br />fellow-physicist with the opposite bent, emphasizing ideas over<br />things. Of course, both are important;  but some of Kuhn's followers<br />put forward the idea that science is about power struggles, not new<br />ideas. Dyson once upbraided Kuhn about this at a conference. Kuhn<br />reacted angrily: \\"One thing you have to understand. I am not a<br />Kuhnian!\\"<br /><br />Freeman Dyson is my favorite scientist-writer. I know of no one<br />else who combines his clarity of thought, graceful use of language,<br />big ideas expressed modestly, and sense of history. If you haven't yet<br />read Dyson, _The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet_ would be a<br />fine place to start. Highly recommended.<br />  He is an emeritus professor<br />at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University<br /> and the author of many other books.<br />I would particularly recommend _Disturbing the Universe_ (1979)<br />and _Infinite in All Directions_ (1989), both among the very best<br />books ever written about science and its place in history, public<br />policy, and the exploration of space...<br /><br />Review copyright 1999 Peter D.

But<br />you can't keep a good  entrepreneur down, and with an unwitting<br />grubstake from a wealthy, right-wing SF author -- the galactics find<br />his human-supremacist novels a hoot -- he introduces the Mukerjii<br />Drink Valet: an improved drink-bulb for zero-gee travel. It's a hit<br />with the alien tourists, but there are *trillions* of potential customers<br />out there -- so it's off to the Carina Arm Travel Accessories Trade<br />Show, once Mukerjii surmounts the minor difficulty of raising $85<br />million for starfare, registration and travel expenses....<br /><br />One of many nice touches is the rate-of-exchange disparity: one<br />gozashtandu is worth about US$5,000, so power, air, gravity &<br />radiation shielding for Mukerjii's booth will set him back 6500 gosh,<br />or a cool $32 million American.<br /><br />But -- to a galactic, a gosh is a negligible sum, so he can<br />retail the Drink Valet, which costs maybe a quarter to manufacture,<br />for $5,000 apiece!

Thorne, the Feynman Professor of Physics at Caltech &lt;[...]> is best known to the general public for his 1988 wormhole \\"time machine\\" proposal, and indeed much of the book is taken up exploring the question, \\"is time travel possible?\\"<br /><br />Physicist Richard Price leads off with a concise refresher-essay, \\"Welcome to Spacetime.\\" Danish physicist Igor Novikov explores classic time-travel paradoxes, with some cool diagrams and novel results: in essence, \\"closed timelike curves\\" [note 2] are theoretically possible, but paradoxes aren't allowed -- with a time-machine, you could visit your grandfather, but you couldn't kill him. The universe wouldn't permit it -- which in essence is Hawking's Chronology Protection conjecture. Hawking speculates that the unfortunate time-traveler would be incinerated by (literally) a bolt from the blue. Well, what he actually says is, \\"one would expect the  energy-momentum tensor to be infinite on the Cauchy horizon\\" [note 3], which (sigh) is a pretty typical Hawking attempt at \\"popular\\" science.<br /><br />Fortunately, Thorne himself is a master popularizer, and he ends up explaining Hawking's ideas as well as his own. His essay amounts to an update chapter for his wonderful 1994 book, Black Holes & Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy, which I enthusiastically recommend: &lt;[...]>. Thorne reluctantly concludes that things really don't look very good for wormholes, especially for time travel -- though he does leave a tiny ray of hope for some super-advanced future civilization to make wormholes for space travel [note 4]. Thorne notes that our grasp of basic physics is so crude that we can really only understand maybe 5% of the stuff that fills our universe -- the \\"normal\\" baryonic matter that makes up people, planets and stars. Thorne guesses that 35% of the universes's mass is in some unknown form of \\"cold dark matter\\", and the remaining 60% is some even more mysterious form of \\"dark energy\\" -- so there's certainly plenty of room left for discovery!<br /><br />The book concludes with a nice explanation of why good popular-science books are needed, by noted pop-science writer Timothy Ferris, and with Alan Lightman's essay on \\"The Physicist as Novelist\\".  Lightman, a former student of Thorne's, went on to write Einstein's Dreams and other well-regarded novels.<br /><br />The Future of Spacetime is written for a general audience -- aside from Hawking's essay, everything should be understandable to any science-literate reader. I particularly recommend it to readers who've liked Thorne's earlier pop-science works.<br />______________________<br /><br />Note 1). a clever play on festschrift, the traditional name for such a tribute volume.<br /><br />Note 2). As Hawking cheerfully points out, \\"closed timelike curve\\" is just physics-speak for time travel, because you can't admit you're studying that sci-fi stuff in a grant proposal...<br /><br />Note 3). Arthur C. Clarke notes that \\"the most convincing argument against time travel is the remarkable scarcity of time travellers...\\"<br /><br />Note 4). As you may know, a faster-than-light spaceship could also be used as a time-machine, another reason why most physicists think FTL travel is very unlikely.

RED THUNDER is his tribute to RP, and ROCKET SHIP GALILEO, and HAVE SPACESUIT, WILL TRAVEL, and all the other wonderful Heinlein juveniles that SF readers of a Certain Age cut their teeth on.<br />Anyway, as you've probably figured out by now, a bunch of likeable Florida teens get together and build a homemade spaceship, a couple decades from now -- with the help of a cashiered NASA astronaut and his idiot-savant cousin, Jubal, who's discovered a vacuum-energy shunt. With free, unlimited energy, just about anything can fly, even a spaceship made of used railroad tank-cars...<br /><br />OK, the framing plot doesn't bear close inspection, and the air kinda leaks out of the tale once Red Thunder lifts off, but for 3/4 of the book RT is GREAT, the Pure Quill, a delight to read. The kid's spaceship would work, given the One Impossible Thing that makes this SF. The other problems of spaceflight were solved long ago, and if you could fly to Mars & back in a week, you wouldn't need sophisticated life support. Watching the crew solve the practical problems of building a spaceship in their garage -- actually a large, vacant warehouse -- and on a tight budget -- makes for classic golden-age SF.<br /><br />Once they get to Mars, the story turns perfunctory, as if Varley lost interest. The Chinese and American astronauts are pure cardboard. There's the obligatory Space Rescue, for high drama. There's an oddly-anachronistic bit of Red-baiting, which I found distasteful. Then the return home, to fame and riches. Eh.<br /><br />Varley's too good a writer to leave the downside of Free Energy! unexamined, and he tosses in a neat bit from Bester's THE STARS MY DESTINATION, but his solution to keeping the dirt-cheap megatons (PyrE) away from the bad guys, while it might work, reads like a UN press-release. Better to have left that to our imagination, I think. In fact, if I'd been Varley's Stern Editor, I'd have ended the novel when Red Thunder lands on Mars, and outline everything after in the Epilogue.<br /><br />Still, there's more than enough Right Stuff here to make RED THUNDER worth reading, though longtime Varley fans may find the book a bit of a letdown. Better, perhaps, to ignore the Famous Name, and enjoy the tale for what it is, a fine, flawed, nostalgic remake of a childhood classic.<br /><br />Review written 2003, minor revision 2014<br />Peter D.

In fact, she can see several worldlines at once, the better to dodge trouble. But, if she travels too far from her Mainline, she can't find her way home -- so she leads a self-contained, lonely life.<br />As the story unfolds, Reva gets involved with a young smuggler, and tries to stay in that mainline to maintain the friendship. Complications ensue.<br />Mainline has some of the cheerful amorality of early Delany, and an interesting study of the implications of worldline-crossing in a many-worlds universe. Reva's ability is psi-based -- she is something of an adult, conflicted Telzey Amberdon. She does turn out to be an assassin with a heart of gold (gag), but it's more complex than that, thank heavens. The major good guys are well-drawn, but her villains are pretty cartoonish. The frequent POV shifts are distracting, and, like many first novelists, Christian tries to cram in too much stuff. And there's some dodgy (to be polite) economics in the world-building. But, overall, a worthy first effort and a fine, gripping story.<br />Here's a cover blurb from Nicola Griffith: It's a &quot;refreshing change to read about a woman who kills people for a living, instead of worrying about their well-being.&quot;<br />Happy reading!<br />Cheers -- Pete Tillman	2003-11-10

The Quanska (literally) ran into a human Jupiter probe, to the surprise and consternation of both races. Once communication is established, the Quanska offer a near-term fetus as a host-body for a human brain. Matt Raimey, a young quadriplegic, is recruited, and is duly reborn as a baby Quanska.<br /><br />\\"I love the central idea of Manta's Gift -- an ornery, shallow and callow human youth trades a hopeless existence as a quadriplegic for a chance to be reborn as an alien being with a (reasonably) human mind. The description of a birth from the point of view of the thing being born is... interesting. The depiction of what is a truly alien society -- in setup, in physiology, in mindset -- is well done, and is a fascinating thread to follow throughout the book. Everything is accounted for, in suitably alien ways...\\"<br /><br />-- Alma Hromic, SF Site<br /><br />Once the earthly Powers That Be twig that the Quanska aren't native to Jupiter, they want that alien stardrive -- now! Rather than trade for it, they send a goon to extort it. She opens  'negotiations' by kidnapping a bunch of Quanska children. Worse, the kids escape...<br /><br />In a fine twist, the Quanska themselves are desperate for human help with their big problem -- their introduced ecology is falling apart. And there's a catch to their 'stardrive', too.<br /><br />The crisp dialog and hardball power-politics remind me of prime-period Resnick (eg. SANTIAGO). On the downside, the Quanska Big Secret is, well, incredible. Fortunately, it's revealed late, and the book has other virtues. But it's sloppy and dumb [note 1, *SPOILERS*].<br /><br />\\"As usual, he draws his characters simply-there is a distinct tendency to caricature-and often poses them rather stiffly on the stage.

The MSS \\"River of Stars\\", the grandest of the great magsail liners, was launched in 2051. But the new Farnsworth fusion thrusters rang the death-knell for the magsails, and the now-obsolete liner was converted to fusion power in 2084. Two decades later, she has become a tramp freighter, bound for Dinwoody Poke, Jupiter space, on what will be her final voyage....<br /><br />The Middle System -- Mars, the Belt, Jupiter space -- has not developed tidily, and the crew is made up of casualties of the great 21st-century space boom. RIVER is their story.<br /><br />RIVER is a tour de force of character developement. We watch, riveted, as these motley misfits squabble, beef and try to cope, in the hermetic isolation of a ship becalmed in space -- two of the four Farnsworth engines have been ruined in a freak accident. The ship has 19 days to rebuild the engines, or she will pass the balk line, the point of no return, and drift endlessly away from settled space.<br /><br />The repairs go slowly, but the ship's Engineer is a master of improvisation, and no one doubts he will fix the engines in time. No one, that is, but the oldest magsailors, who remember that the RIVER still has her old sails, unused for decades. They decide to fix them up, just in case. No one likes, or trusts, the acting captain, so they don't tell him (or the Engineer) their plan -- which has a large share of nostalgia for the lost Age of Sail.  And there isn't enough superconducting hobartium on board to repair both engines and sails....<br /><br />RIVER is a classical tragedy. Hubris, small mistakes, misunderstandings, mishaps and personal conflicts collide, echo and feed back in a downward spiral that will ultimately wreck the great ship. It wouldn't be fair to reveal the ending, but it's not a happy one. There are no real villains here, just flawed people trying to cope, at times heroically. But the Fates are not on their side.<br /><br />Flynn tells his story in the third-person omniscient, with dry asides as he develops his characters. The omniscient narrator is the Greek chorus to the inevitable tragedy, which develops with an awful majesty. Flynn's writing is masterful. His pacing is grave, controlled, ironic. His characters will break your heart as they work, love, fight, grow, grieve and die. This is a wonderful book, easily Flynn's best. RIVER is set in the future of Flynn's popular near-future \\"Star\\" tetrology (also recommended), but is a standalone novel. This is the best hard-SF tragic novel of character yet written (though this is an uncrowded niche). And the cover art, by Stephan Martiniere, is just flat gorgeous.

Fortunately, he'd backed up<br />three days earlier.  It doesn't take Albert long to find Lisa, a sexy predator<br />who taps her lovers' accounts & sucks them dry.  But the host computer<br />has strong civil rights written into its basic code.  And Lisa has an outside<br />line to a disgruntled employee of the parent company...<br /><br />\\"Silicon Karma\\" moves right along.  Characters and dialog ring true<br />(barring the odd clunk) but it's basically a novel of ideas.  Good ideas,<br />well-thought-out ideas, a steady stream of ideas.  Easton works out the<br />details of daily life inside a host computer, including competition (fair<br />& foul) for the limited resources of the host.  Artificial-life ecologies are a<br />hot topic in computational science, and Easton's biology background<br />allows some fresh insights.<br /><br />Dr. Easton, a biology professor at Thomas College in Maine, is Analog's<br />long-time book reviewer.  His previous  \\"Organic Future\\" novels were<br />interesting but (IMO) marred by implausibilities and excessive cuteness<br />(eg \\"roachsters\\" for cars).  \\"Silicon Karma\\" is a step up for Easton as a<br />novelist, and I hope he returns to this future.<br /><br />Review copyright 1999 Peter D.

The white man is about to discover America....<br /><br />Bottom line: Steve Stirling's writing just keeps getting better. This parallel-world thriller incorporates the best features of his popular Draka and Island in the Sea of Time series. Enthusiastically recommended.<br /><br />1946: John Rolfe, recuperating from his war wounds,is tinkering with a war-surplus shortwave radio. !!CRACK!! The end of his basement is GONE, replaced with a sheet of rippling silver....<br /><br />2009: Tom Christiansen, game warden, is on a bust of wildlife-smugglers. The smuggler's warehouse is destroyed by incendiaries, but he find a fresh-killed man -- and a fresh-killed *dodo*....<br /><br />And Steve Stirling is off and running with another of his patented reinventions of SF/F classics, here the 'virgin world next door.' As always, his research is deep, and impeccable. Details matter. His major characters come alive, and the minor ones carry their spears smoothly.<br /><br />The structure of the book is a police-procedural in 2009 -- Christiansen & a buddy work through an increasingly-weird wildlife-parts smuggling case -- with explanatory flashbacks in \\"New Virginia\\", as John Rolfe has tagged his virgin California. Once the wardens have twigged to the Rolfes' secret, they're abducted to New VA, and the book morphs to a political thriller -- Draka-like Elements are intent on subverting the (mostly) benevolent oligarchy that rules the new New World. One of the strengths of Conquistador is that all sides are drawn warts and all -- no shining heroes or dastardly villains here (well, a couple of the latter) -- just people playing with the hands they're dealt. And the new New World is a fabulous wish-fulfillment fantasy, that almost everyone who's gotten a bellyful of the downside of civilization has had -- but here worked out thoughtfully and carefully. Very nice.<br /><br />So, are there warts on this terrific book? Pretty minor ones: the secret-gate-between-worlds shtick is overdone. The food is better than I'd expect in white-boy heaven -- compare the Canadian/Northern US 'land of the bland', and the big, bland, indifferently-prepared meals in old White South Africa, to the lovingly-described feasts in New Virginia.... OK, so I'm reaching for something to complain about. This is Stirling's best-written book yet. It's (probably) #1 of a series, but comes to a stirring resolution, with a wonderful trick teaser for the next. If you've liked previous Stirling books, you'll love this one. And if you've put off trying him -- wait no longer. This is a winner.<br /><br />Here are some author comments, from Usenet:<br />\\"I've had CONQUISTADOR bubbling at the back of my mind for a long time; since the early 80's, in fact.<br />It's a different book than it would have been if I'd written it then, of course; I like to think my technique has improved, and I've mellowed out a bit.<br />On the other hand, it's also not quite the same book that I would have written if the idea for it had come to me recently.  Large chunks have been 'around' since its genesis.<br />That made writing it an interesting experience; sort of like a collaboration with myself.\\"<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />[Conquistador] \\"right now it's a standalone, although there's potential for sequels.<br />I'm planning on a couple of alternate-history space-and-planet operas next, though, involving alien-induced differences in the solar system which only become known on earth in the early 1960's.\\"<br /><br />Review copyright 2003 by Peter D.

I'll make no attempt to avoid **SPOILERS** in the following.<br /><br />In a future, post-apocalyptic Britain, wrecked by gang-wars, a band of irregulars led by a female Lieutenant hole up in an old castle. They make the Lord and his mistress into half-prisoners, half-pets. The Lord has endless, pointless, boring, amazingly windy memories/internal monologues of what went before. He (strict first person) addresses the memoir to Her, in second person, which works about as well as this usually does, which is to say, a weak, poor and distracting device. Did I mention the brutal, pointless killings, there to demonstrate that post-apocalyptic Gangwar is Hell?<br /><br />The Loot and her soldiers slaughter a rival gang, and take their Big Gun. This is symbolic. The soldiers have a big victory party, get drunk, rape the girls, wreck the Lord's castle, and humiliate him. The Loot has sex with Her Mistresship, a mute, milquetoast boring cardboard 'person'. The Loot shoots the Lord, but he gets away, and (sort of) kills her. Her troops tie him to the Big Gun: in the Lord's words, &quot;For I too am tied, in Mezentian hyperbole, a puppet of [sic] before the cannon's mouth.&quot; You know, a little Mezentian hyperbole goes a long, long way, but it's here by the hundredweight, page after page after page... &quot;It is my estimation that, unless one's involvement is peripheral, nobody survives a war; the people who come out the other side are not those who went in.&quot; Good God.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this sad, purple, preachy, windy book book was written by our beloved, Orbital-smashing, Drone-riding Iain M. Banks -- but I've had pretty poor luck with his non-SF novels. There was a violently-nihilistic spy thriller (Complicity??) that I liked pretty well, but I found The Bridge dull and tendentious, and now this.<br /><br />So I guess I'll stick to the Star Smashers of Special Circumstances, thank you very much, and leave the literary stuff to, well, the literariate?<br /><br />If you'd like a *good* book about post-apocalyptic Britain with castles and gang-wars (kinda), I recommend Edward P. Hughes' fine, underrated Master of the Fist , which will run rings around this sorry POS.

The<br />setup is familiar: hi-tech immortal humans (the Powers) are lording it<br />over lo-tech tribesmen. Here, the immortal Powers are, well, really,<br />*really* powerful (see Zelazny), but bored, so a few of them went<br />looking for a lost colony as a lark. They found the colonists, liked<br />their world, and some of them found out they liked being Gods. But<br />mostly they relaxed into a nice, slow, 400-year vacation. Until one of<br />the oldest, meanest, weirdest immortals decides he'd really like to rule<br />a galactic empire...<br /><br />Fortunately the old weirdo is pretty dumb, and is brought to heel by a<br />plucky tribesman and a sneaky immortal. One could quibble with some of<br />the story logic, but that seems pointless in a book that so nicely<br />accomplishes its goal of entertaining the reader for a few hours.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like Norton & Zelazny, you should look for DW.<br />Recommended.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

US	52438789	R4AYAL2Q4QJNN	0446601667	729250187	When Heaven Fell	Books	4	7	7	N	N	4.5 stars: grim but fascinating alien invasion	WHF is one of the few SF novels to consider what would happen if hostile aliens *really* invaded Earth, which is to say it would be like 16th century Aztec warriors vs. the 21st century US Army. Not much doubt about the outcome -- although Barton has humans inflict 600,000 casualties on the invaders, who killed 8 billion humans. So a better comparison would be Zulus vs. British, or Apaches vs. the USA: no hope of victory for 'our' side, but we're strong enough to inflict casualties and win skirmishes. After conquest, it got nastier than any of these examples -- the Congo under King Leopold comes to mind. This is not a cheerful book.<br /><br />It turns out that the invaders, the Kkhruhhuft, sentient velociraptors (+/-), are mercenaries, janissaries really, conquered long ago by the Master Race. The Masters appear to be some sort of emergent AI's -- their hosts/companions/creators(?) are a group-mind made up of carnivorous, UV-loving, blue froggy 'poppits'. The Masters' taste for galactic conquest is inexplicable, but they're very good at it. Evil Overlords, yes, but inscrutable, *alien* EO's. Perhaps conquering planets is how they keep score.<br /><br />Rigorously-selected humans can join the Masters' janissary armies. Since Earth's civilization has been smashed, volunteers aren't hard to find. The viewpont character is a successful merc officer, coming home on leave for the first time since his enlistment<br /><br />These are pretty pampered mercs. Between mass-killing campaigns, they live in comfortable bases on nice planets. The officers have personal servants, cooks, sexual consorts -- Athy has three burdar bedservants, a cook and a batman. The burdars enlist for a fixed term, are payed well and get a sizeable bonus for completing their enlistment -- they will return home rich, by local standards. There's a queasy fascination to this, and to the whole setup. The mercs try to maintain good training and discipline, but are under no illusions as to their role, which is brutal conquest and enforcement of Master rule. This usually involves smashing the local civilization, and killing 99% of the planet's population.<br /><br />The book is matter-of-fact throughout, and is less depressing than it sounds. Life does go on, through the most awful circumstances, and people cope as best they can (or die). There's even a thread of hope that the Evil Overlords will someday get their comeuppance. The bad news is, the conquered races are likely to be exterminated too...<br /><br />The bottom line:  The first & second time I read WHF, I thought it was terrific. I didn't like it as much this time, but it's still a good, and unusual, book. Recommended, but not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D. Tillmancement of Master rule.

Rosa Coleman moves to Kansas to escape an abusive husband, then moves on to Alaska when the brute find out she's in Dodge City -- a town Haldeman picked, no doubt, with malice aforethought. The 'memoir' is well-researched and pretty good, but has no special sfnal frisson until Rosa is led on a galactic fantasy-tour by an Alien Guardian disguised as a Tlingit Raven shaman...<br /><br />It wouldn't be fair to reveal how Raven got involved, so let's just say that many-worlds is the law in this universe, with interesting consequences. Haldeman's writing is as good as ever (a relief after Forever Peace), and the galactic-tourist scenes with Raven and Rosa are as thrilling and strange as the encounters with the weird continuity-guardian in The Hemingway Hoax -- high praise indeed.<br /><br />The spirit-guardian out-of-body trip leader was a pretty common conceit in 19th century proto-sf, and Haldeman specifically identifies a Flammarion novel as a parallel work to his. A somewhat similar book, that ordinary readers may have actually read, is Lindsay's Voyage to Arcturus. Personally, I would have preferred more galaxy-touring and less history in Guardian, but I wasn't disappointed with the book at hand. And, at 231 pages, no great time-commitment is required. Recommended.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D. Tillman.    Note 3).  They also make more sense than those HH scenes.    Note 4).

In the mid 22nd century, humankind is taking its first steps into interstellar space. Two living worlds have been discovered in the Alpha Centauri system -- one even has sentients, the Bronze-age Troodons. A small human colony has been established on the other, dubbed Norumbega. The third starship to Centauri is damaged by a meteorite as it is decelerating towards Norumbega...<br /><br />OK, this is a pretty standard setup. Why would you want to read another first-colony, first-contact, first novel, by a guy you've never heard of, and from an off-brand publisher?<br /><br />Because this guy McSweegan is a riveting storyteller. Despite a bunch of flaws (which I'll spell out later), I read it at one sitting. This isn't the tenth or even the hundredth story I've read with this basic plot, and the pages still just flew by. I liked Alpha Transit -- now let's see if I can lay out the book so you can see if it's right for you.<br /><br />The author who first came to mind as a comparable is the late Robert Forward. McSweegan's done his technical homework. The starship technology is believable, and laid out in sufficient detail to satisfy the starry-eyed gearheads among us (me, me!). I didn't notice any serious scientific gaffes. There's nothing startlingly original here -- McSweegan's basically taken a good 50's or 60's SF story and brought it up to date. This is a substantial achievement. The price paid is that the characters and plot are, well, adequate. The utter lack of literary pretense is refreshing, and his characters are, uh, somewhat more lifelike than Forward's.<br /><br />McSweegan did a nice job with his aliens, too, who are genuinely *alien*, not just actors in Klingon suits. The alien biochemistry is interesting and plausible (McSweegan is a microbiologist). He sets things up for a sequel, but the novel comes to a satisfying resolution. He writes with the bedrock optimism that's always drawn me to the genre. He's clearly a new hard-sf writer to watch, and I'm surprised one of the 'name' SF publishers didn't pick the book up.<br /><br />Which is probably the reason for most of the caveats I'm about to deliver. Copyediting is about on the level of an old Ace pb on a bad day, and no real editor was involved. The book, though nicely printed and bound, is printed double-spaced with large type. This might actually be a desirable feature for aging eyes, but is distracting and looks amateurish. Too many characters talk about 20th-century culture. There are too many characters, period. The tone of the book can be almost painfully earnest...<br /><br />But, you know what? None of this stuff really matters, 'cause the story grabs you by the neck and won't let go.<br /><br />And I have to admire McSweegan's grit in getting his book into print however he could. Technically-literate SF that tells a socko story is never in oversupply, so let's welcome a promising new supplier!<br /><br />Review copyright 2000 Peter D.

Turns out to be a winner. De Gramont, who appears to be twenty-something, writes spare stories about young love, cats, et la condition humaine -- set in Colorado, New York and Cape Cod, where I'm almost certain the author went to school, lived, and (definitely) lives now. Men, women and cats are all convincingly rendered in appealingly unornamented prose. Her stories have beginnings, middles and ends (hurrah!). There are touches of strange in a couple of her stories, but this is contemporary mimetic fiction, in which I am usually disappointed.<br /><br />So -- if you like good short fiction about young people and cats, give de Gramont a try. Tellingly, all her stories are original to this book, further demonstrating the parlous state of non-genre short fiction. At least two of her stories, were they sfnal, would be Hugo and/or Nebula nominees -- and, judging from my reaction, would interest other short-sf fans...<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

Duffield writes in a clear, direct style that's a pleasure to read. The book grew out of a long series of talks and lectures he's given around the Flagstaff - Grand Canyon area -- he quotes a fifth-grader who wrote a thank-you note for \\"being interesting and not boring,\\" which is a nice capsule review of _Volcanoes_.<br /><br />Although he's writing for a general audience, geologists who aren't intimately familiar with Northen Arizona will learn of some neat new discoveries -- such as the remarkable similarity between the Mt. St. Helens blowout and the Peaks' long-puzzling Inner Basin (p. 25). And that recent lava-dams on the Colorado River (near present-day Lava Falls) made lakes in Grand Canyon nearly half a mile deep!<br /><br />And anyone with working eyes will be pleased with Michael Collier's splendid aerial photos -- if you're new to Collier, you will want to seek out his beautiful, large-format _Arizona : A View from Above_, which might be the best book of artistic air photos yet published (and which, sadly, is out of print).<br /><br />Peter D.

There's always some trepidation when one begins to re-read a fondly-remembered book.  Will it hold up?  Will it be as good as I remember? Happily, Ms. Arnason's wonderful prose soon caught me once again in her spell....<br /><br />Lixia, the viewpoint character,  is a Hawaiian anthropologist from an<br />Earth still recovering from the excesses of the 20th century.  She's<br />nerving herself up to enter her first alien village at Sigma Draconis --<br />'There was no point in sneaking around.  If they caught me spying, I'd be<br />in real trouble.

The people there<br />had tried to sacrifice me to their god, the Destroyer of Cities...'<br />Nia, a woman of the Iron People, is a smith and a pervert - she once loved<br />a man.  Her neighbors drove her from their village in disgrace.  Now<br />she has a smithy near a village of the Copper People -- the village Lixia had<br />come to study.  Lixia's first contact doesn't go well -- she is driven out. Nia<br />takes her in, befriends her, and they become travel companions.  The next<br />village they visit is kinder:<br />\\"This person without fur is amazing.  She knows nothing about<br />anything.  But she is willing to listen, and she doesn't interrupt.\\"<br /><br />Lixia and Nia are joined by Dexter Seawarrior, Ph.D., an Angeleno<br />aborigine.  His people prize mellowness and truth;  Dexter is devious<br />and ambitious.

Until the mysterious Phinons attack a human ship out in the Oort cloud. And a wrecked alien ship hints at a possible FTL drive....<br /><br />Dykstra's an engaging character, as is gorgeous genano engineer Samantha \\"Sunshine\\" MacTavish. Aside from an autistic idiot-savant who loves squirrels, Kooistra's other characters are straight stock, but they carry spears adequately. I did wince at some of the dialog:<br /><br />\\"She reminds me of someone, Bob.  Someone who was very special to me.\\" Or: \\"Our duty is to survive, Luke. Not to give you a chance to be a hero.\\"<br /><br />Dykstra's War has some interesting ideas, including a new explanation for Fermi's Paradox (\\"where is everyone?\\"), inside a conventional, competently-written SF thriller. The plot moves briskly, and while there are few surprises, I had fun reading it. Recommended for fans of this sort of thing.<br /><br />This is Kooistra's first novel. Analog readers may recognize parts of a couple of 1993 stories here. Kooistra is presently a science columnist for Analog, and delights in stirring up trouble by advocating fringe-science ideas, some of which show up here.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Pete Tillman	2001-01-20

Highly recommended	Vacuum Flowers is a grand tour of the inhabited Solar System, set in a medium-term future. The book opens in Eros Kluster, one of many asteroid-based settlements that form the bulk of Human space, after all of humanity on Earth was absorbed into the Comprise, a world-wide AI- and net-mediated group-mind. The Klusters are frontier-capitalist polities, more or less, with advanced biotech and neuro-engineering -- most people spend their workday wetware-programmed by their employer, a (+/-) reversible process. There is, umm, 'potential for abuse', and Swanwick has fun exploring the consequences of this technology. For example, a police raid wouldn't require many  police -- temp-deputies could be imprinted on the spot...<br /><br />People's Mars, an unappealing collectivist state based on classical Sparta, is nonetheless making good progress terraforming Mars. The cislunar settlements, a no-man's-land between Humanity and the Comprise, are the dark anarchic Mean Streets. And the remote Dyson settlements in the Oort are bucolic biophile semi-utopias, offstage. Swanwick notes that he \\"tried to display a range of plausible governmental systems throughout the System, all of them flawed the way that governments are in the real world...\\" Nicely done, one of the highlights of Vacuum Flowers.<br /><br />Oh, and the Flowers are pretty little plants, engineered to live in the vacuum & eat garbage, that have become a weedy nuisance -- another nice touch. Swanwick is, surprisingly, one of the few SF authors who've borrowed Freeman Dyson's remarkable biotech space-settlement ideas. Dyson is an extraordinarily inventive and graceful scientist-writer, and I seldom miss a chance to recommend his books: see my review of Dyson's [[ASIN:B001CEREQ6 The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet: Tools of Scientific Revolutions (Nypl/Oup Lectures)]].<br /><br />This was Swanwick's second novel, and first really successful one. Despite some rough spots -- notably, the cyberpunkish opening --Vacuum Flowers remains an exemplary modern space-opera, one of the best in the extraordinary reinvention of my favorite subgenre during the past two decades. I've now read VF three times (1987, 1993, & 2000), and I expect to enjoy it again in 2007 or so. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

First contact is violent, and the<br />humans (who are the titular demons) soon find themselves forced to<br />take sides in a tribal war....<br /><br />This sort of thing has been done, umm, once or twice before, but<br />seldom as well as here. Flint's aliens are well thought-out and<br />biologically plausible. The tiny human colony's predicament is nicely<br />portrayed: one of the human leaders is a historian, and she is<br />painfully aware of how good intentions can lead to monstrous evil.<br /><br />There are some first-novel rough spots -- Flint's exposition is lumpy<br />and sometimes preachy -- but he's an outstanding storyteller, which<br />more than makes up for the (minor) problems. Recommended.<br /><br />Mother of Demons was Flint's first novel, and attracted little notice<br />on publication -- I'm sure sales weren't helped by Baen mislabelling<br />the book as a fantasy. His new solo novel 1632, which plops a<br />contemporary American town into Europe's Thirty Years' War, has<br />been getting good notices,which might help bring Mother of Demons<br />the larger audience it deserves.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Pete Tillman	2000-12-24

Rating: "B+"	______________________________________________<br />Ann Powers, age 36, has led an interesting life so far. She's a nice whitebread Catholic girl from Seattle who took her first acid trip at 16;  became a record-store clerk, sexual adventuress & conscientious drug-user in the Bay Area in the 80's;  and is now a pop-music journalist and bohemian sellout in New York.<br /><br />For one who played at the edge of Bohemia in the late 60's, it's fun to read about a more-serious boho of the following generation. Starting with high-school alienation (is there anyone who's gone through adolescence in America in the last 50 years who *didn't * feel alienated?), Powers falls into Bad Company -- indie rock, soft drugs and (mostly) safe sex.<br /><br />She drops out of college and moves to San Francisco, America's western Capitol of Cool since (at least) the Gilded Age. She makes friends, shares cheap apartments with wildly-assorted roomates, takes lovers, menial jobs and quite a lot of dope. In short, she was growing up and having fun, albeit in a more, umm, colorful milieu than most of us manage. It's good stuff, guaranteed to bring  nostalgia for your own misspent youth. I'm thankful to have had a much quieter coming-of-age, but it's fun to read about someone who had a harder go of it.<br /><br />Finally she gets the Big Break -- a call from the New York Times, asking her to work for them as a pop-music critic! After much agonizing -- not the least about leaving California for New York -- and a push from her boyfriend (now husband), she makes the leap to Upper Bohemia, gets married, buys a house in Brooklyn, and moans & groans about Selling Out. I'd skip over the last pretty lightly, if I were you -- \\"did I really think I could resist the temptation of moral emptiness, like some Boho Joan of Arc?\\" etc. I liked it better when Powers muses that she'd have sold out before, but no one was buying....<br /><br />Powers is most engaging when she's retelling True Stories about herself and her friends. When she drifts off into boho philosophy, I skimmed, and you may want to, too.  She does try to put her and her friends'experiences into perspective with the beats, hippies, slackers, etc. Powers takes pop music seriously (it's her livelihood), and the rock-indie-grunge stuff will be more interesting to readers who follow it (not me).  \\"Weird Like Us\\" is a nice companion piece to David Brooks' \\"Bobos in Paradise\\" (or how Bourgeois Bohemians conquered America). Prof. Brooks is more polished, and much funnier, but Ann Powers has walked the walk. Both books are essential reading for those interested in late-20th century American pop-culture.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Pete Tillmanff into boho philosophy, I skimmed, and you may want to, too.

A fine and funny tall tale	_____________________________________________<br />There's not a great deal of geological science-fiction extant, so I'm pleased to report that Bone Wars is worthy of your attention.<br /><br />Montana Territory, 1876:  Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope are both digging in the Judith River fossil beds, with no great success, and spying on each other's camps. They learn of another bone-digger, who shields his camp behind a \\"ghost wall,\\" and has found some truly magnificent dinosaur specimens. A *fourth* paleontologist appears, an odd-looking fellow who claims to be from Iceland, and wants help to save the prize bones from being shipped off to \\"Sweden\\"....<br /><br />Stir in a cowboy who's really a girl, a Sioux who's a Yale graduate, a deserter from the Little Big Horn, and a wild ride on a ceratopsian -- all done in impeccable late-19th century prose -- and you have a most entertaining confection. Recommended, with the usual caveat that others' reaction to (alleged) humor is notoriously unpredictable.<br /><br />Brett Davis, whose writing I haven't previously encountered, has clearly done his historical homework. He writes in a spritely mock-Victorian style that's just right for the tale. This is a very amusing book. Fluff, but *good* fluff. I picked this one up on a whim, having heard of neither author nor title. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Pete Tillman<br />Consulting Geologist, Tucson & Santa Fe (USA)	2000-12-24

Barney he ain't.<br /><br />Author Frank de Courten is a palaeontologist, formerly at the You of You, now at Sierra College in California. De Courten, with handlebar mustachio and cowboy hat, fits comfortably into the romantic image of a Dinologist, and he's well-aware of the popular appeal of the critters. Fortunately he's literate too (another pretty-common trait in the trade, thank heavens), and his prose reads smoothly, though you're going to have to be *seriously* interested to get through all 300 oversize pages...<br /><br />But it's a beautiful book, nice heavy smooth paper, full cloth binding, lots of color photos, some really *outstanding* color plates  by artist Carel van Kampen -- really, it's a lot of book for [the money].

Don't miss it.	____________________________________________<br />I don't know about you, but when I get a big photo book, I thumb through the photos first, then go back and look at them individually, and read the  text last, if at all -- skim it, usually. So -- the photos here are  magnificent! Color printing has gotten pretty close to photographic quality  in the last few years, and you won't find better-quality color than in  \\"Egyptian Treasures.\\" Book design (by PB Lovisetti & C.  Zanotti) is clean and attractive. Bravo!<br /><br />The artifacts, all from Cairo's  Egyptian Museum, span some 4,000 years -- and for 3,000 years, from the  First Dynasty to the Roman conquest, their artistic conventions stayed  pretty much the same -- enough so that almost any artwork from this period  is, even at a casual glance, obviously 'Egyptian.'<br /><br />Anyway, if you're over  12, and have been to any fair-size art or archaeological museum, you've  seen some mummies, coffins and statues, probably some jewelry and woodwork  too -- not to mention pictures of the Pyramids and King Tut's gold. But,  unless you've been to dozens of Egyptian collections, you've never seen the  range of first-rate art displayed here -- unless, of course, you've already  been to Cairo. Makes me want to go out & buy a ticket to Egypt. Some of  this stuff is just astonishing. The jewelry is (often) 'Art-Deco', not by  coincidence, since much of this material was unearthed in the early 20th  century. And if you've only seen the knock-offs, wait til you see the  originals! There are wall-paintings that, if they didn't have papyrus  plants, you'd think were Chinese. And the little painted wood-carvings,  with marvelous scenes from everyday life -- and with colors so bright, they  could have been your grandmother's, instead of being 4,000 years old.  There's a lot to be said for using the desert for cemeteries....<br /><br />The text  is by 16 (or so) specialists, and ranges from pretty good to instant  eye-glaze. You don't buy this kind of book for the text. Fortunately, the  photo captions are uniformly good. Complaints: no map, and no index! C'mon,  folks -- we don't all know where Tanis is, or Zagazig.

I've read a couple of world-building books and they were  pretty dry. This is the real thing -- a respected planetary scientist  (Codirector of the Space Engineering Research Center at the University of  Arizona) reporting on recent discoveries of extrasolar planets, and  speculating on the range of possible planets that might host life.  Lewis  does a nice run-through of possible planetary surface chemistries for  \\"life as we don't know it\\", and reluctantly concludes that  extraterrestrial life will most likely be carbon-based and use water as a  solvent, because both are the best available by far. Which isn't to say  that we won't find some very odd critters out there...<br /><br />And I don't mean  to imply that general readers won't enjoy Worlds without End -- I recommend  it to anyone who's curious about how solar-systems form.<br /><br />This is a  better-written book than his Mining the Sky (1996), though Lewis still gets  annoyingly cutesy at times. Anyway, it's almost always a pleasure to read a  pop-sci book written by a working scientist.

This is silly but engaging fluff, sort of  a Nancy Drew in space -- but much better-written. It's a pleasure to see  the Telzey stories back in print -- I'd forgotten the breezy assurance of  Schmitz's voice. Besides six Telzey 'chapters', first published as short  stories 1962-71, there are two related stories: the nasty, pulpy  \\"Blood of Nalakia\\" (1953), & a nice (if routine) space-piracy  thriller, \\"The Star Hyacinths\\" (1961). Plus, there's a great  polychrome and foil cover (Telzey with a pride of crest cats) by Bob  Eggleton.<br /><br />Editor Flint has done a nice job of assembling the Telzey  stories into a coherent fixup [note 1], and publisher Baen is to be  commended for introducing a new generation of readers to the pleasures of  reading Schmitz -- until this, there was only one Schmitz book still in  print.<br /><br />James H. Schmitz (1911-1981) is best-remembered for his wonderful  Witches of Karres (1966) and the Telzey stories, all set in a far-future  Federation of the Hub.

P2G's unhinging of time<br />reminds me of Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, and Karen's<br />working-out of her predicament is as intricate and recursive as the<br />best of Philip K. Dick.<br /><br />Readers of Preternatural won't be surprised to learn that it's Fuschia,<br />that naughty S. oteri, one of the telepathic ET jellyfish who inspired<br />and bedeviled Karen in the first book, up to hir old tricks -- the S.<br />oteri live in the Long Now, and have trouble with the idea of<br />sequential time. You don't need to have read the first book to enjoy<br />the second, but if you liked the first, you're probably already headed<br />for the bookstore and I'm preaching to the choir.... Anyway, if you're<br />new to MWB, it would make sense to start with P1, which is out in<br />paperback (Tor, $6, ISBN: 0812567641). They're both pretty amazing<br />books.<br /><br />In both books, you need to pay close attention to all the balls in the<br />air, but when MWB's running a hot hand, like Joe Slattermill in Fritz<br />Leiber's wonderful \\"Gonna Roll the Bones\\" [note 2], her aim is<br />true and her eye (and pen) unerring, She can be trusted to bring<br />matters to a satisfying conclusion, with tantalizing hints of more to<br />come:  \\"She turned and headed straight for home, but she took the<br />long way, around the world.\\"  (with apologies to Mr. Leiber's shade)<br /><br />And while you're keeping your eye on the ball, you'll enjoy watching<br />MWB's characters come to life, notably her multiple alterselves and<br />their friends [note 3], while she ignores her agent's no-autobiography<br />advice -- or is she just counterfeiting Real Life exceptionally well? It<br />*is* fiction, after all, isn't it? -- and it's enormously entertaining<br />reading, which is what I look for, and, I'm sure, so do you.<br /><br />______________________<br /><br />Note 1.)

He was a distinguished book reviewer (for the NewYork Times and Herald-Tribune) and did much to raise literary standards for SF, both as an editor and critic, and as the author of the wry, literate, understated and still very readable stories collected here: 43 sf/f/h shorts (plus a 'poem' and a recipe), mostly written between 1940 and 1952.<br /><br />This is a collection to be read a story or two at a time, or at least that's how I read it. Boucher's best stories -- \\"The Quest for St. Aquin\\", \\"The Compleat Werewolf\\", \\"Snulbug\\", \\"They Bite\\", \\"The Star Dummy\\" -- have entered the permanent sf/f/h repertoire and will be familiar to most, umm, 'mature' readers. I would urge younger readers, who could hardly be expected to drop 25 bucks on a collection of half-century old stories by someone they've barely heard of, to borrow the collection from your public library, and try (at least) the stories listed above. As in any complete collection, there are minor works, though I found everything here at least readable. A sample:<br /><br /> I am the very model of a modern s f editor.<br />  My publisher is happy, as is each and every creditor.<br />  I know the market trends and how to please the newsstand<br />  purchaser;<br />  With agents and name authors my relations can't be courteouser.<br />  .<br />  .<br />  .<br />  In short, in manners monetary, social, and promotional,<br />  I am the very model of a pro s f devotional.<br /><br /> (copyright 1953, 1999 W.A.P. White estate)<br /><br />As always, NESFA books are a pleasure to read & hold: smooth, creamy paper, solid, full-cloth bindings, and a fine period cover of \\"Wolfie\\" by Jane Dennis. I do wish that editor Mann would have included a bit more biographical information about the author -- a page and a half seems skimpy.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Pete Tillman	2000-07-21

Have a look at the cover-scan at Amazon -- a preview of Wayne Barlowe's wonderful color plates. I bogged down in  the anatomy lessons -- the occipital condyle dimensions seem important, but  MEGO. The interior art is very nice. And I really like such tidbits as  learning that William Buckland, who wrote the first formal dinosaur  fossil-description in 1824, kept a pet bear in his house at Oxford. So  there may be more here about old horned-face than you want to know, but you  owe it to yourself, at least, to look at the wonderful Barlowe plates and  read about the fieldwork. For a dino-dilettante like myself, the highlights  of dino-books are the color plates, and I would certainly buy a nice, big  \\"best-of\\" color dino-book. My nominations for artists would  include Wayne Barlowe, Carel van Kampen (Dinosaurs of Utah), Doug Henderson  (Dawn of the Dinosaurs), and others. If such a book exists, I haven't seen  it. Have you? Publishers, take note....<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Pete Tillman<br />Consulting Geologist, Tucson & Santa Fe (USA)	2000-03-15

Not this one -- the authors interpreted the theme loosely enough so that I didn't lose interest.  Walter Jon Williams  takes a killer look at cybernetic family values in \\"Daddy's  World\\", and Jack McDevitt delivers the most interesting look at  gengineering one's progeny since Greg Egan's wonderfully sly  \\"Eugene,\\"  in \\"Dead in the Water.\\" McDevitt's  mother-to-be is particularly well-drawn. A+ stories both;  look for them on  the award ballots next year. \\"A\\" stories:  Silverberg's 1957  \\"There Was an Old Woman\\" is an amazingly fresh look at cloned  lives, even 40 years on. Nina Kiriki Hoffman takes a sharp look at future  retail clerks in \\"One Day at Central Convenience Mall.\\" New  author Janni Simner cleverly inverts bringing up baby in \\"Raising  Jenny\\", and Richard Parks takes a close look at cloning's impact on  showbiz in \\"Doppels.\\" Plus \\"A-\\" (= flawed but very  good) stories by Sage Walker, Susan Palwick, Patricia McKillip, Wm. F Wu,  Doyle & Macdonald, and Kara Dalkey. Curiously, the only weak story in  the bunch is by the editor. Overall: 2 \\"A+\\", 4 \\"A\\", 6  \\"A-\\", 1 \\"B+\\", and 1 \\"B\\" story.<br /><br />The  best original anthology I've seen this year. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Happy reading--<br />Peter D.

Bravo!	220 million years ago, Arizona was near the equator. The trees that became the Petrified Forest grew on a broad, humid floodplain with lakes and swamps, somewhat like today's Amazon basin, or a more tropical Louisiana.  Most of the trees that were petrified were araucaria conifers, related to  present-day Norfolk Island pines. Swimming in these waters were  prong-toothed sharks and thorny-snouted fish. Giant carnivorous metoposaurs  lurked in the muddy swamp bottoms, while great crocodilian phytosaurs  hunted the first true dinosaurs on dryer land.<br /><br />Doug Henderson's moody,  atmospheric paintings bring these scenes to life. Robert Long, formerly  park paleontologist at Petrified Forest, assures scientific accuracy.  Veteran natural-history writer Rose Houk brings polish to the text.  McQuiston, as usual, provides an elegant book design. This is a beautiful  book. It would be a fine companion for (or memento  of) a visit to the Petrified Forest, and a nice gift for a dino-lover.

Highly recommended	Karen Rohmer Guerreri is writing an SF novel -- working title,<br />\\"Preternatural\\" -- by taking dictation from telepathic ET jellyfish in<br />her head. \\"Talking jellyfish!\\" sneers her soon-to-be ex-husband<br />Ray. \\"You'll never sell this!\\"<br /><br />Ray's a jerk, but he's understandably upset -- he's been seeing<br />jellyfish too. As have most of the characters in the book. It's not<br />the sort of thing you, um, share with family & friends...<br /><br />More plot summary than this really isn't going to help --<br />think \\"Wine of the Dreamers\\" meets Phillip K Dick, with all<br />*kinds* of genre, literary and TV/cinematic references<br />and in-jokes (I'm pretty dense about picking these up --<br />you'll likely catch more than I did). In the world of Academic<br />Lit. this is \\"self-referential deconstruction\\" and a Big Deal --<br /><br />-- but in plain language it's an astonishing juggling act. Round and<br />round, up & down they go:  autobiography, the writer's craft, how<br />your kids grew up while you weren't looking, Trekkie fangirl turns<br />pro, midlist writer goes to SF conventions, Hollywood business<br />deals (\\"trust me\\"), exposition by transposing characters to alternate<br />timelines(!), crystal healing, bilingual puns (the aliens' Linnean<br />name is S. oteri:  sound it out & groan...), a Capt. Kirkish actor who<br />can't get it up & blames the jellyfish...<br /><br />  \\"If  PRETERNATURAL has a flaw, it is that the reader must be<br />  willing to keep so many balls in the air, trusting that the author<br />  will eventually reveal how each fits into the pattern. Let me<br />  assure you that Ms. Bonanno is worthy of your trust.

This is a remarkable book, an \\"audacious act of<br />imagination that goes far beyond the merely clever. The puzzle that<br />she poses has to do with the nature of language.

I remembered these as throwaways, but they've aged well.<br />Rainbow Mars is a novel-length sequel, so you'd be well-advised to<br />thumb over to the reprints first, in the back of the book, to properly set the<br />stage for the main event....<br /><br />Which involves -- hmm, how to say this without spoiling the fun --<br />a *very* fast-paced visit to a Martian past that's an amalgam of<br />(and homage to) Burroughs, Wells, Bradbury & Heinlein -- with<br />Integral Tree-style beanstalks thrown in as an illustration of Being<br />Careful of what you wish for. Not to mention a Princess of Mars, and<br />how she learned to surf. And sex in a hot-tub. And enough insider<br />jokes and references to challenge the memory of the best-read fan.<br /><br />&#34;This is my take on Mars, and Yggdrasil, and (God help me) the space program&#34;<br />-- done up in a delicious hard-fantasy souffle'. Bon appetit!<br /><br />Niven's pretty near the top of his form here -- he obviously had great<br />fun writing this. I liked the &#34;mature&#34; tone of Destiny's Road -- but (to<br />quote Dave Barry), &#34;what I look forward to, is continued immaturity<br />followed by death.&#34;<br /><br />Rainbow Mars is getting mixed reviews; recursive-sf humor clearly<br />isn't to everyone's taste. If you haven't liked previous light Niven --<br />Svetz, Warlock, Fallen Angels -- this may not be for you. Rainbow<br />Mars may not win him many new converts, but Niven trufans -- and<br />readers who like a tall tale well-told -- will be well-pleased.<br /><br />Review copyright 1999 by Peter D.

Highly recommended	______________________________________________<br />These are the best mountain lion photographs I've ever seen, and<br />one of the best wildlife-photography books I know of. The text is<br />competent and well-researched, but the real attraction is Cox's<br />wonderful photos. If you have any interest in wildcats, you need this<br />book. Or if you need a gift for a cat-lover ....<br /><br />Cox photographed mainly captive-bred cats; this is evident only in<br />the extraordinary intimacy of the photos, such as one of the mother<br />cat giving birth, and many of appealing blue-eyed, spotted cubs at<br />play. I'd have liked to know how he took the one where the lion is<br />leaping straight into the camera. Or the one where it looks like he<br />was in the same sandstone cave with the lion, in Utah's magnificent<br />canyonlands.  Or the cat in mid-leap over a chasm. Sadly, such details<br />are conspicuous by their absence; the text is resolutely generic.<br /><br />But this is quibbling. The photos speak for themselves -- like the cat<br />who's treed a porcupine, and (next photo, please) gets a snootful of<br />quills. The publisher's puff copy calls this \\"the most extraordinary<br />photographic book on mountain lions ever published.\\" I would<br />agree, and recommend it highly.<br /><br />Review copyright 1999 by Peter D.
