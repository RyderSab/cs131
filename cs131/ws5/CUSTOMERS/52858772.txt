As a fan of longer fiction as opposed to short stories (and also a fan of  Lovecraft's Mythos tales) it's always great to find full length stories  like this.<br />Nightmare's Disciple is a great tale about a Mythos-mad serial  killer in the present day.  It was fun guessing throughout the whole novel:  'Is Lovecraft's Mythos real or is it just this killer who thinks it  is?&quot;<br />The only thing I had a hard time with and disliked more and  more as the novel progressed was the amazing amount of space dedicated to  pop-culture.  As a Lovecraft fan I am used to his references of ancient  texts and so forth.  However, in Pulver's novel he seems to use it as a  showcase for everything he knows about pop-culture.  Characters discuss for  page after page about Lovecraft and his disciples, authors like Lumley,  Howard, even Rice and King.  All kinds of music and musical styles (even  lines from songs are used as prose in the novel, while cute at first, it  becomes a major distraction later on in the novel) horror movies, models,  posters, art, comics, just about every little thing you can imagine.<br />Sort  through all of that and you have yourself a good novel that I really  enjoyed.  An excellent debut story from Mr. Pulver whom I hope continues on  with more full length Mythos work.  It appears the publishers 'Chaosium',   while not accustomed to publishing full length Mythos work should have  assigned a tougher editor for this novel.  If some of the redundant  information was cut it Would have made a much tighter and suspenseful  story.  It should not have been left up to Pulver alone on his first major  work.<br />Overall Mr. Pulver should be commended for his work on his first  full length novel!  Hopefully as he produces more work, he will stick with  fewer topics and not branch off into all of his interests.	2000-08-25

My only wish is that there was more action in Defilers.

Brian Lumley has brought us a new Necroscope for a New Century!<br />Fans of his all know about Harry Keogh and the amazing, but terrible powers he had.  Not to mention how exciting his adventures were.<br />Now Lumley is  revisiting the Wamphyri threat with both new and old characters.  Invaders  is book one in his new three book trilogy.<br />The novel has some excellent  action in it and the standard amazing Lumley creations.  The only problem I  saw in it is that it felt very incomplete (obviously since this is a  trilogy I suppose), but it would have been nice if this could have stood  more on it own other than it did.  I came away with a feeling that I had  only read a 'set-up' novel for the books to come.<br />Still, it's Lumley!   It's Necroscope!  It's here!	2000-07-17

As Poul Anderson's lone entry in the Conan series I was looking forward to seeing what he does with the character.<br />Overall he did a nice job but unfortunately he kept Conan in a lovesick mood thoughout the novel.  With  plenty of opportunities for 'casual copulation' Conan is in constant  conflict.  He loves his mate, but has been away from her for so long it is  driving him crazy.  With such opportunities and beautiful women all around,  Conan should have taken at least one!<br />Oh well, so Conan's morals were  different in this novel than what I am used to, still it was a good tale.   Unlike so many of these post-Howard Conan tales, careful construction of  the other characters in the novel are obviously made.  The three friends  Conan meets and adventures with, his lover, and his enemies are introduced  and developed throughout the story quite nicely.  Near the end of the story  you wish that the party could forget their pasts and just adventure  together on an entirely new adventure!<br />One of the better Conan novels I  have read so far, it contains gods, magical weapons, women, adventure, and  sorcery...everything that should be in a Conan novel (but sometimes is  not!).<br />Still, compared to more original Sword and Sorcery novels like  Brian Lumley's Khash stories or any of Howard's original fiction, this is  just an average yarn to revisit a favorite old character.	2000-06-08

Also, until the character  names (especially the gods and such) stick in your head. it will be a  little difficult to follow because you don't really remember what happened  previously to them.<br />But eventually they do, and about midway through the  collection I was enthralled.

Spooky, and frightening, I don't think I ever want to get hyptonized,  ever.<br />I really enjoyed this novel, but would have liked it more if there  were a few more characters that the main character could sense.  I really  sympathized with the main character's family, but never really liked anyone  else in the novel.<br />The ending is pretty good, but I felt like the  suspense ran out of gas a little more that midway through.

This one I'm giving an average rating.  Overall it  moves just like the film, although some of the action and most of the  comedy that was in the film, is missing in the novel.  Madmartigan's humour  must have totally relied on Val Kilmer's performance.  The other characters  are up to par though.<br />The greatest reason to read this novel as a fan of  the movie are the few scenes that must have been cut, or too expensive for  the film.  One thing that totally shocked me was the entire new character  and storyline that was missing from the film!  Sorsha's father!  In the  film you never meet him.  In the novel it is great!<br />It's a short novel  that took me a sitting to read.  I don't recommend this novel to anyone  other than fans of Willow, who will really enjoy the missing bits from the  film!	2000-03-27

The Last Command was a good read.  After going through all the highs and lows of this trilogy, the ending was written in classic Star Wars fashion.  Grande Admiral Thrawn who I didn't think too fondly of in this last novel  (I found he was using his hunches too much and found it getting silly, as  opposed to earlier novels where he had a reason to be so calculating, like  artwork examination or personality traits) had a great scene in the end of  the novel.  I loved it and it made the novel for me.  <br />Overall after  reading this concluding chapter in Zhan's trilogy I've found I really love  the new characters.  Previously I couldn't have cared less about Mara Jade,  et al.  but Zhan finally does it in this one.  The characters are great.  I  now feel sad about reaching the end and will have to find out what other  novels are out there that use these new characters.	2000-03-22

Dark Force Rising is my second Star Wars novel I have read (aside from the film novelizations).<br />I found it less exciting than Heir To The Empire, but it won't stop me from readin the next in the series The Last  Command.<br />Throughout the novel I found too much diplomacy and politics.  I  was intrigues by them in the first novel, but in this one it starts to  become too much.  Where Heir to The Empire contained a good mix of action  and intrugue mixed in, Dark Force Rising does not.  Only a few scenes in  the entire novel have any real non political conflict.

Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley had great chemisty and it worked perfectly.<br />In the novel Kilmer's Madmartigan character doesn't come through as well.  His wise-cracking  antics and such are not presented well, if they are present at all.<br />The  novel lacks description.  Not of just places and people, but of actions.   Too much does it rely on script-like dialogue to tell the story.  Leaving  the reader to figure out on their own what s happening during  dialogues.<br />Like most novelizations, I read this one to hopefully hear a  little more that went on in the story.  Thankfully it was there.  Some  strange additions and welcome additions were in this novel.  Entirely new  characters and small new storylines are there.  To my shock there is a  red-haired king involved of which I don't want to go into too much detail,  but the novel really surprised me with this little tidbit.<br />I grabbed a  copy of this novel mainly to introduce me to the stories by George Lucas  and Chris Claremont series that takes place after this story.  Shadowmoon,  Shadowdawn, and Shadowstar.<br />I don't regret that I read this novel as it  only took me one sitting, but hopefully the rest of the Willowish novels  will be better.	2000-03-07

If  you are like me and want to read virtually all of Lumley's works, then I  highly suggest reading the Dreamlands saga after reading Spawn Of The Winds  in Mythos Omnibus Volume Two.

Being so accustomed to Lumley's many series' of books, it was strange to see one just stand out with out any sequels or related novels. <br />Once again Lumley's characters  were well developed. I loved em or hated them. I don't know really what to  compare this book to, but lets just imagine that we are in a house on Earth  that was placed here by aliens. The house is mainly an alien laboratory  where they can watch us interact with each other and see how we behave  (much like we do to mice in a maze). Now throw a bunch of doors in this  house and behind them all something new. Horrors not to be believed. How do  we react? How would you react? <br />Lumley really drew out the emotions for  this one. When one of the characters are in trouble, man, you really get  into it.

The stories contained in this  collection are: The Fairground Horror, by Brian Lumley The Silence of Erika  Zann, by James Wade All-Eye, by Bob van Laerhoven The Tugging, by Ramsey  Campbell Where Yidhra Walks, by Walter C. DeBill, Jr. Glimpses, by A.A.  Attanasio Dope War of the Black Tong, by Robert M. Price Darkness, My Name  is, by Eddy C. Bertin The Terror from the Depths, by Fritz Leiber Lumley's  The Fairground Horror was a smooth flowing excellent story. The Silence of  Erika Zann was surprising. I loved it. Dope War of the Black Tong was a  cool action packed tough guy story which I found extremely entertaining,  and finally Darkness, My Name is, was pretty good too. The other stories  were easily forgotten. I'm not saying anything against them, I love Ramsey  Campbell and the others, but the ones I mentioned earlier really stick out  in my mind and were really entertaining. A couple of the stories I found  not interesting at all though. Overall if you are an H.P. Lovecraft fan it  is a pretty good collection I'm happy I got it.	2000-03-03

I have been a huge fan of the Star Wars films and have read the four novelizations of the films that have been currently released.  I liked them and found they fleshed out the films  well.<br />This is the first Star Wars novel that isn't already a film that I  have read.  It took getting used to.  <br />At first I was apprehensive about  all these new characters that were being introduced in the novel.  I  figured who cares?  I wanted to read about Han, Leia, Luke, Chewie, etc.   Not these new guys Mara, Thrawn, etc.<br />The writing style took some getting  used to for me as well.  Starting from the very beginning of the novel you  get short little blurbs of what is happening to a character and the plot  that is happening, then it would switch to a different character's story,  then another, then yet another.  It led to me not really caring about any  of the characters until I had enough information (which was over halfway  through the novel).  <br />After the halfway mark I find I must have finally  accepted and begun to like the new characters in the story.  The major  contributing factor that this was the turning point in the story was the  combining of the individual character's stories.  Mara ran into Luke, Han  and Lando ran into Mara and Luke, the only person not really reunited near  the end was Leia.  <br />Perhaps that's why I really enjoyed the ending as  everyone was practically involved.  It was action intense and hyped me for  the next novel.  If not for the last half of the novel, I don't think I  would continue woth this series, but the slow combination of separate plots  made this novel interesting.  It just took a while to get used to the new  characters and read the Star Wars series 'in a straight novel form'.	2000-03-03

This Paul Ganley edition of The Compleat Khash Volume One - Never A Backward Glance is to my knowledge, the only edition ever published in North America.<br />The stories in it are apparently the combined short  adventures of Lumley's Conanish character Tarra Khash, which were written  for Wierdbook and possibly other publications. Don't let this fool you  though, it reads like a novel.<br />Similar to his Hero and Eldin adventures  in Lumley's Dreamworlds saga, Khash adventures throughout the ancient  continent of Theem'hdra (when all the continents were one..the Pangea).  <br />He finds both friends and foes. Various gods and different races make  their appearances as well.<br />Overall a good read. It is an early novel of  Lumley's and since I am trying to be a Lumley completist I got this one. I  am not disappointed. There is also a volume 2 of collected Khash stories as  well.	2000-03-03

Hmm, espionage, esp, I wonder what Brian Lumley likes to write about?  <br />This 'Psychomech' trilogy I stumbled upon because well, I couldn't find anything else written by Brian Lumley around.  <br />Brian's work may seem  pretty easy to find at the present time.  But I had to try special ordering  everything of his here in Winnipeg.  This series was one of the few that  were available aside from his Necroscope work.  I needed something to tie  me over until the next Vampire story by Lumley!   <br />The story is about a  character named Richard Garrison.  Another likable lead character.  He is  in the military and is blinded saving the wife and child of some civilian.   Turns out this civilian is pretty well off and seems to be grateful.  He  hires Garrison to assist him in his research.  Research dealing with ESP,  the paranormal, and even immortality. <br />Garrison eventually meets up with  a machine called the Psychomech.  It amplifieds his amazing powers that he  develops.  There is also an evil presence on Earth researching this same  power.  Each become aware of each other and each knows that they must stop  each other.  This leads up to a pretty good finale.	2000-03-03

There seemed to ba a little bit of consistency problems with the three novels as  in Jedi, Chewie, Artoo, and others that speak different languages were  formatted and written differently than the other two novels.  Also in Jedi  is the first time See-Threepio is written as C-3PO.<br />Other than that they  are pretty good.  What I usually like about reading good novelizations is  being able to read about what chatacters are actually thinking.  There is  that here as I get to know what Vader thinks, and Luke.<br />Some intersting  new stuff is introduced that you barely notice in the films (if they were  in the films at all).  For example Luke's best friend on Tatooine.<br />If you  are a Star Wars fan I recommend them.  They are short tiny novels (all  three are just over 400 pages total) so it's not going to take forever and  they are easy reads.	2000-02-28

What can I say about the Vampire Chronicles?  They were refreshing and new!  That were exciting!  That is, until this novel came out.  The one pictures is a Knopf Canada first edition that I bought as soon as this  novel was released.  Unfortunately it was a mistake.<br />I loved the first  three novels in the Chronicles, but this one is radically different.  It  takes place in the present time which isn't too bad.  Lestat, becomes human  once again and has quite an adventure.  <br />I felt like I was reading a  Superman novel.  Lestat was relegated to superhero status whom had just  swallowed Kryptonite and lost all his powers.  The love scenes in the novel  we all guys!  Not my fetish, I'd prefer not to hear about how my once  favorite vampire would secretly love to sleep with his friends.<br />Lestat  and this novel got so wishy washy that it was the last of the Anne Rice  novels I ever read, and I loved Anne Rice's previous works!

The chase to capture the killer in this novel does have  it's suspense.  I am looking forward to reading Silence of the Lambs now.

I had wanted to start out reading the Conan novels by getting a collection of Robert E. Howard's, but unfortunately that was not to be as all the online, used and local bookstores had nada.   Absolutely nothing by Robert E. Howard (at least in his Conan novels). <br />I  decided on getting Conan The Bold mainly because it was one of the earliest  in the list of Conan novels that is printed inside the TOR Conan books.  I  enjoyed it.<br />I was really looking forward to reading a novel in this  setting as I just loved Brian Lumley's Terra Khash novels.  I figured they  must be similar.  The setting and Conan character was quite similar.   However, Lumley's Khash ran into a lot of Lovecraftian enemies and more  formidable foes than Conan in this novel.  Sure the final showdown between  the hated foe in this novel, Taharka had it's gods in the background, but  basically it was Conan and his lovely one-eyed warrior girl, Kalya chasing  two bandits/slavers/murders/pirates across the world.  I was totally  enthralled until perhaps three quarters of the book.  The best part of this  book for me was the showdown in the slave pits where slaves were forced to  battle each other after being drugged.  Conan's entrance was thrilling.    Unfortunately it continued on.  Not that it was bad, but the next showdown  was a big letdown.  Things looked good when they caught up with them again,  but somehow the bandits escaped.  Then yet another time they caught up with  them and they escaped (by this time I'd just about had it.  It was getting  redundant and boring.), then they run into them again.  <br />Basically it's a  novel where our hero chases the bad guy across the world just finding them  and coming so close to killing him, yet the baddie always seems to be able  to sneak away in the night.  <br />Good halfway through the novel, but after  that it got a little ridiculous and I don't want to give away the ending,  but the Kalya final battle was quitepredictable and a little silly.<br />I'll  read some more Conan as the novels have been written by many different  people (hopefully I can find Howard's novels quick!), but unless the cover  states a really cool plot on the back, I'm going to try to steer away from  another John Maddox Roberts Conan novel unless I have no other Conan  options.  On a technical note, there were quite a few typos in this novel,  c'mon TOR get with it!	2000-01-14

I loved the storyline that George Lucas was developing in the film, and figured the novel would have an even better  one.<br />To my surprise it was different. Where I came home from the film  feeling that the movie was mainly about politics and how the Star Wars  senate works (with some interesting twists...don't want to spoil it of  course!), this novel really developed the characters of Anakin Skywalker  and Queen Amidala. <br />Anakin, to me, was a virtual non factor in the film  aside from two major scenes, pretty well stole this book. The story on  Tatooine lasts practically through three quarters of the novel, unlike the  short amount of time in the film. Also the relationship between Anakin and  Amidala is explained in detail here.<br />It fleshes out the movie. It's too  bad they couldn't make the movie at least one more hour long so they could  have fleshed it out as well as this novel. One thing strange in the novel  is Dark Siddeous' identity. In the film it is pretty obvious, you can see  the faces, in the novel, it is never explained. You can't tell who he is. I  suppose we will leave that to the next Star Wars adaptation to  do!<br />Overall a good read if you liked the way the story developed in the  film.

I liked the movie and so started to read this series.  Red Dragon being the first one was quite enjoyable.  I'm not big into 'thrillers', but Red Dragon kept me interested.<br />The Silence Of The Lambs is noted as a classic  horror movie.  Hopkins and Foster played amazingly in that film. So the  book should be even better right?  Wrong.  Sure you get to know the serial  killer more, and what his history was, et cetera, et cetera.  But basically  I was quite amazed to find out that the film contained basically everything  good about the novel!<br />Whenever I was reading the Lecter scenes, I  imagined Hopkins slow deep voice saying the words.  They were the best  parts of the story.  <br />I was planning on reading straight through the  series if I really liked the novels, but now I think I am at least going to  wait until Hannibal comes out on paperback.  I found this novel not to be  the classic the movie is.<br />Aside from maybe completing this series, I  don't think I will be experimenting with reading thrillers again.	2000-01-14

It's a history of the first forty years of Playboy magazine.  I'm not afraid to say that I can be your basic white trash and enjoy this one.  It shows the stories, news,  sports, cartoons, and the women that Playboy has had between it's covers.   <br />What is neat about the book for me, were two things:<br />The history of  Playboy.  For example did you know that January 1958's Playmate Elizabeth  Ann Roberts had to get a note from her mother to appear nude in Playboy?   Hefner was then charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and  from then on demanded that all his model be 18.<br />The women.  Not all  Playmates became stars, but a lot were interesting like the above mentioned  Playmate.  There have been major stars like Betty Page, Marilyn Monroe,  Sharon Stone, Pam Anderson, Vanna White, Madonna, Tanya Roberts, et cetera,  et cetera, in the magazine as well.<br />Say all you want, I'm glad this one  is on my bookshelf to peruse through.	2000-01-14

Ghor is a nice blend of Conan and the Cthulhu Mythos together.  Abandoned  as a child because of a deformity, Ghor is adopted by a pack of wolves.   Raised by them, he adopts the ways of the wolf, yet when he meets up with  humanity joins them.  Constantly struggling with his wolf upbringing and  his human surroundings, Ghor becomes a mighty war hero wherever he  goes.<br />This is an excellent adventure book that takes a Conan like hero  and plots him against all sorts of evil (and good), including some Cthulhu  creations as well.  <br />Originally Ghor was an unfinished story by Conan  creator Robert Howard.  Upon finding this unfinished story, a magazine  decided to finish it.  What they did was have a different chapter every  month written by a different top fantasy writer.  It made the reading  interesting.  <br />While most of the chapters were great.  Some were  excellent.  Unfortunately there were a couple chapters that I just wanted  to get through to reach the next writers' chapter.  Overall a really good  read.	1998-09-24
US	52858772	R4218PKLW6FH3	0061096644	861222021	Underboss	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Underboss a fun romp through Mafia life.	I have to admit. I know nothing about the Mafia and have never been a fan of Gangster novels. <br />When a friend of mine handed me this novel, I took one look at the cover and figured what the heck, I'll try it out (I had just seen Serpico late one night recently, and on the cover it said Peter Maas...author of Serpico).<br />This was a good read. At least for me, who knew nothing about Mafia life or anything about Sammy Gravano or any of his associates. While some chapters were dry, it was really interesting to see how the mob did business in New York and across the country. <br />I would recommend this novel to anyone who has an interest in reading about life in the mafia, or even someone that likes to read biographies.	1998-09-24

Sith, the renegade Thone is back and he wants to kick our butt!   (Especially those whom he tested during his last visit).  <br />Just like the  House Of Doors, this novel takes us through to the different nightmare  worlds of our adventurers.  A few of the characters return from the first  novel, and there are new characters as well. Some of the nightmare worlds  are familiar, and some are new.  <br />Pretty good read.  I am an avid Lumley  fan so sometimes I tend to be biased.  All I will say is that while it  isn't as fresh an idea as House Of Doors (it is a sequel after all)  it  still grips you.  Some of the worlds scare the heck outta you, and a couple  of the new characters are interesting to follow.  I was only upset about  the death toll of the main characters in the book.  I won't go any further  (don't wanna ruin the fun!)	1998-08-25
