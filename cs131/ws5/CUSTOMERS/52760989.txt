The images of the burning buildings, the people jumping from windows, and the escapees fleeing for their lives are etched in our memories forever. These exterior images are intriguing and often scary, but what we don't get to hear much about is what took place inside the burning buildings as workers and visitors tried to escape. This book , \\"102 Minutes\\", fills this void by taking us inside the towers, explaining what it was like to be trapped inside, fighting to get out of these massive, blazing structures.<br /><br />The title of this book is taken from the fact that it was 102 minutes from the moment the first plane struck to the moment the second tower collapsed and fell to the ground. The book starts off by getting right into the action, describing the mood and feelings of some of the workers who were in their offices close to the point of impact when the first airliner crashed through the upper floors of the North Tower. From this point, the book moves in sequence and it includes time stamps at the beginning of each chapter so that you know what time of day it was at each point and how close it is to the final moment, when the second tower collapses.<br /><br />This book is loaded with names of different people. It jumps around from building to building and from room to room and it includes direct quotes from people as spoken on answering machines, 911 emergency hotlines, and the buildings own intercom speaker system. It lets you hear, in their own words, what some of the evacuees were feeling during these 102 minutes of chaos and terror. This gives the book a personal dimension that other books on this subject fail to embrace.<br /><br />Besides the people, this book also takes a critical look at the structures of the buildings themselves. There are several diagrams throughout the book, showing the layout of the buildings, the points where the planes struck, the location of the stairwells, etc. The reason these are included is so that the reader can better understand what happened where. They are also included so that readers can better understand why the design of the World Trade Center towers wasn't the best and how it contributed to more deaths. The lack of sufficient stairwells is criticized in this book as the main, preventable problem that kept many people from escaping to safety.<br /><br />I like the way the authors structure this book. I like the time stamps, the diagrams, and the personal quotes and details. The only thing about this book that makes it a little less desirable than it otherwise would be is the fact that there are so many people mentioned within. There are dozens and dozens of people mentioned by name, and this can make the book seem a little chaotic. I suppose I can't really hold this fact against the book because this was, after all, a very chaotic day. But it does get a little difficult to keep track of so many different people.<br /><br />The attack on the World Trade Center Towers is an event that is engrained in our memories forever. The physical images of the burning buildings and people fleeing on foot will never be forgotten. But there was plenty of action going on inside the towers as well and this book does an effective job letting the viewer see what conditions were like inside the smoking buildings as thousands of people scrambled too and fro, fighting for their lives as the twin towers headed closer and closer to their ultimate collapse.

Known for his outspokenness and his relentless support of all things conservative, Hannity has penned a few books in his efforts to spread the word about his political philosophy. This book is his first to be printed and sold on a wide scale, and it contains a few good points along with some spotty and sometimes outrageous logic to back its claims.<br /><br />On the positive side, this book accurately rings a warning bell about the risks of a growing government bureaucracy. It offers some good advice on expanding school choice and for dealing with social problems. Hannity is also correct when he supports the first amendment guarantee of free speech for all. Like the book says, even if we don't agree with our enemies in other political camps, we still have to respect their right to speak their minds.<br /><br />This book gets a little carried away at times, particularly when it addresses the issue of terrorism. This subject pops up throughout the book and while it is certainly an important topic that deserves some attention, Hannity goes a little overboard when he makes certain assessments, like saying that the best national defense is a national offense. I could spend the next several paragraphs explaining how wrong this strategy would be and how much trouble it would cause, but I will spare the details. Let's just say that a national \\"offense\\" would be and has been a disaster that has solved no problems and has created more foreign enemies for the U.S. than it has gained friends.<br /><br />Probably the nuttiest statement made in this book is when Hannity tries to assert that Republicans are moral and good men who almost always tell the truth when running for election to public office! When I read this outrageous proclamation, I almost ended my reading on the spot. I decided to go ahead and finish just to see if any more \\"gems\\" would be uncovered. But it's tough to match a comment this silly, and there was nothing else stated in the book that came close to something so brash and so completely untrue.<br /><br />This book is mostly a print piece for Republican philosophy and it claims to follow the conservative line on most every issue. However, I find it very interesting that there is no criticism of the Bush administration's reckless spending and exploding budget deficits. I think this was left out on purpose, for it would be very difficult to defend Bush and pretend the current president is an advocate of small government when every statistic points in the opposite direction. Instead, the book plays it safe and sticks to the subjects that its author supports and that also run parallel to the practices of the Bush administration.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of its faults, this book is still one that I recommend reading because it does voice a few valid points about school choice, free expression, and the tendency of some left- leaning politicians to exploit specific issues for political gain. It does get a little crazy at times, but the book still has some good points to offer and it refrains from name- calling and general immaturity like you often find in political books written by other politically- minded individuals. Even if you're not a died- in- the- wool conservative, you will find something of value in this book.this silly, and there was nothing else stated in the book that came close to something so brash and so completely untrue.<br /><br />This book is mostly a print piece for Republican philosophy and it claims to follow the conservative line on most every issue.

First- time parents are always looking for answers to questions and they often seek the guidance offered via publications and periodicals. \\"What to Expect when You're Expecting\\" is the book chosen most often to fulfill this task. It contains advice, facts, visuals, and lists to help new parents find the answers to the mysteries of pregnancy.<br /><br />This book is written in an outline format and it is broken into five different sections. The area that new readers turn to most frequently is Part 2, because this is where the book breaks out the different months of pregnancy and lets you know what you should expect at each stage. Months one through nine each have their own chapter and they explain things like what changes a woman might be feeling at each stage; the size of the baby; what tests to run during a visit to the doctor; and much more.<br /><br />I am a new parent and I found this guide to be very useful and informative. I like the lists and the outline- style format with its bulleted text, boldface, and italics to separate similar statements and facts for easy reference. I also like the fact that the guide pays attention not just to numbers and statistics, but also to the emotional side of things, letting you know what bodily changes will take place for a woman and how it can affect her relationship with her spouse.<br /><br />This book is very helpful but I can see how some people will find it too basic to take seriously. Those who have already experienced a previous pregnancy or two will probably write this book off as being too simplistic. This is a valid point, since this book is generally concerned with covering the most important questions that first time moms and dads want answered. Still, I think it can be helpful as a general reference guide, even for those who already know what to expect. No one can remember everything, and this guide can help to fill in the blanks about pregnancy issues.<br /><br />Another thing that needs to be emphasized is that the lists for specific months of one's pregnancy are not necessarily true for all people. For example, the list of possible changes to how one is feeling is not going to be one- hundred percent true for every woman. Lists like this one only illustrate possible changes that might occur at the time. And even though the book clearly states that these are only possible changes, there are still some (particularly first- time moms) who will read this and get nervous, thinking there is something wrong with them because they are not experiencing exactly what the book says.<br /><br />Overall, this book is still one of the better ones on the market for those who want to know more about their pregnancy and \\"what to expect\\". It is probably the best- selling of its kind and it makes a good choice of gifts for the parent to be. I referred to mine many times over the course of the nine months and it proved to be a valuable resource for finding answers to the many questions that arise during this exciting time in a person's life.t the lists for specific months of one's pregnancy are not necessarily true for all people.

If you're like most people, you probably have a strong pro or anti- Bush perception and it is probably the result of either the war against Iraq, economic stagnation, social progress (or lack thereof), or other political ideals. Those who consider themselves conservatives generally support the president and those who are liberal do not.<br /><br />But if one is a true conservative (meaning, wants little government interference in the economy or in personal decisions) then the Bush presidency has to be more than just a disappointment- it has to be regarded as a huge letdown since Bush has expanded the size and scope of government at every opportunity since he took the oath of office early in 2001. This book examines the Bush legacy of the past few years, showing how Bush has grown government to record levels while simultaneously cutting back revenues, creating massive budget deficits that future generations will be forced to pay back.<br /><br />Some of the key areas James Bovard focuses his attention in this book are free trade, the War against Iraq, the War on Terror, and the increases in government that have accompanied this and every other Bush initiative. Many of Bush's violations of the Constitution center around the War on Terror and the efforts to \\"protect\\" the American citizens. Many people are already aware of the so- called \\"Free Speech Zones\\" where protestors are forced to stay when Bush is giving a speech. And most are aware of the airport security mania where ordinary people are treated like criminals in order to make flying \\"safer\\". These violations of individual rights are covered in this book, with the author demonstrating how the Bush administration has manipulated the law and deceived the people to further his own agenda.<br /><br />More time is spent in this book talking about the War on Terror than any other topic. This is because Bush has used this \\"War\\" and the events of September 11, 2001, as an excuse for his government excesses. The fact is, Bush had already adopted the neo- conservative political philosophy (one that calls for growing government to the largest size possible in order to push its own political beliefs, while pretending to believe in small government) long before September 11, 2001. The author effectively shows, through countless examples, how Bush and his team of control freaks manipulate the law and press their agenda on the American people.<br /><br />James Bovard has written critical books in the past about government so this book is nothing new for him. He writes in a style that is appealing and convincing. Instead of ranting and raving about government abuses, he uses concrete examples, backed up with sources, to illustrate what has happened and the hypocrisy and deceit behind various political maneuvers by Bush, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, and others in the Bush administration. He uses sarcasm on occasion, and his biting wit adds to the book's overall appeal.<br /><br />If you're the type who believes in the conservative ideal of small government, you should feel disgusted with the present administration. Bush has grown government to levels beyond imagination. Even if the increases in defense are taken into account, the rate of growth under Bush is still gigantic- much greater than it was under Clinton, a man who conservatives often considered a closet socialist for his use of government power. The \\"Bush Betrayal\\" is a good book for conservatives to read, for it illustrates the unparalleled growth in government under Bush's watch. Don't be fooled when Bush tries to proclaim himself a prophet of small government. Numbers don't lie, and Bush is arguably the biggest abuser of government spending since Lyndon Johnson. Read this book, and educate yourself on the explosion of growth under our current presidential administration.s an excuse for his government excesses.

He has worked with budgets and forecasting and he has some important concerns about the fiscal health of the United States government. He presents some of these concerns in this book, showing how Republicans and Democrats alike are playing Russian roulette with the taxpayer's money.<br /><br />This book details the financial mess in Washington D.C. and the facts it presents are rather alarming. By now, most people are aware of some of the budget problems, like the huge deficits and runaway spending under George W. Bush. Most are also aware of the coming shortfall in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and the fact that the excess funds collected in these programs is recklessly spent by politicians every year. What many people are not aware of, however, is the coming collapse of these systems and the growing strain that interest payments will have on the budget. Bush has accelerated the train wreck by reducing revenues while simultaneously expanding the size and scope of government; borrowing funds to make up the difference and placing future generations at risk.<br /><br />If the picture wasn't already ugly enough from a purely financial standpoint, what makes it even worse is the indifference of politicians toward this growing problem. Peterson covers this issue in the book as well, showing how the politicians in Washington are more concerned with the here and now. Winning the next election is far more important to them then being fiscally responsible. Like the book accurately points out, the main reason for the indifference is that the present crop of congressmen, congresswomen, and presidential administration members know that the serious problems won't occur until well into the future- long after they have retired. Since the harshest problems won't take place while they are in office, they have turned a blind eye to responsibility.<br /><br />This book is loaded with statistics, and this fact could add to its appeal for some people and turn other readers off. Personally, I like the statistical inclusion because it backs up the fears and concerns presented in the book with cold, hard facts. Not only does the book include the present- day budget statistics, it also includes futuristic expectations of revenues and outflows for Social Security, Medicare, and other programs. It shows how these and other programs like them are headed toward bankruptcy if politicians continue to show their collective indifference.<br /><br />Peterson ends the book by suggesting some possible remedies for Washington's budgetary woes. He talks about increasing the Social Security and Medicare payroll tax, raising the retirement age, etc. He even suggests turning the Social Security system into a needs- based retirement fund. This means that, if an individual has sufficient money to cover his/her retirement, they would forfeit all the money they have placed in Social Security. This plan is pretty bad for countless reasons. But the author presents it as a possibility without really debating its merits. He does the same thing when he proposes a forced retirement system- one that would be administered by the U.S. Government and that would be mandatory for all U.S. citizens. Again, this is controversial and would present many problems. But the book offers no debate. It just mentions it as a feasible possibility to address the coming crisis.<br /><br />\\"Running on Empty\\" is a good book for many reasons. I like the way it approaches the issue by facing the hard truth. It doesn't sugar- coat the problem and pretend it will magically disappear in due time. It presents the truth whether you want to hear it or not, backs it up with statistics, and then offers some suggestions for reform. The fiscal situation isn't pretty and it is imperative that we demand action from our political leaders as soon as possible. The livelihood of future generations is at stake and the situation will continue to deteriorate more and more rapidly if we keep putting off these tough decisions until a later date.s is at stake and the situation will continue to deteriorate more and more rapidly if we keep putting off these tough decisions until a later date.	2005-08-22

Molly Ivins is a popular syndicated columnist who writes about political and social issues from her home base in Texas. She has written countless articles scrutinizing George W. Bush and his method of governing. She offers a good perspective, having been a Bush observer now for more than a decade. She has followed the current president from his days as a failed businessman, to his days as a failed governor, all the way to his present days as a failed president. She wrote this book and published it back in 2000, as a forewarning to those who were considering casting their vote for GWB.<br /><br />Ivins, in case most people do not already know, is the type who favors government intervention in the economy in order to improve the lives of the majority of people. Her political philosophy is often at odds with George W., and most of what she writes in this book is critical toward the former Texas governor turned U.S. president. She details many of Bush's political failings; his unethical business dealings; and his deceptive relationship with the religious right. She wants people to see and hear what Bush did while he was governor of the Lone Star State. She wants voters to realize that this man is not worthy of the office of the U.S. presidency.<br /><br />Much of what I read in this book is now old news. Most everyone now knows about the Bush team and its unethical maneuvering to stop rival John McCain from winning the primaries and the Republican nomination. We also know about Bush's failure as a businessman when he was drilling for oil in his home state. And most of us already know about Bush's questionable record of military service in the Texas Air National Guard and the fact that he has taken advantage of his last name to achieve things that would have otherwise been beyond his grasp.<br /><br />Even though this book was published in 2000, there are still a few new tidbits of information about Bush's past that I didn't know until I read this book. Probably the most disgusting was Bush's unethical business practices regarding the Texas Rangers baseball team. Bush, the man who is supposedly against corporate welfare of any kind and believes that businessmen should be able to pull their own weight, took the residents of Arlington, Texas for millions when he and his associates demanded a new stadium (at the expense of taxpayers) or else they would move the team elsewhere. This wasn't illegal, but it was certainly unethical and it flies in the face of what George W. Bush supposedly believes about business and government. Another area of interest was Bush's relationship with the religious right. Bush began courting this group long ago, probably at the urging of his advisors. He is willing to play the game with the members of the religious right, pretending to support their agenda, if it means winning votes. But like any good politician, Bush also knows that he cannot step too far in the theological right direction. Doing so would possibly offend others and cost him some support.<br /><br />It's obvious that Ivins doesn't like Bush very much in terms of his politics. But she does manage to find one area where Bush did a decent job when he was governor. That area is education, and it represents the one and only chapter in the book that has anything praiseworthy to say about GWB. Most everything else in the book is critical, with Ivins speaking her mind about Bush and his many failures, hoping that potential voters will read between the lines and realize that Bush isn't fit to govern.<br /><br />Ivins admits one thing about Bush in her book and she credits it for the president's success in spite of his endless string of failures: His skill as a politician. Bush may be incompetent as a leader and his policies may be worthy of criticism. But there is no denying that Bush knows how to play the game of politics better than most anyone else in government. How else does one explain his terrible track record and reconcile it with his political victories? It's an interesting phenomenon, and Ivins herself (like millions of other U.S. residents) is likely very puzzled by it.<br /><br />\\"Shrub\\" is, overall, a pretty good book with some humorous moments combined with a political expose on the current U.S. chief executive officer. This book leaves no stone unturned as it uncovers the many failures of George W. Bush, providing example after example of specific events, policy actions, and business practices relating to Bush and his politics, showing how he has failed at every turn and yet still managed to win in the majority of his political races.al victories?

They have to keep up with the latest changes in the laws that affect the way they handle employees and the way they administer benefits. This guide, updated each year since its initial release, is designed to help human resource personnel find the answers to legal questions.<br /><br />The most striking feature of this guide is its length. It is more than 1,100 pages long and contains 43 chapters. It needs to be this way, of course, to encompass all of the different laws pertaining to human resource management. It covers most everything about HR one can imagine, from rules and regulations regarding hiring and terminating to laws covering sexual harassment and pension administration.<br /><br />Even though this book is a very good resource, there are still a few things you will not be able to find. The primary function of this reference guide is to provide an overview of the federal laws. Thus, many of the laws unique to the individual states are not discussed here. There are a few exceptions, but there are many state- specific questions this guide will not be able to answer. This is what happened to me one day when I consulted this book for an answer regarding workmen's compensation. It didn't have what I needed to know about my state, so I had to look elsewhere. Still, it pointed me in the right direction so it did have its use.<br /><br />The organization of this book is ok, but some things about it are a little cumbersome. The table of contents, for example, doesn't include page numbers. Instead, it references the various pages based on the chapter number and the subsection (for example, \\"23.02\\" means turn to chapter 23, and then look for the second section). I think it would be better if it showed the page number.<br /><br />There are plenty of references in this guide to specific court cases, pointing out new decisions and how they were decided. Human Resource laws change all the time, which is why a book like this becomes outdated quickly. Fortunately, the author of this handy guide updates it every year with a new release. It's a large, bulky book that may not be organized in the most efficient way, but is still invaluable as reference guide for HR personnel.e, which is why a book like this becomes outdated quickly.

Elder caused quite a stir a few years back when he published a book titled \\"The Ten Things You Can't Say in America\\". In that book, he spoke plainly and directly about many controversial subjects such as racism, family, media bias, the welfare state, and gun control. In \\"Showdown\\", he basically talks about the same topics with some more facts and additional commentary on each.<br /><br />Elder feels that much is wrong with the political and social state we live in. He proposes several steps to remedy the negative situations and they all involve a return to personal freedom and the personal responsibility that goes with it. Elder feels we should rollback the welfare state and return to a nation where people are self- sufficient. He feels we should reject those individuals like Jesse Jackson who extort money from corporations using exaggerated and/or false claims of racism. He feels that a traditional two- parent family is important to the well- being of children. To sum it up, Elder takes a Libertarian stand on political and social issues and if you think in terms of liberty and personal responsibility, you should have no problem figuring out his positions on important issues without even opening this book.<br /><br />Much of this same material was covered in Elder's last book. But there is one thing that makes this book a little different and Elder mentions it throughout: The attacks of September 11, 2001. Elder feels that fighting terrorists is paramount to our survival as a nation and he feels we should fight with all our power to defeat those who commit these heinous acts. He doesn't specifically say what should be done; how to pay for it; or how to reconcile this \\"war\\" with his own principled stand on personal liberty. But you can tell that this event had had a profound impact on Elder, much like it did with other political commentators, because he makes mention of it many times as you read.<br /><br />Elder spends most of this book rehashing what he talked about in his last book, and this made the book a little less enjoyable than it otherwise would have been. I got a copy of Showdown and opened it up hoping for some new, fresh material complete with Elder's own pro- freedom diagnosis. Instead, the book touched on the same subjects that were discussed last time around, including racism, affirmative action, illegitimacy, gun rights, liberal media bias, etc. The only thing that was really different was the inclusion of the \\"war on terror\\" and how it has impacted the way we, as Americans, must now look at the world.<br /><br />Elder is libertarian, but in this book, his approach seems slightly different from that of a few years ago. Now, Elder's political stands seem more conservative- like he has moved in a southeasterly direction on the political Nolan chart and has found a new home bordering on right- conservative. He still criticizes Bush and other Republicans and he doesn't accept the socially conservative agendas of these and other political figures completely. But it's obvious that he is moving closer to the Republican Party and this has been confirmed by Elder's \\"after word\\" section in later releases of Showdown where he refers to himself as a Republican. I'm a little surprised that Elder would do this, considering the harsh words he has leveled against Republicans over the years. But I assume he felt that since he is more of a Republican than a Democrat, he might as well give in and choose one of the two major parties to call his home.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Showdown\\" is a good book, with many sensible solutions to the political and social problems that Americans face in the twenty- first century. It isn't quite as good or as fresh as Elder's \\"Ten Things you Can't Say in America\\", but this is still a good book to read for its commonsense analysis and its dry, often sarcastic wit. The book places an emphasis on liberty and responsibility, challenging Americans and their political leaders to reexamine they way they view the world and it makes a good choice for intellectual reading.sense analysis and its dry, often sarcastic wit.

It describes the different obstacles that individuals often face when they try to find fulfilling employment and explains different motivational techniques to overcome these barriers.<br /><br />This book is written as a self- help guide and it is complete with exercises that you can complete at home with a pen and piece of paper. These exercises ask you to list out things about yourself, like your ideal career lifestyle, or typical excuses you make that interfere with career changes. Then, following your writing exercise, the book will help you analyze what you have said and help you make your wishes reality.<br /><br />Besides the exercises, this book also contains plenty of quotations from people who have attended the author's self- help seminars. This is added so that you, the reader, can hear what other people have to say who are probably in the same predicament as you. They share their personal feelings on the problems they have encountered when trying to switch lifestyles and they hold nothing back. It provides a good dose of reality to the book.<br /><br />This book isn't a self- test type of book that tries to determine what type of career would suit your skills best. It is intended for those who already have a general idea what they want to do but are unsure how to overcome the mental obstacles, family pressures, financial concerns, and other problems that interfere with pursuing a major life change.<br /><br />I found the last few chapters of this book to be a little bit boring and repetitive, mainly because I already found out what I needed to know about myself in the earlier chapters, where I discovered that I am (what the author refers to as) a Scanner. The ending of the book didn't relate to my situation so there was little useful information to read. But for other individuals, this book could prove to be very handy if one is looking for that extra boost needed to stop talking and take action toward change. Like the book correctly points out, life is too short to wait. You need to figure out what you want to do with your life and proceed toward making it reality.n to read.

Author Timothy White knew Marley and his associates well and he has assembled many interesting facts about the musical artist in this excellent book.<br /><br />Besides the music, White covers details about Marley's personal life and his relationships with his family members. Most fans already know about wife Rita and their children- especially David \\"Ziggy\\" Marley who has made a name for himself as a reggae artist in his own right. But little is known about Marley's father and his other close relatives. White lets it all hang out in this book, explaining the quarrels, the arguments, and the special problems Marley faced with his family and his early life growing up in Kingston, Jamaica.<br /><br />Talking about Marley's life is the main theme of this book, but there is also a good deal of history. You learn all about the political history of Jamaica, the various leaders of the island nation, and Marley's political views and associations with them. Everyone knows that Marley's music was influenced heavily by the living conditions in his native land, and this book provides a solid background on the political situation that Marley considered so important.<br /><br />The writing in this book is a little different. Instead of translating the words to make it easier to follow, the author chose to use the same words that are common in Jamaican speaking. Jamaicans speak English, but they tend to shorten words and they don't like to pronounce the \\"th\\" sound. Thus, words like \\"them\\" and \\"that\\" are changed to \\"dem\\" and \\"dat\\". These words are the ones used in the book whenever someone from Jamaica is quoted. I like reading the actual words, but I know that some readers will be annoyed by this.<br /><br />This book is exhaustive, and White deserves credit for updating it every few years to keep it current. Even though Marley died in 1982, his music still sells well all over the world and there have been endless battles for rights to his estate; rights to publish his music; and other legal issues. Besides the legal battles, there are still controversies over Marley's death and the attempt on his life back in 1976. Many people suspect that the U.S. government was behind the assassination attempt, but no definitive proof exists one way or the other. White includes, at the end of the book, excerpts from court testimonies he has given about these and other important issues.<br /><br />This book is personal and concise, and it will thrill fans of the late singer as well as music fans in general. White deserves much credit for assembling together so much data and so many facts about this musical giant known as Bob Marley. The book is the best one available about the late singer and activist from the Caribbean region and it's a must for Marley fans everywhere.ls well all over the world and there have been endless battles for rights to his estate; rights to publish his music; and other legal issues.

Do you feel cheated when it comes to customer service? If you do, then you might enjoy this book about getting complete satisfaction when dealing with business. Whether it's a replacement for a defective product; a complimentary product or service; or a complete refund, this guide explains what to do for maximum customer benefit.<br /><br />The majority of businesses are ethical and provide good products and services, but there is always going to be the occasional exception. When things don't go the way they should, you need to take prompt action to get the situation remedied. This book emphasizes the importance of ASKING for what is due to you, as a customer. Businesses want customers to be happy, but they are not going to come to you when things don't work out. You must take the initiative and explain your dissatisfaction to the business. You will never get anywhere if you don't begin by asking.<br /><br />Besides the emphasis on asking, this book is loaded with examples of customer service mishaps, defective product encounters, and sloppy service experiences. In each instance, the book explains what was done to correct the problem and what results were achieved. In most every case, the business agreed to correct the problem in some way- either by replacing the product, offering a discount on a future visit, or giving a full refund.<br /><br />Most of what you read in this book is common sense and unless you don't have any skill dealing with people and customer service reps specifically, you will likely find only a small amount of value in this book. I found it to be ok, but nothing special since I already have gotten into the habit of speaking up with things go wrong.<br /><br />This book is a good motivational tool, if nothing else. The first step to achieving customer satisfaction is to ask for it. If you don't do this, you will never get what you want. And this book does a good job in the way it emphasizes the importance of asking. Don't settle for bad products or services. If you don't like what you got, ask the company to make it better.

Gene Simmons of the rock band KISS has quite a bit of information to share about his life experiences, and they are captured in this book, \\"Kiss and Make Up\\". Here, Simmons tells his life story from his early days growing up in Israel to his migration with his mother to the United States and ultimately to his rise to the top of the music world.<br /><br />Most people recognize Gene Simmons in his KISS make- up mask, disguised as the \\"Demon\\". Like Simmons points out in this book, he got the idea of this gimmick from his comic books, which often had superheroes who hid behind a mask. This seemed like a good idea for the band, so he went with it. He was proven correct, as the make- up (and Simmons long tongue) became the signature trade- marks of the band.<br /><br />Many fascinating things can be learned from this book. Besides the make- up and the decision to unmask in the early 1980's, Simmons shares many other facts about himself that few are aware. How many among us realize that Simmons was born in Israel and was originally named Chaim Witz? Or that his mother changed his name to Gene Klein when they moved to the U.S.? Or that Gene himself changed his last name to Simmons so that he would sound less ethnic? Or that all the original band members changed their names in one way or another? These and other facts can all be learned by reading this interesting book.<br /><br />Besides his information about the band and his relationships with the other members, Simmons also spends time talking about his personal relationships, like his time spent with Cher and his present marriage with Shannon Tweed. Simmons has two kids with Tweed and even though he fully admits that he never imagined himself married with children, now that this is reality, he cannot imagine life any other way.<br /><br />Gene Simmons, the flashy, womanizing bass player from KISS, has quite a story to tell about his rise to the top. And in this book, Simmons lays it all on the line for the world to see. Some readers will be shocked to learn the number of women Simmons has slept with. Others will be amazed to discover how he came to America and reached his goals to become a major rock star. Whatever your reaction, you will enjoy \\"Kiss and Make Up\\".

His mannerisms, his beliefs, and the things he sings about are bound to stir up strong emotional feelings from different people. If you've ever wondered about the life experiences that created the modern- day Marilyn Manson, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />Manson was born Brian Warner in Canton, Ohio, and his early years were spent doing typical boyish things. But the one experience Manson points out in this book that forever changed his life in a negative way was his attendance at Heritage Christian School. This \\"educational\\" private institution was run by staunch protestant fundamentalists and the administrators of the school were very strict, very brainwashing, and very intolerant. They told kids like young Brian Warner that, because he was a member of the Episcopal faith, he had no chance to get to heaven. This extremism led Warner to rebel, and he was never the same afterward.<br /><br />Manson talks about all sorts of other personal life experiences that had an important impact on his life. A neighbor guy once tried to molest him and he and his cousin discovered one day that their grandfather had a secret stash of adult films and women's clothing. These experiences, and the constant demonization of sex at his school, led Manson to become obsessed with topics like sex and religion, and they are mentioned continuously in this book.<br /><br />Besides his past (which keeps coming back to haunt him), Manson also spends time talking about his life as a rock and roller. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails is one of Manson's close confidants (the two had a falling out, but I think they are back to being friends again) and he has had personal relationships with other people and with plenty of women. He talks about living in Florida and the process that led to the formation of his band, showing the reader the long, hard road that must be plowed to reach the heights of the music world.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like too much about this book was the drawings of the human body and the diagrams that identify the parts. Not because they are nasty or anything like that, but because I didn't think they added much to the book. Also, at some points, I found the writing to be a little creepy. Manson talks very bluntly about sex, drugs, religion, etc., so you need to be prepared to hear some outspoken language. Some will find it shocking, while others will find it weird but also fascinating.<br /><br />Marilyn Manson is an unusual fellow for certain. But he is also an intelligent guy who offers some interesting perspectives on life. Many will not agree with everything he says, but some of his philosophical views will get you to think and re-think how you stand on these topics of controversy.e thing I didn't like too much about this book was the drawings of the human body and the diagrams that identify the parts.

He still sells out every venue where he schedules a stop on his annual tours. He has legions of loyal \\"Parrothead\\" followers who think he's the greatest man on the planet. He has a solid family life and has everything he wants, thanks to the lucrative business in which he works.<br /><br />But in spite of all this, there is one thing Buffett cannot escape: the inevitable fact of growing old. He wrote this book to commemorate his fiftieth birthday- a birthday that was celebrated by taking a three- week trip from Florida, through the Caribbean, the northern areas of South America, back through the Caribbean, and then returning to Florida. Buffett enjoys travel, warm waters, and deep sea fishing and this seemed like the perfect way to celebrate his fiftieth birthday.<br /><br />Buffett spends most of this book talking about this trip but interwoven within you will find pieces of information relating to his life story and his struggles and success in music and in life. Buffett talks about his college years; how he became interested in music (he says a major factor was to meet more women); how he worked to find his musical niche; and how he now balances family and professional life.<br /><br />One thing I noticed about this book is that Buffett has some very good creative talent as a writer. He can take the most mundane subject and make it seem interesting by the colorful way he describes it. I haven't read any of Buffett's fictional books, but I would surmise they are probably very good and very creative. He's one of those people who can write in an entertaining way about any topic.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good book from Buffett and it's a must- read for Parrotheads. I would have liked it even better if there was more to read about Buffett's personal experiences and not so much about his three- week jaunt in the lower latitudes. But on the other hand, the book was inspired by Buffett's turning 50 years old, so the travel adventures have to be covered and should be expected. It all makes for some good reading material from this great musical talent from Mobile, Alabama.rs old, so the travel adventures have to be covered and should be expected.

That is the main question presented in this book by Jim Hightower. Politicians, it seems, are no longer responsive to the needs of the people and have now placed money and power over principle. In this book, Jim Hightower discusses the problems presented by greedy CEO's and the corrupt politicians who happily accept their cash and he mostly succeeds at presenting a good piece of reading material, full of good thinking points and plenty of humor.<br /><br />Some of Hightower's viewpoints will not resonate well with every reader, since his positions are almost entirely of the liberal persuasion, but he does have a few good points to make. Hightower attacks corporations for spreading their culture of greed into small towns across the land. He criticizes companies and government officials for not doing more to protect the environment. And, more than anything else, he blasts the Bush administration for its numerous failed policies. He feels that George W. Bush is the root of all evil and that we, the people, need to do all we can to minimize the negative effects of his presidency.<br /><br />This book succeeds in some areas and fails in others. Hightower is definitely correct when he points out how politicians are quickly selling out to corporate donors in return for some quick and easy campaign money. He is also correct when he points out the many failings of government, like the disastrous war on drugs and the many invasions of privacy that our government commits every day, mostly in the name of fighting terrorists. But in other areas, Hightower's views seem a little tainted. He holds democracy to the highest level, but where would he draw the line in his political thinking? Don't individuals need to have some rights to protect against the wishes of the majority? Hightower doesn't say much about this. He seems to think that whatever benefits the most people is the way to go.<br /><br />One other thing you should know about this book is that it doesn't provide very much intellectual analysis to back its claims. Hightower seems to think that, since his position is the correct one, he doesn't need to do much else to persuade the reader. It would be helpful- not to mention more convincing- if Hightower would present some analysis to back his positions.<br /><br />Corporations exert quite a bit of influence on politics. But is the power they wield greater than it should be? In the opinion of Jim Hightower, the answer is yes, it is. Hightower feels that everyone should get off their behinds and work in support for populist causes and populist candidates for office. Inaction is the greatest sin of all, and everyone needs to work for change if they want to rid the U.S. of excessive corporate influence and return the country to the rule of the people.bout this book is that it doesn't provide very much intellectual analysis to back its claims.

He co- founded Cigars Around the World and he was a real estate developer before he made his television appearance on the Apprentice- an event that landed him a prestigious position in the Trump organization. \\"You're Hired\\", Rancic's first writing effort, is a business book that details Bill's money making adventures from frying pancakes on a griddle and selling them to his grandmother's friends all the way to his present stint as Trump's main man in Chicago.<br /><br />This book is not really a biography and you shouldn't approach it with the hope of discovering lots of Rancic family facts or Bill's personal feelings on the meaning of life. This is a business book and while Bill does make mention of his family and how their support has contributed to his success, he devotes most of the book to the business of business, explaining the principles that have guided him along the way.<br /><br />As far as the tips and advice go, this book is pretty average overall. Each chapter ends with a listing of tips compiled by Bill and I can agree that most of them are useful and they all make practical sense. But what they lack is the \\"wow\\" factor. There is nothing really profound or memorable among them; nothing that would make you step back and think about the meaning of what was just stated. The tips for success that Bill presents are common sense, and if you read many business books, you have likely already heard this type of advice before.<br /><br />One thing that is worth mentioning here is the actual writing of the book, because it is something that will bother certain readers. Bill writes this book in a direct manner, and there is nothing wrong with that. But the book is loaded with run- on sentences, sentence fragments, and other grammatical errors. I can forgive this to an extent because I was still able to understand what Rancic was trying to say. But some people will be turned- off by this oversight and will wonder what Bill was thinking when he decided to publish a book with so many writing mistakes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good book, and it provides some good insight for those who have an interest in business and want to learn the ropes from a guy who has achieved a good deal of success at a young age. However, the majority of the advice given here is obvious and I didn't come away from my reading with any new ideas or with a feeling that I just discovered something incredible. It's a decent book to read and it can be completed in a short period of time, but don't expect to get any goose bumps as you skim through these words of wisdom by Donald Trump's apprentice.le to understand what Rancic was trying to say.

In some ways, it is a reference guide and this is how most people will approach it. But in other ways, this book also presents some good reading material, particularly in the first few chapters where the author talks about the role of dogs in history.<br /><br />The longest part of this book is chapter five, where each dog breed is pictured and profiled. Here, you can learn some new facts about specific breeds, like the reason they were initially bred, along with more common facts, like the average height and weight for each.<br /><br />There are a couple of things about this guide that are not the best. First of all, the fifth chapter- the one with all the dog breeds- isn't very well organized. It contains too many categories for dogs (scent hounds, sight hounds, gun dogs, etc.) and this can make it difficult to find a specific breed. In many instances, you are better off just looking up the breed name in the index.<br /><br />The other thing about this guide that makes it incomplete is the limited information contained in the final chapter about dog care. In this chapter, there is a brief discussion of topics like health, nutrition, traveling with dogs, selecting the right breed, and so on. This is important information to know, but the author devotes only two pages to each of these areas. This isn't nearly enough for topics as important as these.<br /><br />Still, this encyclopedia is a good reference guide for those who want to know more about dogs, both past and present. It makes a good resource to consult for finding facts about specific breeds and for learning more about the dog's physical structure, history, and various roles as hunter, worker, and family friend.	2005-02-03

It provides a good reference book for those who want to lookup facts and discover trivia about beer and the art of brewing; tasting and evaluation; cooking with beer; home brewing; and other topics.<br /><br />The authors of this book write in a very matter of fact style. They use bulleted text, shaded boxes, and other eye- grabbing techniques throughout, making the book look like the layout of a long advertising piece. Plenty of lists and trivial facts can be found throughout the pages of the book, and the authors seem very interested in increasing your beer I.Q.<br /><br />Some sections of this book probably deserve a little more coverage then they receive. Prohibition, one of the ugliest events in world history, receives less than one page of discussion. I guess the authors felt this wasn't significant to the modern- day enjoyment and understanding of malt beverages so they limited its allotted space.<br /><br />This makes a good reference book for anyone who wants to know more about beer. Whether you're a novice or a seasoned veteran in the world of malt beverages, this guide will prove to be fun and educational.	2005-02-03

The author's name is Jeffrey Masson and he is a dog lover extraordinaire- a man who thinks the world of his dogs and wants to share with everyone on the planet what he feels he knows about canine thinking.<br /><br />Masson spends his time in this book talking about his three dogs and explaining the behavior he has observed in each of them. He talks about how his dogs react to different people and different situations. He presents examples of canine loyalty and heroics from known events in the past. This all makes for some pleasant enough reading, even though it gets a little repetitive after a while.<br /><br />One thing that makes this book a little less valuable than it might otherwise be is the author's lack of any scientific research to back up its claims. Masson really likes dogs and he feels pretty certain that his observations bear some resemblance to absolute truth. But he offers nothing to back up his claims. He only offers observations, without any scientific or original research to prove himself.<br /><br />Masson gets sappy from time to time in this book, so be prepared to read about his dogs giving him kisses, sleeping at the foot of the bed, showing their uncontrolled enthusiasm when he gets home, etc. It's easy to see that Masson is a lover of dogs, but his book is only average. I can relate to how he feels about our canine friends, but in the absence of any scientific experiments or original research, this book is only half as good as it could have been.	2005-01-28

When most people think about investing in real estate, they conjure up visions of expensive condominiums, high- rise luxury apartments, and huge houses with thousands of square footage. We automatically put our guard into place when someone mentions real estate because we think it takes large amounts of wealth to succeed. But as author Dan Auito demonstrates in this book, real estate investing is not strictly a rich person's game. It is a career field that is within the grasp of ordinary people and success can be achieved with a minimal amount of money.<br /><br />With this book as your guide, a novice investor can quickly learn the necessary skills to succeed in the real estate field. Auito shows, in simple, easy to understand language, exactly what needs to be done to succeed in real estate. He walks the reader through the steps, showing how to buy, sell, and appraise property; how to rehabilitate a property for maximum resale value; how to look for good tenants in the case of rental property; and many other important tips. He organizes the book very nicely, using a dark bullet in front of the text when an important topic needs to be stressed and lighter colored bullets to display a checklist of some sort.<br /><br />To get the new student of real estate thinking about important ideas and putting these ideas on paper, the author has a page of lined text at the end of each chapter with sections titled \\"Notes- insights, ideas, actions to take\\"; \\"Strategy- planning for success\\"; and \\"Tactics- ways to achieve success\\".  This is a nice addition to the book because it gives readers a place to jot down their thoughts about real estate investing, making the book like a combination of a learning guide and a workbook.<br /><br />Auito uses a direct, tell- it- like- it- is approach to his writing. He doesn't beat around the bush when he discusses legal concerns, financing, negotiating a deal, or anything else. He lets you know, in a direct fashion, exactly what it takes to succeed in this business. It will require a good amount of time, preparation, and effort and the author makes no excuses for this. He lets you know ahead of time before you set out to purchase your first investment property.<br /><br />I like the organization of this book and I like the fact that it covers topics that many might not think about. The obvious real estate factors, like the importance of a good location and the different types of financing, are mentioned like they should be. But what is also discussed are topics that many may not be aware, like seeking out legal advice from an attorney before signing contracts and entering into deals; purchasing and selling real estate without using a broker to save money on commissions; finding the best possible tenants for your rental property; etc. These and other important considerations are discussed in the book.<br /><br />Auito has an interesting chapter in his book where he briefly compares real estate investment with stock market investments. It's not surprising that the author prefers real estate over the stock market. He is correct that real estate is generally much safer than investing in common stocks. And while it's true that stocks have the potential to return much more than real estate, they also have the potential to decline in value. This is something that rarely, if ever, happens with real estate property. The value almost always increases and there is a potential for cash flow (in the case of rental property), as well as certain tax advantages with real estate, making it a safe and solid investment.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, this is a very good guide for making money through real estate investing. Auito makes everything look easy, even though he admits that real estate takes time, effort, and planning. With the right preparation, real estate can prove to be a lucrative and enjoyable way tomake money. And with Dan Auito's book as your guide, you will be well on your way to making a good living in this mostly safe, fun, and friendly field of investment.make money.

Author Sam Harris is a philosopher and a religious critic who feels that belief in a higher being and the whole notion of organized religion is detrimental to the good of society. He feels we would be better off with no religion and he makes his case for the \\"End of Faith\\" in this book. Harris feels that religion is the root cause of much of the world's evil and that most of the fighting that takes place in the world would be gone if religion took an exit from society.<br /><br />Harris isn't too fond of any religion but he is most critical of Islam. To Harris, Islam poses a grave and immediate threat and he points to the attacks on September 11, 2001 and to the actual scripture of the Koran as proof of his opinion. Terrorism is a serious issue, and according to the book, Islam is not compatible with a free and rationally- functioning world. The book also attacks religious moderates, whom the author feels are nothing more than fundamentalists in the making, since most every religion has radical beliefs at its core.<br /><br />I can understand where the book is coming from in some instances. I can agree that fundamentalists of all faiths are a menace to society and I like the fact that the author chose to include actual quotations taken directly from the holy books of the world to prove his point. But I think his negativity toward religion in general is just as extreme as the devotedly religious people he so deplores. The book makes no effort at all to see the positive side of religion. It doesn't take into account the charitable acts, the positive ethics, and the sense of community that some religions bring to society. They are all dismissed as obstacles to human development at best, and perpetrators of terrorism at worst.<br /><br />Eliminating religion would not wipe out the force of evil. The book doesn't go quite this far in its discussion, but it comes very close. As much as these terrorists of recent years have strong allegiances to religion, there is no mention in the book of the fact that leaders like Stalin and Mao Tse- Tung were responsible for millions of deaths and were not religious in any way. I think the book gets a little carried away in this regard when it tries to pretend that evil will mostly disappear if religious faith was a thing of the past. Concentrated political power is just as large a threat- if not more so- than religious extremism.<br /><br />This book is written in a very intellectual way and it contains plenty of references to back its claims. I don't necessarily believe in everything this book preaches about religion and its supposed detrimental effects on society. But I do respect the author's point of view, and even though I disagree with some of his conclusions, I feel this is a good book to read by those who have an interest in philosophy and religion and who like to tackle controversial subjects.on in the book of the fact that leaders like Stalin and Mao Tse- Tung were responsible for millions of deaths and were not religious in any way.

Most are happy that their man, George W. Bush, won the office of the presidency. But many are disturbed at the direction the party is headed and would like to see a return to more traditional roots.<br /><br />One man who doesn't like what he sees is Pat Buchanan. He is dismayed at the \\"neo- conservative\\" movement that has taken over his old political party. He doesn't like the reckless spending, the soaring budget deficits, and the new philosophy of imperialism. His concerns inspired him to write this book, giving Buchanan the opportunity to examine some of these new policies and explain why they are wrong for the Republican Party and wrong for America.<br /><br />Buchanan talks about the war against Iraq, the \\"war on terror\\", the threat from China, economic problems at home, and the excessive power of judges to control our lives. In each of these areas, Buchanan argues against the current Republican establishment, showing how the policies the neo-cons are enacting are going to lead to financial crises, military exhaustion, and a decline in personal freedoms. He argues well for his points, citing countless statistics on the matter and making some good, intellectual insights into domestic and foreign affairs.<br /><br />I like Buchanan's persuasive writing, and I appreciate the fact that he has the guts to take on the party he once called home. This is something rarely seen in modern- day politics, with all the kowtowing that takes place every day among Repubs and Dems, and it makes for some refreshing reading. The only complaint I have with this book is that Buchanan seems a little bit paranoid and excessively worried about the future. I can understand his concerns, but the way he writes and the way he explains things, you get the feeling the planet earth is going to implode at any moment. No one will know if Buchanan is right or not until many years into the future. But I think his negative attitude goes a little overboard at times.<br /><br />Regardless of paranoid Pat's personal views, I still think this is a very good book. I don't agree with everything Buchanan has to say, and I'm certain that other readers will feel the same way. But this book is still worth a look, just to read about the failures of the Republican Party and the embracing of the \\"big government\\" philosophy that George W. Bush and his fellow neo- cons have undertaken in the past few years.tive attitude goes a little overboard at times.<br /><br />Regardless of paranoid Pat's personal views, I still think this is a very good book.

Most everyone who uses a personal computer has questions from time to time about its operating system. Even advanced users need some assistance with troubleshooting, and everyone can use a little additional training every once and a while. This reference guide offers both how- to advice on correcting problems and general guidance to help Windows 2000 users better understand the system.<br /><br />One thing that makes this book a little different from others is the format. It includes bulleted text, screen shots, and other symbols that are typical of a reference book. But it also includes a good amount of reading material to supplement the screen shots and the reference- style text. In this regard, this book is like a study guide, which makes it more useful than other reference books that step you through things but don't explain as well as they should.<br /><br />I think this guide could be even better if it included more advanced techniques. There is some material about advanced topics, like one would expect with a book that claims it is supposed to help you \\"master\\" the subject. But the majority of the guide is for beginners and intermediate students of Windows 2000.<br /><br />Many reference books exist for users of Windows 2000 and other operating systems, so this guide is not alone. But I think the combined approach of reference book and reading book makes this one of the better guides on the market for understanding and utilizing Windows 2000.	2004-12-18

I know the Windows 2000 system pretty well, but I was still surprised by some of the information contained in this guide. There are features of Windows 2000 that I never knew existed until I read this book.<br /><br />The pages of this guide include bullets, boldface text, screen shots, and other things you associate with a reference book. In the left- hand margin of each page, the book includes symbols that make it easy to find a particular reference point. Tips are designated by a light bulb, \\"secrets\\" are shown with a padlock, general notes are highlighted with a notebook and pen, etc. This makes it quick and easy to find these important highlights as you scan down each page.<br /><br />This book would probably be a little better if it further expanded on some of the key topics and if it included even more screen shots to go with the user- friendly outline format. But this is still a very good reference guide regardless. It can help educate new users and it can show more advanced users some important ways to enhance their Windows 2000 operating system so that they can get the most out of it. There is a lot to be discovered with Windows 2000, and this guide helps lead the way to a better understanding.	2004-12-13

Its Word, Excel, Power Point, and other products are known the world over, and knowledge of these applications is essential for anyone working in business. If you use Office XP and have questions about using any one of these products, then this reference guide is a must for your home or office. With a length of almost 1,600 pages (!), this is possibly the longest guide of its kind in print today.<br /><br />This book covers Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook, Access, FrontPage, and Publisher. Most everyone is familiar with Word and Excel, and a large percentage of the population uses Outlook. These sections are the ones I turn to with the greatest frequency because they are great for troubleshooting and they are excellent for learning more about each one of these applications.<br /><br />The sections on FrontPage, Power Point, Publisher, and Access are not quite as long, but they present some very useful information about these applications. I had never heard much about FrontPage or Publisher until I discovered them in this guide.<br /><br />Like the other books in the \\"Inside Out\\" series, this one makes great use of screen shots to illustrate key points. It's one thing to read about an enhancement to an application, but it's another thing entirely to actually see how it will look on your screen. For example, chapter twenty- nine has a section on using Excel for advanced business analysis- a subject that can be intimidating to some. But this guide makes it all look easy with its constant use of snapshots, showing exactly what your spreadsheet will look like as you type in various commands.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent reference material for users of Microsoft Office XP. Many guides exist for looking up tips and for troubleshooting, but the \\"Inside Out\\" series is the best.

If so, then this guide is the one for you. It contains thousands of tips, tricks, and solutions to problems relating to the Windows XP operating system and it can help to expand your level of knowledge by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />This reference book has three clear advantages: the overall length of the guide, the organization, and the format. First of all, the length is more than 1,200 pages, which is enough to cover a multitude of issues. Second, the organization is superior, with nine main section and black and blue colored tabs that help a user to find specific sections quickly. Third, the format is very helpful. Not only is the outline format easy to follow and learn from, the use of screen shots makes a tremendous difference by illustrating exactly what you can expect to see if you attempt one of the commands.<br /><br />A book this large can get a little bulky to handle, but it contains so many useful tips and advice that you will likely have no problem overlooking this one small flaw. A person who is brand new to Windows XP can learn all about how the system works by using this guide, and a more advanced user can find out ways to do things that are simple and more efficient. I particularly liked the sections that cover managing and finding folders and different ways to use and manage the Windows explorer.

But the actions of some are so incredibly mindless that they boggle the imagination. With some people, the supreme acts of stupidity they have committed has either led to their demise or to the inability to spread their tainted cells to future generations via reproduction. Those who have succumbed to stupidity in this manner are proud recipients of a Darwin Award, named after Charles Darwin, the father of the theory of evolution and natural selection.<br /><br />This book divides it winning entries into those that have been confirmed, those that are honorable mentions, and those that have been proven to be urban legends. Confirmed entries have been verified as true. Honorable mentions are given to individuals who committed gross acts of stupidity but didn't actually die or lose the ability to reproduce. .And urban legends are those stories which are known to be false but have been included in this book anyway because so many people believe them to be true.<br /><br />The humor used in this guide is a little bit on the morbid side, and this fact could turn some readers off. The book talks about these people and the things they did and, in many cases, it seems to be making fun of the incident, even when people died as a result. It is all meant in good fun, but it could be objectionable to more sensitive readers.<br /><br />As far as the stories themselves go, I found that many of them are quite humorous, particularly those that involve a man's private parts. It's shocking to read some of the outrageous things than men will do in order to get off. Some can be chalked up as lapses in judgment, but others are so weird they defy any sense of rationalization. (...)<br />A book like this may not be to everyone's liking, both for its callous sense of humor and for the briefness of many of the entries. No story is more than two pages long and some are only a single paragraph. This isn't always enough to adequately describe an event thoroughly. Still, this book is a pretty good one, filled with plenty of funny incidents of natural selection taking place, adding proof to Darwin's theory that less intelligent members of society are gradually eliminated from the gene pool each and every day.isn't always enough to adequately describe an event thoroughly.

American history is often ranked by high school students as one of their least favorite courses. Even in college, very few students take a course in history unless it's a requirement for graduation. The subject of U.S. history is often criticized for being boring and even sleep- inducing by people of all ages.<br /><br />Author James Loewen feels one of the main reasons for the dislike of history is the way it is presented in textbooks. In this book, he points out the many falsehoods that are commonly printed in our American history books. American history, at the high school level, has to be taught (according to school boards and others in charge) in a non- offensive way. There is also pressure from certain groups to make leaders of the past into larger than life heroes and to avoid most any form of negativity. This is why our American history textbooks are often so bland and why students have such a difficult time finding anything interesting to say about this subject.<br /><br />Christopher Columbus, the Pilgrims, and the early American founders are among the many topics covered in this book. Loewen shows how and why these and other topics are often misrepresented in our children's classrooms. In an effort to remain as politically correct as possible, most anything of a controversial nature or anything that makes the United States look bad is purged from the text. Only at the college level is this trend reversed but according to Loewen, by this time, students are usually so turned off that they don't want to take another history class again.<br /><br />Most of the pages of this book are spent debunking old myths about history and explaining the brutal way that Native Americans and African American were often treated in the past. The reason Loewen emphasizes these areas so much is because virtually nothing is said about them in high school textbooks. Again, the people in charge feel that this type of information makes the United States look bad and tarnishes the images of our leaders. Thus, they delete most any mention of these topics from the books.<br /><br />This book is a pretty good one, but the discussions will bother traditionalists and others who would rather live in a fantasy world and pretend that these things never took place and that the United States government is perfect in every way. But for the rest of us, this is an enjoyable read that gets you to re-think what you were told in high school history class as you fought the urge to doze off.mages of our leaders.

This book presents a listing of ninety- five historic sites, historic parks, and historic markers that don't quite get the story correct. Arranged in the book from west to east, each state in the U.S. includes at least one listing and some states have several. They all have one thing in common: They either lie outright or they present misleading information about what took place.<br /><br />Even though this book is titled \\"Lies Across America\\" the truth is that most of the places presented in this book are not necessarily giving out false information to tourists. Rather, they are failing to tell both sides of the story. The themes most commonly mentioned in the passages of this book are those that de-emphasize the role of Native Americans in the settling of the North American continent; fail to mention the bad treatment of African Americans; or that fail to tell the truth about the role of the Confederate and Union leaders in the Civil War. These historic places tend to explain things in a mostly positive way, leaving out anything bad in order to make people feel better about a person or place or to avoid controversy.<br /><br />Loewen has some interesting facts to share about different historic sites around the country, and some of the things you will read in this book will surprise you. He feels that the negative and/or controversial facts, even if they don't sound good, should still be presented in their entirety. Historic sites shouldn't try to hide the truth- they should let the facts be known to all.<br /><br />This book presents some good history lessons about some of the forgotten moments in U.S. history. Loewen writes in a clear manner, but I really wish he would refrain from using so many exclamation marks. On most every page of this book, he has an exclamation mark someplace. Maybe he is just so fascinated with his own work that he can't help himself. But I really wish he would refrain from his tendency to shout.<br /><br />History majors and other lovers of the past will enjoy this book most. It does get a little carried away with topics about the Civil War and coverage of oppressed groups of people. But I still think it's a good book with some important information for all to read. What we hear is not always the full truth, and Loewen wants this to change.that he can't help himself.

Bush employs large numbers of people to manage his public relations. Like other U.S. presidents, he is prone to twisting the truth every now and then to sell his ideas to the people. In this book, the founders of the web site spinsanity.com talk about the president's use of political spin, why they feel his particular style of spin is particularly toxic, and why we need to demand change.<br /><br />Every president, and most people in politics, are natural born liars. But as this book explains, Bush is a new breed of liar and his style of lying is more dangerous. Most people already know about the more common Bush fibs, like the ones about the weapons of mass destruction charge and the ones about his tax cuts and how they would help the middle and lower classes. Lying is nothing new in politics, but Bush is unique, in the minds of these authors, because 1. He never admits lying, even when the truth is uncovered. He will even change his initial story to cover up his lie and 2. He continues to go around preaching to the people about his supposed honesty. All of this is done to cover his tracks and make the people think he's telling the truth.<br /><br />How does Bush get away with this? Well, according to this book, he gets away with it primarily because the media is too soft on him. Reporters are worried about taking a stand against the president and calling him on his frequent lies for several reasons. First of all, because they don't want to be labeled as biased. Second, because they are worried that, if they go against certain programs and actions, like the war against Iraq, they will be labeled as unpatriotic and un- American. Their desire to remain objective prevents them from criticizing what Bush tells them. And this lack of criticism, indirectly, makes the public think that the falsehoods are actually true.<br /><br />This book covers Bush's lies from his days when he first ran for president all the way to the election of 2004. The authors make brief mention of other politicians and their lies, like John Kerry and a few others. But they don't say very much about these people. They stick to the main subject of the book, George W. Bush, from beginning to end.<br /><br />I found this book to be fairly good overall, but it's not quite the inspirational piece of literature I had hoped it would be. I already knew it was going to be biased, based on its title alone. But I was hoping to discover some new facts about president Bush and his penchant for not telling the truth. Unfortunately for me, I didn't gain any new insight. Most of the material presented here has already been published many times before. So, unless you're brand- new to the topic of Bush and his spin team, you will likely not find much in a book like this one. However, for newcomers to the world of political lying, this book is a good place to start. It breaks down some of the more common Bush lies, with quotations and sources to back up its claims, showing how Bush and his administration shamelessly spout off one lie after under while continuing to hide under the banner of morality.make brief mention of other politicians and their lies, like John Kerry and a few others.

What are some of the most interesting places to visit in the world? Countless authors, magazine editors, and travel professionals have tried to answer this question. Usually, they come up with a listing based on surveys and sometimes, they are based strictly on one individual's personal opinion. This book uses the latter method, describing 1,000 interesting places to see around the globe.<br /><br />Unlike other \\"lists\\" about travel, this book doesn't necessarily claim that the places included are the best in the world. Instead, the book includes all sorts of places, from well- known tourist spots like Paris, France, to little known hideaways in Canada. I'm not sure what type of methodology, if any, was used for this book. But it is clear that these are not necessarily the greatest places to visit.<br /><br />Besides actual places, this guide also includes events worthy of considering on your next vacation trip, like Munich Germany's Oktoberfest, for example. By adding events to the mix, this book is likely to accommodate a wider array of travelers. And it also means that the book is likely to include something from most every state and many regions of the world.<br /><br />There is much to see in the great, big world we live in. Everyone knows about such popular tourist spots as the Grand Canyon, Ayers Rock, the Great Wall of China, and others. But for a glimpse of lesser- known places that are still unique and interesting, this book makes a good choice for reading material. It includes places off the beaten path that may not rake in millions in tourist dollars, but still have something interesting to offer.	2004-10-29

There is no plan for starting your own business, obtaining financing, or anything else that one would normally associate with business ownership and the growth of wealth. Instead, this book focuses on management. It explains what it takes to effectively handle people; how to handle raises and promotions; how to reduce your stress in the workplace; etc.<br /><br />Donald Trump has always been a popular figure for many reasons, like his success in business, his arrogance, and his love of beautiful women, just to name a few. His television show, The Apprentice, was a runaway hit in its debut on network television and because of this, much space in the book is dedicated to the show and the many personalities who helped make the show such a hit with viewers. I enjoy the show, but I think there is a little too much emphasis on the Apprentice in this book. Readers who buy this book will likely do so thinking it's a book about money and wealth attainment. They don't necessarily care about things like the contestants who appeared on the Apprentice.<br /><br />This book, despite its frequent sidetracks, does deliver in many ways. It offers some good words of advice about management, even though some of them are obvious. And it comes from a man who has made a name for himself in real estate and management, so you know the advice isn't just a bunch of hot air or unproven theory. It's advice that has been tested over and over again by America's favorite billionaire, making this guide a decent place for students of management and business owners to turn for some simple to read and easy to understand words of wisdom.h of hot air or unproven theory.

Bush and his son, President George W. Bush, are two well- known members of the Bush family, thanks to their ascendance to the highest office in the land. The pathway to the top of the American political world began quite some time ago for the Bushes, and it is the main subject of this book by Kevin Phillips.<br /><br />Phillips writes this book with a skeptical eye, focusing first on the characteristics of a family dynasty and how this can have detrimental effects on democracy. The two Bush presidents are not the first father- son team to both reach the Oval Office- that honor belongs to John Adams and John Quincy Adams. But the author feels that modern- day circumstances make the idea of a family presidential dynasty more of a threat today than in the past. I found this part of the book the least convincing. I respect Phillips as an author and I appreciate the fact that he doesn't resort to name- calling and other immature antics to degrade the Bush family and drive his point home. But I don't necessarily agree that having multiple family members reach the highest office in the land is a bad idea and a threat to democracy. Phillips tries to build a case for this, but I am not convinced this really matters.<br /><br />When Phillips isn't talking directly about the Bush family's ties to royalty and similarities to a family of ruling kings, he is instead focusing on other realities of George W. Bush's personality and how these traits could have negative consequences to the American people. The chapter on the rise of the religious right, for example, is one such area where the author talks about  some of the strong influences on Bush's political ideology and it is a very good chapter. It is known that Bush often consults with religious leaders for advice on public policy and foreign affairs, and Phillips feels this should be cause for alarm. I can agree that this is a little unsettling. Other presidents have relied on experts in their respective fields to guide public policy decisions. Bush, on the other hand, often turns to religious leadership, completely ignoring the idea that church and state are better off if kept separate.<br /><br />Another area where the Bushes have allowed special interests to have a strong influence on policy is in corporate relations. We all know about Enron Corporation and the friendship between Bush and former Enron CEO Ken Lay. And most of us know about vice- president Dick Cheney and his ties to Halliburton Corp. But these are only the tip of the iceberg, as Phillips points out. The truth is that the Bush family has been involved in business for a long time and has been known to scratch the backs of those in power at different corporations in exchange for political favors and contributions. This is nothing new in the world of politics, but Bush seems to involve himself in corporate activities more than other presidents.<br /><br />Bush family politics, and the deceitful way the family has projected itself to the public, is an interesting subject matter. The fact that two Bush family members have managed to win the office as U.S. president shows that the ancestors' hard work has paid off. Along the way, however, the Bush's have gotten themselves wrapped up in oil, big business interests, the religious right, and the military establishment. \\"American Dynasty\\" explains how this all started and where we are headed, as a nation, if this type of \\"dynastization\\" continues into the future. I don't agree with everything the author says, but his intellectualism is compelling and he does present some solid analysis of the Bush family and its rise to the top of the political field.uide public policy decisions.

The authors of this book feel they have the answer. They include 37 short chapters on how to have your way with women and how to keep them coming back for more.<br /><br />Much of what is written in this book is old news, and the majority of the tips given are obvious. Do I really need a handbook to tell me that expulsion of gas from a man's body, while in the company of woman, is a bad idea and could turn her off? Do I need someone to tell me that dating can get expensive; that wearing condoms is a very good idea; and that I should never physically hit a woman? This all sounds pretty basic to me.<br /><br />On the other hand, the authors of this book do manage to present some good, solid advice that some men- especially younger ones- may not be aware. For example, one of the chapters talks about not treating a woman as a buddy and avoiding answering questions and taking on the role of a therapist. If you want a woman to look at you in a romantic way, you need to let this be known to her immediately. Once she looks at you as a friend, there is very little chance for a sexual relationship later on because, among other things, she won't want to spoil the friendship. I have seen men fall into this trap many times, and they often cannot figure out why the woman doesn't look at them in a romantic way. This is one area where the author's seem to hit the nail on the head. They are also correct when they explain how important it is to maintain one's self respect by never groveling for sex. And they are correct when they point out that there are plenty of women available to start a relationship with (women outnumber men in the world) and a man should never develop the attitude that he will never meet another woman. This is false, and it can easily lead to missed opportunities.<br /><br />Overall, though, this book is pretty lame and not very useful except to the most desperate men among us who can't seem to get anything going with women and want to make a change that will improve their sex lives. Most readers will find this book slightly humorous, but limited in usefulness. There just isn't much originality in this guide. It should be viewed mainly as a novelty book; good for a few laughs, but not meant to be taken that seriously.men among us who can't seem to get anything going with women and want to make a change that will improve their sex lives.

He was born to his recently- widowed mother in the 1940's and never knew his biological father. The male figure in this young life was his step father, Roger Clinton- a man who was an alcoholic and often prone to emotional outbursts. His roots were lower- middle class, yet he still achieved success in spite of the tremendous obstacles thrown into his path.<br /><br />Clinton tells all about his life in this book, and parts of it are fascinating to read. Most people know the Bill Clinton who became president and was embroiled in numerous political and personal scandals. But few know about Clinton's early days, growing up in the state of Arkansas; attending Georgetown University; Going to Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship; Running unsuccessfully for state rep from Arkansas; and winning election as governor of his home state. These, and many other stories are detailed in this book, with some facts that will raise your eyebrows on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Clinton's presidency was overrun with scandal, and this area of his life is given much coverage in the book. On thing that I didn't like about Clinton's approach to these scandals is that he basically declares himself completely innocent of everything. Granted, I expected this when I started to read the last part of the book. But I was still hoping that maybe, just maybe, Clinton would tell the book reading world something shocking and admit to responsibility for some of these widely- publicized events. He never does, maintaining that it was his many enemies who set him up, tried to intimidate those close to him, and ultimately tried to bring him down.<br /><br />Clinton's presidency was marked with some successes, and Clinton highlights these in his writing. I found it interesting how obsessed he seems to be with the terrorist issue. On page after page, he keeps coming back to the problem of terrorism and he quickly points out the progress he thinks he made on stopping these people and organizations whose intent is to threaten and kill innocent people and force their narrow agenda on the world. When I counted the number of times he mentioned terrorists, it made me a little suspicious. Could it be that Clinton feels a little bit guilty and a little bit responsible for not doing more to stop the people who were ultimately responsible for the attacks on September 11, 2001? I started to wonder about this as I turned the pages. An occasional mention here and there would be normal, but it seems like Clinton touches on this issue too many times to be an accident. It seems like he had other motives when he decided to refer back to this problem so many times as he writes.<br /><br />If you like your books short and simple, then you might want to pass on reading \\"My Life\\". This is the longest autobiography I have ever read, and it took me about one and a half months to finish it. The first part of the book was the most enjoyable, mainly because it included facts about Bill Clinton that I had never heard of before. The last one- third of the book (the parts that cover the presidency) are more predictable and less interesting because they say exactly what everyone already knows and they state exactly what you expect the former president to profess. Clinton doesn't offer any real surprises here. He blames others for all the problems and all the distractions he experienced while in the oval office.<br /><br />In spite of some flaws, I still recommend reading this book. Many people resent Bill Clinton for his policies and for his personal actions and they wouldn't be caught dead reading his autobiography. But I still think this is a book worth reading. Clinton is respectful toward everyone he writes about, including people who are known to be his political enemies. He gets a little long- winded from time to time and he goes overboard with his efforts to show that he did what he could to stop terrorism. But the book is still a pretty good read, albeit a long one. I doubt it will change the way you feel about Bill Clinton, but it will succeed at helping readers find some new facts about the former president and it will explain his point of view regarding the multitude of scandals that took place when he served as president.s still a pretty good read, albeit a long one.

But little coverage is given to the other side of equation- the people responsible for administering the penalty. This book attempts to cover what life it like for those who are given the gruesome task of flipping the lever, and it succeeds in some ways and fails in others.<br /><br />First of all, you need to know that this is not necessarily a political book. There is no debate here about the pros and cons of the death penalty in general. Instead, this book examines the lives of two men who work in the prison system- Donald Hocutt and Don Cabana. Hocutt is an older, more experienced executioner who seems to support the death penalty while Cabana wants to see many procedures reformed.<br /><br />Certain, specific executions in Mississippi are covered in this book, and some of the details can get rather nasty, especially when things don't go as planned. What the author is trying to assert, it seems, is that the death penalty needs to undergo some changes to make it more up to date and less morbid. We are talking about killing here, so a certain level of morbidity is expected. But the author seems to be advocating a change in the types of death penalty, with the elimination of the electric chair and gas chamber as means of execution due to the sometimes painful and sometimes longer, more agonizing deaths that they cause.<br /><br />This book is, overall, not very complete. It covers only the state of Mississippi and two men who perform executions. It really needs a broader base and a more in- depth study with more people, more places, and more convicts to be taken completely seriously. It's a nice place to start, but it will leave most readers with a sense of frustration, wanting to know more facts about the American death penalty.<br /> <br />	2004-08-23

An affiliate of Consumers Union, this company examines all sorts of products and services and reports on the good and bad, the pros and cons, and then ranks across different criteria. This buyer's guide is like the Consumer Reports magazine, except that it contains mostly ratings without many explanations of the different products.<br /><br />This guide can come in very handy not just for its product ratings, but also for some of its general advice- found in the front of the book. Here, you can lookup web sites for different manufacturers, tips on avoiding shopping traps, a table that helps consumers decide whether or not it's more financially efficient to repair or replace an item, and so on.<br /><br />One criticism that I must make about this guide is the limited number of products reviewed in some categories. Automobiles are covered very well, and so are a few other categories. But others, like certain appliances, only cover a fraction of the total brand names available. The book would be more complete if this area was improved.<br /><br />In spite of its few flaws, this is still a useful guide to own. It ranks products by overall score, showing consumers which products are the best, based on Consumer Report's scoring. I don't agree with everything I find in this book, but I still recommend it to aid in the buying process.	2004-08-23

Carmel	Most everyone knows about the federal government's disastrous debacle at Waco, Texas back in 1993. We have watched the testimonies, the congressional investigations, and the flames engulfing the building that housed the Branch Davidian religious sect. Some of us have even read books on the event, and many have been written. This book, written by survivor David Thibodeau, is one of the best yet.<br /><br />Thibodeau was right there, in the middle of the standoff with ATF and FBI agents, so his perspective is unique from others who have written about the event from the outside. Starting with the time when he first met David Koresh while playing in various bands in Los Angeles, Thibodeau talks about his interest in the Branch Davidians and explains what got him involved in the group; why he became interested in religion after never having much interest or instruction during his youth; why he decided to follow Koresh and his teachings; why he decided to stay at Mt. Carmel during the siege; how he handled the media and press following his escape from the fire; and his post- Mt. Carmel life, touring the country as an informational speaker.<br /><br />Thibodeau has a lot of anger to share in this book, not toward Koresh or the other members of the religious group, but toward the press and the U.S. government. He fully admits that Koresh wasn't perfect and that certain actions taken by Koresh (like sleeping with young girls) wasn't right and should have landed him in jail. But above all, he is most scornful of the media and the U.S. government. The members of the media acted like lap dogs during the siege, reporting on anything told to them by the ATF and FBI as if it were absolute truth. Thibodeau and the other members of the Davidians were saddened and angered by, for example, the reference to their group as a cult and the reference to their building as a compound. The various government reporting agencies promoted these terms to turn the public against the Davidians. Thibodeau is correct in his assertions about the government's actions in this area, and he makes some good points about this. It is true that Koresh himself was a little strange, but he was no real threat and the things he taught were hardly radical. If his teachings qualify the Branch Davidians as a cult, then many mainstream Protestant groups would also be cults. It is known, too, that the FBI deliberately prevented the release of a video tape that featured the different members of the group talking to the camera about their families and lives because the FBI was worried that, once the public saw this tape, they would see that these people were pretty ordinary and it would sway public opinion over to the Davidian's side.<br /><br />The government's handling of the investigation was purely political, with Democrats taking the side of the ATF and FBI, in order to protect the Clinton administration, and the Republicans taking the side of religious freedom in order to make Clinton and his administration look bad. Thibodeau talks about how sickening it was to watch this unfold. No one really seemed to care about truth or justice. All they cared about was protecting their own fellow politicians or making the opposing politicians look bad.<br /><br />The writing in this book is excellent, and Thisbodeau was very wise in making the decision to hire a professional editor to help with the work. Other victims of well- publicized tragedies have also written books, but many of them rely on their own amateurish writing skills to carry them through, often resulting in a book that is sub-par at best and that often fails to be as effective as it could have been. The writing in this book, thanks to the assistance of Leon Whiteson, is nearly flawless and it kept my attention throughout the reading.<br /><br />Thibodeau spends his time touring the nation now, giving speeches to different groups around the country about what happened and what needs to be done in the future to prevent anymore Wacos. He shows some strong courage in writing this book, openly admitting that certain actions taken by his own friends were wrong and were deserving of punishment. But he places the bulk of the blame on the ATF and FBI for starting all the trouble in the first place. Like Ruby Ridge, Waco is yet another example of what can happen when government power goes unchecked. And Thibodeau makes a strong case for reigning in the power of government in this well- written, personal book about the tragedy at Waco that killed more than eighty people.more Wacos.

Author Larry Sternberg is an intellectual man of the Jewish faith who dedicates this book to uncovering what he feels are certain mysteries to the Jewish personality. He cannot understand, given the past injustices at the hands of government, why his fellow American Jews are so willing to embrace government as a protector rather than an enemy. He also cannot understand why Jews almost always vote for members of the Democratic Party in elections at all levels.<br /><br />I can understand Sternberg?s bewilderment and I, too, think it is unusual whenever any group of people is so loyal to one political party. But some of his reasoning in this book just doesn?t fly. First of all, he misses the mark right off the bat when he says that the Republican Party supports and works to make government smaller. This is, of course, one of the great falsehoods in politics, for Republicans are every bit as hungry for power and cash as their Democratic counterparts. The only difference between the two major parties is how they spend the loot, not whether or not they want to spend it. Liberal Democrats would rather spend the money on social programs while Republicans would rather spend on national defense. These spending preferences could be one of the key reasons why Jews tend to be liberal, but Sternberg fails to make this connection.<br /><br />Different topics are covered in this book, like health care, education, gun rights, affirmative action, and many others. In each case, Sternberg argues why the limited government position is the preferable one. I agree with him once again, but I think his explanations regarding how these smaller- government measures would benefit Jews is too vague and not very well- thought. He doesn?t really provide any concrete examples of liberalism harming Jews. His basis for the small government argument is only that Jews need to be wary of government power so that events like the German holocaust never occur again.<br /><br />This book has a solid premise and a catchy title, which is why I obtained my copy. But its argumentation is not the best and it?s doubtful that it will do anything to change anyone?s mind. Read it, if you want, but don?t be surprised if you come away with only a small change of heart. It isn?t profound enough to get people to reconsider their political leanings, like the author intended.se and a catchy title, which is why I obtained my copy.

The book is divided into a total of nineteen different sections, with each area explaining common mistakes and how to avoid making them in the future.<br /><br />Written like a troubleshooting guide and a preventive maintenance tool, this book is sometimes obvious and sometimes surprising. I read with interest some of the areas where I generally don?t know as much as I should, like the section on automotive care. Here, I found some very useful tips that I had never heard about before. Other areas, like the section on career, are also very helpful and they offer advice that could apply to anyone.<br /><br />The main problem that I have with this book is that the sections themselves are too short to offer the type of thorough advice that they should. With a total of 320 pages in the book and nineteen total sections, the pages per section works out to only about sixteen. This isn?t enough, in many instances, to adequately cover all there is to talk about with some of these subjects.<br /><br />This book is no substitute for general reference guides like almanacs, dictionaries, or anything else. But it still offers some value and I recommend adding it to your self- help library. It?s not the best book around, but it can come in handy when you need a quick solution to a problem relating to one of the key areas covered in this book.	2004-07-21

We have all viewed the images on television and in print, showing the airplanes striking the buildings, the fire, and the collapse of the World Trade Center. We have seen firefighters and rescue dogs searching for bodies trapped in the rubble. And we have seen politicians talking about the attacks and what must be done to prevent such an event in the future.<br />But one thing that we don't see very frequently is information on the human victims themselves. That is, until now. In this book, the New York Times has taken on a great task: Assembling together a full volume showing pictures and personal information on each of the victims who died during the attack on September 11, 2001. The Times originally started to do this in the actual newspaper itself, highlighting the different victims with a section called \\"Portraits of Grief\\". It was from these portraits that the book was derived from.<br />Most (but not all) of the victims are pictured in the pages of this book, with a small, black and white photo of the person's face, followed by a brief summary of the person's life, career, family, etc. The portrait information isn't extensive, but it manages to let you, the reader, know at least a little bit about each of the victims, complete with quotations from family members expressing how their lost husband/wife/child, etc. touched their lives in a positive way.<br />Besides the photos of people, there are other pictures in this book, with most of them dedicated to the funerals, remembrance gatherings, and other grief- related events. You won't find pictures of the smoking buildings in this book. It centers instead on the people.<br />Overall, this book is a nice effort on the part of the people at the New York Times. Approx. 143 people took part in the creation of this book, and their names are all listed in the back. It was a commendable effort and while I would have liked the book better if the pictures had been in color, I still think this is a book worth owning.

An economics professor and outspoken on political and social issues, Williams? views take on a libertarian/conservative flavor. And the columns he selected for this book are consistent in their analysis, with Williams always taking the pro- liberty position, regardless of topic.<br /><br />This book includes sections titled 1. Race & Sex, 2. Government, 3. Education, 4. Environment and Health,<br />5. International, 6. Law and Society, and 7. Potpourri, which is a miscellaneous category that includes columns that do not fit into one of the other six. Each of these seven sections includes articles relating to that particular topic, with titles and dates of original publication.<br /><br />Williams talks at length about economic issues, which should be expected given his background and his profession. But he is just as effective (many even more so) when he tackles personal issues in this book, like racism, sex equality, the failed war on drugs, and other non- economic topics. His greatest skill comes in the way he takes complicated topics and explains them using examples that anyone can relate to and understand.<br /><br />If I had to make a few criticisms of this book, it would first be the fact that the book doesn?t flow very well. Since it is comprised of a collection of previously published material, it doesn?t read like a normal book. Also, I did notice a few typos and awkward sentences that are not always easy to follow. Williams writes this book using a style that attempts to use as few words as possible to get a point across. This is nice, for the sake of saving space. But it can sometimes prove to be inadequate for reading and effective communication.<br /><br />Williams is considered a conservative, even though he is obviously not a social conservative, based on the views he stresses in this writing. He is often politically incorrect, which I admire and enjoy. Still, the fact that he is considered conservative will cause many to disagree with many of his opinions and forego giving this book a chance. However, I think the book is still worth a look regardless of political persuasion. Williams may not change your mind about a particular political or economic topic, but he will succeed at making you reconsider some of your positions or at least looking at them from a different perspective.

Looking to make a few extra bucks and start that business you've always dreamed about? If so, then this book could come in handy. It presents a lengthy introduction about how to start your own business, followed by the listing of the \\"101 best\\", which includes things like landscaping, photography, painting, etc. Each listing includes answers to six basic questions: 1. What will I be doing? 2. What will I need to start? 3. Who will my customers be? 4. How much should I charge? 5. How much will I make? and 6. How will I get started?<br />This book is meant as a beginners guide, and it should not be viewed any other way. The contents are very basic, and they do no go in- depth with any of these different home businesses. The author, Dan Ramsey, has written many books about small business. This one is really intended as a guide to show you the ropes, but not much else. It lets you know the minimum efforts/requirements needed to get started on your new part- time business.<br />Since this book was published back in 1996, it is already a little bit out of date. There are many technological businesses (using the internet and other high- tech) that are not described in this book because back when it was published, many of these businesses didn't exist yet. An updated edition of this book would be very helpful.<br />With only one or two pages dedicated to each of these \\"101 best\\", you will likely need more information if you really want to get serious about your chosen area of business. This book is nice for its brainstorming qualities, but you will certainly need to know more once you have decided to start.	2004-07-14

In this book, Limbaugh presents some arguments explaining why he feels that the liberal establishment is waging war against Christians and Christianity.<br />Limbaugh composed this book as part history lesson and part modern- day political guide. He talks about the educational system in the United States, pointing out that the Bible was once the center of schooling for all youngsters. Today, teachers are forbidden from leading students in prayer or from promoting Biblical passages in the classroom. Public displays of religious symbols on government property were once the<br />norm. Today, they have been ruled unconstitutional by the \\"liberal\\" judicial system. He talks about speech codes, political correctness, and other changes that he feels have been made for the worst in the past fifty or so years.<br />I can agree with some of the complaints that Limbaugh has with the American system. It is true that, in many cases, political correctness has gone way too far. It is also true that Christians as a group are often singled out for harassment. I don't agree that they are being \\"persecuted\\", because there hasn't been any bloodshed or physical pain endured. But it is true that Christians as a whole have been targeted for personal attacks.<br />One problem I have with this book is its explanations regarding America's foundation and constitutional laws. Limbaugh correctly points out that most of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and most of the population in general back in the late 1700's was Christian. But he seems to think that merely \\"being\\" Christian means that the constitution and the basis of law are also religious in nature. I can agree that these men were, mostly, men who believed in a higher power. But that doesn't mean that they wanted the U.S. government to be founded on religion. If they wanted this, they would have explicitly added it to the constitution.<br />Limbaugh writes this book in a respectful way, and he avoids the tendency for authors like himself to resort to immaturity by calling their opponents names and belittling them at every turn. There is no doubt which side of the road Limbaugh is coming from. But he sticks with his arguments and avoids the temptation to hurl insults at those he disagrees with.<br />This is the type of book that some will love and others will hate. I have many issues with Limbaugh's ideas and his questionable logic. But I can also agree with him on some points, like the silliness of political correctness and the targeting of Christians for harassment. It is true that they are being targeted, but not necessarily because of religion, per se. I think Christians are attacked simply because they are in the majority, making them an easy target.<br />If you like some good, intellectual debate to get yourself thinking, then you might enjoy \\"Persecution\\". Like me, you may not agree with everything Limbaugh has to say, but his writing is still pretty good and he does avoid name calling and other acts of immaturity. I recommend taking a look at this book to see what you think.If they wanted this, they would have explicitly added it to the constitution.<br />Limbaugh writes this book in a respectful way, and he avoids the tendency for authors like himself to resort to immaturity by calling their opponents names and belittling them at every turn.

Bursting on the scene in the late 1970's, McEnroe brought a new dimension to the sport. He relives some of his greatest sports moments in this book, \\"You Cannot be Serious\\".<br />McEnroe was known for his legendary temper, and he explains to readers how he got this way and why he continued to blow his top from time to time. He admits, in retrospect, that he went too far more than once, but he stops short of completely apologizing for his on- court antics. Among other reasons, he points out that the promoters of professional tennis quietly encouraged his behavior. They didn't necessarily think it was the best way to act, but they also knew that McEnroe's bad boy image helped increase the popularity of the sport.<br />McEnroe talks about more than just tennis in this book. He also covers his tumultuous marriage with actress Tatum O'Neil; his encounters with rock and roll superstars; his second marriage to pop singer Patty Smythe; and his present- day occupation as a tennis announcer and commentator. McEnroe lays his heart on the line in this book, letting the reader know exactly how he felt about different players in the game and the women in his life.<br />Even though I like John McEnroe, both the man and the player, there are a few negative points to make about this book. First of all, there's the editing job by James Kaplan. There are some poorly- worded sentences throughout the pages and there are too many exclamation marks and colons in places where they are not necessary. Second, McEnroe's ego could be hard for some readers to stomach. He brags on himself and always seems to have an excuse to explain why he lost certain key matches.<br />Overall, this is still a fun book to read, in spite of its flaws. It could have been better with some more thought and effort, but it still makes for an enjoyable read. McEnroe lets you know exactly how he feels about the sport of tennis, the various personalities involved, and his own personal relationships. He's very serious, and he wants you to understand where he is coming from and where he is going.s involved, and his own personal relationships.

I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Bock at a convention where he signed a copy of this book for me. I had heard of Bock before, and based on what I knew, I was confident that his book would be a good one.<br />Bock dissects the medical marijuana issue, talking about the different initiatives that have come before the voters, the activists who helped get them on the ballot, the problem of effective distribution, and the interesting methods used by opposition forces to bring them down. Bock explains the history of this plant as a drug, reminding everyone how marijuana once was an ordinary, acceptable prescription drug used to treat many different ailments and how the federal governments' anti- marijuana propaganda was used to turn this relatively harmless drug into a Schedule 1, forbidden fruit substance- the same classification that includes heroin and crack.<br />This book has many memorable parts that get you thinking, but I think my personal favorites are the chapters that talk about the reaction by the feds when each medical marijuana initiative passed its respective states. In each instance, when placed before the voters, the people have responded in decisive fashion, voting to allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. And in each case, the feds reacted in a rather strange way. Instead of acknowledging the will of the people, Bock points out in the book that they tried to brush it off, claiming that the people had been \\"duped\\". This is a very weird reaction, and I think it speaks volumes. It shows that the feds had no intelligent argument against medical marijuana and had to resort to, in essence, a form of name calling. It was a sour grapes- type response, and it showed that the feds were just irritated that the public didn't fall for its propaganda anymore.<br />Bock is obviously on the side of the medical marijuana patients, but he still manages to show objectivity in his analysis and conclusions. He agrees that some of the opponents' concerns could be valid, but then he quickly explains why they are unfounded, offering evidence to back up his pro- medical marijuana stance.<br />&quot;Waiting to Inhale&quot; is, overall, a very well- thought out, very intelligent book from journalist Alan Bock. It effectively discusses the past, present, and future ramifications of medical marijuana as a prescription drug and its place in society. It's a good book for all to read, particularly social conservatives who think there is no practical use for this black- market drug.ctivity in his analysis and conclusions.

Both of these books contain secretly taped White House conversations from the Johnson presidency. This book covers from early Fall, 1964 through late summer, 1965.<br />LBJ shows, through his own words, how frustrating and stressful life can be in Washington, especially when engaged in an unpopular war. Read as LBJ expresses his disgust with those who oppose the war while at the same time admitting in private that the Vietnam War cannot be won. He felt that the commitment had been made and there was no way to turn back, even though the chances for victory were slim to none.<br />Besides the Vietnam War, LBJ has a full plate of other problems to deal with. Racial tensions at home, civil rights, voting rights, the Great Society, possible Communism in the Dominican Republic, and a sex scandal involving one of his closest aides has the president up in arms and stressed to the max. LBJ seems exhausted throughout most of this book, and consistently in a bad mood. He battles depression and anxiety throughout this year of his presidency, knowing that things are not the way they should be and feeling helpless to make them any better.<br />LBJ was worried about his legacy and always wanted to be remembered as the next Lincoln or FDR and not as \\"another Harding\\" as he would often say. But he didn't really get a chance to fulfill his desires as president, thanks to the Vietnam War and other obstacles. He was paranoid and distrustful of most everyone, including many of his friends. Aside from his immediate family, his relationships were not very strong at all during this time in his presidency.<br />\\"Reaching for Glory\\" is, overall, a fun and informative book to read. You feel like you're eavesdropping on the former president and his associates as they converse on the phone. It's all here, with only a small amount of editing and it shows what life was like in the LBJ White House as he tackled the difficult issues during his second year in office.ifficult issues during his second year in office.	2004-06-26

Residing in the state of Arkansas and specializing in political commentary, Greenberg had the opportunity to follow and observe the Clinton legacy for more than twenty years when he published this book, \\"No Surprises\\", in 1996. Starting with the Clinton presidency and continuing through his first term as president, Greenberg has voiced many opinions about Clinton and his policies, many of which are included in this book.<br />Rather than writing this book in the normal sense, Greenberg instead chose to make this book a collection of previous writings about the governor- turned- president from Arkansas. Greenberg is a very articulate, thoughtful journalist who has the ability to keep readers interested even when the reader may not agree with his viewpoints. When it comes to Bill Clinton, Greenberg's feelings are obviously mixed, based on the articles that he chose for inclusion in this book. In some instances, Greenberg praises the governor/president for doing the right thing. Other times, Greenberg is highly critical of \\"young smoothie\\", particularly with Clinton's tendency to agree with whatever views his present audience espouses. Throughout his entire political career, Clinton has been known to do this, and he has the practice down to an art, seeming to agree with anyone at anytime, even when the opinions he voices and the people he agrees with are contradictory with each other.<br />Greenberg is the man who coined the phrase \\"slick willie\\" and the name stuck with Clinton throughout his political career. You can sense a feeling of frustration on the part of Greenberg toward the former governor/president as you read these articles. Greenberg seems like he really wants to like Clinton and support him more than he already does, but some of Clinton's tactics are just more than the journalist can stomach.<br />Paul Greenberg is a very compelling and respectful writer. Unlike the numerous Clinton- bashing books out there, \\"No Surprises\\" is respectfully written and compelling to read. Greenberg avoids negative bashing, even when he feels that Clinton has made an enormous mistake in governing. It all makes for a very entertaining read from this talented journalist from Arkansas.tful writer.

He has the ability to write in a candid, yet respectful manner and his style is engaging and entertaining. This book, published in 1992, reveals some of Greenberg's influential roots, explaining how he got where he is and the people and events that have shaped his writing and his life.<br />Greenberg touches on many important influences in this book. In particular, he makes mention of his family and how his parents helped to instill certain values within him as a young man growing up in Louisiana and then Arkansas. Greenberg also points out his Jewish religious upbringing and his small town roots in the South as major contributors to his life and, hence, to his views and writing.<br />Some of Greenberg's opinions presented in the journalistic pieces included in this book will not sit well with certain readers. Greenberg's views are mostly, but not entirely, conservative in nature. But they deviate from this course on many occasions, which is part of the reason why Greenberg often refers to himself as an \\"ideologically unreliable conservative\\". You cannot really place a label on Greenberg's political ideology, since many of his opinions are compatible with different political philosophies.<br />Since this book is comprised of a collection of previous writings, it doesn't have the smoothness that some readers expect and demand. Instead, it changes direction from time to time, with articles included from many decades of writing, sorted into seven broad categories: family, religion, writing, small towns, the South, the American nation, and baseball. Greenberg selected the articles for this book, based on how closely they fit into these categories and how significant they were to his life and his profession.<br />This is a very intriguing read from an intriguing man. Even though I don't always see eye to eye with Greenberg, I still enjoy his writing. If nothing else, I can always count on Greenberg to remain civil and respectful when he writes and to hold my attention for the duration of the article. And this book is no exception. It presents some of Greenberg's most powerful influences on his life, showing what factors, great and small, helped to form the opinions of this award- winning journalist.ll enjoy his writing.

They often spend several weeks out in the ocean on a relatively small vessel (usually less than 100 feet in length), hoping that they will land that once- in- a- lifetime catch of fish that will improve their financial well- being.<br />When things go as planned, the life of a fisherman can be adventurous and rewarding. But when the search for sea- dwelling creatures is interrupted by a violent storm, a fun situation can turn critical and even fatal. Such is the case of the men and women who became stranded at sea in the \\"storm of the century\\", back in October of 1991. Also referred to as the \\"perfect storm\\", this violent act of nature left many people dead without a trace. Author Sebastian Junger wrote this book about the people who were aboard these boats, with quotes from some of the survivors and speculation about what could have happened to those who never returned.<br />The \\"Perfect Storm\\" occurred in the North Atlantic Ocean, just east of the New England states, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. This area is not normally known for producing violent storms, due to its northern latitude. This sudden turn in the weather took everyone by surprise, including those who were out at sea. They had no forewarning about the intensity of this storm, which seemed to brew up out of nowhere. Most of the captains and crew members have dealt with storms before so they knew what procedures to follow. But nothing could properly prepare them for the massive force with which they were suddenly faced.<br />Junger spends most of this book talking about the people who manned these boats, the events leading up to when they set sail, and the storm itself. Junger is best when he is describing the actual human events during the storms and the heroic efforts of the Coast Guard and Air National Guard to rescue these sailors. Throughout the book, he gets sidetracked from his story and starts talking about statistics and facts about hurricanes, drowning, rainfall, and other data. Some of these facts are interesting and they add to the enjoyment of the book. Other things are annoying and not very useful and they get in the way of the telling of the story.<br />Junger makes frequent mention of the \\"Andrea Gail\\"- one of the boats that was out in the water when the storm picked up speed and was lost without a trace of anything- people or vessel. It was obviously ripped apart in the storm. Junger mentions it from time to time, and he reports the few facts that are known. While the storm is taking place and afterward, when rescue attempts are being made, there is no more contact with the Andrea Gail. Junger provides some speculative guesses about what was likely taking place on the boat, in an effort to keep the reader informed about this particular fishing vessel. But there is no way to know what was really taking place after the radio communication ended suddenly on October 28, 1991.<br />Junger writes pretty well throughout this book, and he effectively captures the terror that must have been felt by those who were caught in this violent act of nature. The book could have been better, however, if he had included more interviews and quotes from survivors not only on the boats, but also those who were affected when the storm ran ashore and damaged their coastal properties. It also could have been improved with a better ending. Junger ends the writing suddenly, with a few paragraphs about another vessel whose crew was lost in a storm. There is no conclusion or anything to wrap up the book and summarize the key events. It just ends abruptly.<br />Finding ones' self caught in a bad storm in the middle of the open sea is frequently- occurring nightmare for some people, but it has become reality for a few. This book shows that the life of a fisherman is not all drinking, fun, and games. There are tremendous risks involved when one decides to spend several weeks at sea, and author Sebastian Junger presents a pretty good book about the perils of this lifestyle. It's a book worth reading, although it could have been better with a few improvements.a, and author Sebastian Junger presents a pretty good book about the perils of this lifestyle.

He is disgusted with the two- party system and he was repulsed by the choices presented by the two major parties in the 2000 elections, Bush and Gore. He is tired of watching politicians at all levels sell themselves out for corporate cash. He wrote this book as a guide to the corruption that exists in politics and what you and I can do to stop it.<br />Hightower was once an elected official himself, so he is experienced with the world of politics and how it operates. In this book, he explains how different the parties of today are compared to those of the past- particularly Democrats, whom Hightower feels could be counted on in the past to support populist causes but who no longer seem to care about anything but money. He talks about the problem of campaign financing and the need for reform. He shows how groups like the World Trade Organization and NAFTA have damaged the economy of the United States by favoring a few large corporations to the detriment of the common man.<br />I like Hightower's outspoken style and his demand to return to a government of self- rule for the people. However, there are a few instances in the book where he seems to get a little off- track when he delivers his populist message. For one thing, Hightower seems to have a strong and undeniable envy toward anyone with more money than himself, and he seems to think that all rich people are wicked and deserving of punishment. He seems to think the same of most corporations, even though a large percentage of companies are good corporate citizens. Some of his economic analysis is also a little shady, as he attempts to define how the economy can and should function to better ensure that the underprivileged are properly taken care of.<br />Hightower uses humor throughout this book to help hold his audience and keep them interested in reading more. He doesn't go over the line, like some other political authors are known to do. Hightower does take stabs at specific individuals, but he manages to keep things on a civil level, without getting too nasty or too personal.<br />With the types of candidates that the Dems and Repubs have been nominating lately, it's not surprising that so many voters are becoming disillusioned with the American political process. Jim Hightower is one of these people who is fed up, and he makes his views known in this book. \\"If the Gods had Meant us to Vote\\" is not a perfect volume of political analysis.

Photos are sent back from the Middle East showing the soldiers in their military garb with weapons in hand and we constantly hear about how the war is going. We expect this during times of war, but what takes place in a normal day when there is no war to fight? What do the military personnell do in a typical day?<br />These questions can be quickly answered by reading this book. It's mostly a collection of photographs, with only a minimal amount of wording. It starts out in the early morning hours, showing photos of military men and women eating breakfast and engaging in physical workouts, then proceeds throughout the day, ending with pictures of night time security workers checking highly sensitive places to make sure all is clear.<br />This book is 256 pages in length, but it includes mostly pictures, so it doesn't take very long to read. It is well- organized, too, with an introduction by Walter Cronkite and a world map on each page, indicating the area of the world where a particular picture was taken. And the photos, like I mentioned above, are organized in order of the time of day they were taken, allowing the reader to follow along from sunrise to sunset and gain a better understanding of what life is like in the military.<br />This coffee table- size book makes contains many great pictures, showing men and women at work and at play with their families and friends. It's a nice addition to any home library and it proves to be a good educational guide, letting readers see and understand exactly what takes place during a normal day for the United States military personnel.	2004-05-26

This book follows that trend with chapters on stupidity as it relates to government, law, business, education, entertainment, taxes, and other subjects.<br />Some of the quotes and acts of silliness presented here were committed by well- known entertainers, politicians, sports personalities, and other famous people and they make for some of the book's most memorable and funniest moments. Al Gore, Bill Gates, Justine Bateman, Bob Ney (Ohio Republican representative), and other members of the fraternal order of the rich and famous are quoted in the book at length, showing how they either made a silly- sounding comment or twisted the truth to get themselves out of trouble.<br />Not all of the comments and acts of zaniness involved in this book center around the well-to-do. There are plenty of quotes and acts of stupidity committed by ordinary people too. And some of them will have you rolling on the floor with laughter while others will have you a little bit concerned about the condition of Americans and politics in general. Most of the stuff included in this book is flat out funny with nothing further to contemplate. But other things make you wonder if certain laws and/or conventional wisdom have gone too far. Like the case of some kids in a school getting arrested for allegedly possessing and distributed an illegal substance that turned out to be a package of grape kool- aid. Or a woman who stole a firecracker from someone's home, mistook it for a candle, was injured when it blew up, and then sued the homeowners for not labeling the stolen good as a firecracker.<br />Each chapter of this book is laid out in a reference- style format, with highlighted and bulleted text. In addition to the stupid sayings and actions, there are also lists that are unusual and often very funny. Like the \\"most unusual items ever auctioned at Ebay\\" or the \\"worst vehicles ever manufactured\\".<br />Overall, this is a fun and entertaining book that makes a great way to pass the time and a nice idea for a gift.

What would fundamentalists do to the Bill of Rights, if given the chance? How would America function under the rule of theocratic extremists?<br />These questions and others are examined in this book by a whole host of different authors. Kimberly Blaker contributes the most, and she is joined by other concerned authors, like John Suarez, Herb Silverman, Edward Buckner, and others. Each one of the authors contributes to their specific area of expertise, touching on such hot issues as racism, education, homophobia, church/state relations, and government in general.<br />Some of the quotes from prominent Christian fundamentalists, like Pat Robertson, Gary Bauer, and others, will alarm some readers so don't be surprised if you come away from this book with a feeling of shock and concern. Fundamentalist leaders are very well organized and they have a mission to convert the United States into a theocracy and eliminate the separation of church and state. They have already achieved success with the Republican Party, which has adopted many Fundamentalist doctrines into its platform.<br />Before anyone gets too scared, though, it should be noted that the vast majority of Christians do not share these radical views. These extremist positions are held by a very small fraction of Christian adherents and while they come across as very anti- American in nature, they are still not as frightening as they seem. The reason is because most Americans believe in the Constitution and would never accept or allow these types of changes to take place. Like the authors point out, this won't stop the fundamentalists from trying to force their agenda on the nation, but there is only so far they can go with the present system of checks and balances.<br />I enjoyed most of this book, but I didn't like the writing style or the contents of chapter 3 (covering education), written by Bobbie Kirkhart. Not only is the writing itself inferior to Kimberly Blaker and the others, it also presents some very weak arguments in defense of the public schools. I can agree that an educational system run exclusively by religious organizations with no room for other choices or opinions would be a bad thing. But I cannot go along with some of Kirkhart's assertions, like her claim that private schools are not really any better than public ones. I think she goes way too far in her unyielding support of public education.<br />This is an interesting book that explains the extremist views of radical Christian forces in America and how they would like to eliminate most of the freedoms and civil rights that we all take for granted. Their ideas are too outrageous to ever become reality. But they need to be paid attention to and monitored nonetheless, to make sure that they do not succeed any further than they already have in implementing their anti- American agenda.art.

We know that, sooner or later, we will see them in a movie production or making a television appearance. We also know that, sooner or later, we will hear them voicing their concerns about any number of political issues. And we know that, more often than not, the political side they take will have a distinctly left- leaning direction.<br />This book takes a close look at the entertainers that make the Hollywood world go round and it discusses the background and the different events over the past 50 plus years that have led to the present \\"liberal\\" Hollywood mindset. Communist infiltration into the American way of life back during the McCarthy era, the Vietnam War, and other events were decisive in shaping Hollywood politics. These liberal views have precipitated over the years to more and more generations of Hollywood entertainers. They are shared by a large majority of Hollywood folk, in proportions that do not reflect the population as a whole.<br />The Hollywood elite can often be counted on to voice some wild opinions, and author James Hirsen presents some of them in this book. Quotes like Chevy Chase's comment that \\"Cuba has proven that socialism can work\\" and Sean Penn's nutty statement that he would like to \\"trade news personality Bill O'Reilly for Osama Bin Laden\\" are just a sample of some of the crazy things that have come out of the mouths of our beloved movie making friends in La La land.<br />I like the way Hirsen keeps this book on an entertaining and humorous level. He doesn't hit below the belt, like some other political writers are prone to doing. Rather, he keeps things lightened up and funny as he shows how biased the members of Hollywood often are in their collectivist political mindset. They almost always favor a government- intervention position (except for issues like abortion and a few others) and they often cozy up with authoritarian- type individuals, like Fidel Castro and others.<br />The dry humor contained in this book and the one- sidedness makes it the type that many readers will scorn. However, I think it's an entertaining read for people of all political stripes and colors. Hollywood stars are entitled to their own opinions, but what some of them say and do will surprise many readers. Hirsen includes lots of amusing quotes and stories about the bigwigs in Hollywood and others in the entertainment industry, enough to have readers simultaneously rolling their eyes and shaking their heads as they read some of the outrageousness that comes out of Tinseltown.others) and they often cozy up with authoritarian- type individuals, like Fidel Castro and others.<br />The dry humor contained in this book and the one- sidedness makes it the type that many readers will scorn.

If so, author Mark Smith has a deal for you: membership to the all- exclusive Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, or VRWC for short. Here, you will learn all the tricks of the trade that liberals use to press their agenda on the people. Membership is offered completely free of charge and all adults are welcome\\".<br />Author Mark Smith is a trial lawyer and conservative commentator and activist who wrote this book as a way of arming conservatives with the necessary ammunition needed to confront and defeat liberal arguments on a wide array of subjects and political topics. Each chapter (there are 28 in all) is short with brief responses to some of the more common liberal concerns about the environment, education, the war in Iraq, the death penalty, health care, affirmative action, abortion, and other issues.<br />Smith's performance is strongest when he is talking about economic issues, school choice, and a few other subjects. The reason he makes more sense in these areas is because he has statistics and facts to back up his claims. But in other areas, like the death penalty, abortion, the war in Iraq, etc., Smith doesn't really provide anything substantive to back his ideas. His attitude is arrogant, and he seems like he wants you to just accept his premises for the arguments as fact without any evidence to justify his claims. He seems to be saying \\"I'm right because I'm a conservative\\". For example, in the chapter on abortion, Smith immediately states that a human fetus is a person with full rights at the moment of fertilization. He includes one quote from another anti- abortion individual and that's it. There is no in- depth discussion about the topic. He just starts with his own premise, says it's true, and then moves on to the next part of his argument. He follows the same formula in other chapters, too.<br />One important point to remember is that what Smith describes in this book is actually his own brand of conservative. At no point does he suggest that Republicans adhere to every facet of the political idealism that he believes in. It's obvious, though, that he supports Republicans as the \\"lesser of two evils\\". But it's also obvious that he realizes the Republican party doesn't really practice what it preaches when it comes to fighting for \\"small\\" government. Republican administrations have expanded government at an even faster pace then their Democratic counterparts, and there is substantial proof to back this up. And even Mark Smith isn't necessarily against big government. He gives the reader the illusion in this book that he wants government to be limited, but then he babbles on and on about increasing the military budget, expanding the death penalty, and effectively launching a war against abortions. All of these measures involve large expansions in government spending and government power.<br />The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy Handbook has too many chapters and attempts to cover too many topics to be completely effective. Each chapter contains about 5 to 10 pages. There is no possible way to have an intellectual and thorough discussion of topics like abortion, health care, the death penalty, and other hot issues in such a small amount of space. In addition, the questions that are answered are far too basic. Smith avoids the really tough questions and sticks instead with those that are direct and simple to refute.<br />Overall, this book is inadequate as a tool to use against liberal arguments. It's far too simplistic and many of its arguments (like those dealing with the war in Iraq, Bush's electoral win over Gore, abortion, etc.) are weak and incomplete. I seriously doubt that a book like this will succeed in converting liberals over to conservative political ideology.

This book- the first one published by the organization- is comprised of a collection of articles submitted by MoveOn members, explaining how they got involved and how they succeeded (and sometimes failed) in making a difference.<br />The book includes fifty different stories divided into five areas: connecting through the internet, exercising one's privilege to vote, working with the media, getting involved personally, and getting involved politically. The articles themselves are short and to the point, ranging in length from one to three pages each. MoveOn.org members do not waste time and/or space in this book. They quickly explain what they did and how they did it.<br />Some of the stories presented in this book are interesting and creative, showing some surprising ways to help work for political change. Others are more mundane and ordinary, and don't really explain anything new and exciting. The editors of this book decided on this set of fifty stories based on inspiration, ease of application to anyone, creativity, etc. I found that some of the stories were actually pretty good, while others (like attending a rally) were pretty dull and didn't really inspire me much at all.<br />To help readers gain a better understanding about what an activist should do, each story includes a gray- shaded area with additional \\"MoveOn tips\\"- a bulleted list of ideas to take with you on your way to your next activist activity. The tips relate to each individual story and they summarize some important things to think about when you begin your political task.<br />MoveOn is a liberal organization and its members believe in a collectivist ideology that primarily favors Democrats and other progressives. But readers who are more conservative shouldn't let this fact get in the way of reading this book. The reason I say this is because the tips, the ideas, and the personal stories included here are things that can be applied to anyone, regardless of political affiliation. No matter what political banner you might carry, there is still some valuable advice to be found in the pages of this book.<br />\\"50 Ways to Love Your Country\\" includes some inspirational stories with some good ideas for activism, blended together with some ordinary, boring methods for making your mark in politics. Not every story is a successful one. There are some stories where the ultimate goal was not achieved.

He has written books about the subject of Islam before, and he writes this one with a keen sense of education in mind. Most people know very little about the religion known as Islam, and Esposito seems like he is on a mission, in this book, to help enlighten the world's people about the facts and myths regarding the world's second largest religion.<br />I think it's safe to say that most people know very little about Islam. Until I read this book, I didn't really know much either. I knew some of the most basic things, like that the Quran was the holy book of Islam; the prayers that Muslims say each day; and a few other things. But my knowledge level ended right there. When I picked up this book, I began to learn things that I had never heard of before. Probably the greatest surprise was the fact that the Islamic religion regards Jesus Christ and Abraham as the second and third most important men to ever walk the face of the earth (after, of course, Muhammad). The next surprise was when I discovered that Islam teaches that the virgin birth of Jesus was real, and the Quran makes mention of Jesus and Mary even more frequently than the Christian Bible. Other facts were noteworthy, but not as shocking, like the fact that the Quran allows a man to have as many as four wives provided that he will treat them equally and support them.<br />The issue of the day with Islam is whether or not its religious creeds are conducive to violence. There is a full chapter in this book that attempts to answer this question. According to the Quran, violence is acceptable in certain situations, like when a man's family and/or faith might be threatened. Here lies the problem with interpretation. To a more radical member of the faith, this means that any threat at all to one's faith is deserving of retaliation (and that could include almost anything). But to a more moderate Muslim, this is interpreted to mean that only self- defense is permissible.<br />Esposito keeps this book on a factual level. There is no analysis or any open debate of the issues. Esposito wrote this book as a way to educate the world's people about the religion of Islam- what the Quran says, what Islamic tradition allows, what customs and cultural norms dictate, etc. There is no arguing on the part of Esposito. He just tells you what is known to be true and leaves it at that.<br />In the aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001, Islam has taken center stage in the world debate over religion and violence. Many people have taken sides in the debate, labeling Muslims as purveyors of hate and violence. But the truth is, very little is really known about Islam by the worlds non- Muslim population. Esposito's book attempts to change all of that, with a simple to read, question and answer type format. It makes a good beginner's book on the subject of Islam, with lots of facts about the second most common religion in the world, after Christianity.uslim, this is interpreted to mean that only self- defense is permissible.<br />Esposito keeps this book on a factual level.

Mathematics of Investing is a reference guide intended to assist people in understanding how various financial calculations are made. The guide has chapters on such topics as time value of money, taxes and inflation, options trading, mutual funds, and others.<br />Graphs, tables, and other illustrations accompany a good number of the pages in this guide. This is helpful, I think, because it makes some of the terminology easier to understand and it makes the book a little more interesting than it would otherwise be. A book like this isn't something you would want to curl up on the couch and read for enjoyment. This is a reference guide, and anything that can help it be less boring is a plus.<br />Cross- references in the front of this book make it easy to look up formulas. Along with a listing of the chapters of the book, there is another table of contents that lists the pages to find a specific formula. Most people who buy this book will use it as a reference for looking up formulas, so this cross- reference in the front is helpful.<br />One thing that will probably make many people hesitate to purchase this book is the high price tag. The book is only 256 pages in length, so I am not sure why the cost is so much. With a price this high, many potential buyers might want to forgo buying it new and seek out a used copy instead. You can save yourself a lot of money by purchasing this book used.<br />Computing rates of return, investment growth, the effects of taxes and inflation, and other financial measurements takes some time and effort. With this book, a novice can gain a better understanding of how different financial computations are made. It's not a perfect book, and I did find a few typos as I thumbed through the pages. But it does provide a decent starting point to understanding investment computations.	2004-03-30

Yet all three of these areas represent growing, thriving components of the national economy. This latest book by Eric Schlosser examines these three segments of the economy, and while it provides some good insight in some areas, it misses the mark in others.<br />In the first chapter, the author talks about the fallacies and misleading information about marijuana and how the failed war on drugs has caused countless American tragedies while doing absolutely nothing to stop this very lucrative business from continuing to thrive underground. Many people have been unnecessarily searched; had their property seized under false pretenses; and sometimes have even been killed by the drug police. Schlosser correctly points out these many travesties of the drug war, and he concludes the chapter by stating that the only logical resolution to the problem to legalize the product and tax it.<br />The chapters on the pornography industry and migrant workers are not quite as good, but they still have some good points to make. Schlosser talks about the frustration faced by illegal workers who want a job and often give in and work in the strawberry fields of California for very low wages. They have no recourse because they are here illegally. And with the pornography industry, Schlosser seems sympathetic to those who are prosecuted for engaging in consensual activity. However, in these two chapters, Schlosser isn't very clear on what should be done to solve the problems. After the chapter on immigrant workers, all Schlosser can do is blame the free market for the problem. The situation is, of course, much more complex than that. The real issue is what to do with migrant workers. If they had full rights and if employers were held accountable for their actions, there wouldn't be a free market problem. It almost seems like Schlosser just threw this in because he couldn't think of any other way to address the issue. With the pornography chapter, Schlosser correctly states that morals cannot and should not be legislated so he manages to provide a little more guidance than he does with the migrant workers problem, but he doesn't say much beyond that.<br />To help give this book a more humanistic side, Schlosser speaks directly to some of the people involved in these underground markets and he includes direct quotes from many of them. This is a good idea, in my opinion, because it helps the reader gain a better understanding for what is going on and what the people involved are thinking as they involve themselves in these illegal activities.<br />Black markets, while illegal and unethical, comprise a large part of the U.S. economy. There is very little that can be done to eliminate them completely. But we, as a nation, can make some moves that would minimize the negative impacts of these underground economies. \\"Reefer Madness\\" does a decent job in showing how much damage can result when business is forced to go into hiding and he does a fair job (although incomplete) in showing what can be done in some instances to lessen the impact of the black market.

Following the attacks on September 11, 2001, the United States and the rest of the world have been forced to cope with the growing reality of religious extremists and their irrational goals to rid the world of anything they perceive as evil.<br />Jessica Stern wrote this book to answer the many questions that people have about terrorist movements that base their philosophy of destruction on religious dogma. She spends the first half of the book providing some background on the type of people who join terrorist organizations, discussing the factors, the demographics, and other conditions that lead a person to want to kill in the name of God. The second part of the book deals with specific people and groups, and it follows Stern as she travels around the globe, meeting face to face with some of the individuals who are members of these radical religious organizations.<br />Stern includes many quotes in this book, and many of them are very extreme and very outspoken, like one would expect from a terrorist. Even though stern is Jewish herself, she doesn't allow this fact to interfere with her desire to complete her study and learn more about these people and their morbid desire to kill. She remains fair and impartial throughout the book, talking like an investigative reporter and then presenting the results of her study in an objective manner with little or no personal opinion thrown in.<br />One thing that really adds to the book's appeal is the fact that Stern includes interviews with people outside of the Muslim world. She talks with radical antiabortionists, like Paul Hill and Michael Bray- two men who see no problem with killing those who perform abortions or blowing up abortion clinics. She talks with members of an Arkansas cult that once had plans to blow up federal buildings. By adding these groups, Stern is able to make the book more complete. It shows that extremists exist everywhere in the world, and some of them might even be your next- door neighbor.<br />\\"Terror in the Name of God\\" is a very good book overall. It takes a complex subject and analyzes it in a sophisticated and intellectual way. It would have been nice if the conclusion was a little longer, but I still enjoyed this book. Stern should be commended for her effort to conduct this type of study while keeping her own personal opinions in check. In many instances, she took great risk when she conducted her study (like meeting one on one with anti- Jewish zealots). But she completed the task regardless. Her book is a good starting point for those who would like to gain a better understanding about what ingredients go into the recipe for creating a radical terrorist. I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in this difficult subject.nd some of them might even be your next- door neighbor.<br />\\"Terror in the Name of God\\" is a very good book overall.

During that time, and during the previous decade, he came to know and love the man who served first as California governor and later as U.S. President during the 1980's, Mr. Ronald Reagan. In this book, he talks about his relationship with the former president, including how they first met, how they formed a friendship, and how their bond remained strong through Reagan's presidency and beyond.<br />Deaver first met Ronald Reagan in 1966 when he was about to run for the governorship of California. It was here that Deaver first got to know Reagan from a political standpoint. Before long, however, the friendship grew beyond politics and Deaver and Reagan became friends for life. They didn't always agree on everything, but they were still able to separate the disputes from the fact that they were still friends. Deaver points out that the Reagan he got to know personally was very different from the image that the public was used to. Reagan was popular with the people and was known for his good looks and sense of humor. He was also perceived as very outgoing, but Deaver indicates that this was not really the case at all. Ronald Reagan was actually rather shy and would prefer to talk with only one or two people at a party rather than work the crowd, like a more gregarious type of personality would do. These facts might surprise some readers who always assumed that Ronald Reagan was the life of the party in any social situation.<br />One thing about this book that makes it a little different from other political books is the fact that it keeps a positive attitude from beginning to end. Unlike other politically influenced books that devote a large number of pages to negative criticism and outright bashing of opponents, \\"A Different Drummer\\" remains optimistic. There is really nothing negative in this book, so don't read it if you are expecting to hear Deaver lash out at Reagan's many enemies or talk openly about Iran Contra or other scandals. It isn't that type of book at all. Deaver focuses on Ronald Reagan as a person, and he remains upbeat and optimistic throughout.<br />Deaver speaks very affectionately about Ronald Reagan, and this fact will turn some people off right away, particularly those who are liberal in their thinking and cannot handle hearing anything positive about Reagan or any other Republican. I admit that Deaver's words can go a little overboard, and they often overflow with excessive admiration. But before a potential reader writes this book off for political reasons, he or she should reconsider. It's true that the book is written about an important political figure, but it isn't really a political book, in the purest sense. It is really a personal book about one man's relationship with a man he admired to the extreme.<br />I didn't necessarily learn a lot more about Ronald Reagan when I read this book. What I learned instead was the power of friendship. Micheal Deaver has known Reagan for more than 30 years. He has been with the president during his highest achievements (like winning the governor's race and the two election victories for the White House) and during his lowest and most difficult personal crises (like his battle with Alzheimer's disease- a very touching part of the book). And through it all, Deaver has remained a friend. \\"A Different Drummer\\" is a nice tribute from Deaver to Reagan, showing how two men can remain loyal and steadfast to the very end. It's not the best book about Ronald Reagan as a whole, since it doesn't cover very much about the president's early life or achievements. But it's a good book about the relationship that formed between these two political allies and how the friendship blossomed and grew over the 30- year period that they worked together. It's full of charm and sincerity, and it makes for a good read regardless of your political affiliation.n's many enemies or talk openly about Iran Contra or other scandals.

It is really a personal book about one man's relationship with a man he admired to the extreme.<br />I didn't necessarily learn a lot more about Ronald Reagan when I read this book. What I learned instead was the power of friendship. Micheal Deaver has known Reagan for more than 30 years. He has been with the president during his highest achievements (like winning the governor's race and the two election victories for the White House) and during his lowest and most difficult personal crises (like his battle with Alzheimer's disease- a very touching part of the book). And through it all, Deaver has remained a friend. \\"A Different Drummer\\" is a nice tribute from Deaver to Reagan, showing how two men can remain loyal and steadfast to the very end. It's not the best book about Ronald Reagan as a whole, since it doesn't cover very much about the president's early life or achievements. But it's a good book about the relationship that formed between these two political allies and how the friendship blossomed and grew over the 30- year period that they worked together. It's full of charm and sincerity, and it makes for a good read regardless of your political affiliation.	2004-03-22

His larger than life persona and his assault on baseball's record books are noteworthy and impressive. But all of his accomplishments have been pushed aside since his banishment from the game he loves. In \\"My Prison Without Walls\\", Rose attempts to confess for his sins, ask for forgiveness, and, hopefully, be given another chance at baseball and the Hall of Fame.<br />Rose spends time in this book talking about his upbringing and the influence of his parents on his infatuation with sports and on his discipline and work ethic. He talks about his rise through the ranks, his pinnacle of success with the Cincinnati Reds, and ultimately his downfall with gambling. Rose finally admits that he did, indeed, gamble on baseball. But he still holds true to his claim that he never placed a bet against his own team. He only bet in favor of them and while this is still against the rules, Rose feels that it's not as bad as it could have been and he is hopeful that he will someday be reinstated to the game he loves so much.<br />Rose shows his remorse for what he did to the game of baseball in this book, but it could easily come across as insincere to some readers. He seems sorry, but not to the level that many will expect. To some, Rose will likely come across as a guy who got caught, lied for a while to cover it up, and now realizes he is running out of time for reinstatement and therefore has no choice but to confess. Further, some readers may question the timing of this book because it seems to be a cheap effort on the part of Rose to profit from this bad situation and his ensuing confession. Personally, I think Rose really is sorry for what he did. But he probably should have stated it differently when he composed this book.<br />The writing used in this book is not the best, and it will be a major league turn- off to those who appreciate good grammar and finely- tuned writing skills. Basically, Rose writes this book the same way he speaks, with words like \\"y'all\\", \\"reckon\\", and other grammatically incorrect lingo. This is the way Rose talks, and this is what you can expect when you read this book.<br />Overall, this book is a mixed bag of good and bad. It isn't written very well and Rose comes across as a little bit conceited throughout as he constantly reminds the reader about his personal accomplishments. However, this is still a decent book to read, to get a much needed perspective on this ongoing saga from the man who has lived it, Mr. Peter Edward Rose.s this book the same way he speaks, with words like \\"y'all\\", \\"reckon\\", and other grammatically incorrect lingo.

Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception	Books	3	57	68	N	Y	Presidential Dishonesty	Author David Corn is a journalist, with contributions to the Nation, Fox News, and several influential newspapers. He has followed the actions of many important leaders during his time in the media. In this book, he presents and elaborates on some of the numerous lies told by President George W. Bush.<br />Corn begins this book by explaining to the reader that all U.S. presidents have done their fair share of lying and he provides examples for a few of them, making sure to cover both Republicans and Democrats so that the reader can see that he is not strictly anti- GOP.  Then, he gets into the heart of the book by first presenting Bush's lies when he was governor, followed by Bush's countless lies he had told when he was a candidate for president, all the way through his first few years as president.<br />Corn devotes separate chapters to different areas of lying. There is a chapter or two on the Bush tax plan, one on his position on stem cell research, one on the Enron scandal, and a few others. But the topic that receives the most coverage in this book is that of the military and, more specifically, the war against Iraq. Corn shows the endless barrage of lies that came from the Bush White House during this time, starting with the fibs about the reasons to go to war (like the weapons of mass destruction claim), then leading to the grossly understated cost of the war and the dishonesty about the casualties and the peace process to rebuild the nation of Iraq.<br />In each chapter, Corn highlights some of the key lies in boldface text, and he places them before the paragraph that the quote appears. There are more lies in this book than just those told by George W. Bush himself. The lies include those told by other members of the Bush administration, like Powell, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and others.<br />Corn does an effective job in his uncovering of these many untruths and with his explanations about each lie. He presents the quote, then he backs up his claim that the quote was false by presenting other quotes and facts that directly contradict what the president or one of his team said. He manages to be respectful throughout the book (as respectful as an author can be, given the subject) and he points out that Bush has told the truth sometimes, too. But the main idea of this book is that Bush is as good of a liar as anyone who has ever held the White House and he will tell any lie necessary if it means getting what he wants.<br />If there is any complaint that I have about this book, it would have to be the fact that most of what it talks about is now old news. Most people already know about the deceptions and falsehoods surrounding the war against Iraq, the Bush tax plan, and other topics. Thus, for those readers who try to stay in tune with the latest political happenings, there won't be very much new to read in this book. Also, in some instances, Corn really seems to be splitting hairs. With a few of the quotes, he tries to make them out to be something far more radical than their speaker intended them to be.<br />I like the way Corn ends the book by presenting some possible explanations on why presidents and other politicians tell so many lies and why the media has been so soft on George W. Bush. Corn feels that journalists need to come down harder on the president and force him to admit the truth. This final chapter is good for those who want a little more insight on why lying is so commonplace and why no one does much about it, although it doesn't go very in- depth in finding an answer.<br />Politicians have always told lies. Nothing is going to change this fact in the foreseeable future. George W. Bush has told more than his share of presidential falsehoods and David Corn exposes many of them in this book, with analysis of each lie, along with facts and quotes to back up his assertion that George W. Bush is one of the greatest liars to ever occupy the oval office. The book isn't perfect, but Corn does present a good resource for the politically misinformed, showing how one man and his administrative team can effectively deceive and mislead the people and change the course of history in the process.or the politically misinformed, showing how one man and his administrative team can effectively deceive and mislead the people and change the course of history in the process.	2004-03-10

From Lincoln, to Hitler, to Roosevelt, there has always been an element of propaganda built into the complex war machine. With the war against Iraq, propaganda has been especially critical to the Bush administration. The use of propaganda in the war against Iraq is the primary focus of this book, \\"Weapons of Mass Deception\\", written by authors Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber.<br />This book centers on several of the basic elements of propaganda: selling the idea to the people, using deceptive statistics, relying on fear to encourage support for war, etc. In each of these areas, the two authors explain how these methods are used, in general, and then how the Bush administration used them to build support for the war against Iraq.<br />One of the primary tasks of the propaganda effort in this war was the act of convincing the people that Iraq had \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" and could attack the U.S. at any time (hence, the title of the book). Now, experts have come forward to claim that the weapons charges were false, adding more validity to the author's claim that this was the main deception of the war. Many critics of the war had doubts about the weapons claim and now this book presents its ideas on how and why the false charges were made. No direct finger pointing takes place, but the authors feel that several military and/or political leaders in the present administration are responsible.<br />It's interesting how politicans use the various deceptions described in this book. Some of the methods are more subtle, like the use of public relations firms to present the most patriotic take possible on everyday issues and events. Others are more direct, like the weapons claim itself. The authors present many of these war deceptions in the book, showing how the Bush administration misled the people into backing the war. The \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" claim was, of course, the biggest deception of all. Many nations have stockpiles of dangerous weapons but the U.S government has never suggested attacking them. But in this case, Bush officials had to convince the people that Iraq was a \\"dangerous enemy\\" that \\"had to be stopped immediately\\" if security would ever have a chance to become reality. The truth is, Iraq had no chance at all against the U.S. military and senior Bush officials knew this well. But the element of fear was useful to convince the public to support the war, so the claim was made nonetheless.<br />This book doesn't provide extensive coverage on the war and the blantant use of propaganda. It's only about 250 pages in length, and once you account for the notes and index, there are only about 210 pages to read. The authors meant for the book to be a reference tool for discovering the various acts of deception without going too deep in its analysis.<br />As a whole, this book makes for a pretty good read. Pro- war individuals will probably not like it, and many will stick by the president's \\"weapons\\" claim no matter what happens. But whether you are pro- war or anti- war, \\"Weapons of Mass Deception\\" is still a book worth reading.

Deprived of liberty and happiness, prisoners waste away most of their lives, confined to a small space devoid of any luxuries.<br />Any prison time would be terrible, but imagine what it would be like to go jail through no fault of your own. And on top of that, imagine what it would be like to be imprisoned based solely on the wrongdoings of another family member and to have this nightmare occur during the prime years of your life (ages 20 to 40). This is the situation that Malika Oufkir finds herself and her family from roughly 1972 to 1994. In this book, \\"Stolen Lives\\" she describes the agony of spending more than two decades either in jail or under house arrest.<br />This book is written by Malika Oufkir and Michele Fitoussi and it covers the young Malika's life preceeding the imprisonment all the way through the mid 1990's, when she was finally released (now in her 40's) and moved to France. The majority of the book centers on the time spent in prison, and it can get very disgusting from time to time. The co- authors talk about the unsanity conditions, the lack of adequate food and drink, the severe lack of medical care, and other agonies associated with serving a prison sentence in the country of Morocco (the Oufkir family's home country).<br />This book has a few suspenseful moments, reaching a climax toward the end when several of the family members escape by building a tunnel and then proceed to Casablanca where they spend several days running from the law. They are finally recaptured, but placed \\"only\\" under house arrest (not as bad as imprisonment, but still not the equivalent of freedom). After a few years, they are released and allowed to leave the country.<br />This book is non- fiction, but it reads like a book of fiction. It's hard to imagine such a contrived situation like this being reality, but it was. The writing of the material, however, doesn't quite measure up to what I expected. I was looking for a more dramatic book, with personal accounts from each surviver and with more suspense and emotion. The authors really don't write the way a fiction expert would, but they at least succeed at keeping one's interest. I did enjoy reading this book, but I would probably have rated it higher if it was a little more personable (not just on the part of Malika, but on the part of the rest of the family as well) and written in a more suspenseful and engaging way. The end of the book (in my opinion, the best part), where they make their escape, is probably the best part of the entire book and one of the few parts that offers a substantial degree of suspense.<br />This book is included in Oprah Winfrey's Book Club, but it's not quite as enjoyable as she makes it out to be. Still, I think the story and the writing are at least worthy of an average rating. It's not a captivating book by any means (like one would expect with a book written about a prison sentence and escape). But it does keep your attention enough to recommend.I was looking for a more dramatic book, with personal accounts from each surviver and with more suspense and emotion.

Government cannot, or should not, interfere with individual practice or show favoritism toward a particular religious faith. This doctrine of freedom has led to the United States becoming the most religiously diverse nation on Earth, and this diverification is openly praised and celebrated in this book, &quot;A New Religious America&quot;.<br />Author Diana Eck is a Harvard professor who is herself affiliated with the Methodist Church. She respects all religious faiths, and she spends time in this book discussing the most significant among them: Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus. Other religious groups get a little bit of mention, but most of the book focuses on these three groups. Eck combines together some historical perspectives along with her own personal experiences as she writes this book. She travels around the country, from mosque to temple, observing directly the traditions and religious practices of these different religions, meeting with leaders and joining in at ceremonies and prayer gatherings.<br />Diana Eck takes a more liberal approach in this book, and this fact might not be to the liking of some readers. It's obvious from the very beginning of this book that Eck fully supports the idea of religious diversity. She never makes a single negative comment about any religious group in her study. She also avoids discussing the merits of the various religious affiliations. Instead, she just states what she knows about each one of them, along with what she experiences first hand, and leaves it at that. She gives the impression that all religions are equally worthy of respect and equally valid.<br />The last part of the book deals with the future and what it has in store for religion in America. Whether people like it or not, religious diversity is a fact of life. The trend toward an even more religiously pluralistic society is already underway as more and more foreign immigrants arrive on America's shores. Mainstream religious groups, secularists, and spiritual folks with no formal affiliation will have to respond to this growing trend if they hope to survive and grow in the new century.ive on America's shores.

But author and spiritualist Neale Donald Walsch claims that he actually has carried on coversations with a higher being, which he includes in this book. He claims that he started to ask questions one day and suddenly, like magic, the pencil started to move on its own while in his hands and God began to answer his questions.<br />Walsch spends much of this book asking God some direct questions about issues that he was burning to find out about. Issues like the morality of sex, the purpose of man on earth, and other modern- day issues are discussed, with Walsch asking short questions and God delivering the answers.<br />According to this book, God is not really what many of us have been led to believe. God enjoys a good joke and is not nearly so serious about things. He is also not the punishing, angry figure that many religions have made him out to be. He is easy- going, and understands how and why humans want to do the things they do.<br />The general response that God seems to make most frequently to Walsch is that the act of being judgemental is probably mankind's greatest fault. It is the act of being judgmental that has caused so many of man's problems and difficulties. If the judgmental attitudes would cease, according to God in this book, most every problem of mankind would disappear.<br />This is a tough book to rate. Some readers will consider this enlightening, while others will consider Walsch to be a heretic. I'm going to play it safe and rate it three stars. It's a most unusual book, and it at least gets one to rethink the way he/she has been led to believe about the person of God and the issue of morality and judgement.	2004-01-13

He has primarily written about popular culture, having authored a book about Bruce Springsteen and one about the conflicts and battles that exist in American culture today. After the success of his book on Bruce Springsteen, Cullen decided to write this book to further study the lives of selected prominent Catholics in the entertainment industry.<br />Cullen devotes chapters to such icons as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Margaret Mitchell (Author of \\"Gone with the Wind\\"), Madonna, and Hollywood director Martin Scorcese. He also includes a few general chapters about Catholicism and its influence on American culture. Cullen attempts to define what the American dream really means and how these different celebrities have been affected by their religious upbringing.<br />Cullen does a good job showing how these different celebrities were influenced by their Catholic background. In the case of Fitzgerald and Mitchell, the influence is more indirect, coming through in the depictions of the characters in their various works. With Madonna and Scorcese, the influence of religion is more direct. Each of these individuals has spoken openly about their respective relationships with the church and the experiences (especially with Madonna) have not always been positive. However, even Madonna admits that she cannot seem to divorce herself from her Catholic upbringing. Its influence can be seen and heard in her songs and in her day to day life.<br />I like the intellectual angle that Cullen takes in this book. It's easy to see that he's a man who is well- educated and knows how to articulate his thoughts onto paper. But I think the book would have been better if it included some well- known individuals in some other walks of life besides entertainment. Cullen is well versed at studying pop culture and this fact, along with the Bruce Springsteen study (who, by the way, was also raised Catholic), are probably what led him to stick with entertainers for the writing of this text.<br />Overall, this is a fairly good book. It won't take long for most people to finish (it's only 165 pages in total length) and the chapter on Madonna is especially interesting.

Quite frequently, when someone talks about religious life in America, it is common to hear news that sounds somewhat negative. \\"America is not quite as religious as was in the past\\", experts say. \\"They don't have the commitment to religious places of worship like they once did and they don't follow the strict moral code of their ancestors\\".<br />Author Robert Fuller is a professor of Religious Studies at Bradley University and he has studied extensively about this \\"flight\\" away from traditional religion. But what Fuller has found is that Americans are still believers in a higher being and they still consider themselves moral beings. The difference between now and then is that today, Americans tend to express their religious feelings in a more inward way, and they don't participate actively in organized religion. This is the new face of religion in America, and it is examined in this book, \\"Spiritual, but not Religious: Understanding unchurched America\\".<br />Fuller points out some revealing statistics that shows the movement of Americans away from tradition houses of worship and over to a more personal relationship with God. Americans don't like the standardized formula that is so prevalent in most churches. They want to express themselves in their own, unique way. And they want to rely more on the power of their own minds to get in touch with spiritual feelings.<br />Fuller writes mostly about the history of spirituality in America and the trends of the past two centuries that have gotten us where we are today. He doesn't dwell much on the present state of spirituality and why Americans are increasingly attracted to this as an alternative to traditional religion. This is one of the drawbacks of the book, in my opinion. It's good to know about the history and how we got where we are. But I would like to know more about the present- day spiritualists and why they feel so strongly about their mode of practice.<br />Fuller presents some good, thought- provoking material on the history of spirituality in America and what we can expect in the future. The nation is becoming more and more diverse all the time, and that includes diversity in religious beliefs as well as in cultural backgrounds. Churches will need to find more and more ways to accommodate these \\"drifters\\" who prefer their own method of religious practice to that of customary churches.

Author Marie Winn has published several books about the medium of television and how it affects families and children. This book, \\"The Plug in Drug\\" was first published more than 25 years ago and has now been updated to include computers and other modern technology. Having been a television addict myself and someone who is interested in what others have to say about the ill effects of excessive TV viewing, I purchased thi book hoping to become enlightened about the destruction that can be caused by overconsumption of television.<br />After reading this book, my feelings are mixed. The author (and the studies she sites from other's works) is decisively anti- television. She points out how families are not as closely- knit as they were in the past and how television viewing has caused kids to lose interest in other activities, like book reading and involvement in sports and outdoor recreation. She even draws the conclusion that the downward trend in SAT test scores can be atrributed to the rise of television viewing and popularity.<br />Breaking the \\"spell\\" of television can be difficult. Parents find that TV viewing acts as a built- in babysitter and is also handy for use as a bribe. It's also much easier to let kids watch TV than to actively take part in other activities with them. This makes it especially tough to turn off the set and look for other, more productive ways to spend time.<br />Winn doesn't call for the outlawing of television, and that's good because if she did, then I would immediately toss this book in the nearest sewer. Instead, she advocates watching television in moderation. She feels that, like anything, television can become addictive and that young children are the most vulnerable. Adults, too, can get hooked on TV but it's the children that are most susceptible to this \\"disease\\".<br />Winn's opinions and her stance on television are sometimes accurate and sometimes a little over the edge. I can agree that, overall, most people watch too much television and that this can certainly take away valuable time that could be spent elsewhere. But I disagree on some of the more radical points, like the suggestion that kid's shows like Sesame Street are useless or that families should try going \\"cold turkey\\" and shutting down the set for good. I can only imagine the negative, rebellious response that would take place in most homes if a television- free environment was proposed by a parent.<br />Overall, this is a decent book to read with a few good points to make about television viewing and keeping this activity in check. There is a good reference section in the back with names, addresses, and web sites of helpful organizations to turn to if you feel that yourself and/or your kids are television junkies. But much like Winn's suggestion that you moderate your TV consumption, you should also moderate how readily you accept her advice. Television has some good points, and there are some good, educational programs to watch. Complete elimination of television is not necessarily a good idea, in spite of what some psychologists and counselors have proposed.

The results of their studies were edited and combined together to form this book, &quot;Religion on Campus&quot;.<br />What these three scholars found is that that most students, in spite of the negative news to the contrary, are still active in religion and they still consider it an important part of their lives. They still believe in a higher power and actively debate the role of religion in society. Students also still belive in going to church (although more of them consider themselves spiritual in the broader sense and don't belong to any church)and in the active support of church- related activities.<br />The authors base these findings on what they saw and heard firsthand during their travels to the different univerisities. However, the fact that they included only four schools makes me a little skeptical. Statistically speaking, one cannot draw any definite conclusions with such a small sample. When you consider the thousands of universities that exist in America, it would be foolish to think that a study of just four of them would be sufficient to declare that American students are more religious than everyone thinks. A larger sample would need to be studied.<br />Another thing I didn't like about this book is the fact that the authors do not disclose the names of the four colleges in the study. They don't disclose the real names of any of the faculty, students, or administrators either. I can fully understand why individuals might not want to be mentioned by name. But I cannot understand the decision to withhold the names of the schools. As I read, I found myself putting the book down every now and then and trying to figure out what colleges they were talking about. This distracted a little from the book itself. I think disclosing the names would have made for a better read and it would have given a study like this one a little more credibility.<br />Authors Conrad Cherry, Amanda Porterfield, and Betty DeBerg are three academic scholars who have studied the topic of religion extensively. They have published many articles and presented their own analysis on the topic of religion and its importance to the members of the public. &quot;Religion on Campus&quot; is a respectable effort to study and present the real story behind American students and how they feel about the subject of religion, but it doesn't include enough colleges to represent a viable cross- section of the different types of colleges and the different types of students that attend them. For this reason, I can only give it a two- star rating. It doesn't go in- depth enough to take seriously.study.

He is very forward and direct, and he is admired by some and loathed by others. In this book, O'Reilly shares some of his best moments from his television show, going nose to nose with political leaders of various stripes and other well- known individuals.<br />Many different guests have appeared on the O'Reilly factor since it first aired and Bill O'Reilly has enjoyed his confrontations to the fullest. In the book, he recaps some of the all- time best encounters, like his chat with James Carville about Bill Clinton's legacy; his talk with John McCain and Barry McCaffrey about the failed drug war; and his controversial spat with actress Susan Sarandon over the police shooting of an unarmed man.<br />Bill O'Reilly likes to claim that he always seeks out the truth. But the fact is that O'Reilly, like most any other television news commentator, does stretch the truth and bend the stories to fit his own perspective. To say that he doesn't use spin is inaccurate. O'Reilly does use spin, it's just his own type of spin. And his personal bias shows over and over again in this book. He comes across as conceited and pompous; entirely convinced that he is right and unwilling to compromise or even admit that maybe, just maybe, he might not be correct on some issues.<br />Some of O'Reilly's views are dead- on, and they will give many readers a sense of satisfaction, knowing that somebody finally had the guts to make these types of statements. Other views are a little more spotty and will make readers wonder how a guy who seems fairly bright one moment can make a complete turnaround and say something so absurd. A good example of this is the chapter on the failed drug war, where O'Reilly tries to convince the reader that drug use can be eradicated if we impose stiffer penalties. The fact is, of course, we ALREADY impose stiff penalties. It doesn't seem to make any difference in winning the insane war on drugs. Poor little Bill seems to believe that, with the right number of laws passed, we can successfully repeal the laws of supply and demand.<br />This book lacks the humor that was so commonplace in O'Reilly's first book, &quot;The O'Reilly Factor&quot;. This book is more serious and more in- your- face. It gets obnoxious from time to time, but O'Reilly does, at least, present some interesting and thought- provoking views on the critical issues of the day while he goes head- to- head with some of the most popular names in politics and show business.we ALREADY impose stiff penalties.

These guys are known mostly for their contributions to human progress but they also have one more thing in common: they all grew up and/or lived in the city of Dayton, Ohio, when they achieved greatness. Author Mike Bernstein wrote this book in 1996 to commemorate the bicentennial of the city of Dayton and to celebrate the many native men who helped change the world.<br />Much of this book is spent talking about John Patterson, the former head of NCR (known as National Cash Register in those days), and his business practices and personal conduct that thrust him into the national spotlight. The Wright Brothers also get extensive coverage in this book, with Bernstein talking about not only the invention of powered flight, but also the personalities that made the Wright Brothers unique. You complete your reading feeling like you know about them as people and not just as two guys who were good mechanics.<br />Bernstein includes many black and white photos throughout the book, showing some of the factories, the people, and the inventions that put Dayton, Ohio, on the national map. He doesn't include any color photos. He gives the book an historic feel by including photos exactly as they were taken in the early part of the twentieth century.<br />Dayton, Ohio is still known by many as the birthplace of aviation. But it was also a hotbed of other activities and inventions. Author Mike Bernstein explains these complex men and the ambition and drive that propelled each of them to national prominence. These men were all unique and important to the progress of mankind. But most of all, they were &quot;grand eccentrics&quot;- men who were out of the ordinary and who didn't allow conventional thinking to stand in the way of innovation. This book describes them well, showing how the combination of determination and zeal led these inventors to accomplish so many great things.termination and zeal led these inventors to accomplish so many great things.	2003-11-19

He has traveled all over America and the world, attending events, visiting breweries, and tasting beer. He has extensive knowledge on the subject of beer and he shares that knowledge in this book.<br />Jackson writes this book in a very simple, easy to understand manner. He doesn't use long words that require the use of a dictionary to understand. He keeps it simple while he educates the reader sbout the subject of beer. He begins by talking about the history of the world's greatest beverage, from the ancient days when beer was discovered all the way to the present day and the resurgence of craft- brewing. He talks about the various ingredients used in beer and explains how best to match beer with food. The bulk of the book covers each individual style of beer, with facts, trivia, and full- color photographs of beer labels, breweries, and other beer- related things.<br />Speaking of the photography, I found that it really adds to the enjoyment and understanding of the subject matter. It would not be very exciting to read a book about beer that contained nothing but text. The pictures really make a difference with this type of book. They keep the reader entertained and informed about different aspects of beer and the brewing industry.<br />Overall, this is one of the best books on beer I have ever read. Grab a copy and see for yourself how much there is to know and love about the greatest beverage known to man- beer!	2003-11-19

Through his work in the legal system, he has witnessed the corruption, the injustice, and the overall insanity of the War on Drugs. He wrote this book as an educational piece and as a call to political action.<br />Gray presents dozens of quotes from individuals in government, in law, and in other walks of life who have observed the failures of the drug war and know that the laws against drug use are actually more harmful than the drugs themselves. Gray shows how the drug laws have been used to justify expansion of government power and erosion of civil liberties. He shows how drug laws corrupt law enforcement officials and often lead to early paroling of violent criminals in order to make room in prison cells for non- violent drug offenders. Most politicians refuse to touch this issue (with a few exceptions, like former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson) out of fear. They worry how the ignorant, misinformed public will respond so they just push the issue under the table and hope it doesn't resurface during election time.<br />One of the most indicting facts about the pro- drug war radicals is the fact that they usually refuse to debate anti- drug war advocates in a public forum. Death- loving extremists, like the evil former drug czar Barry McCaffrey, refuse to debate these issues. This intimidation of taking on an anti- drug war individual speaks volumes. If the pro- drug war forces really felt their message was srong, they would have no problem having a debate and, in fact, would likely welcome one. But Gray points out that he is usually shunned when he approaches one of these drug war supporters with an invitation for an open debate.<br />Gray presents many angles of the drug issue in this book, and then he follows his words with a defined plan of action. He doesn't necessarily push his own views as the only ones that are valid. Rather, he presents the facts and lets the reader decide, confident in the fact that most anyone who knows the facts will likely take the side against continuing the insane war on drugs.<br />Gray wrote this book as a wake up call. The crazy war on drugs has caused endless amounts of human tragedy while making many people (drug kingpins, law enforcement, lawyers, etc.) very rich. It's no wonder that these people want to keep the war going. It has nothing to do with morals or justice. They don't want to see an end to the flow of funds into their already oversized wallets. But something has to be done. If the failed war on drugs is not ended soon, Gray fears that more and more civil liberties and privacy rights will be lost and the United Stated will continue to send a larger and larger portion of its population to serve time in jail, which will do absolutely nothing to curtail drug use and will result in more and more expansions of government power and control. His book is outspoken and gets right to the heart of the matter, and I highly recommend reading this book to anyone who has even the slightest interest in law, politics, and justices own views as the only ones that are valid.

In this book, Fodor's assembles together a state by state listing of all the various units of the National Park system, complete with facts and information to help you plan a visit.<br />This guide is divided up among regions, and then by state, with a map showing the approximate location of each park within the state followed by a brief description of what the park has to offer. Be aware that the information contained in this book is very brief. It's intended to help you find a park and quickly let you know what to expect, whether camping is permitted, which interstate highway is closest, etc. The data is not in- depth. It's only meant to quickly summarize the units of the U.S. National Park system. Also, you should keep in mind that the guide does not include photographs of all the parks. The only pictures are those found in the center of the guide, where Fodor's includes a photo section with pictures from about 35 or 40 different parks.<br />Overall, this is a very good guide, in spite of its lack of detail and pictures. It makes a good addition to the glove compartment of any automobile that spends a good portion of the year driving across the United States of America.

Much of the show's success can be attributed to the host and resident sexpert, Suzie J, but there are others who worked behind the cameras, in the sound room, in the call screening area, and all around the set to make the show the smooth- running operation that it appears to be. In this book, &quot;Nocturnal Admissions&quot;, authors RJ Gulliver and Julie Smith (two people who also work on the show) take the reader backstage to meet the folks who help bring Talk Sex into the living rooms of millions.<br />This book is part biography, part social tabloid. There is one full chapter that covers Sue herself, discussing her young life and her brief stint as a nurse and later a radio talk show host. It was the latter that led her to the television screen. Her phone- in radio show was successful to the point that a television producer decided it would also perform high in the television ratings. He gave Sue her chance, and the show took off like a bursting prophylactic.<br />The rest of the book presents a humorous look at the other people on the show and some of the funny moments that have taken place on the set, both on camera and off. Finding someone on the show to test the various sex toys is often hilarious, and so are some of the interesting phone calls that sexually curious people call in and ask Sue. Some of the best ones are highlighted in the book. Some of the individual crew members are discussed briefly, too, along with a few black and white photos so you can match a name to a face.<br />Watching Talk Sex gives one the feeling that Sue is just about the only person involved in the making of the show. Nothing could be further from the truth as RJ Gulliver explains in the pages of &quot;Nocturnal Admissions&quot;. This book lets you get a feel (no pun intended) for the people, the hectic schedule, and the hard work that goes into the production of a live television show. Sue might be the main star, but there are plenty of people who go out of their way to make sure that sexual education remains an inportant part of your weekly viewing pleasure.hard work that goes into the production of a live television show.

From her early days as a young girl in Illinois, all the way to her run for the U.S. Senate, Ms. Clinton lets the reader know about her life experiences, up close and personal.<br />This book has its moments. I particularly enjoyed the candid feedback regarding some of her husband's political enemies, like Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, and others. It was interesting to read some of Newt's comments about the Monica Lewinsky debacle that he told Hillary in private. Basically, he stated that it was disgusting that these charges were brought against Bill, but as the primary torch- bearer of the Republican Party, he had to follow through and lead the impeachment proceedings. Whether or not Newt's comments are completely true is unknown, but it wouldn't surprise me if they were.<br />This book centers on a few key areas of Hillary's life: her youth, attending college and meeting Bill, and her husbands (and her) frequent runs for political office. Hillary is very open and opinionated regarding her feelings in the various scandals (Whitewater, Filegate, and so on) and she defends herself and her husband to the very end. While I agree that many of the \\"scandals\\" were outrageous and were instigated by political enemies trying to bring her husband down, I don't agree that the Clinton's were entirely innocent of everything. I also find it interesting that Hillary makes no mention at all of the one scandal that really WAS serious- the alleged selling of secrets to the Chinese. She makes no mention of this at all. As a former lawyer herself, I think she was wise to avoid this topic completely.<br />Hillary's views are very political, and she makes no apologies for how she feels. But her personal relationships and the mixing of politics gets a little old after a while. Throughout the book, she describes fellow Democrats as \\"incredible\\", \\"very intelligent\\", \\"a superb human being\\", etc., almost to the point of elevating them to deity. But with Republicans, she cannot bring herself to muster up even one nice complement. And that includes ALL Republicans- not just those who were known political enemies.<br />I don't like the way this book changes direction so quickly. One minute, Hillary is talking about a mission to a foreign nation and a meeting with a foriegn head of state. Then, out of nowhere, she inserts a paragraph about how she and Chelsea spent a holiday. Suddenly, the writing returns to the meeting with the foreign leader. A little more focus and consistency would have made this a better book.<br />Taken as a whole, this is a good book to read. Most people of the Republican persausion will not like it at all and most of them will not even bother to pick it up. But I think it's a decent book, with some good insight and good perspectives from the woman who spent eight years in the White House with her scandal ridden husband- Eight years of \\"Living History\\".\\"very intelligent\\", \\"a superb human being\\", etc., almost to the point of elevating them to deity.

Rockefeller, Sr.	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Tycoon, Businessman, Philanthropist	When people think about businessmen in the United States who have had a significant impact on the commerce, politics, etc. of the country, the one man who comes to mind most frequently has to be John D. Rockefeller. This man, who rose from lower- middle class beginnings, had a business sense that could be ruthless and overbearing. He was the world's first ever billionaire, a sum of money that made him FILTHY rich in the world of the late 1800's and early 1900's. &quot;Titan&quot;, written by author Ron Chernow, examines the life and times of Mr. Rockefeller from his birth all the way to his death in the early 1900's.<br />Everyone already knows that Rockefeller was rich beyond imagination and that his Standard Oil business was gigantic and monopolistic. But there are many other facts about this man that few have heard about. Chernow is good at finding these facts and presenting them to the reader, showing that Rockefeller was only human and possessed flaws just like anyone else. Who would have known, for example, that the pious John D. Rockefeller had a father who was nicknamed &quot;Devil Bill&quot; for his wild and deceptive lifestyle? Or that this man who was so successful at business was actually rather shy and reclusive in many ways? Or that Rockefeller was the founder of the University of Chicago? Chernow points out many interesting and mostly unheard of facts about Rockefeller and his personal relationships throughout his biography.<br />Rockefeller had some unusual ideas about politics and social conservatism. Even though the United State's system of free enterprise and liberty was responsible for his individual success, he was still prone to using force to obtain his own social goals. The one area where he was the most determined to have his will made into law was with prohibition. Rockefeller believed (falsely, of course) that the elminination of alcohol was going to somehow turn the nation into a moral utopia and empty out all of our prison cells. In reality, of course, the opposite was true and Chernow covers Rockefeller's obsession with prohibition (and religion) throughout his writing. This ludicrous belief that government should control what one chooses to drink runs contrary to Rockefeller's supposed belief in liberty and it shows that, while he was definitely skilled in the business world, he was not all that bright or logical in other areas.<br />If there's one complaint that I have with this book, it would have to be the length. At more than 800 total pages, this book can take a very long time to read and it sometimes goes a little overboard in its coverage. Do I really need to know Rockefeller's every thought? Or his daily regimen? Chernow is very thorough, but in being thorough he also goes a bit far and this could make the book a little boring for some readers.<br />John D. Rockefeller's name conjures up many images to many people. Some admire his tenacity to succeed. Some like the fact that he always held on to his moral convictions. Others think he was a ruthless, heartless tyrant and a hyprocrite. But whether you like him or not, there's no denying that John D. Rockefeller was a giant in American Business- a Titan who was larger than life in his day and age. Author Ron Chernow examines the full life of this man from Cleveland, explaining his business relationships, personal relationships, and his philosophy on life, business, and government. It's a long read and it will take a while to finish. But I can almost guarantee that you will come away with a new understanding of Mr. Rockefeller after reading &quot;Titan&quot;.

She feels that government has gone way too far in the past few decades in its attempt to govern and control every facet of our lives. In this book, \\"Don't Shoot the Bastards..Yet\\", Wolfe lists 101 ways that individuals can still salvage a little bit of freedom from an ever- intrusive government before it's time to let the weapons do the talking.<br />Wolfe writes about several different topics, and her style jumps from serious to humorous throughout this writing. But the area where she seems to be the most gung- ho on individual liberty is with gun ownership. Wolfe recommends owning guns- lots of guns- as one of the primary means of thwarting off any final attempt from government to take away any more rights. She has other recommendations too, but the gun issue pops up the most frequently. Wolfe believes (like many other political thinkers) that gun rights are the most critical of all because once the guns are confiscated, there will be no means available to fight off oppressive government force if/when the nation turns into a total police state.<br />This book might seem radical at first and in many ways, it is. But it's not radical to the point of violence. Wolfe reminds the reader over and over again that she is NOT an advocate of force. She just wants the public to know that there are many ways to salvage freedom that are non- violent, easy to do, and completely free (or almost free) of any cost.<br />Wolfe wrote this book as a follow up to \\"101 Things to do 'til the Revolution\\". This book is written in a similar fashion, with a numeric listing of \\"things\\" to do. They aren't in any particular order, and the vary widely in length (some are less than one page, some are several pages long). But they all drive home the same point: America is not as free as it once was and unless government officials realize this fact and take action to restore liberty, it's only a matter of time until a revolution takes place. And at that time, the guns and the freedom- loving Americans who own them could very well come out of hiding.<br />Read this book, and see for yourself how you can regain some of your lost liberty!f time until a revolution takes place.

Are the stereotypes of this lifestyle accurate? Is one's happiness directly corelated to his/her income level?<br />Author Barbara Ehrenreich sets out on an adventurous mission in this book, \\"Nickel and Dimed\\". She spends several months working various odd jobs that are normally associated with the working poor, like restaurants, maid service, retail, etc. She explains what it was like to try to make a living in these type of occupations; how the supervisors and other corporate people treated the workers; and how the other workers behaved whom she got to know on the job.<br />One thing I noticed right away is that Ehrenreich intended this as much more than just a book of adventure. This writing has definite political overtones. Ehrenreich seems to think that government should step in, wave its magic wand, and somehow make life better for everyone. She supports rent control, minimum wage increases, and all sorts of government intervention to make the lives of these individuals \\"less miserable\\".<br />But are these people really all that miserable? Ehrenreich doesn't show any contempt toward her fellow workers, but she is convinced that they all live sad, pathetic lives and need to be rescued from this existance. I disagree with her on many of her observations. I once worked in restaurants, and I don't agree at all with her synopsis of the lifestyles of food service workers. Yes, there are some who are not happy. But the majority of them realize that low- wage jobs are the place that most everyone starts out and they learn to make the best of it. From my experience in fast- food, I recall having fun with my fellow employees; hosting parties; goofing off at work; joking about things; talking about the future; etc. There was no more sadness there, in the realms of the fast- food industry, then there is where I work right now, where the wages are much higher.<br />I respect Ehrenreich for her ambition to temporarily join the ranks of the working poor and then publish a book about it. But I think the core problem with this book is that Ehrenreich is too far removed from the working poor to make a fair assessment of their plight. She is a member of the upper class, and I think her own social standing blurred her vision to some degree. It made things seem much worse than they really were because the conditions were so different from what she is used to. This book would have been better, and more fair, if the task of living among the working poor had been undertaken by someone closer to that level- like, say, someone currently in the middle class. This type of individual would be closer in rank to the working poor and would be able to make clearer judgements.<br />Overall, this is an average book that definitely has its moments. Ehrenreich is naive and misguided if she really thinks that government is going to magically solve the problems of the working poor. She's also very ignorant of economics and other facts of business and free markets (she makes some really brainless statements about economics and wage rates in one of the chapters). On the other hand, she makes some good points about other issues of our day, like the constituional violation of rights that takes place when employees are subjected to mandatory drug testing.<br />In spite of its occasional stupidity and its obvious political leanings toward government intervention, this is a good book to read. It's fun to read as Ehrenreich roams around the country from job to job, directly experiencing what it's like to scrape out a living, making only sustenance wages. \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" reminds us all of the plight of the working poor as they struggle to make ends meet.

These two people have been involved in top corporate management for many years, working with Pepsi Co., FTD Florist, and others. They wrote this book to stress the importance of trust between all levels of management and the immediate employees.<br />Just how important is trust in a corporation? Well, the authors think it ranks at the very top of the list because it is through trust that all other corporate activites (in the business sense) are based. The first part of this book gives an overview of trust, followed by a section that identifies the tools of trust. Proper conduct of a trusted leader is discussed next, followed by a troubleshooting guide of sorts, that explains what to do when key individuals leave; how to handle crises involving trust; and how to repair the damage when trust is lost. There's even a self- assessment questionnaire that you can take to estimate the level of trust in your company.<br />I like the way the authors of this book progress from defining the issue, to demonstrating how trusted leaders behave, to identifying problems and, finally, to offering solutions. They cover most of the important areas except for one: they don't really address the fact that most managers do, indeed, tell lies. In some cases the lies told are critical to the success of the company (like in the case of not talking about a new product currently in development). In other cases, the lies told are required as part of the job (for example, pretending that the director's plan of action is great when the manager knows in his heart that it's not). These situations can affect trust in adverse ways, but the authors do not touch on these issues.<br />Management books are often a little bit slow to read and sometimes can be rather repetitive in nature. This book is no exception. I found certain parts rather dull, and I had to make myself determined to finish. I kept nodding off as I tried to read. After so long, I got really tired of reading the word \\"trust\\". I know that trust is the main subject of the book, but it still got repetitive after a while.<br />Trust in the corporate arena is very important for the success of a business. When I think back to the past few years and all the examples of corporate mismanagement, especially with Enron, it's easy to see why the authors of this book really drive home the point that trust DOES matter! Without it, a company is doomed to fail.tried to read. After so long, I got really tired of reading the word \\"trust\\".

The elder Meijer came over from his home country of the Netherlands in 1907, ready to start a new life in the United States of America. In this book, grandson Hank tells the story of how his grandfather came to America, dabbled in several different businesses, and ultimately decided that selling groceries and general merchandise was his calling in life.<br />Hank Meijer writes this book very well, covering not just the business itself and the significant highs and lows that come with entepreneurship, but also Hendrick Meijer's personal life and beliefs. He includes the actual script from several of his grandfather's letters to his soon to be wife, Zien, back when she was still in the Netherlands and he was in America. The letters are full of love and hope, and they show just how close the couple was in heart, despite the long distance between them.<br />Hank spends considerable time talking about the various businesses that his grandfather experimented with, leading up to his opening of the first Meijer &quot;Superstore&quot;. Hendrick tried out farming, milk delivery, and barbershop grooming. But he enjoyed the food business the best and he decided to open up a small grocery store. Over time, he decided that it would be a good idea to combine the grocery store concept with a discount store, and the superstore was born. It was Meijer, not Wal- Mart, that created the superstore concept.<br />Hendrick Meijer's story is inspirational. He shows that, in the United States of America, dreams really can come true. &quot;Thrifty Years&quot; is a tribute to this man and the legacy he left behind. Hank Meijer deserves credit for writing such an excellent family biography. His grandfather would be very, very proud!	2003-07-31

Many individuals have come forward and given their best interpretation of what took place; why it happened; and what needs to be done to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself in the future.<br />In this book, \\"The Federal Siege at Ruby Ridge\\", we finally get to hear the story from two of the people who were present during the armed assault: Randy Weaver and his daughter Sara. I met Randy Weaver in person once, and I received an autographed copy of this book. Weaver explains, in his own words, how he was framed by government agents; how they continuously lied to him and others; how they killed two members of his family; and how the media distorted the event by making the Weavers seem like extremists and the government officials look like heroes.<br />Randy and Sara Weaver spend most of their writing in the book reliving the events that took place, leading up to the siege and during the siege itself. They are quite candid and graphic, so you need to keep this in mind if you decide to read. The personal dimension of the book, however, ends in chapter 11. Here, the book moves into the Senate hearings following the siege. This part of the book can get rather monotonous and there is no suspense to it because we already know how it ends: Weaver is cleared of most all the charges brought against him, with the assistence of attorney Gerry Spence and several federal employees of the FBI and BATF are indicted on various charges.<br />This book isn't the best written literary volume I've ever experienced. There are several typos and the grammar doesn't always flow smoothly from one sentence to the next. It's also arranged rather haphazardly, with chapters and topics jumping around in all directions with each flip of a page. But it's still a good book, exposing the brutality of federal agents and presenting a fresh perspective from two of the family members who managed to survive this terrible event.who managed to survive this terrible event.	2003-07-30

Are girls getting short-changed and left out in the field of academia? Do teachers favor boys and view them as more intelligent than they do the opposite sex?<br />Author Christina Hoff- Sommers wrote this book, \\"The War Against Boys\\" as a warning to all Americans about the plight of boys at the hands of unruly feminists. Feminist leaders are constantly trying to convince the world that girls get the short end of the stick when it comes to academic opportunities and that the educational system in the U.S. is biased in favor of men. They also feel that violence is inherent in all men and that the only solution is to get men in touch with their feminine side, to expel the threat of violence.<br />Sommers, and most other professionals, know that these claims and solutions are complete hogwash. As she points out in her book, it is actually boys, not girls, who fare more poorly in school. It is boys, not girls, who are in need of additional guidance. You would never know this by listening to the outcries from feminist leaders who still want you to believe that girls are not getting a fair deal in the world of education.<br />Sommers did a pretty good job in writing this book, but I wish she had made an extra effort to propose possible solutions to the problem. Political leaders usually avoid the issue of boys and the possibility of spending public funds to help them because they fear being attacked by feminists and labeled as being sexist. So, without the help of political leaders, who can we count on to find a remedy to the problem that boys face in America's schools? Feminists try to say that the solution is to make boys more like girls by encouraging them to play with dolls, wear girl's clothing, etc. We all know this is crazy and so does Sommers. But she doesn't offer any concrete solutions to the problem in her book.<br />Sommers spends a lot of time countering the absurd views of feminist Carol Gilligan, a woman with a distinct political and social agenda. Gilligan wants to eliminate the desire among boys to be competitive, and part of her reasons for this include a political belief that we should abandon capitalism as our economic system in the United States and embrace a more socialistic/Marxist system. Her reason for targeting young boys is simple: get them while their young, when they are the most impressionable and the easiest to influence.<br />I don't feel that this threat from feminists is as strong as the author does. But it's nice that she took the time to write this book, exposing some of the wild and wacky proposals from feminists to re-engineer young boys and make them more like girls. Sommers has a lot of courage, and she has undoubtedly added some more names to her professional enemies list by writing this book. She does a good service to everyone in exposing these outrageous feminist agendas.istinct political and social agenda.

Exactly what is it that makes one company stand out among others as a symbol of effective and efficient management? What factors are the most critical to long term success? Why do some companies seem to succeed so easily while others can barely keep their heads above water?<br />In \\"Good to Great\\", author Jim Collins and his team of research specialists attempt to answer these and other questions about corporate management. These individuals conducted hundreds of interviews and gathered together thousands of statistics on corporations in all sorts of different industries in order to compile a list of companies that exemplify excellence in corporate management.<br />The companies that are highlighted in this book earned their coveted rating based on their ability to outperform companies in similar industries after first undergoing a period of turmoil. The eleven \\"superstar\\" companies are: Abbott, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Phillip Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo. In each instance, these companies experienced a period of time where growth and financial prospects looked bleak. Then, they responded with expert planning and a sound managerial vision and came back stronger than ever before.<br />Besides these 11 success stories, Collins also highlights some companies who failed to respond quickly enough to market changes and ended up in the trash heap of corporate history. An example here is the grocery chain A&P. This once successful company was reduced to nothing and eventually closed its doors for good because its management team refused to recognize the need to change and adapt to new market conditions and management changes. Had it responded more quickly and embraced change, A&P might still be among the largest U.S. companies. But its management failed to adapt, and it went bankrupt.<br />This is a very good management book overall, and its data is backed up by concrete figures. What you get in this book are the cold hard facts, not merely the opinions of the author. Collins doesn't just ramble on about his own personal feelings on management and why he thinks one company is better than the others. He lets the track record speak for itself.<br />Author Jim Collins and his team deserve a lot of credit for writing this insightful, well- researched book about corporate management. It would have been nice if he had expanded his writing to include more than just these 11 \\"superstar\\" companies. Still, \\"Good to Great\\" is one of the better management books that I have read in the past several years. It provides valuable insight into what works and what doesn't work in the world of corporate management.e cold hard facts, not merely the opinions of the author.

He doesn't like the government's excesses of control, the lying, the manipulation, and the almost complete disregard for the constitution. A strong proponent of individual liberty and personal responsibility, Vin covers many topics in this book that relate to government run amok, all with an inspired fervor and a very Libertarian angle.<br />Starting with the first chapter, Vin talks about where Americans have gone wrong since the founding fathers established the constitutional framework that suited the nation well for so many years. Juries are now &quot;stacked&quot; in an attempt to control the outcome of a trial; guns are confiscated in direct violation of the second amendment; people are sent to prison just because they choose to smoke a plant; and school children are indoctrinated to ensure that they are all slaves to the supreme command of the state, from now and into the future.<br />After commenting directly on the miserable failure of these various government policies, Vin describes countless examples of how government power has been used to manipulate individuals and destroy their lives. You can read all about hard working Americans who had their rights trampled on by government, like a man who saw his farm business wrecked by government officials who declared areas of his farm a wetland, and refused to allow him to farm on it, then refused to allow it to be used for other purposes either, making it worthless. Another true story covers a woman who was harassed by government because she refused to lie (yes, you heard me correctly) and disclose inaccurate ingredient listings on her company's pet foods.<br />Vin also talks about the government debacle at Waco and he gives sound reasons for why, he believes, the government is solely responsible for the deaths of the Branch Davidian members. He talks about the failed war on drugs, pointing out how government has used this disastrious policy to erode individual liberty.<br />Suprynowicz is a very outspoken person, and his in- your- face style might make some people uncomfortable. He frequently resorts to sarcasm and he provides countless examples of how government has ruined people's lives through its ruthlessness and its total failure to follow the constitution.<br />&quot;Send in the Waco Killers&quot; is well- written and easy to understand. Vin is a skilled wirter who knows exactly how to take an ordinarily complex situation and state it in a way that will make sense to most anyone. This book is one of the best I have read, and it was even recognized by freemarket.net as the &quot;Freedom Book of the Year&quot; in 1999.

Founded by Adolph Coors, a Prussian stowaway to America, the Coors Company has been in existance now for more than 100 years and during that time, it has often found itself thrust into the spotlight over problems with employees, political involvement, and family crises and disputes.<br />Author Dan Baum spends a little bit of time talking about the foundation of the company, then he heads directly into the 20th century, discussing at length the Coor's family members (Bill, Joe, Adolph II, Adolph III, Peter, Joe, and others) and their various business philosophies and personal lives. As most people know, the Coors family has always had problems with organized labor, and the company has been the target of strikes and boycotts by various pro- labor and ethnic groups. Accused of being anti- labor, anti- gay, sexist, and racist, the Coors Company has been forced to face a never- ending onslaught of criticism from various civil and political groups. Author Dan Baum covers many of these important issues thoroughly, while managing to leave out his own opinions, allowing the reader to digest the information and make his/her own decision.<br />Reading a book like will make some people a little bit annoyed at the Coors family and its beliefs. The labor problems are one thing, but there are other issues that the author covers which are just as controversial. For example, it is known that Coors was very slow to accept the changes in the marketplace in the 1970's, when the other big brewers, Miller and Anheuser- Busch, were both switching to a brand marketing emphasis. Coors could visibly see the changes, but refused to make any moves until it was almost too late. Bill Coors, in particular, is incredibly rigid, refusing to even consider producing and selling a light beer, even though other family members and marketing experts all warn him that change is necessary if the Coors Company has any hope to survive.<br />The book ends by talking about the modern era. Coors is still around, but the boycotts and other problems have taken a toll. The company is no longer family run, like it was in the past. Now, Coors is directed by professionals who have managed to expand the product line, allocate more money toward marketing and sales, and have rescued the company from bankruptcy.<br />\\"Citizen Coors\\" is a very good read. It has its share of tragedy (Adolph Coors I and great- granddaughter Missy both committed suicide and Adolph III was murdered) but it also has its share of success. Coors is credited for inventing the aluminum can and for encouraging recycling on a massive scale. Above all, though, \\"Citizen Coors\\" shows the importance of accepting change. If Coors had acted more quickly, it could possibly be a much larger brewer than it is today, rivaling A-B for the top spot in the industry. A little more flexibility and open- mindedness could have worked wonders.ry if the Coors Company has any hope to survive.<br />The book ends by talking about the modern era.

She has written several books relating to this subject and many of them become best- sellers. In this book, Coulter exposes (or attempts to expose) what she feels are some of the key problems with liberals and the liberal way of thinking.<br />Does Coulter score a knock- out punch? Well, not really. Some of her points are valid and they make sense, while others are not very logical and are often hypocritical. It's true, for example, that liberals, in general, control the media and promote government programs. It's also true that they deliberately attack conservatives whenever the opportunity arises yet they treat liberals with much greater leniency, even when a conservative and a liberal candidate for office have done or spoken exactly the same thing. There is a definite liberal bias in the media, and every one knows it.<br />Coulter makes other claims, howver, that are a little misguided and she also sticks her own foot in her mouth on several occasions. There's one part in the book where she is talking about the \\"Religious Right\\" and trying to rationalize with the reader that this group is not really a threat. Why? because it doesn't have an official headquarters with leaders and other officials! This is a little bit silly, and I'm surprised that Coulter cannot see her own foolishness. Just because there is no official organization doesn't mean that a particular group should be excused from its political undertakings and written off as harmless. It's a known fact that the Religious Right tends to be conservative and its members have taken pride in the fact that they have helped swing elections in favor of conservatives and have helped to push through their own theocratic- laden legislation into several state law books. It makes no difference whether the group has an official organization or not and Coulter knows this. She is only defending them because the members are mostly conservatives.<br />I don't like the fact that Coulter resorts to so much name calling in this book. It makes her a hypocrite, in my opinion, because she is engaing in exactly the same bevahior that she claims is so wrong with liberals. I also don't like the fact that she claims to be so pro- liberty, yet she supports such government intrusiveness and anti- liberty policies as the war on drugs and other things.<br />This is the type of book that will get mixed reviews. I recommend reading it only if you're a dyed- in- the- wool Republican or if you have strong conservative leanings. Otherwise, Ann's bashing of liberals in general will really get under your skin.mostly conservatives.<br />I don't like the fact that Coulter resorts to so much name calling in this book.

Author Robert Patterson is an experienced military man who spent time in the Clinton White House, following the ex- president wherever he went and carrying the nuclear football containing the secret information needed to launch an attack. He got to know the president on a personal level and a professional level, and while he liked the president personally, he did not like Clinton's negative attitude toward the military.<br />Patterson feels that Clinton's indifference toward taking appropriate military action and his loathing of the armed forces in general led to the attacks on September 11, 2003. Patterson is especially disturbed at the \\"blown opportunity\\" back in the late 1990's when U.S. security forces had Osama Bin Laden within striking range and could have easily taken him out but couldn't because of Clinton. They needed the official approval from the president before they could strike, and Clinton could not make up his mind. Before long, the opportunity had passed. Patterson feels that this lack of action led to the fatal attacks in the Fall of 2001. He doesn't make an outright accusation, but you can tell that this is how he feels.<br />Could taking the appropriate military action have thwarted these attacks on the U.S.? No one will ever know for certain. Personally, I think the attacks would have occurred regardless. People may not like Osama Bin laden, but he is no dummy. He knew he was a marked man and that he could be killed at any time. I'm certain that he had a back up plan, in case of his death, to carry out the attacks as planned.<br />Overall, this book is a decent one, but it's a little too short to take it as seriously as I would like. Clinton- bashers will love it, and so will those who are strong supporters of a large military. It's a little bit too short, in my opinion, to be completely effective. But it's a pretty good book that makes you wonder how history might have changed if Clinton had taken quick, decisive action when the opportunity was present.present.	2003-07-07

In \\"Useful Idiots\\", Charen summarizes what she believes are the major flaws in liberal thinking and she includes examples and direct quotes to back up her thinking.<br />In some respects, Charen's criticisms seem valid and she explains them reasonably and effectively. It is true, for example, that the liberal media often shows sympathy toward Communism and Socialism. Always ready to embrace the idea that bigger government is better, it's common to see news stories where members of the liberal media elite will try to sway viewers and/or readers into believing that conditions are not really all that bad in Communist countries like Cuba and that America is really the place where poverty and mistreatment of the poor is widespread. This is, of course, complete nonsense but the media always tries to paint a semi- rosy picture of Communism, no matter how bleak the true story really looks. Charen is correct when she points out this stupidity, and she backs up her claims with proof.<br />In other areas, though, I have to question Charen's assumption that the liberal who spouted off some outrageous claim is necessarily an \\"idiot\\" for doing so. Charen has dozens and dozens of quotes in this book from prominant liberals and many of them do, indeed, sound rather idiotic at first. But what Charen doesn't explain is the reason behind the statements. For instance, Charen points out the stupidity of Walter Mondale in 1984, when he tried to say that nuclear war is the greatest threat the U.S. and the world will ever face and that it's an issue that will define whether or not we live or die in the near future. Yes, it's true that Mondale did make statements to this effect. But Charen makes no mention at all that this could have been (and most likely was) motivated by politics. She just sticks with the assumption that Mondale is an idiot to say something like this. Politicians, as we all know (I hope!), are liars by nature. In 1984, Walter Mondale faced a task that was probably even more impossible than winning a nuclear war: He was trying to defeat the immensely popular Ronald Reagan for the presidency. Mondale had to come up with some issue to use in the race for the White House that was scary enough to possibly muster up a few more percentage points in the polls. He decided to choose the possibility of nuclear war. I don't believe that Mondale was really dumb enough to believe his own statements. I think he only did this out of desperation. He had to think of something, so he decided to play politics and use the possibility of nuclear war to scare the public. It didn't work (Mondale lost the election by a huge margin), but you can't blame him for trying. In the same situation, most any politician would have done the same thing. It doesn't necessarily mean that he believed what his own words.<br />Aside from that, Charen is an excellent writer, and she breaks down statements piece by piece, then uses actual lessons from history to show how the liberal speaker was way off base when he/she made the remark. She is effective, yes, but she fails to point out the motives behind the statements and some of her quotes could very well be taken out of context.<br />This is one of those books that will be cherished by some, and despised by others. If you worship such political figures as Ronald Reagan, Pat Buchanan, and Bob Dole, then you will undoubtedly enjoy \\"Useful Idiots\\". But if your political preferences lean more toward Ted Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, and Bill Clinton, then you should probably avoid \\"Useful Idiots\\" completely.

He feels that we need to be aware of the everyday dangers to our personal privacy, and that we should not take this issue lightly.<br />Hyatt begins the book by discussing the supposed &quot;threat&quot; that exists today, from corporations, individuals, and the government. According to Hyatt, there are threats to your privacy that are all around you, and some are not so obvious to the naked eye. Most of us are aware of some of the threats, like government surveillance and Social Security number theft. But other privacy threats are not quite so obvious, like the threat imposed by using supermarket credit cards. Through the use of these cards, the store is able to keep tabs on all sorts of personal data, which is often more information than many people would want them to have.<br />In the second and third parts of the book, Hyatt talks about specific strategies to use, to minimize the problems that are caused by invasions of privacy. He recommends, for instance, using a P.O. Box, whenever practical, instead of your home address, to avoid letting others know exactly where you live. He also recommends not carrying your Social Security Card in your wallet, and getting your Social Security number removed from your driver's license and other forms of ID, to reduce the chances of identity theft.<br />Hyatt wraps of the book with several appendices that are meant to assist the individual in assessing his/her privacy knowledge and risk. There's a privacy self assessment test; a privacy checklist; privacy resource list; family privacy policy; and a public servant questionnaire.<br />Hyatt seems a little obsessed with his concerns about privacy, and many readers might think he borders on being paranoid. Are we really in this much danger, to justify taking all these measures to protect our privacy? Personally, I think Hyatt goes a bit overboard on a few occassions (like when he recommends not using cordless phones, because someone could be listening in) but I must admit that I did take his advice by removing my Social Security Card from my wallet. I don't carry it with me anymore.<br />Overall, this is a pretty good book. It's a quick read, and it does give some sound advice on how to protect yourself in the information age. I wouldn't necessarily take everything Hyatt recommends to heart, but I think that some of his recommendations are worth listening to. It's better to be safe, than sorry.oes a bit overboard on a few occassions (like when he recommends not using cordless phones, because someone could be listening in) but I must admit that I did take his advice by removing my Social Security Card from my wallet.

Is the planet earth headed for disaster? Are we depleting the ozone level too quickly? Are chemicals and pesticides going to kill us all? What about acid rain and nuclear power? Environmentalists claim that greenhouse gases are going to warm the earth so much that the polar ice caps will melt and there will be coastal flooding and mass hysteria. But is all of this really true? Is there really an environmental crisis that mankind has caused, or is this all just another fallicy created by environmental extremists and power- hungry politicians in order to scare the public and push their respective agendas on the people?<br />According to the authors, Ben Bolch and Harold Lyons, the entire environmental movement is, for the most part, a poliical hoax! With global warming, for instance, the public has been scared into believing that the earth is going to get so warm that the ocean levels will rise and cities like Miami and New York will be submerged under water. The authors don't deny that the actual surface temperature of the earth has increased over the past 50 years. Scientific studies do, indeed, show that it has increased. What the authors argue is that the slight warming of the earth is natural and has occurred many times in the past, when the earth has gone through periods of cooling and warming. The contribution of mankind, to the warming process, is too miniscule to make any significant difference and we don't really have enough weather records, from far enough back, to draw any definite conclusions.<br />The authors show some examples of how chemical phobia has been touted by environmentalists as a serious threat and that all Americans &quot;live in peril&quot;. Alar is one such chemical and so is dioxin. Then, there's the continuous scare over asbestos. Corporations are usually blamed for all of these problems. No one ever bothers to point out how chemicals have helped mankind over the years. Why corporations and economic activity are always made to take the blame, I'm not sure. I assume it's because corporations have money, and are therefore a good target to go after, by both environmentalists and their political allies in Washington. The type of politician who engages in this type of game is always the type who wants more regulation, and more taxes. Chemical phobia provides a means to scare people into submission, making ordinary Americans think that more government control is necessary to save their lives.<br />There are other issues, too, that the authors mention, to make their point. Remember the radon gas scare a few years ago? People across the nation were worried that they were going to die in their sleep from radioactive gas poisoning. Overzealous government officials seized the opportunity to call for more regulations of individuals and businesses, and expand government control and power. They did the same thing with other concerns, too, like acid rain and ozone depletion.<br />&quot;Apocalypse Not&quot; is a 140 page paperback book that's quick and easy to read. It will help to dispell the myths of the global warming scare, chemical phobia, nuclear power, and other concerns. You will sleep better at night once you realize that the earth is not going to be destroyed by toxic gases, acid rain, ozone depletion, or any other of the usual environmental concerns.lame, I'm not sure.

This book was composed and edited in 1986, by David Boaz, one of the leaders of the Cato Institute, a Libertarian Think- Tank in Washington, D.C. There are a total of 15 different essays in this 122 page paperback book, and each one is written by a different author.<br />The basic premise of this book is that the American Political landscape is going to change in the coming years, as the baby boom generation matures. Baby boomers are known for their tendency to be economically conservative (more Republican) and socially liberal (more Democratic). This combination of traits will move politics in a Libertarian direction, in the coming years. Today, the nations politics are more conservative overall. That's mainly due to the fact that there are so many older voters (pre- baby boom generation)who tend to be conservative on most all issues, economic and social.<br />Some of the ideas presented here are interesting. The writers point out that, prior to the 1970's, political analysts tried to peg everyone as being either liberal, moderate, or conservative. Someone who was conservative on economic issues (against government control of the economy) and liberal on social issues (against government control on personal decisions) was considered to be &quot;inconsistent&quot; in his/her thinking. Likewise, someone who was liberal on economic issues and conservative on social issues was also viewed as inconsistent. If anything, what's really inconsistent is to be conservative on ALL issues, or liberal on ALL issues. In other words, in the past, if you were 100% pro- liberty, or 100% pro- government, you were labeled as unusual in your thinking. Times have changed!<br />The various contributors of this book agree that politicians has better pay attention to the coming changes in the political landscape. If they ignore these changes, they will likely be replaced by more Libertarian- thinking leaders.aced by more Libertarian- thinking leaders.	2001-08-04

Should we place limits on the amount of time politicians can serve in public office? This is a question with no definitive answer. In this book, &quot;The Politics and Law of Term Limits&quot;, eleven different authors offer their perspective on the issue.<br />The arguments against having term limits usually center on the ideal of free and absolute choice. If the people want a certain politician to remain in office for a long period of time, then they should be permitted to vote for that person for as long as he/she is willing to run for office. The other argument that's often presented is that long- term politicians are better because they have years and years of experience. Therefore, we should WANT to keep them in office, because it's better to be governed by a pro than a rookie. And, if the people decide that they no longer like the person in office, then they can show their disapproval by voting him/her out, on the next election day.<br />Proponents of term limits state their case by pointing out, first of all, that the majority of Americans want term limits, and that we should honor the will of the people by enacting limits whenever possible. The people in this camp also emphasize that term limits are often needed to prevent tyranny and corruption. In countries where there is no limits on time served in office, elections are often rigged so that the incumbent can remain in power. Term limits would also put a halt to the phenomenon known as the &quot;career politician&quot; that we are now experiencing in politics. In the early part of American history, it was traditional to serve for only a few years in office, and then step down and move on to other things. Today, we have career politicians like Ted Kennedy and Strom Thurmond (and many, many others!) who are permanent fixtures in Washington and will likely remain there, no matter what happens.<br />I'm undecided on the issue of term limits, but I'm leaning toward the pro- term limit camp. On one hand, I think people should be allowed to vote for whomever they choose. But, I can also see the problems that career politicians have caused and I don't see any other solution, other than term limits, to remove these people from office. I don't accept the argument that we should keep them because they are more experienced. As everyone knows, experienced politicians are usually the most dangerous of all because they have learned, through the years, how to manipulate and lie effectively to the people. Also, they are usually so set in their ways that they will not likely ever change, even if change is for the better. Yes, voters could remove them from office by simply casting a vote for someone else. But this usually doesn't happen. These career politicians are often entrenched in their respective offices. And the majority of people will just continue to vote for them, not because they agree with their stand on the issues, but because they are so familiar with their names and because most voters are apathetic and uninformed. We tend to just vote for the person whose name we most recognize, or the one who has the party label that we like best. It doesn't seem to matter how incompetent the politician might be. We still tend to vote for incumbants. Having term limits would help solve this problem by providing the people with fresh ideas and new ways to solve problems.<br />This book lists for the price of $19.95, which I think is a little steep for a 160 page book. It does present some good discussions, from both sides of the coin, so I recommend reading it, if you have the chance. It will make you think about the issue of term limits in ways that you haven't thought about before.k people should be allowed to vote for whomever they choose.

This book details the beer recipes that have been selected as the best in their respective classes. The author compiled these recipes by  selecting only first, second, and third place winners from the hundreds of  homebrewing contests that have been held across the country.<br /> I have been  involved in hombrewing for about five years now. It is an interesting, but  unpredictable hobby. No matter what you do, no matter how careful you are,  no matter how precise you try to be, you still do not really know what your  homemade beer will taste like until the batch is completely aged and ready  to drink.<br /> Homebrewers typically rely on books to help them in their  quest for new and interesting beer recipes. This text assembles the award-  winning recipes into one book, organized by style of beer, with a short  description of each style at the beginning of each section.<br /> The recipes  present a well- detailed listing of the ingredients, but there are some  inconsistencies among them. For one thing, some of the recipes do not  include a list of instructions for making the beer. I don't know if this is  because they were simply overlooked by the author, or because the owner of  the recipe didn't want anyone to know the process. Whatever the reason, it  does cause a little frustration for the reader. You could stumble across a  really good recipe, but you won't know exactly how to prepare it. You could  give it your best shot, but as mentioned before, homebrewing is a very  delicate craft that can result in unwanted results if the original recipe  is not followed with precision.<br /> This book will provide you with a pretty  good reference tool for preparing your next batch of homemade brew. There  isn't much here, as far as reading material goes. The primary focus is on  the recipes. Browse through the entire book before you make your decision  on what to make. You will then be on your way to a delicious batch of  homemade malt beverage. Cheers!r way to a delicious batch of  homemade malt beverage. Cheers!	2000-03-30

The authors simply state the facts. When they do not have all the facts, they make mention of it. They do not try to directly persuade the reader, they let the facts speak for themselves. They show how Clinton has betrayed the American people on numerous occasions, from his early days as a young Arkansas politician, all the way to the 1996 election and beyond.<br />Why hasn't this incident received the coverage from the media that it rightfully deserves? Why haven't more individuals been brought to justice? While it is true that nearly all potential witnesses have either died, fled the country, or pleaded the 5th, I still feel that much more effort should be made to prosecute and punish the guilty parties.<br /> Americans have become immune to the dishonesty of politicians. Manipulation and deceit have become so commonplace that people just don't seem to care anymore. The popular view is that it is ok to tell a lie as long as you are not caught. If the means justify the ends, then telling a lie is ok. I am not a fan of William Bennett, but maybe he does have a good point when he describes the present- day situation as &quot;the death of outrage&quot;.<br /> Mr. Clinton now rivals Richard Nixon as the most dishonest man to ever occupy the White House. The only difference between the two is that Nixon was caught. Clinton has not been formally accused and brought to trial for his treasonous conduct, but that doesn't make his crimes any less serious.<br /> Chinagate is a serious matter that deserves more attention that it has received. Forget the Monica Lewinsky debacle.  This is the scandal that really matters.	1999-11-28

Where I work, this simple  policy is ignored. My company fails from the start by promoting employees  to managerial positions based on personal friendships, political motives,  and the understanding that the new manager will adhere to the rules. I'm  sorry to say it, but I have witnessed several instances in my place of  employment where an individual who was talented, but independant in his/her  thinking, was refused promotion to management because it was feared that  he/she was the type who would break the rules.<br /> After the newly hired  manager takes over, there are inevitable problems. My company tries to  train the new manager to perform his/her role effectively, but there isn't  much improvement because the individual was miscast from the beginning. The  talent to manage was never there. And, because the manager is incompetent,  he/she is likely to hire employees who are also incompetent. These  employees eventually become inept, but loyal, managers in the future. The  chain remains unbroken.<br /> This book also speaks out about the importance  of rewarding positive behavior. I can recall several occasions where  rewards have been given to weak performers. I have been highly critical of  this practice, but it still continues. The reason for rewarding bad  behavior, I'm told, is to motivate below average employees. This is  counter-productive for two important reasons: First, it encourages the weak  performer to remain weak; second, it frustrates and discourages the  excellent employees. Why should a highly motivated employee waste his or  her time if a weak employee gets the recognition?<br /> Conventional wisdom,  and the ineffective management that it breeds, are going to take a good  amount of time to change. My company is notorious for resisting change,  promoting based on political reasons, and then refusing to remove inept  managers from their positions. These &quot;inner circles&quot;, &quot;buddy  systems&quot;, etc, are commonplace throughout corporate America. My  company is not the only one with these problems. The majority of companies  have the same problems.<br /> I think the time has come for management to drop  these conservative ideas and pave the way for a new, aggressive approach to  management. The results of great management are too obvious to ignore any  longer.and the ineffective management that it breeds, are going to take a good  amount of time to change.

You will discover that  government abuses run far and wide, from police harassment, to IRS  intimidation, to government censorship of television and radio.<br /> These  abuses are far worse than many people realize. The American public has  become too apathetic, too vulnerable to political rambling, and too  accepting of abusive, coercive government rules and regulations.<br /> James  Bovard provides an excellent account of these government abuses.

Give a politician the  authority to pass one oppressive law and, eventually, more and more  oppressive laws will follow. Government has become increasingly intrusive,  unethical, and dishonest over the years as more and more special interest  legislation has made its way through congress.<br /> This process did not take  place overnight and it will not be eliminated overnight. Americans must  work for change first on the local level, leading up to the state and  national levels. We must act quickly before it is too late. I hope that  many people will read this book and take action. A totalitarian United  States government is closer than we think.	1999-08-21

What appeared to be just another boring election day, with the victories across the country going to the candidate perceived as the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot;, suddenly took an exciting  turn: Jesse Ventura had just won the election and was the new governor of  the state of Minnesota.<br /> Ventura is a man of high integrity, discipline,  and determination. He does not hold back when it comes to a challenge, or  when it comes to telling the truth. And he does tell the truth in this  book. He openly admits things that a typical politician would deny all the  way to grave. Jesse has a very colorful history and, while some may feel  that his past includes many acts of questionable morality, there is no  denying that he is a man of his word, a man of courage and integrity.<br /> An  important message has been sent to the two old, washed- up parties. A third  party candidate can easily outperform his opponents in an open debate  (Ventura did more than merely outperform Coleman and Humphery- he  demolished them) and the voters will take notice. The people have shown  that their votes are not for sale, either. Ventura's two opponents spent,  combined, more than twenty times as much money as he did on the campaign  for governor. Twenty times!! But ventura still beat them.<br /> Americans are  slow to change. What happened in Minnesota should serve as an inspiration  to the rest of the nation. We need to change our boring, ineffective  political system. There is too much corruption, lying, deception, wasteful  spending, and overall lack of integrity in both the Republican and  Democratic parties. I salute the people of Minnesota for taking the lead in  breaking up the two party monopoly.	1999-08-01

But, in the end, the  entire book makes more sense than many people will want to admit.<br /> Boortz  attacks the liberal thought process head-on. He shows how the liberal  thinks with emotions rather than sound logic, how the liberal often cannot  defend his positions, and how liberals will resort to deception, if  necessary, to promote their agenda.<br /> This book is a quick, easy read that  will thrill conservatives while driving our left- leaning friends crazy  with its blunt honesty. As you read this book, don't be surprised if you  find yourself continuously nodding your head in agreement.<br /> And don't  forget: VOTE LIBERTARIAN!	1999-07-31

Beer is no longer the boring, &quot;they all taste the  same&quot; beverage that it was in the United States for so long. Thanks to  the microbrewing revolution, beer is now the equivalent of wine in respect  to its diversity and its adaptability to many occasions.<br /> The best part  of this book is the illustrations. Each beer is presented in a section with  similar beer styles, complete with a picture of the bottle and a picture of  a glass filled with that particular brand of beer. There is also a  food/occasion section with more pictures of beer along with the food that  it best accomodates.<br /> This book provides a good reference to the many  styles of beer, the brewing process, and the compatibility of beer to any  taste or occasion. Take notice: after you read this book and look at those  full glasses of beer, you will have an uncontrollable urge to head to the  nearest beverage store!	1999-06-26

Plain and simple, this is the principle that we all should live  by.<br /> As ridiculous as the laws against consensual crimes are, there are  still a large number of people who support them. I think this is because  they have either not really thought about the subject of consensual crimes  or they have misconceptions about what would happen if the laws were  dropped. For instance, if you proclaim that drug laws are ineffective and  should be repealed, the initial reaction from others is that drug use would  become widespread and out of control. This would not happen because, with  drugs being legal, there would no longer be an underground market and,  therefore, no money to be made by selling drugs. They would become just  which are legal right now that anyone can puchase from the drugstore and  get a good buzz. But no one does this!<br /> I think we will see a gradual  decrease in consensual crime laws. Education is the key to bringing about  this change. As the insanity of consensual crime laws become more and more  obvious to the public, free choice will slowly become the norm.<br /> If you  have already read this book, make sure that you give it to a friend or  relative to read. It is over 650 pages, but easy to read. This is an  excellent resource that effectively debunks the myths surrounding  consensual crime laws. It will open the eyes of non-believers.	1999-04-20

Author Daniel Jonah Goldhagen presents a very intellectual discussion about the involvement of the common folk in the slaughtering of the Jewish  people in Nazi Germany. He does score some solid hits in his arguments, but  he also leaves much unanswered and open to debate.<br /> I do not have any  doubts that ordinary Germans were, by and large, supportive of the Nazi  plan to solve the Jewish problem through extermination. I think that the  German people had been conditioned for many, many years to believe that the  Jewish people were subhuman and not worthy to live. Therefore, they had no  problem accepting the plan to destroy the Jewish race. This widely held,  widely accepted feeling of anti-semitism was the greatest contributing  factor in the embracement of the German government's policy toward the  Jews, by ordinary Germans, during this era. The next most important factor  is psychological. Studies on prejudice have shown that humans enjoy feeling  superior to others and delight in keeping &quot;inferiors&quot; in their  place. Once the feelings of superiority subside, however, an individual  will often feel guilty. I think the same thing happened in Nazi Germany.  There was an atmosphere of superiority. Germans enjoyed harassing, hurting,  even torturing Jews. Then, the Nazi regime came to an end. These same  Germans, who once delighted in their actions against the Jewish people,  probably looked back and wondered &quot;What was I thinking? Why did I  commit such terrible acts of violence against a defenseless group of  people&quot;? I do not think it is fair to just assume that the Germans,  during this time in history, were inherently evil beings as the author  tries to argue.<br /> Much of this book is monotonous and a little boring. I  don't know how many times I read a statement that spoke of &quot;the  horrenhous treatment of Jews&quot;. I guess the author felt so strongly  about his convictions that some things could not be repeated often enough.	1999-04-06

Harry Browne  stresses, again and again, throughout the book, that each person is unique  and has sole authority over their own lives and the resulting happiness or  unhappiness that comes from personal decisions.<br /> While reading this book,  I felt like I was reading my own exact words. Browne's ideas are perfectly  parallel with my own philosophy regarding individual choice and personal  responsibility- a philosophy that I have believed in since my early  childhood. I did not learn this way of thinking from my parents or anyone  else. I adopted it myself simply because it makes sense. I have never  really believed any other way. I think that everyone should be free to do  whatever he/she chooses as long as it does not interfere with the equal  right of others to do whatever they choose. This has always been the  principle that I have lived by.<br /> The &quot;traps&quot; that the text  refers to are very common to everyone. We have all fallen into one or more  of these traps at one time or another. I feel fortunate to have avoided  most of these traps throughout my life. I have fallen victim to some, but I  have managed to escape. There are still a few traps that I am stuck in, but  there is always hope that, with enough determination, I will successfully  exit the trap.<br /> Is all of this too selfish? I don't think so, not when  you consider the alternatives. Would life be worth living if it meant  sacrificing your own happiness for the benefit of others? Some might argue  that compromise is essential in all relationships, but why not just choose  to associate with only those individuals that are compatible with you and  accept you as you are, thereby eliminating the need for liberty-  restrictive compromise?<br /> There are many obstacles on the road to personal  freedom and happiness, but none are insurmountable. Where there's a will,  there's a way. I think we are, as a society, on the verge of an  overwhelming realization that our liberty has eroded too far. We want it  back!ll,  there's a way. I think we are, as a society, on the verge of an  overwhelming realization that our liberty has eroded too far. We want it  back!	1998-11-25

He also takes a few shots at writing short  stories<br /> The first part of the book deals primarily with humor and some  of Carey's personal views on life. I felt that this was the best part of  the book, full of great jokes and blunt, but fair criticism of politics,  hollywood living, and other aspects of life in general. There was little  coverage given to Carey's personal life history. I would have liked it if  he had said a little more on this subject. Drew included a section of  pictures that will surprise the reader. You won't believe that some of  these pictures are really Drew Carey.<br /> At the end of the book is a  section of short stories that Drew Carey wrote himself. These &quot;stories  of the unrefined&quot; are ok, but I would have preferred to read more  humor.	1998-08-23

An important book for all to read, it explains the deceptive tactics used by this group to shove their political agenda on America and the rest of the world.<br /> Mr. Robertson has one clear goal for America: a theocratic, oppressive regime. Anyone who disagrees with his views is labeled in a variety of ways, including communist, liberal, anti- god, anti- family, etc. His followers take extreme, hateful positions against women's rights advocates, affirmative action, and public education.<br /> It is shocking to think that there are so many people out there who support these views. There are some followers of the Christian Coalition who clearly understand their positions on the issues and support them anyway. I think this represents a very small percentage. The majority of the groups follower! s do not really understand what is going on here. They have not heard the reversals on issues, the hypocrisy, the outright lies that are told by Pat Robertson. They assume that a so called &quot;man of God&quot; cannot do wrong. These blind loyalists could be converted against Robertson if only they would seek out the truth. Robertson's record of deception speaks for itself.<br /> Pat Robertsons MUST be stopped now! We can no longer sit back and remain apathetic and naive. This group represents a very real, very dangerous threat to personal liberty and the American Way.<br /> What I would like to personally say to Mr. Robertson is this: the next time you are having thoughts about accusations of satanism, devil worship, and unholiness, stop and come to your senses. The real antichrist is the man in the mirror!	1998-07-27

He uncovers some interesting and surprising facts from time to time and he provides the reader with more than enough statistics for one book.<br /> The main focus of &quot;Money&quot; is the economic trends of the past twenty to thirty years. Hacker points out some of the important changes that have taken place and he is careful to emphasize that while these trends are a step in the right direction, there is still much room for improvement. Examples would include the overall increase in pay for women, the movement of women into non-traditional, higher paying jobs, and the upward mobility of blacks into higher social classes.<br /> There are several other areas where the economic trends have not been necessarily favorable. The most obvious is the growing income inequality between rich and poor. While this is usually viewed in a negative light by most people, Hacker does not say much about the possible consequences relating to the income inequality gap or what can be done to stop this trend. He merely states that these financial inequalities are a fact of life, a direct result of the capitalistic system.<br /> With subjects as diverse as economic trends, causes, predictions, etc., this book could have easily been double, perhaps triple, in length. Hacker provides a quick overview with lots of economic statistics in a relatively short amount of space.	1998-07-21

Kennedy. No stone is left unturned as the author exhaustively sorts through the details of this important historical event.<br />  It is hard to believe that some people still naively think that Oswald acted alone in committing this crime. The supporter's of the Warren Commission's final decision are often stubbornly loyal to the lone gunman theory. But one has to wonder about the motives of these individuals. For example, are the members of the American Medical Association who agree with the Warren Commission really that naive and ignorant, or are they involved in a cover up? Many WC loyalists are well - educated, intelligent people. So, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that some of these people (those in government, the AMA, etc) must surely be involved in a cover up. Fetzer's decision to resign from the AMA, given all of the dishonesty and secrecy attributed to this group of so- called professionals, was admirable.<br />  One omission from this book that surprised me is the role of Jack Ruby, Oswald's assassin. Fetzer focuses his efforts on the conspiracy theory and the possibility of the involvement of more than one assassin. I agree that this is the most important part of the case, but what about Jack Ruby? I think his involvement in the conspiracy deserves some mention.<br />  This book provides conclusive evidence that there was a conspiracy. There are simply too many unanswered questions, too many odd occurances, and too much suspicious behavior to think otherwise. I am convinced!	1998-07-12

Author Joseph Ellis tries his best to accurately portray Jefferson without getting too technical and contradictory. This is not an easy task, given the person that this book focuses on. Jefferson was a complex idealist and he believed in the ideals of self government without federal interference to an uncompromising degree.<br /> I was surprised that Ellis did not give any coverage to the Adams- Jefferson feud in the election of 1800. There are many pages in this book that cover the reconciliation between the two men that followed Jefferson's retirement from public service. But little, if any, is said about the political showdown leading up to the election of 1800. Also, the author tries to solve the Sally Hemings controversy once and for all. Ellis states that he doesn't think there was any sexual relationship (I think there was) although he admits that there is no conclusive proof, one way or the other.<br /> This biography does a good job explaining the true meaning behind Jefferson's political philosophy. For example, despite what some extremists in the religious community have tried to say, Jefferson was ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY, 100% against church- state relations! He did not even allow theology to be taught at the school he founded, the University of Virginia. He felt that a nation based on personal liberty was the ideal utopian state that the new republic should guarantee to all citizens.<br /> I am often disgusted when I see our two major political parties, Republican and Democratic (especially Democrats) try to claim Jefferson as one of their own. Thomas Jefferson would be sickened by both of them if he were alive today! His ideas of personal liberty and free choice would place him in the Libertarian sector, if he could even be placed at all.<br /> Thomas Jefferson is, and will always be, an American icon.

This book tries to provide a quick summary of the important periods in Darwin's life, touching briefly on each significant aspect.<br /> Much of the book is written in a somewhat technical way and is a bit too wordy. I had a difficult time maintaining my interest while I was reading some of the chapters. Certain areas deserved more coverage, like the reaction when Darwin went public with his theories.<br /> On the positive side, this book does give some good insight on Darwin's relationships with the other prominent scientists of his time and there are some moments where the slowness of the book becomes more interesting, like the section that covers Darwin's voyage of discovery aboard the Beagle. Overall, however, Bowler does not really present anything new or profound that we haven't heard before.	1998-05-15

How can a president manage to survive all of the negative press with his reputation intact. Who can a president call on in those critical times of crisis?<br /> Introducing: The Clinton Propaganda Machine<br /> All American presidents in the modern era have had a special group of political advisors to assist the president in his dealings with the media. This is nothing new. But the Clinton spin team has had more than just an ordinary amount of work on their hands. This has been a full scale workout from the very first days of Clinton's initial term as president, to the present day, with little time for rest. Just when it appears that the spinmeisters can have some time to catch their breath, another juicy tidbit of political misbehavior reaches the public, setting the spin cycle into motion once again.<br /><br />Clinton has never had a good relationship with the media as a whole. In the past, the press was a little more sympathetic to presidential blunders. Today, they are relentless in their pursuit of any newsworthy information; pushing, pulling, twisting, and choking their victims of any last morsel of dignity. Who is the real villian here? Is it the president for committing unethical acts, or is it the media for submitting to ruthless, tabloid- like tactics? This book leaves you wondering. Maybe the real blame should be placed on the public. After all, if the people did not purchase the newspapers and watch the new stories, they would eventually cease. We like to blame the press for circulating dirty laundry. But aren't we, the people, equally to blame if we buy these magazines and newspapers and watch these television programs?<br /><br />Whether you like politics or not, you will enjoy &quot;Spin Cycle&quot;.

Jon Krakauer, along with the other members of the expedition, experiences every emotion in the spectrum as he makes his ascension and descension of the world's highest mountain. Krakauer was met with undeserved criticism when he arrived back in the U.S., and he says that the event still haunts him today. He needs to put the event into perspective. He should not have any regrets over what happened. It is easy for someone who has never been in this situation to criticize. But, given the circumstances, there is little that he could have done to save the lives of his fellow climbers, like Andy Harris. I doubt that any one of us (myself included) could have done any more.<br /> Although this book ends on a tragic note, I still feel compelled to give mountain climbing a try after reading it. Maybe not Mount Everest, but perhaps some other mountains, just to experience the thrill of the accomplishment.<br /><br />All that I can think of right now is the frightening image of those climbers, stuck in the freezing, bitter cold, watching their limbs turn blue. With the snow falling outside right now, I feel a greater sense of appreciation for the warmth inside my house.	1998-03-24

What I thought would be an inspiring &quot;rags to riches&quot; success story turns out instead to be a biography of a guy with little direction who had a love for cars and boats. Richard's father, Grant Sr., appears to be the real inspiration in the family. It would be interesting to read a book about his life and his ascension to success and fame.<br /> Grant readily admits that his last name helped him.

He traces church- state relations from several hundred years ago to the present day and confronts the non-seperationists with zeal and passion.<br />  Why do many Americans fall so easily for the propaganda and historical distortions from the Religious Right? I think the main reason lies in the attitudes that many Americans have toward people in authority. Not just religious authority, but other authorities as well, such as political figures, teachers, and even our elders. Many people seem to falsely think that individuals in positions of authority are incapable of wrongdoing, even when they have been proven wrong in the past. I cannot count the number of times that I have heard a person in an authoritarian position make an outrageous statement which is then quickly taken as gospel by the gullible public. Sometimes, the individual in authority will later contradict himself and even his contradiction will be treated as infallible by the public! This has never ceased to amaze me.<br /><br />  Rob Boston states several times that he is unsure whether the Religious Right is ignorant of the facts or withholding the truth. In the case of the followers of the movement, I think ignorance and vulnerability are at the forefront. But the leaders of this so- called &quot;religious&quot; movement can only be described one way: they are bona-fide liars! Pat Robertson and the rest of the leaders are willing to sacrifice honesty in order to further their political agenda. These leaders have studied the constitution and American history history extensively. They would have to know that what they preach is completely false, beyond all shadow of a doubt.<br /><br />  We all need to take a stand against these extremist groups to protect our freedom for ourselves and for future generations. Remember: apathy is the #1 tool used by the Religious Right. We need to get up and fight!and fight!	1998-01-20

Just when you think that you know what will happen next, a shocking discovery or unexpected event changes everything.  I believe that W.R. Grace and Beatrice were ultimately responsible for the chemical dumpings and the resulting water contamination. Schlictmann handled the case fairly well, except perhaps for his closing arguments. If the plaintiffs wanted tenacity, however, they could not have found a better representative than Jan Schlictmann. His persistence and obsession to seek justice for his clients was admirable, but it came with a price. When an individual is willing to take risks this great, like Schlictmann did, he/she cannot expect to win every time or for everything to go smoothly.  As for as the defense is concerned, I think they did what all defense attorneys do: get their client a not guilty verdict, even when they know in their heart that the defendant is guilty. There were definitely some ego problems here. Both Facher and Cheeseman seemed annoyed that this younger lawyer, Jan Schlictmann, upstaged and outsmarted them on more than one occasion. Author Johnathon Harr does not give much coverage behind the scenes with the defense, so one cannot say with certainty what they were thinking about. But, given the evidence, it would be hard for anyone to think that these two corporations were not in some way responsible for the contaminations.<br />  If there is one individual deserving of blame in this case, it has to be Judge Skinner. Here we have an egotistical, worthless, stubborn old man, masquerading as an impartial seeker of justice and truth. A man incapable of admitting that he could make a mistake. A man with an attitude: &quot;I am the judge, the infallible god of law. I will decide how I want this case to be decided&quot;. How could Skinner not know that Grace and Beatrice were responsible for these deaths? Why did Skinner pose his unreasonable set of questions to the jurors? Why did he seem partial to the defense? When I was reading this book, I started to get resentful at the fact that Schlictmann was still referring to Skinner in a respectful way by saying &quot;Your Honor&quot;.

He stresses the importance of such issues as global warming and the depletion of the ozone and he warns us all of the grave consequences in store for our planet if we do not take quick action. Sagan makes a good scientific debate of abortion and , as always, he is very careful not to offend anyone (although I'm sure that there are extremists on this issue who will be offended anyway). Because &quot;Billions and Billions&quot; is written using articles from magazines and newspapers, it has a somewhat choppy feel. But it is still good reading material. Many may not appreciate Sagan's loyal adherence to the scientific method. But, like it or not, everything that he says makes good sense.

It is written with extreme confidence and persuasive ability. It is easy to see why other Germans were convinced that this plan would succeed. Hitler does not give a single hint of doubt that his plans will not work. He has an answer for everything. Some of his ideas are good, while others are extremely flawed. His argument in favor of racism is absurd. He seems to think that the world is composed of races of individuals that are in competition with each other and that we should all strive to ensure the survival of our race. I agree that we are all competitve to a certain degree. But I think that the competitiveness is on a person to person basis, not race against race.  A common misconception that people have about this book is that it is Satanic. There is not one single mention of Satanism or anything else Satanic in nature anywhere in this book. If anti-semitic thoughts are inherently Satanic, then many of the prominent religious leaders in America are also Satanic. I found it interesting that Hitler never says anything about killing Jews. You get the feeling that he is thinking that way, but he never directly says this.<br />This book is not always easy to read. I often had to read a paragraph a second time in order to fully understand exactly what Hitler was trying to convey to the reader.<br />Mein Kampf should serve as a lesson to all about what can happen when too much power is given to the wrong person.	1997-11-03

This book offers a lengthy guide to homemade beer, complete with reference material about the different styles of beer; how they are made, how strong they typically are, and other basics.<br /><br />Part of the reason Papazian's first book was so much fun was due to its writing style and humor. This, the follow- up, is more technical in nature and not quite as entertaining to read. It sticks mostly to the facts and leaves out much of the fun, making it a little more likely to induce sleep than inspiration. Nevertheless, this book is still useful as a reference tool and it does have some good beer recipes. Cheers!	1997-09-15

I met Charlie Papazian at a local bookstore and he signed my book with his favorite phrase &quot;Relax..Don't Worry..Have a Homebrew&quot;. This book is well organized and is wriiten in an entertaining style. It is the perfect book for the beginner. It details, step-by-step, the basic instructions for brewing your first batch of beer. It also has sperate sections for intermediate and advanced homebrewing. An individual can find an answer to practically any question that he/she might have on the subject of brewing beer somewhere in this book. Among all the the books that I have on the subject of homebrewing, this is the one that I turn to most frequently. Papazian's writing style keeps the subject of brewing interesting from start to finish.	1997-09-13

Carl Sagan does an outstanding job explaining the dangers of pseudoscience. His writing style is both humble and respectful. Although Sagan himself does not beleive in things like aliens, faith healing, astrology, etc., he is sympathetic to those who do. There are no negative words or personal attacks on people. I still find myself reaching for this book from the shelf to provide myself with a source of inspiration. This book can be summarized with the following statement: Be skeptical- If something sounds outrageous, it probably is	1997-09-11

THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS WHEN HE ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS MISTAKE IN HAVING SIMPSON TRY ON THE GLOVE.<br />  ASIDE FROM THIS, THE BOOK IS WRITTEN WITH GREAT SINCERITY AND HONESTY AND IT DOES A GOOD JOB EXPLAINING TO THE READER SOME OF THE HAPPENINGS THAT WENT ON BEHIND THE SCENES THAT FEW WOULD KNOW ABOUT. DARDEN PROBABLY COULD HAVE LEFT OUT MUCH OF THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK WHERE HE DETAILS HIS LIFE STORY. THE BOOK SHOULD HAVE CONCENTRATED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE TRIAL ITSELF	1997-09-10

Simpson Got Away With Murder	Books	5	200	213	N	N	An ex-prosecutor shows his extreme disgust	If there is anybody out there who thinks that O.J. Simpson might possibly be innocent, reading this book will erase any doubt from his/her mind. Bugliosi puts on the boxing gloves and scores a knockout, stating exactly who is to blame and what they did wrong with brutal honesty. When<br />I read this book, I could feel the incredible anger<br />burning from Bugliosi's soul. He is FURIOUS over the fact that a double murderer was allowed to go free, and he does not hesitate to express his feelings on the matter.<br />  Bugliosi does an excellent job explaining why the case was lost and he backs up his opinions with precise examples, basic logic, and good common sense. The only problem that I had with the book is the fact that Bugliosi does tend to get sidetracked (when he debates beleiving in god, for instance) and some of his examples that he uses to back up his opinions are a little too lenghty (we get the picture!). Still, the book is the best one that I have read on the Simpson trial and I highly recommend it	1997-09-10
