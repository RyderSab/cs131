As one of the most curmudgeonly people I know, I was looking forward to a good grousing session with Bernard Goldberg's 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Moreover, to keep in the Oscar-the-Grouch mode, I found myself raising my fist and yelling \\"Yeah!\\" ten or twelve times. \\"Yeah, Jesse Jackson!\\" \\"Edward Kennedy, yeah!\\"<br /><br />The book comes down to a plea for more many-sided, civilized discourse. Who would object? I wish the positive agenda the criticism implies had been more explicitly spelled out, but doing so would have made this a more serious book than it pretends to be.<br /><br />As for Goldberg's choices, some, to my mind, are arguable. Norman Mailer, even when one disagrees with him, is part of what is good about America-provocative, imaginative, daring, fearless. Ingrid Newkirk, on the other hand, has so little influence outside her kooky, half sympathetic enclave that I doubt she's screwing up anyone except herself and a few clothiers. The discussion of Paul Begala seems to me unfocussed and inconclusive. The influence of Michael Moore, number one, is confined to those who believe as he does; his heading the list makes the rest hoist by its own petard.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book falls prey to that which it inveighs against. Given its title, for instance, Goldberg should not object to someone swearing on a cell phone in an airplane, nor should he dismiss Courtney Love (who takes her seriously?) with the single word \\"Ho.\\" To cavil too much, though, is not to read the book at all.<br /><br />There is someone who is screwing up America. However, we elected him and are thus complicit.	2005-09-23

Graysmith could have eliminated repetition, told the story in fewer chapters (the breaks seem arbitrary, and there are too many of them), eliminated supererogatory data about copycat crimes, and finally developed a few insufficiently explored topics: why did murdering lose its allure for Allen? What was the psychological nexus between the Zodiac's fixations on cryptography and science and killing?<br /><br />Perhaps this is to ask for a profundity beyond the author's capabilities. Graysmith exhibits no sense of irony or moral outrage--striking deficiencies in a such a book as this.<br /><br />In his defense and at his own level, however, he does answer some objections other reviewers have raised about apparently conflicting DNA evidence and varying witness identifications. Unlike Patricia Cornwall's explanation of the Jack the Ripper case, Graysmith's solution seems plausible. If the prose is flaccid, at least it is not sensationalized. There should be less of it, though.	2005-08-21

Both were Americans (one native, one transplanted) who loved European culture. Wilson was an early champion of Nabokov's work and wrote, often in Russian to the Russian-born Nabokov until the two men fell out over Nabokov's edition in 1965 of Pushkin's _Eugene Onegin._ These letters trace the arc of their relationship.<br /><br />What struck me was that they often disagreed from the beginning, even as Wilson was arranging for Nabokov to be published by New York book publishers and by _The New Yorker._ Their arguments on prosody are reiterated time and again for decades. How could they stand it? Then a seven year gap occurred, after their dispute of _Onegin._ They never really patched it up-probably couldn't.<br /><br />Through it all, it seems to me that Nabokov gets the better of the arguments. However, perhaps that is the case because his two (in my judgment) world masterpieces, _Lolita_ (1955) and _Pale Fire_ (1958) outdistance anything Wilson ever achieved. Nabokov's was the larger spirit, full of tenderness and wonder, with accents of the magic beyond the Wellfleet scholar, for all of his thoroughness and studiousness. How ironic that Nabokov should have been the academic, teaching for years at Wellesley and Cornell.<br /><br />The special Nabokov touches are not in sufficient display in these letters. Partly it's that much of the correspondence is about business matters, and partly it's that Wilson, astonishingly for all he did for Nabokov, may not have been the right audience. About _Pale Fire_ Wilson says not a word. _Lolita_ he \\"like[s] . . . less than anything of yours I have read.\\" How much of this was professional jealousy-Wilson was the author of fiction as well as reportage and criticism-it is impossible to say. One wonders what Wilson's wife Elena made of Nabokov's other fiction, since she clearly saw the merits of Lolita. Would there were more substantive letters from her.<br /><br />All in all this is a limited, very sad book. Much cheerier to go back to Wilson's analyses of writing and writers, which, as Menand says, illuminate \\"as though a thousand watt bulb\\" were shone upon the work. Or to reread _Pnin, Laughter in the Dark, Speak, Memory,_ or the other enchantments that Nabokov could pull off.hat Wilson's wife Elena made of Nabokov's other fiction, since she clearly saw the merits of Lolita.

The book can have an intermittently disconcerting fascination, and it is agreeably off putting, with first person pronouns divided up (\\"m/e\\" [and in the French version \\"j/e\\"]), presumeably to break down language false to the lesbian self and the experience of love the book wishes to embody. Moreover, the attraction of the narrator for her inamorata is not confined to anything like usual romantic palaver; it can derive from, say, sweat. It is often expressed in violence. \\"Under m/y frantic pressure your head becomes detached at the level of the cervical vertebrae.\\" I guess this is love, if between consenting adults.<br /><br />I don't find the new language _more_ satisfactory or illuminating; it is just different, for the sake being so, nor for me does feminizing the characters in the _Iliad,_ as _The Lesbian Body_ does, add to an understanding of them or make the stories alluded to more moving, entertaining, true, or, given the sketchiness of the references, much unlike what they were in Homer.<br /><br />Interrupting the paeans of love, at apparently arbitrary points, are lists of body parts, often sounding like extracts from a medical textbook. \\"THE DORSALS THE ILIACS THE TERES THE QUADRATI.\\" Is this the inevitability of the phsyical? Or a remaking of love in a way the outside, non-revolutionary world will or must find foreign?<br /><br />The best that can be said about this experiment is that, like the writing of Gertrude Stein, it can shake the reader out of traditional ideas of fiction or writing and bust up stale social notions. By the last page, 165, I had had enough. It was actually more fun to write this review than to read the book.	2005-05-23

Goldhagen's account is centered on events in World War II and does not, therefore, naturally foreground his thesis. Nonetheless, the impressive quantity of material he has amassed and the number of instances in which low level military personnel enthusiastically led Jews to death (and the appallingly few two or three instances in which German citizens did not) wins out. It is impossible to conclude anything other than that Goldhagen is correct.<br /><br />This is not an elegantly written book. Reshaped and reduced by a half, the argument might have had more force. Toward the end, Goldhagen circles around the conundrum of how humans could believe such tripe and act so evilly. This question he does not satisfactorily answer. It may not have a satisfactory answer, because he raises it in such a way that he can only disappoint.<br /><br />What _Hitler's Willing Executioners_ needs is the dramatic strategy of Shakespeare. Behind Othello, the murderer, is Iago, the motivator; however, pressed, Iago can say only \\"Demand me nothing; what you know you know.\\" There is more exploration of the general problem of evil and its wiles in _Othello_ than in this book, although, of course, the sheer number of instances of atrocity is of terrifying scale. Just how overwhelmingly present and how deeply embedded in rank and file Germans the propensity to commit these heinous acts Goldhagen, in his rather dishevelled narrative, does convey.	2005-05-23
US	52600189	RY4U7A9FCGBMR	1931337128	794237112	Reliquaries	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A Marvel	W. H. Auden, who, like Seymour Glass, is never wrong, defined the difference between major and minor poets as ones who do not evolve over the course of their writing lives and those who do. By this criterion, Eric Pankey is a major poet, and by any criterion an extraordinary one as well. His seventh book is less a collection than other books of poetry, including Pankey's previous ones (the distance between _Heartwood,_ a word used once here, and this book is astronomical). _Reliquaries_ is a unified field of connections; links between the unexpected; startling metaphysics; strange ordinariness or ordinary strangeness offered directly, as literal fact. Mystical breakthroughs come at the reader with quiet, inarguable authority, affirming journey, rather than destination.<br /><br />There are three sources for this authority. First is the comforting, no-nonsense objectivity of the language, the poetry's insistence on the physical, the logical, the unemotional.<br /><br />In my idleness I imagine the fly might one day discover a way through the glass,<br /><br />And the miracle will not be the other side, but the liquid simplicity of the passage.<br /><br />  That said, _y_ is not _x,_<br /><br />And perhaps there are other ways to solve for those particular values, perhaps better proofs.<br /><br />The soul, bound as any matter to gravity, moves from room to room,<br /><br />A slowly deflating balloon let go that rides the thermal up, the cold down.<br /><br />If transcendent experiences are to carry the weight of conviction, this is the way they must be presented.<br /><br />The vocabulary of _Reliquaries_ is precise, informed, and new. It makes poetry accommodate \\"karst,\\" \\"narthex,\\" \\"mudra,\\" \\"catenary,\\" \\"kohl,\\" and \\"lectionary.\\" These words, used naturally and necessarily, point to the specificity and wideness of experience in _Reliquaries._<br /><br />The second source of authority is equally poetic. It comes from the long, mostly end-stopped lines that imbue the world of this book with the literalness of prose without sacrificing the dazzling force of art. The sheen is mesmerizing. At 110 pages _Reliquaries_ may be longer than usual, yet this reader finds it as impossible to stop reading as to cut a Beethoven symphony in the middle of a movement. The book compels the reader into its ambience. I have read it thrice, all the way through each time. Edgar Allan Poe wrote that a long poem is but succession of short poems. _Reliquaries_ goes Poe one better. It is both.<br /><br />Finally, the impact derives from a feeling never named that nevertheless comes through in every line: love. Decently awake readers will see the nods to anger and despair, and without such acknowledgments, this would be a work of delusion. Instead, its fidelity to experience carries us beyond what we think we know to what we can know, the marvel of process. \\"I admit to faith, even when I come up empty-handed with only a specter of faith,\\" the voice writes, with brutal courage, having lovingly discarded \\"husks\\" in the first poem as he lovingly discards them in the last.<br /><br />A voyage to and in the other, in a thousand tessellated lines that transport you where you may need to go. _What are you waiting for?_world of this book with the literalness of prose without sacrificing the dazzling force of art.

I did so because Elaine Showalter's on-line notice made me think that, perhaps, interestingly, beneath Mrs. Cheney's political stances lurked a more liberal, variously sympathetic soul. I do not think such is the case. The lesbianism in the story, while positively presented, is forced by circustances so contrived and characters so one dimensional that they undercut any sympathy the author might intend. The presentation of the West is risible.<br /><br />Heterosexual relations in _Sisters_ emanate from shallow cruelty and shallow desire. This combination may be a starting point for analyzing Mrs. Cheney; however, the lack of depth means one can go only so far. For me it is not worth the effort. I had hoped to find a more various and complex second lady, or possibly to be entertained by a skein of unconscious and/or hilarious revelations--but all I felt was boredom.	2005-02-27

Auden marvels that Edgar Allan Poe remained a good critic after having been given subjects so inferior to his abilities. In the case of Ian Penman, one wonders why a man as intelligent and widely read chooses to waste his considerable verbal ingenuity and critical acumen on topics so often unworthy of his talent: Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Bovell (who?), Robin Cook, celebrity biographies. In a shrewd essay on Norman Mailer, Penman writes, characteristically, \\"Sometimes, exhausted, you feel that the world and its malcontents are there only to serve as a metaphor for the Struggle of Being Norman: battered typewriter, liver, lover . . . Mailer.\\" An essay on voyeurism sees Alfred Hitchcock as personifying the \\"stifling wait of the male gaze.\\"<br /><br />Although clever and insightful, Penman's essays exhaust like Mailer. By page 300 they drag one down with or without a Hitch. However, with fewer pieces and more overall design, _Vital Signs_ would spring to life-or at least stir. It probably takes more than Augustus Pablo (who?), Tim Buckley, and Jim Thompson to establish that canon of value without which a critic can only carp emptily, but behind the coruscating wordplay about De Niro, Rik Mayall (who?), Was (who?), Steve Martin, heavy metal bands, and host of performers and would-bes often inferior to the Etonesque Penman, there lies a despairing intelligence that could, one suspects, show the reader a, if not the, way.	2005-02-05

Here's another book touching on the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas 22 November 1963. This one has a different doorway into the room, however. It focuses primarily on the film taken by Abraham Zapruder recording the tragic events. Moreover, unlike the self-published books by others on this topic (more than a dozen by Harold Weisberg, whose persistence one must admire), or the irresponsible, opportunistic, often wrong and wrong-headed books commercially brought out (*Rush to Judgment* by Mark Lane), this one is written by a professor of history and published by a university press.<br />So, then, what does David Wrone do that others don't? *The Zapruder Film* considers issues of ownership and copyright (of that famous amateur movie) and their interaction with the public's right to know. Wrone contends that the government would have served the public interest by seizing this six foot strip of photos and making it generally available. It is a surprising conclusion to a book that spends many of its pages condemning what it sees as a cover-up by governmental agencies-FBI, CIA, Warren Commission. There could have been more arguments and considerations in this section.<br />Wrone's tone is refreshingly dispassionate. He looks at the Zapruder film frame by frame, as others have, but correlates this examination with other photographic evidence, official and unofficial. The book reproduces segments of the Zapruder movie, including the images around the 8 mm. sprocket holes (Zapruder's camera exposed the entire film area) to conclude that Kennedy was hit from the rear, as the Warren Commission decided, and from the front, as it didn't. He concludes from photographic evidence that possibly Oswald never fired at all; Wrone deduces that Oswald was standing in the doorway when the first bullets hit. His evidence that Kennedy was shot from the front seems not unpersuasive, in the way that any reasonably stated argument seems. Finally, the contention, familiar to those who have read other critiques of the Warren Report, that one bullet could not have passed through President Kennedy and shattered bones in Governor John Connolly and remained in pristine condition is brought out again. It is hard not to be convinced. The bullet that purportedly did all the damage looks, in the government's own photograph (Commission exhibit 399), new. At best the government had a good theory but the wrong bullet. At worst, the whole investigation is a fraud.<br />Wrone argues for a conspiracy. We shall never know for certain, yet any book about the assassination that does not solve the case is bound to be partially unsatisfactory. Moreover, logic demands that Wrone consider a possibility that his own evidence points to but that he doesn't raise. It's this: John Kennedy was hated in Dallas. It is not inevitable that because the president was shot from both the front and the rear that the two gunmen were acting together. In other words, whoever else (if there was a second gunman) besides Oswald (if it was Oswald) who fired may have done so independently. When Oswald was arrested, the second killer was in the clear. Since conspiracy implies more than one person has to keep a secret, and it's rare that more than one person can, this explanation has even more plausibility than a cabal.<br />Perhaps this solution sounds suspiciously like that in Agatha Christie's *Murder on the Orient Express* (\\"...guaranteed to knock the keenest mind for a loop. Only a halfwit could guess it.\\"-Raymond Chandler). Such are the contrivances to which one is driven looking at evidence four decades after the fact. Wrone's account has some new twists on the evidence, but its most permanent value is in the legal implications of private ownership of property in which the public has a vital interest. That section of the book, insufficiently argued, is less exciting than the rest-the color photographs overwhelm it-but expanded would have given *The Zapruder Film*more solidity and more permanent interest.more solidity and more permanent interest.	2004-02-15

What better place to search for hitherto unreported aphorisms and bon mots than in the transcripts of his two trials--the one in which he sued the Marquis of Queensbery [my deliberate mispelling, to get back at this man for &quot;somdomite&quot;], Bosie's father, and the one in which he himself was accused of immorality? Since much of the interest in Wilde, as in Fitzgerald and Plath, is in his extraordinary life, this book should be a primary source.<br />If you feel as I do, you will not be disappointed with H., Montgomery Hyde's account. This is not a compilation of dazzling wit, yet wonderful ripostes break out amidst the legal tedium, the inexorable process that led to Wilde's imprisonment. The appendices and Hyde's comments add significantly and are remarkably free of editorializing.<br />A devoted reader of Ellmann's biography will immediately see that Ellmann relied on H. Montgomery Hyde. From a personal acquaintance who in the 1960's met Hyde at Northwestern University, where Ellmann taught, I have learned that the two knew each other well. Ellmann's conclusions about Wilde's syphilis derive in part from Hyde. His precis of the trial is a reduced version of Hyde's full presentation.<br />*The Trails of Oscar Wilde* brings the reader closer to Wilde (as seen by Hyde)--to the man whose force of personality gained him a devoted, usually sympathetic following. The personality is crucial. To Andre Gide, Wilde said, &quot;I have put my talent into my work and my genius into my life [my translation].&quot; Max Beerbohm, among others, claimed that Wilde's conversation was a supreme delight. W. H. Auden judged that except in his masterpiece *The Importance of Being Earnest* Wilde was primarily a performer, not an artist. This book brings the reader closer to that personality, that performer, made all the more moving by the reader's knowing, as the participants could not, what the consequences of his inquisition would be.<br />In honesty I must add that I read this book in a hardcover version published by William Hodge and Company in June 1948. I have not seen the Dover Books edition. Because it has the same title, it is doubtless the same as the one I know. It will be a treasure for the devotee.not, what the consequences of his inquisition would be.<br />In honesty I must add that I read this book in a hardcover version published by William Hodge and Company in June 1948.

Anyone who has wondered what lay behind the appalling decline in only one year from *The Scarlet Letter* (1850) to *The House of the Seven Gables* (1851) will find a persuasive account here. Mitchell is brilliant on *The Blithedale Romance* (1852), admittedly an easy book about which to be brilliant, and more energetic and illuminating on *The Marble Faun* (1860) than other, longer-winded critics. On all these topics and much else (the role of Emerson, sidelong glances at the Hawthorne marriage and Julian Hawthorne's misleading portrayal of it)*Hawthorne's Fuller Mystery* is first rate.<br />I have three gripes. Mitchell's thesis leads him to over-emphasize Emerson's presence behind the portrait of Roger Chillingworth in *The Scarlet Letter* and consequently to downplay the extent to which Hawthorne's identification with the scientific analyst is behind this powerful portrait (to be fair, Mitchell says this, but he makes too little of it). Some of the writing is academic-clotted-e. g., on p. 181: \\"Pike was too good a friend, however, to probe Hawthorne for the origins of his power to penetrate what Pike termed `the deepest, profoundest' or `the inmost of all the emotions' once he had turned away, as Hollingsworth did not, from the love of and for a Sophia-like Phoebe and returned, in a Zenobia, to another Hester.\\" HELP!

First, Sidney Blumenthal's recent *The Clinton Wars* recreates the White House when President Clinton was impeached. Richard Nixon was threatened with impeachment for more serious actions and resigned to avoid it--a neat contrast. Second, Professor William Gaines and his journalism class at the University of Illinois announced in May 2003 that Deep Throat, Bob Woodward's mysterious informant in *All the President's Men,* was John Dean's assistant Fred Fielding. In two tidy pages (136-137), H. R. Haldeman reaches the same conclusion. His brief is necessarily sketchier than that of the Gaines group, but his thinking is similar. On this topic, Haldeman is less sentimental, more objective and more briskly intelligent than Leonard Garment and John Dean, who ride hobby horses.<br />How does the rest of *The Ends of Power* hold up? The prose, probably Joseph DiMona's, is serviceable but slick. Most of the text is an explanation or defense of Watergate. The most insightful idea is Haldeman's linkage of Viet Nam to Watergate; however, as its title indicates, the book does not pretend to be a full account of Nixon's presidency. As Haldeman presents them, the facts are not apparently self-serving. They may thus be more subtly self-exculpatory.<br />Haldeman exhibits little moral feeling. There is no sense here of the country's having been done a great wrong or of the fact that Nixon's abilities--which the text names--were wasted by this ethical void. Watergate was surely a more consequential breach of behavior than oval office trysts, though the anguished evasions of Nixon and Clinton may appear eerily alike.<br />On the positive side, one feels that Haldeman succeeds, with a compression equal to his argument about the identity of Deep Throat, in making Nixon humanly understandable, even likeable. Longer and more balanced accounts of Nixon's administration do this task less effectively, and at greater length.<br />There is no index in *The Ends of Power.* That is outrageous and unforgivable!in *The Ends of Power.* That is outrageous and unforgivable!	2003-06-22

Its strengths are its fidelity to the events of O'Connor's largely unexciting life as a practicing writer and Catholic and, in this age of the doorstop biography, its modest length. Cash mines *The Habit of Being,* Sally Fitzgerald's 1979 collection of letters, and the archives she dutifully has read through. O'Connor's brilliance, orneriness, intractibility, deadpan humor, courage, honor, talent (at least by repute), and doggedness come through. In some ways, that's enough--four stars. However, one who finishes this book may still want more.<br />What is missing? An extended understanding of the interplay the fiction and the life, for one. Why did Hazel Motes and Julian and Tarwater and Rayber come out in just that form? When Cash discusses the connections between O'Connor's mother, Regina Cline O'Connor, and Mrs. Hopewell (in \\"Good Country People\\"), her book takes on life. More, more! Again, without naming it or discussing it at any length Cash points to the self-loathing that was the other side of O'Connor's spirituality and selflessness. The presentation needs pointing up, development.<br />For another, a sense of O'Connor's achievement as an artist. The fiction, which is what counts or we wouldn't be reading the life, is almost not there. My own judgment is that the two novels matter much less than and are ungainly compared to half a dozen stories, in which form perfectly embodies vision--with humor, intellectual force, and the many-sidedness of a great writer. This text needs more engagement with O'Connor's text.<br />Finally, Edward F. O'Connor, the father. His death, when his daughter was fifteen, surely underlies what Cash describes as the \\"matriarchal\\" world of the fiction. If it bears on Flannery O'Connor's own atrophied love life and even for her choice of *What Maisie Knew* as the work of Henry James that most interests her, those connections should be made. Cash has the facts, but the figure in the carpet needs highlighting. Otherwise, one might as well read Sally Fitzgerald's nineteen page biographical sketch at the end of the Library of America volume on O'Connor.<br />It is unfair to blame the author for this, but the decorative peacock feather ovals make the page numbers hard to read!should be made.

US	52600189	R3CCZE4ZET99Y3	0393318400	848564430	Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W. C. Fields	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Give Him an Even Break	Although I have reservations, Simon Louvish's *Man on the Flying Trapeze* is a thoroughly competent job, strong in many areas. Louvish paints the vaudeville show circuit out of which Fields's later inimitable character was born with just the right amount of detail. Fields's earliest years were spend both in America and in Europe as one of a series of variety acts presented as part of an evening's performance (he was often on stage for only 12 minutes), and Louvish recreates this ambiance with some deftness, not easy to do when researching materials 90 years old. The Ziegfeld Follies live again! Similarly, by the time Fields starts in motion pictures in 1915, and with an explicitness that grows throughout the book, Louvish gets behind Fields's connection with the studios that filmed him. Chapter 23 on the now obscure producer J. P. McEvoy is a great piece of detective work: here is a key figure who underlies most of Fields's most sympathetic satirical postures.<br />Louvish doesn't claim to have figured out what he cannot: what caused the breakdown of Fields's marriage to Hattie Hughes? A biography that does include many of Fields's well-known lines--\\"Have you had this tooth pulled before?\\"--and reprises the best skits has much else to relish: e. g., the movie studio atmosphere and the hilarious objections to Fields's then-too-smutty-but-now-tame-enough gags. Louvish represents dutifully if a little thinly Fields's decline from illnesses brought on by alcoholism.<br />Now a few cavils. We need more on why William Claude Dukenfield was able to transform his life into comedy. Why could he and not others sublimate his anger and tensions first into juggling and then into physical and finally verbal humor? If the book needs the inspiration of genius to answer this point, that nevertheless is what a Fields fan wants. It also needs a fuller, richer aesthetic and intellectual context in appraising Fields's films. Less consequentially, Louvish on occasion needs more distance from Fields; adopting the master's voice in the narrative (\\"Never give a sucker an even break, particularly when he might be your biographer,\\" p. 165) blurs the vision instead of clarifying it. There are a few factual errors: *Babbitt* was published in 1922, not 1921; the poem on p. 388 that Louvish thinks is Fields's was written by Ogden Nash (surely the W. W. Norton Company has editors for such details?)<br />Nevertheless, *Man on the Flying Trapeze* is an entertaining and illuminating biography, and I am grateful for it.

With some of the intensity of *The Bell Jar* and some of its artlessness, *Darkroom* purportedly details Jill Christman's life with disarming candor and rue. Born into a family so doggedly dysfunctional that the alternative is never an issue, the author's account of suffering bulimia, sexual abuse, and inadequate and self-centered relatives makes a sad but not an unfamiliar recipe. It is counterpointed by her many-sided love for her family and boyfriend. Interspersed throughout the scatter-shot presentation, Ms. Christman weaves the idea of art, pictorial and literary: this is a book or a photo, not life. Well, you can't have it both ways, yet if this element perforce seems insufficiently integrated, her narrative remains, despite the post-modernist consciousness, a sharply affecting story.	2002-10-12

Boswell and Thompson's trashily titled volume The Girl in Lover's Lane, (Gold Medal paperback original; Fawcett Books: Greenwich, CT: September 1953 [no title on spine]) seems fairer and is more tempered but is also less thoughtful and analytical. Kunstler's solution is dramatically wrong because he writes The Minister and the Choir Singer like a whodunit: the guilty must be among the dramatis personae. To bring in an outside third party, as Kunstler does (and as many Perry Mason mysteries do, by arranging for the Drake Detective Agency to find facts no reader could extrapolate), violates one's sense of literary fairness. Of course, life is not obliged to follow the laws of literary form.<br />Curiously, in his earlier Oceana Publications book (New York: 1960) First Degree, Kunstler hints strongly at the guilt of Jim Mills. And Boswell and Thompson, on page 24 of The Girl in Lover's Lane, casually dismiss the answer for which Kunstler earnestly argues. They also hint that the vestryman Ralph Gorsline knew more than he told; unfortunately, Gorsline had died by the time they assembled their story. Barring an unlikely disclosure--e. g., a word from one of the Mills descendants, a diary by the murderer, or a contemporary report that contains fresh data, the Hall-Mills case will probably always be unsettling and unresolved, so it seems unlikely that any solution could be more convincing than Kunstler's, however disappointing it may be.	2002-08-17

The subtitle \\"From Prometheus to Pornography\\" points to the middle ground Shattuck ultimately takes.<br />The first half of the book sets up the opposition in literary terms. Untrammeled exploration is the taking of what cultural institutions say must not be taken; Shattuck traces this exploration from the myth of the fire stealer Prometheus, through Eve's eating of the interdicted apple in the Bible and Paradise Lost, Ulysses' illicit voyage (Book XXVI, Dante's Inferno), and many other literary representations. The opposing way of approaching prohibitions is found in two instances (both written by women, a point Shattuck could make more of) of liberation that comes through self-limitation: La Princesse de Cleves and the poetry of Emily Dickinson. The second half of Forbidden Knowledge applies these oppositions to life, as in the social consequences of violent pornography (e. g., De Sade's influence on Ted Bundy) and scientific exploration (the human genome project) that seems to promise complete control over human existence. Shattuck's range of literary reference is divertingly breathtaking: Socrates and rap, Aeschylus and Woody Allen, Goethe, Ghandi, Melville, Maimonides, Walter Pater, Democritus, Roland Barthes, Perrault--aw, hell, everything: if you've taken Western Literature at any quarter-baked college or university, you'll come upon something you've read. And Shattuck will illuminate it from the alternative perspectives of pleonexia vs. portee.<br />It would have been simple-minded, easy, and instantly suspect to compose a polemic for intellectual freedom. This Shattuck does not do. He argues instead that philosophical and scientific thought--the law of infinite regress, for instance--affirms the impossibility of complete knowledge. Although human nature is such that exploration cannot be stopped, the ways in which knowledge is applied can be controlled. Incompleteness is inevitable--and humanizing. \\"Be lowly wise\\" (Paradise Lost, Book VIII).<br />I summarize shamelessly because I am confident that anyone who reads this will want the book. It is learned, original, many-sided, allusive without crowing, invigorating, earnest yet sophisticated, written with humor and grace.

Lingeman does fill in details Schorer wouldn't or couldn't and adds some tangential specifics for which devotees such as I can be grateful. A meeting between F. Scott Fitzgerald and Lewis in 1922 is sketched in (but how does Lingeman know what they talked about after they closeted themselves with a bottle of gin?); we know more about (say) the circumstances surrounding Lewis's researches for *Gideon Planish,* and Lingeman gets down to the brief nitty-gritty of Lewis's sexual performance, but he has no fresh overall understanding, nor are his specifics brought into new focus, or any special focus. Instead, he builds upon Schorer's essential claim: Lewis's limitations and strengths as a writer are his commitment to surface; his refusal to look into himself comes from the painful and constricting boyhood that stunted the writer even as it enabled him.<br />I'd nominate Schorer's biography as a great one, qualifying my appraisal only by a parodying Hemingway on Gilbert Seldes: \\"It could only have been better if Sinclair Lewis had been better.\\" The figure in the carpet, the consistent understanding that ties a book together, is vividly present on every page of Schorer. And unlike Lingeman, Schorer could talk with Lewis's two wives, plus Claude and Michael Lewis, Harry Maule, and Bennett Cerf; his account of Lewis's horrifying, seedy end in Italy is enlivened by portraits of the dermatologist Vincenzo Lapiccirella, the old servant whose refusal to discuss Lewis's alcoholism Schorer finds \\"engagingly reticent\\" (Schorer bristles with savage and delicious irony), and the enigmatic Alexander Manson. Beside Schorer, Lingeman is thin and pale, but if Lewis's fixing of quintessential American types and his sense of humor and sense of outrage appeal, you'll want to read his biography anyway, as I did.read his biography anyway, as I did.	2002-05-13

Amis is often as outraged and funny as in his best fiction (especially in the letters to Larkin). Often in literary appraisals he is acute, and he always seems true to something in himself, so that even when one disagrees--i. e., T. S. Eliot is not simply a pretentious bore--one goes along.<br />Good as this correspondence is, it isn't up to Larkin's letters because Amis doesn't believe or feel as deeply as Larkin does, nor does he have as focussed a perspective as Larkin, so the humor isn't set set off in such sharp contradistinction to a fundamental seriousness. Yet you keep reading because the book clears away cant and intellectual fustian so vigorously. Moreover, it gives just enough glimpse of Amis's biography: a sad, messy counterpoint spreads out in the background: the meanderings of a brilliant man with a zillion reactions and nothing firm to attach them to.<br />Larkin's parody of his own poem &quot;Days&quot; on page 1040 is not to be missed; it's in one of Leader's helpful footnotes.<br />This book weighs a couple of pounds, so is hard to hold--to be read at table rather than in bed.

It does not oversimplify, glorify, or disdain the work or the man. Its appraisals of Dylan (and Richard Farina, although Hadju isn't detailed or pointed enough on his novel *Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me*) and entourage seem just, convincingly contextualized, and informed by an understanding of music and the recording business. The contrasts between Farina and Dylan, Joan Baez and her sister, Eric von Schmidt and Mark Spoelstra illuminate each of these figures. Anecdotes are recounted with verve and detachment, and, if the music doesn't give Hadju as much to say as it did in his biography of Bill Strayhorn, the feeling of the times comes through just as vividly--the creativity and the squalor, with the commercial accomplishments of Dylan et. al. the focus through which greater triumphs shine.<br />Hadju writes gracefully, has come up with new material (and I know a lot of his primary sources), and sensibly has limited the time frame from from 1961-1966. For me, as I said in my notice of Howard Sounes' Dylan biography, this is the key epoch for Dylan, so he's writing to my own prejudices, but the restricted five year scope means that although Hadju's claims may appear limited, he delivers more than he claims to, exploring the interplay of market expectation and aesthetic drive, the connection between audience and internal inspiration, and the great extent to which apparently arbitrary and unconscious decisions emerge as central for an artist and his audience. It's the one book one must read if one is interested in this era and this music, and probably it would appeal even to persons not interested in it.	2001-07-22

The central situation in many of the poems is the moment of first flowering--into adult experience, love, sexuality, a new consciousness--which moment is repeated and rehearsed like an archetype. A Nicaraguan woman is raped by a stranger while her husband cuts sugar cane; it is a half desired violation. In &quot;The Babysitter,&quot; two girls mimic their teenage sitter's immature sexual antics while her two charges watch, and then later parody her, anticipating their adult lives.<br />These are lovingly preserved cries from a voice most don't hear or can't hear. They put the reader back in the world of possibility with a tenderness so fine and surely shaped that the reader can feel \\"the swell of moonlight, / and the chill under the separate eaves, / pure white and choked with love.\\" The title poem is a concentration of the whole collection, which glimmers with radiant sadness and often pain.

Almost everything Bob Dylan wrote and said up to 1966, the year of his mysterious motorcycle accident (where did it happen? how badly was he injured? Sounes is good on the difficulties of determining the facts on this point, and his end notes seem like a work of serious scholarship)--almost everything Dylan did to that point was suggestive, imaginative, and many-sided. He wrote and sung with every fiber of his being, even when he was being off-hand or putting his audience on. After 1966, for me, interest diminshes: Dylan makes commercially successful recordings, but he pulls back from the precipice. The existential edge disappears, as does the verbal ingenuity, wildness of imagination, and perfect marriage between Dylan's voice and music and the content of his songs.<br />Sounes writes a decent book, with much new and hard researched information. His prose is adequate--not overly careful or stylistically distinguished. The fact finding has been done responsibly, unlike most writing about Dylan. Sounes sees the mixture of ambition, originality, and intelligence that makes Dylan at his very best still part of the central attitudes and consciousness of many of us. He is not especially sharp on the 1960's zeitgeist. Not interested in aesthetics and with no special purchase on Dylan's artistic achievement, Sounes limns the appalling squalor of Dylan's life after the accident--the philandering, the effort to find himself again and again, Dylan's growing ruthlessness and business acumen. These topics have the fascination of tabloid journalism but ultimately matter less than the dynamic achievement of the seven albums (plus a few songs) Dylan made up to 1966, about which, like the works of the fine and high artists the songwriter admires, interest is permanent.<br />Sounes treats the early and late Dylan with the same even-handedness. This is good if you value two identically, but I think there is reason not to, and if I have to criticize the book, I'd say it lacks the force of interpretation and considered opinion of a profound mind. Rather than the work of a superior distinction, it's the flat and question-begging presentation of a journalist (I should add that many so-called scholarly books are deficient this way as well).

If I am right, this unforgettable collection works in ways analogous to the continual (but more limited) defining of JPG images on computer screens. The silences and fragments of sensuality suggest, without over delineating, an understanding that transcends them--yet (paradoxically) is of them; they becomes clearer as one abides with them. A supremely human book that lifts a reader through true mastery: line break, silence, stanzaic order, and formal exactitude display an art as careful and deliberate as anyone writing. Never insisting on what cannot be known, *The Drowned City* effortlessly moves beyond the known and carries a reader along.<br />I'm sorry if this sounds too high flown or too easily paradoxical. The fault is in my explaining, not the poems.<br />And I will say, perhaps gratuitously, that my own sensibility is not Jennifer Atkinson's. Yet read *The Drowned City,* and a new way of being will be yours, no matter who you are.<br />Isn't that what one wants from a book? And seldom if ever gets?<br />There is not one shred of manipulating: this is absolutely authentic.<br />If the first three of the five sections establish Ms. Atkinson's authority and superiority in craft and carry one along on the surface of joyously sensual (look at the luxury and balances in &quot;St. Veronica's Day&quot;), the remaining two, without abandoning the immediate appeal of the first three, will challenge every reader to deny that this immersion in density can lead anywhere but where the poems say. Read &quot;Still Life with Angel&quot;; &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; will be transformed: more frightening and freighted, with a significance that you never thought of, but that having been shown you will find inevitable.<br />The poem below seems to me supreme and so characteristic in its tropes, its sounds, its formal precision, its embrasivess that I cannot excerpt, nor do I want to (please ignore the three periods between stanzas; without them the computer program will not recognize stanza breaks):<br />  Letter from the Drowned City (III)<br />...<br />Jonah lodged three days behind the ocean's baleen gate<br />--unnoticed, unswallowed, undrowned,<br />buried alive under the sod of abreaking wave.<br />Until death discovered him there forgotten.<br />...<br />The floodwaters have all but withdrawn to the sea.<br />Love, love, the world revealed in the world<br />we were taught to pray for, saying<br />*Give,* overhead and underfoot another day.<br />...<br />Everything I own I've stolen.

While her public life proceeds along conventional lines, Caroline Kettlewell's private existence is anything but placid. The contrast between the two  results in a memoir of hypnotic intensity--reminiscent at times of a book  Kettlewell mentions that she has read three times, Sylvia Plath's *The Bell  Jar.* Thanks to Kettlewell's uncanny ability to observe herself, *Skin  Game* also offers insights of uncommon penetration and humor. Individual  scenes and remarks have stuck with me since I first read this book two  weeks ago. Distinctive and so intensely felt as to be universally  appealing, *Skin Game* is the wildest, most telling personal narrative I've  read in many, many moons. First rate!<br />Roger Lathbury	1999-08-19
