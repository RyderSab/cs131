I had to look at the publication of this book.  I thought it might be 1930. The section on Customs is really foolish.  No one arriving in Italy needs to learn  those foolish sentences about &quot;This is for my personal use&quot;,   &quot;where are customs?&quot;  The train section is useless.  Where is the smoking car?  You select the type of car you want WHEN YOU BUY YOU TICKET.    So old fashion!  It is not useful for Italian of today.!	2001-03-15

At times I thought I must have turned back the pages because I had already read the same words.  The author makes a big thing about the red dots near Gerry's ear.  When this is finally solved it takes up about half a line.	2001-03-04

When reading the book you must keep this in mind.  She makes her living by writing about The Royal Family every month.  She is going to tell this story and put them in a good light.	2001-02-26

The plot is about as interesting as her cold coffe.  The descriptions of the countryside of Indiana are well crafted. If you are snowed in and received this book as a gift it is good for an afternoon read.	2001-01-12

I am a fan of James Patterson.  The book was a real page turner right up until the last two chapters.  In fact, after the last chapter I turned the page thinking I had stuck two or three pages together.  I think Mr. Patterson got tired and just stopped writing.  The book doesnt end.  It just stops.  Thus, the story is simply awful.	2000-11-26

Italian Neighbors, are my neighbors.  Down to the barking dog you plan to  kill on the first moonless night.   Italian Eucation is the story   of my  beach and my beach club.  Down to the juke  box mother! Adultery is just  such a disappointment.  None of the humor.  None of laughing outloud.  Just  dull and overly trying too hard to impress. I have to say I disliked every  word of this book.  Not vintage Parks	2000-08-30

I found them lacking.  Now, this writer and this book take you into the heart of Venice. He captures the italian personality so  well.  For those of you  who have visited Venice you will relive the  experience.  Great read.  Don't miss it!   The previous reader didnt enjoy  Zen drinking his expresso con grappa.  It is the national drink. CinCin	2000-06-26

I fully agree with the reviewers who hated it.  It has no plot.  The woman, Ana, is most annoying.  I thought if I read about her long, going gray  hair, one more time I would scream. I actually thought my book was missing  pages when I came to the end.  I re read the last chapter to see if I had  skipped the ending. I will put Ms King on my don't buy list for the future.	2000-06-20

I had recently bought CITY SECRETS ROME.  An excellent guide book.  The recommended reading in this book listed Iain Pears mysteries set in Italy.   I bought GIOTTO'S HAND and THE RAPHAEL AFFAIR.  I found them both extremely  disappointing. If the previous reders found  the books filled with the  cultural and sights of Italy perhaps they might like a trip to San Jose.    I am at a complete loss as to why authors of CITY SECRETS ROME thought  visitors to the city would benefit from Giotto's Hand and The Raphael  Affair.  They won't in my opinion.	2000-06-16

The story jumps from one location to another.  The Ireland section is a  mess as far as plot goes.  The Newport section not much  better.  Yes, the Devil made James Patterson write this ccompletely  terrible book	2000-05-26

So I bought the hard cover.  It is so bad I  almost did't finish it.  The murders are never explained.  The characters are all gray and you need a guide to tell them apart.  In the end you think to yourself,&quot;That is it?&quot;  Mrs.  Martin, not your best effort.	2000-03-14

He then repeats all the English words at least twice.  This is most annoying. English speakers know &quot;go&quot; and &quot;can&quot;  upon hearing the words the frist time.As the lesson progresses he does not  expalin the transfer from the present to the past or the future.  He tells  you the lesson is on page 13 when it is actually on 15.  Highly over rated.   Not worth the price..	2000-01-22
