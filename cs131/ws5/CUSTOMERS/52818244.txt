Does your pulse race a bit?<br /><br />IF you define gothic as moody, haunted, thrilling, and a bit frightening, you want to read Winterset.  Candace Camp is a wonderful writer.  Her stories never disappoint me, her characters always entertain me.  Winterset has a good plot and the characters provided a good reed (pun intended).<br /><br />I know some reviewers might feel there wasn't enough romance in Winterset (which is a subjective thing.  Frankly, there was plenty of romance for me.  Enough to make me root for the characters, but not so much that it was just one big \\"suck face fest.\\"<br /><br />I particularly liked the Uncle Charles character - with his unsettling madness.<br /><br />WARNING:  SPOILER COMING<br /><br />My only negatives were:<br /><br />1.  Mrs. Bennett's speech and behavior (and even her name) was right out of a Jane Austen novel.  She seemed too pat, too to type.<br /><br />2.  The ending bummed me out.  I know it is a romance and everything had to be tied up neatly, with a pretty little bow.  Frankly, though, I would have preferred it if Anna truly was related to mad people.  I would have liked the hero to make a declaration that he would love her through sanity and madness, and society be damned.  The author's ending seemed a bit too convienent, a way to appease the superficial romance readers who would not like a heroine from a mad family.  That's sad to me.  I say, let her be from stark raving lunatics.  It makes her more sympathetic and her achievements greater.	2004-11-14

I write this glowing review not just because I am a fan of the supremely talented actor and author, Harvey Fierstein, but because the book is genuinely good.<br />The story of Elmer, the different, special ducking is unique.  It is funny and touching.<br />Anyone who has ever had a son that was different from the other boys, a son who preferred dress-up to football, baking to Pokemon, will appreciate this book.<br />My son does not play football or rough and tumble sports.  He would rather read about knights or pirates or Napoleon.  He would rather dress up as a Ninja or King than kick a soccer ball.  He is not like the other boys his age --- he is more sensitive and compassionate.  He is fiercly loyal and terribly creative.<br />If you have a unique, special little guy in your life, this is the book for him.<br />Oh, and I like to think of Elmer as Sassy - willing to fly his own course - rather than Sissy.	2003-11-11

Everything feels a bit formulaic for the first half of this book. Outspoken spinster virgin? Check. Tortured, repressed hero? Check. Chaotic meeting of the Bridgertons and the new love interest? Check. Numerous references to how beloved the Bridgertons are? Check.\\"<br />Well now, whenever Romantic Times gives a scathing review, I find myself cracking my knuckles and clicking as fast as I can on Amazon.com.  I buy said book and read it with enthusiasm.  Sometimes I agree with Romantic Times.  Most times, I do not.<br />In this case, I found myself torn.  I sorta agreed with the reviewer, but then I didn't.<br />I am not tired of the Bridgertons.  In fact, I think Eloise is the most entertaining Bridgerton of the lot.  She is witty, daring, and wonderfully flawed.  I liked her vulnerable side - especially when shown during a little pre-matrimonial chat with her mother.  It was a touching scene - one I thoroughly enjoyed.<br />The rub here was Phillip.  Ugh. Sir Pathetic.  He mopes around, feeling miserable, acting moody.  He is a painfully inept father.  And there's no real explanation for it.<br />And what about his dead wife?  What was her deal?  Why didn't we ever find out why she killed herself?  It was vaguely implied that she had post-partum depression. But then, if I had to live with that drab, sad-sack Phillip, I would have pre, post, and perpetual depression.  I kept hoping maybe the ex wife had an affair with Phillip's brother.  Now that would have made sense.<br />So the ex just had the post-baby blues?  And where was Mister Wonderful Sir Phillip?  Digging around in his garden?  Playing in his potting shed?  Not very compassionate or heroic.<br />Julia Quinn is a talented writer.  Her dialogue is unmatched.  The wit in this book - as delivered by Eloise - was brilliant - which is why I give it a four.  Still, Sir Phillip was a drag and really makes the book deserve more like a 2.95.I give it a four.

The book starts early in his love life; from his first, tender love, and follows him to those final, tragic days on St. Helena.  Along the way, the reader is allowed a wonderfully, voyeristic peek into Nappy's varied, tumultuous, and sexy love life.  The writing is superb, but what makes this book truly fun to read is the details, the remarkable details, like Napoleon didn't like green beans and freaked out when he found a green bean string still attached.  The best story is the one when, as cadet, he was told he would be punished for a naughty act by being forced to eat his food on the floor.  He replied, \\"I will not do it.  In my house we kneel only before God.  Only before God.  Only before God!\\"  That wacky Corsican!<br />Mr. Hibbert gives the reader a balance of the negative and the positive attributes that made up the complex, enigmatic Napoleon.  My only negative was that he seemed to whiz through the telling of Waterloo.	2003-02-23

In New World, New Love, she proves she is as talented at creating a well thought out plot and a bevy of believable, engaging characters as she ever was.<br />The heroine, Louise de Vailly, is sympathetic and complex.  Her spoiled, selfish sister adds just the right amount of color to make this book another Laker masterpiece.<br />The hero is good but. . .frankly, I liked the doctor so much better.  I was disappointed when events unfolded that were not to my hoping (don't want to spoil it for you).<br />For the die-hard Laker fans, this book may not be as sweeping as you would like, but for the average romance reader, this book is far better than the average, formulaic fare currently being offered.

So, it was with great anticipation I purchased Lady of Desire.  Although Ms. Foley's ability to craft witty dialogue and an entralling world of characters is unchanged, Lady of Desire was not one of her finer offerings.  I had a HUGE problem with Jacinda, the heroine.  She was spoiled, stupid, and, well, frankly, ....<br />I found it difficult to believe that a proper, well-raised Regency Miss would allow her ... to be digitally probed by a man after having only known him for ten minutes (and while covered in the most horrid stench).  I felt this was a cheap and lazy ploy to make the hero appear more exciting and to intensify the relationship between two opposites.<br />Normally Ms. Foley's novels are filled with interesting historical details.  What happened here?  She uses a few phrases that are so modern, or have such a modern ring, that it had my teeth aching.  \\"I've got your back.\\"  Come on.<br />I gave this three stars because the writing is still very good and Billy Blade was exciting and sympathetic, if not totally believable.<br />Trust me, it pains me to write this as I really respect Ms. Foley's writing.  Still, despite everything I have said, the lite reader would find this novel thoroughly satisfying.	2003-02-12

I purchased WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE IN THE ENLIGHTENMENT and loved it for the myraid of tiny details,fascinating illustrations and concise chronological layout of the political, economical, and social scene.  I am less impressed with WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE IN EUROPE'S ROMANTIC ERA.  The opening chapters hop around between 1800 and 1840 with dizzying speed and the novice French historian would be hard pressed to follow.<br />The images are wonderful, but the scope of this book was too grand and the facts are condensed and thrown at the reader too fast, never really letting them learn and appreciate the rich society that was 19th century Europe.	2003-01-18

A chaste young woman walking alone, in search of solitude.  Suddenly!  A dashing man appears on the scene - dropping in front of the virgin's path and stealing a kiss from her lush, suprised mouth.<br />Ah!  Such promise in the opening.  The excitement of a stollen kiss.  The anticipation of future contact.  Can't you feel the thrill?<br />Well enjoy it, for like that pint of Ben and Jerry's, the experience is rich with flavor but leaves you feeling guilty afterwards.<br />A Promise in a Kiss is frightfully disappointing.  A whipped up confection all sugary - like cotton candy - but lacking any real substance.<br />Frankly, Helena is a bore.  She is flat and her goal seems weak.  She allows herself to become this man-tempting tease but is still at heart an innocent?  Please.  Not bloody likely in 18th century Paris - even if she was reared in a convent (a sanctuary that frequently gave shelter to fallen and disgraced women).<br />Sebastien certainly has promise - though he seems to have been copied from the infinitely more enjoyable novel/movie St. Ives.<br />This was my first - and probably my last - Laurens novel.	2003-01-18

As a teenager, I nurtured those tender feelings by watching Armand Assante play the Emperor in Napoleon and Josephine.  And, as a woman, I devoured books about Napoleon's life.  How is it then, that I did not hear about DESIREE until I was well into my thirties?<br />Knowing I sometimes enjoy historical romance novels, my mother recommended Desiree to me.  Now that I have read Annemarie Selinko's masterpiece, I would categorize it more as a sweeping historical novel than a romance. True, there are some tender scenes between Napoleon and Desiree (I melted when he sent her the sable to keep her warm), but it is hardly a romance.<br />The first person narration was a bit annoying at times - and the writer clearly shifted POV several times per chapter, but still, it is well written and amazingly well researched (only a few errors that I could spot, one of which being the mention of inbreeding being the cause of medical problems.  This was something that wasn't fully realized or appreciated until the reign of Queen Victoria with her hemophilia passing genes).<br />Read this book if you enjoy sweeping historicals, especially those set in the Napoleonic time period.<br />I must confess though, I much preferred Sandra Gulland's novels about Josephine B.  They give the reader a good taste of Napoleon, with a far more accurate take on the players of the time.  (Selinko, for instance, paints a picture of Napoleon's mother as being hard-working and ever-so-loving, even though that is in contradiction to recent note-worthy biographies about the Bounapartes).<br />In the end, this book was a great read.  I really had a hard time putting it down, despite my few misgivings.	2003-01-18

As is to be expected with Ms. Erickson's books, the writing is vivid and engaging.  Ms. Erickson took a complex subject matter -- not just Tsarina Alexandra, but the Russian political climate of her time -- and made it easy to understand for the casual historian.<br />An observation:  I have long been a student/collector of all things relating to Marie Antoinette and I have read Ms. Erickson's book TO THE SCAFFOLD.  I was surprised she did not make the connections between Antoinette and Alexandra - for surely there were many.  Both women were vilified by their husband's subjects.  Antoinette was called the Austrian Whore, Alexandra the German Whore.  Both women attempted to learn French - and both women struggled with the language.  Both women responded to criticism in childish ways (Antoinette, in leading a frivilous life, thereby lending credence to the pamphleteers charges.  Alexandra, by drawing spiteful portraits).  Perhaps Ms. Erickson would consider writing a book titled:  The Shared Traits of Tragic Queens - Josephine, Antoinette, Alexandra<br />My only negative comment would be that Ms. Erickson seemed to provide little original information.  A perusal of her FOOTNOTES shows that she relied heavily on previously written biographies.<br />Still, all in all, a fabulously enthralling read.	2003-01-04

I was well-informed about the interesting and somewhat sad life of the secret wife of King George IV, so I wasn't too sure how I would feel about reading a novel about her.  I mean, I thought I might be bored.  I was wrong.  Diane Haeger is a talented author, with an ability to create characters that are believable and larger than life.  I especially liked her take on Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.  Most historians paint her as this wonderfully independent woman - see Amanda Foreman's fantastic biography - but Haeger really brings out a bitchy side of Georgiana that made for a great read.<br />Anyone who likes historical fiction or historical romance will enjoy this novel.	2002-10-30

I had the good fortune of hearing Catherine Mann speak at a workshop two years ago.  She was dynamic, enthusiastic, generous, and dedicated.

The plot is exciting, thrusting the reader into a normally closed world (military).  The characters are so identifiable and compelling.<br />Major Grayson Clark is a hero and a hunk.  Of course, being married to a real-life AF pilot makes me biased.  But there's something more here than a babe-magnet in a flight suit and Ray-bans.

I'll be honest, I don't usually read books from this genre.  I am an historical fiction and romance writer and reader, but I am always open to learning new things about my craft.  So, 36 hours ago I began reading Expose, paying close attention to the plot line.  I have to tell you, I really enjoyed this book (I have even already ordered the sequel).  I think Ms. Van Wormer is a talented writer, with a knack for characterization and multi-dimensional plots. If I had to point out a negative, it would be about the heroine, Sally Harrington.  She was supposed to be a talented reporter, and yet, she irriated the hell out of me.  Granted, my career in newspaper and magazine journalism only extends back 13 years now, and is not nearly as impressive and glamourous as writing for a fanscy-schmancy LA glam mag, but Sally really had me gritting my teeth in a few places.  For instance, when she goes into her big-time &quot;career making/breaking&quot; interview and starts sobbing over some idiot she had casual and dangerous sex with (in New York City for God's sake).  Later, she casually drops in on her subject at home (how rude and unprosfessional is that?). At the end of the novel she receives a job as an investigative reporter and yet throughout the novel she has been too blind and stupid to figure out the casual sex guy was a set-up and philanderer?  Come on! That being said, I admired Sally's tireless energy and her sense of humor.  She also possessed two qualities lacking in many journalism professionals - compassion and decency. All in all, a very great read.<br />Leah Marie Brown, Author of Willing Captive [...]	2001-07-31

Reviewer: Leah Marie Brown from North Charleston, SC United States If you have looked at other titles by this author, you know I am a rabid Rosalind Laker fan. In my opinion, To Dance With Kings, a historical romance novel set in Versailles, is the finest in the genre. The Golden Tulip, set in 17th century Amsterdam, is a romance with dark under-currents which make it a multi-faceted novel. Banners of Silk, The Venetian Mask, and Gilded Splendour are also fine novels, steeped in information about antique trades and steaming with passionate romances. So, what was it about Tree of Gold that touched me in a way as to ellicit tears? The gentle tug and pull of the heroine's heart-strings was endearing and the simple twists of fate that conspire to keep her from her lover is teeth-gnashingly frustrating. When Gabrielle, after years of secretly loving Nicolas, is kept from him because of circumstances beyond her control, I burst out crying. &quot;NO, No, NO!,&quot; I screamed. My husband, hearing my distressed cry, came running in the room. After giving me a hug, he handed me a box of Kleenex and left the room (he knows better than to lecture me on getting too wrapped up in my romance novels!) Buy this book, it is a fascinating look at the world of silk production and a bitter-sweet tale of love. Leah Marie Brown, Author of Willing Captive, available NOW!	2001-01-17

In the Author's Note, Ms Laker writes, &quot;Although letters, bills, and receipts authenticate Chippendale's masterpieces as well as the simple household items he supplied, from servants' beds to tea-trays, comparatively little is known of his personal life.&quot;  From those few details, Laker weaves a magnificent and compelling story about one of the world's most talented furniture designers and makers.<br />The events which occur in Gilded Splendour center around Chippendale's life, even though he is not always the focus of the story.  A fictional character, Isabella Woodleigh, who finds herself linked to Chippendale, also helps to carry the plot.  The two separate stories, like individual threads forming a quilt, are slowly woven together until one believes Isabella Woodleigh and Thomas Chippendale were actually involved.<br />The characters are so well defined you might discover you are gritting your teeth at the thankless and cruel Sarah Woodleigh, sister of the heroine and one of the villain's in this novel.  You might find yourself crying out in pain at the lost opportunities of love between a few of the characters.  The simple twists of fate that keep certain characters from living happily ever after together will have you gnashing your teeth in exquisite frustration.<br />The only negative comment I have to make about this novel is sudden appearance of one major character, Owen Marwell.  The relationship between him and Isabella Woodleigh, the heroine, develops rapidly with little attention given to their courtship or the flourishing of tender love.  Isabella, healing from a loveless marriage and the sudden death of her repulsive marriage, seems to fall into bed with Marwell, and this does a serious disservice to her character, which had been sketched as a woman of straight-laced morals.<br />Laker, a master at descriptive literature, splendidly details Chippendale's pieces without boring the reader. Chapter by chapter, she painstakingly describes the efforts that went into Chippendale's work and his impressive abilities at marquetery, veneering and gilding.<br />After reading her novel, I could clearly picture a secretaire and silver looking glass with candelabra.  I was delighted to then visit Thomas Chippendale at Harewood House and look at the pieces she described.  I could pick them out easily from her descriptions., splendidly details Chippendale's pieces without boring the reader.

US	52818244	R270HY82S5PX1I	075051440X	732711324	Banners Of Silk	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Banners Of Silk unfurls beautifully	Set in elegant post-Napoleon Paris, Banners of Silk tells the story of young and impoverished dress designer Louise Vernet.  The story opens as the newly orphaned Louise meets a grisette, Catherine Allard, who takes her in and fosters her.  Louise works hard, learning every thing she can about the art of dress designing, eventually establishing herself at one of the premier maison de couture. The romance in this novel is raw and complex, and more real than most romance novels.  Louise falls innocently in love with one man but soon out-grows her feelings for him.  Next, Louise falls in love with a dashing military man whose inherent short-comings cause her anguish.  Finally, Louise finds love with a friend.  Although the ending was a bit of a disappointment for the romantic at heart, Laker's sharp characterizations and attention to historical details make Banners of Silk a thoroughly enjoyable read.  Frankly, I did not see huge comparisions between To Dance With Kings and Banners of Silk (as the above review implies) but, as a writer, I understand that a good writer does have a unique and distinct style.  Ms. Laker's is the finest I have ever read in the genre of historical romance.  Buy this book, you would never be disappointed with her efforts.

US	52818244	R1PLRDBTXGZEBV	0385415605	530416060	Golden Tulip, The	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A Blooming Good Read	The Golden Tulip is set in 17th Century Amsterdam and deals with artists guilds.  The heroine, Francesca Visser, is a talented and inspired young artist who finds her life turned upside down when her mother dies.  When Francesca's father loses a small fortune gambling, he affiances her to a ruthless and diabolical merchant, Ludolf van Deventer.  First, though, she is allowed to complete an apprenticeship with the Delft painter Vermeer, where she perfects her skills and meets famous Flemish artists.  Along the way, she meets her true love, Pieter van Doorne, a tulip-grower.  Together, Pieter and Francesca find a way to defeat the evil van Deventer.  The story also features Francesca's two sisters, Aletta and Sybylla, who have their own adventures and love affairs.  The Golden Tulip is a superbly written novel from an extremely gifted story-teller.  The story offers history, romance, and a solid plot.  It is also emotionally sweeping - drifting between red-hot passion, touching devotion, dark hostility and obsession.  The black under-currents, accurate historical details, and sizzling romance in this novel help it to fall into several different categories: thriller, historical, romance.	2001-01-13

I still own the original copy, though it is dog-eared, artistically marked with Crayolas, and gingerly held together by copious amounts of Scotch tape.  I treasure this book because the message is universal and timeless:  At times, we all feel unappreciated, overlooked, drab, blah-like.  My mother, a single parent who worked her fingers to the bones, was often too tired to engage in the activities many stay-at-home Mom's engaged in with their children.  I often felt overlooked in the hustle and bustle, daily scramble that was her life.  She was aware of this and gave me THE BLAH By Jack Kent.  The Blah tells the story of one little boy who feels terribly Blah like.  His older brother, in a hurry and not paying attention, crushed his favorite crayon.  His mother, distracted with her many motherly and domestic tasks, doesn't really listen to him.  So, he draws pictures that tell the story of a group of beings called &quot;Blah's&quot;.  There is a King of The Blah's, an Awful Jostler who breaks crayons.  It's a darling story and ends on a very loving and happy note. I know this book is hard to come by but it is a wonderful book for anyone child, especially those children who have single parents, super-mom's, or full-time working parents.	2001-01-04

I read Karleen Koen's novel, Through A Glass Darkly, several years ago and was spell-bound.  I have always loved historical romance novels but this one broke the mold, with surprising plot twists and flawed heroines.  My first novel, Willing Captive, was published in November 2000.  I am proud of it...until I read Koen's novel again, then I feel compelled to work harder and write tighter. This is a fantastic novel.

I have walked through the Hall of Mirrors and had a picnic at Le Hameau (Marie Antoinette's private Hamlet on the grounds of Versailles). I have watched in awe as the fireworks blazed in the sky over the dancing fountains at Versailles during the Fete de Nuit.<br /><br />ROSALIND LAKER'S novel, TO DANCE WITH KINGS, comes very, very close to actually being at the Chateau Versailles. It is a vibrant, brilliant novel with engaging characters, a tightly woven storyline, and flawless historical accuracy.<br /><br />It is an epic, multi-generational tale that tells the stories of four women:  Marguerite, Jasmin, Rose, and Violette.  Set in France, the story sweeps from the time of the Sun King to the fall of the anciene regime, with the glittering Versailles as the constant backdrop.  It is a superb piece of historical fiction, with plenty of romance, heart-ache, and drama by one of the most gifted writers of the genre.<br /><br />Leah Marie Brown, Author of Willing Captive	2000-12-30

Still, I think THE SUGAR PAVILION was sweet and sinfully addictive.  As with most of her books, I could not put it down until the last emotion-wrought page was read.  I liked Sophie Delacourt more than any other Laker character because she was fleshed out wholly.  She was smart, determined, independent to a fault.  I disagree with the above review and did not find the &quot;side story&quot; of Prinny - George IV (not the V) - and Maria Fitzherbert distracting.  If I wanted an in depth lesson on Prinny and his not-so-secret wife, I would read Prince of Pleasure.  I like historical romances.  And this one is sheer perfection, a delightful morsel!	2000-12-30

I have long been obsessed with Marie Antoinette.  I am, in fact, writing a book set in the court of Louis XVI.  You can imagine my delight when I was informed about the pending release of Ms. Thomas's book.  I had hoped her  book would provide many examples of libel against the queen.  I was hoping  this book would detail who wrote what and when.  I found this book to be an  excuse to print a lot of nasty words.  Ms. Thomas's views, while educated,  were tired and repeated over and over again.  Nothing in this book was  thought-provoking or fresh.  It did not illuminate or entertain.  Very  little was devoted to the effects of the words against the queen.  How did  this effect MA emotionally, physically?  What did it do to the marriage of  the King and Queen?  What were the long-term impacts of these libelous  ditty's?  How did they effect journalism as we know it today?  How did they  contribute to the Revolution? All in all, a disappointment.	2000-01-13
