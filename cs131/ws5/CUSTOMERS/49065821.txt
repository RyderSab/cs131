(In fact not one man died on any Polar expedition he led, save himself from a heart attack at the start of his last one) But he was also the man who beat Scott and Wilson's furthest south record by over 360 miles in 1908-1909 and got to within 100 miles of the Pole. When asked by his wife how he had withstood the temptation to go on and take a gamble on his life with the odds stacked heavily against him and his men on the return journey he replied: 'I thought you would prefer a live donkey to a dead lion'. Now that is sheer bravery. If Scott constantly saw him as an ally and not as a rival and enemy (Scott's cruelty to Shackleton during his Discovery expedition triggered off their mutual loathing for each other)then he would have learned much and probably would have lived longer.	2002-03-03

It is one of those biographical pieces (It also serves as a bio on Scott and Amundsen) which makes you almost believe that you are there with these men.<BR>In saying this however (And I stress that I am a Shackleton person and don't rate Scott much) I question how exact it is in that there is so much debunking of Scott that Huntford seems to just stop short of accusing him of murder (I am also amazed that Sir Peter Scott did not sue Huntford when the book first came out, it says much about the man)with regards to Oates walking to his death. I do agree that Amundsen was a brilliant tactician at Polar exploration and Scott was an arrogant incompetent, but Amundsen was also a bit of a glory-seeking oppurtunist and Scott did have some decent remarkable talents, telling a good story for one, that would have been best suited in areas other than Polar exploration. If the RGS, Markham, Scott etc.. had a dangerous fault it was that they allowed emotions pervade areas where sentimentality was destructive.	2002-02-08

The Paul of this book certainly fits the physical and characteristic picture I have of him, small and gangly and yet the ability to hold people's attention within an instant.

The animals well meaning idea of a Utopian farm being cruelly destroyed by a corrupt pig and his minions, is a brilliant parallel of a human desire to build a Utopian Heaven on Earth being knocked sideways by the corruptibility and sinfulness that exists in all humans. You end up feeling intensly sorry for Boxer, wishing that Snowball would come back, hoping that the animals have the guts to start a rebellion fairly early on and trying to avoid a sneaking and vindictive desire to see Napoleon and Squealer packed off to the nearest abitoir and served as rashers of bacon on a farmers breakfast plate.	2001-09-10

It is also seen as a line of defence against sexual irresponsibility which is unscriptual. I wonder whether that justifies the argument against contraception but it is worth reading in order to see a well thought and considered argument and that one needs to be prepared against those who wish to use the argument for contraceptives to justify fronication and practising homosexuality.	2001-01-09

Charles Ashworth is now Bishop of Starbridge with a cosy well structured life. Then his wife dies suddenly, his bad relationship with the Dean of Starbridge Cathederal takes a turn for the worse, one of his Curates gets beaten up and pornographic material is found at his home, his sons problems get worse. In all this Ashworth realises that his belief in absolute truths, laudable though they are, must never come at the expense of compassion and the humility that a clergyman, particually a Bishop, needs. I strongly recommend it.	2000-11-14

It is well written and well researched and  fairly honest a book, as well as fairly balanced as far as the author will  let herself.

Venetia Flaxton, twentysomething, from an agnostic aristocratic  family has a passionate adulterous affair with Neville Asygarth, who is now  Dean of Sarbridge Cathederal (In 'Ultimate Prizes' he was Archdeacon of  Starbridge). Both use Robinson's 'Honest to God' has an excuse, that all  are called to 'love' but this 'love' has serious repucussions that damage  Asygarth's family even further, sends Venetia into a spiral of depression  and addiction, and rocks the immediate Cathederal community.<br />It is also  interesting to see the regulars again, albeit twenty years older. Charles  Ashworth is now Bishop of Starbridge, and his two sons have interesting  'psyches' as Jon Darrow would put it. Jon Darrow himself is a retired  'hermit' following the death of his wife, his son Nicholas is psychic  himself, but is also highly immature. The multi-faced expolation of the  characters and their '3-D descrpitions of their personalities makes you eel  that you know them, and you soon find yourself rooting for various  individuals and even feel compassion and concern for those you dislike	2000-08-31

I think that says more  about my theological stance and my belief in Absolute Truths more than  anything else, but it is also due to the fact that Asygarths unwillingness  to face facts causes damage to himself and others, both emotionally and  spiritually in his quest for the Ultimate Prizes. For this is the backbone  of the novel. Archdeacon Asygarth, a liberal, and yet a comappsionate and  admirable believer (In fact this is where I hold him in high esteem) in  Christs grace and atonement despite whatever upset, goes for the 'Prizes'  the wordly type things that he believes will make him happy, which will  'rescue' him from his troubled childhood. 'Ultimate Prizes' shows how this  came to a head and how Jon Darrow helped him fully realise his vocation  (not just a priestly one) and also his need for vulnerability before Christ	2000-08-09

After  leaving his order after seeing a vision, Darrow tries to work out his  vocation and in his attempt lets his ego and spiritual arrogance get the  better of him which leads to tragedy, but also the offer of spiritual  renewal afterwards. An excellent look at how spiritual leaders and mentors  have their own failings and the fact that they also need to be helped and  disiplined. It is an excellent argument against those who are completeley  against charismatic renewal, but also against those who are totally for it  without seeing the warning signs and the need to be answerable to someone  who you trust but who who you also don't have a cosy relationship with.	2000-08-05

Did not St Paul say we  must correct those in love! Anyway how much scholarship is in this book in  order to weigh it's merit. As Alister McGrath said in 'The Renewal of  Anglicanism' where is hard historical evidence that St Paul was a rigid gay  male! I also find the book rather aggressive and egotistical in a  way,(rather hypocritical in fact) as if Shelby Spong finds it convienient  to lump us 'fundamentalists'altogether. I also wonder whether Spong  confuses fundamentals with fundamentalists. That said I am sure he is a  nice person who cares about people (Im serious), but that is not enough  where the Church is concerned. One can find just as well find fundamental  pastoral comfort in compassionate writers like CS Lewis, or Billy Graham,  or Canon David Watson. People who care about minorites and their sufferings  with a desire to help without compromise.	2000-08-02

Having read this I realised  that he wrote this encyledal partly because he thought he would be  betraying the Church in the face of theological history and partly out of  fear as to what it would lead to. He was also a highly complex man prone to  fits of depression, and yet in some ways a warm and caring man. Like the US  President Lyndon Johnson, Paul VI has suffered unfairly partly due to  having a highly popular predessor. Sadly in Paul VI's case he also had a  highly popular successor partly due to the shortness of his reign.	2000-08-02

Undersatndably and yet in some ways, suprisingly it has turned the Church into an arena for renewal.  In different continents it means different things. For N.

Balanced  (To a degree) and forthright it has an interesting insight into the pains,  struggles and upheavals of the Church. The strange thing being that it  helped some of my theological views become more conservative and in one or  two cases more liberal.
