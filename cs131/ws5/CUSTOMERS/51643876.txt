His name is getting closer to legend and rightfully so.  One need look no further than Darkness, Tell Us.  A fascinatingly juvenille tale, filled with chewy pulpy gore, that's way over the top.  This is quite possibly the weirdest cautionary tale involving a ouija board ever; but you keep reading because you gotta see where he's going with this.  Usually with Laymon it isn't anywhere near where you thought.<br /><br />We get ghosts, a muscle bound psycho with a limited vocabulary, a survivor of childhood atrocity, and lots of violence.  There's sex, blood, and an omnipresent feeling of unease.<br /><br />Laymon puts his characters and his readers through the wringer, writing like an efficient, yet cruel, drowner.  He lets the audience gasp for breath, even letting them be lulled by seemingly calm waters before forcing them back under into the dark and depravity of his sickly sweet mind. No amount of squirming and thrashing can save you, your lungs will fill.<br /><br />So what makes Darkness, Tell Us so great?  It's yeah right fiction that's a frickin' blast to read, not for the wusses or the prudes, but for us sickos who appreciate nasty stuff happening to make believe people. This is the type of horror that kiddies definitely ought to hide from the folks.  Truly representative of Laymon's mad genius.  He was a master confectioner with a flair for the fantastic who will be sorely missed.	2004-11-05

What lay within the pages was a haunting tale of life, death, and after life commingled with some very intriguing ideas on the universe.<br /><br />If you're a fan of weird fiction check out Carroll because he is indeed a magician, pockets bulging with tricks, mesmerizing and entertaining.  He slowly pulls you along and then, WHAM, he turns it on, full throttle intensity of the highest order.  All the while retaining an amazing amount of literary integrity; it's as if Twain, Poe, and Dahl were mixing up a tale during an all night peyote session.<br /><br />\\"Chaos is not your friend.\\"	2004-11-04

Here's the basic rundown of a novel by this amazingly entertaining author.  Throw in some intrigue, a reason to frequently blow stuff up, a smidgen of romance (although this book so far had the smallest amount), a borderline excessive amount of violence, and some skewing of scientific progress potentially falling into the wrong hands.  Oh, and for dessert some whale monsters!<br /><br />I love reading this guy's work because you just get the feeling that he loves genre fiction, and it shows in the writing.  Will his books change the world?  I'd have to say probably not.  Are they a nice diversion from the flickering idiocy on the tv any given weeknight?  Hell yeah they are.  In fact I'd go so far as to recommend Mr. Rollins novels as tools to get book wary teenagers interested and passionate about reading.<br /><br />Any time a writer consistently puts out material where I stay up way past the wee hours because I just have to see what kind of craziness is going to happen next, well, that's worth telling folks about.  If you need some adrenaline in your reading material seek this guy out.<br /><br />Really, if you think about it, you should have been sold after whale monsters!	2004-10-16

His ability to turn the seemingly humdrum into the overwhelmingly nasty is downright unsettling.  This guy is a reason to read, especially if you're into Horror.  Luring you in with what seems like a formulaic setup, hell, even the title harkens back to those young adult horror novels that kept popping up in the early 90's (usually with an author last name of Pike or Stine).<br /><br />Little gives you about 10 pages before he starts slapping you around with creepiness and you'll keep turning those pages at an increasing rate of speed.  The Resort is about a family of five who escape to, surprise, a resort in the offseason that is summer in Arizona.  The Reata, first class accomodations that include ghosts giving room sevice, monsters at poolside, and viciousness free every morning on your pillow.  When you read a book by Bentley Little you can pretty much guarantee you're going to have fun.<br /><br />The Resort is all the brochure said it would be. Keep writing Mr. Little and I'll keep buying.	2004-10-05

Grabbed by the nutso cover art I sat down to read an amazingly effective tale of Indian legends and supernatural terror brought vividly to life by Robert Charles Wilson.  This gory thriller doesn't pull any punches and it has an insane vibe with some serious cult potential.  With instances of terror and trauma that are just shy of brilliant this book deserves a reprint.  I found myself actually flinching at details and cringing at circumstances and to make me do that is no small feat.  This is one of those books that makes me wish I was a film producer, it's startling imagery and well drawn characters just scream MOVIE!  Most people just don't understand how much damage a bear can do to a human body but Mr. Wilson sure does.<br /><br />If you can find this book read it, it's worth seeking out.  Especially if you live near bear country.	2004-10-04

Mr. Nicholson has given us Horror fans a nice and nasty little treat with his book The Red Church.  Small town terror, religious fervor, and one heckuva monster combine to get those sicko juices flowing.  This guy seems to like his Lovecraft and he pays a nice homage here to that New England maestro of the macabre.  Sacrifice and winged beasts are always good to keep those pages turning.  If you haven't read this guy do so now and if something from above blots out the sun, duck.  Just a suggestion.

Simon Clark's spin on vampires is amazingly original, taking the monster that's been dumbed down to a sexual fetish and turning it back into the snarling, frightening beast it once was.  These vampires aren't glamourous, they're nasty.  Clark is more than up to the task of creating scenes of shudder inducing horror and so far everything I've read by him has been along those lines.  Vampyrrhic is a nice bloody romp that immediately pulls you, dragging fears from primal corners of the imagination.  I recommend anything by this guy, he keeps writing 'em and I'll keep buying 'em.

What Mr. Keene has done here is give a refreshing twist to zombie fiction, taking the lumbering stiffs and giving them not only speed (yes I saw 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake) but a cold, calculating intelligence.  The goal of these limber undead?  To make everyone and everything part of one big happy, rotting family.  Comparisons to Matheson, Romero, and King are well founded. This tale of one desperate father searching for his child in the midst of the dead refusing to die is chock full of gore, disturbing imagery, and characters that envoke the entire gamut of human emotion.  Also, the ending maintains the level of suspense and horror that permeates the entire book and, for a horror novel, that's no small feat. For Horror fans this guy needs your immediate attention, put him on your radar, staple a post it to your forehead, carve his name into your arm. Do whatever it takes to find this book, put on a pot of coffee, and sit your donkey down to read.  You won't be going anywhere till you're done.<br />Winner of the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel.	2004-06-24

That's the gist here, but Moore infuses his story with characters that are just too darn good for a Leisure paperback.  It's true that there ain't much when it comes to extra terrestrial interaction (to put it mildly) but that's not the point.  The fear gradually shifts from the dry docked flying saucer to the government agents given the task of keeping the entire town of Collier, GA quiet.  (The media is given a story about a terrorist)  Like the best episodes of the X-Files the audience plays ping-pong between the threat of invasion and the threat of shadowy government figures calling the shots.  Only here the scenario is expanded to include the terror of martial law.  That's pretty scary.  It's a literary smack in the head, where logically the issues and priorities are eschewed in order to maintain a semblance of order and the more you read the more plausible a situation like this seems.<br /><br />This is the second book by this author that I've read and I can honestly say this fellow right here has what it takes to be another King, Koontz, or McCammon-his writing is amazingly similar to those lofty three and just as enduring.  The only way we can ever see that happen is a hardcover deal and good press and James Moore is deserving of both.  Even Hollywood could potentially make good on this story (but it'd probably get screwed up). Bloody, insightful, with well written characters, and compelling enough to keep those pages a turnin'.  Fireworks goes high on the recommendation list.  Also check out Under the Overtree.	2004-06-24

Extreme action, mutated creatures, explosives, giant jaguars, violence( including dismemberment and head shrinking!), a dash of sex, poison, betrayal, technology on the fritz, insects that will eat you alive, pirahnas that will chase you onto land, giant caimans that will jump into trees, a lost tribe, a plague threatening the world, prehistoric plants, and regenerating body parts!<br />Whew, that's a lot of stuff going on and James Rollins pulls most of it off without a glitch.  The characters are strong enough to make you care, the action is most definitely exciting, the various creatures interesting and nasty enough to shock and awe even the most poised reader.  So why not 5 stars? Well...<br />The ending could have been better, there could have been a little bit more surprise when it comes to the realization of who the \\"mole\\" is (that was kinda Scooby Doo-ish), and those who deserved horrible demises get dispatched rather quickly.<br />However, if you have read Rollins earlier work you most likely won't be dissapointed here.  No matter how you look at it this guy is damn fun to read, and his books would make excellent movies.  I know I'd buy a ticket, and speaking of buying check out Subterrranean and Excavation, both solid actioners.<br />No Tor-Tors were harmed in the writing of this review.	2003-12-05

Shocking, to say the least.  One of the best novels of ordinary people pitted against extraordinary circumstances that I have ever read.  Deceit.  Treachery.  Greed.  Murder.  An unexpectedly high body count.<br />A Simple Plan goes high on the recommendation list, if not for its brazen, machete like impact then for its amazing originality.

On Nantucket Island something dark and all together dead has started killing, horribly mangling bodies and playing head games with those who find the remains.  Detective Tim Brooks has the unfortunate luck to witness for himself the fear on the first victim's face.  Something more terrible than he can imagine is walking the island and the planes of exisistence that lie between.  The detective was a rational man until he started hearing and seeing ghosts.<br />I liked this book, the first I've read by Mr. Hynd.  The story was good, although a little slow at first.  After 60 pages I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  The characters were likeable, the action intense and scary.  The evil ghost was pretty darn vicious even if it was a little overexplained.  On a  scale of 1-10 I'd give Ghosts an 8 for being scary, fast, absorbing, and for the twist at the end.  Points off for not having enough blood and real terror.  The resolution didn't set well either.  However, as a whole the book was enjoyable, which is the point after all.  I will be reading more of Mr. Hynd in the future.  Check it out.	2003-03-19

An exploration into the very depths of human depravity and an apt dissection of how war sheds all masks.  Haunting, revolting, and most definitely life changing this tale of a prepubescent boy abandoned by war will strip the scales from any reader's eyes.<br />Kosinski takes a bleak situation and denies hope at every turn dragging his young protagonist again and again through the razor studded halls of hell.  The sorrow and horror are tangible as bullets, leaving the reader intellectually shellshocked.  Atrocities abound, all too recognizably human.<br />After reading The Painted Bird it immediately went on my list of top 20 books.  For any who read this the outcome will always be the same:  YOU WILL HATE WAR!

Mr. King is perhaps the reigning champ of the what if/how/when/why still sucking down air.  I've been a fan for a long time (even through those I didn't particularly care for) and must say that this was the first of his books that I actually paused at before buying.  Why?  Because smack dab on the cover is a car, (the title isn't hiding anything either) and I thought \\"Hey, didn't he do this before? He wouldn't repeat himself, this guy, would he?  Not Stephen King.  Nah.\\"<br />I did wonder but curiosity got the best of me and I threw down the green.<br />Nice to say I was pleasantly enjoying this book about two pages in and continued to do so until the end.  Perhaps a fear of old cars needs to be introduced to those monkeys who make up new phobias.  Like I said before King is the champ at getting people thinking maybe nothing is what we really think it is.  From a Buick 8 is proof once again that maybe we should never really trust any one sense too willingly or rely on it too much.	2003-03-14

Lemony Snicket ( a dubious moniker if there ever was, and certainly not to be trusted) has set forth the task of developing one of the most enjoyable (and downright nasty) children's series of books, aptly entitled \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\". The events that befall the hapless Baudelaire trio (Violet, Klaus, and the infant Sunny) are shocking, disturbing, cruel, and very, very unfortunate. So why read, one may ask? Well, for one thing twisted accounts of devious circumstances are always enjoyable when viewed from a distance (ie. the pages of a fictitious book, fictitious meaning \\"not real\\") and while bad things happen, even worse things are averted through intelligence, cunning, and the urge to teethe. Besides, who could resist such dark fun? It is sad, it is funny, there is an overlying sense of menace throughout but one reads in the hopes that our loveable protagonistic trio will prevail. But will they...? A Series of Unfortunate Events is a great way to get kids who are reluctant to read to do just that, much easier than say leaving such a child bound and gagged in a bird cage dangling thirty some feet above unpleasantly hard ground until they come to their senses! By no means is this series just for kids, \\"kids\\" meaning the offspring of goats, or perhaps humans? If you like Edward Gorey you'll love this series. Just pray that Lemony Snicket doesn't realize how deranged he is and decides to take medication to alleviate his madness. I, for one, enjoy it!	2001-09-25

One of violence and secrets, of magic and the paths of the dead. The curfew is observed, surely only symbolic, the church bell tolled one hundred times each night. The sounds of a bell to keep evil at bay. With the appearance of a New Age millionare intent on bringing the town back to its roots tradition is ignored, safeguards removed, and darkness once again released upon the town.<br />For fans of the genre this book is akin to Horror confection, packed with subtle terror and peppered with well timed gore, references to pagan rituals and occult phenomena the filling and the icing. A true contender for one of the top 20 Horror novels of the last decade. Recommended wholeheartedly. Beware Black Michael!	2001-09-25

His method of killing is a quiet one, poison laced Southern Comfort.  Lew McCreary's novel is spellbinding, using a finely tuned skill to make the reader care for, if not love a murderer.  And a mass murderer at that.  Van Siegert is one of the most fascinating characters I've come across in recent memory.  His calm descriptions of killing are intended to convey a sense of normalcy in murder.  The fact that he kills for no reason is scary enough, the idea that he can easily validate his murders is terrifying.  If you are a fan of novels about psycho killers but want something that's not a slasherflick on the page, check out this book!<br />The Minus Man was made into an excellent film starring Owen Wilson (in a sorely overlooked performance) as the quiet, yet lethal Van Siegert.

He tells me everything.&quot;	Necroscope is the amazing beginning to a fantastic Horror novel series that introduces one of Horror fiction's most entertaining and interesting characters.  Harry Keogh, the Necroscope, blessed or cursed with the ability to speak with the Dead.  And while the living are many, the dead are more; for in Brian Lumley's epic vision there is no Heaven or Hell but an eternal limbo where the mind/soul live on.  A purgatory to put any Catholic to shame.  Necroscope gives the reader Harry Keogh's background (a very interesting childhood, to say the least) and explains that the world is filled with people who have psychic abilities in varied potency.  And, there are Vampires.  Vampires that are much more than we could have ever imagined...<br />This novel focuses mainly on how Harry comes to realize and then master his power on the side of good, and how on the side of evil (Vampires/Soviets) a dark agent hones his skills as a Necromancer(he very gruesomely tortures the dead for information)<br />Most importantly this novel leaves no question that the story and subsequent adventures of Harry Keogh, Necroscope will continue, and that is a promise that Brian Lumley has obviously fulfilled.  Necroscope is an amazing beginning to one of the best Horror series ever and makes continued reading of the Necroscope books not only desirable but necessary for the reader who has read this Horror masterpiece.<br />&quot;One must never curse the dead, I suppose, for they have nothing to lose.&quot;	2001-03-12

At first you think you are reading a detective novel, and then a Horror novel, and then decidedly, the demented offspring of both genres.<br />Low rent private eye, Harry Angel is recruited to find a pre-war crooner by the name of Johnny Favorite, a singer indebted to Angel's client.  A client by the name of Louis Cyphre.  Angel's pursuit of Johnny Favorite takes him to the seediest of locales in mid 1950's New York and enlightens him on the city's darker side.  A world of witchcraft and voodoo and unspeakable rituals.  All the while Harry Angel is trying to deal with his own amnesia.  As the mystery unfolds so does the terror and slowly as each piece is revealed Harry Angel walks the tightrope of madness.  Not only is Falling Angel an intelligently crafted Horror novel it is incredibly vicious as well.  Yet strangely it seems to be more of a cult favorite than a Horror novel that everybody knows.  All I can say is that it is one of the most original Horror tales I have ever read, impossible not to read in one sitting.  It was made into a movie called Angel Heart that follows the basic outline of the story and the plot but does some shifting of locales not seen in the book.  The movie was good, the book a thousand times better.  A must read for Horror fans.	2001-03-12

A once gentle St. Bernard driven mad by sickness from the bite of a rabid bat.  A St. Bernard that once would have been considered harmless in just a few short days turns into a mindless killing machine, and St. Bernard's are BIG!  Stephen King pulls no punches with this book and the terrifying encounters the hapless characters have with Cujo are the stuff of Horror novel legend.  Cujo is truly one of Stephen King's finest hours as a writer, all the way up to the heart wrenching ending.  If you are a Stephen King fan, a Horror fan, or just like really good, involving writing Cujo is a book for you.<br />&quot;The entire spectrum of the aural world was his.

Who could possibly conceive of such a notion?  Why, Dean Koontz of course!<br />For young novelist Tommy Phan terror comes in the form of a rag doll.  A rag doll with a secret inside.  A secret with reptillian eyes and murderous intellect.  A creature that starts out small and keeps on getting bigger...<br />As always with Dean Koontz the entertainment level is high, the action intense, the characters so damn loveable (I want a Scootie, dammit!)  Koontz's writing seldom fails to entertain and with TickTock he hits his desired mark ( The B movie offspring of a screwball comedy and a Horror novel).  I must admit that my suspension of disbelief was thoroughly taxed, especially at the end.  But if you're not willing to do that in the first place why read fiction?<br />I read this in two sittings (stopping only to go to work) and enjoyed it immensely.

My favorites were The Langoliers (of which I am glad the source material for the mini-series was much more entertaining and enjoyable) and The Library Policeman.  The other two novellas, Secret Window, Secret Garden and The Sun Dog were both capable of producing genuine thrills and chills, just not as many as I would have liked.<br />The Langoliers, a what if story that boldly asked and answered the question &quot;What happens to today when tommorrow takes its place?&quot;  was engrossing and frightening.<br />The Library Policeman was just plain vicious, Stephen King at his shocking best.  Making a library a threatening place takes true talent.<br />Secret Window, Secret Garden was too much like the Dark Half for me to really enjoy.<br />The Sun Dog was interesting to a point, but the entire story relied on the stupidity of one man (and the damn solution to the problem was so friggin' simple!)  Nevertheless, the story did take us to Castle Rock and that's one locale to which I will always gladly return.<br />Bottom line, if you're a Stephen King fan you should check this out.  Two of the stories are awesome, the other two pretty darn good.	2001-01-28

This is in your face, Oh my God I can't believe that just happened, Horror.  Good Horror.<br />The story is both involving and intriguing as well as extremely heart wrenching.  Also, it's undeniably gross.  A Lovecraftian tale of the less subtle variety; of things existing just beyond the threshold of our reality and the next.<br />An unspeakable horror, capable of reducing a human to an amorphous pile of gore and bones in seconds.  A creature that endows men with the power to control the thoughts, and actions, of others.  A creature that thrives on the darkest perversions.  A creature that hungers to be very much a part of our world.<br />You will be amazed.  You will be shocked.  Your eyes will bulge, your gorge will rise.<br />The talent of John Shirley is apparent here.  This was the first piece of writing I had ever read by the author (except for the lyrics on Blue Oyster Cult's album Heaven Forbid) and now I can't wait to read more of this demented man's work.<br />A word of warning to the faint of heart: Wetbones is what some might call Splatter Horror.  It bears all the subtlety of an upside down crucifixion.  So pregnant women, people with heart conditions, and those with weak stomachs, proceed with caution.  But by all means proceed.<br />Don't let the numerous typographical errors sway your judgement either, this is a damn fine example of Horror fiction, even if the editor assigned to it was a complete idiot.	2001-01-28

Thomas Harris's scare tactics of dropping us into the minds of the demented still resound fresh and induce mind bending chills.  In this tale an FBI agent, reluctant to come back to the bureau after his near fatal capture of one Hannibal Lecter, must overcome his fear once again to pursue yet another psychological anomoly, a new serial killer dubbed the &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; for his penchant for gnawing on his victims.  The tactics used by agent Will Graham in his earlier successes: think like the killer.  An unnerving story unfolds, intense and extremely convincing.  You never doubt Thomas Harris's skill with this book, in fact you are subdued into awe as you shiver with each page.  Will Graham's pursuits force him to consult the very man who provoked his retirement: Dr. Lecter himself.  But Graham isn't the only one corresponding with the doc, the &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; is Dr. Lecter's own number one fan.  The &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; it seems, doesn't enjoy his media-dubbed moniker, he much prefers the title of &quot;Red Dragon&quot;.  And he forces it's recognition.<br />This novel will knock your socks off, a superior example of what psychological fiction should be.  If you aren't terrified by what you read in this book, you're already insane.  Besides, this is the first &quot;taste&quot; of Hannibal Lecter and aptly whets the appetite for more of this devilish character.  The film version of the book is entitled Manhunter, and stars &quot;the other Hannibal Lecter&quot; but is nevertheless a jarring rendition of this Horror masterpiece.	2001-01-21

Even more so if you have to drive at night.  This story of an inexplicable mist that engulfs a small, New England town has long been a fan favorite and this superb production helps prove why.  The screams and cries of pain are startling, the sound effects make this work incredibly, allowing for a real level of fear to develop.  The voice acting (for the most part) is amazing.  This really isn't an audio book as much as it is audio theater, kinda like the old radio shows.  The Mist is an experience that Stephen King fans ought to know, especially if you have ever read the story.  Also, Frank Darabont (director of The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile)has the movie rights to the story.  And if this cd doesn't whet your appetite for the film adaptation I don't know what will.  A prime example that radio is still a powerful storytelling medium.	2001-01-07

I had never heard of Muriel Gray until I saw the sleek mass market paperback cover of Furnace shouting out at me from the shelves of a local bookstore.  The back seemed intriguing enough to buy and put in my WinterRead pile.  Well, I just finished this book (I started yesterday) and let me just say WOW!  Paced to beat lightning, this book didn't let up until the end!<br />Josh Spiller is a long distance truck driver who happens to take a wrong turn into a very sinister Virginia town.  A town by the name of Furnace.  While attempting to find his way out of the town a strange looking woman pushes a baby filled stroller under Josh's big rig.  When Josh stops, dumbfounded and horrified by what has just happened the woman is nowhere to be seen, unfortunately the remains of the baby are.  Josh is quickly absolved form any wrongdoing and shaken, he's back on the road.  But this time, it's the road to Hell.<br />This story has all the elements of a classic Horror tale.  The small town that keeps sinister secrets.  Monsters both human and some worse.  Dark rituals.  Rich characterization.  Action packed sequences that terrify and make you continue to read with white-knuckled tension.  Don't start reading this at night if you have to work in the morning, you might miss out on some sleep!  Muriel Gray earned herself a fan with this one.  Note:  the author is apparently from Scotland and you might note some British spellings of words, but don't worry, Mrs. Gray's knowledge of America never comes into question.  I sincerely hope the front cover of the book isn't lying and that we can expect Furnace to be coming to movie screens soon.  Definitely cinematic.  I'm also looking forward to reading Muriel Gray's first Horror novel, Trickster.<br />A great, fun read for Horror fans and Action fans alike.  Three Days Alive Permitted.	2000-11-14

Dracula is a masterpiece of Horror fiction, undoubtedly a classic and a necessary read for anyone who would consider him/herself a Horror fan.  The title character has been forever imprinted on the minds of the world as the true name of the Vampire, and almost anyone who you could possibly ask could give you a pretty good description of the framework of the story.<br />A rich, reclusive count from the dark land of Transylvania tires of his homeland and searches for a home abroad to quench his thirst.  Not for riches, not for glory, but for blood.  For this count is a member of the damned breed, the Nosferatu, the Vampire.  A demon condemned to live off of the blood of the living, while being neither alive, nor dead.  It is a sad and frightening tale, filled with action and suspense.<br />Dracula is not only famous for its introduction of the mythology of Vlad the Impaler (in somewhat diluted form) to Western culture, but also for its formula.  The inescapable evil (Dracula) to be confronted by a small, yet wary band of people lead by one who knows all of the creature's secrets and weaknesses (Van Helsing) has become a Horror staple.  And folks never seem to get tired of it.  The subject of Van Helsing, a character who almost, but not quite, overshadows Dracula in popularity is long overdue for a novelization of his own.  Van Helsing's encounters with the supernatural would most definitely draw a fanbase.<br />If you're a Horror fan, or just like good old storytelling, Dracula is a book not to be missed.  In fact, this novel should be required reading.  It just might help increase the literacy rate!<br />Note: this edition has an awesome cover drawn by Boris Vallejo and it claims to be unabridged (abridging this story ought to be illegal!)	2000-11-14

Spooky, and full of atmosphere and as much a part of the American experience as Apple Pie, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow is a true American classic that should be required reading in early highschool.  A must read for Halloween time or if you ever plan a trip to upstate New York!  So if you ever walk the backroads at night and you hear something unknown approaching, just take a guess as to what it is.  It might just be the Headless Horseman!	2000-11-12

I purchased this book after reading my copy of the first Short and Shivery to tatters when I was young enough to go away to summer camp.  This sequel continues the creepy tradition started by Mr. San Souci in the first book.  Taking stories from around the world and re-telling them in a kid friendly format (with just enough scare factor to raise the hackles on any kid at camp) this sequel is just as good as the first book.  Stand out stories in this volume are:<br />Windigo Island<br />The Rolling Head<br />The Croglin Grange Vampire<br />&quot;Me, Myself&quot;<br />The Accursed House<br />and<br />The Thing in the Woods<br />Another fine jaunt into introductory folklore for kids.	2000-11-12

I wanted to read this book for a long time, being a fan of the old Disney movie growing up.  The first thing I noticed was how much bloodier the book is.  The outdated mentality of shooting something because you don't know what it is was at first, appaling, until I allowed myself to remember when this tale was written.  The story was put to the page long before animal rights activisim or Political correctness were a way of life.  Written in the very infancy of Science this book has a pretty enlightened approach, which might make it difficult for younger readers, as well as the outdated language.  The action scenes were vivid in their detail and I truly felt like I was part of the action.  Everything you might want to know about surviving on a lush, tropical, deserted isle that is fortified with just about every imaginable food source (pretty convenient, eh?) can be found in this book.  Danger galore, action to the extreme.  Just don't expect pirates or tigers in pits!  This is what the Disney movie was based on, and after reading this you'll see where the film took some major liberites with its source material.  A fun, historical literary excursion, but not for the squeamish!	2000-11-12

I must admit that Mr. Huggins style is immediately immersive, the pacing lightning fast.  I was at first intrigued by the fearless tracker Nathaniel Hunter and his huge wolf Ghost.  The action was intense and bloody, the weaponry and the tracking information extensive.  But then the story got repetitive.  Which made me feel kind of cheated.  Overall I enjoyed this novel and the trek across Alaska to kill an enemy that seemed impossible to kill.  But the suspense level really wasn't all that high, I had a pretty good idea how this book was gonna turn out.  Some of the twists were slightly unexpected, the characters were well developed (especially Hunter and Ghost) and the monster was a true vision of Horror.  However, I do have a major problem with characters being thrown into the same situation again and again, only to prevail and fight another day and blah blah blah.  The story kept building up to the same climatic scene over and over, just in a different way with a higher and higher body count.  It kinda made me question the intelligence level of the elite special forces unit sent to track the creature.  But, taken for what it is, an action novel, Hunter does deliver the brainless goods.  I must admit I had fun reading this and I daresay, if you're an action fan, you'll enjoy this fast paced book too.  You just might get a little irritated toward the end.  Overall, a good, quick read, that you will strangely recommend to friends.	2000-11-12

Purely an impulse purchase I was somewhat intrigued by the synopsis on the back and figured &quot;what the heck?&quot; and so I dropped my 7 bucks thinking I'd be putting this on my bookshelf afterward, only to let it fall into the haze of forgotten, impulse reads.  Little did I know that I would be recommending this book to friends and family alike.  Sure it's a little bit on the unbelievable side (ok, it's almost entirely unbelievable) but the characterization, the action, and the sub-plotting were enough to make me read this book straight through in one white knuckled sitting!<br />A world untouched, deep beneath the Antarctic continent, filled with riches beyond your wildest dreams.  And an unseen danger, hidden for eons that may be the very doom of humanity!  Secret military installations, extreme gadgetry, an awesome monster(s), and twist after twist make Subterranean perfect reading for adventure fans.  Full of action and with nary a slow moment in its 410 page frame this book is perfect for those who like their stories Adrenaline filled!  So if you're looking for a conglomeration of about every action movie ever made (with just about every possible element for the genre) pick this book up and allow yourself a guilty, non-thinking pleasure!	2000-11-12

This book is one of those books that must be read to be explained, it's that good.  Part Horror, part Dark Fantasy Strangewood is the story of a writer's creation come to disturbing, very real life.  When Thomas Randall's son falls prey to an inexplicable coma he finds that his son has been taken (well, in spirit, I guess) to the &quot;fictional&quot; world of Strangewood.  A world that is supposed to be a figment of Thomas Randall's imagination.  But Strangewood is real.  Strangewood is at war.  Strangewood is dying.  And only Randall can save this world from collapse.  Only Randall can save his son from a fate worse than death.<br />The idea of a writer having to face the very reality of his/her creation has been done before, but in Strangewood the story is so expertly crafted, the characters so startling in their vibrancy that you forget the idea that the plot has been done before.  Because in this case it hasn't.  The world of Strangewood (and its inhabitants) would itself make a very entertaining fantasy series (and in case you haven't heard of Harry Potter there is a market for this).  Christopher Golden's talent is excruciatingly apparent in this novel and while I read this I kept thinking to myself &quot;man, this is a fun read&quot; which it was.  Probably one of the most memorable and enjoyable reads of 1999 and a book I can't recommend enough.  For fans of Horror or Dark Fantasy this is a book for you!	2000-11-12

Memories of childhood, of inspirations to write, and even some method to the madness fill this book; making it feel like a cross the table conversation.  Discussing influential books and authors, films and directors, and pertinent world events, King implores his fans to pay attention to the world around them, citing that as the writer's best source of material.  Friendly advice from the world's best selling author for the price of a paperback!  You can't beat that!  If you don't own this book immediately purchase a copy.<br />Also included are two appendixes, one for films and one for books that make great to watch/ to read lists.  Many of the books and films suggested are out of print or have moratorium status, which will prompt a treasure hunt for avid fans.  The only fault with this book is that Mr. King hasn't updated it or written a sequel since the book is almost twenty years old!  An inspiring and informative book.	2000-10-21

The Drive-In and its sequel, The Drive-In 2 are both extremely strange tales that border on absurdity and lunacy  with equal measure.  Joe Lansdale writes things that require an extreme ability to suspend disbelief and if you read these two novels you will happily comply with his wishes.  A jam packed Texas drive in, showing an all night horror film festival, is suddenly dropped off the face of reality when a smiling comet flies overhead.  At first it's just weird and then it gets scary as survival instinct kicks in for those stuck inside the drive in.  And then it gets weird again...  This two-for-one edition is a nice way to experience a truly talented and imaginative writer's take on human nature under the worst of circumstances.  The book(s) are even better if you're a fan of slasher films and really gross scene description in Horror novels.

This book, and its two sequels, were the hottest books around when I was in elementary school.  Scary stories with even scarier illustrations that are still haunting (I'm 20 at this writing) today.  The stories, retold by a masterful Alvin Schwartz in a kid friendly format provided me with more than one nightmare as a child.  And I loved every terror filled second!  The 29 macabre stories, poems, and songs are a great introduction to the Horror genre for young readers that will have them literally screaming for more!  The incredibly dark and startling illustrations by Stephen Gammell are just as, if not more memorable than the stories themselves.  Especially for &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;The Haunted House&quot;, &quot;Wait Till Martin Comes&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost With the Bloody Fingers&quot;.

The terror is all too real (ask anyone who has kids what their worst fear is).  King mixes real life tragedy with the supernatural so well in this book that upon finishing the novel you gasp for breath and then shudder, not with fear but with satisfaction.  This is one damn fine novel, scary and just the right length.  You'll find no filler here, just one hell of a Horror novel involving ghosts, indian burial grounds, the wendigo, and things best left as they are.  Another strong aspect of this novel is the characterization.  Probably some of the most memorable and loveable characters in any Stephen King novel.  The Creed family is just right, all-American, semi-dysfunctional, with very real problems and emotions.  Jud Crandall, the kindly next door neighbor is standout.  His appearances aren't overbearing and his character moves the story along nicely.  The characters are people we all know and people we'd all like to meet.<br />The supernatural elements of this novel are great, the characters superb, and the story is moving and terrifying.  Quite possibly Mr. King's darkest work, Pet Sematary is a novel not to be missed.  The very definition of a page turner!	2000-10-03

His story of loss and  insanity has more to do with social apathy on the part of his environment, which makes him altogether that much more sympathetic.  You can't blame him for the things he does, as each act no matter how surprising or atrocious is a direct consequence for a wrong done to him.  So whether it's stealing comic books or making a pig out of mean old Mrs. Nugent you'll find yourself laughing at Mr. Francie Brady Not A Bad Bastard Anymore.  The flow of this novel is the only difficult part, as it is very much like being dropped into a young boy's stream of consciousness.  A lack of punctuation throughout was a brilliant tactic by Mr. McCabe to illustrate the rationalization of the insanity that first surrounds young Francie Brady and then eventually engulfs him.  A thought provoking tale on the importance of a stable upbringing and a solid establishment of reality for children.  This novel was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award and was made into a fine film by Neil Jordan(The Crying Game, Interview with the Vampire).  A solid investment for fans of compelling literature and a billion, trillion Flash bars.	2000-10-03

And now successful horror author David Masters is moving in, for inspiration and to experience whatever the house can throw at him.  But nothing can prepare him for the evil that lies waiting to regain power and walk again in the living flesh.  Ghosts and Gore abound, with a heavy dosage of eroticism (both real and spirit related) that make Tamara Thorne's novel a terrifying treat.  The story is well told, with excellent characters throughout.  Nothing about this novel seems forced and the action is fast paced and intense.  So if you're a fan of Ghosts or Haunted House stories pick this book up, wait until it's dark out to start reading and be prepared to question every creaking floorboard in your own house.

The story of a town,  slaughtered by an unknown force is one of the scariest I have ever read!  The Ancient Enemy gives credence to every possible fear.  The creepiest  part of the book isn't in the action the readers experience, but thinking  about what it must have been like for the helpless citizens of Snowfield  during the couple of days they fought the indescribable horrors that came  for them in what was once the safety of their homes!  The description of  the corpses that are found by the band of remaining living is done in  typical Koontz fashion, that in the squeamish would induce a flow of vomit  and in the mind of an adolescent boy a hearty cry of &quot;Damn, that's  cool!&quot;  Well, since I was the latter and have never been the former  when I read this I must say that this is one cool novel.  Almost impossible  to put down once you've started reading, the action is so unrelenting.  And  you actually care about the characters.  Now be forewarned, the movie made  from this book is disappointing in comparison.  But it's not a total loss,  so read the book first, allow your shivers from reading to subside and then  go RENT the movie.

After reading so many positive reviews of this book my expectations for a  truly special fantasy novel, on par with The Dark Tower series, were pretty  high.  That's what I get for having high expectations!  Now, admittedly  this novel is pretty enjoyable.  But &quot;classic&quot;?  Not hardly.  I  am a pretty big Stephen King fan but this is not one of his best stories.  So utterly predictable, I was rooting for Flagg just to have a twist ending  or something!  But it read like a childrens fairy tale, and a pretty mild  one at that.  Maybe it's the packaging that threw me but I was expecting a  little something closer to an adult novel here.  And that is not what you  get.  The Harry Potter books are more explicit in their depiction of  violence.  The best parts were the evil schemings of Flagg (and the  understanding that this is one incarnation of Randall Flagg, from The  Stand), especially the Dragon Sand and the death it brought its victims,  still that came across as mediocre at best.  What would have saved this,  and put it in the category of &quot;classic&quot;, would have been more  than one dragon playing a role.  Bottom line, if you're a Stephen King fan  take this one for a whirl, as I recommend reading all of his works, just to  know them.  But don't expect anything more than to be slightly entertained  by this children's tale.  Now if they'd promote it as such, maybe I'd have  a higher opinion of it.	2000-08-22

Johnny, Fergie, and Professor Childermass are back and it seems the cantankerous old coot has something special in his basement.  A time  machine!  Well, actually a Time Trolley!  When Johnny and Fergie notice the  Professor acting strange they decide to investigate, instead of finding the  Prof one step closer to insanity they find that he has an honest-to-God  time machine that allows him to travel to Constantinople right before its  fall to the Turks!  The Professor has a hair-brained, but well intentioned  scheme to alter the course of history (and save more than a few helpless  souls) but alas, things do not always go according to plan.<br />With grand,  Bellairsian style the inseparable trio come across ghosts, statue  guardians, Turkish hordes, and a really cool thingamajig that allows them  to fly only by uttering a few simple words.  With any John Bellairs book  you know you're in for a treat, and although The Trolley to Yesterday is  amongst some of the master author's lighter works it never fails to  entertain.  So if you're a fan of the fantastic hop aboard The Trolley to  Yesterday!	2000-08-22

After reading Steve Alten's &quot;Meg&quot; I got into a sort of shark  frenzy, and when I heard there was another book out there with the same  subject matter I immediately purchased it on that premise alone.  Charles  Wilson's Extinct takes a much more serious approach, although slower paced.  Also the design of the Megalodon here is a tad bit more plausible, and a  hell of a lot bigger than the one found in Alten's book!  The ending was  great, no matter what you've heard.  For fans of Jaws, Meg, Deep Blue Sea  and any other sea creature book or movie out there here's another one to  add to your list.  And remember, if something bumps you while swimming in  the ocean you never know what it might be...!	2000-08-21

I saw and loved the movie way before I read the book, and although much different from the movie I must say, the book is just as entertaining and  just as good!  As with any book that is later turned into a movie there is  much more going on within the pages than in the eventual script.  Full of  in depth characters, detailed action sequences, and a higher death toll Mr.  Preston and Mr. Child know how to write a humdinger of a novel!  And the  monster, well that's what it's all about!  The features of the monster and  cunning it uses to kill its prey are genius!  I recommend this book highly  to anyone who likes Action, Horror, or Science Fiction novels.  But if you  watch the movie be forewarned, approach it as a separate entity and you'll  enjoy it, watch it with the expectation of accurate re-enactment of the  novel and you will be sorely disappointed!  If you read this book you'll be  hooked on Lincoln/Child collaborations and you'll seek each and every one  out!	2000-08-21

When nazi troops stationed at a remote Keep in Romania start dying horribly, one for each  night, their commander sends a message to High Command stating  &quot;something is murdering my men&quot;.  An SS squad is sent to stop the  problem, their commander convinced partisan activity is to blame.  But no  mortal can be attributed to the continued demise of troops.  Suspicion of  the supernatural at work brings the nazis to enlist the aid of an ailing  history and folklore professor, who happens to be a Jew.  Meanwhile, a  mysterious stranger has started a journey to confront the evil in the Keep  once again...<br />This novel is extremely entertaining, the death scenes  are explicit, the terror truly felt.  The explanation of the evil entity is  intriguing in premise.  The characters are written in animated style,  solid, and never shallow.  When reading this I felt like I was there, which  really added to the fear factor.  Definitely a classic horror tale,  atlhough requires a high level ability to suspend disbelief.	2000-08-10

This novel definitely deserves its Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel  in Horror.  A fast paced, bloody read with characters developed way beyond  your average horror fare.  The witches/monsters were written in vicious  cinematic action sequences that scream MOVIE (apparently if you believe the  back of the book, this is already in progress).  My only complaint here was  the somewhat predictable ending, but I guess that's what people want.  A  very nice twist on what BAD witches really are.  The character of Wendy  really stands out, kind of a cross between Glenda, Good Witch of the North  and Dr. Van Helsing.  Her character was developed to the point where she  felt almost like a long lost sister.  A weird one, but a sister  nonetheless.  This is an excellent horror novel that flirts very close with  &quot;Classic&quot; status.  Any tale that takes a small, New England town,  witchcraft, monsters, and throws it against the backdrop of approaching  Halloween deserves to be read.  Especially if you claim to be a Horror fan.  Check this book out and find out what witches really look like, and how  they can fly without broomsticks!	2000-08-03

Five complete strangers from different corners of the U.S. have similar erotic, violent dreams.  Supernatural occurences plague  each character's hometown.  The only connection, unbeknownst to them, is  the houses of their childhood, which somehow is the same for each.  A large  house, ominouse and forboding...<br />This was a pretty good, original spin on  the haunted house tale.  Bentley Little knows how to write a fast paced,  gore filled story that screams of B-movie.  The house and everything else  supernatural had a Lovecraftian quality and every action sequence was aptly  detailed in Little's trademark, unflinching way.  This book reminded me  somewhat of William Hope Hodgson's &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot;  which is also a great read.  The use of dolls was a nice, creepy touch,  especially when used as a murder weapon.  Grisly, original death scenes  kept the story moving.  The only snags were in characters lacking dimension  (which, in some way, is good) that may annoy readers.  This is horror as it  is meant to be, laughable, offensive, disturbing, under no circumstances to  be taken seriously.  The ending wasn't as good as I would have liked, but  overall I was entertained.  For serious horror fans only.	2000-08-01

What I mean by the cheese analogy is that many of the plot twists don't fit, don't make sense, and make it seem that something is missing.  Kinda like  watching a B-horror movie.  But I like cheese, especially this kind.  Laymon has written a fast paced, enjoyable novel about a small California  town plagued by black rain.  Rain that for some unknown reason turns those  who touch it into raving, murderous lunatics.  Horrific events follow,  ranging from stabbings, shootings, cannibalism, and rape.  When I was  reading I kept thinking of this as Night of the Living Drenched, as those  affected by the rain have no real control over their actions.  But they do  know what they're doing.  That in itself was frightening.  But this book  really relies more on the gross out factor than all out fear. Which will  probably turn off some readers. My only complaint was the entirely  predicatable ending, but that does add to the B-movie campiness. All in all  if you like horror novels check this one out, you won't regret it.  And you  will invest in a raincoat and umbrella!	2000-08-01

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a magnificent tale that lives up to its hype ten fold.  J.K. Rowling's world within a world, where witches and warlocks (as well as many more so called mythological creatures) live  secretly amongst humans (or Muggles) is great fantastic reading for child  and adult alike.  Granted this is geared toward children no younger than  nine years old, it shouldn't be too scary or thematic for any child if read  to by a charismatic parent(especially one who does voices!).  Whether it be  letters delivered via owl, an invisibility cloak, or the ever present  promise of adventure Harry Potter is a wild, exciting ride into juvenille  literature that has started an explosion of children desiring to read.  And  this is definitely a well written story to encourage a child to read.  Harry Potter is fast becoming a literary icon and with good reason; the  character is so likeable that anyone reading of his exploits can't help but  cringe when he's in danger and smile with the very notion that somwhere a  Hogwarts exists and that within its walls resides an eager pupil by the  name of Harry Potter!  The rightful heir to Narnia or Oz, the Harry Potter  series is superb reading!  If you haven't read it yet what are you waiting  for?	2000-07-16

Extremely groundbreaking in the use of a pathology for the killer, it seems that Norman Bates is as much a household name in American  culture as Ronald McDonald.  The Alfred Hitchcock film version seems to  have used the book for the script, with only minor deviations.  A short  read, it's impossible not to finish this in one sitting.  While reading I  took down four pages of quotations from this book, it's that good and  inspiring.  I do think this book could have been longer and bloodier  provided it had been written 10-15 years later.  The ending was great and  overall the book was awesome.  Reading it was like watching the Hitchcock  version of the movie, and vice versa.  A must read Horror novel.  On a  scale from 1-10 I'd rate this novel a 10, for its historical significance,  the intensity of the story, the quote factor, and characterization.<br />Come on, everyone knows Norman Bates!	2000-06-15

This was the first book of Richard Laymon's that I read, and if all his books are like this he's just earned himself another fan.  The use of explicit violence and sex was so different from what most mainstream writers will allow (or be allowed, grrr, editors) in their books.  The  unabashed approach to horror and the use of rape (which is pretty high up  there on my list of fears) is something not usually found in mainstream  Horror.  I can only think of one other author to pull out all the stops  like this and that would have to be Bentley Little.<br />The way Laymon makes  humans out to be more terrifying monsters than anything supernatural was  great.  Reading this was like watching some B-grade horror flick and I  loved it.  This book was near impossible to put down, I had to force myself  to get some sleep. A highly original vampire tale that is not for the  weak-stomached.  I am definitely looking forward to reading more of Richard  Laymon's work in the future, and if you take this book for a spin you will  too.	2000-06-15

Seemingly inappropriate, always bizarre, Mr. Gorey walked the taboo tightrope in his stories and illustrations. Here are fifteen such delightfully atrocious tales, compiled for the convenience of his very demented fans (including yours truly).<br />First is \\"The Unstrung Harp\\" about a befuddled and (in appearance) paranoid writer who trudges through his maddening existence, as so many a writer inevitably will. The casual reader might find this tale odd, but anyone who has ever taken to writing seriously will feel nothing but empathy. Has one of the greatest ending lines of any story I've ever read.<br />Next is \\"The Listing Attic\\", a series of devilish ryhmes with correlating illustrations. Many of these are horrible in design yet strangely you'll find yourself laughing at the unfortunate mishaps that fall upon the characters.<br />Now, on to \\"The Doubtful Guest\\" about a mysterious penguin-like creature that arrives at a residence only to act in a seemingly irrational way, doing things for inexplicable reasons. Personally I think this is nothing more than a metaphor for the unexpected in life and how it's more irrational for people to waste time trying to make sense out of these things. But that's just me.<br />\\"The Object Lesson\\" is just plain confusing, as if Mr. Gorey was just penning random thoughts and then illustrating them. Definitely weird.<br />\\"The Bug Book\\" is pretty childish in design and, to me, not particuarly noteworthy.<br />\\"The Fatal Lozenge\\" is another series of ryhmes, although the level of morbidity and violence is pretty much maxed out. Reading these you won't find yourself able to laugh, only maybe able to produce a nervous twitter as you ponder how very real these situations could be.<br />\\"The Hapless Child\\" is nothing short of a masterpiece, evoking every emotion from love to terror this tragedy should have a place in American high school curriculum, but alas public education systems in this nation would rather not deal with horrible reality.<br />\\"The Curious Sofa\\" is an attack on preconceived notions of sexual morality, being pornographic only in suggestion the point is that if someone who considered him/herself to be in the right in his/her sexual ideals he/she wouldn't understand the innuendo of the words and illustrations. A very interesting piece.<br />\\"The Willowdale Handcar\\" is a story I didn't like.<br />\\"The Gashlycrumb Tinies\\" has to be my favorite Edward Gorey piece, a sinister telling of the Alphabet with a small child meeting its demise for each letter, kind of an anti-Alligators All Around. I have a separate review posted for this story as it is deserving of the title of literature.<br />\\"The Insect God\\" is another disturbing work involving intelligent, and apparently religious, giant sized bugs.<br />\\"The West Wing\\" is a series of illustrations that force the reader to create his/her own captions for what is depicted.<br />\\"The Wuggly Ump\\" is a silly song about a very hungry monster.<br />\\"The Sinking Spell\\" is another tale of an unexpected visitor, a creature on an indecipherable journey.<br />Last, is \\"The Remembered Visit\\" about a woman who can't forget the odd travels of her youth or her meeting of a once famous man.<br />That's it, the coffee table book to beat all coffee table books, the ultimate conversation piece. But, then again, everything Edward Gorey did was worthy of conversation.would rather not deal with horrible reality.<br />\\"The Curious Sofa\\" is an attack on preconceived notions of sexual morality, being pornographic only in suggestion the point is that if someone who considered him/herself to be in the right in his/her sexual ideals he/she wouldn't understand the innuendo of the words and illustrations.

It took me awhile to get through because of the slow atmospheric pacing (which seems a Straub trademark), the novel won't let you read fast.  The small  town setting, the harsh winter, and New England feel was close to perfect.  The characters were likeable, and when they met with misfortune I found I  cared.  That's a rarity amongst Horror novels.  The supernatural creature  (self-proclaimed Manitou) is well crafted, although it doesn't really  instill fear as much as dread.  The sadistic pleasure that the creature has  in ruining lives under different guises was the scariest part of this  novel.  The extreme patience of a true predator, that was what made for  instances of terror.  Knowing that the characters couldn't escape, even in  their dreams, that's what makes this book so great.  This felt like reading  a John Bellairs novel if he had written one for adults.  That was a big  plus.  The overall way in which this novel worked was just amazing,  definitely the work of a master storyteller.  Even though it took me awhile  I never felt like I was just trudging through.  On a scale from 1-10 I  would rate this novel a 10 for its importance to the genre of Horror, for  the style and craftsmanship of the story, the complexity of the tale, use  of atmosphere, the way it just makes you want to go out and recommend it to  friends, how it reminded me of reading John Bellairs, and because it's that  damn good!

This story of eight Halloween costumed lads and their journey through land and time in search of a friend is perfect for the holiday, as it not only entertains but educates as well.  Whether it be Celtic customs of old or a  skull shaped cookie in Mexico for Dia de Los Muertes through this tale  young readers can understand that Halloween is not, nor has it always been,  just celebrated with candy and masks.  Bradbury allows for the  overshadowing of death to linger but not suffocate (which would scare  children) and so doing correlates the celebration of the harvest with the  end of life.  He then deftly clarifies that this celebration of the end of  life reaffirms the prospect of living itself, and that there is nothing  demonic in that.  I would recommend this for more intermediate readers  (8-12) as many of the ideas and descriptions would quite possible be too  much for a child younger than that.  But whether you're 8 or 80 this tale  will intrigue and entertain.  Nearly perfect.  So wait 'til the leaves  start to turn, settle down with a nice mug of hot cider by a roaring fire,  and allow Mr. Bradbury to take you to The Halloween Tree.	2000-06-15

I'm not a parent myself but I do have a younger sister for  whom this book was purchased.  At eight years old it's sometimes difficult  to divert her attention away from the cartoons on TV.  But all I have to  say is &quot;Wanna make a concoction?&quot; and BAMM!  that TV is off!  Another warning, the creation process can be highly affecting, extremely  messy, and always fun!  Also, although this is ideal for days where  boredom is induced by being forced inside (ie. rain or snow) many of the  concoctions are for outside use.  Such as the Super Sidewalk Paint (really  cool), Worlds Best Bubbles (make em big and last long too!), Water Balloon  Yo-Yo (kinda self-explanatory), and of course Sidewalk Chalk.  But the  majority of the concoctions are for indoor or outdoor use (I really like  the Gooey Gunk, kinda like the slime you used to be able to buy in the  quarter prize machines at the grocery store).  Bottom line this book with  it's fun recipes and illustrations (so the kids can see what it is they'll  be making) is almost essential for any parent.  The only thing better is  that your kids read a book on a rainy day, but that can only last so long.  The activities will wipe away the boredom faster than you can say  &quot;Gooey Gunk&quot;!

This is a fast paced, action driven novel that doesn't allow the reader to stop until the very end.  Written (according to Michael Crichton) on a dare from a colleauge to modernize and make exciting the tale of Beowulf, the classic epic poem that apparently is difficult for some college students to understand.  An arab, somewhat exiled from Bagdhad (sexual indescretion to  blame) into the mysterious North Lands, home of the Vikings.  In the novel  this man communicates with these Norsemen through a translator and a member  of the Viking group who speaks some Latin. In the horrible movie (which I  awaited with high expectations) Ibn (the arab protagonist) needs no  translator since he can learn the Viking dialect simply by watching and  listening to the Viking's around a campfire!  The movie is laughable at  best, which is strange because the novel is perfect for film.  The novel is  much more informative, but not, as many of the various editions of this  novel have touted, a true story.  The action and story are entirely  speculative, entirely fiction.  But the fantastic quest and fights between  the grendel is some of Crichton's most entertaining writing ever.  This is  more of a short fantasy novel.  But fun reading nonetheless.  For Crichton  fans and fiction fans in general don't miss this book, but whatever you do  don't see the movie!	2000-04-27

Ray Bradbury's name is synonymous with imagination and in this collection of short stories he proves that beyond a reasonable doubt.  I know, I used to cringe at his name.  That is before I learned that he didn't just write science fiction (a genre of which I am not too fond).  These stories range  from a bizarre account of one couple's visit to a Mexican town and the  mummies that reside there (The Next In Line), a loyal dog that brings its  young  bed-ridden owner things from out in the world, even things from  cemeteries (The Emissary), a baby born with an evil intelligence (The Small  Assassin), a man who is the heir to Death's job (The Scythe), and an  observant boy who deals with a tenant vampire in a very unique way (The Man  Upstairs).  The stories I have listed are of particualr impact and my  favorites of the collection, but overall word for word, page for page each  story is priceless.  If you are a fan of horror fiction or just plain old  imaginative writing in general invest in the works of Ray Bradbury, you  won't regret it.	2000-04-27

Everyone loved the story and the illustrations were pretty good.  But the next day at class our teacher wasn't there!  In her place was a strange woman.  Now, if you know anything about kids you understand that they can  run on a wolf pack mentality, especially when it comes to substitutes.  Under normal circumstances we would have pushed this stranger, this  substitute, to the brink of insanity.  Sure, we'd have had some casualties  headed for the principal's office, but a substitue was an opportunity not  to be missed.  That is, unless she looked like Miss Viola Swamp!<br />  And  boy did this woman ever fit the bill!  I can't recall ever seeing a group  of second graders so attentive to the day's lesson, so well behaved!  Now,  the substitute wasn't all that bad, just not as nice as the actual teacher.  But we all had Miss Nelson is Missing on our minds and everyone of us kept  thinking &quot;What if...?&quot;<br />  I'm just guessing here, but I do  believe my second grade teacher knew the affect this book would have on us.  She knew we would pay attention in her absence and upon her return great  her with enthusiasm and relief.  She was right!  Now anyone even thinking  about becoming an early Elementary School teacher should think well on  investing in this book.

This story about a young boy stranded in the Canadian wilderness will never lose it's affect on me.  Being a child of divorce I can totally empathize with Brian's struggles to cope.  And I appreciate Gary Paulsen's comparing that struggle with actual survival.  But this book is in no way a  sermon on how to deal with divorce.  It's about learning to co-exist, and  to overcome any obstacles.  The descriptions of how Brian went about  ensuring his survival, only with the use of his hatchet (hence the title)  were awe inspiring when a pre-teen and the book still retains a sentimental  hold over my heart as an adult.  the encounters with wildlife range from  comical to downright horrifying.  Hatchet made me appreciate the things I  had and also allowed me to realize that I shouldn't seek too hard the  things I desired to have but didn't.  Overall this is a great book to give  your 10-13 year old, a book about respect for nature, appreciation for  life, and above all understanding that you can make it through the  toughtest of situations as long as you have the right tools and are willing  to learn how to use them.	2000-04-25

This is the first in Stephen King's Dark Tower series and right away it pulls the reader into the desolate landscape of an Alter-Earth, where similarities between our world are noted and the differences are savored  (and cringed at).  Comparable to Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series  (although definitely intended for a much older and mature audience)this  involves one man's quest for a Dark Tower (which presumably could save his  dying world), a man that is a cross between a knight and an American West  gunfighter (hence the title).  In this he is following a &quot;man in  black&quot; who may have answers he so desperately needs.  This is  entertaining reading at its best, adventure, intrigue, a must for any fan  of Stephen King.  I'm not that big of a fantasy novel fan but this book and  it's sequels are excellent motivators to peruse that genre.  Bottom line,  if you're looking for some fun while reading check this book out.  If you  do you'll not only finish this book but you'll find yourself going right  for the next one, until you find yourself waiting (rather patiently I might  add) for Mr. King to put out another one of these tightly woven, highly  interesting stories!	2000-04-23

King puts an ocean of imagery in his books and this one is no exception.  The characters (alive and dead) are colorful, believable, likeable, and each fills his or her own niche  quite well.  It was impossible not to compare the protagonist, Mike Noonan,  to King himself.  In light of King's recent accident the book is eerie in  how prophetic it seems to be (writer's block, fear of being hit on a Maine  road, with a dangerous curve, in summer).  The ghosts are actual spirits of  the dead, not psychic emanations, and I liked that aspect a whole lot.  The  malicious happenings a result of spectral rage and revenge.  The &quot;real  world&quot; violence is believable and tragic.  The ending wasn't overly  happy and I was thankful for that.  Horror novels shouldn't end happily in  my opinion.  The pacing was fast and I hadn't read the story before.  For  some reason, King's use of the small Maine town with devious inhabitants  hasn't grown old.  His semi-return to Castle Rock and the various  mentioning of its denizens was actually quite a treat.  Of course you'd  have to be a King fan to appreciate them.  The blending of the supernatural  with the &quot;real world&quot; was deftly accomplished with a master's  skill.  King fans read it and enjoy.  If you haven't read King before start  at the beginning and work your way up.	2000-02-22

He puts you right in his head and it is a wonderful place.  With this book I became a fan of Bradbury's work.  Apparently  originally meant to be a short story entitled Dark Carnival Bradbury turned  this into one of the scariest novels ever written.  I'm not kidding folks.  Under the guise of a children's tale is a story of a circus of bad  intentions, a seller of lightning rods, an evil merry-go-round, and the  terror of being a teenager.  Highly original and entertaining.  If you are  a fan of horror fiction or just plain old good story telling pick this book  up and enjoy.	2000-02-15

Some of the flashbacks could have done with a little more work on their transitions but overall I didn't care.  The way Piccirilli writes is pretty damn fresh, and the integration of occult ideas was woven into one hell of  a tapestry.  But I do think if a reader doesn't have much interest in the  occult (or much knowledge of it) then that reader will be kinda lost.  But  the action was good and bloody, disturbing scenes do tend to pop up.  And  the ending wasn't a let down.  Horror fans rally around this book.  Occasional horror fans stick to King or Koontz.	2000-02-12

It's been a long time since something truly shocking and so dastardly in design has been plucked from book store shelves.

Sure it's formulaic, sure it reads more like a novella than a novel, but so what?  The most important factor to any book such as this is that it is entertaining.  Brass was that  and much more.  It kinda played out like the blueprint for a monster movie  (I hope it was!)  Really cool death scenes with short, concise text kept  the action moving and all though the reader can pretty much figure out how  this one is going to end it is never disappointing!

It took me all of 3 hours to read because  the pace of this novel wouldn't let me read any slower!  A great monster  book (which, given the right director could make a fantastic monster movie)  that's full of Native American folklore and monster related gore!  This  book was truly cinematic ( I could especially picture the scene with the  cows!) and left me wanting more.

But what do people think when you say his name?  &quot;Oh, he's just too scary for me!&quot;  An unfortunate misconception that keeps many hardcore book  readers away from King's writings.  So here is a story that isn't too scary  that might interest people into checking out his work.  It's a little  sci-fi, a little horror, a little mystery all wrapped up in one big  package!  Stephen King is more of a writer of the sinister, the possibility  of treachery and maddness in each of us.  A true sense of horror, of that  slight jolt of electricity that for a second makes you just want to drop  the book, really wasn't present here.  But there sure were some cool ideas!  The way people pay for new found abilities with the blood of the not-so  innocent was a somewhat humorous twist in this book (all though I did start  to feel kinda weird at some of the stuff I found myself laughing at).  That  is one of Stephen King's greatest achievements in his writing, his ability  to take something that in any real circumstance would be deemed a great and  terrible misfortune and make his audience laugh (maybe more appropriate to  say snicker, somewhat devilishly)at these unexpected turn of events!  For  the most part Mr. King doesn't fail to entertain his massively loyal  audience, and The Tommyknockers is no exception.  If you haven't read it  yet and you are not particularly a Stephen King fan go check it out at your  library, it can't hurt.  If you do call yourself a Stephen King fan and you  haven't read this book yet, well shame on you!	1999-12-18

I loved this book, the storyline was fantastic (although  undeniably a little farfetched) and the action was unrelenting.  A rainy  day and its subsequent boredom can quickly be forgotten while reading this  book.  It plays out like a movie.  Unfortunately it has already been turned  into a terrible one, (alas Mr. Koontz just can't seem to get a good  director for his silver screen translations) that if seen before reading  the book will most likely turn prospective readers away.  Don't heed the  abyssmal warning that the film was, this book is fun to read and it won't  take you all that long to do it.

There really isn't much that serves as a tangible reason for the house being so evil, it just apparently is.  And it's a vicious house for certain, preying on  psychological fear rather than manifesting itself as a poltergiest or  apparition.  Things just &quot;happen&quot; in or around the house,  disturbing things.  Lives are ruined and that is the only motiff that  emerges.  It's not a singular entity with just murder in mind.  It wants to  cause pain to its victims on an inner level and that is extremely  frightening in concept.  The novel is like a constant mind rape of the  characters involved and it is so very delicious in its malice.  One of the  top 10 horror novels I have ever read and way more intense than Shirley  Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House or Richard Matheson's Hell House.  A  must read for any fan of the horror genre or any new home owner.	1999-11-25

The weaving of myth and witchcraft into that intriguing time  period in America when the Atomic bomb was a new thing is just fantastic.  The greatest thing about Mr. Bellairs is that his books can evoke a kind of  &quot;happy fear&quot; in the young readers that will pick up his books and  that his style and stories stick with you forever.  I just can't imagine  growing up without reading his books.  Delightfully scary with great  characters.  And Illustrations by Edward Gorey!

This book was the first book I ever read by Stephen King and that may have something to do with my liking it so much.  It isn't really that scary but it is captivating.  The bi-polarisms of writing are written in thought  provoking, disturbing passages and if you are possesive of any intelect you  will find this funny, yet disturbing (provided you have ever taken writing  seriously).  The dark humor of George Stark and his portrayal of Thad  Beaumont's evil twin is nothing short of fun reading, and although you may  be shocked by his actions you are never really surprised!  &quot;The  sparrows are flying again&quot; is one of those quotable passages from King  (of course &quot;Redrum&quot; will probably keep the crown in that  department) that sticks with you and becomes synonymous with the title of  the book.  I read this book after sneaking it off of my Dad's bookshelf  when I was about 10.  A rebellion for being grounded at the time (don't  ask).  I sat down and read it in about 4 hours.  Maybe it was because it  was something I wasn't supposed to do that I cherish this book and  associate it so well with my pre-adolescence.  Maybe it really is as good  as I think it is.  No matter, my opinion on this book stands as is.  this  is a great book, maybe more aptly described as fantasy suspense than horror  fiction-but it is good.  And one of my neighbors drives one of those  Tornado cars, the kind that Goerge Stark drove.  But this one is green.  But maybe it was painted...  Read this book at all costs if you call  yourself a fan of Stephen King, or if you have ever been just a little  frustrated by the writing process and those unseen forces that seem to be  working against you.	1999-11-25

Some of the reviews before mine have been pretty damn ignorant,  slammming the graphic violence and the character development, and I just  can't figure out what the hell these people were looking for!  If you look  to a book to bring new, profound meaning to your life you need to get out  more, maybe socialize some, it is ok to not read sometimes.  Picking up a  book and trying to analyze while you read is extremely boring and takes  away from the experience and let me just say that graphic violence,  unabashed, does have its place in horror fiction.  There is something about  the things that do evil without any remorse, without any emotion at all.  Evil for evil's sake should always pop up in the so called &quot;fresh  faces&quot; of horror.  You can't think deep all the time, treading through  that water takes too much energy.  Every once in a while you just need a no  brainer that just gives you a kick in the pants, a little sense of the what  ifs, and sets you back on your way.  I doubt this book will change the  course of horror fiction, it certainly isn't subtle in any respect, but you  never know.  I just can't help thinking that the people who said the  intensity of the violence was degrading to the story never saw The Texas  Chainsaw Massacre, or maybe they don't think an educational establishment  would ever be possesive of an evil entity.  Aaah, those lucky Catholic  school kids, so naive.  Bottom line, if you have any liking of Bentley  Little's works and it doesn't take you long to get through books (as in you  can read) you should probably check this out.  If not for the little  instances of guilt certain scenes will stir within you, for thinking those  dirty thoughts.	1999-11-23

This is one of those stories you just have to read to believe, and even then you question it.  It being what was written, how it was written, and the originality of the story.  This is in no way your traditional Vampire  tale, very reminiscent of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead  (although I think this story preceded the movie), except the monsters  possess intelligence.  The feeling of being alone is invasive on the reader  and the whole thing is pulled off with an eerie, dark beauty.  There isn't  a happy ending folks, it is scary, it is a classic rendition of those  fanged demons we all associate with long capes, coffins, and widow's peaks.  It is the demonic offspring of that traditional view.  And you leave the  reading wishing to adopt that ugly child as your own.  Essential reading  for any horror fan.	1999-11-23

Sure, we've all read vampire stories, seen the movies, heard the legends.  But we don't really believe in those archaic old beasts do we?  You bet your eternal soul we do!  This novel was Stephen King's first really good  book (if you haven't read my review of Carrie let me just say I wasn't too  impressed with it) and I would like to believe that this was the work that  really cemented Mr. King in the publication world.  Affirmation that he  wasn't a one hit wonder and such.  If you have ever read Bram Stoker's  Dracula you will undoubtedly notice similarites in the story line but in no  way is this the same as Dracula.  I was not alive when this book was  written, I don't really empathize with certain events; but the overall  novel is timeless.  That is the great argument for Stephen King's works  being literature, he defies the critc's notion that current events become  dated with the passage of time.  There is this little  concept of setting  in stories!  What really gets me with this piece is that the characters  are people we've all met.  Adulterous, Sly, Vindictive, Violent, Evil.  We  all know people like that.  So when you finish the book you think two  things: 1.  They got theirs in the end. 2.  Hey, this is left open as if  the author intended a sequel!<br /><br />No question this book will try to get  under your epidermis, hopefully it will succeed.  Provided you haven't  already been visited by a soul thieving vampire!<br /><br />Buy the book= knowledge  that you own a copy of a classic.	1999-11-23

I recommend this very highly if you are a fan of horror fiction mostly because this is King's anthology that includes one of the scariest, most disturbing short stories of all time (at least that I've read) entitled  simply, The Boogeyman.  That childhood monster that never really goes away.  If you have any conscience what so ever this story will rattle you, I can  only think of two other short stories that I would say are scarier; H.P.  Lovecraft's The Rats in The Walls and Algernon Blackwood's The Wendigo.  The rest of the stories in the collection are undeniably King (if you liked  Salem's Lot you get a glimpse of the shadows in the town in Jerusalem's  Lot, a fantastic atmosphere piece).  It's fun reading, what short stories  should be and IF (note the capitalization) you have a love of entertaining,  interesting reading you just might want to pick this one up.  If you're not  particularly a Stephen King fan I'd recommend borrowing this book from your  local library just to read The Boogeyman, 'cause it's gonna end up in  future horror fiction text books.	1999-11-22

Intrigued more by the title than anything else.  At first the story  was somewhat confusing but if you have any brain activity everything will  make sense in the end.  The depiction of gore was refreshingly unabashed,  although the depth of thought in the protagonist at 15 years of age is  questionable (Aaah, fiction).  My only major complaint was the very  formulaic ending.  I have issues with horror stories ending in a  not-so-horrific way.  Ending is somewhat of an anti-climax and almost of  relief.  That bothers me.  I don't think a reader should feel too good at  the end of a horror story.  Alas, even horror writers have hearts.  A good  read, bad ending.	1999-10-29

Stephen King is good at writing lengthy novels that don't really scare, but make you think &quot;Hey, that was pretty damn  cool&quot;.  This book isn't very long; but that seems to be of little  importance.  The fact is that of all the books Stephen King has written,  this is the one with the scariest ending.  Gypsy curses and the overall  moral message of the book &quot;You Are Responsible For Your Actions!&quot;  all come to a nice crescendo.  An actual feeling of horror (ok, maybe not  horror but a feeling of unease) sticks with you after you read the book.  There is actual impact in retrospect of this book.  It will bother you  (provided you possess a soul).  By the way, DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE FIRST!!!!  It will ruin the book.  Read the book first, then watch the horrible movie.  If not for anything other than the small part the author plays.	1999-10-29

Simple minded critics have attacked the  brevity of the book (I guess the concept of the short story is beyond them)  but it really is a good &quot;werewolf&quot; story.

Which makes it a  faster paced read.  There are some disturbing elements (Stephen King folks,  come on) that might get to some readers.  Particularly one involving a  small girl.

Recently this was voted as the number one book of the century on a certain online carrier's poll.  Reason being:  Stephen King is most likely the most read author of the century with the  farthest reaching audience.  I won't even try to count the number of  languages his works have been translated into.  So he must be doing  something right.  Granted he may have a juggernaut of PR people and  Publisher backing up the wazoo, but if he made you as much money as he  makes those people you would be on that bandwagon too.  His greatest  accomplishment with this book is that it was written in a time when the  television regins supreme and where reading has lost a lot of its stature  (and popularity?) as an acceptible media.  Just ask any high school student  what he/she would rather do with his/her time: watch tv or read a book?  We  all know the answer to that one and so it is amazing how many younger  people have willingly picked up a book of over a thousand pages in length  with the intention (gasp) of reading it.  The story isn't really new, in  fact it is most likely one of the oldest ones out there, but it is the  approach of the subject that was so damn cool.  This book will stand (no  pun intended, i hate puns) the test of time (as will many of King's books)  and in the future when my generation (I'm 19 at this writing folks)is in  control of the history books, we'll make damn sure this one gets remembered  as literature.  Believe it or not, that's what it is.	1999-09-30

I got this book because I am interested in the roots of popular horror fiction.  This stuff is much more subliminal, much more suggestive than the modern day, in your face type of horror writing.  It's like the convergence  of country and blues that formed rock and roll, if you read it you see  where it's going.  But this stuff is the best, the original, usually set in  places where there isn't electricity.  So when it gets dark there, it  really gets dark.  A great compilation by a master of creeping suspense and  the monster in the shadows.	1999-09-21

Strangely enough I didn't notice the length as I was reading, a sure sign of something well written.  I do admit that I noticed some similarities to  Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot;, the small band of people on both  sides good and evil searching for each other in the hopes of self  preservation, the singular evil entity, etc., etc., etc.  But where as  Stephen King's tale had more spiritual overtones  Mr. McGammon's tale draws  more on the human belief in good triumphing over evil without any true  dedication to religion.  Which should help it appeal to a broader audience.  My only complaint is that the evil guy, the &quot;man with the scarlet  eye&quot; was just not that scary.  Disturbing yes, but he didn't hold a  candle to the possible evils I felt Stephen King's &quot;Randall  Flagg&quot; capable of.  He seemed weak, and I just thought that evil would  probably be represented in a much more powerful, encompassing figure.  But  hey, I didn't write the book now did I?  This is a good way to pass the  time if you are bored and decide that you want to stimulate the &quot;ole  imagination&quot;.  Pick this one up if you can handle it.  Oh yeh, if you  haven't read Mr. McGammon's book Boy's Life I suggest you check that one  out as well.	1999-09-20

In good.  In evil.  It will take you down into the very depths of the human soul.  It will make you take a better look at yourself.  It will make you remember  child hood strife, the smell of a summer afternoon, and your first  encounter with a mystery.  This book is probably one of the best books  written in the 1990's.  It's not horror, it's not fantasy, it's  entertainment.  This is everything a novel should be.  A classic.  If you  haven't read it yet put it on your list of things to do.  Simply awesome.	1999-09-20

I have read several of the reviews posted here and many of the not-so-good ones are just plain confusing.  People say that it isn't the &quot;old&quot; Stephen King, that it isn't &quot;scary&quot; enough.  But  have any of you out there really read Stephen King?  Do Any of you  understand that Mr. King has fallen under the label of a &quot;horror&quot;  writer?  Probably not.  I hope every one who picks up any of his books  isn't always looking for gore and monsters.  He's done that, sure he has.  But what kind of writer would he be if he didn't attempt (and I daresay  achieve) other genres.  Stephen King has never truly scared me.  Well maybe  the short story &quot;The Boogieman&quot; did.  Everything else he's  written has just been interesting, entertaining reads.  This book is no  exception.  Gripes about the story being too short, too involved with  baseball, uninvolving and the likes either come from readers who are biased  against the works of Stephen King or who just cannot grasp the concept of  writing as expression, as art.  If the palette of the writer doesn't hold  many colors than the work becomes boring, overdone, the same old thing.  I  praise Mr. King for his jaunt into children's fare, but can it be labeled  as such?  There are simplicities in his writings that hide complexities  that haunt the mind.  So whether it's a town filled with vampires, a writer  plagued with an evil twin, a hotel haunted and just maybe possesed, or a  little girl lost in the woods pursued by &quot;something&quot; it all boils  down to one great conclusion: Stephen King can write, he gets paid darn  well for it, his family will never go hungry, and if you don't get that  maybe, just maybe, you ought to apply for just a few more brain cells!!!!!	1999-09-18

The perspective might throw off some readers but if you can't adjust to different styles of writing than maybe you should go  back to &quot;See Spot Run&quot;.  The setting and circumstances are all  too real and anyone knowing anything about the horrors of disease unchecked  will be deeply moved by this book.  The sense of helplessness is more than  aptly achieved by Mr. O'Nan.  My only minor complaint is that the  Deacon/Constable's descent into self preservation/insanity was too brief  and that maybe, just maybe, the necrophilia could have been done without.  But the effect was achieved, at least in my case.  I can only hope that  this book achieves literary status and wins some type of award because  something great has been done here.	1999-09-11

Ok, this book should have been the first hint that Stephen King was much more than a writer but an emerging literary talent.  Think about this, the late great Stanley Kubrick agreed to direct the film.  The same guy who  brought us Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange.  Kubrick must have  thought the novel to be something important.  Remember that.  I have seen  some reviews that slam this book on style and character development and  there is only one thing I can say about that,  those people need some  serious help in the reading comprehension department.  The novel gets under  the reader's skin and creeps upon the mind.  The alcohol child abuse theme  is haunting in itself and the fact that little Danny (the psychic child who  &quot;Shines&quot;) sees things no one else can stirs the cauldron of  relationship-frustration between his father and himself.  There are images  that are startling (although the term horror probably doesn't apply and is  too wantonly thrown about)and bits of dialogue that will stick with you  (Here's Johnny! not one of them mind you) such as the infamous  &quot;Redrum&quot;.  Bottom line is this is a deeply moving psychological  thriller that is perfect to read on the first snowfall of the year, in the  house, all alone, with maybe just one light on...	1999-08-25

Lovecraft.  I was not disappointed.  Some of the scenes were just a little too sci-fi for my taste but the parts with the narrator trapped in his monlith house as it is attacked by grotesque beasts were just plain scary.  For the time  period when this was written it is definitely a revolutionary horror tale.  I'm surprised that it was even published for the time.  If you like horror  and want to see the influences on some of your favorite modern day fright  writers I suggest checking this book out.	1999-08-18

I purchased this book after realizing that Edward Gorey was the wonderfully sinister artist behind the scary illustrations in most of the books by John Bellairs.  What a pleasant (yet disturbing) surprise it was  to see the alphabet written in such a memorably deranged way.  The shock  value alone of this book is great (just imagine an elementary school  teacher handing this one out!!!) If you can appreciate anything sick and  twisted and if you like any form of dark illustrations get everything ever  drawn by Mr. Edward Gorey!!!!!!	1999-08-03

This is the best book ever.  I read it for AP English and was dreading the assignment. But when I read the book I was completely blown away.  The overall message of the folly of prejudice was nothing but the purest satire  ever created.  The writing was directed toward a mass audience with a  heroic purpose, and the intellectuals of the time understood the message.  Segregation, prejudice, and the devil of SLAVERY were so aptly addressed  and yet, so subtly that it went over the heads of the non-intellectuals of  the time.  Hailed as a masterpiece of an adventure story it was so much  more.  Some reviewers have hinted at homosexuality in regards to the  relationship between Huck and Jim. There was nothing but  an honest friendship between the two.  MAD PROPS to my main man, Mr. Samuel  Clemens (a.k.a Mark Twain).	1999-08-01

For an author who has been called by some as a &quot;wanna be Stephen King&quot; this was definitely not what I expected.  Sincerely chilling and disturbing I don't see how Mr. Saul's fanbase isn't much, much larger than  it is.  This is a serious case of critics being wrong, (and when I say  wrong I mean they missed the freakin' moon on this one) A superb tale of  supernatural intrigue in a small town setting.  Hands down, if you like  horror fiction (I'm not just talkin staples like Dean Koontz and Stephen  King, I mean like John Farris and Peter Straub) then don't pass this one  up.	1999-07-29

A chilling foray into the what if genre that never lets go.  The slight shallowness of the characters leads the reader to care greatly for them and to feel their pain, their sadness,  their terror.  If you wish to read one of the darkest portrayals of  Armageddon (and perhaps the quickest)  I suggest seeking this book out.  Hopefully it's out of print status will change.	1999-04-20

The sheer immediacy of the tale changed that.  This book is philosophical to the hilt, questioning the general concept of reality  itself.  The reader begins to mistrust everything, especially government  rule and its version of justice.  A true revolutionary novel and one of the  best written, ever, hands down.	1999-04-20
