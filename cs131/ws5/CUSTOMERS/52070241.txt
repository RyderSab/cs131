Michael Chabon's Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Bret Easton Ellis's Less Than Zero, and Ethan Canin's For Kings and Planets were all very unbalanced and unoriginal and detracted from their best works.  Tom Perrotta's attempt is the most convincing and the least pretentious of the bunch, but it is still not up to par with his short story collection (Bad Haircuts), where for a brief moment, I thought he was Raymond Carver reincarnated.  We don't need another Ivy League Bildungsroman with contemporary identity issues and rehashes This Side of Paradise, thank you very much.	2002-03-18

Michael Chabon is a much better writer than the other two, but he also shroud his characters in the same inaccurate light.  The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is a very fragmentary and immature piece of work about a college student named Art having bisexual trysts.  The characters are very stereotypical, and seemed to be put together by super glue.  This Side of Paradise and The Catcher in the Rye it is definitely not.  If you really have to be immersed in cultural cliches and unrealistic narrative, read The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.  At least you can learn some new words.	2002-01-08

Each story is written with no apparent finale.  When it does have an ending, it tends to baffle the reader rather than offer closure.  I especially disliked the title story where the first person narrator is omniscient only half the time.  It's more annoying than innovative.  It seems that Chabon didn't have enough materials to write a novel, and thought, &quot;why not write a bunch of stories with disputable continuity and call them vignettes?&quot;  I suggest that you skip this book, or you'll be thinking less of a great writer.	2002-01-05

I liked them because they had a lot of teen sex in them and were banned by the library.  But as a twenty-something and a much more seasoned reader, Sex and Sunsets is just a recycled romance novel.  The plot is implausible, a happily married woman falling for a stalker (albeit a very dumb and ineffective one)?  The dialogue is very choppy, and there are enough cliched situations and stereotypical characters to make you puke.  Just like babies need to be weaned, you should do the same and move on to more solid books.	2002-01-04

Travesty is just a transcript of a driver talking to his passengers before crashing the car in an &quot;arranged accident.&quot;  Along the way, he pontificates about love and betrayal, a collection of cliches and bad epigrams.  Nothing really happens in this book, just this guy rambling on and on.  I'm glad this book is out of print: it will save the world a lot of time.

His short stories are great because they are brief, and are told through actions and conversations, not sentimentality and excessive introspection.  Blue River, like For Kings and Planets, are undisciplined works, perhaps too ambitious, with overwrought language and too much filler material.  A much better story with the same theme appear in the Palace Thief, called Batorsag and Szerelem.	2001-12-29

But when it comes to something so sweet and unpretentious, I can't help but be mesmerized.  Ethan Canin is as witty as O. Henry.  Perhaps due to his medical training, he pens intricate and perfectly logical stories.  His stories, like Raymond Carver's, have the supernatural ability to be minimalist yet breath maximum emotional turmoil in the readers.  There are four novellas in this collection, my favorite being the City of Broken Hearts, about the connections between a lonely father and his pregressive-minded son.	2001-12-28

If you're one of those people who can't appreciate Picasso's Cubist paintings, you'll be just as frustrated with this book.

Less Than Zero, for example, is just two hundred pages of ramblings by a preppy druggie, interspersed with the usual snuff film encounters and gay sex.  Fans of Ellis can counter by praising the &quot;realistic&quot; writing, but pick any homeless man on the street and he could write better.  This book has no soul, and pity those people who compare the protagonist to Holden Caulfield.  They might as well be spitting in Salinger's face.	2001-12-24

I can't say enough good things about his short stories (My favorite is A Small, Good Thing), which manage to say so much with so few pages.  His poems, however, are not as good as his short stories.  They lack the continuity of his stories, as well as the practiced craft of more experienced poets.  The line changes seem awkward, and there is not a consistent theme in each sub-collection.  These poems are not meant to be read by poetry afficionados, but by precocious teenagers who need a little encouragement to start writing for themselves.  Carver's stories should be required reading for any human being, but if you like to read poems about the same themes, check out Carl Dennis or Tony Hoagland.	2001-12-24

If you want to read the best book on pedophiles, read Lolita.  It will make you cry and puke at the same time.  The End of Alice will only make you do the latter.  One of the flaws is the excessive introspection by the main character.  Unlike Humbert Humbert, he's just too charmless and pathetic to derive any sympathy from readers.  At the end, I didn't really identify with him.  I could have gotten a better story from Penthouse Forum.	2001-11-26

I especially enjoyed Emperor of the Air, each story is simple but poignant, almost Carver-esque.  Which makes For Kings and Planets so much more of a let down.  Instead of the unobstrusive prose, Canin chose to write in flowery prose, something he is simply not good at doing.  Writing a novel instead of vignettes is also not Canin's forte, as the plot goes everywhere and the third person is unconvincing.  The book is also too preachy, especially about the meaninglessness of education in favor of precocity.  I highly recommend Canin's short stories, they will change you.  But don't pick this book as your first, because you'll never want to read this guy again.  If you like to read about Ivy League schools and precocity, check out Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise and Salinger's Franny and Zooey, respectively.  About boyhood relationships that turn sour, read Chabon's the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.	2001-11-16

Were they the top of the class, or the slackers?  Why did they pick the school?  Perhaps the editors could have supplemented the book with a short biography of each writer.  Better yet, have a student unaffiliated with the school infiltrate the medical school and do the writing.  Each article was overwhelmingly positive, and ended with the writer saying &quot;great school,&quot; &quot;high-quality education,&quot; etc, whether if it's Hopkins or the University of Southern Florida.  Were they afraid that the schools would sue them for defamation if they pointed out the shortcomings?  The descriptions of &quot;Preclinical Years&quot; and &quot;Clinical Years&quot; took up most the space, when I could have gotten more up-to-date information from brochures.  Perhaps the Social Life sections could have been expanded, since this is the only thing that's not available elsewhere.  This book will not help shorten the list of the schools you'll be considering, but make it longer.  If you really need to buy a book about medical schools, get the Medical School Admissions Requirements from AAMC. It is updated annually and gives selection factors and prerequisites, and will save you a lot of money when it comes to deciding which schools to apply.  If you're really interested in the school, go on a tour and ask around, or schedule a telephone interview with a med student over there.  When it says on the introduction &quot;Peterson's did not verify and cannot vouch for the accuracy of information contained within these profile,&quot; how can I trust anything I read?	2001-11-07

Writers like Delillo and Proulx are considered avant-garde for their \\"innovative\\" postmodern symbols and \\"stylish\\" metaphors.  Readers are duped by the sparkling reviews and consider themselves inferior to the so-called elitists.  Ethan Canin is the exception.  His prose is sparing, but each word speaks a sentence.  Read the story about a child stowing away in his father's car and listens as he commits adultery in the backseat and you'll cry.  If you enjoyed the minimalist prose of Carver, you'll fall in love with Canin's stories.  We need more writers like Canin who pay attention to the vicissitudes of human relationships.  They will never go out of style.  But post-modernism will.	2001-11-05

The comparisons defy comprehension, and one has to ponder over them, finding nothing, and move on, blaming him/herself for missing something.  The prose is very artificial, lacking the smoothness of a practiced writer's terse sentences.  Hidden beneath the contrived paragraphs is just another conventional love story about two widows trying to find reasons to love again (Yuck!).  Then there is the setting: a small town in Newfoundland, where the inhabitants drink, work on boats, and talk like pirates.  This book is a bad work of art and an insult to its readers.

The prose is really bad, with exaggerations and flowery words (more like a Venus flytrap).  Donald Antrim seems to have written the book in one night, because the events don't make sense.  My advice is start with one brother, and go up from there.  Leave this bin of mumbo jumbo for graduate students and intellectual snobs.

This collection of stories are about the same main character, Rhoda, a wanna-be writer with loose morals.  This prose is not innovative at all, but rather a desperate attempt to make sense of something I'm not interested in.  The book suffers from the flaws of both bad novels and bad short story collections.  The stories are about the same person but not ordered chronologically.  Skip this author and read the true masters of modern fiction like Morrison or Proulx.	2001-09-25

This is one of the most boring books I've ever read.  Boring introspection of demented southern belles and feminist wanna-be's.  There is no innovative prose in this book, and almost no plot.  The stories are mostly about one person, Rhoda, but the tone of the protagonist changes constantly.  It seems like a desperate attempt on Gilchrist's part to put together a full length book.  A failure for America.	2001-09-25

The Color Purple and the Bluest Eye have more tension, while the characters in Clover are all either good at heart or able to be redeemed.  Even though the first person narrative is believable, it is not as impressive as Morrison's.  This is a short and easy book, so it's a good appetizer before moving on to the more sophisticated novels.	2001-09-20

In both respects, it fails miserably.  Chinese writers should not try to emulate an established American form (the novel is a mixture of harlequin romance and feminist melodrama), but instead venture to new territories.  This book is both pretentious and treacerously unoriginal.  If you're looking for a good Chinese fiction, skip performance artists like Amy Tan and Hong Ying, and read the short stories of Ha Jin or the novels of Gish Jen.	2001-09-19

This book is well-written, but it lacks tension, humour, and anything resembling a plot.  The use of flashbacks to tell the story is ineffective and confusing.

The lack of quotation marks makes it a very frustrating read.  The prose resembles a screenplay with pages of dialogues interspersed with descriptions.  The Irish dialect is tough to understand.

Skip this book, as well as Ken Kamler's Doctor on Everest (who was on Camp II all the time), both of which are filled with tremendous conceit and lack of flow.

This is that book.  Now that I found it, I want to share the treasure with you.  This book describes the occupation of the peaceful Greek island of Cephallonia during WW2 by peaceful Italians soldiers, including a captain whose obsession is with playing the mandolin.  The use of images is breathtaking, especially those about the travails the soldiers went through on both sides and a haunting description of a firing squad.  Also laudable are the uses of subtle allusions to Greek myths, as well as the virtuosic switching of narrators that made the story more lively.  I give it four stars because the end dragged and the authors portrayed the Italian soldiers as saints, while the Germans were murderous, the Greeks insincere, and the British insouciant.  But altogetherm this is a great book.  Why do you need a movie when you can live the book?	2001-07-10

This book doesn't break any new grounds in terms of plot either (the friendships between the two boys seem vaguely reminiscent of Farewell to My Concubine), but it does involve adolescent friendships and comic books, two things that I treasure still.  I was glued to this book for two nights because it brought back so many memories of my childhood.

But he has lost his power to grasp his readers, like in the Chronicle of a Death Foretold.  The imagery are becoming a little excessive in some parts of the book.  It was good that it was kept short, as his other novels.	1998-05-22

Skipped Parts was a great book depite its vulgarity because of the touching storyline.  Not so for this book, since it lacked any sweetness.  Sam was robbed of all his goodness by the author, and at the end, he no longers resembles a Holden Caulfied kind of character.  Instead he is like one of the Raskolnikovs or one of the sadistic characters in the gang of Mishima's The Sailor Who Fell from Grace from the Sea.	1998-05-22

The characters are brilliantly sketched out.  Morrison is a brilliant artist with an exceptional talent in evoking powerful and unexpected images.  She paints her characters with perfect fluidity.

The basic story revolves around a teacher named Theresa who goes to bars at night picking up guys.  She rejects genuine love from a good man named James and gets killed at the end by one of the guys she was sleeping with.  The story is very predictable and I can't identify a bit with the protagonist, making the reading very diffcult indeed.  One of the most pessimistic books I've ever read.

A both entertaining and informative book by Tim O'Brien.

This book could very well be the first of a new literary genre.  Tim O'Brien's is a very provocative raconteur and tell his stories with so much passion and elegance.

The Foundation Trilogy proved to be a milestone and gave science fiction-literature of the 50's a complete face-lift almost overnight.  This new type of science-fiction literature was much more profound and intellectual and focused more on the human psyche rather than green-eyed monsters with ray-guns.  Eventually, others followed Asimov's steps, the most famous being Frank Herbert.  What Asimov accomplished was truly amazing, and that explains why the Trilogy won the Hugo Award for the best science-fiction series of all-time.  There are four more novels in the series, read them and I'll guarantee you'll enjoy them	1997-08-26

The characters were portrayed beautifully, with Morrison's uncanny talent to describe.  The flaws built into each character made the book unbelievably realistic, while the magical appearance of Beloved was amazingly surrealistic.  The protagonist, Sethe, while an all-loving mother, is nevertheless too excessive in her love.  Paul D, while sincerely loving Sethe, is still a sexist.  Baby Suggs, although a caring community leader, spends all day lying on her bed after the &quot;misery.&quot;<br />Other than the successful depiction of the various characters, Beloved is filled with many flashbacks, impeccably told.  I gained a new understanding and also a different perspective on the postbellum era.  Morrison has really done it this time, creating the masterpiece which haunts and delights at the same time.	1997-08-26

It ends with Amory's declaration, &quot;I know myself...but that's all.&quot;  But what does that mean? The novel is okay.  Amory reminds me of holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye.  Holden believed in honesty and detested phony people and phony things, so he went all over the place trying to stay away from all the phoniness in the world. Amory is like Holden in the extent that they each had a journey which reveals to them new things and expands their horizons. What I don't like about the book is that Fitzgerald inserts numerous poems that he made up. They are put in inappropriate places and don't make a lot of sense.  Also, every character in this book lives a luxurious life and looks beautiful and is pedantic and speak incredibly long and grammatically correct sentences.  It is like Melrose Place (except the stuff about the long sentences).  What enrages me more is the fact that at the end, even though Amory gains a greater knowlege, he still views the poor as stupid and unclean.	1997-08-26

Other than that, there are the ubiquitous appearances of the raptors, three times might still be exciting, but thirty times is just plain bit annoying.  A pot-boiler if there ever is one	1997-08-26

Margaret Atwood explores the human psyche in this poignant novel about a female protagonist who takes a retrospective on her life by painting pictures of her childhood.  Atwood uses different colors to describe the world of artist Elaine Risley.  And the use of flashbacks was very effective in telling the story.  The main conflict of the novel deals with the reconciliation of Elaine with Cordelia, her childhood tormentor.  There is an Elaine and also a Cordelia in all of us, always fighting for domination.  Elaine could also be Atwood's alter ego, since their childhood events sometimes coincide.  I enjoyed this book very much (though it could've been shorter) and would recommend it to any man and woman	1997-08-26
