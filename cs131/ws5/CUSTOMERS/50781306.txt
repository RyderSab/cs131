But hey,  this is not the first time i have read a book that is as moving. But definitely the book gives you a peek into the aparthied situation in Southafrica.  Just a peek,  there are more worser things happening there.<br /><br />I honestly struggled to read the book and understand it because of the language.  I like simple language,  which is understadable in todays world.  And i think if this book was re - written in not so poetic style,  i would have loved it.<br /><br />Its a tough read.  You need to clear your mind of distractions to understand the book.<br /><br />But seriously whats the hue and cry all about!!!! Not fascinated.	2005-04-23

A definite short list at the pulitzer for this year,  the book is all about American confused desi( country men).  Very well written and beautiful description,  it definitely is a great book.<br />Its a story of a migrant couple from the slums of calcutta to the skyscrapers of boston and the various adjustments and confusions that go through the minds of the family.  The mother trying to stick to the traditional values inspite of being in a western surrounding and her son Gogol,  who is the soul of the book,  trying to cope with the differant cultures enforced on to him.  It portrays various ways in which an american indian looks at his homeland,  sometimes he is ashamed,  sometimes he wonders why the world thinks india is great but never does he feel proud of his homeland. And I wonder why,  not just for Gogol but for the millions of confused desi living in america.<br />And Jhumpa has understood this core very well,  her style of writing is brilliant and there is no unwanted informations, nor does the book bore you at any point of time.	2003-11-18

Tho i was too young to watch him during his peak years,  he always facinated me and would watch his recorded matches a lot.<br />In this book he reveals the emotions of each of those matches and points,  and it was a real pleasure.  You can never hate him,  but you can never be his greatest fan.  what you would admire in the book is his honesty.  His passion for life,  family and game of tennis is very admirable.  A great living legend but still a human being with emotions and anxieties just like u and me.<br />His patriotism is irreplaceable.<br />Definitely he puts in a lot of humour into the book also.<br />To compare the game of the williamses with the college professionals that was uncalled for.<br />To enjoy this book you really need to know in and out of tennis,  the legends,  the matches,  the controversial points.......<br />But for a tennis fan,  this is the best treat<br />Thankyou and Kudos for a great book	2002-11-28

In the Indian society it is a curse to be a widow.  How this young beautiful widow face that death is very inspiring.  Her mental strength is amazing especially in a city described so similar to Mumbai,( the city of the rich,  poor and the poorest of poor). She decides to make a living on her own by tailoring.  She hired two tailor Om and Ishwar.  To make life little cushy she gets in a paying guest Manek.  How the world of these 4 people webs together is the book.<br />Like most of the indian women Dina is a little apprehensive about everything she decides in life.  Like giving space for the tailors to live or letting them take a little liberty in her house.  Maneks makes it all look so simple and in the end Dina gives in to the tailors and they become a family.<br />They then decide to get OM married.  The story takes a tearful turn from here.....  read on. You will never regret having bought this book.<br />A few facts about the details in the book are.....

This is a regular sight one would witness if you travel by train in Mumbai.  There are so many beggarmaster in India....  the reason why begging is so common in this beautiful country.  The humaneness of the poor is so touching....  The cruelty of the law makers towards the poor is frustrating. The humor of OM and Manek is the only reason to smile in the book.  There is so much more this book can teach us about life and living....<br />Rohinton Mistry  has put a lot questions in my mind.<br />Is this book a biography????  Did you witness all that you wrote????.  Why did Manek walk away from the beggars????  That was the most hurting part of the book.  For the first time I cried reading a book.

Fifth Mountain was  my second book and  I thoroughly  enjoyed reading it.  Paulo definitely proves to be one of the best authors  on books of inspiration.<br />In the Fifth mountain he brings to light the  life of Elijah the prophet in a fairy tale manner.  Most of us are not  aware of this aspect of Elijah.  Elijah is put to various tests by the  Angel of the Lord and how he overcomes these tests and tribulations in  life,  this is what the book is all about.  Elijah is given various tasks  in his life by the Angel and how he handles these amidst his own doubts,  beliefs and attractions of life..... is very beautifully portrayed by the  author.  The story is set at a time when idols and Gods were worshipped  alike.<br />It also shows the belief and faith in God can conquer all in  this world.  In his path to becoming a prophet Elijah teaches us various  lessons and one of them is -  it is always necessary to know when a stage  of one's life has ended.  It you stubbornly cling to it after the need has  passed,  you lose the joy and meaning of the rest.<br />A great book	2000-08-30

Reading it was a pleasure and brought back a lot of memories  where I cried when she lost and I jumped with joy when she won.  As far as her tennis carrier is concerned I can remember every bit of  her victories and this book is perfect with dates and  details. It hurts to know her private life is not as fanciful and bright as  the great ladies  22 grand slams are. I wish somehow I  could reach out to her and make her happy. The book is well written and not  biased on any angle.  Her anger and dissentment towards  the press could only be best understood by people who have been tortured by  the media. Her anger  is justified cos after all she is  human and needs her breathing space away from the lights of the cameras.  All I have to say is Steffi is a  great inspiration not  only in terms of her Tennis but also as a good daughter, good sport and a  good human being.

First part of the book highlights the Indian traditions,  cultures and mostly the place of a woman in an Indian family.  Anita Desai has done an excellent job in describing  the indian family to every single detail of existance.  Though this type of  families still exists in India,  Please do not generalise this view to the  whole nation.  It is only a 40% of families that could relate to the book  specially in states where literacy is meagre.<br />I must say however,  there are lots of uma's in India, today,  and all they need is a little  encouragement with education and exposure to the outside world,  and she  could definitely be a very strong woman.  I loved this character of Uma in  the book because she was both willing to take a chance with life and at the  same time dedicated to her family.  And she took all that happened to her  life with such grace that she did not give me a chance to cry for her.  Thats her inner strength.<br />The second part of the book deals with the  dillemma of Arun in a world which he could not have imagined.  Arun,  the  younger brother of Uma reaches Massachusettes for his higher studies,  and  is totally taken aback by the lifestyles of the west.<br />The most beautiful  part of the book is its literatrue.  So well written and with accurate  details,  its definitely a joyful read.	1999-12-29

I bought this book on a day when I was feeling very low and sad.  I sincerely  believe in doing things that make you happy when you are sad,  and one of those things for me is get into a bookstore and fill my  library.  This attitude is one of  the advice that Andrew Mathews has  suggested in  his book. The chapter on setting goals and fulfilling it is  fantastic. The cartoons depicting each chapter and topics are amusing and  makes reading much more interesting. From my point of view and observation  in this world I find that lot of people have a negative attitude even  before they start working towards what they want in life,  be it happiness,  a goal,  etc  etc.  This book is a must for such people.  Andrew has  pointed very well that we have to believe that we can do it and then set  about doing anything in life.  Think positive and believe you can do it  even before you start anything. This book helped me in changing my attitude  towards life,  my marriage (in which i am very happy),  and most important  my belief in myself.  Today I am working  towards reducing my weight by  swimming everyday. Thanks to Andrew Mathews for raising my spirit of life.	1999-07-21
