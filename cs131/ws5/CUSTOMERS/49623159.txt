I don't understand buying a book because the author is married to another author you like, then griping about it being disappointing. If you want Conroy, buy his books. Ahem. But I digress.<br />Dean is married to a man of God who is anything but angelic and happens upon a town of gossips and people to gossip about. She befriends Augusta who is  a free spirit with a past that enables her to make a connection with Dean. Dean discovers herself and how she's sold herself short on life just in the nick of time.<br />I found the book entertaining, fell in love with the little boy, Gus, and wished at times I had a friend like Augusta who would draw attention to the times I was in jeopardy of selling out.<br />It's a good read.	2005-03-03

What she doesn't know, she makes up. She's so against the idea of condensing a book into a book report that she makes up books. She's a wordsmith, and if you're not careful, you might read her to be a bit of a know-it-all.<br /><br />She makes friends with a stranger who doesn't come clean about too much of his past either.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the flow of the book. It is conversationally written and a quick read.	2005-03-03

And I'm sorry in advance to the reviewer who the word \\"disappointing\\" disappoints. I was disappointed in the book itself, not because it was Shreve and I had higher expectations.<br />In summary, the book is about a dad and daughter who are running from the tragic death of his wife/her mother, his daughter/her sister. He gives up his high-roller lifestyle to go live in NH. The story's told from the perspective of Robert Dillon's  12-year-old daughter, Nicky. The two wander the woods and come upon a baby. Then the baby momma comes calling to their house. This is where I have a bit of a difficult time coming to terms with the story: They let her shack up at their house. So you let a gal who's left her baby in the snow stay at your house and get cozy with your 12-year-old?<br />I did appreciate how the story shifts between Nicky as an innocent child and 18 years later, when the story is supposedly told, after she's experienced enough life to get tainted.<br />I thought the story ended up too neatly tied, but was certainly glad it ended.	2005-02-21

From reading other reviews of this book, the author also does a great job of depicting how the disease progresses.<br /><br />\\"The Worst Day of My Life, So Far\\" is about Jeanne, taking care of her mother, Velma who was suffering from Alzheimer. Jeanne promised her beloved father, C. Ray, that she would take care of Velma. Harper does a wonderful job of describing the love between her parents and the relationship she had with her mother. The characters are so well described, the reader can easily connect with them.<br /><br />There, of course, are subplots in terms of her husband, son and brother and his family. All of the characters are woven well.<br /><br />Harper's ability to tell with grace and humor the story of Jeanne, her relationship with her mother and the effects of Alheimer's on the once goddess-like Velma is well worth the read.<br /><br />I didn't like all the Hobbit references. And perhaps I haven't been around my grandmother enough to be as hateful as I at times read Jeanne to be. Perhaps as grandma's disease progresses, I'll understand better.	2005-02-21

There was no way to become bored with the story.<br />This story took place from 1932 to 1972 from several locations and was told first-person by Gussie, her two daughters Clancy and Dorothy, her granddaughters and her maid.<br />Like other reviewers, I wanted to ring Dorothy's neck in one chapter and felt sorry for her in the next. Not too many mothers say of their daughters \\"she'd make me wish I'd caught a faster moving disease.\\" Clancy also grated on my nerves because what trouble didn't find her, she brought on herself. But then when she told her side of the story, you could sympathize with her. I, like other reviewers, wish the author would have finished Dorothy's story.<br />There is everything in here from laugh-out-loud humor to some tear-jerking. And a deep-dark secret you know will eventually come to the surface, literally.<br />This read is well worth your time and once you get started, won't take much of it because it's a page turner.	2005-02-16

The book is that good.<br /><br />Ken Kimble weaves his way through three marriages and God knows how many other women by his chameleon-like charm. He can be all things to all people and is just what the three women - Birdie, Joan and Dinah - who take on his last name need. The women are flawed in their own ways... one with such low self-esteem she just wants a husband, she doesn't care that he's a cheating schmuck. One who is surviving breast cancer and believes herself running out of time and one with a facial scar that's haunted her all her life. He preys on their desire to have a husband and a family.<br /><br />It's an AMAZING book. The way the characters weave in and out of each others lives, and don't get me started on how much I loved the first wife's son, Charlie. If you don't get a little sentimental and weepy over his care and feeding of his sister and the stray dogs, you're too hard-core for me.	2005-02-10

I thought this book was predictable sap. If you didn't have the book figured out from reading the back cover, certainly by about chapter 3 you knew how it was going to end. Regardless, I stuck with it to try to figure out why people were raving about it. While the characters were memorable and developed, there was a whole lot of pouting and bickering going on about problems people face every day.... certainly not enough to build a book around. Grandma Rose is on her last leg, starting house fires and forgetting things so Kate and her husband Ben and their kid Joshua move their little broke tails from Chicago, where they live way beyond their means, to the sticks in Missouri. There, grandma Rose leaves a diary laying around to give Kate insight about getting old, not wasting things and taking time to smell the roses etc. YAWN. Kate's family is all set to send granny to a nursing home but grandma has a mind of her own, although she's losing it chapter by chapter. Really, this book is not very good at all.	2003-04-22

The characters are developed and tied together wonderfully. Enough characters to add flavor and show the main character, Jessie, in a mix of relationships, not too many characters to muck it up. It has the mix of humor, sadness, intrigue etc., to keep a reader interested. I DO NOT know how the reader/reviewer from Seattle who doesn't know who Calvin Thacker is missed his introduction in the same chapter. AHEM.... REGARDLESS... The story is about Jessie Maddox who married years previous for the same reasons she's miserable now... she married for stability, comfort... now her life is mundane and predictable and she thinks the False Sense of Well Being warned about on prescription bottles of her clients isn't such a bad thing to deal with. From the first line: I was married 11 years before I started imagining how different life could be if my husband were dead. How can you not read on? I loved this book and recommend it highly. The advice she gets from her family, from one of her patients, even the advice that the reader doesn't realize she's getting is priceless... The grass is always greener and you always want what you don't have.	2003-04-08

Fannie, my arse. The first 3/4 of the book sets up the predictable last 1/4. There was some humor, but for the most part was pretty dry. You don't remember characters simply because they have stupid names... ie Effa Commander who tells the entire story in first person and Whippy Bird.  I did enjoy the way Dallas portrayed the relationship between the two and Marion Street but would have liked less set up about how they'd become the \\"Unholy Three\\" and more story line about them actually being the \\"Unholy Three.\\" I finished it and stuck it on a book shelf, feeling like it was a waste of a weekend and $.	2003-04-08

She's one worth springing for the hardback version. Her ability to weave characters in and out of a story line never ceases to amaze me. This story takes place in the fictional Elmwood Springs, Mo., although, being from Mo. myself, I can tell you, it ain't all fiction! Characters from another Flagg great  &quot;Welcome to the World, Baby Girl&quot; are reintroduced and we follow a great cast of characters for six generations. Looking back, I can't pick a favorite character. It is one of the few books that had me laughing out loud and sobbing like a baby all in one chapter. HIGHLY recommend it.	2003-04-08

I have to admit, I had to make myself finish it.  As predicted, it was about Darcy Gallagher and Trevor McGhee, the third set of love birds who have to get together to reunite Carrick and Gwen. If you don't get sick of hearing how beautiful Darcy is and get the impression that she knows it, you're probably skimming too fast. Darcy is a gold digger and the most materialistic barmaid in Ireland and she ain't ashamed to admit it.... on about every page. The book's all about how Carrick works his magic to bring the last of the Gallagher clan to their true love.  There's some of the same sexual tension you read in the previous two books with some singing and shopping thrown in. Perhaps the best scene is when Jude's baby is born. Even then, though, Darcy comes across like a greedy twit. As other reviewers have said, you expect more from Ghost Gwen and Fairie Carrick in the end rather than the &quot;ride off into the sunset on a winged horse,&quot; especially after three books of buildup, but they get about a paragraph on the last page. Not nearly as good as the second book which wasn't nearly as good as the first, but Nora loves those trilogies!	2000-12-20

Since the last page of Jewels of the Sun I've been waiting for Tears of the Moon and now, I've marked the calendar for the release of Heart of the Sea. In Tears of the Moon, Ms. Roberts further introduces us to Brenna O'Toole and Shawn Gallagher (as has been said, in other reviews, you need to read the first book to fully appreciate all the characters!) Brenna is as good with a screw driver as Shawn is with a skillet. Shawn works at the family pub while Brenna works with her father. The two have been friends forever but it's something a little more for the VERY OUTSPOKEN Brenna. She lets Shawn in on her plans and he tries to resist her, but jealousy sits in and he soon comes around. Then she gives him some of his own medicine. She's hilarous and if you don't laugh out loud about the way she lets Shawn know how she feels about him, you skipped some pages! This is the second of true loves Carrick, the prince of fairies, works together with his magic in hopes to be reunited with his love whose ghost resides in Shawn's cottage. This is a wonderfully flowing book, in my opinion not as good as the first, but nevertheless keeping me anticipating the next book, which will focus on Shawn's younger sister, Darcy.	2000-10-04
US	49623159	R1SHIANCRE80U6	0671776126	362447474	Plain Truth	Books	5	8	10	N	N	A great book	After Keeping Faith, I wanted more of Jodi Picoult. Plain Truth ranked right up there. Plain Truth is about Katie Fisher, an Amish girl, charged with the murder of her baby. Katie claims the baby was not hers, that she wasn't pregnant, but all evidence points otherwise. Meanwhile, Ellie Hathaway, a big-city attorney fed up with her job and her man, comes to Paradise, Penn., for some R&amp;R and is asked, because she just happens to be part of the family, to represent Katie. Ellie's personal battles are coupled with those in Katie's family who do not understand nor welcome the legal system.  The reader is introduced, via Ellie who lives with the Fishers, to the Amish way of life. Ms. Picoult's representation and descriptions of the Amish is, as has been in other reviews, wonderful. This book has it all, suspense, romance, courtroom drama (which Ms. Picoult portrays wonderfully in several of her books) perhaps even murder. The reader moves from believing Katie to hating Katie to feeling sorry for her. And the friendship that develops between Katie and Ellie shows a bond that transcends two totally different worlds. To sum up, the pages seem to turn themselves.	2000-09-27

Mariah White, for the second time in  their marriage, catches her husband with another woman. The first time, she  was pregnant with their daughter, Faith. The second time, Faith was with  Mariah when Colin was caught in the act. The first time, Mariah tries to  kill herself. The second time, Colin leaves and Faith's &quot;Guard&quot;  shows up. The seven year old starts performing miracles, attracting media  attention, develops stigmata and quotes the Bible, although she's never  been subjected to it. Mariah tries to shield her daughter from the  attention while trying to find out for sure what is wrong with her.  The  reader switches back and forth several times, wondering if Faith is seeing  God or if her mother is seeking attention.  The book ends with a custody  battle between Colin and Mariah and the reader wondering how much  &quot;Faith&quot; they really have and would have if in a similar  circumstance. The book is filled with colorful characters, perhaps the best  Mariah's hold-no-punches mother, Millie. A GREAT book that you won't put  down, and won't forget after you do.	2000-06-13

WHERE WAS THE EDITOR? When you pay $25 for a hardback book, you expect the author to know: that Tom and Jerry are cartoon characters, Ben  and Jerry make ice cream (really, see for yourself at the end of chapter  7), the difference between role and roll when talking about film (she uses  role)... I could go on and on. I hope these mistakes will be fixed before  the paperback because they really take attention away from an otherwise  good book. It's about three women in their &quot;senior&quot; years who,  united at a less-than-pleasant boarding house, take an opportunity to  renovate and move into a home in Covington, North Carolina. Together, they  face demons that have been following them. One is afraid to face her fears  and learns to have confidence in herself. One believes herself to be plain  and simple and finds love, and one finds passion in the simple things, like  growing fruits and vegetables. It's an inspiring story about three women at  an age when they're expected to knit and &quot;grow old gracefully&quot;  learning new lessons about life and themselves.	2000-05-31

This is a book about four women who form a group that gets them through all sorts of trials and tribulations. Imagine Beaches and add two more characters and you've got the Saving Graces (the name of the group... it's  explained in chapter 1.) Rudy, Isabel, Lee and Emma are the four main  characters and each bring problems to the table. The chapters are divided  by character, each &quot;Grace&quot; getting a turn as narrator. The author  did a great job of keeping the women in character from chapter to chapter.  The Graces really come together to rally behind Isabel who faces a battle  with cancer. It's Isabel who teaches them, in the end, the wonder of  staying friends through the highs and lows of life. Perhaps the story isn't  a complex one, but the way the women weave their lives around each other  and stay friends through thick and thin is a warm and well-written story.	2000-05-25

I loved Kit's character...  her strength and ability to weigh all her options in relationships with her  mother, father, brother, men and friends. I just love Ms. Binchy's writing  style, her ability to take me to Ireland and see into her characters'  lives.  Don't be fooled by the thickness of any of Binchy's books... you'll  finish them in three days and wish there were a dozen more chapters!	2000-01-20
