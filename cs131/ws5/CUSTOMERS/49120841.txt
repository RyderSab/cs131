As awkward as that may sound, it certainly makes for some very entertaining reading.  I read the first four books last summer and decided to take a break (particularly, because I really didn't care for book the fourth).  So this summer I decided to start up again.  And THE AUSTERE ACADEMY was a pleasant \\"Welcome Back!\\" to the extremely unpleasant lives of the Baudelaires. <br /> <br />THE AUSTERE ACADEMY is suprisingly the tamest of the first five books; the word \\"tame\\", here means (Sorry, I just couldn't resist putting it this way) a little less violence and a bit less sinisterity from the Baudelaire's arch-nemesis, Count Olaf.  However, to balance it out, Mr. Snicket introduces us to someone almost as wicked: Vice Principle Nero (who strives to be as evil as the ruthless emperor he was named after).  Also in the story, the Baudelaires finally encounter some allies.  And perhaps best of all, Mr. Snicket finally gives the reader the first few clues in the vast mystery of The Series of Unfortunate Events. <br /> <br />Keep reading!	2005-08-07

These are simply short and very sweet books of children's poetry.  They can be read to a child (perhaps one of the best introductions to poetry a youngster could receive) or read by an adult who is mature enough to truly apprectiate classic children's literature and poetry.   <br /> <br />A.A. Milne was a literary genius - that much is certain.  If he wanted to write books consisting of classic and intellectual poetry, he certainly could have and would have.  But his aims were much higher than that.  He wanted to reach out to children and adults everywhere.  He wanted to show that childhood innocence never has to end (see the last few lines of the last chapter of THE HOUSE AT POOH CORNER).  And unlike so many writers who (perhaps with the best of intentions) attempt this amazing feat, Milne succeeded.	2005-07-31

Milne's early classic, WHEN WE WERE VERY YOUNG, reads like a literary fountain of youth.  It's a short little book aimed most likely at those who are not old enough to read and probably only barely old enough to be read to.  Yet fans of A.A. Milne (there are far more adult fans than young fans) as well as lovers of English verse will fall in love with this little book.  It contains 44 poems, all of which are fun and  simple.  The illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard provide wonderful compliments to each poem.  This is the perfect introduction to A.A. Milne.	2005-05-12

But it's interesting reading though.  Daniel Cohen has a knack for weaving historical details into fiction.  None of these stories are too scary for any reader old enough to read a book of this size (64 pages).  The main problem with this book is that there isn't a lot here that is redeemable.  It's not trash, but it's not useful reading either.  If you're interested in fiction of this kind, you might enjoy DANGEROUS GHOSTS by the same author.	2005-05-12

But William Nicholson's SHADOWLANDS (title taken from the final chapter of the final book in THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA) may present a different case to C.S. Lewis fans the world over. <br /> <br />Fans of the movie will be pleased since they are already familiar with the lines spoken by the characters.  But all Lewis fans will be fascinated because this play gives the reader a front row seat (no pun intended) to the life that Jack and Joy had together.  Even though the story does take certain liberties (for instance Joy Gresham had two sons, the elder named David), it's still a rewarding way to spend one's time and is short enough (100 pages) to read in one sitting. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a more factual account of C.S. Lewis's life with Joy Gresham, I would recommend the book LENTEN LANDS by Douglas Gresham.	2005-05-12

Well, he's a Christian evangelist who also has cerebral palsy.  Listen to him sometime.  He'll make you feel very uncomfortable at first, but he'll leave you encouraged and pumped to serve Christ. <br /> <br />His autobiography JUST AS I AM (same title Billy Graham used for his) is a fascinating read.  It's very difficult to put down even for the slow, undisciplined readers like myself.  His motto is: \\"I have cerebral palsy.  What's your problem?\\"  In other words, I have cerebral palsy, therefore I don't fit into normal American society.  But I'm not letting it hold me back.  I still working and fighting as hard as I can to serve the Lord.  So, what's your excuse? <br /> <br />This message which is the focal point of David Ring's ministry initially makes the life-long church-goer very uncomfortable.  But if you listen, and act, this is a message which will change your life. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  It's not one you'll easily forget.	2005-05-09

There is a myriad of books out there on Christian parenting as well as encouragement for Christian couples and parents--books which provide wise counsel for the sometimes overwhelming complexities and frustrations in married life.  And I'm glad these literary sources are available. <br /> <br />But in all the hoopla over how tough married life is, most people tend to forget that single life is no walk in the park either.  In fact, in this day and age, being a Christian single is very tough.  This way of life is certainly not for wimps or the faint of heart.  Christian singles today face constant adversity and judgementalism.   <br /> <br />These come from two sources.  The first source is, of course, the secular world, particularly Western media.  We live in a world which encourages and even stresses sexual and emotional romantic intimacy between the sexes without the need for the \\"outdated\\" and \\"archaic\\" institution of marriage. <br /> <br />The other source, unfortunately, is the church itself.  Most people in the church today believe in an academic sense that God has ordained some people for a life of marriage and others for a life of singleness.  But that belief stops there, because it is not evident in their speech or interactions.  Many in the church look down on singles.  They like to quote Bible passages such this one from Genesis: \\"It is not good for man to be alone.\\" In doing so, however, they totally ignore the fact that God wanted a populated earth and this was impossible with one lone man.  Such a belief also ignores the fact that Jesus Christ was single and so was the apostle Paul during his Christian ministry. <br /> <br />I say all this because Dr. Tony Evans's book, BEING SINGLE AND SATISFIED, effectively addresses these concerns--or as effectively as any 55-page book could.  (And because this little book is only 55 pages, even a slow, lazy reader like myself can easily get through it in one sitting.)  Dr. Evans also does a wonderful job imploring the Christian single to not just sit idle waiting for Mr./Miss Right.  Dr. Evans reminds us to approach single life with a Kingdom-oriented attitude.  I was especially impressed in the way Dr. Evans stresses that the sovereignty of God is revealed by the Christian's marital status.  In other words, I don't have to feel ashamed or embarrassed as if I'm single because I'm not good enough to have a wife.  I'm single because God is sovereign, and He knows what He's doing. <br /> <br />Probably the most impressive illustration in the book is that of Ruth and Naomi.  When Naomi tried to get Ruth married off (and probably had the best of intentions at the time), Ruth decided instead of returning to Moab where she would be more likely to find a \\"suitable\\" husband, to go to Israel simply because she had become a believer in the God of Israel.  She was willing to risk never marrying again (she was a widow) just to obey and follow God. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book enough!  I highly recommend it not only to singles but to married couples as well so that they will understand the kind of sovereign God we serve and how He sometimes works in the lives of His people.	2005-03-29

In fact, this book shows that reason in striking and graphic detail.  But good poets are difficult to find nowadays anyway.  Good story-telling is also hard to find nowadays.  And yet Jimmy Stewart does some wonderful stroytelling in his little book of poetry.  If you can read these poems and hear his voice in your head at the same time, then they're a lot easier to read.  Many a college student today will read assigned poetry by Byron, Frost, Shakespeare, or Tennyson and come away with nothing.  But even the most unpoetic reader will come away from this book with a smile on his or her face.    Although it appears to be out of print, as of my typing this, Amazon currently has over 300 used copies available - at least 10 of which are selling for under $6.00.  I think I paid less than a dollar for mine.  And with a mere 32 pages anyway consisting of only about five or six poems, there's no reason to pay much more than that.    So, the book is available.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2005-03-15

Imagine if Monty Python had had the opportunity to do with classic children's fairy tales what they did with Arthurian legend.  Herein, tales like Cinderella, Goldilocks, Snow-White, and Little Red Riding Hood (among others) are brought to life in a much different way than many of us may be used to.  Roald Dahl has created a world in which Goldilocks has inadvertently tracked dog excrement into the bears' house; Snow-White helps the seven dwarves pick the winning horse, courtesy the Magic Mirror on the Wall; and Little Red Riding Hood packs a revolver to deal justice to a cross-dressing wolf. <br /> <br />This may not be the ideal place to begin a youngster's literary journey.  But it's perfect for anyone else, especially those with a dry sense of humor and a love of good satire.	2005-02-17

The book also explains a brief history of the island of Alcatraz in addition to a brief account of its final days.  One of the major themes of this book is that not everyone will be shut up.  Out of every prison, or every situation, there is a way out, and there is an escape if one is only willing to take the risks. <br /> <br />Along with colorful illustrations which tell a story by themselves and photographs which provide historically accurate detail, the book also tells an exciting though quite short, true story about the legendary island of Alcatraz.  The text is not overrun with needless detail nor is it too general.  What I liked best is that by the end of the book, the reader feels as if he or she has just been given a tour of the island prison.	2005-01-27

In fact, she seems to be afraid of everything except her house which hangs dangerously over a cliff and the other newcomer to the island, Captain Sham who bears a striking resemblance to...well, I don't want to give too much away.    Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) excels in this third book in terms of his use of clever humor and dry wit to twist and turn the plot.  The reader is also exposed to the darker sides of Count Olaf.    Overall, this is a great addition to the series, and with ten books to go, it does well in keeping the reader interested in the series.	2005-01-13

In this story, the young king and his knights get shipwrecked on an island where Arthur befriends a dwarf and a giant. <br /> <br />One of the great things about this book is that it teaches the young reader to look past physical differences and see the \\"person\\" on the inside.  For instance, when King Arthur and the giant first meet and become friends, the giant helps King Arthur by providing him with a place to sleep for the night and food to eat.  Likewise, King Arthur sees strength and potential in the giant when he asks him to drag his ship out to sea in return for his and his father's voyage to England.  Especially remarkable is the fact that there is not violence in the book; no battles and no killings.   <br /> <br />Because of the large amount of text, this picture book will go far in developing the reading skills of younger children.  Unfortunately, there might be (at least for some) a little too much detail in the text.  This may tend to bore younger and more inexperinced reader.  Also, some parents (or teachers) may be alarmed by the picture of a unicorn nursing a human baby. <br /> <br />Overall, this book would serve well as a good picture book for children who are at the age where they need to start developing their reading skills more.  It's fairly long for a picture book, and reading it in one sitting may present a challenge to younger readers.  However, it is for this reason that this book develops better reading skills.	2005-01-13

Indeed, the witty narrative and humor are (for the most part) just as plentiful in this book as in the previous three. <br /> <br />But in terms of plot and characters, Lemony seems to be running out of steam.  The plot twists and happenings in the previous books were always far-fetched but still believable to some degree or another.  However, in this book they are simply far-fetched.  Also, Count Olaf (this time in drag) came across as far less menacing than in the three previous books. <br /> <br />I will soon be reading the fifth book and expect it to far exceed the quality of this one.  I realize that with thirteen books in a series, there's going to be a bad apple or two.	2005-01-13

Delightful for the appropriate ages	This book deals with the subject of the supernatural and consists of a series of short stories, most of which are the classic ghost stories.  Each chapter is a different story, and the author, Daniel Cohen, claims that every single story (or report as the case may be) is totally accurate.  This is not to say that all the stories are true (most of them are quite far-fetched), but that all the stories and reports were made by people who claimed they were true. <br /> <br />The major strength of this book is simply that it provides excitement and suspense page after page.  All the stories are short enough to read in one sitting (and so is the book, for that matter).  The details and word usages which the author uses makes the reader feel like he or she is right there in the story.  But despite all its merits, this book can easily make a younger reader a bit uneasy.	2005-01-12

It's not that it's a lighthearted family story or anything like that.  One needs a good story like that every now and then.  Unfortunately, his writing style seems to be sub-standard on this one.  And the characters are not quite as believable or intriguing as in any of his other books I have read.<br /><br />My primary problem with this book is that the main characters - Luther and Nora Krank - did not seem to me to be skipping Christmas.  I think the only thing they were trying to skip was a huge commercial racket.  And it is virtually impossible in this day and age to celebrate Christmas without skipping the horrible racket.  I was especially encouraged by the following  statement made in chapter three:<br /><br />\\"It was entirely possible to enjoy Christmas without cards, without parties and dinners, without needless gifts, without a lot of things that for some reason had been piled onto the birth of Christ.\\"<br /><br />But the criticisms aside, this is an enjoyable book.  Even a slow reader (such as myself) could read it in one sitting if desired.  But if it's a Christmas commercialism laugh you're looking for, then I'd recommend the essays \\"Xmas and Christmas\\" and \\"What Christmas Means to Me\\".  They can both be found in the book GOD IN THE DOCK by C.S. Lewis.	2004-12-25

This book made memories that had been locked away for over twenty years come alive once again.  This book made me remember my own special education teacher, a sweet and brave woman who devoted her life to her kids. <br /> <br />My other reason for loving this book so much is that I am now helping a second grader at my church with similar problems as the kids in this book.  I'm pleased to say that all of the techniques Mary MacCracken used to reach Hannah (Lovey) in this book have worked for me in the short time (just under a year) I've been working with this kid. <br /> <br />It's true that this is a very out-of-print book.

I usually ignore crazes and fads in literature (yes, I'm afraid this also includes Harry Potter).  I just don't like getting sucked into something that everyone else and their dog are into.  But seeing THE BAD BEGINNING and its sequels on the shelves for so long started sparking my interest and curiosity primarily because when I first bought it, there was virtually no hype around it at all.  I never heard anyone talking about Lemony Snicket or any rave reviews or anything.  But now, with a new film soon to be released from Dreamworks (and starring Jim Carrey as the evil Count Olaf), more and more people are starting hear the name Lemony Snicket.<br />For someone who has just written ten New York Times bestsellers, one would not have thought that Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snicket) would have started this literary endeavor with the attitude that he could never write a children's book \\"because children's books are such crap.\\"  But THE BAD BEGINNING is clearly a break from the norm in children's fiction, especially children's serial fiction.<br />The author does a wonderful job of throwing his wit into the mix of chaos and turmoil in the plot.  For instance, every now and again, he'll use a word which many children may not understand, but he'll explain it its context, saying, \\"...a word which here means...\\"  For example, on page 121: \\"But thanks to her adroit inventing skills - the word 'adroit' here means 'skillful' - everything worked the way it was supposed to work...\\"  And for humor, Sunny, the youngest of the three orphan siblings (and a mere infant), will often say things like \\"Hux,\\" \\"Gibbo,\\" \\"Jook,\\" and \\"Book!...she probably meant something like 'Would somebody please wipe my face?'\\" (80)<br />At one point in the story, the author even goes so far as to play with the reader's mind a little bit.  If you've ever found yourself falling asleep while reading (perhapsyou're even nodding off while reading my review - if so, shame on you!), then you'll recall that you may unconsciously read the same sentence over and over, because you can't remember if you had read that part before dozing off.  On page 94, Klaus (the young boy orphan) is staying up late one night reading:<br />\\"The book was long, and difficult to read, and Klaus became more and more tired as the night wore on.  Occasionally his eyes would close.  He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.  He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.  He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.\\"<br />Much of the wit and plays on words and grammar will make this book equally appealing to adults - a word which here means a physically and mentally mature person who is young at heart in terms of his or her literary choices - as much as the exciting story will appeal to kids.	2004-07-12

But it is good for a laugh or two.	I picked this book up because, at first glance, there were several things which I could immediately relate to.  First and foremost, this book is for humor.  Secondly, remember that this book is not written by a scholar or even by a professional writer.  (Due to the numerous typographical errors, I believe it is safe to say that the book did not even have a professional editor.)  I realize it is impossible to write a book about contemporary Christian culture without stepping on a few toes (regardless of whether or not the toes needed to be stepped on).  Even I had my toes stepped on while reading this book.  In fact, one of the complaints I have against the author is that it seems like he's stepping on everyone's toes except his own.    But I also have a hard time believing that a Christian cannot pick this book up and laugh himself or herself (to avoid offending the politically correct) silly.  I think one of the funniest points in the book is when he lists the top 3 \\"Jesus Junk\\" items which should have never been made.  The #1 item was \\"Test-a-mints\\".  \\"Freshening your breath and witnessing to your neighbor at the same time is a little difficult with the Scripture verse dissolving in your mouth.\\" (130)    I can only give this book three stars, because, in spite of its many light-hearted merits, the book tends to over-stereotype church people (pages 18-23, 96-102) as well as poke fun at certain theological issues which do not belong in the \\"poking fun\\" category (i.e. \\"Three Types of Virgins,\\" page 109).  I also disagree with his criticisms of people like James Dobson and Jerry Falwell.  (Unless \\"Jack Files\\" was a reference to someone else.)    But in the author's defense, he never claims his book to be perfect or even Holy Spirit-inspired.  Actually, the only claim the author makes about the book is that a sense of humor is required to enjoy it.  Well, I have a sense of humor, and I enjoyed most of it.  So, I'll give it a decent rating (for the most part).	2004-07-09

One of the major strengths of this book is the pictures which depict the text.  There are many pictures in this book (and why not since it is a picture book?), and they are all fun to look at, sometimes even producing the occasional laugh.  There is also interaction near the middle of the book in which the child gets to work out a decoding puzzle (using hieroglyphics).  So if a young child is easily bored with books, there he/she may get a break from the reading.  And the puzzle is central to the plot as well, so the child will feel like he/she is assisting the main character.    A major problem with this book is that the text looks more like notes from a lecture or someone's diary than the narrative of a storybook.  Although, I have no doubt that the author did this on purpose, it will most likely not provide a worthwhile reading experience.  It will certainly not assist in developing reading skills.    I could recommend this only as a fun book for kids.  But there are tons of picture books out there that are not only fun but also cultivate and develop good reading skills.  Unfortunately, this is not one of them.    3.5 stars	2004-03-30

It involves a father telling his young son (and the son's friend) about the Civil War -- of which several battles took place on the land where the house is being built.<br />This book was in poetry form which would probably make it easy for even some of the youngest readers to read and enjoy.  The pictures were some of the best that I have ever seen (as vivid as Chris Van Allsburg - THE POLAR EXPRESS, JUMANJI).  The paintings of the Civil War battle scenes (which appear as almost in a dream-like state) were vivid enough and realistic enough to make any reader stop and take in the view for a considerable amount of time before going on to the next page.  One of the remarkable things that quickly impressed me about this book was its stance on the subject and principles of war.  One of the lines spoken by the father really puts the theme into an interesting perspective:<br />\\"...though every war is sad, and most are bad...\\"<br />Another very touching point in the book was when the young boy asks his father if the Civil War was as hard for the men fighting it as it was for him in Operation Desert Storm.<br />The topic of this book is a universal one.  I think that as long as a child is old enough to walk and talk, then they are old enough to be taught at least a little about their nation's history Civil War - whether that history include a revolution or a civil war or slavery.	2004-03-29

I read this book while serving in the Air Force and while serving a temporary duty assignment in Saudi Arabia.  On more than one occasion I was amused to see an NCO's reaction to the book I was reading.<br />Having been a member of the only military fighting force in the world that isn't too proud to make fun of itself, this book is easily one of the most memorable pieces of literature I had the pleasure of coming across during my enlistment.  Will Stockdale, backwoods redneck/draftee, is the Huckleberry Finn (with a bit of Forrest Gump mixed in) of modern military fiction.  One of the funniest dialogue exchanges occurs when Will and his pal Ben - a short bespectacled gent whose chief ambition (initially) is to bust into infantry - are talking about how horrible it would be if they got selected to go into the Air Force.<br />&quot;...Will, do you know what they call men in the Air Force?&quot;<BR>     &quot;No, I don't think I heered say.&quot;<BR>     &quot;They call 'em...airmen.  By dog, Will, don't you see?  How'd you like to be called an airman?&quot;<BR>     &quot;By God, I just don't think I'd stand for it...&quot;<br />But Will and Ben's ambitions later tend to change when considering (among other things) the many decorations one may receive in the Air Force and how easily they can be acquired.  It's especially humorous when Ben points out,<br />&quot;I believe you stand just about as good a chance of getting [medals] in the Air Force as any place...Why, today, you can get a medal by just not doing anything wrong...&quot;<br />It was at this point that I began to wonder in the other American military branches - or those of our allies - award their brave men and women the Good Conduct Medal (the recipient earns this by not getting demoted); the Longevity Medal (serve for a minimum of four years); and other awards and honors just for showing up.  NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS - written by a former officer of the U.S. Army Air Corps - made it clear that some things inour military are just downright hilarious if you can look at them from the right perspective.<br />Even if you don't have the military experience, this short, lighthearted, and reader-friendly book is sure to please as it brings to mind reminders of FORREST GUMP, GOMER PYLE, and...oh yeah...NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS (starring Andy Griffith as Will Stockdale).	2004-03-26

Actually, we were required to watch a filmed stage version of it - starring Paul Newman as the Stage Manager.  I found it very difficult to watch.  I was, along with many other students, very bored watching that production.  So, I decided to just read the play.  (Reading the play was not required.)  It was nothing short of fantastic and amazing.<br />I'm not the kind of person who reads plays and enjoys them.  But OUR TOWN read almost like a very reader-friendly novel.  And its themes of birth, life, and death have a tendency to reach out and grab the reader like few books I have ever come across.  I will definitely be reading this again.	2004-03-22

US	49120841	R11OA1IJ1A8711	0140235159	876620292	Dear Mr. Rogers, Does It Ever Rain in Your Neighborhood?: Letters to Mr. Rogers	Books	5	34	34	N	Y	Overflowing with wisdom, compassion, and grace	In November of 1998, I was sitting in a computer lab/library at an airbase in Saudi Arabia when an unusual magazine cover caught my eye.  It was an issue of ESQUIRE, and taking up almost the whole cover was none other than Mister Fred Rogers, grinning from ear to ear.  I read Tom Junod's marvelous article about this heroic man (you'll have to find a copy of the article to learn why I use the word \\"heroic\\") over and over and over, many times out loud.<br />So my fascination with Mister Rogers was rekindled for the first time in more than 15 years.  But as a child I was mostly fascinated with a magical trolley which could transport you into an enchanted land called Make-Believe.  Mr. Junod gave me a much deeper - and therefore, much more fascinating - glimpse at what this man is like.<br />He was a man who loved children and the adults who once were children as much as he loved himself.  He hated television.  He believed (or so his actions seem to convey) that his outflow of compassion was as much a necessity for his survival as his intake of oxygen.  And his favorite word was grace.  In fact, if you met him in person and received his autograph, he would write the word \\"grace\\" underneath it - in Greek.<br />Unmerited favor received from God.<br />Believing his standards to be no higher than that of God's, Mister Rogers strove to treat others with as much grace as he had received.<br />The reason I state all of this is because it will all be proven when you read DEAR MISTER ROGERS.  This book, containing letters both to and from Mister Rogers, shows that he can be funny, sad, nurturing, and firm.  But he was always compassionate.  Never in this book is he ever insincere.  On more than a few occasions, he proves he does not lack the humility to admit some of the mistakes he has made in life.<br />Some of the letter exchanges are very cute.  None are more so than the one about the father whose little boy insisted that Mister Rogers doesn't \\"poop\\"; to which Mister Rogersreplies, \\"I am a real person.  And, one thing for certain is that all real people 'poop.'\\" (Page 7)<br />The fact that Mister Rogers had a hand in compiling and editing all of these letters, shows his sense of humor.  For instance, in the final chapter, 17-year-old Tyler writes<br />Dear Mister Rogers,<br />In your younger years did you get a lot of chicks because you were Mister Rogers?<br />(Page 185)<br />Some of the letters will provoke different emotions, like the ones from Alexandria, who at the tender age of four, was suffering from leukemia; and another letter about one child who listened to (rather than watched) the program because she was blind.  (Interesting side-note I learned from Mr. Junod's article: Mr. Rogers was color-blind.)<br />Unfortunately, it appears that this book is going out of print.  But this book is one of those rare gems that are worth looking hard for.  I guarantee that this book will bring you pleasure every time you read it.	2004-03-10

I knew very little about Frederick Douglass when I first set out to read his autobiography.  We had to read three or four chapters for our American Literature class.  But when I saw the size of the book I didn't think it would hurt to just go ahead and read the whole thing.  I'm glad I did.<br />When you ask the layperson who Frederick Douglass was the answers you usually get are runaway slave, orator, abolitionist, and the like.  Are these accurate?  Yes.  But try this one:<br />American Hero!<br />We usually think of Benjamin Franklin as the ultimate self-made American.  But it was actually Frederick Douglass.  Yes, Franklin started with virtually nothing and worked his way into financial and professional prosperity, finding success in a variety of fields.  But Frederick Douglass did the same thing, except he started with absolutely nothing but the rags on his back.  (He didn't even start out with his freedom!)  He risked his life to prove that a free man is the best man.  Even as he wrote his autobiography, he refused to mention the details of his escape, fearing that it would jeopordize the possible escapes of other slaves.<br />One of the things that I found very disturbing in this book (there are many disturbing passages in this book) was the fact that of all the slaveholders he had to contend with, the most brutal of all were the ones who claimed to be Christians.  (I'm glad that Douglass was himself a strong enough Christian to not be misguided by those pious hypocrites.)  One of the saddest passages in the book is as follows:<br />&quot;Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, next to that enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me.  For of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst.  I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others.&quot; (Page 85, Signet Classic)<br />This was a very controversial statement made not by someone who gets his kicks from mocking Christianity, but by someone who has experienced, first-hand, the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ but then had to suffer at the hands of people who claimed that their &quot;love&quot; for Jesus Christ gave them license to brutalize and torment any under their charge.<br />I believe that Douglass knew the dangers of going public with this information.  I believe he knew of the possibilities of his being returned to a state of slavery - whether it be through political unrest and upheaval in the North, or kidnapping, or any possible way.  I believe that he knew that there would be people in both the South and the North who would want to see him dead because of what he was saying.<br />This is why I call him an American hero.atement made not by someone who gets his kicks from mocking Christianity, but by someone who has experienced, first-hand, the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ but then had to suffer at the hands of people who claimed that their &quot;love&quot; for Jesus Christ gave them license to brutalize and torment any under their charge.<br />I believe that Douglass knew the dangers of going public with this information.

It is an easy and quick read.  It is not intended to be complex nor hard-to-understand.  Yet so many haven't the first clue as to what this book is all about.  It's about &quot;enlarging one's territory&quot;, which Mr. Wilkinson states over and over and over again refers to one's ministry for the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br />Nowhere in this book does Mr. Wilkinson ever say that the prayer of Jabez is more important than the Lord's Prayer.  Nowhere in this book does Mr. Wilkinson even remotely insinuate that the prayer of Jabez is more important than our individual and unique everyday conversations with the Lord before we go to bed or while we're driving or in the shower or at church.<br />I've had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Wilkinson speak in person.  I remember him saying that once a woman came to him and said that after reading his book, she only prays the prayer of Jabez and no longer prays the Lord's Prayer.  He actually told her that if that was what she got out of his book, then she needs to get rid of his book and never read it again.<br />What really boggles my mind is the number of people who say that this book espouses name-it-claim-it theology (or prosperity gospel).  Actually, Mr. Wilkinson is adamantly against such teaching.  When he encourages the reader to ask the Lord to bless him/her, he implicitly means to bless with ministry opportunities.  (Few, if any, prosperity teachers ask the Lord to bless them with ministry.  It's usually, &quot;Lord, bless me with another 'seed offering' so I can send out the anointed prayer cloth and afford my private jet.&quot;)<br />I agree that the &quot;Prayer of Jabez&quot; craze has gotten well out of hand.  For instance, this book was so simple that a 13-year-old could understand it.  So why need there be &quot;Prayer of Jabez for Teens&quot;?  And &quot;Prayer of Jabez for [fill in the blank]&quot;?  But the craze is first the fault of the consumers who went crazy over a book which is not intended to make one go crazy over; and second the fault of the (I'm assuming Christian) publishers who responded to the fans and sacrificed ministry principles for excessive profits.<br />It's okay to pray that the Lord will bless you.  Whatever the blessing - whether it's a new ministry, or a new Corvette (yes, I'm afraid sometimes the Lord does bless us with material blessings) or a new child or a new disease (unpopular though it may be, sometimes the greatest blessing is a ticket Home!) - it's always going to be something with which we can glorify Him.went crazy over a book which is not intended to make one go crazy over; and second the fault of the (I'm assuming Christian) publishers who responded to the fans and sacrificed ministry principles for excessive profits.<br />It's okay to pray that the Lord will bless you.

It's a good rule of thumb: Never judge a book by how boring the first chapter is.  But once you're into chapter two, this book sucks you in and doesn't let you back out.<br />I was amazed at how suspenseful the book could get.  What's amazing is that it will frighten you without letting you know what it is you're frightened of.  But the level of suspense is definitely higher than that of any children's book I've ever read.<br />The author seems to successfully combine the symbolic theology of C.S. Lewis (e.g. OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET and PERELANDRA) with a tiny bit of the hard-core science fiction of Arthur C. Clarke (e.g. 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and 2010: ODYSSEY TWO) and somehow make this mixture interesting and thrilling for readers who otherwise would not have been interested in either subject.<br />I didn't know when I started reading this that it was the first book in a trilogy.  But, now, having read it and loved it, I will definitely be reading the rest of the trilogy.	2003-09-30

My professor recommended the use of this book for our Spanish class about a year ago, and the help it provided was invaluable.<br />Many people (my professor included) have warned about a student being overly dependent on this book.  And indeed that is a huge probability.  In my case, I was very dependent on the book.  But one of the things that helped make me a little less dependent was to write on a blank sheet of paper about 10 to 15 -AR, -ER, and -IR verbs.  Then I would conjugate them (the most common being HABLAR, IR, COMER, LEER, etc.) in at least four or five different conjugations (or however many our class had to know at a given point).  Sometimes I would write out the conjugations over and over and over again just to make sure I had them memorized.  This was especially good exam preparation.<br />All 501 verbs in the book are conjugated in 15 different ways.  In the back of the book there is an \\"Index of English-Spanish Verbs\\", a pronunciation guide, and an index containing over 1,000 additional verbs not included in the first 501 which point to the page number of the conjugated verb which provides the \\"model\\" for others like it.  For instance, if you can't find the conjugated verb, EVITAR (to avoid), in the book, then you can simply turn to this section in the back.  When you see the word EVITAR, it will tell you to look up the conjugation of GRITAR (to shout).  Then you simply conjugate EVITAR using the same rules and patterns as GRITAR:<br />(presente de indicativo)<br />evito<BR>evitas<BR>evita<BR>evitamos<BR>evitáis<BR>evitan<br />Furthermore, there are an additional 12 helpful sections in the back of the book to further assist a student in learning verb uses.<br />The semester in which I bought this book marked the first time I ever made an \\"A\\" in any Spanish class.  (Glory to God!)  Even though I'm now done with all of my undergraduate Spanish courses, I still intend to hold onto this book to help further my Spanish vocabulary and speaking skills.<br />I can't recommend this enough!	2003-07-16

It was little more than a nice children's story with pretty good character development, but it seems that the author was not interested in developing the story more.  She also could have done a much better job of explaining the character Beauchamp (the antagonist).<br />I thought that the illustration of Rob's (the main character) emotions being locked inside a psychological suitcase, though initially creative, soon became over-used, worn out, and emotionally manipulative.<br />The book does have a few things going for it (hence, the two stars).  Probably the main thing in its favor is the story of how Rob overcomes his grief and unhappiness through helping his friends.  However, this is the second book in a row by this author to have such a story.  And this is, in fact, the second book by this author.  The first was BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE.  The themes were very similar, as were the characters, except that in WINN-DIXIE, they were far more interesting, and the story was much better developed.<br />I look forward with eager anticipation to what Mrs. DiCamillo's next book will be like (I believe it will be available in late 2003), because, having read WINN-DIXIE, I know she can write much better than TIGER RISING.  Another fantastic alternative (with similar themes) is BRIDGE TO TEREBITHIA by Katherine Paterson.  It is also easy reading without taking away from the complexities of the characters or the captivation of the plot.<br />On one last point, having read several Amazon reviews before reading the book, I was very disappointed to read the outcome of the story which one reviewer had put in his review (without any warning to the reader whatsoever).  I wish reviewers would have a little more consideration for people who have not yet read the book.  The purpose of reviews is to inform those who may wish to purchase the product, not to destroy their enjoyment of it.	2003-07-11

Norman Wright was when I first picked up this book.  But the title looked like something that was relevant to many situations and struggles I've faced in my own life as well as the kind of struggles that are all-too common in today's world.<br />Whether you're struggling with clinical depression, a minor case of the blues, or fear of rejection by others, this book has some very important things to say.  Probably more than anything else though, this book is a cure for the common Pity Party.  Mr. Wright points out, and rightly so, on page 94, \\"Another benefit of the blues is feeling sorry for yourself.\\"<br />Although the principles in the book are Scripturally based, the author does a very good job of always maintaining a healthy balance between writing his own book and filling in blanks with Scripture.  The Scripture passages he uses are very helpful, but he doesn't try to \\"church\\" the reader to death.  Also, the author writes this book for the layperson.  There's nothing in this book that's too complicated to understand.<br />At many places in the book, Mr. Wright may merely identify the general cause of the blues, and by so doing, I was left thinking, \\"Yeah, that makes plenty of sense.  That's exactly where I'm at!\\"  Then there were other places in the book in which the author seemed to know my most secret thoughts and most personal struggles.  Chapter 8 hit me the hardest.  Therein, the author identified some major problems in my own life that I guess I always knew were there but really didn't want to admit as problems.  (Even as I type this review, I still don't want to admit it, but I know I must.)  This chapter, which concentrated on relationships, helped shed some light on things that I've been doing wrong...things which on the surface sound good, decent, and well-intentioned.  But the author offered clear, fundamental reasons why these things were unhealthy.<br />And that brings me to a very important point I'd like to make about this book.  Although it offers pleanty of encouragement and comfort, it is by no means simply a book in which an author puts his tender hand on someone having a pity party and saying, \\"There, there\\" the whole time.  Quite often Mr. Wright just states it how it is, leaving the reader feeling challeneged and possibly uneasy.  But sometimes the only way to be cured of something is to first feel the prick of the needle that delivers the vaccine.<br />The cures and treatments in the book are usually quite simple (except for clinical depression which may require counseling and possibly prescribed medication).  They usually consist of repeating statements about oneself, out loud, which reinforces a positive mental self-image.  Moreover, the statements are well-grounded in Scripture and point to the fact that in the eyes of the Savior/Creator we need never be discouraged (particularly the ones found on pages 44; 95-96).  Now, I know that doing this may make one feel kind of ridiculous at first, especially if you've seen as many of Saturday Night Live's \\"Stuart Smalley\\" skits as I have.  But doing this actually does produce positive results.<br />Several different passages of the book I thought interesting enough to underline included<br />\\"Who we are today is a product of how we remember our past events.\\" (18)<br />\\"Remember that God has already declared us to be sufficient enough through what he has done for us through Jesus Christ.\\" (11)<br />\\"When we're discouraged, we don't have hope.  But hope is an antidote to discouragement.\\" (19)<br />\\"When we relate to...Jesus Christ by faith, we have the potential for inner wholeness.\\" (37)<br />\\"Whenever you're sad or blue or discouraged, ask yourself the comparative question: What would I be thinking if I were basing this on a positive truth?  Then write it down.  That's what to concentrate on.\\" (97)	2003-01-25

I was held back in the 6th grade (unlike Joshua, in my case it was my own fault), and though Joshua didn't realize it, he was actually very fortunate to have been held back earlier rather than later.<br />Susan Shreve must have been held back herself as a child, or had at least one of her own children held back, or dealt with many students who have been held back.  She writes the story in such a way as to meet the reader right where they are.  She seems to identify with someone who has had to repeat (or is in the process of repeating) a grade for whatever reason.<br />Although it is a very short story (initially written for my generation -- see the \\"Pac-Man\\" refernces), it still brings home some very important messages for young kids struggling in school, whether it be academically or socially.  Also, in the tradition of Katherine Paterson's \\"Bridge To Terebithia\\" and Louis Sachar's \\"There's a Boy In the Girl's Bathroom\\", this story also does a wonderful job of offering us the character of a teacher who is able to reach the student on a deep and meaningful level...the kind of teacher we never forget about no matter how old we get.	2002-06-06

However, this story about a young airman awaiting court martial, has absolutely none of the poetry, imagery and excitement of &quot;DWW&quot;.  The characters, though interesting at first glance, are underdeveloped, and the ending silly and unfulfilling (although, if I'm not mistaken, I believe that at the time that the novel was being finished, Mr. Blake was dealing with cancer).  The different plot twists do nothing in the ways of building to a climax.  Actually, the most dramatic part of the book is when our hero, assigned to permanent latrine duty, has to deal with the messes made by all the guys of the dormitory who are all suffering from the same food poisoning all at the same time.  This is definitely not the ideal book for those who enjoy the kind of great writing contained in books like &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;.	2002-06-05

As a huge fan of children's literature, I didn't really understand what could be so great about a story of a girl and her dog.  And in and of itself, it isn't so great.  So, why read it?  Because there is a measure of greatness and wonder in this book.<br />The greatness of this book lies in its simplicity.  Little India Opal Buloni and her preacher-dad have just moved to a small town called Naomi in Florida.  When she takes in a stray dog, things start changing for the new girl in town.  Beforehand she was shy and bored.  Now, she is meeting people, making friends, and even making friends out of potential enemies.  It's an enjoyable read that doesn't bore you with irrelevant details; and every chapter wastes no time in getting straight to the point.  Even a slow reader like myself could finish it in one sitting.<br />Like I said: this book's greatness is found in its simplicity.  There's no jaw-dropping plot twists or anything like that.  It's just a sweet celebration of friendship.<br />P.S. Thanks, Julia.	2002-03-07

It wasn't wonderful, but it was a fun read.  The majority of the plot twists are fairly predictable, but that doesn't diminish the enjoyment of the book.  The characters are well-developed and extremely likeable, even the spoiled rotten, Nellie Olson-ish Raymond Trottle!  Not that I liked him personally, but can you imagine \\"Little House On the Prairie\\" without Harriet and Nellie Olson?  Or \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" without Eustace Clarence Scrubb?  Where would you turn for laughs?  Actually, you could probably turn to the pathetic three nurses who constantly punish themselves for having lost the prince.  The three pitiful nurses insist on eating disgusting, rotten meals, sleeping on rocks, living in a cave, and never bathing...all because they lost the Island's prince.  It's a guaranteed fit of laughter everytime these three unfortunate women show up in the story--always feeling bad about not feeling bad enough!<br />The plot is pretty basic: an unusual and unlikely team of rescuers are appointed by the king and queen of the Island (this book's Narnia, Middle-Earth, etc.) to enter the gump (instead of a magical \\"Wardrobe\\") and retrieve the long lost prince before the end of the 9-day period in which the gump is open every 9 years.  The 4-person team consists of an aging wizard whose hearing is quickly fading; an overly sensitive one-eyed ogre; a fey; and a child-hag (who is actually very normal-looking, and, therefore looked down upon by her hag-family).<br />What first caught my attention was the cover, which may remind one of C. S. Lewis's \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".  If you read it (and if you've taken a recent trip to Narnia), you will be reminded of that wonderful tale and probably many others.  \\"Shrek\\" comes to mind as well.  But I think that that is the mark of greatness when it comes to a good children's fantasy story: an author's creativity and originality mixed in with echoes of previous great stories that have inspired him or her to write this one.	2002-03-04

Bill's story is re-told by his good friend Professor Thomas Walz (now retired from the social work department of the University of Iowa) in such sharp, believable detail as even to go so far as to write the majority of the book from Bill's point of view, using the sort of speech, broken perhaps but very gripping, as Bill had used; this aspect brings a great deal of accuracy to the book.  The Bible says in I Thessalonians 5 to rejoice always and to give thanks in all circumstances.  Bill Sackter took these principles to the extreme, and as a result, made everyone who knew him take a much closer look at themselves and the world around them.  His life still has that effect on people today.<br />I'm not going to say here what all happened in Bill's life; the book will do a much better job of that than I.  However, I will simply say that this book will open your eyes to an incredible sense of optimism little known in the world we live in today.  I can't imagine someone reading this book and being disappointed.<br />One thing more: for those of you who have seen and loved the movies &quot;Bill&quot; and &quot;Bill On His Own&quot; (which have been out of print for who-knows-how-many-years), they are available from the very good people at Wild Bill's Coffee Shop at the University of Iowa.	2002-02-24

Where do I start?  <br />(A pretty good impersonator of) Mr. Rogers tells little kittens everywhere that \\"when you get that special feeling inside, that means it's time to visit Mr. Litter Box\\" in the \\"Mr. Rogers Catbox Video\\".<br />Guy Noir, the sardonic private eye, makes yet another appearance (minus the wise-cracking, tongue-twisting Pete), being handpicked by an ex-con-turned-poet to publish some poetic parodies in the Paris Review, including a hilarious take-off on Robert Frost's \\"Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening\\".<br />\\"Cold Weather\\" tends to cheer you up on those super-cold December evenings when the apartment has no heat (hopefully that's just me).  Cold weather, according to Mr. Keillor can come in many forms including, but not limited to, your teenage son kicking you out of your own house because he's afraid of his friends coming over and finding the dad in the house.<br />\\"You come to New York looking for one thing, and you find another.  And Bob Dylan and Carol Channing found each other,\\" in this spoof of the young sixties generation livin' for today in New York City, hanging out with Truman Capote, Larry King, Kirk Douglas, Paul Harvey, and Mr. Rogers (\\"Found the mushrooms that were so amazing...right here in the neighborhood.\\").<br />\\"Little House On the Desert\\" is a guarantee side-splitter for any \\"Little House\\" enthusiasts out there, when Ma fakes tuberculosis in order to convince Pa to load up the wagon and get the heck out of Minnesota.<br />For Mother's Day, be sure to take your mom to \\"Mel's Big Boy Cafe\\" at the mall.  Chewing is optional.<br />\\"Newt\\" is a toe-tappin' little tune about the former Speaker, which is sure to draw laughs from conservatives and liberals alike.  Likewise, the Bemidji Boroughway [sic?] song provides a strong warning to ice-fisherman everywhere about the dangers of mistaking cigars, brautwurst, and dynamite.<br />I could go on and on and on about how great a collection of laughs this is, but I'll end my rambling with \\"Getting Older\\", my personal favorite from the three compact discs.  This monologue warns us about the dangers of getting older: your grown children getting you as a present one of those stupid books about \\"the joys of aging\\"; similar to \\"Cold Weather\\", the teenage son lectures his dad on not dropping him off at the front door of school anymore; the vegetarian waitress goes ballistic when her patron orders \\"the 47-ounce beef-butt in the hot lard sauce\\" with french fries and butterbrickle ice cream.<br />In short (a little late for that), this collection has something for everyone.	2002-02-21

It reads almost like a literary fountain of youth.  Each letter to each child is personal,  enthusiastic, and never ever dull.  Often, I'd read these letters, feeling  sometimes that they were written just for me; not me, personally, but for  all Lewis enthusiasts, especially the young and young at heart.  The  letters are full of useful, interesting information and express Lewis's  greatest joys and deepest sorrows (i.e. the passing of his beloved wife,  Joy).	2000-09-17

Louis Sachar has written a wonderful story about a group of young boys with checkered track-records  (and wierd names), and how they've pulled together through ultra-tough  times in a dry, hot Texas detention camp for boys--where their punishment  is to dig a hole 5 feet deep, 5 feet in diameter every single day.  Mr.  Sachar then adds a unique twist by tracing the lives and times of several  of the main characters' ancestors (as well as a history of the camp), and  how their actions and decisions help decide the fate of the camp and at  least one of the boys who have been put there. Check it out!	2000-08-16
US	49120841	R1BBNUSCMNSALH	0316102490	830916634	Red Ranger Came Calling	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Looking for a great children's Christmas story?	Then look no further.  But keep in mind, the grownups are likely to be just as captivated by this beautifully illustarted, dry-humored book a bit more than the kids. (I know because I've got a bit of both in me!)  Rest  assured this book is just as funny as a certain Christmas movie about a  youngster who deperately desires a BB gun for Christmas; but &quot;Red  Ranger&quot; is a thousand times more sentimental.  This young boy  confronts an old washed-up man who claims to have once been the guy in the  red suit.  The boy adamantly denies having any belief in Santa.  But his  desire for the coveted &quot;Buck Tweed, Red Ranger Bicycle&quot; is so  consuming that he decides to go out on a limb and place a tiny bit of faith  (probably about the size of a mustard seed) in the old man.  Well, I won't  give away the ending except to say that you'll be moved when you discover  the strange, but fulfilling conclusion to the story about a Christmas  morning that held &quot;the last little bit of an old man's faith and the  first of a sour-faced little boy's&quot;. P.S.  If you prefer a Christmas  story with a Christ-centered theme, then purchase this book and see if you  can't find a strong piece of Christian symbolism (unintended, perhaps) at  the end.  You may have to ponder it for awhile, but it's there.	2000-07-22

Well, it took almost 7 years, but I finally gave into the hype and bought JP and devoured it (no pun intended) in a matter of days.  Nearly all books are better than their movie-counterparts, but very few are as different  from their movie-counterparts as this one.  It took Spielberg a year or two  to make the movie.  But I made a ten-times better movie within a week or  two by reading this book and conjuring up images no special effects studio  could ever muster.  And actually, I'm kinda glad the movie was so  different.  Because when reading the book, I was totally clueless as to  what was going to happen next.  Who gets killed and eaten?  How does Grant  and the kids get out of this dilemma?  And so on...  But the most ingenious  part of this novel is the risk that Mr. Crichton takes at the end of the  book, a risk that very few writers are ever courageous enough to take:  he  ends the book just as the reader is begging for more.	2000-07-22
