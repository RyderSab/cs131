In 1790, the Kentucky frontier was fierce and untamed.  Indians populated the wilderness - feared and hated by the white man.  Brutal raids threatened a newfound freedom, forging a spirit of perseverance for our young nation.  It is this spirit which author Jim Wollard has so brilliantly captured in this powerful new epic since his prior novel \\"Thunder in the Valley\\".  Attacked by Indians in the dead of night, Blake and Blaine Tyler lost their parents to the savage Shawnee.  Their sister was spared - and taken by the raiders.  Outnumbered and fighting fearsome odds, they blazed a trail westward, hoping against hope that they would find her alive, if they found her at all.  Two worlds collided on that open frontier, Indian and white, locked in a desperate struggle for survival and freedom.  And in the midst of the fight, a spirit was born, as wild and free as the land itself.  This is the story of America!	2005-01-05

Although this book was written in 1983, it is just as scary and applicable today.  Rhinehart wrote a very realistic book about nuclear holocaust that could still happen, except probably not by the Russians against the US.  The scenario of thieves, pirates and desperate &amp; fanatical people just trying to survive makes you feel like you are going thru it yourself.  A horrible prospect, to say the least.  I liked the idea to attempt to sail away and survive off the sea.  Having just finished this great book, I feel like I was right there and part of the group.  I wish there was a sequel.

The writers have provided a clear &amp; readable account of all aspects of extrasensory perception and related abilities that gives a vivid picture of the research that established them in terms of both life experiences and laboratory experiments.  In 1967. for more than 30 years, Louisa Rhine &amp; her husband J.B., have been the world's leading authorities on extrasensory perception, and the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University has been the center of research &amp; the headquarters for co-workers from all over the world.  She wrote this book in the hope of reaching &quot;that more general audience which is made up of intelligent, thoughtful, open-minded persons who want to be informed on all topics and who realize something of the seriousness of current cultural trends&quot;.  Basically, ESP means the reception in the mind of information that is not obtained through the senses.  It's main types are telepathy, clairvoyance and precognition.  The forms of ESP fall into 4 major classifications: intuitions, realistic dreams, unrealistic dreams, and more rarely, hallucinations.  The author illustrates each of these forms with dramatic case histories described in letters from and interviews with private individuals - cases that are typical in import but different in specific detail.  She also shows the development of the research in typical lab experiments under controlled condition, emphasizing the complications, difficulties, and rare triumphs that accompany research in such a pioneer area. She also deals with a separate but related extrasensory phenommenon, psychokinesis (known as PK)-the ability of the mind to influence matter directly-and gives specific examples.  I liked her writing style, in easy to understand stories &amp; examples, and hope you do too.	2003-10-30

It's history can be found in the Bible and in the works of Pythagoras, Plato and other philosophers.  In the sixth century B. C., Pythagoras gave his system of numbers to the ancient Greeks and each succeeding generation has been using his theories, more or less.  I liked this book for her straightforward explanations of the meanings and power of numbers.  Her analysis of a number in each of it's five positions derived from the birth date and name has been based on notes taken during thirty years of private counseling and research.  Her accuracy has been proven phenomenal.  She wrote this book because of public demand after lecturing personally and on TV, as well as from her students' requests.

Murnau in his revolutionary silent film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922), and the first movie version of Bram Stoker's classic novel, &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897).  And it is the name given to the lonely vampyre with the restless nighttime thirst in Werner Herzog's chilling film &quot;Nosferatu The Vampire&quot; (1979), here captured unforgettably by outstanding novelist, Paul Monette.  The story begins when Jonathan Harker, a blissfully married young real estate agent, is sent abroad to close a deal with a mysterious count.  One storm-tossed night, the new landowner arrives on a ship with twelve coffins of dirt and the dead captain lashed to the wheel.  Soon the entire town is gripped by plague and Dracula begins to insinuate himself into the consciousness of Lucy, Jonathan's beautiful wife.  She is the alluring and courageous woman who realizes, in mounting terror, that the only way to defeat a vampyre is to give of herself, totally, from darkness to dawn.  Nosferatu, the pale, wraithlike figure with the seeking mouth, is both seducer and seduced in the moving and terrifying climax to the story.  Each night he returns to the living.  Each morning he returns to the grave.  But this time, he finds the one bed he cannot leave before the first light of dawn! A great collectible novel.	2003-10-30

In 1979, after a wide-ranging two-year investigation, the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that President John F.

Identified as the probable conspirators were Jimmy Hoffa, Santos Trafficante, Jr., and Carlos Marcello.  But until 1993, there could be no corroboration by a living witness of the Committee's supposition.<br />In early January of 1992, Frank Ragano, attorney for Hoffa and Trafficante and friend to Marcello, decided to break his twenty-nine-year silence.

Fourteen mujahidin had been trained by the British, given a ground-to-air missile launcher, and sent into Afghanistan to shoot down a Russion helicopter.  Throughout history, the fierce Afghan tribesmen had repelled all invaders, but when the Russians entered Afghanistan in 1979, they brought along helicopters; helicopters that terrorized the mujahidin Resistance, destroyed their villages and young men...helicopters about which Western intelligence services wanted to know a great deal more.  Barney Crispin of the British SAS knew his men were not ready, and now he undertakes his own personal war against Majoy Pyotr Medev's crack squadron of eight Mi-24 gunships in the bleak mountains and rocky valleys of the Hindu Kush, partly out of revenge, partly to bring back the electronic system of an Mi-24 helicopter, but primarily because he has been taught that an assignment is always successfully carried out.	2003-04-12

Great insight into how some of us were not that enthusiastic to &quot;get involved&quot;, but he confirmed my feelings that this was truly an incredible time to live and just how much that time period in history has affected all of us in one way or another.  It is great to see how even though 5 lives were lived very closely in college, once released into the &quot;outside&quot; world, how much different they really are from each other.  It was really interesting to see how each matured(?) in their own way. I loved this book and have advised a lot of friends about it.  Although hard to find, it's worth the effort!

From the examples of these and other Bible people, you will discover how not to back down.

The Hong Kong residence in which she is staying is called the Pavilion of Apricots! It is a beautiful palace filled with an extraordinary art collection, but for Sarah Brent, it has become a virtual prison; the scene of events over which she has no control, which threaten to overwhelm her career, her greatest love and even her life.  Sarah is an ambitious young woman who is a specialist in finding jewels, a designer as well as an agent for wealthy collectors.  She is employed by Theodora Paradine, a ruthless Amaerican woman of whom Sarah says \\"I have worked for Theodora for nearly 2 years, long enough to know that if she wants something-a jewel, a house or a man-her money will get it for her.\\"  Theodora's power encircles Sarah & threatens all that she cares about.  Yet she feels that her own success is tied to her relationship with Theodora, and she makes great sacrifices to sustain it.  For example, as part of her job, she must travel all over the world to jewel auctions to bid on great pieces.  This responsiblity has led to the breakup of her marriage to her physician-husband Marius.  Now Sarah has come to Hong Kong, where she grew up, to see her father and to perform some professional duties for Theodora.  Almost as soon as she arrives on the island, she helps Theodora acquire an ancient and extremely valuable jade belt.  Sarah soon suspects that the beautiful object has been stolen from the People's Republic of China, but when she tries to rectify the siutuation, she runs into a terrifying sequence of events which seems to involve the people she cares most about in the world: Marius, her estranged husband, and her beloved father.  This story is brought to a convincing end in the fascinating manner in which the author's readers have come to expect. (Taken from the jacket for lack of any other reviews).

It is June 27, 1942, nearly three years after the German army invaded Poland and began a war that is now being fought all over the globe.  On board a battered, rusty freighter in the bleak port of Hvalfjordur, Iceland, Ensign Howard E. Carraway surveys the dozens of cargo ships anchored nearby; their decks crammed with tanks, crated aircraft, barrels of gasoline, and other implements of war.  Despite the near certainty of enemy attack and the hazards of a voyage through the brutally cold waters above the Arctic Circle, these ships will sail tomorrow in an Allied convoy bound for Russia (Convoy PQ 17).  For without the supplies she so desperately needs, the Soviet Union may well collapse; German soldiers are even now camped outside Moscow.  Drawing on Ensign Carraway's personal diary and on documents long buried in military files, the author recreates the story of one of the most significant episodes in World War II naval history, an event that was to have far-reaching consequences, not only for the Soviet Union but for every future convoy that would sail near enemy territory.  Above all, Theodore Taylor, the author, has written a vivid and compelling account of a military disaster, and of the simple courage, intelligence, and even humor with which ordinary human beings cope with the terrible perils of war.  Unique B & W watercolor prints also add another dimension to this book.	2002-01-28

When Kit learned she had to write a paper called &quot;Who I Am&quot; for her English class, it was the last straw to her.  She felt as if she hardly had time to think, let alone write.  Kit was too busy worrying about her mother's illness, her younger brother's troubles in school, her older brother's girlfriends, and her little sister's need for attention.  Yet, it was through these family concerns that Kit found the answer to her question: Who am I, anyway?  This is a book about a preteen's teetering between childish blunders and adult insights.  A delightful character, Kit is a heroine despite herself.  Like many 12-year-olds, she's funny when at her most serious, with wisecracks that come straight from the heart.

Jack's Uncle Jimmy is a tough, irascible little tycoon whose pride in his sons is matched only by his determination to get them what he wants: high political office!  Aided by old Jimmy Kinsella's full resources, not least his willingness to twist any arm in the nation, his sons erupt into politics:  Charles is to take the mayoralty, then the governorship, Phil is to act as campaign manager.  And Jack, who once served as secretary to Frank Skeffington (of the &quot;Last Hurrah&quot;), is asked to join in.  He refuses.  Though their boyhood loyalty persists, it dates from the time when the warmth and spirit of his cousins' family life consoled Jack for the mysterious death of his mother &amp; brother. (The radiance of his early years is evoked in the first chapter, a flashback which was published to wide acclaim in the &quot;Atlantic&quot;.)  Now, as a novelist, Jack is a solitary man - so much so that his exquisite wife, in her loneliness, has drifted away from him.  When she returns, their slow, tactful, tender reconciliation so preoccupies Jack that he is unaware of the rift that has opened among the Kinsellas, that happiest, that most triumphant of families.  The earthquake threatens not Charles &amp; Philip, but an entire clan, a family legend, and a rocketing political career.  The Kinsellas' answer is ruthless, brilliant, surprising - and tragic.  In contrast, the quieter but dominant theme of the book - the fulfillment of Jack's lifelong needs - finds a harmonious resolution as the book ends, on a note that reawakens the sunlit sweetness of the opening pages.  Quite a Good Book! (Taken off the cover, in lack of any other reviews)	2002-01-19

This was a strange book and story. Although true, you can't help but wonder how Annie figured that she could have sexual relations with the Bishop and not think of what a child would do to his reputation. I know she thought that maybe the kid would cause him to give up being Bishop, etc.-but that excuse seems awfully naive to me. I also had a problem with the silly sexual details she provides in this book, but then again, everyone knows that sex sells. I feel most sorry for Peter, but I cannot help feeling sorrow for the Bishop and his faithfulness as well, which she did her best to destroy. Any woman that throws herself at a man (or Priest) like she did, fails to garner any sympathy from me - at times it seemed like a little girl writing instead of a mother. Peter should have written this book, but I'm sure his Mother has influenced him too much to see the Bishop's side. Last but not least, since all of this all did happen, the Bishop should accept Peter as his &quot;love child&quot; and provide for him - shame on him as a human being on how he handled this!	2001-09-06

The fact that this is a true story, that a Soviet satellite splattered nuclear debris over an incredible area of pristine land, beauty, and traditions that go back to beginning of time is truly amazing.  I can't help but wonder how many people even know that this accident of space even happened, by now.  The most frightening thing of all is that this could happen again, anywhere, anytime!  There are countless more satellites now up there, and more &amp; more smaller countries are entering this realm as well.  Heaps wrote a very thorough book and should be read for history's sake as well.

Is Murphy's Law correct, or are things really going according to plan?  This book uses humor to reveal God's hand at work in the complications we confront in everyday life.  Some examples in this book: Nothing is ever as simple as it first seems, everything you decide to do costs more than the first estimate, every activity takes more time than you have, it's easier to make a committment or to get involved in something that it is to get out of it, whatever you set out to do, something else must be done first, if you improve or tinker with something long enough, eventually it will break, by making something absolutely clear, somebody will be confused, you can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, etc..  I really liked the approach to murphy's law by understanding that God is in control and does have a plan.  This is a book that should be required reading for everyone!	2001-04-26
