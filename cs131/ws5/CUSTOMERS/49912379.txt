You cannot beat the clear and to the point explanations of Maya's features. I really wish the writers would create individual books on Poly modeling and NURBS modeling.	2005-03-13

The first time I heard about Vol. 3 was at the Flash Forward 2004 Conference in San Francisco. I really looked forward to Billy Bussey and Shane's Chapter's but when I read them they did not have the substance I thought it would pack. Shane gave a few nuggets as far as techniques but it was mostly philosophical garbage (as with many other contributors of the book) that could have been left for an autobiography rather than a book that is geared towards actually teaching the customer something. I would say get the book for some decent tidbits but you would probably get more out of the first volume.	2004-11-12

Not only is this giving you a look at MEL scripting but it is also giving you a course in programming itself. I feel so much more comfortable with Maya now because of the fact I am learning the inner workings of the application. It's almost like learning Flash Actionscripting, you are only scratching the surface if you are just doing basic tweening and moving objects around the screen. Once you learn the scripting side of things, that's when your ability grows beyond basic use of the application.	2004-10-18

This book is supposed to be directed at all facets of expertise. Where it falls by the wayside is that it assumes you already know where the features of the program are. They tell you to go &quot;here&quot; but don't tell you where &quot;here&quot; is. For those reviewers that have the idea that this type of explaination is satisfactory it's not. The purpose of books like these are to explain things to the most novice of users. If you are unfamiliar with the program I would suggest reading some of the Thompson Learning books or go to the Discreet site and order there Tutorial DVD's. This book contains many tutorials and information but it lacks information for the newbie.	2004-08-03

I definitely commend the author on giving us color images throughout the book but as it mentions on the cover it is for the more advanced users of Maya. In no way is this book intended for the beginner to intermediate level. Once you have good experience with Maya character animation then move to this book.	2004-07-30

There is pretty much only two tutorials (Chapter 2 and 3) throughout the book. The rest of the 8 chapters shows case studies and gives long bios of the people that created the work. If you are looking to really learn hands on techniques this is not the book. The CD is horrible, there are only two chapter folders that have scene files. The CD also contains a corny little quicktime movie of Alanis Morisette's video. Get the book used if you must have it.	2004-07-28
US	49912379	R1CIOCYA6UQTG6	0072227184	940005129	Maya 6: The Complete Reference	Books	5	8	11	N	N	Great Book!	I must agree with the first reviewer. This book does set itself apart from the rest of the Maya 6 books. I personally own almost the whole series of Alias/Maya 6 (SYBEX) books and just this one book goes over everything the others do and more except the Maya Unlimited book. This is the first book I have read that actually have tutorials on cool modelling, not just some corny apple modelling or creating the side of a house.  <br /> <br />The only downside is the fact that the CD does not contain movie tutorials. I have gotten a little spoiled from the Sybex books that contain Quicktime video tutorials. But on the upside the CD does contain the source files from the tutorial sections of the book. This book is definitely worth the investment.	2004-07-27

I really wish it delved more into using dynamics for special effects. If you have the previous Maya 5 Dynamics, you are pretty much getting the same info.

It's pretty much a mirror of the Maya 5 Rendering book. It even has the same color showcase of images. The only true addition to the book is the Maya Basics Rendering tutorial video thats located on the DVD (worth $34.99). If you previously purchased the Maya Basics Rendering DVD you pretty much have a revised Maya 5 Rendering book.  The only reason I am giving it a three is because there is really nothing new.	2004-06-11

Pretty much the same information I did with the Maya 5 Foundation book, but with a few added lines here and there and a DVD with movie tutorials of the chapters on it. The same exact color pictures and tutorials. This is really pitifull. If you have the Maya 5 Foundation book and you want to save almost $70 then do so. A good rule of thumb is to wait until you have read a few reviews on a book before purchasing it. Needless to say it is going back!	2004-06-11

The DVD alone that accompanies the book is worth it's weight in gold. The video tutorials, led by actual Alias instructors, go over every Unlimited feature other than &quot;Live&quot; on the DVD (this alone has to be worth over $50). This book is definitely worth the price.	2004-06-11

I originally purchased the Maya 5 Fundamentals and to be honest, beside the boring DVD that accompanies the book, I like the Maya 5 Fundamentals book better. Admittedly the Maya 5 Foundation book got me a little further but the tutorial lessons have no personality. Just follow these steps to achieve this. No real explaination on why.	2004-05-04

Anytime I read a book from  front to back, I know I am getting good and interesting information. Rendering lights, materials, textures and cameras is one of the most crucial techniques that you can learn. It can pretty much make or break a piece of work. This book definitly prepares you. If you can get your hands on the Alias Rendering DVD then you really have a great combination.	2004-05-04

I think I would have enjoyed the DVD more if the individual speaking was the actual author. I enjoy listening to videos where the instructor is speaking candid, not reading word for word from a sheet of instructions. Very monotone and boring.	2004-04-07

The author is known for creating books that show really cool tutorials (i.e. Photoshop). This book really disappointed me. When I saw &quot;Accelerated&quot; I pictured a book that explained the secrets behind what you see on the web. Instead it's a pre-school style book that takes you through the most basic steps. Not in any way meant for the intermediate to advanced user of Flash.	2004-03-25

I love &quot;Friends of Ed&quot; publishing but they could have chosen better work to display. And the fact that there was no CD to see the particular effects hurts the book as well.

But come on. Not only was the CD-ROM boring but the quality was not good. I respect the power of actionscript and it was a nice idea to record a tutorial on CD but at least use real life workflow situations rather than some corny poorly drawn cartoon's. Unless there are better CD-ROM's out there on actionscripting, I would inform anyone to stick to reading the books or go oline and read free tutorials on actionscripts.
