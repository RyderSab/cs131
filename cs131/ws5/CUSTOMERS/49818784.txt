S. Supreme Court when the five jurists failed their responsibilities to the U. S. Constitution, American citizens, and the principles of democracy should be taught in every classroom so that never again is a President appointed in the manner that the unqualified and inexperienced George W. Bush was on December 12, 2000.  The most valuable portion of the book is the documenting of the past historical record on other court decisions that proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that  the court made a political decision and not a legal one.  The evidence is clear that this Supreme Court which had a long history of being supportive of states rights reversed that record for their own personal reasons.  The American people should be outraged and hopefully this book will be widely read by all citizens so that a blatant political decision such as the appointment of a President of the United States NEVER occurs again.	2001-06-20

S. Supreme in handing the Presidency to the least qualified man to ever seek this high office should be required reading for all voters prior to the next election.  The American people and others who love democracy must understand the unique situation when the U. S.

With the insight that only comes from having a front-row seat this tale is told with clarity and insight that will outrage all who love this great country!	2001-06-06

This book should be required reading for all Americans since it so clearly documents that a consensus of legal scholars agree that the December 12, 2000 Supreme Court decision was a political one and not based on any Constitutional basis.  All of America's students should use this small expose on the crime by the highest court in the land to understand why it is so important to ensure that it NEVER happens again. This book was written by a true patriot and he has performed a valuable service in explaining in layperson language the outrageous behavior that set America on a dangerous course that was directly against the will of the voters.	2001-05-25

However, only a quarter into the book, I was mesmerized by the use of language and the intricate tapestry of the tale that the gifted author wove.  Anyone who has had to deal with the strains of an aging mother will immediately identify with the conflicts that Ruth feels as she is sandwiched between being a daughter and being her mother's caretaker.  The author tells the tale in an entertaining manner yet with a steady pulse on the reader's emotions.  The guilt and anxious of Ruth are skillfully drawn as an artist does with a blank canvas in selecting just the right patina of paint.  The scenes are loving illustrated but there is not a trance of being mauldin.  <br />This story of ancient times is really a story of modern times. As in real life, this fictional tale documents that we are all influenced by family background and tensions.  In the modern world, we no longer live with superstition and tradition as does LuLing and Precious Anne.  Yet this is not the heart of the story.  The heart is the familial squabbles tht erupt around every corner of life and this is what the modern reader most identifies with in this powerfully told tale.	2001-03-30

This is a book that will be understood by women at many different levels.  It is the story of a being a daughter, a wife, a mother, a lover, and a friend.

The reader is forced to consider her own views on family and responsibility throughout the enveloping story.  <br />This debut novelist will definitely be heard from again and again because she is a skilled story-teller and not solely because her book was among the lucky few to be selected by Oprah.  Her word choice is at times almost like reading prose.  <br />The only negative is that the author jumps from voice to voice in the narrative and this requires the reader to work harder than is necessary.	2000-10-03

Bush, the most inexperienced man  ever to seek the Office of the Presidency. The &quot;miracle in Texas&quot;  has not worked and the hypocrisy that is rampant in this book and in the  speeches of the man from Texas who does not have the knowledge, skills and  abilities to perform the duties of the President in the 2lst century is  even more so.  This philosophy has not worked in that small experiment  known as the &quot;Texas Miracle&quot;, why should America trust it to work  on a grand scale throughout the country?   Marvin Olasky has had his five  minutes of fame.  This book will not extend it.  It should only be read in  the context of wanting to understand what the message is of the Republican  party in the 2000 election since the candidates are not able to talk in  clear, compelling language.	2000-09-13

I found the visit to the toy store to be a particularly effective  use of graphic nuances that made the reader actually join her on the trips  down the aisles.  The reader feels the real constraint of time that is the  plaque of any one who faces the problems of the sandwich generation today.  The author makes the reader empathic about the compelling pulls of the  protagonist by husband, mother, step-children and baby.<br />Parts of the book  seem disjointed as when the main character, Kate, trips down memory lane.   I am not sure that these scenes added much meat to the story.  They did  provide more insight into the character yet I would rather have had more  details about the emotional stresses she was undergoing as she sought to  fulfill all her demanding roles.<br />The only part that was particularly weak  was the final death scene.  I felt cheated that there was not a clear sense  of the finality.  This is the reason for my evaluation of four stars.  Had  the final scene been more dramatic, the book would surely be a five star.  <br />I'm now ready to read other books by this author who clearly has the  gifted talent necessary to make characters come alive.	2000-08-19

The author has  a knack of the creation of unforgettable characters that you think about  long after the last page.  I am anxiously awaiting another novel from this  gifted author.<br />Even though it is fiction, I found myself  very envious of  the relationship between Ruth and Mrs. Pommeroy.  It is a type of  relationship that every young girl should experience.  <br />The concept of a  young woman ending a generations-long feud seems ludicrous yet the author  makes the storyline work so that the it does indeed seem plausible.  <br />My  only criticism is the description of the Isle of Shoals.  Since this is  where my son and daughter-in-law met and where my grandson was baptized, I  have a special place in my heart for this unique part of America.  Yes, I  know that an author has poetic license yet I would hate for anyone to think  ill of this throw-back to the 19th century.  It is a place of breath-taking  beauty and has a ambience that is all its own.	2000-08-13

Women will not find the small love story aspect of  it as compensation for the details about World War I.<br />This ambitious  author tried to write a book that weaved the thoughts, emotions and history  of several generations.  The attempt, however, made for more confusion on  the part of the reader.  While the subject matter of World War I was  interesting, the middle portion with all the details associated with the  project at the mines was tedious.  Also, the love story seemed flat.  The  reader is not let on the secret of the married man's charm that would evoke  such devotion.  The ending with the birth of the baby seemed to project  2000 fatherly concern that would not have been present at the time depicted  in this slow, moving novel.  <br />The writing about the war is the most  graphic that I personally have experienced.  Assuming that the writer  wanted an emotional reaction to the horrors of war, he did indeed  accomplish his mission.	2000-08-09

The author is not  pretenuous at all in the almost matter-of-fact style that she uses to  describe a privileged life where money was always available to provide the  necessities and the luxuries.  Here we see a glimpse of the reaction of the  privileged class to the horrors of war when it made its way to the door  steps of their salons.<br />The best part of the book though was the insight  into the author's opinions about the philosophy of writing.  Here the  modern middle-class American is allowed into the thoughts and opinions of  one who was raised with all the advantages of tutors, exposure to the best  art in the world, and variety of influential and interesting characters who  sailed through her life.  <br />The book would have been much better had the  author allowed her emotions to shine through when writing about the deaths  of her loved ones.  This is the only flaw in the book and this failure  leaves the reader with a longing to have had more opportunity to learn the  complexities of this intelligent lady. <br />Anyone who enjoys reading about  the aristocracy will enjoy this small, spare book.	2000-08-03

This spare book is a delight and the author's skill in  fully developing a memorable character comes shining through.  This is a  heroine that the reader immediately cares for and wants to root for as she  travels the byroads of youth all alone.  The only regrettable aspect of  this book is that there is no sequel.  I would love to know how she grew  into a fully grown and loveable woman.  This is a book that I would  recommend for anyone who has a young daughter, niece, cousin, or friend on  the threshold of adolescence.

The plotting is unique and I agree with  some of the other reviewers that the middle is the weakest part.  However,  the surprise ending more than makes up for any perceived deficiency.

The plot and structure of the book works  perfectly in luring the reader into the tale.	2000-07-15

Gloria Lamerino may be a fictional character but she seemed real to me.  In addition to providing the reader with a compelling character to  care about, the author gives us a plot that forces scientific insight and  propels a lazy reader into becoming a thinking person.

Intelligent and appealing heroine, Gloria Lamerino, continues to evolve in this novel that makes one glad that  there are so many possibilities in the periodic tables.  The series expands  one's knowledge of scientific in an almost seamless fashion.  Science's  loss with the retirement of the physicist/author is fiction writing's gain.

Now we have another memorable love story set in North Carolina.  In this tale, romance is found in a small  town in the hills of this beautiful state.  <br />This multi-layered novel is  not just a woman's romance book.  It is a tale of redemption and pursuing  goals even when life throws gigantic roadblocks in your path.  The textural  flavor of the book is as vivid as the heroine's quilts.  This book about  the restorative power of love is one to savor on those cold and chilly  nights when one feels all alone in the world.  Even though this is a  fictional tale of a strong woman who meets challenges with strength and  grace, it should stimulate timid readers in pursuing their own dreams.  The  reader can only cheer when the heroine, Annie Taylor, starts her life over,  meets new unexpected challenges, and also wins love and romance along the  way. This story shows us that love affects us all and effects fundamental  changes.  <br />Like Anna Quindlen's BLACK AND BLUE, this book is a tale of  overcoming spousal abuse.  However, abuse is not the predominant theme in  the book. This is a book of hope in the redemptive spirit within us all.   The challenge for the reader is to learn how to be like the protagonist and  tap into it.	2000-07-13

This book works on many  levels.  However, it is the strong central characaters that compell the  reader through the story with its many twists and turns.  I was a bit  disappointed with the ending.  I thought that perhaps the author was in a  bit too much of a hurry to wrap everything up.  After the strong emotional  conflict at the end, I wanted more insight into what happened next.   Instead the reader is fast-forwarded twenty years.  I would have preferred  a short synopsis of the next year after the trauma and then the wrap-up.

It was written about my old neighborhood and the high school I graduated from subsequent to the author's own graduation.  I was in awe as to how  accurately the spirit and essense of the experience was captured.  This is  truly a gifted writer with a professional objectivity to turn true events  into not only a readable book but also an enjoyable journey.  I have  recommended this book to many friends over the years as the best  description of the era.  My other women friends who also attended  parochical school were able to identify with it. This is a quick, fun read  and insight into a time of innocence that is long gone.  As has happened to  me often over the years, I lent the book to a friend and it was not  returned.  I, therefore, had to buy a second copy years later at a  second-hand book store.  I wanted my second-husband to read it so that he  would understand the person I was and how I came to be the person that I am  today.  When I purchased my second copy, I also bought copies for the  classmates that I was still in touch with at that time.  I, therefore,  estimate that I have purchased at least 15 copies of this book.  This is  the only book that I have ever brought in such volume!	2000-07-04

I also had the privilege of being on the beach and watching his  return to space as a senior citizen. This is a man who is indeed an  inspiration and he is continuing to show that age need not adversely affect  your mental or physical skills.  He ends the book saying he expects the  future to bring new experiences and challenges.  There is no doubt that  this is a true statement.  He was, however, too modest to also say that he  will meet these new situations with the same grace and determination as he  has demonstrated all his life.  I for one hope he lives to be 100 so that  he can continue to be the inspiration that he is.	2000-07-02

This well-written documentary provided a glance into a one-sided relationship; not a friendship.  The author in speaking of his  mentor identifies himself as &quot;always his squire even before  knighthood&quot;.  This is hardly what I would term a viable mentoring  relationship. What I could not understand was the why of the continued  interaction -- particularly when the author continually got stiffed with  the bills at restaurants! The author's awe with the writing skills of the  older man from the outset was evident.  Yet he also recognizes him as  &quot;neediest person I've ever known.&quot;  Portions of the work reads  like a self-critical autobiography and it is clear that growth is  occurring.  Yet even when the fatal flaws of his friend are so well known,  he still seeks affirmation from him and is disappointed with the  termination of the &quot;friendship&quot;.  This is an interesting  presentation of a selfish misognist. I am not familiar with the works of  Sir Vidia and book does not lead me to want to read any of his numerous  books.	2000-06-26

I was also envious about the intense commitment and effort devoted to completing a book on this topic.  Finally,  I was envious of the high quality writing, insightfulness and quality of  the research that augmented the presentation of the material. This is a  must read for any one who values and appreciates the need for friendship in  our lives.  I thought the chapter on the need for friendships in addition  to our family relations was right on!  The title says it all: I know just  what you mean!  Thank you for a valuable addition to my library.  This book  will have a special place on my bookshelf after I have circulated it to all  the special women in my life who make my life complete by allowing me to be  their friend.  On the other hand, I may just have to buy them each their  own copy.	2000-06-24

Life is too important to be taken seriously and this view of life is the author's credo.  He makes us laugh at a time when the  world needs more laughs.	2000-06-24

On a plane ride back from Italy, I found myself with nothing to read so I again read the book which my husband had just finished. Once again, I loved the  characters and became engrossed in the characters.  Stuart Woods has a real  talent for the creation of intriguing characters and I am always impressed  with their evolution.	2000-06-24

This is an insightful presentation of characters facing unusual circumstances.	2000-06-24

The author's ability to bring us into the family without intruding on  their privacy is something that we all should be grateful for since it  provides us a means of thinking about what we ourselves would do in similar  circumstances.	2000-06-24

I was totally blown away by the use of  language of this author.  This work does not read like it was written by a  novice. This is a woman who will definitely write more and more great  books.  I,for one, am anxious to read another soon.  This first work  provides fully dimensional characters and an intriguing plot that holds the  reader's attention to the end.  I was caught completely offguard by the  resolution of the historical mystery of the Peking Man.  This unique ending  could only be achieved by a truly gifted writer.	2000-06-07

This is a character that one does not usually come across in a work of fiction.  Only a writer of Anne Tyler's talent could depict such a multi-dimensional man in a basically  female-dominated environment.  My only regret is that an organization such  as Rent-a-Back does not really exist.  There has been more than one  occasion in my life when I could have used the services of such an  organization!	2000-05-26

However, I enjoyed this tale far more than others written about the same geographic era.  Only a writer of her talent can capture the  essence of the era that she chose for this subject.  It is definitely one  of Anita Shreve's better efforts.	2000-05-25

Alice Adams is truly a gifted writer and this book is ample evidence of this fact.  Five  protagonists is a difficult feat and only a truly excellent writer can pull  it off.	2000-05-25

The male mind is usually a foreign animal as far as  women are concerned but this writer has the insight to create a truly  believeable character who garners the reader's interest.	2000-05-25

I have tried without success to read and enjoy all her books.  This book is comparable to Beloved in that they both are slow paced and fail to capture the heart and  soul of the reader.	2000-05-25

This is a book that stimulates thinking about a variety of issues from the need to have a home of your own to alcholism to immigration  and assimilation of foreign cultures into the American way of life.  Any  one who enjoys good writing will find this book one that captures their  hearts and minds.	2000-05-25

I learned that  grossness sells.  The story was well told for the most part but the level  of sordid detail was not necessary to the story.  The ending was extremely  weak and I felt as though the author had read a &quot;how to&quot; book  that dictated all the loose ends must be dealt with before the reader  finishes the last page.  The ending was not satisfactory on any level.  The  book will do well with those readers who like the sordid killer mentality.   It may even be a good movie but the subject matter really turned me off.	2000-04-17

I do not understand how they can be so dismissive of such a well-written mystery.  The twists and turns would have kept any reader  interested even if they would for some unknown reason been turned off by  the poetic use of lanugage.  This story written by a 20 year conveying the  voice of a 70 year reminded me of the fact that a male author wrote the  exquisite Memoir of a Geisha.  That was a literary feat as is this book.  I  am looking forward to more works by this obviously talented and gifted  author.	2000-03-25
