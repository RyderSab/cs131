I know it sounds crazy but it yet again Patterson has produced another book that is very hard to put down. Cross as usual has many things going on. First is to stop the killings that are taking place in America. He is also have women problems, nothing out of the ordinary, in which he does not want another partner to meet their end at the hands of his rival, the Mastermind. Even though this book gets kind of vulgar in some spots it is hard to put it down and that is one theme that occurs throughout all of James Patterson's works.	2003-01-15

This book may anger certain readers with the frequent stereotypes used by Wolfe to show New York prejudice but they are essential in understanding New York city. I personally enjoyed the theme of how many whites were afraid of blacks and were scared to travel to what seems like another city in Harlem. Wolfe also addresses the situation within the poverty stricken ghettos of New York. This book paints an accurate picture of New York sex and class and the divisions within them.	2003-01-14

This book deals mainly with the threat that  censorship poses on a nation. Guy Montag, a fireman, has never had a problem going along with the norm until he meets a young girl who changes his perspective on life. He then begins to question why he burns books which leads him into trouble with his boss Fire Chief Beatty. There are many important lessons that one can draw from this book but mainly the idea that books never die and that they live on in people's hearts and minds as long as there lessons are remembered. This book can teach young people to appreciate the importance of books, a must read.	2003-01-05

But I was plesantly surprised after I finished reading it. Lou,  a little 12-year old girl, is funny and is very mature for her age. This book really shows how one must never give up because good things happen to those who wait. Lou and her little brother, Oz, move in with their great grandmother after certain things happen that leave them with no other options. I also enjoyed the work because it shows how life in rural America was during World War II.	2002-12-31

In Orwell's fictional world, communism rules the people in all aspects. People are not allowed to form their own ideas and even think for themselves. The story is raw and does not try to sugar up anything but rather show the horrors of living in this negative utopia. While reading this novel Orwell makes it very clear what he is trying to say. He is warning the world never to fall into hands of a communist state. This book should be read by all because it is an easy read and shows how novels can be instrumental in exposing the truth about important global issues.	2002-12-09

Although women were finding a role in the American workplace and society there were not many options for them.  As part of the struggle to escape poverty in New York City, prostitution became an increasingly viable choice for girls with out other alternatives. Historian Christine Stansell states, \\"It was both an economic and a social option, a means of self-support and a way to bargain with men in a situation where a living wage was hard to come by, and holding one's own in heterosexual relations was difficult.\\" This book deals with women in the factories as well as the working girls.

Through Baldwin's efforts, I feel that the black community made tremendous strides in seeing who they really were. Blacks during this time were taught to be ashamed of who they were but Baldwin taught them to embrace the heritage and to love being black. Along with other civil rights leaders Baldwin preached the belief to love your enemy. Baldwin left behind a blueprint for future generations of what can happen if one race ignores another race's needs and the chaos that can emerge from the ignorance.	2002-12-06

God is loving, merciful, and beautiful while he says that he is a warrior that is filled with anger towards his people. To me this is too much. He also makes claims that women were not a factor in many past movements and claims that men are the one's that always stop hate and evil in the world. But the fact is that women started the anti-slavery movement and also men were the ones that started the institution of slavery. This is just one example of women stopping slavery and men creating hate. He says that there are too many nice guys in the Christian world and he sees that as a bad thing. Nice does not equal weakness. But there are some good points which address the issue of standing up for what you believe in. This is a testostrone packed work.	2002-11-20

The book has many underlying themes and symbols throughout. It was difficult for me to draw the connections of the symbols to their meanings. While I read I had a hard time keeping up with the narritive because the scences changed rapidly. When I finished reading it I felt like I needed someone to come and explain all the symbolism used in the novel. However I do enjoy Morrison's descriptions of the city before and during the Harlem Reniassance and how jazz was an expression of Black's emotions during the time period. This was my first Morrison book and I was not too happy with the overall feeling I got but hopefully her other works are more clear cut.	2002-11-15

It was a great look into a society that we know so little about. While reading this book you can see how America begins to slip into slavery with the treatment of Africans on the Eastern Shore. Some pieces of the history of Virginia are missing but Breen and Innes do a great job with what they have to work with.	2002-09-23
