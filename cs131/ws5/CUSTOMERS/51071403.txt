Sequel to THE HUNDREDTH MAN, featuring the unusual duo detectives Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus in the Mobile, AL, PD . Due to the unusual moniker the two have been given - the psychopathological and sociopathological investigative team (PSIT) - they catch the weird case of a dead naked female in a seedy hotel - surrounded by candles and buried under flowers.  More bodies turn up - accompanied by with an oil painting.  Carson is contacted by a retired PD regarding the murders with the paintings, connecting it to an unsolved serial killer case.  This brings to light a whole new world of murder memorabilia - and once again involves Carson's brother.  I haven't read the first in the series - although I have it - and I didn't need it to thoroughly enjoy this novel - but I would have understood more of the undercurrents if I had.  Very well written and a great read.	2005-10-09

At least, her entire family seems to think so - anything happens, Pete - aka Peitra Lang - can take care of it.  That's why, in the midst of the celebrations surrounding her grandmother's funeral - I'll explain that later - the family doesn't worry about the dead body in the deep freezer.  Well, until the body disappears.  Pete figures the problem is gone - but her brother's lawyer says otherwise.  Pete is determined to throw the best party ever in memory of her grandmother, the matriarch of Langstown, but her family and Danny, the lawyer, keep distracting her.  Can she pull off the party AND find out who was in the freezer without marring her family's good name?  This is a cute romance, minor on the mystery.  A good distraction.	2005-10-09

Interesting to outsiders is the Sujosa's resistance to AIDS, so they are under a microscope that doesn't make them happy.  Faye encounters resistance from the site coordinator when she tries to set up a proper dig, not to mention outright hostility from the locals.  With Joe's help (hubba hubba!), she manages to get things on track, until the building housing the staff goes up in flames.  Faye manages to rescue one co-worker but another dies in the fire.  After that a local boy commits suicide, complicating the situation.  Joe sets out to track in ways only Joe knows how, and Faye uses her observation skills to help the fire marshall find clues to the arson, as well as using the copies of the work of her dead co-worker, an oral historian, had given her the night she died.  There are a lot of story lines in the mystery, but they are all intriguing and none detract from the main interests of the mystery.  Another wonderful mystery from a talented writer!	2005-10-02

The authorities are searching the river for the boy when they happen upon an old boat - with a skeleton.  Suddenly they are working on more than one case.   Luanne is trying to deal with her lover from the sheriff's office while at the same time trying to help her former lover recover from a diving accident, which is causing a little bit of tension.

Many search parties are on the case looking for the missing 5 year old, but the biggest discrepancy, in Evan's mind, is the lack of footprints in the sand around where Ashley was playing.  Elsewhere in the area there is a birthday party in the works, celebrating the 80th birthday of Tomos Thomas.  Unfortunately the missing Ashley brings an old case to the forefront of Evan's attention - the disappearance of Sarah, Tomos's granddaughter and Evan's playmate, who went missing 20 years ago.  Now all the suspects have returned to the area and another child is missing.  Evan works the case, although adjusting to his position in the Plainclothes Division is not as easy as it would seem.

This, obviously, places her in a very delicate position.  While Abby tries to help the police with a current case, she also is working out a way to not work for the mob, without letting either the police or the mob know of her involvement with the other.

Apparently the cornerstone was for protection.   I had a difficult time with this story - as much as I would like to like it, it was a little to technical for me - or maybe I didn't understand the way the magic works in that world, but I couldn't get into the story.  As with many of Luna's novels, the stories are hit or miss, even if the cover art and blurb are attractive.  There is a sequel called CURSE THE DARK.	2005-10-02

Their history boded well for them in this situation as they creep and crawl in and around the town to avoid the mysterious men with guns.  When they happen upon a pond full of floating dead cows, they don't know what to think.  In a strange series of events, the men piece together the missing pieces and ride to the rescue - which the women are close to getting anyway.

The St. Paul police detectives have been experiencing a lag in homicide in their city.  While they can appreciate the lack of crime, they are bored.  They quickly regret their boredom when bodies start piling up.  Bodies of the elderly - with no discernable connections.  At least, not at first.  Why was Morey Gilbert killed?  They can find no one who didn't love the man.  Using the new software created by Monkeewrench, the crew tries to connect the dots with any previous cases and current cases, but still coming up blank.  Grace continues to use the new software trying to help, especially the facial recognition features.  Slowly, the clues start to connect, but once again the mother/daughter team has built up a mystery that astounds.  Another great read.

This is a little bit more hard-boiled, first in the series, featuring Hoke Mosely, a detective in Miami.  Hoke smokes, drinks, swears, and eats whatever he wants (teeth or no teeth), so this obviously takes place in an earlier decade.  Hoke starts out investigating the death of a Hare Krishna at the International Airport, and winds up losing more things than one can count as well as connecting his investigation to a lot of odd twists and turns in the story.

Said son is with the father.  Spenser brings the son back, and then second-guesses his decision but lets it be.  But not for long.  Like I said, not a bad read, but not my first choice.

Dexter's struggles with his logical personality as questions his own sanity, and attempts to maintain a normal appearance at work and with family.

Mariana Morgan is a psychic healer, albeit a fairly new psychic.  She's only recently discovered her skills and is trying to develop them by starting her life over.  There are, apparently, previous books in the series, but I didn't realize this right away, and it definitely made this story a lot more difficult to understand without the previous information from those stories.  Mariana has a negative reading with Umberto Marconi, only to find him dead on the doorstep of the shop where she works after they close up shop, a shop which houses several different alternate healers.  LAPD detective David Claybourne keeps an open mind, at least enough to inquire with the alternate healers as to any knowledge they might have in regards to Marconi.  He keeps his eye on Mariana, as well.  I didn't particularly care for the characters or the writing, but it could be that I didn't like jumping into a series mid-stream.	2005-04-21

Following the death of his lifelong love - his wife - he retreats into the woods of British Columbia. Unfortunately the real world keeps interrupting. His old college roommate, Smelly, has shown up on his doorstep insisting on his help.  Smelly has had a timely arrival - Russell is contemplating joining his wife when Smelly knocks.  However, Smelly knows this - he's an incredibly gifted telepath - although early on, you realize that gifts are often curses, as well.  Russ finds himself investigating the future murder of a family, as well as a series of mass murders.  Smelly, on his island, in the middle of nowhere, 10 miles from the nearest human contact (for his sanity) has had access to the mind of a serial killer, who is also an unparalleled sadist. Unfortunately that is all he got - a brief glimpse - so Russ is floundering around searching for someone who might kill some family somewhere.   Russ is the only person whose mind doesn't damage Smelly's psyche; he's so sensitive he can't stand to be near people.  Russ enlists the aid of a skeptical police officer, and this trio may be the only ones who can catch the inhuman butcher.  This was an unusual paranormal mystery wasn't my usual fare, but it was interesting.  There was humor in it, as well, but I would have to classify it as Canadian humor - not something all US Americans would grasp.  The suspense is there, but there are times when you can predict the outcomes.  Smelly's character really comes thru - you can't imagine how he's survived this long.  At least, I can't, had he been real.	2005-04-21

Emerald, a medium, is a down-to-earth single mom raising her nerdy, star-gazing daughter and precocious son, who is also a medium while trying to run her china/tea shop where she also gives Tarot readings.  Emerald gets drawn into the investigation of a body found in the woods when her friend asks her to check it out for anything supernatural.  Emerald and her friends - and family - end up stumbling across a much greater mystery than anyone can imagine, while also laying the groundwork for future stories.  Most of you know how much I love my psychic stories, and this author is one of my favorites in the paranormal mysteries.  She can't seem to write quickly enough for me.

Coincidentally, Poe shows up on Final Jeopardy, Chapman and Alex's favorite competition.

If Derik doesn't do this, she sees a vision of the apocalypse.  But Sara has no idea that the fate of the world is in her hands or that she is an incarnation of the evil sorceress.  The hilarity in this comedic romance doesn't stop, especially when they set off to stop `the bad guys' - a cult that is trying to reincarnate King Arthur.  The humor is sharp and quick, although I prefer Davidson's `undead' series featuring Betsy, the Vampire Queen.  I will read anything by MaryJanice Davidson...I even have some of her YA books, published years ago.	2005-04-21

But who's haunting her with bloody messages???   <br /> <br />In Someone Else's Shadow by Barbara Hambly,   Maddie Laveau worries when Tessa, her roommate, stays late in the old Glendower Building.

When they both start hearing voices, Maddie questions her partner's motives.   <br /> <br />In Dancers in the Dark by Charlaine Harris, Layla Rue Le May is no ordinary dancer-her partner, Sean McClendon, is a three-hundred-year-old redheaded vampire. So when Layla Rue acquires a stalker, she's forced to face the music. . .and wonder if this will finally be her last dance.

Violets are rare, and have the natural ability to channel the spirits of those who are dead.  The government, of course, has jumped on this bandwagon to regulate this `gift', and there is a `School' for the violets to attend once the dead start `knocking'.  The story begins with Natalie Lindstrom, a Violet, testifying in a murder trial.  FBI agent Dan Atwater is supposed to bring Natalie in on a case that is close to home for her - a serial killer has targeted Violets.

She tries to save a child who also lives thru the attack, but the winter conditions, combined with injuries and Tess' amnesia, find her carrying a dead child when she is found by Archer, an immortal.  Unable to separate the two, Archer takes her to an Inn nearby to recover.  Tess eventually remembers her name and gets her voice back, and decides to stick with Archer and his friends to find the band that attacked Tess' traveling group.  A few more villagers join the group (total 6), and they wonder at the magic that is chasing Tess and driving the weather out of season.  Tess can hear the mage calling her, and they follow the trail into danger.  There is a wonderful balance of romance, mystery, and fantasy in this story, and I look forward to more from Rachel.

Dubric is head of security at Faldorrah's castle & keep.  Unfortunately for Dubric, he is cursed.  As a young man, he turned his back on his goddess, and was rewarded with the ability to see the ghosts of murdered people - usually ones only in his vicinity.  Unfortunately, the ghosts don't leave unless Dubric finds out how they died, why, and who did it.  No one in the castle knows of Dubric's dark secret, until a serial killer strikes at under Dubric's domain.  As the bodies pile up, so do the ghosts.  And the longer the ghosts are there, the more dangerous they become.  To make Dubric's life more difficult, everything points to the king's grandson...who also happes to be in love with one of the servants. <br />  <br />I found this book in the sci fantasy section of the bookstore - drawn by the fabulous cover art, reeled in by the initial description of Dubric and his ghosts.  There are some paranormal elements to this story - magic is a known entity in the times where this is set.  However, I found this to be more of a murder mystery with paranormal elements than a outright fantasy.  This is not a story for those with a weak stomach, by the way.

I Love that she has started a new series, and looked eagerly for the second Grace &amp; Favor mystery.  She is developing the characters wonderfully, and I  am awaiting her next novel just as eagerly as her second!	2000-06-26

I enjoyed the plot and, as usual, the characters, but it doesn't seem like there was much different from Ms. Dereske's other novels with Ms. Zukas. Gotta love Ruth!	2000-01-10
