The author painted a vivid image of a setting, his characters were really credible, even though the character of Sam was slightly overdone. The plot was really well constructed and it was breath taking. In addition the novel was well researched, indeed the author did a very thorough research and he was able to avoid being a teacher. Great novel, great story telling. I am sure I want to read more novels by him. I would give the book 7 stars, but there are only five available.	2005-10-08

Dark state institutions working in the underground and who pursue their \\"political\\" aims even at the cost of deception and murder with the support of people in the highest places, settings that range from the Arctic ice fields to the warm, shark infested waters of the Atlantic Ocean, and the dangerous jungles of Washington DC, and a handful of brave characters that fight the evil constitute a breathtaking plot with exciting twists and unexpected turns. There is one minor flaw though: the heroes' incredible ability to survive is not realistic. But it is fiction after all and that is why we read thrillers like this, don't we?	2004-12-03

This was my feeling when reading their other novels. And I have read them all. But the \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" has topped all of them. It is by far their best book, if not the best book of this genre I have ever read. The weird character of agent Pendergast alone makes this novel worth reading. Although he is one of the goodies his unusual outer appearance, his weird behaviour and superhuman control of himself even in extremis make him a genuine member of the family of horror characters. The scenes in the NY Museum of Natural history, in its archive, in the apartment in China Town, even those in Central Park, and above all the showdown give this novel the quality of an outstanding gothic horror novel. Moreover, the authors meticulously created a magnificent plot, and a sombre atmosphere that constantly gives their readers the creeps and that you would not expect in the middle of the modern city of New York. <br /> <br />This book is an absolute must for all aficionados of true horror novels, <br />	2004-10-04

And I enjoyed reading it. But there is a major flaw: its psychology. It is not really conceivable that the lawyer of the alleged murderer falls in love with her adversary, the lawyer who represents the prosecution. In the courtroom they fight against each other using more or less unfair methods and tricks. Then they go to bed and do not speak a single word about the case. The characters of the alleged killer's wife and his father - among others - are not credible in their action and motivation either.<br />But if you do not mind this, you can read a novel with a fine plot and in addition a well worked out setting that shows more realism than the characters.	2004-05-25

If you like it here is an interesting and suspenseful novel - with two minor flaws in it. The setting of 17th century Europe is seen from a very American angle. Although the major historical facts are quite correct, their evaluation is sometimes too modern and slightly distorts the historical reality and characters. For example: a Swedish officer uses a comparison between  a chipmunk and a bear when he watches two other characters. He certainly was not able to use this image as there are no chipmunks at all in Europe. And exactly this mistake leads to another one. All the characters seem very credible as individual personalities. But the natives become less credible when they so readily and quickly accept modern political, technical, and economical concepts that are so alien to them that they must create strong conflicts in this mixed society. Modern western democracy is a political concept that nobody - even the poor and suppressed people of that era - would have accepted then. Something like that developed in centuries, not in days.<br />But this novel is fiction after all, and, of course, the author is free to use his imagination as freely as he may find it suitable. It is the result that counts, and the result is a very good and exiting novel.	2004-03-08

And it proves to be a novel that again shows Bob Meyer's tremendous writing skills, his expertise in creating suspense, and his careful historic research. All this combined results in another great book in the series. The best is the Custer-plot. It is really convincing and exciting. But I think the Earhart/Dane plot is just a little bit slow this time and cannot catch up with the story of Custer's defeat. But go ahead and read this book. It is very good. But make sure you have read the other novels of the series first.	2003-12-20

He wrote a novel full of suspense after having done his homework in research very well. Over the last twenty years or so the topos of the magician's apprentice who uses his wand without considering the possible - and often disastrous - results of his doings has become a classic in modern stories. And this happens frequently when corporations are too profit-orientated to analyse implicit future dangers that may result from their new technological projects and when they accept possible dangers for the lives of people - or on a larger scale the destruction of mankind. Logically the novel's ending is ambiguous. It is the reader's choice whether he wants to be an optimist or a pessimist in these issues.<br />The characters - above all the narrator Jack - are well constructed to help the development of the novel and the understanding of a rather complex subject. There are minor flaws in the story's plot, though. Some twists in the action are not really logical. Why is Jack called in to help when he is a potential danger for those who call him? Why does his wife not kiss him at the beginning of the novel? OK, OK, it would have been a completely different story. But a plot has to be logical after all.<BR>Nevertheless I have enjoyed reading the book, I liked the story and I can recommend it to all those who are interested in modern technology and its possible dangers.	2003-12-05

The main character, Nathaniel Lee, is as charismatic as you can only imagine it in a living person. Plot and theme are just as fascinating. This is a book about history - one thinks. But it is not. It is an epos about mankind itself, about our greatness and littleness in face of existential dangers, about perspectives that might destroy us or that might elevate us, about minions and heroes, about crooks and saints.

But this book is different. It confirms all - mainly British - prejudices about Germany and - this is unfair - makes the US part of it. Only Great Britain seems to be the root of democracy. It might have slipped Easterman's mind that the English invented the concentration camps when they fought against South Africa's independence. And they fought against a lot of peoples who wanted to be independent from the Great British Rule. I have always been a fan of Easterman's.

On the cover of the book someone writes it is a page burner - this is still too weak a characterization of what this novel really is. It leads us into a fantasy world that is very similar to ours populated by very credible characters and fantastic beings that, in their interactions, create most exciting and breathtaking plots. The idea of a sub-planet is not a new one, with Jules Verne being one of the first authors to lead us down there. But this novel is one of the most sophisticated ones I have ever read. It is not only that Long has thoroughly researched human history to create a dark background for his yarn, it is also the language, its rich imagery that is never ridiculous, and the powerful language that he uses, which force you to read the book in one go. Never is there a boring line in 561 long pages. <BR>If you ask about the genre this novel belongs to, the answer is not easy: There is some SF, some fantasy, a lot of horror, and also mainstream. So you would imagine this could be a book for everybody to read. But beware: those who are afraid of blood and gore should think twice before reading it - although the book would be nothing without that. A page burner indeed!	2003-06-14

Unlike one of the critics I find this book was written by a very intelligent and gifted author, a master of stylistic means and rich imagery that makes the reading of this book a real pleasure. But this is not the only reason why this book is perfectly written. Tanenbaum's feeling for \\"plot\\" is enormous. The constant twists in the actions, the characters' conflicts with each other and in themselves result in a remarkable novel full of suspense. And this book contains some criticism of the legal system: it is not about justice, but a legal Darwinism is described, in which the lawyer is considered a failure who is not able to play the jury as well as his opponent. Justice is of no importance. I recommend this book to everybody who appreciates a well written thriller. I will read more of Tanenbaum's books!	2003-04-23

But a book has to inspire its readers for the whole length of it, not only for the last 100 or so pages, when the story finally picks up some speed. Long dialogues and descriptions are alright when they contribute to the development of the plot, but they are not a value in itself, as which we can see them here very often. The characters may be conceivable, but their actions are slow and sometimes their motivation remains in the dark. Often the descriptions of the circumstances blur your imagination rather than make things clear.The fact that there is no ending makes me fear there will be sequel. I am not sure I will read it.	2003-04-23

But is there anything that has not already been said in the first two novels? Prot's view of the world does not change, the narrator's view of prot and doubts about him either. So Gene Brewer concentrates on Robert's secret and the reader is interested only in the question whether prot is an alien or whether all this might be a case of multiple personality as suggested in the first two novels. It would have been a good idea to solve the problem at the end of book II.<br />This is a good example that it is not always worth while squeezing another book out of a good idea. Of, course, all those who liked the first two sequels buy the third book, but the question is whether they are satisfied after reading it. I admit, it is still amusing and reflective at the same time, so buying the book was no waste of money. But as you know: sometimes less is more.	2003-03-09

In a way I needed a break after reading most of King's novel. After the break I read his more recent books \\"Tom Gordon\\" and \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" first. But reading \\"Insomnia\\" reminded me of his first novels and their incredibly suspenseful plots. King is a real master of suspense. The only minor flaw you can criticize in this novel is that the final climax is too long. As a reader you cannot keep your breath for such a long time, and this is exactly where suspense can turn into its opposite. But King is at his best when it comes to characters. Most of the people he develops are so real you think you have known them for years. They are characters you have seen and talked to all your life. In addition, the author is brilliant in the presentation of the dark sides of the human soul and mind. In this novel we have all of it and this makes it one of King's greatest.	2003-01-18

Not only did he do a particularly good job in his research for this book, he also created believable characters and a plot full of suspense. The underlying idea is quite original, even though author's like Greg Donovan have walked on similar paths. but Pavlou treats his subject in a completely different way. He is more a hard core SF writer than a writer of fantasy. This may scare some mainstream readers off, but it is good food for all SF aficionados and, if mainstream readers are not too limited in their perception, they will find a novel that deals with our culture and the history of mankind on a highly educated level. It is sometimes slow food, though. Pavlou is a master of suspense for the most part of the novel, but in some passages he is too much in love with his scientific explanations and his descriptions of cultural backgrounds. And the final climax is just a little bit too lengthy. A few pages less would have done the book some good. But all in all this novel makes us welcome a new, very talented writer on the SF stage. I am looking forward to Stel's coming novel.	2003-01-01

The novel combines the qualities of the good old Gothic horror novel with the action thriller of today. And the author has created an excellent combination here.

The plot is set at different times and places as usual. What I liked best this time is the character of the Spartan King Leonidas who the author developed with care and understanding. Of course, again it is a fight between good and bad, of bad superpowers and \\"weak\\" men who can only defend themselves against an anonymous timeless enemy by using extraordinary ingenuity, which makes them stronger than they think they are. On the time level of 480 B.C. this is mirrored by Leonidas' self-denying bravery and the absolute wickedness of Xerxes. <BR>I, myself, this novel has a finale that could be a worthy ending to the series. Sure, this ending is in no way final. The author left some questions unanswered, the Shadow is still somewhere, and this could lead to a sequel. A would have preferred a definite ending and I do not think another novel is really necessary.

At the beginning the threats are vague and Delaware's fear somewhat ridiculous, but when the reader learns about a series of mysterious deaths the situation for Alex becomes more and more real. Alex's paranoia is very credibly turned into real and explicable fear. This time the author does not use dramatic irony, but the reader is kept in the dark up to a traumatizing finale. Whereas the action of the novel is getting faster by the page the peak of the climax is a bit too long. It reminds us of the endless sessions and explanations of Agatha Christie novels. Also, the denouement is not too logical, but as psychopaths are involved this does not disturb a lot. All in all, the book is pretty exciting and a good read. By the way, I did not miss the thorough descriptions of Alex's private problems in this books. On the contrary, their absence adds to the pleasure of reading the book.	2002-08-24

This civilization is doomed because man is an egoistic - therefore destructive - being: he destroys his environment, kills animals and his own kind alike (in wars, in personal conflicts), and as a social being he rather wants to hurt others than live in peace with them, or he is simply indifferent; as a consequence he will destroy if not EARTH, but at least his own kind. This is why the \\"normal\\" people should be locked up in psychiatrist institutes, not the people that are now locked up in there, because they were broken by this world and society and reduced to vegetables and autists. I rate this novel a five star novel, not because I agree with its general message in its absolute, or better, radical meaning. But as in the first book the author - or is it prot? - does not try to teach us. He manages to describe the confrontation of ideas and concepts of life (or survival?) in a very humorous way. This makes it easy for us to think about our social and individual defects, and we do not adopt a radical anti-position. Because in some of his statements prot is right after all.	2002-08-11

This one is definitely one of his best. His characters are well developed. The plots that he creates are thoroughly interwoven and lead to an excellent and very exciting climax. Of course, the characters are not realistic, Koontz does not want them to be. The monster father is too monstrous, the nine-year-old girl speaks like a fifty-year-old woman and the aliens are not of this world anyway, the Hollywood twins are too much like super James Bonds. Therefore the author creates a mix of genres (SF, Horror, mainstream, philosophical novel) which allows him to convey his message in different ways. He also breaks with the tradition that we frequently find that beauty comes along with goodness and vice versa. Beauty here is no concept of the mind, you can never be sure about a character. Nothing is real, but in the concert of the different characters, good and bad, before the background of a very realistic setting the message becomes very real, and we look into the abysses of the human mind and soul as well as at examples of goodness in some humans (and dogs). And we see all beings as parts of a larger context and concept. I see a minor flaw in the fact that the author sometimes is too much in love with his own imagery, so that it often becomes somewhat redundant and disturbs the advancement of the plot. The same is true for his philosophising. <BR>But this novel is Koontz' first real attempt at serious literature and the attempt has been successful!	2002-08-04

But this novel is even more thrilling. Rarely have I read such a gripping tale, the plot is breathtaking in its turns and twists. I disagree with some of the critics: the characters are believable. They may be stereotypes in a way, a journalist is a journalist, a soldier is a soldier etc., but I think they are of flesh and blood and very conceivable. <BR>Meyer likes to pick up ancient and modern myths and give them a new fictitious meaning and it is always exciting when esoteric theories are turned into SF-thrillers, or inexplicable phenomena are explained by using the unlimited fantasy that fiction allows. For all those who like this kind of writing, this book is an excellent read.	2002-07-25

This book expects a high degree of technical, cultural and scientific education from its readers. But those who appreciate contemplation and a deeper approach to characters that are doubt-torn when they ask about the sense of their existence will have exactly a story they enjoy in their hands. It is very fitting that in the discussion about the question if there is a creator or not the protagonist is a dying man. His character, his despair, his unanswered questions and his doubts are all too credible. The book has a - minor - flaw, though: its ending. Of course, it is technically difficult to make a dying man end his story. But here, in comparison with the whole quiet and contemplative story before, the ending seems pompous - and vague at the same time. I did not expect answers to the questions discussed in the book, but in the end everything is drifting into nowhere, and this is a bit disappointing.<BR>Nevertheless, it is a very interesting and in a way a pleasantly saddening novel that shows us how really unimportant we are.	2002-07-25

You meet the old, familiar characters - you even have a certain feeling that you have already read about Lucas Davenport having a similar problem. But, nevertheless, again Sandford has managed to produce a real page-turner. In spite of the dramatic irony used here the novel is full of suspense. And the ending again shows the same pattern: Lucas has to struggle very hard to find the last and convincing piece of evidence. But why is it that you always like those novels by Sandford? Because he is a great writer who can play with a suspenseful plot, and even the dja vu feeling you always have here does not make this a bad book - on the contrary. This is the positive routine of writing - completely enjoyable!<BR>But: statistically the Twin Cities must be the place with the most serial murderers in the world.	2002-06-21

As a doctor she must be intelligent enough to judge people - at least rudimentary. As usual Cook's men are more realistic characters. The plot is very realistic - as we know now. And this is why the ending is a little disappointing. Maybe Cook was afraid of his own courage when looking into the future. We have to be prepared. This novel is not only highly political, reality has even overtaken fiction. This is why this novel should be read by those responsible for our security. Maybe they see the nightmare that is hinted at here.	2002-06-03

The readers interest is mainly centred on who wants to destroy Tempe and what may be wrong with this foot. But the author takes her time until we see any considerable progress. But then there is recompense. Suddenly the story gets faster and faster until it reaches a breathtaking climax. The last part makes the book a very good read, I admit. Whereas Tempe is very believable as a character, the baddies are not very conceivable, their motivation on the borderline of becoming ludicrous. But the metamorphosis from a mystery to a genuine horror story gives the novel some exciting elements. Unusual but interesting!	2002-05-23

You can read this book very quickly due to the fact that its style is rather simple and understandable - but then: the story is very interesting as well. It is questionable if this novel is an SF novel at all as advertised. But, nevertheless, it uses a key feature of many SF stories: contrast. Everything, code of values, customs, lifestyle etc that seems so normal to us here on Earth is the exact opposite on K-PAX. The generally accepted on Earth is impossible on the - imaginary? - planet K-PAX and vice versa. So we see ourselves in a mirror. But the well-meaning know-all of a psychiatrist who tells the story does not. This is why his belief in human values very often turns into a lame and weak defensive argumentation, and he himself is the mirror that shows us the defects of our bourgeois society, with his family and their troubles as a most effective and a demonstrative background. But the author never leaves the path of humor, he never moralizes, never points at us in an insulting way. And this is what makes this book interesting, revealing and amusing at the same time.	2002-05-01

But: most of the positive characteristics of this novel are destroyed by long and boring philosophising. I really am not a friend of action and action only, but Barnes reflects too often and too much. And the whole subject of Occitan culture may be interesting for those who know about the old troubadour tradition, but the ordinary reader is certainly confused by it. His characters are believable in this Occitan context, but most of the readers have never come in touch with even the theoretical basis of a society like this. It may be interesting for the expert to discuss the oppositional viewpoints of a fundamental Protestant society with all its hypocrisy and a society that has its basis in artificial codes of honor and dignity. But both are far away from reality. And that is why they do not reflect any social problem in reality. Both should have been opposed to a realistic society of today, of course alienated from the here and now by science fiction settings. This is what science fiction is about. But here this novel discusses some theoretical problems and never arrives in reality. Some critics call Barnes a descendant of Robert Heinlein. Well, if so, he has still a long way to go.	2002-04-04

The two characters are very different and alike at the same time. And it is not really a confrontation. Both guarantee that the story is again very exciting. Connelly has been known as an author who is one of the best when it comes to giving life to very sophisticated characters, and two of them in a book make it all the more readable.<BR>But apart from the two individuals the author focuses on a more general problem: a cop who may take justice in his own hands because the legal system has obviously failed. And I do not see any problem with Harry Bosch's being in the center of interest in this respect as we have already seen some of the darker sides of his character in other books. We as readers are not married to this hero and have to keep our distance as to any other person in real life. Anything might be possible.<BR>Nor do I have a problem with the fact that McCaleb is watched a bit more closely by the author. He is as interesting a character as Bosch, and, in fact, I would like to read more about him. <BR>In contrast to other reviews I feel the courtroom scenes in this book are very revealing because between the lines we can observe the author when he criticizes scenes that show that for quite a few people a courtroom is not a place of justice but a wooden and old-fashioned stage for egocentrics who do not care at all about justice.<BR>I, personally, am looking forward to the next Connelly novel. I am sure it will be another thrilling experience.	2002-03-07

The ambitious plans Silverberg works out in the introduction turn out to become a real bore. Most stories are sedatives rather than stories, above all Silverberg's own contribution. It is not so much that I miss action, but if there are contemplative passages they have to be interesting and discuss themes of interest and relevance. Good science fiction always has to mirror reality and its problems in a way, and doing so it must not just play with a given subject, but has to involve the reader and take sides. And of course, stories need real plots - and some action after all. But telling most of these stories Scherazade would have been killed right after the first night.<BR>There are some exceptions, though. Ursula Le Guin's yarn is quite good, but we have seen better stories from her. The same is true for Frederik Pohl's story. Dan Simmons wrote an acceptable tale, but those three are not worth laboring through 577 long and slow pages.	2002-01-30

This one is on the one hand pretty simple as far as the action is concerned. But the plot is not really conceivable, the events are sometimes too far away from any acceptable reality, the psychology is more related to that of a Sidney Sheldon novel than to that of a professional. The ending is illogical, and the origins and the upbringing of Sharon are simply improbable. <BR>But nevertheless, the story is suspenseful and by no means boring. But this is the only credit I can give it. Kellerman has done a lot better in his other books - at least those I know. He may be forgiven this one.	2002-01-10

He is always at his best when the setting is the wilderness of Maine and when he describes and follows characters with social, mental or physical defects. We find all of these in this novel. The alcoholic, the mentally retarded victim of stupid bullies, the suicidal intellectual, and the teacher who has had a close encounter with death and who is still suffering psychologically. They are accompanied by an inhuman sociopath who personifies the old American trauma of anonymous administrative powers gone wild, which seek to destroy the liberty and life of the individual. Together with aliens that want to conquer this world after several attempts this mixture of characters guarantees a plot of utmost suspense, unexpected turns and a constant compulsion to read on and on. <BR>King is also at his best when he writes about friends, about what ties them together and when they as ordinary and often weak people become heroes. This motif of his has fascinated us in \\"It\\" and \\"The Body\\" and others. Here we find a new variation of the theme. <BR>Although the novel is very long I read it in record time and was disappointed when I came to the end. Not that there would be need for a sequel, but my fascination was still switched on after the last lines. <BR>Who cares that there are some minor faults (fault is too strong a word, actually)? King is often a bit too talkative, which makes some passages just a wee lengthy. The solution of the alien plot is a bit too vague and even for the aficionado not exactly plausible. But as I said, who cares? The master has deserved his five stars. Absolutely!	2002-01-03

The whole book concentrates more and more on the war between the Marines and China, and nothing else. As readers we have been waiting for three books, and then we only get a few lines of information about the aliens/ancestors at the end. The Alpha Centauri plot in the middle of the novel ends abruptly and is never continued.The good action and story of vols. 1 and 2 has now been institutionalised and the fighting gets boring. It is not conceivable that the nations on Earth would behave like this in face of such an enormous discovery. Maybe this book is the preparation of volume four, money has frequently generated trilogies with more than 3 volumes. But if this is the case, we as readers expect more tension and more substance.

The author knows how to get a grip on his readers. The fast action, unexpected turns, credible characters make this novel an example of good writing.<BR>But in opposition to this the political setting as the background to this story is improbable and inconceivable as it is based on national stereotypes and unnecessary jingoism. Never during the whole novel does the author explain why one side really fights the other. It is not a fight good vs. bad. It's a fight of nations the author seems to like and nations he does not care for. Never during the whole novel do we get to know why the \\"UNers\\" act as they do - their motives virtually remain in the dark. Consequences like religious unrest and radical sects in Western Europe are not realistic arguments, and someone who knows a bit more of the world than the author, may conclude that America could be more endangered in this respect than Europe. Does Douglas really believe a scenario like this could really be possible in nations of the Western hemisphere?<BR>The political situation at this very moment strongly suggests the contrary. The people who work against truth and human progress are to be found elsewhere. This book is a good example of the fact that novels and stories have to be founded on excellent research, political insight and psychologically realistic scenarios if they want to be really good. Maybe Douglas should have had a closer look at \\"Star Trek\\" to find out how to create a serious background for Science Fiction Stories, and better even, he should have read Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Oh, but this is only fiction, some will say. True enough! But if fiction wants to be relevant, wants to mirror the world as it is, it has to weigh certain possibilities, above all when the setting the author chooses is seemingly a realistic one.<BR>But, dear reader, go ahead and read the book - it is full of suspense. But do not let yourself get manipulated by cheap clichs.	2001-10-27

It seems as if Kellerman was still practicing then. He did not create the convincing characters we can find in his later novels when he wrote this book. And the plot is a little heavy, too. The climax is somewhat forced and improbable and comes before the actual ending, which is too transparent and obvious. We know exactly what is coming.

The most delicate themes of \\"sexual harassment\\" and \\"mobbing\\" simply invite authors to write about them. And I have read a lot of trash and cheap voyeurism concerning these subjects. Not here. Like in \\"Rising Sun\\" the research for this novel was outstanding and this resulted in an excellent plot with a logical, inevitable line of events and a breathtaking speed. The characters and, I am afraid, the plot are all too credible and they reflect reality more than a lot of people would like to admit. It is not disturbing then that the final twist of action has somewhat of the deus ex machina technique, because the ending is not what is really interesting. The most interesting thing is that events like this can happen (actually happen) and that they are in a way even legal. Crichton writes about the effects of laws that are fine with us in theory and well meant by the legislator. But once they are exposed to reality human nature corrupts them and brings about more injustice, they even awake the beast in man (and women, too!!). <BR>When you begin to read this novel make sure you have enough time to read it in one go!	2001-10-11

It is the report of a Little League baseball season, when the author accompanies his 12-year-old son and his team in the local championships.

It is really disturbing to find two completely unrealistic characters - superman (good) and superman (bad) - in a realistic setting. Both supermen never make mistakes, well, not really. But they move in a world that is quite normal, and this makes part of the action improbable or simply unrealistic. The placement of the second bomb cannot be realistic; a highly sophisticated device like this cannot be organized and placed within a couple of hours. But superman (bad) can do it - easily. The constantly deceiving tactics of superman (bad) cannot be predicted or even guessed at. There are always several - realistic - possibilities thinkable. But superman (good) finds the right one - easily. And how can somebody murder eight US Marshals within minutes - sometimes noisily - without the people staying in the same house noticing anything? The author should have given the novel a fantasy setting and written about witchcraft and telepathy, but this story is not believable as it is. I admit, it is never boring, but because of the flaws I described it always a bit annoying.	2001-08-09

He wrote a pageturner that is soft and subtle and, nevertheless, you cannot lay this book down. You work yourself into the mystery with the characters, and Dr. Delaware is at his best here, with a splendid Milo at his side.

It is very imaginable that people in their prejudiced ignorance behave as it is described in the novel, that authorities act against their better knowledge and follow populist motivations. But after a very good beginning, the novel just loses its energy. This may be partly due to the fact that we have a hard-core sf-novel here and the scientific explanations are somewhat lengthy at times. I am not an expert, but I always understood the general idea of what Bear explained. Why did he not go the simple way and emphasize the action a little more as he did at the beginning and cut out the scientific bla-bla that no one is interested in, at least not for the story's sake? In addition, he changed from a more global point of view to a very private one, with the effect that the dramatic evolutionary change gets somehow lost on the reader. A drama important to all mankind becomes a tiny little problem of a family. Bear should have introduced more \\"cases\\" and described the cruelty of the masses explicitly to keep the drama up. But he chose to let the story trickle very slowly at the end. So there is absolutely no climax where we should expect one. In contrast to one of the other critics I would not mind a sequel, but it should show more action and suspense.	2001-06-28

Like in the old times when we read &quot;It&quot;, &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;  the &quot;Tommknockers&quot; and more of the kind. So the five stars are a must. But one thing has changed. King's writing has matured, if I am allowed to say this. His characters are flesh and blood, and the setting - his Maine - is full of real life. The Yankees are described after long and meticulous observation of the different types, the author looks at them and their pecularities with love, affection, understanding. But he never loses his critical distance. The supernatural elements blend in the novel very naturally. Without it the novel would not be &quot;realistic&quot;. And he writes in the tradition of the great regionalists, he would be one of their best. Maybe this is why he keeps quoting and mentioning Thomas Hardy in this novel. There may be one little thing that some readers might see a little negative: very often King is carried away by his love of writing and this gives some length to a couple of passages. But those who know him grant him generous pardon. Well done! I am waiting for the next in the row.	2001-06-06

I would not say this book is bad, but it is not great either. In those novels the characters were credible and the plot was very well developed. Here the characters of Chark, Adelia and most of the other horse racing professionals are stereotype, clumsy and wooden in their presentation. Chark and Adelia are hardly characters of flesh and blood. The plot is not of the same quality as the plots of the other books I have read. The solution does not come as a surprise, but like in a classical English soap mystery you accept it, but the development of the plot does not help you to sharpen your qualities as a detective. It is not logical and you'd rather not think much about it. Because there is no argumentation that necessarily leads to the ending. The animals are too intrusive and their &quot;help&quot; a little too erratic as well. So on the whole this novel is readable, but it is not a pageturner and not as hilarious a story as the other ones I have read.	2001-05-06

Because, by our standards, we only have baddies here. Cassie is a thief, Karch is a killer. The law is virtually non-existing in this book. But isn't this as it is in reality? How many cases have to be left open by the police? Or how many cases never even get recorded by the police?  We have here a detective novel without detectives. So what? This time Connelly is not interested in the psyche of a cop, like Bosch or McCaleb, but in the thoughts and emotions of criminals. And this results in a more or less open manipulation of the readers. We take sides with a thief, we want her to have success, and we want her to get away. And we enjoy being manipulated, too. The moralist question why or if Cassie gets away with what she has done is secondary and hypocritical. Our sympathy with her shows that we all have our darker social sides. And we'd better accept this because this helps us to control ourselves and to better suppress antisocial urges in ourselves.<br />An excellently written book - as always.	2001-04-26

We enter a bizarre world when we visit the institution for insane criminals with Alex and Milo. And Kellerman planned his plot carefully when he made this setting the main background to his novel. We are as frustrated as Milo and Alex at first when they know this world must play a decisive part in the solution of their case, but they cannot find it. When the author is slowly unravelling his story we do not find its supense in the ordinary whodunnit but in how will the two detectives find out what was really happening. Guessing at who the real monster is is not really difficult and it is not the intention of the novel to keep us in the dark à la Agatha Christie. The way, the methods how to close a case is much more interesting. And here the author did a great job.<br />In addition there is also some remarkable political criticism in this book: in showing that institutions like this usually develop their own dynamics and separate themselves from the real world we must ask ourselves if they are in any way helpful or necessary. Might there be other solutions? Kellerman shows when depicting the director and his colleagues that even the &quot;sane&quot; people in this institution no longer belong to the real world. At the same time we know - and it is demonstrated in the novel - that the real monsters often run free.<br />I will certainly read more Kellerman novels.	2001-04-26

This story is based on real facts, but like  Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; it is a novel. And an excellent one, too. The novel reminds us somehow of a report in a magazine or a newspaper written in several sequences and appearing over a certain period of time. Here we are right at the Victorian way of writing: Dickens used to write his novels this way. Stephen King has tried to revive this art several times, beginning with &quot;The Green Mile&quot;. But Crichton did it in the genuine way. Not only did he write about the Victorians but he also tried to reflect their style. <br />He mixed reality and fiction in a very delicate way, so you have always the impression that everything is real in this story, even the dialogues the author could not find recorded. His research of the era was thorough, and so his characters and the setting are genuine. In addition he wrote a very suspensful story, not exactly a pageturner (thrillers had not been invented back then), but a very interesting and attractive book for modern people. The subject is timeless, though: How can I get at other people's money without being caught?<br />A very good book, indeed!	2001-04-26

The time it takes before the plot gets under way may be the time when some impatient people stop reading and turn to another book. But from then on, let us say from page 150 , this novel is excellent. The characters are very well developed, the plot foreseeable as the author works with dramatic irony from the start, but the suspense does not feed on the question: What will happen? but on: How will the characters get out of this mess? or: Will this villain be punished after all? And Koontz manages to give the plot some nice unexpected twists that keeps your interest alive. <br />What is always enjoyable in Koontz' books is his expertise in dogs, especially in golden retrievers.

You can understand that someone gets lost in a vast ocean of trees and animals and evil spirits as it happens to Trisha. It is possible that search parties do not find a single person in this maze, and it is possible to fight for your life in an ordeal like this - even if you are only nine years old. Nature is your friend - but then it is also your enemy, it can help you survive and it can kill you. Even as an adult you would have to fight. You have to fight a merciless environment, and you have to fight yourself and the ghosts that try to kill you, the ghosts you imagine and those that haunt the woods, bears or real ghosts - who cares? So don't forget \\"a compass and good maps\\" as the master says. It may be vital.<br />A very good read, a genuine horror thriller.	2001-03-09

This book is a real pageturner again and it kept me hooked from the first to the last page. The characters of Dane, Foreman et al. remain consistent in their presentation and have kept up our interest now for three books. And I want to read more. I disagree with the same critic when he or she says there should be a real ending to the book. Unlike in other stories where authors and/or editors try to lengthen stories by postponing the final showdown or solution to another book this novel has an ending. Most of the main characters have served their purposes and the battle has been fought - for now. But not the war! Like in the real world we will have to wait. Fighting this enemy cannot be solved in 300 pages. There must be another novel here. And I am waiting for it.<br />I again liked the fine mixture of fantasy and SF, both the modern world and the ancient worlds fighting the same allegoric war against possible extinction of the world that has been threatening mankind, the world, species for as long as life has existed. And of course the well researched historical parts are very attractive, but I liked the way the author treated the modern world that is lacking the superstitions of the ancient times and with its insistence on facts. These people are able to explain some of the physical background of the threat, but like the scientifically illiterate ancient people, they do not understand the threatening powers at all. Nothing has changed. Man has remained the same throughout the ages. <br />We are looking forward to the sequel.	2001-03-02

Coming from the Harry Bosch novels I thought I would miss this remarkable character - just to see him replaced by an equally remarkable one. And what a plot! It is complex and twisted, indeed. But the reader always knows what McCaleb knows, and in opposition to most mysteries, understands what is going on, and can easily follow the main character's reasoning. Although the former FBI agent is an &quot;exotic&quot; character because of his recent heart transplant he is credible as a literary character and seems genuine and real. All the other persons are credible too and even the sick mind of the bad guy appears genuine and imaginable. A great book!	2001-02-20

The idea of a criminal exploitation of people that in their need lose their critical distance toward their &quot;helpers&quot; is old but gains new dimensions in modern, highly sophisticated sciences, above all in the field of modern medicine. The author develops his action without revealing too much at one time, and thus he creates considerable tension. But his characters are weak, as one of the other readers has already stated. In addition, Langello's language lacks inspiration and a vivid imagery. This makes the novel seem a dry report rather than the lively presentation of a good story that involves the reader emotionally. It would be a real pageturner, if Langello had used the appropriate style and creative stylistic devices. Maybe Langello should have a closer look at the language of Stephen King, Robert McCammon, or Dean Koontz and others. He could learn there how to technically write a story that really excites its readers. With the kind of language as is used in this novel this is not the case. So the admittedly good story remains somewhat stale and dull.	2001-02-10

Those who do not like this novel too much expect a thriller to be just that: a thriller. They perhaps do not want to be reminded of the fact that a good author - and Michael Connelly is excellent - does not write novels that exclude reality, even when it means that this reality is sad and disappointing. But Connelly does put his plot in the real world with its real problems. And this is why this book is so good. And this is why the novel is a very political novel, and a very pessimistic one. Very often it is not the truth that the authorities are after, but their first interest is to survive politically. In the most delicate field of racism this attitude becomes even more apparent than in just normal homicide cases. In describing this Connelly can prove that he is a first rate author - second to almost none in his field. We want our authors to mirror reality and comment on it. It is not the world of easy thrillers with their black and white view of human nature, which has always been wrong and which turns good plots into bad novels.<br />But the novel has also qualities of a real thriller: it is a page turner, so full of suspense that you cannot lay the book down. Its characters - even the superficially contradictory ones - are full-fledged human beings, believable even in the smallest details. This time the ever present side-plot of Bosch's ever present personal difficulties remains quite inobtrusive and surfaces only in a few scenes. This gives the book speed and a strong narrative quality. The breathless atmosphere in this situation, which is on the edge of exploding at any moment, would be broken by lengthy psychologically reflective moments, which are the trademark of his other novels. Here they would disturb the necessarily hectic progress of the story. <br />In form and content this novel is simply excellent!	2001-01-28

I do not know whether the case of this boy is realistic, but the story is excellent. All the other characters are very well developed and believable. The plot is breathtaking and has several unexpected twists. The ending reminds of a classical Agatha Christie show-down, with the difference that the characters in this book are genuine and psychologically sound in their presentation. The author does use his professional terminology but as a non-expert I did not get lost. The author explains everything, but not in a dry, professional way, the explanations are an integral part of the story and even contribute to the suspense. An extra class page turner.	2001-01-19

He is also a master of genuine horror - horror that is not necessarily caused by supernatural monsters or aliens or bogeymen. It is the horror that is immanent in human nature - more or less trammeled by the civilization and the rules of society. When they come into the open it is either due to mental or social sickness. In this book you can study persons that when they have the feeling of being almighty may exercise their dehumanized urges on innocent people. Man is the only being that kills for pleasure and personal satisfaction. Farris shows this in a novel full of breathteaking suspense. The Trevellians may be exaggerated and slightly unreal as characters but they represent a tendency in humans to play God and to feel like God. Hubris is punished in the classical Greek tragedy. But is this mortal sin always punished in our modern times?	2001-01-10

As a former Stephen King fan I have found his more recent books weaker than the novels of his first period. But this one is possibly his best! Born myself in 1944 I grew up in Germany and our problems may have been slightly different from those of of our American contemporaries. But the context was the same. It starts with the music and ends with the card games - on the surface. And knowing the spirit of that time I feel that everything in this book is genuine. A troubled post war generation is shown: in their youth they were educated by stubborn elders and had to flee into books like &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and others to see themselves and their dark sides mirrored in them. Their dark sides, which also emerged in a war which was not theirs but which ruthlessly destroyed many of them morally, psychically and physically. Their dark sides, which came into the open in a desperate fight for a better world, in which they destroyed themselves and their humanity when they became dehumanized terrorists and criminals. But they could not avoid becoming members of the establishment after all and probably now make the same mistakes of their parent generation all over again. So the ending is not a typical King ending, but it is reflective and perhaps marked by a certain resignation. King describes his era as an insider, as member of our generation, and this makes him so good. In addition, he speaks the language of his generation perfectly because he has listened to them all his life. A compelling study of our Western culture, a literary must, an excellent book!	2001-01-10

I still think that books two and three should be one book really. But the editors do not get stars (they would not get any star for their lousy selling policy!) But what a recompense! This book is one of the most exciting reads of science fiction I have ever read. It is breathtaking, full of nerveracking suspense, and you do not lay it down once you have started reading. The characters are well chosen, their motivations and actions very credible. Even the aliens do no longer appear as technically superior but a little stupid nevertheless. The authors give them a soul and more &quot;humanity&quot;. In this way a kind of tragedy can develop. The two races will never be able to be on friendly terms with each other, for technical reasons and because of their conflicting struggles for survival. So the ending is not the common and triumphant &quot;We have won!&quot;, but &quot;What will be?&quot; with a reflective sadness. A perfect book!<br />One piece of advice: If you want to read this book, make sure you read it after the two first ones. You will lose a lot if you do not read them in their numeric order.	2000-12-17

If Perry is indeed a writer of children's books he should work a little on his style and choice of words. I do not speak of the dialogs, but I think the colloquialisms and wrong grammar of the descriptive parts are no good, not even in a low quality paperback written to entertain and nothing else. Surprising events and twists in the story make the novel a good read, though. Some of the events do not have a motivation (why would the battleships destroy the earth?) and it is not really explained psychologically why Jay actually joins the MiB.  But, nevertheless,  a good book for a not too long journey on a plane.	2000-12-14

Never has there been written a more precious piece of tragic literature that seems so far away from the classic form of tragedy in its noble form, but surpasses its noble cousins by its down-to-earth credibility and realistic plot and setting. This is a tragedy that lives here and now, its language is fitting and almost poetic in its vulgarity and its humane simplicity. Whoever finds this language inadequate closes his eyes before the truth of reality. And he has difficulty in recognizing a simple human being and his basically tragic situation. George is a real tragic hero, who dwarfs Antigone and Oedipus because he is a simple human being and a real man. I will read this novel again and again.	2000-12-04

But the author has all the story-telling skills that it takes to tell a good old story, exciting and simple at the same time, with lots of fantasy and a charming protagonist. It is a fairy tale, so we do not have to worry about the credibilty of characters, action or plot. We read the story for the fun of it.

Greg Donegan presents us with a round story that is fully completed and does not necessarily need a sequel. But both books are very good. This one is a trifle better even than the &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot;. What I think very good is that the author does not make the same mistake as many modern SF authors: he does not indulge in painfully long descriptions of technical devices that do not exist, but writes a story for the story's sake. And it is a story full of suspense with characters that are credible and alive. In this book the fantasy elements are missing that give such a decisive character to the second book. But here the characters and a well constructed plot take over and make this novel a unique experience. I am waiting for number three now and I am certain that it will be as good as the first two.	2000-11-26

The novel is so unlike Chrichton that, in the process of reading it, I have often asked myself if he actually wrote it himself. Yes, I also had the impression that this is not a novel, but a script for a bad movie. The characters are completely unrealistic, they are supermen and -women, their actions are totally incredible. Imagine a 20th century scientist jousting against a medieval knight - and winning! And he is better with the sword than all his medieval adversaries that know how to fight with this weapon. Which brings us to the next flaw: violence. I have  nothing against it. It is - unfortunately - part of our lives. But here it is often used to attract certain readers that otherwise would not read books. It is true, the Middle Ages were violent times. But can we be sure that people then just rode through the forest and beheaded people just for the fun of it? And is it conceivable that all knights of that time were paranoid, inhuman and stupid sadists? All of them psychopaths? This is the impression you get when you read this book. Maybe Crichton should have read those books mentioned in the bibliography more closely. I have enjoyed most of Crichton's books. But this one is bad!	2000-11-16

The idea is very good, and I liked the carnival setting (which he will use again in Twilight Eyes, a far better book). But the characters and their actions are sometimes not really credible. Liz is a fictional character that would not survive long in reality. And Amy's motivation to follow Liz is also not realistic. But the story is full of suspense and a good read in your armchair or on the beach.	2000-11-03

Of his older novels, this is certainly one of the best books he wrote then. It has some minor flaws, though. In the descriptive passages the author tends to be a bit too talkative and in love with his own imagination and images. Even descriptions of places and items of minor or no importance become too long and are counterproductive to the suspense that should be predominant in a novel like this. Not that I speak against a moment of relaxation in the middle of thrilling action, but here, I find, the author exaggerated a bit. In addition, some of the characters' actions are not really motivated. Rya's reaction on the killing of Kelso is not based on the context of her character as described so far, and it does not have any impact on her future actions and the plot, either. But this is a great novel, a page turner that you cannot lay down. The story is very unusual, but this makes it all the better. And the carnival setting is one of the author's best ideas. You can see the later Koontz emerge in this novel. A very good book!	2000-10-30

The Viking era and our modern time are the backgrounds to a fight that has two sides: mankind and an anonymous enemy. It has been an eternal fight - thus the two settings. The switching between the two time levels guarantees pace and thrilling suspense. All those who favor hardcore SF will like the modern time situation with all its technical devices.

I have read nearly every novel he wrote, and some were real masterpieces. But this one is not: the characters are not really credible, their behavior is unmotivated and the love affair described altogether unrealistic in its motivation and execution. The horror displayed is that of cheap movies and lacks the refined ideas of Koontz other stories. The plot sometimes makes the impression as if the author was asked to fill in some more words. The ending is not an organic one that reflects the main plot, but one that suggests that the author had run out of fantasy when he wrote it. The idea could have been good, but the performance is really bad. I grant two stars, because I know that Dean is much better. everybody is allowed to fail once in a while.	2000-10-13

Not only does this novel have a most excellently developped plot, but its ironic style and humorous approach makes it a satire of its own genre at  the same time.

It would have been better if Tad Williams had written three books instead of one. The beginning is very confusing and the only thing you understand is that there might come some criticism of possible developemnts of the  internet. Perhaps this was the intention. But there is no depth, there is  no sincere discussion of the dangers of the net. Then there are too many  people and too many motivations and there is no ending. Even when there is  a sequel, there should be a kind of solution, or at least a first  relaxation after such a quest. But there is not. Then there are too many  genres mixed in this novel. There is a bit of Slaughterhouse 5, there is a  bit of science fiction (the novel is definitely not sf!), there is a bit of  a mainstream novel (with some thin social criticism), and yes, there is  Frodo looking round the corner, and among other ingredients there is a  pinch of Conan, too. Oh, and there is also the noble savage with the old  mirror that is supposed to reflect our wicked civilization.

On the one hand its plot creates tension - although you can predict the ending as a happy one from the beginning. This is due to the fact that the author only uses the subject of cloning as a means to  tell a story. And there she is just interested in the action, which is  quite interesting. And she is quite resourceful in this respect. Cloning  itself is never discussed seriously. The moral implications and the  negative, even disastrous consequences of human cloning is never even  considered. When the Characters talk or think about the problem they do it  in a trivial way - it is never really deep. Another flaw is that the  characters are inconsistent in their actions and presentation. Eric is very  smart when it comes to get into the institute, but once he is there he  turns into a completely naive person.

I think it  is very good that you do not have a clue as to how the story will end. The  tension is kept up. Hurry up Dean and Kristine!	2000-06-09
US	52417417	R30UBEUF67FQCN	0671024728	979997746	The Second Angel	Books	1	2	3	N	N	Boring!	I have enjoyed all books by Philip Kerr so far. But certainly not this one. Basically the idea may be good. But when you read the novel, you find that the characters are mere cartoon characters - they are not credible and  shaped in the bizarre way that we know from computer games. The action,  too, resembles the way through different levels in a computer dungeon  rather than a virtual sf reality. And then, the action is so often  interrupted by lengthy and boring scientific explanations, which, in  addition, get more boring by scores of long and uninteresting footnotes. If  you expect social criticism, you will not find it. Good science fiction  always mirrors our problems in this world. This book does not. Let's hope  for a better novel next time, Philip.	2000-06-02

K., it has an open ending. But we are promised the sequels, and one has already been published. Even in our fast living time we should be able to  show some patience. If the two sequels are only half as good as this book,  we can expect two very good novels to follow. <br />This book is really  thrilling. I have read it in one go. There have been other sf novels that  used the attractive combination of archaeology and science fiction. But  this is by far the best! Not only is the story well researched (the authors  know about what they write), but the two writers have also an excellent  feeling for action, suspense and human character. My copy of  &quot;Oblivion&quot; is on its way. I am looking forward to it (and I will  patiently wait for &quot;Final Assaut&quot;). The trilogy might get  &quot;cult status&quot;.	2000-05-14

This novel is for people who like cartoons, the people in it act like it, they are genuine cartoon characters. While there is nothing wrong with that at all and this kind of writing sometimes guarantees relaxing  entertainment, the action in this book is very often delayed by lenghty  background information that does not serve any purpose, and by endless  dialogues. Either we want a cartoon-like book with fast cartoon-like action  or a normal sf- or fantasy novel. You cannot have both.	2000-05-12

I have never read anything like this. Whereas plot and setting remind you of the traditional English mystery, the animals are a brilliant new idea.

But seems the best to me because Sandford has changed the pattern of these novels slightly here. Not only is Davenport not in one of his periods of depression. But this time his genius is not  the only factor that solves the case. Like in real life accident plays a  great role. When he finds out about Tennex he sees it from a completely  different angle than Clara Rinker when she found the name. And there are  still more examples. In this book Davenport becomes a little more human  than in the others. I enjoyed every single page of it. Come on, John, let  us have more Davenport stories!	2000-05-01

It is different from medical thrillers as it describes life itself. It creates its suspense and its attraction from the fact that the real world, real events are interwoven with fictional  characters who themselves are based on real characters.

But this one is entirely different. The author uses science to explain the phenomenon. This makes the strength and the weakness of the book.  We see vampires that are of this world and the author creates  horror - and a good one as well - without having to use the supernatural.  But his scientific explanations are too lengthy and kill suspense at times.  The ending is also a trifle too forced.  But all people who love horror  must read this novel.	2000-04-30

I must say his characters are much more believable than Cook's. Above all the woman protagonist, because this is  where Cook almost infallibly fails.

His plots are very well constructed, and he always manages to give the story a new twist, even after you think  &quot;that was it&quot;. And his characters are developped very  realistically and each of them a psychological study in itself. They are  all characters that could live next door.

Cook wrote really weak novels and this novel is anything but weak. With the millenium bug approaching the scenario in this  novel seems to be very realistic, and I think it is only a matter of time  until something like that happens. We have enough crooks sitting in front  of computers and there are enough &quot;intelligent&quot; software programs  being processed at the moment, we can be sure some time there will be a  disaster. The novel has its small flaws though. It is only readable for  people who know computers. Maybe it would be much more interesting to  people who do not know computers. And the side plot Mark - Alex is simply  unnecessary. The motivation is wrong and it does not in any way promote the  meaning or even the speed of the novel. Sometimes less can be more! But  certainly, it is a good and suspensful read, if not a page turner.  Definitely not a Robin Cook!	1999-09-04

The plot is well constructed at first, and there is a lot of action and suspense. But I was also disappointed. Unlike in the other novels the main characters - above all Joanna Blalock -  are not really consistent or believable in their presentation, with the  exception of Sinclair.

And he tells them well; he has a rich and imaginative language full of subtle metaphors and surprising lingusistic turns. But what kind of stories are  these? What is this book about? Is it about the importance of accident in  our lives? Is it about existential problems? I could not find any logically  relevant discussion about these problems in this book. Is it against  society? Certainly not because nothing in this book is as strong as its  emphasis on the fact that you cannot survive without money, and the more  money you have the better. Without money your existence is in danger. What  is striking in this book, too, is the complete absence of moral values.  People do what they want, take from others what they need. There is no  visible encouragement for people to show solidarity with their fellow human  beings. The love story that accompanies the main action is - as a  consequence - illogical and neither supports the main stories nor does it  form a counterpoint to them. A weird book!	1999-06-25

It is not highly scientific because at the moment we can only speculate what kind of impact  cloning of humans may have on us - once it is allowed. If it is not  allowed, it will be done - because what someone thinks will be carried out.  It has been like that throughout our scientific history. (Otto Hahn dropped  the idea of the atomic bomb - and someone else built it.)  We will have to  face human clones in the very near future. And we want to know how we will  face this new situation. And this is what this book is about. It gives you  a variety of impulses and, of course, it has to be highly speculative. We  simply cannot analyze a situation that we do not have in reality. The  stories at the end of the book are not very good, but they are a good try  to interest readers that have difficulties with facts only. Science fiction  literature would have provided far better stories. I am glad this book was  written, and I'm glad I'm not a clone.	1998-12-18

But the book never becomes a real  thriller, because the pace is too slow, there are not enough surprising  turns in the action and the &quot;climax&quot; at the end is not really  breath-taking. We know how the book will end for every character at a very  early stage of reading. The theme of a ruthless business man in a  pharmaceutical company is not very new either(Robin Cook and others!).

What a psychogram of a lonely woman who turns mad because of her inability to cope with the society of other people! Or is it the dog? The author tells the story with great subtlety and a terrific feeling for atmosphere. The woman's development is at the same time incredible and understandable. The dog is a mystic beast and you never know if he is a projection of the protagonist's sick mind or a supernatural animal that wants her soul and body. And so it is not clear: is this a genuine horror story or a mainstream novel with horror elements created by the description of a woman turning mad? Is she mad already when she first sees Robin or is he the cause of her madness? One thing is certain. This madness is not over. It will start all over again. Great novel, Mary!	1998-11-25

A best selling author like Cook should be expected to control his writing better. But this novel is too obvious in its plot. After reading about  fifty pages you can exactly imagine what will be next. And you can be  pretty sure what kind of ending the story might have.  Cook writes about a  really burning problem of our time. But the plot is too improbable and  implausible to cope with the seriousness of this problem. His afterword is  better than the whole book.

When I read the book first I was impressed with the presentation of the American way of life in a southern town. It is genuine. I - myself - am a teacher of English in Germany and - I hope - an objective observerof the American life in small towns, which I have enjoyed so often. I decided to read this book with my 13th grade and we have just finished it. My students are enthusiastic about it. Being closer to the age of Cory than I am, they found nuances I did not realize myself and I, being about as old as Cory would be now, could give them information about that time. We were nonsurplussed by the rich and creative imagery Robert McCammon uses in this novel. We were also surprised at the important and imaginative steps of initiation Cory can enjoy and has to endure. The novel has become a \\"cult book\\" in my 13th grade. This is all the more surprising as English is a foreign language to them. Thank you Robert MacCammon. When do we hear from you again?	1997-11-14
