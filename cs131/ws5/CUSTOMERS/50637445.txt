They don't take any knowledge or organizational ability for granted, and they have great senses of humor. Their card-file system will probably work for most people who are SHE's (Sidetracked Home Executives) because of their creativity, or just general distractedness.<br />If, however, you are a SHE because you're a frozen perfectionist, someone who never cleans because you don't have time to do it RIGHT, this is not the book for you. The card-file is wonderful - except that I'm entirely capable of spending the next 6 months making sure I've got the file system perfect without ever actually doing any of the stuff on it. There's also nothing to prevent you from overloading yourself with nit-picking chores and burning out. If these sound like things you would be prone to, then I would recommend &quot;Sink Reflections&quot; by Marla Cilley instead. She uses much of the same material as Pam and Peggy (she credits them as her inspiration), but her program is specifically designed for those of us who try so hard for perfection we get nowhere.<br />If perfectionism isn't your problem, then by all means go with Pam and Peggy. They're great fun to read, and however bad your house is, they will understand.	2002-12-22

It's clear, concise, and covers a multitude of useful things, starting with a reasonable synopsis of the fundamentals of clicker training, then taking you through a 6 week dog training course, and then addressing a number of individual concerns seperately (Housebreaking, Aggression, Socialization, etc.). If you want a fuller explanation of operant conditioning theory, or broader application, I would suggest Karen Pryor's \\"Don't Shoot the Dog\\", but Pat Miller includes a perfectly decent abbreviated explanation.<br />My only gripe is in the Housebreaking section, where she gives a decent rundown on the theoretics of how to housebreak, but then gives a \\"sample\\" day from a theoretical family. The family in question has four adult equivalents (Mother, father, 2 teenagers), and all are actively involved in the housebreaking. This makes it pretty irrelevant (and downright depressing) for someone like me who is trying to housebreak a puppy with Mommy, no help from Daddy, and two preschoolers, who are certainly no help in training the puppy - after all we're still working on housebreaking THEM.<br />On the other hand, this is a minor gripe, especially as I've never found a dog training book that did provide realistic housebreaking around toddlers, and the book is otherwise excellent.	2002-09-05

She's written three books, and all three of them could have been justly called Mirabile (Wonderful in Latin). The other two, Hellspark and Uhura's Song are also favorites, but Mirabile is a delight, and just pure fun. Kangaroo rexes! Odders! Tulip bats! Oh the wonderful and surprising things that can happen to the wildlife when someone's been mucking around in their genepool. Annie Jason Masmajean is our heroine, I guess you would call her profession field genetics. It's her job to provide the colonists of Mirabile with the critters and plants they need to survive, and ensure that the strange beasties that keep cropping up (The scientists back on earth got cute with genetic redundancy), don't harm the colonists or the vital species that they need. It's a very light-hearted read, but not lacking one iota of depth. Between this book and her other two Janet Kagan has me itching for more. Anything she produces, I will buy, and there are very few authors I can say that about.	2002-08-26

By the end of this set of three novels in one, Butterfly has found out a lot more about herself, the Hellflowers in general, her Hellflower in particular, and the history of the sentient machines than any sane person would want to know. Not an endless classic, but a good and engaging read.	2002-08-21

The commands given are pretty standard, and the instructions are clear and logical. My only real gripe is that the title implies positive training, which this is not. This book teaches very traditional training, with leash corrections and other such, not the positive training method espoused by Karen Pryor (Don't Shoot the Dog). The author does place a welcome emphasis on not punishing your dog for what he doesn't yet understand, and on praising and rewarding good behavior, but positive training is a method, not an attitude. Adding more praise to traditional training gives you a kinder gentler traditional training, not positive training.<br />That said, if you're more comfortable with traditional methods than with click and treat, this is a good book to work from.	2002-07-18

I read the book hoping to have an idea of what to watch as my boys get older. What happened and what I wasn't expecting was that my school career would be explained in a sudden blast of enlightenment. Dr. Levine breaks down the child mind into functional bits, and explains how different systems can go wrong, and how that can effect virtually everything that child does. For a child with a deficit that falls into school-required activities (like a problem hearing phonemes) what is a relatively small breakdown of function (and we all have some) can translate into a devastating blow to their ability to handle school work and life. He covers a multitude of different systems and possibilities for their problems (including at least 9 different ways in which attention can fail), in the process covering several things that the schools don't recognize and sometimes breaking one accepted category (ADD) into many different possible deficits, each of which is handled differently. <BR>   What hit me like a bombshell was the chapter on sequencing. I was a top notch student who spent my entire career terrified that someone was going to hit me with something that I couldn't do, because every once in a while I'd hit something (timelines in history class, lists of states and their capitols and exports) that I just couldn't seem to do. Since I was an honor student, nobody ever thought (or would have cared) that I might have a problem. It certainly never occurred to me. The only possibilities I knew were that I was stupid or lazy, and I obviously wasn't stupid. <BR>  I won't go on with my whole student career, but suffice to say that if I could send my younger self back a copy of this book (well highlighted) I think my life would be very different. It would be well worth the time it takes to read this book to see if you can find such a chance to change a lifenow.	2002-07-18

All of Janet Kagan's books are wonderful, and my only gripe with her as an author is that she's only written three so far (Please Ma'am can I have some more?) Hellspark is a fascinating first contact book, with a crystal clear look at how our culture informs our assumptions, and the huge messes those assumptions can cause. Tocohl Susumo (our Hellspark protagonist) is wonderful as the only good cultural interpreter in a mass of surveyors from vastly different worlds, Maggy, her computer is a delightful mix of rapid thinking and small-child personality, and her aliens (the Sprookje) are truly alien without being unbelievable or trite. If you've already read this one, go on and try Mirabile and Uhura's Song, which are also wonderful reads.	2002-06-28

Her characters are, as always, deftly drawn, and her world building is exquisite. My only complaint, and the reason for four stars instead of five, is a matter of plot timing. She spends a long time drawing us into the convoluted problems of Isvaltan politics, and how even the people with the best intentions and motives end up doing awful things just to survive, thereby rendering it almost impossible to tell who is a friend and who is an enemy. I was waiting with bated breath to see how Bridget (our heroine) was even going to survive, never mind suceed, in the morass she'd been thrown into. Then, once Bridget actually arrives at the Isvaltan court, her amazing powers and quick thinking manage to resolve almost every difficulty in record time. She is never once trapped into the kind of Catch-22 that the others characters have spent years living with. It's deftly managed, and reasonably believable, but it feels like a little bit of a cop-out. I wanted Bridget to have some serious doubts and difficulties figuring out whose side she should be on, and that never happened.  Other than that, it's an excellent read, with a lot of interesting people and places, and very rich fantasy. I look forward to the next book.	2002-05-14

Mr. Doherty raises a lot of interesting questions that a thinking believer needs to deal with, or at least ought to deal with. However the more of his writing I read, the more a couple of things sang through loud and clear. First - here is a man in desperate need of at least a little bit of humility. After all, many intelligent learned people over many centuries have believed in Jesus with all their heart, and all their soul, and all their mind - is it just possible that they weren't all fools, gullible, or blind? Second, Mr. Doherty has faith as strong and as blind as any religious fanatic on the face of the earth. The name of his God is Reason. Reason shall solve everything, explain everything, and if we would all just follow Reason in faith, everything would all work out for the best. Sorry Mr. Doherty - I tried Reason, and decided I would rather worship Good. Reason will lead you anywhere with no eye for discernment - logic can prove anything given the appropriate starting (and thus unproven) premises.	2002-05-13

Lewis, the view from the outside	If you've ever wondered what C.S. &quot;Jack&quot; Lewis looked from the outside, rather than from inside his own head, this is the book for you. Mr. Downing writes in a very readable way, and has obviously done a tremendous amount of research. He writes mostly about the &quot;lost&quot; years in between Jack's early childhood, and the beginning of his conversion as an adult. Mr. Downing traces Jack's thought and theology through his own writings (letters and unfinished or unpublished works) and provides a coherent and very interesting overview of his development from a very cynical young man (though of substantially divided mind) through to the final step of his conversion, covering many things that Lewis himself either glossed over, or never discussed in his autobiographical work. It also covers how some of the conflicts that Jack ran into in his early life were later written about in characters in his novels - he actually made me want to go back and reread the &quot;Perelandra&quot; series, which I haven't been very impressed with up until now. If you've read much C.S. Lewis, and want to know more about him, I would recommend the book highly.	2002-05-12

I will simply add one commentary for those not familiar with Maureen McHugh's work. While Ms. McHugh is an excellent writer with distinctive and elegant prose, and while exciting things do happen to characters in her books, her books are virtually entirely character centered rather than plot centered. Frequently the &quot;action&quot; part of the plot will be ignored in favor of following what is more personally important to the character being followed. This is particularly evident in her endings, which can be confusing to those of us used to plot-driven novels. Her novels end (and Nekropolis is no exception) at the point where the character makes a fundamental change, rather than at any given point of plot. In China Mountain Zhang, the book ends just when the most interesting plot parts would be starting. Here, the book goes on for a while after a plot driven book would have stopped, and then ends when the main character gets a hair cut - an insignificant point of plot, but a very significant step of assimilation for our protagonist. This isn't a fault in the books particularly, just something to be aware of if you haven't read her stuff before.	2002-05-10

The Pilates exercises are very do-able in fairly short spaces of time, and show impressively quick results. Despite an apparent shortage of motion photos, with careful reading of the instructions, I've never had a real problem figuring out how a given exercise was supposed to work. My only real difficulty with the book was a lack of suggested priorities. There is a beginners workout of seven exercises, which is a great start, but very little by way of help on how to shift from the seven beginner exercises to the 30 exercise basic program in gradual steps. I'm still trying to work my way from one to the other, and the process is being significantly slowed down by the need to sit down and study every time I want to figure out what exercise I need to add next. Other than that annoyance, a good and interesting book.	2002-04-27

It provides instruction on a number of different kinds of prayer that can be done using scripture that is clear, succinct and helpful, but it also provides a lot more than that. The introduction has a good discussion on the hows and whys of scriptural prayer, and the back of the book has extensive lists of scripture readings broken into topical sections so that those who are fairly new to studying the bible, can nonetheless find appropriate passages for in depth prayer on a variety of topics. Highly recommended for anyone interested in increasing the depth of their prayer life.	2002-03-31

In fairness to the plotting, at each step of the way investigating looks like the reasonable thing to do. This makes it much easier to take than some mysteries where the investigator is finding out what happened for sheer nosiness. Desiree Shapiro is an interesting person, funny, self-deprecating, very ethical at the oddest times, and I will probably read more of this series. I just wish that I hadn't gotten to the end of the book, and decided that everyone would have been better off if Desiree had been in Timbuktu for the week.	2001-09-28

Unfortunately for the world at large, most people who are Christians in the sense that they attend a Christian church, are not disciples of Christ in any significant sense of the word. Usually not from malice or any great evil, but stemming from their own comfort in their world as it stands. It's very easy to get used to a given way of life, and not to challenge yourself regularly about your behavior.<BR>Unfortunately the time the book was written does show through heavily in a lot of places, which mars it's message somewhat. Many of the people in the book are drawn into the fight against the &quot;saloon&quot;, which was the big fight of the era, ending of course with Prohibition. While I can see why Christians of that era felt impelled to fight saloon interests, I think they were making a basic mistake in discipleship that still occurs regularly today. Christ didn't help &quot;the poor&quot; or fight &quot;the establishment&quot;. He helped people who needed help, and chastized people who needed chastizing - right in front of him. People were always particular to him, not part of mass movements. It's easy to think of how many more people you could help with a movement than with your own hands, but in the end helping people yourself, and more than that helping individuals is what the Christian message is all about. &quot;Love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot;<BR>Sermon over. It's a good book, just remember that no one, not even Mr. Sheldon can answer the question of &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; for your life. Only you can do that.	2001-08-31

However, it is good enough that I'm on the hunt for more of them. The tale itself, a physical and legal hunt for which of two subspecies of humans have first claim on the planet Glaice, is gripping in and of itself. Underlying the tale though, and I would suspect the rest of the series, is the difficult question: How do you have equality, mutual respect, and fairness under the law when there are very real biological differences between the groups being adjucated? Humanity has split into several subspecies (genetically created), and each has it's own culture and needs, sometimes mutually exclusive. Mostly this is dealt with by simply having the various groups live on different planets, but sometimes this doesn't work, and what do you do then? Simple good will won't work, and the races keep having this nasty tendancy to forget that the others are sapient too. Enter the Arbiter, whose job it is to deal with these issues before they could explode. Only the Arbiter has a little problem, his weapons are gone, and he can't afford to let the warring parties know. A very enjoyable read.	2001-08-19

The study dates from 1981, and much has changed since then, so in some ways it's a little dated. Also being a formal study, it's rather dry and heavy on the math.

My only real complaint with this series is that I found it too early, and have to wait, and wait, and wait for each new book to come out. I have consistently found Ms. Elliott's books to be excellent reading. Her characters are varied and very believable. I love Liath, who even when she whines, or hasn't a clue, manages to get the job done (gives me hope for myself).<br />A note on the female dominated society. While females are definately prominant here, the men seem to be holding their own pretty well. I will admit that in general men are stronger soldiers (I take exception to faster, most of the fastest movers I know are female - it usually varies roughly indirectly with size), and therefore most notable soldiers would be likely to be male. However, it there have been many societies, even some strongly male-dominated, where descent has been counted through the female line. The reason is simple - you can never be certain who a child's father is, but you can be very certain of who his or her mother is. In patriarchal society then, a man's heirs would be his sister's sons, rather than his wife's. Nothing strange therefore about a matriarchal lineage in a more egalitarian society.	2001-07-30

Part of whether you like this book will depend on what you're looking for in your reading. If you like dark, depressing, realistic fantasies with all of the dark side of human nature exposed, the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever are for you. Mr. Donaldson writes with gripping power, and his world will draw you in irresistably. Unfortunately for some of us this is a problem. I don't read to find out about the dark underbelly of human nature, I generally see enough of that on the evening news. I read to find pattern and meaning in things that may otherwise seem horrible - which never really seems to happen in Donaldson's books - at least not in this series. His writing is undeniably powerful, but very, very dark. By the last book &quot;White Gold Wielder&quot; I couldn't not read the book, but I was depressed for darn near two weeks after reading it.<br />In short, Donaldson is a good writer, but I really can't recommend this series. Try &quot;Mirror of Her Dreams&quot; instead. The same powerful writing, with a much more optomistic view of human nature.	2001-07-28

It's critique is fairly well reasoned, and accurate in many respects. I think the author gives too little credit to many individuals who well realize the downsides of feel-good psychology, but in general many of his points are well taken. The criticism in the main is also a defense of Christianity as the more valid and useful (and true), of the two possibilities, which he sees (and makes a good arguement for seeing) as inherently incompatible. I don't agree with everything he says - largely because my own beliefs and views are substantially different from his on several points, but many of his concerns are well taken. I.e. self-esteem without grounds is merely narcissism and self-worship. Worth the time I spent reading it.	2001-07-28

Most of what other people have said about it is true. My major objection is that it led me into a series that lasted far too long before I gave up on it - and I got nowhere near through the series. If you can read one book of a series and leave it at that, then go ahead and read Spellsinger, it's an entertaining funny read with great characters. On the other hand if you're like me, and tend to want to read all of a series, even if it goes downhill, don't get started with this one.	2001-07-23

It's the tale of a young and highly gifted pianist, who is sent off to a boarding school where her talent is anything but appreciated. In fact the school administrators firmly believe they are doing her a favor by forcing her to broaden her interests, and by limiting her practice time and forbidding her access to the piano at other times. There's a good deal of interplay between our protagonist and her family (it's family difficulties that cause boarding school in the first place), and her relationship with her piano teacher. It's a bittersweet look at a time of life that's difficult for many, made more so by circumstance and talent that must have it's way.	2001-07-19

This book has been wonderful for providing me with the information, grammer, syntax and vocabulary I needed in a clear enough format that the need to find someone to ask questions of was very minimal. Usages are well explained, the exercises are well gauged for difficulty, and in general the book is very helpful and usable and I would recommend it highly. My only gripe, and the reason for the loss of one star is that there is no answer key, nor any separate teacher's manual where I could check my work on the exercises. This is only intermittently a problem, but occassionally causes difficulties.	2001-07-16

It's spectacular to look at, and my son thinks so too. He loves pointing out each of the animals over and over again, commenting on colors and the sun. <br />The retold African folktale is a great read, a good sequence of events, and a good illustration of logical consequence. My only argument (and this is with interpretation rather than the book itself) is that: a)nobody asks the mosquito what happened and b) what the mosquito tells the igauna in the beginning isn't a lie. It's silly and irrelevant, yes, but she's not lying. The farmer was undoubtably digging up yams bigger than the mosquito.

Because my husband made off with it, and read it in virtually one sitting. This was fortunate, as I wouldn't have been willing to wait very long to get my hands on it. It's a non-stop romp, with plenty of adventure, lots of chuckles, and a lot of hair-raising moments. Val Con and Miri are in trouble, and so is the rest of Clan Korval. As usual they deal with trouble in adept, surprising, and often amusing ways, confounding both friends and enemies along the way. More is seen of Anthora and Nova than in previous books, and some more is learned of the Yxtrang - who have been largely a cipher up until now. If you haven't run into this series before you need to start with Partners in Necessity, which is an omnibus of the first three Liaden novels.

The side issues in the books start getting heavier as the series goes on (Women's lib here, Environmentalism, Institutionalized animal abuse in other books), but rarely get so heavy as to overshadow the book - probably because they're introduced as situations and actions rather than as preaching. Rowdy and Kimi are delightful, and if you like dogs at all, this series is well worth looking at.	2001-06-12

The writer has a lot of imagination, interesting characters, and a good plot. Unfortunately she simply doesn't write very well. Problems with character viewpoint, problems with explication, slow writing - nothing truly awful, but if bad writing bothers you, you'll find it hard to get past it to the story. I certainly did.	2001-06-09

For anyone looking for encouragement for breastfeeding, and/or reasons to give friends and family about why you want to breastfeed, it's a great book.<br />However, if you've already decided to breastfeed, and are looking for something to get you through the tough parts, I can't recommend it. As far a reader could tell from this book, there are no tough parts. My fear is that someone having a difficult time with breastfeeding could decide that something must be really wrong, and quit in discouragement believing that other women don't have such difficulties. Having breastfed my first child to 20 months, and at one year and counting with my second, I can tell you that there are very tough moments in breastfeeding. LLL would be doing women more of a service if they didn't softsoap it, or use the soft-focus filter on all the possible problems.	2001-06-07

The rewrite comes back and cleans up a lot of those faults. Unfortunately it adds several new ones, leaving us with a book essentially about the same quality as the old one.<br />Ms. Tyers gives us more depth on Netaian culture and religion, which was welcome. She cleans up Phoena's character a bit, which is the original wavered between spoiled brat and true evil plotter. She moves the start of the romance between Firebird and Brennan closer to the end of the book, which is more feasible. She removes several improbably trusting moments from the book - I mean really, the Federates allowing the slaughter of most of their negotiating team? All of these are good things.<br />On the down side, without the attraction to Brennan so visible, Firebird becomes rather insipid in the middle section of the book, the religious questing might have taken the place of the romance in providing drive, but somehow doesn't. Instead she's barely gotten started questioning when she has a huge epiphanal moment, and now she believes, even if she doesn't quite know what. Ummm - if God had given me a great epiphanal moment right at the start, I wouldn't have had any problem believing either. Things are usually more subtle than that. The Ehretan religion is a bit of a problem too. For a pre-Messianic religion they seem to know an awful lot about what this Messiah is going to be like, and it bears a suspicious resemblance to our Christ. After all, Jesus wasn't at all what the Jews of the day had in mind. <br />There are some other minor quibbles. Ellet Kinsman is more ethical in her behavior in this version, but somehow less likeable. The old Ellet would do the virtually unforgiveable, but she was doing it out of great emotions and desires which we understood, and could understand even if we disagreed. The new Ellet does less horrible things, but we're given less reason for why she does them, so she seems very dry and remote.<br />All in all, I call it a wash, it was a pretty good book before, it's a pretty good book now, just different in emphasis.	2001-06-05

This book is a much easier to take read for me and I think for most women (though it would be as irritating for most men as the original was for most women). It is somewhat more subtly marred by the occassional misuse of a gender term - I.e. &quot;womanly&quot; does not substitute straight for &quot;manly&quot; in most usage without making the resultant sentence rather odd.<br />Other than this quibble, it is an excellent book and one I would recommend to anyone as nourishing food to feed your mental life.	2001-06-03

This one takes the principles that Mr. Leonard has learned from his practice of aikido, and translates it into practical principles for following the path of Mastery in any skill. It's simply and skillfully written, and easily understandable - the principles of mastery are easy, it's the staying on the path that's hard. As a born hacker, someone who gets to the level of &quot;good enough&quot; in every area, and then just hangs around there forever, this book gave me the tools I needed to start forgeing ahead again in many things.<br />The most profound things don't have to be complicated, in fact they're usually simple.

Anybody who has lost their love of singing because of the need to &quot;get it right&quot;, anybody with stage fright (or even just a severely stiff stage presence), anyone who doesn't believe they can really perform should read this book.

The style is clear and readable, with using plenty of biblical material without getting bogged down in it. The text references the passages, but does not reprint them, leaving it up to the reader to decide how much of the actual passages they need to study. It's divided into several sections, such as History, and Doctrine, which helps keep things much more readable by only tracking one kind of information through the text at a time. <br />One note: this is an Episcopalian theology text, which means among other things that it does not take the bible as the inerrant Word of God. The author has a clear and abiding reverence for God, but believes that the tellers of the tales, and writers of the prophecies of the bible are as prone to errors of interpretation or distortion or faulty memory as any other set of human beings. So if this is likely to offend you, don't bother.	2001-04-29

However for me the more fascinating part of the book is the actual tale of how the Church came to be forced to face the fact of women priests, and why the women and the bishops who ordained them felt impelled to take their drastic action. The last part of the book I found less attention grabbing, partially because I don't empathize well with the group oppression mind-set, being far too strong an individualist. This is more my failing than the author's, but it constitutes a weakness in the book at least as far as I'm concerned. I suppose I wanted more of the facts and less of the personal ruminating, but since this is intended as autobiographical I can't actually say that ruminating by the author is either out of place or off topic.<br />Overall, well worth the read.	2001-04-25

However, it didn't come off in my reading as homage to Tarzan, so much as a straight lifting of the plot. While it was somewhat refreshing to see Burroughs-type fiction done from the female perspective, unfortunately most of the Burroughs problems except for the male-dominance remain prevelant; most importantly the essential junvenility of a lot of the plot and perspective. If you basically like fiction written for teenaged boys, except for the strong sexism that such fiction tends to have, you'll probably enjoy this. If you've graduated to sterner fare, you probably won't get past the first half dozen chapters.<br />In side note though: There have been some fairly modern and well documented cases of feral children - not many to be sure, but enough to make it not completely impossible speculation to have such a child raised by wolves. The difficulty is that by the time such children were found and brought to civilization they were usually beyond the capability of learning true language, and were probably too young at the time they started living in the wild anyway, so there was no way to find out how they had survived.	2001-04-07

Unfortunately the information appears in the middle of a huge mish-mash of every kind of alternative therapies. Reflexology occurs right beside various vitamin therapies, lithium treatment of manic-depression, food allergies and sensitivities, and heavy metal poisoning.<br />The various causes, and therapies discussed have little or no evaluation of their effectiveness, or history discussed. A fair number of individual cases are discussed, but nothing that would allow a reader to distinguish the obviously helpful from the promising from the complete hookum.<br />Another problem is that while good nutrition is discussed, and various ways in which supplements (vitamin &amp; other) can help people achieve better health, there is no way given to try to sort out what kinds of supplements might do you some good. There is an exception for a couple of disorders (like alcoholism), where there is a more general discussion of what supplements a heavy drinker should take, particularly if s/he is trying to quit, but in general, no.<br />Last but not least, the discussion of toxic environments goes beyond unhelpful and into downright alarmist. While maintaining a healthy environment is admitably difficult in this day and age (if not impossible), it does no one any good to be looking at everything they eat, breathe, or touch as a potential toxin. So doing only raises stress levels - which as this book points out, is an environmental/lifestyle problem all its own.<br />In short - there's some interesting information in here, but it's not worth the effort, and the resultant paranoia from reading the book, to extract it.	2001-04-02

That's about it. It's loaded with statements about what you ought to do with your child - for instance you be firm about your child's eating habits, but take his/her preferences into account - with few or no examples about just how one should go about doing these things. There are some chapters that are better - the chapter on dealing with children's fears is not bad - and some that are worse. Infomation for younger children is scanty, and often didactic, or worse contradictory. One chapter says to respond quickly to your crying infant to give him/her a sense of some control, another says to delay responding to your crying infant so that (s)he can learn to self-calm. These may both be accurate statements, but if the author is going to assert both, than he needs to make some attempt to reconcile the two. I.e. Under what circumstances would one delay responding to a crying child? At a particular age? With a particular personality type?<br />Last, but certainly not least, Dr. Shapiro pays lip-service in the introduction to balanced parenting, saying that neither permissive nor authoritarian parenting is good for children's emotional health (Certainly true). However in the body of the book, all his diatribes are reserved for the permissive parents, and all his references to dictatorial parents are in the past, as if such things don't occur today. Certainly overly permissive parents exist, but the dictatorial parent is a long way from being a thing of the distant past.<br />You might browse it at your local library if you're really interested. Don't bother buying it.	2001-03-30

Ms. Krims color palattes gave me several choices of color schemes that would incorporate the rooms that were already there, and have saved me a substantial amount of time and money repainting all the rooms. For instance, the living room when we got it was painted a medium dark grey-green, with yellow, dark green, red, and pink(!) for accent colors. We thought it looked awful, but were loathe to repaint the entire huge room. It turns out that this room is the right shade of green for doing &quot;Emerald Isle&quot;, which we liked very much. With the culprit accent colors removed and replaced, suddenly our awful green living room isn't nearly so awful. Well worth the money we spent for it.	2001-03-28

She covers almost everything in here that could disrupt sleep, from hormone fluctuations, to snoring partners, to small children. While I will continue to suffer from periodic sleep deprivation for a while (comes with the job when you're a mother of small kids), with this book, I know I can keep the temporary sleep disruptions from becoming a habit and a way of life. My only gripe at all is that sometimes you have to wade through a lot of information intended for other people to find what's relevant to you, but most of the information is interelated, so that's not too tedious a job. Good job overall.	2001-03-21

I came out of the public school system with great grades, and a top-notch education by almost anyone's standards - and no idea what to do with myself unless someone was telling me what I ought to be doing. I floundered around for years wondering what the heck was wrong with me if I couldn't use this brain that I obviously had, to do something with my life.<br />Dr. Schank provided useful answers. School never taught me what I needed to succeed anywhere but school. The passion and intense curiousity that my 2 year old exhibits every day, is a distant memory for me. For him though, it's natural, and it can be nutured and developed, and the school system isn't likely to do it. That means it's up to his parents.<br />Certainly not all that Dr. Schank says is wrong with schools is wrong with every school. Some are better, some are worse. He is pointing out though that even the very &quot;best&quot; schools are going to have problems teaching some real life skills because of an inherent problem of structure and paradigm.<br />Equally certainly not every child is going to react exactly like Dr. Schank's kids to every situation. Kids are different. Each and every one of them is unique. It's up to their parents to pay enough attention to know what is likely to work or not work with their own kid. What he provides is a lot of valuable ideas about the kinds of things parents can do to foster original thinking, passion and persistence in their kids. I can't ask for much more than that.	2001-03-19

This book uses a very similar philosophy, but uses many &quot;real life&quot; examples involving kids of various ages, particularly younger kids. It has provided me with a whole book full of different ideas to try, many of them broadly applicable to many different situations, which is wonderful. There's no assumption that one perfect method will work for every child (which is never true). <br />If you want more reading on the kind of principles and thinking that go into this kind of firm flexible parenting you might try Kids are Worth It, but this is sufficient unto itself for giving parents practical ways to be good, sane parents with responsible, thinking kids.	2001-03-17

First, some of us can't use it. For instance, as a nursing mother I can't superhydrate until after I'm done nursing, nor can I cut my calories as drastically as advocated without jeapordizing my milk supply (I realize this is a temporary problem). My other major difficulty is that it is a 6 week program, and doesn't really provide much information or helpful advice on what to do when you're not following the program.

Let's face it, mammals don't change color or mimic sticks, or other such interesting things while hiding. Mostly they try to blend in to the background, and since the style of drawing in this series tends to de-emphasize background, the mammals don't hide too well comparatively speaking.

If you do have another one, this is certainly a good member of the series. Some of the fishes are very difficult to find (Even I took a few tries to find all of the pipefish).

All of the books are at least good, but this one is one of the better ones. The best of them all is probably &quot;How to Hide a Meadow Frog&quot;, which my son only no longer reads because it fell to pieces about 2 months ago from constant reading. Butterfly, Crocodile, and Octopus are all also very good. Unless you're buying the whole series, I'd take a pass on &quot;How to Hide a Polar Bear&quot; and &quot;How to Hide a Parakeet&quot;. The former tries, but the mammals simply don't hide as interestingly as the insects or the amphibians, while the latter depends too much on the mottled brown birds, when there are plenty of birds out there that hide very well with more interesting coloration.	2001-02-21

I read it after reading &quot;The Fifth Sacred Thing&quot;, which I liked, though with some reservations. I personally did not care for &quot;Walking to Mercury&quot;, however I can see that someone who grew up in the same generation as Maya probably would. As our major character she is very caught up in the times and the culture of the '60's, and anyone who was familiar with the '60's and sympathetic to that variety of idealism would probably find it very good reading. <br />Unfortunately for my enjoyment I come from another generation down the line (born in 1969). The baby-busters. Known briefly as Generation X, until the advertisers realized there weren't enough of us to bother with, and started using the term to refer to the baby-boomlet that occured right afterwards (hence proving the point the name was coined to highlight). For me, Maya Greenwood the crone in &quot;The Fifth Sacred Thing&quot; was an enjoyable character. Unfortunately the same person in her 20's and 30's just made me want to shake her because she was being so blasted stupid. The sheer pointlessness of Maya's entire &quot;spiritual journey&quot; up until 3/4's of the way through the book made me want to scream. I was simply struck by the self-aggrandizement, selfishness, and ultimate pointlessness of most of the behavior of most of the characters in the book. It's very hard to like even a well written book, when you don't like most of the people in it.<br />The book does redeem itself somewhat towards the end. You get inklings of how Maya begins to deepen into the far more interesting person she is by &quot;The Fifth Sacred Thing&quot;, and her relationships begin to metamorphose into something more worthwhile - just about the time the book ends. So not entirely awful, but mostly for those who lived the 1960's.	2001-02-20

Most such books vanish forever into the mists of time with their plots long forgotten. Tic-Tac however, I still remember images and details even after 20 years. It's a pretty typical young girl and her horse book, it's simply well plotted and filled with interesting characters.

Then I heard someone trashing it because it had &quot;no morality&quot;, which confused me greatly because I remembered a great deal of morality in the book. So I went back and reread it with the criticism in mind. My conclusions were that it is easy to miss the deep and subtle morality in the book. It is true that Thomas Moore does not side with hard and fast moral rules. In particular he advises care rather than cure for maladies no matter their nature. For instance: the first specific example he gives is bulemia. When a young lady presents to him with a problem with bulemia he explores with her her feelings about food, her parents, and her life in general, rather than directly assaulting the bulemia. In his view behaviors like this, no matter how destructive of oneself or others are the surfacing of some need of the soul, and the appropriate reaction is to inquire, observe, and then try to find some less distressing way to meet the need, rather than to simply try to stop the behavior.<br />In principle I agree with his thoughts. On the other hand, I can see why a lot of people might have problems with the implication that people engaged in behaviors that hurt themselves or others should observe and inquire rather than stop the behavior. In some instances - affairs, abuse, drugs, deep depression etc. I would decidedly tend to agree with those who think the behavior should be stopped first, and then examined and inquired into in retrospect rather than as an ongoing process. Some things are simply too damaging to continue doing.<br />However, Moore's principle arguement is that even the worst behaviors need to be examined in this way rather than simply excised from the soul, and there I tend to agree with him. To simply tell someone to stop an ongoing behavior because it is wrong, without having them make any attempt to find out what need is being met, or why they do such things is doomed to failure. The need that was showing in the behavior will simply resurface, and the behavior will resume, or some other method will be found which may be equally or even more distressing. I.e. simply make alcohol unvailable to an alcoholic, and you haven't cured the alcoholism, he will either revert to drinking as soon as alcohol is available again, or turn to some other method - likely harder drugs to meet whatever need the alcohol was meeting.<br />In short, this is an excellent, and thought provoking book, but with a few flaws of writing that make it easy to misinterpret the author's meaning on some things.	2001-02-17

It doesn't require any familiarity with Blue's Clues for it to make sense and be a good bed-time read. However, if your child (like mine) is a Blue's Clues nut, and constantly scanning for clues, this book may cause some dissapointment at first. He got over it though, and now makes up his own clues as he goes through the book. Good stuff.	2001-02-15

Books	5	20	20	N	N	The definitive book on style	Over the years I've read almost every wardrobe and style book on the market, trying to find something that would help me feel comfortable in my clothing, without trying to turn me into a fashion plate (I'm allergic to the very concept). Then I found this little book, and I haven't read another book on clothes since. Anything and everything you need to know to find your OWN style and develop a simple pared down wardrobe that looks great is in here. Olivia and Amy walk you through everything from evaluating your current wardrobe, to finding your best look, to common pitfalls and fears. It's a little book, but every page is packed.<br />The common thread of simplicity (even if it isn't easy), is also applicable to far more than just your clothing. There's a lot of wisdom in this little book.	2001-02-15

I stopped drawing for years because my sketches in school were consistently considered stiff and too representational. This book got me started sketching again without having to be self-conscious about the artistry of the picture. Her validation of drawing exactly what you see as a worthwhile skill, and quite probably a necessary step on the road to a freer expression was a revelation.	2001-02-13

Most techniques are illustrated, and the illustrations are very clear and helpful. The notations regarding which situations are appropriate for which technique are particularly useful. For instance she shows several different cast-ons for one particular fabric, with discussion of why some are better or worse - for that particular pattern. It had never occured to me before then to learn several different cast-ons for different applications. The historical and specialty knitting techinique instructions are also fascinating, and not something I've seen elsewhere. A better index might help the book to be even more useful, but the set up and table of contents are logical enough that I've never actually had a problem finding what I'm looking for. It's right on my shelf next to Vogue Knitting, and frankly I tend to use this one more.	2001-02-11

James Beard has some wonderful and unusual recipes. I particularly recommend the saffron and sour cream bread recipes. However the book has some serious flaws. His whole grain recipes lack variety and imagination, and his recipes as a whole tend to the unhealthy - i.e. lots of butter, oil, sour cream, etc. in most recipes. So for someone looking to bake healthy breads, this isn't the book for you. If you want a better book for whole grain baking, try &quot;The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book&quot;, which does a magnificent job, and doesn't require that you bake white bread first to do a good job with whole wheat.	2001-02-07

I have an original 1941 edition that I have been reading and rereading ever since I got it. It's not just for the beginner, the novice, or the person who used to play the piano. Anyone who counts themselves as a hobby pianist, or has some problems with enjoying their practicing as much as playing &quot;finished&quot; pieces will garner a lot from this book. And anyone who enjoys piano at all will probably enjoy reading Cooke as he extolls on his beloved hobby. For those who are working seriously at their piano he offers concrete practicing tidbits on everything from how to divide your practice time, to memorizing. His lists of suggested music at different levels are a great place to start if you don't know where to look for your next piece of music. A wonderful, wonderful book.	2001-02-02

Unfortunately, you have to hunt them up, because there are also a number that caused my husband to go &quot;YUK&quot; louder than my kids. Some of the recipes are just plain weird. Pancake Soup? Carrot Mushroom Loaf? It's also not terribly well organized and too tightly bound, so the recipes I do like are frequently hard to find, and when I do find them, I can't get the book to stay open to read them. I would recommend First Meals by Annabel Karmel as a good alternative, particularly for people with younger kids.	2001-02-01

My only real gripe is that nursing moms with babies over about 4 months old need to go read chapter 8 FIRST, before he scares you to death. I was beginning to think that I'd shot my chances of ever being back to my pre-kids weight again (my baby was 6 months old when I read the book) when I hit chapter 8. In chapter 8 he basically declares that the entire timetable as written thus far doesn't hold for nursing mothers. To give the author credit he does tell nursing mothers to check chapter 8 several times earlier in the book. I still would have appreciated even half the time spent on the schedule for nursing mothers that he spends explaining things for non-nursing mothers. After all, there are a lot of us out here.	2001-01-26

Her journey to find out what the true cause of her little friend's death holds some real fascination. Frankly if the last two chapters had held up to the rest of the book, I'd be giving it five stars. Unfortunately the author fails to provide any resolutions. At the end all is known, but nothing is settled. Our heroine is stranded in more senses than one; vindicated, but unable to do anything about it. I wanted to send the author an excerpt from Orson Scott Card's book on novel writing - the section where he discusses how and when to end a book - because this wasn't the way to do it.	2001-01-26

In this story the larger political setting gives our main character Llyn a boost in her quest to find independence from her guardian/therapist when she is both a minor, and a committed mental patient. Despite continuing problems from a prolonged stint in a virtual reality tank at a young age, Llyn is determined to be herself, while her guardian is determined to keep her safe, protected, and controlled. In the end Llyn's problems turn out to be a great and necessary talent. Not as riveting perhaps as some of Tyers' other books, but a cracking good read nonetheless. It will make you think about the difference between protecting and smothering.	2001-01-26

Center is a fascinating world in its own right, as the last bastion of technological Earth. Unfortunately they've become so insular they practically don't know the rest of the planet exists. Ms. McIntyre's writing still has the uncanny power it shows in Dreamsnake that will leave you imagining Center and its people long after the details of plot have vanished from your memory.	2001-01-26

It provides the practical advice on how to pay attention, even in the middle of a modern western life. It's done wonders for my peace of mind (2 small children can divide anyone's attention). There's not a lot of discussion of theory, or why Zen and attention are good or important, simply a lot of ways to achieve them. Highly recommended.	2001-01-24

This book makes regular appearences at our house every holiday. Sooner or later someone pulls it off the shelf and starts reading choice bits aloud, and shortly the whole room is rolling on the floor. It's great fun to read by yourself, but for best effect try reading aloud to someone. Our rule is that when someone can't complete a quote because they're laughing too hard, they pass the book to the next reader, and it's rare for one person to keep the book more than about five minutes.

I actually ended up accidentally reading this series in reverse order (which I don't really recommend). Book 2 (The War God's Own) is the better book in my view, but this one is still a darn good read. My great compliments to Weber for creating the hradini, a fantasy race that aren't elves, dwarves, orcs, or god forbid, halflings. The hradini as a race is a fascinating creation, and their troubles with their racial history even more so. They are a people who've had to do without gods because the gods have explicitly turned their back on them, and our hero's reasons (and his father's) for doing good have nothing to do with edicts from on high, but with sound reasoning, which is very refreshing. Not exactly high literature, but a very good read indeed.	2000-12-30

It did one thing no other puppy book that I had found did, it ran down the basic personalities of a litter of pups - and what kind of people/families the monks thought they would be compatible with. Most of the books I've seen that discuss puppy personalities are far more general if they discuss personality testing at all. The monks saved us a lot of heartache as my husband and I realized that we had been looking for subtly different things in a dog, and needed to get our own thinking together first before we inflicted some poor puppy with the need to be 2 different things to us. The book provides wonderful information on puppy rearing, what to look for in a breeder, what to look for in socialization, almost anything you could think of. Highly recommended.	2000-12-28

Nathaniel Bowditch was beyond gifted, he was a genius of high proportion, but never considered himself better than anyone else simply because he was smarter. At the same time he used his gifts, even when those around him would think he was being a snob for doing so.

Then the series went rapidly downhill. Of the entire (long) list of Black Stallion books only a few really stand out in my mind years later. This is one of them. Perhaps it's because Farley is writing with a new set of characters, and a new horse - a son of the Black raised for harness racing. Whatever the reason there is freshness to the people and plot here that was sadly lacking in most of the later books.	2000-12-16

It's just that the writing, the setting, the side issues, the little tidbits can obscure it easily. The first time I read this book I hated it, because I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on. I bogged down less than halfway through. Then I saw the movie (not very good as a movie, but a darned good plot synopsis for the book). Then I reread the book, now nowing where things were going, and I was able to appreciate the intricacies of Herbert's world-building without getting bogged down in it. He does have a tendancy to overdo, to make his world a little too intricate and obscure, but this is one of the perennial classic SF books with good reason.<br />As a side note, if you find yourself getting too bogged down in Herbert's prose, take a breather and go read the Lampoon's version DOON - the dessert planet.

But if you want clear-thinking, responsible kids, and don't mind some effort getting there, you can't have a better reference. Ms Coloroso's advice is clear, and should make you think hard about how you interact with your children. Yes my son is 3 and I'm 30. Yes I'm the parent, but he still has opinions about his life, and some are worth paying attention to. And sometimes I'm wrong. Being the parent doesn't make me God. Also note, I'm usually in the right, listening means that I pay attention to my sons' opinions and wants, not that I cave in to them every time.<br />Believe me it's much, much harder making a 3 year old take the consequence of a misbehavior, and helping him try to fix his problem himself than it would be to punish him for it and fix things myself, but oh boy does he learn more when I put in the effort.<br />This is not minimum effort parenting, and it's not about letting your kids always having their own way.

What it didn't do was give me any help at all at dealing with the difficulties we encountered. I needed advice on helping my child not to stay attached to my nipple all night, just because I was there, how to get him to sleep before my bedtime, and how to maintain intimacy with my husband, particularly while dealing with the first two problems. All of these have solutions that we continue to work out for ourselves, but this author's comments were not helpful. Being told that sleep wasn't really that necessary, or that I don't really need a sex life was not going to make my husband supportive at all, and I wasn't too happy about it either.

While I learned a good deal about sleep habits and sleep associations that was helpful, I ended up having to create my own method for getting my bright, sweet, incredibly stubborn year old baby to sleep. Believe me I read the book, and applied the method as stated. My little boy cried (read screamed non-stop) for 9 1/2 hours, and my going in every 10-15 minutes soothed him not at all. The next night he fell asleep (Gee, wonder why?), but the third night he was back to screaming for hours and hours. Not for us, thank you. I used the information on sleep associations, and gradually added the ones that would be helpful (dark room, same blanket, etc.), while gradually removing the ones I didn't want (rocking, singing). It took a while but my son sleeps pretty well these days, and I don't think any of us would have survived pushing through and using the outlined extinction method.	2000-12-07

Unfortunately the story is dark almost to the point of becoming a horror book. If the truly dark, grim fairy tales appeal to you, you will love this book. I like mine a little lighter.	2000-11-13

If not you'll probably find it somewhere between irrelevent and thoroughly irritating.	2000-11-11

The only real fault I find is that Roger has a few too many &quot;modern&quot; habits and sensibilities. For instance: A nineteen year old first time mother was not considered young in that time and place. If you like this variety of mystery though, I would recommend it, as well as Ellis Peter's Cadfael series.	2000-11-10

Yes his own personal taste is very &quot;busy&quot;, but no single person has taste that appeals to everyone. If you prefer pastels to saturated color, or few decorations to many, there's nothing in this book to stop you, or even discourage you. No matter your goal (and only you can choose that) this book will take you through the steps to get your room looking the way you want it, from the walls and floor, to the plants and lighting. It's equally applicable to a Victorian living room or a Colonial bedroom, or a Japanese style office (all rooms in my house). I highly recommend it.	2000-11-10

His tracing of a number of the &quot;great reforms&quot; - welfare, community based mental health care, equal oppotunity, etc. and where the best intentions of legislation actually took us is a real eye-opener. <br />He also manages to be notably even-handed, although it is noticeable where his sympathies lie. Both my father and I (at opposite ends of the political spectrum) enjoyed it greatly.	2000-11-08

For a young reader it's probably just right as an inspiring read. However, while there's a good deal of information it's sometimes hard to extract from the text, so it would not be the best choice for say, facts for a paper. For an adult reader the book is still interesting, but some of the liberties the author takes are annoying - I.e. a lot of the book is written from inside Dr. Blackwell's head. Worth reading if you run into a copy.	2000-11-08

Despite never having knit anything from its pages, it is a book I come back to again and again. <br />The book is arranged into short articles, and each provides its own brand of inpiration. Most of the authors seem genuinely in love with their subject, and there is a lot of valuable information on color choices, patterned knitting, 3-dimensional knitting...almost anything to do with yarn and color. <br />While almost none of the pieces demonstrated are anything I will ever knit, many of them have provided springboard ideas for my knitting, and occassionally some valuable techniques. Generally speaking though, if you're looking for instruction, look elsewhere - this is inspiration.	2000-11-06

There are even some breads in here that my husband (a confirmed whole wheat hater) likes! It also taught me how to make whole grain breads without requiring that I be an accomplished &quot;normal&quot; baker first. My copy is covered in flour half the time, I know no higher accolade.	2000-11-04

If that's how you sew, this is a great book. It would also be invaluable for the true beginning sewer. Anybody who sews regularly though would probably not find much new or helpful here. The information is good, solid, and basic.	2000-11-04

Her chatty style may annoy some people, but I found it enjoyable, and her advice on picking patterns invaluable. It's the book I gave my sister-in-law when she was learning to knit. My only real gripe is that the recommended projects in the back are really nothing I'd want to make, so I had to look elsewhere to find a first real knitting project.	2000-11-04

This is the book my mother bought after my family visited Iran in 1972. We've been using it non-stop ever since. The recipes are easy and wonderful The Nane Shirini - persian sugar cookies surprise and delight everyone who has tried them. Chelo is not as hard as it seems, it just takes some attention and careful following of the directions. Most ingredients are standard American stock - no needing to find a specialty store. It's the ways of combining them that make the recipes so different from the same old thing.	2000-11-04
US	50637445	RBNO0YW55I7AD	0312000081	596183253	The Best Cellar	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Good plot - weak details	This is a good mystery (as are most in this series), but it suffers from inaccurate detail in some areas. A friend of mine, who is a librarian, couldn't even read past the first chapter because she kept exploding in horror over the treatment of rare and valuable books. Even I noticed when our heroine casually picks up an old volume on display and just casually carries it back to the curator. Worth reading, but not if you know and care about proper library behavior.	2000-11-01

Unfortunately when I sat down to read I found almost nothing helpful in actually creating a simple, useful room design. Instead there's page after page of beautiful photos, with some interesting but not useful accessorizing tips. For instance, leaving a pair of oriental slippers on the staircase strikes me as more of a navagation hazard than a decorating statement. Also the author's idea of simple seems to have very narrow limits, like using all neutrals with only touches of blue and pink. Or using 1950's style furniture (anybody ever heard of Shaker? Mission? apparently not this lady). If you run into it in a library, leaf through the photos, don't bother reading it.	2000-10-21

While I have had to stop my training for a while due to physical difficulties, I still refer to it regularly as a manual for mastery of self. Mr. Morgan has given his topic a great deal of thought, and his knowlege is categoric.<br />My only wish is that he would have given more thought to the female martial artist, but that may require a female author. Most of his book is broadly applicable to both sexes though, so this is a minor flaw.	2000-10-14

I got to watch my son bounce up and down with glee as he found each hiding critter, and even  after dozens of repetitions it's still one of his favorite books. The  illustrations are both bright and colorful, and realistic enough to give a  good idea what the real animal looks like.	2000-08-16
