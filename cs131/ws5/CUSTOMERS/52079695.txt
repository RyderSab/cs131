I got the impression that Winegardner had been given a list of subjects to cover and he tied up the loose ends from Puzo's book and GII screenplay.     Winegardner made three major mistakes with the book. Michael is not the main character of the story and has been turned into a wimpish idiot, who would not have survived Godfather I. Michael has gone from bashing Kay in the head to letting her make Al Neri uncomfortable guarding Corleone.     There is no sign of the brash, short-tempered Michael of Godfathers I/II, who kills the brother-in-law, his own brother, and has a chilly relationship with Tom Hagan.    The finale attempts to bring back the ruthless Michael but it feels forced and is messy unlike I and II.     Another wrong turn was focusing a major part of the book on Sonny's daughters who were not part of the Corleone crime family and not very interesting.    Finally, he failed to flesh out the characters or events, which made it difficult to become engaged with the story. The book is like watching Headline News, you get the major story but no details.     If a movie is developed from this book, it will probably be difficult to sign Pacino to play the \\"new\\" Michael Corleone.	2005-01-03

Actually, the book and movie part company when Wait and Spearman return to town to avenge the death of Mose. From that point, the book takes a completely different turn while also enforcing the huge difference in the Wait character in the movie.  <br /> <br />The book is okay but it drags from beginning to end. It does not compane with the classic western novels and I imagine anyone reading it because of their interest in the movie will be disappointed.	2004-10-16

The passages explaining the negative aftermath of the Little Bighorn for the Plains Indian because it is overlooked or ignored by history books. <br /> <br />I thought Mr. Welch's decison to weave the Little Bighorn into the story of making the film about the battle made the book more interesting. It allowed the inclusion of unrelated items, such as the gravesite of Bill Thomas, which provided additional background to some of the major points of the book.  <br /> <br />It is an interesting and easy read that would be enjoyable to anyone slightly interested in Custer, Little Bighorn or the Plains Indians.	2004-08-03

The case is interesting because so many questions are still unanswered and there is no clearcut version of what really happened to Reinert and her children.<br /><br />The book has two major problems. The first is a good portion of the story occurs after the book was published. The entire premise of this book is Bradfield and Smith murdered the Reinerts. Five years after the book is published evidence is discovered that Mr. Wambaugh paid Jack Holt,the lead detective, on the case, $ 50,000.00 to ensure Jay Smith was convicted of the murders. Another discovery was the DA withheld evidence that would probably resulted in Smith being acquitted. Both of those facts led to Smith's murder conviction being overturned by the Penn. State Supreme Court.<br /><br />If you become interested in the story, read Echoes, watch the TV-movie which appears on Lifetime several times a year. Finally, you must read the final chapter of the story: Principal Suspect, which provides the conclusion of the legal proceedings but leaves one major question of the case unanswered.<br /><br />Both books and the movie are worth the time spent on them.	2004-05-21

It is written in chronological order, which makes it comparable to fiction novels. <br />The story is a tale of police blunders, hidden evidence by the police, lying witnesses and jilted girlfriends. It will make you question the guilt of current death row inmates because district attorney's and cops will commit felonies to win a conviction.  <br />I read the book because Ann Rule spoke very highly of his writing ability and she was 100% correct. He is one of the best non-fiction, though he could probably cross over to fiction, writers in the world. <br />The murder remains unsolved, though police think they know who killed her, because of a lack of evidence. Bryan Stevenson has received national honors for his work with death row inmates, McMillan has never regained the small tree business that was lost after his conviction.

I second his opinion that reading the book makes you really dislike James Loewen for his arrogant style of rubbing it in your face that he is the &quot;first&quot; person to discover the many errors promoted over time about our history. <br />I teach American history and often point out to students various myths and beliefs, in our history, that are totally incorrect.

This is the third novel by Kirby Jonas that I have read and he continues to sparkle. Though, you can tell this was his first novel because the writing is not quite as tight and textured as his later works, the book is head and shoulders above other western authors. <br />As the title suggests, the book has a sequel, which I am currently reading. Actually, I brought &quot;Seasons End&quot; (Part 2) over eight months ago and put it aside until I find this book, which proved to be difficult. <br />While Kirby Jonas style of writing reminds the reader of other western authors, he adds several layers to his writing which provides a rich textured story that involves you with the characters and provides a story that is not the typical simple plot used by most authors. He is the writer that Louis L'Amour wanted to be and I do not mean that comment as a knock on L'Amour because I have read nearly every book that he wrote and thought they were excellent.

This book ties up most of the loose ends from a murder mystery that is over twenty years old. \\"Echoes in the Darkness\\" and \\"Engaged to Murder\\" were written to close to Smith's trial to provide a conclusion to the story, but they did provide the details of the crime and police investigation.  Costopoulos is able to provide closure for the reader because he is writing ten years after Smith's original trial and after the police and District Attorney have been exposed for unbelievable behavior to obtain a conviction against Smith.  This book convinced me that Bradfield killed Susan Reinert and planned on using Smith's robbery conviction and odd personal behavior to direct the police at Smith and away from him.  Anyone interested in this case should read \\"Echoes\\" before reading this book to get a feel for how Smith was \\"railroaded\\" by law enforcement. \\"Principal Suspect\\" provides the perfect ending to \\"Echoes\\" because Costopoulos has time and facts to answer the the questions left by \\"Echoes\\".  One small footnote: William Bradfield died in prison in January 1998. Among his possessions was a photo of a small stone statue located in woods. People, including some police, believe it is the tombstone of the children. It appears on the Pa. state police web-site about the murders asking for any information that might help find its location.

He is able to provide a fluid explanation to many unanswered questions about the career of Jerry Lewis.<br />He provides a detailed structured background into the creation, rise and fall of Martin and Lewis, which allows the reader to grasp why the act ruptured at the height of its success. Levy is the first writer to really provide concrete answers about the breakup, since both Martin and Lewis have always talked around the issue.<br /><br />Levy also provides a back stage look at the solo career of Jerry Lewis allowing the reader to see why Lewis' post Martin film career, which started with great success was over by 1970. Levy included several lines of an Al Capp, creator of Lil Abner, opinion piece that analyzed Jerry's career and it captured exactly what made the comedy of Jerry Lewis hard to watch after his split with Dean Martin. Capp felt that Martin's presence tempered the shtick of Lewis and made it watchable. Martin restrained Lewis enough that made the wildness of Lewis tasteful and the movies made after the split lacked that restraint thus making the Lewis movies of the 1960s painful to watch because there was no one to tell Lewis when to stop filming a grown man making an embarrassing fool of himself.<br /><br />Though, I do not like the comedy of Jerry Lewis, I have always been impressed by personal interviews where it becomes apparent that Lewis is a gracious person, who has always credited Martin for the success of their act, whether he totally believes it or not.<br />Jerry Lewis has always been more impressive to me when he performed or acted as an adult rather than a child. Personally, Lewis did his best work in the movie &#34;King of Comedy&#34; and the &#34;Wise Guy&#34; television series, which were dramatic roles.	2000-11-17

Ms. Marks has written a book that fills some existing gaps in the  Tombstone/Earp saga. The book makes several strong points about Earp's  lawman career in Dodge City pointing out that Earp was a dependable and  able deputy but performed no feats that would be rememorable in later  years. However, he must have made some impression on the future mayor and  marshall of Dodge City since one chose to leave the town and the other hid  when Earp returned after Tombstone to ensure that a friend was not run out  of business by the mayor.  <br />Wyatt Earp became the most famous western  lawman for three reasons: The first was the OK Corral. Despite what many  people believe, gunfights in the West were extremely rare, almost  nonexistant, which is the reason that the OK Corral became a nationwide  story in the major newspapers of the country. <br />The second reason is the  character of Wyatt Earp, which has been dissected by historians and writers  for most of the 20th century and his character and actions have withstood  their microscopes without a blemish.   <br />Throughout the narrative of the  book, Earp is never found wanting unlike the other major players in the  drama called Tombstone. He was not a cattle rustler such as the Clantons,  McLaury's, Brocius and Ringo; he did not rob stages and he did not attack  his enemies from behind and/or in the night. Those statements cannot be  made by any man that he opposed in the &quot;feud&quot;. <br />The author  points out that Earp was a lawman of &quot;his times&quot;, meaning he  enforced the law with controlled violence, ie hitting his potential  prisoner with his gun, to avoid bloodshed. He should be commended for  perfecting this method since he is known to have killed only one man before  the OK Corral. <br />I do not agree with several reviewers who believe the OK  Corral was the result of blunders or politics. The fight was the direct  result of the Earp brothers standing up against outlaws that had become  used tolawman looking the other way while they shipped rustled cattle out  of Tombstone. The Clantons and McLaury's were too stupid to realize that  Wyatt Earp and his brothers were not going to be defeated in an open  gunfight with them. I always found it interesting that Brocius and Ringo,  the two outlaws that were considered dangerous gunmen, did not confront the  Earps at the OK Corral. The only documented confrontation between Johnny  Ringo and Wyatt Earp or Doc Holiday,(it depends on who is telling the  story) occurs when Ringo is drunk and Earp refuses to take advantage of the  situation. <br />Brocius and Ringo preferred to attack from ambush at night,  which resulted in the wounding of Virgil Earp and the murder of Morgan  Earp. The death of Morgan Earp set the stage for the final reason for  Earp's enduring reputation. Until Morgan's murder, Wyatt Earp had acted  within the boundary of the law regardless of what crimes the Cowboys  committed. Earp realized that the Brocius and Ringo would escape punishment  for Morgan's murder and he decided that was not going to happen. His  &quot;vendetta ride&quot; is recognized by most Americans as a necessary  action against career criminals that used the legal system to avoid  punishment. <br />The book provides both detailed information about the  &quot;vendetta ride&quot; and the geographical setting of the Tombstone  area that other books about Earp do not have. I highly recommend this book  to anyone interested in Wyatt Earp along with two other books  &quot;Inventing Wyatt Earp&quot; and &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;. These three  books totally define Wyatt Earp and his place in American History.	2000-09-04

None of the parents, including Kent's, can escape the  blame for the death of Bobby Kent. <br />This is a well written book that  maintains an objective stance when describing the events that led to Kent's  murder. Though Kent did not deserve to die, his years of bullying Marty  Puccio obviously pushed Puccio to a deep hatred that was brought to the  surface by his friends and the right place and time. <br />The most disgusting  part of the book was the domination of Ali, Bobby, and Lisa over their  parents. I cannot understand any parent who allows a child to disrespect  them and make decisions as if they were providing the income to pay the  bills.<br />An update for this story was recently provided by A&amp;E's  'American Justice'TV series. Heather got out of prison in 1998, Ali, now  known as Alice, can get out in 2003, Lisa had her life sentence reduced to  twenty-five years and comes up for parole in 2006. Marty had his death  sentence reduced to life. <br />Lisa maintains that she knew nothing about a  plot to kill Bobby, she thought Marty was just going to beat him up. Marty  must have been eating his Wheaties since Bobby routinely whacked him on a  daily basis. Ali (Alice, she's grown up) states she had no idea that Marty  planned to kill Bobby(she doesn't talk about the previous night)and was in  a state of shock after Bobby was killed. These girls should have to  exchange their sentences with Marty because they were the prime movers by  the killing.	2000-08-05

He is able to keep the reader interested while providing the necessary details  demanded of a true story without losing the attention of the reader.  <br />This is very difficult to do with true stories, which is the reason that  readers complain about the writing abilities of less talented writers than  Mr. French. <br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone because it is  an intriguing story with little &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence and no eye  witnesses. The story also has the unusual twist of the killer being a  friend of the main investigator of the crime.<br />I can offer an update on  the convicted killer of Karen Gregory. Three year ago, he was instrumental  in developing a mobile crime lab vehicle that could perform various tests  at the crime scene. He was applauded by the police officials that worked on  the project for his tireless devotion to perfecting the crime lab and it  seemed that he was somewhat content with his station in life.	2000-08-02

His book also underlines the reasons that so many people are  turning away from all professional sports. <br />By the way Bob, what did you  do to tick off New York readers? They seem to be the only readers of the  book to disagree with your opinions.	2000-07-13

Perhaps, some readers will find the narrative slow and plodding but if you are interested in baseball, the rich  detail, of the book, that omits no information that would help explain a  particilar point is most welcome.<br />Heylar weaves the familar of baseball  history such as Cobb, Ruth, Mantle, and the major historic games of the  sport with the economics that really drove the game but was kept out of  sight until Marvin Miller stepped onto the stage of baseball.<br />The book is  valuable and unique because of the coverage of the economic underside of  baseball and how the power structure within the game has shifted since the  early 1970s. <br />The book is a must read for someone who is interested in  the real &quot;history&quot; of baseball.	2000-05-21

Remarkable	I read this book several years ago after watching the movie based on the book. At that time, it was a hard book to find (This was before Amazon)but well worth the search. This book is rather complicated and at times the numerous characters are hard to keep separate. Actually, if you read it twice it is  much easlier to follow.    The book presents a detailed narrative of the  takeover fight between Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco, and KKR, the firm  that perfected LBO's. The reasons, stupid mistakes and misconceptions made  by the combatants make the story interesting.      A casual reader might  watch the movie before reading this book to acquaint themselves with the  storyline and characters. However, you should be forewarned that James Garner portayal of  Ross Johnson paints a picture of a likeable person fighting the demons of Wall Street. The real Ross Johnson is more closely aligned with the demons.      The book does leave the reader wanting to know  what happened to Ross Johnson. It appears that Johnson basically retired from the business world. There is little information about him except one small reference to a business venture that failed. He did divorce  Lauri sometime in the 1990s. Kravis also was divorced from his wife in the book.      Burrough and Helyar wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal that attempted to tie up loose ends about the major characters and the eventual sale of RJ Reynolds by KKR. The surprising item in the article was the deal was the top of the mountain for KKR. After the completion of the deal, KKR started a slow downard slide because of infighting among partners, Kravis and his cousin had many partners, and other factors including the financial weight of the RJ Reynolds deal.	2000-05-21

Galarchuk's book \\"Last Train to Memphis\\" provides the answer to  both questions, plus much more.     This book will appeal to readers who are  not fans of Presley's music because it the book describes Presley rise to  the top of the music industry with the hype or destruction of most Presley  books.      A strong point of the book is the early 1950s, the period when  Elvis left behind the life of a shy, poor, and sheltered teenager to become the most important rock star in history.       He also dispels the critics who do not  respect Presley's musical talent giving him little or no credit for the  production of his music. Galarchuk very strongly illustrates that Elvis was  the driving force behind the musical material in the early years before  Colonel Parker took complete control of Presley's career.     The secret of  this book is the number of unfamilar persons who knew Elvis and were able  to provide insights to the man that have never been heard before. The most  interesting voice from these persons was Dixie Locke, who knew Elvis better  than anyone because she was there when he crossed the bridge from the  unknown Elvis into the bright lights where he became \\"The King\\"  and would never be able to go back to the \\"old\\" Elvis again.	2000-05-21

To fully understand why Earp has gripped both American movie makers and the public for the past 70 years, both books must be read.<br />The  major strength of the book is the new perspective on the growth of Earp's  legend; why writers, directors and producers chose to alter the truth of  Earp's life for the various limp story lines developed during the 1940s and  50s, which most people began to accept as fact for the next thirty years.  <br />Readers with a passing interest in Earp will enjoy  Barra's detailed  chapters about the impact of the Earp legend on American culture and the  background information about the two new movies about Earp;  &quot;Tombstone&quot; and &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, which still show up  regularly on television and video stores.<br />Another important part of the  book is the investigation of Glenn Boyer and Frank Waters; two writers, who  have written many books condemning Earp as the villan in the clash between  the Earps and the Cowboys in Tombstone. <br />Several simple facts support the  contention that the Earp Brothers were on the right side. When the Earps  met the Clantons in the famous gunbattle; they confronted the Cowboys face  to face in the light of day.<br />They did not plan a night ambush as the  Cowboys did when they wounded Virgil Earp and killed Morgan Earp or when  Stillwell met the train to California at night hoping to murder Wyatt  without being seen. <br />Wyatt Earp lived the rest of his life refusing to  discuss his Dodge or Tombstone accomplishments. Also, he did not continue  to ring up felony warrants and end up shot to death by a detective; Ike  Clanton did.  <br />Boyer and Waters criticize Earp for the vendetta against  the Cowboys after Tucson(the train attack) but the vendetta ride clearly  shows the character of Wyatt Earp. <br />Until Morgan was killed, Wyatt Earp  had refained from an all out attack on his enemieswho were constantly  planning to kill him. He realized several things: the legal system was not  going to avenge his brother's death; the right thing to do was to bring the  full weight of justice upon the gang; He had the deadly ability to track  down the cowboys and kill them. <br />This is why Wyatt Earp appeals to the  American public; both yesterday and today. He did what need ed to be done.  He compares with other American icons: George Patton, Teddy Roosevelt and  Andrew Jackson to name a few. All of whom did the right thing and were  severely criticized by the more passive persons of their time.	2000-05-07

This book uses the strongest characters from the first novel to good advantage.<br />One small negative that will not be apparent to  the reader until reading the third Stone novel, &quot;Autumn of The  Gun&quot; is Compton's weaving real historical figures into the novel. In  this book, Compton does not distort history so the surfacing figures like  Bill Hickok do not damage the storyline. <br />If you choose to read  &quot;Autumn of The Gun&quot;, you need to consider that Compton's  viewpoint (Which becomes Nathan Stone's viewpoint) about Wyatt Earp is not  supported by historical fact.	2000-05-06

He does not  attempt to hide the seedy side of Earp's life during those years or the  fact that Earp was not above using people or events to advance his cause or  personal gain.<br />The most important part of the book is the detailed  discussion that explains the reasons for the gunfight with the Clantons and  his revenge against the cowboys,for the murder of his brother, that showed  Earp to be more ruthless than any outlaw of his time.<br />It has always  amazed me that movie makers during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, dreamed up  total fiction about Earp instead of using the truth. I have to credit the  makers of &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; and &quot;Tombstone&quot; for correcting  this error. Both movies capture the soul of Earp in different ways. <br />If  you are going to read one book about Wyatt Earp, this is the one to read  because it is the best. If you want to read another, try &quot;Inventing  Wyatt Earp&quot;. It was written about the same time as this book and is  very good.	2000-05-03

After &quot;Autumn of The Gun&quot;, &quot;Border Empire&quot; was a welcome return to the style of writing that makes Ralph Compton a good western writer.<br />Actually, this book is equal to the first two Nathan  Stone novels. The only drawback of the book is the small part of Wes  Stone's dog; a storyline that I enjoyed in the Nathan Stone books, which  showcased a larger part for the two dogs.<br />I also recognized James Drury's  review of the book though he chose not to identify himself. His stamp of  approval is always good enough for me. For the one or two people who might  not recognize his name, he played &quot;The Virginian&quot; on Television  from 1962 to 1971 and made it impossible for me to watch anyone else play  that part, including Gary Cooper.	2000-04-24

I was somewhat surprised that he chose to omit the actual names of law enforcement officials because, in his opinion, they  did a poor job of investigating the crimes. <br />This is a much superior book  to the another book about the murders titled &quot;The Sex Slave  Murders&quot; because it is provides richer detail into the how and why of  the crimes. &quot;Sex Slave Murders&quot; was written 5 years after  &quot;Venom&quot; and is extremely short on facts and the psychological  motives for the crimes.	2000-04-22

This a typical Compton novel that completes the saga of Nathan Stone. It is a good book except when the author continually puts Stone into actual events and attempts to re-write historical events such as the Gunfight at  the OK Corral and Wyatt Earp's time in Tombstone. <br />His betrayal of Wyatt  Earp as an evil force who bullied his foes into the OK Corral fight is so  factually incorrect it is amazing that section of the book got by the  editors. I teach American History and cringe when I see a published work  rewrite factual history as Compton has done in this book. <br />Compton's  attempt to make Ike Clanton and John Behan honorable citizens of Tombstone  while painting Wyatt Earp as the villain is absurb. If an author chooses to  write about historical events, it is his duty to present the facts without  inserting his personal opinions. By the way Ralph, why did you omit Curly  Bill Brucius, Johnny Ringo and H.F. Sills from your book. Curly Bill and  Ringo were the most colorful and interesting characters of the Cowboys and  Sills offered the only totally neutral testimony at the hearing about the  OK Corral.   Anyone who reads this book should also read the biographies of  Wyatt Earp by Allen Barra and Casey Tefertiller. Both of these books were  written in 1998 or 1999 and are well written and researched works. Without  a doubt, they are the best biographies about Wyatt Earp.<br />Any reader, who  is not well acquainted with the true story of Tombstone and Wyatt Earp  should make a point of reading either Barra or Tefertiller books because  Compton has presented a totally fictional story about Earp.	2000-04-13

He was my favorite TV star during the 1960s. He always hit his target as the Virginian and his aim is still good. Kirby Jonas has written a very good book that has peaked my interest in his other books.  <br />A small note to James Drury; I watched the latest movie remake of  &quot;The Virginian&quot; just to see your small role. It would have been a  much better movie if you had played the title role!	2000-04-02
