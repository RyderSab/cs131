Read by Jobeth Williams, this audio was such a gentle and romantic read.  Purhaps too soap sudsy for some of you, but I loved it.  I did not find it to be just like Bridges of Madison County like some had compared it to, and I was very touched by the message in the ending of the story.  I think some of those who did not like Nights in Rodanthe must have missed that message.  Actually, I have read almost all of Nicolas Sparks books and I haven't read one I did not love.  I give this one high recommendations.  JMHO //(*_*)\\	2005-09-09
US	52516111	R2BDC3XU9KTXWK	1597376159	288228634	The Starter Wife	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	Just What I Needed	Having just finished reading a very heavy book, I needed something light and airy and uplifting.  I found Starter Wife to be just what I needed.  I enjoyed the characters and was quickly interested in Gracie Pollack as she began her search for her \\"self\\" ... having been dumped so unexpectedly from her Hollywood executive husband of almost 10 years..... on a cell phone!  Can you imagine?       I listened to this book on the unabridged audio and Susan Ericksen gave such life and great voice to each character.  This became much more than just some Hollywood wife finding herself.  I found Gracie to have great substance.  She was someone I would really like to know.  I really did enjoy this book.

It's been a month or so since I read this so I won't try to summarize this book, but let me say I laughed alot while listening to the audio tape and I was sad when I finished it.  It was very very funny and I'd have to say, better than some of the soaps on daytime tv!  I do hope Finola writes more of these sudsy tales, as she is quite adept at it!  She should be!

This book was incredibly fabulous, just as you said.  I too, will wait for the sequel as I think Cecelia Ahern is a bloody genius as a somewhat new author.  I thoroughly enjoyed \\"P.S. I love You.\\" ... didn't you?    But this book.... OMG!  Genius!  What will we do now that we've finished reading it?    I actually listened to the incredible Anna Fields on unabridged... and her voice just gave it the embellishment it needed... like adding precious gemstones.  I can't stop thinking about these people.    I highly recommend this book to everyone!  I laughed and I cried.... and I ran home to check my email!  Five stars just isn't enough for this book.

I couldn't stop listening to this one.    It started out slow and I almost gave up on it, but then I got totally immersed in the characters.  Margaret and her new boarder, Wanda, whom Margaret likes to call \\"Tink\\" came alive on the pages and with great interest their story takes off.   I loved the characters Irma and MJ and their bowling alley highjinks and was especially fond of Margaret's mother and son.    So pleasantly read by Anna Fields, she gives each character their own identity.   As each new person is introduced into the story I came to care about them and loved the direction that the story took, although it did surprise me.    As it came to a conclusion I found my heart heavy.  You know how it is with a really really good book.  You have to get to the end, but you don't want it to end.  This is one of those books.  Stephanie Kallos goes on my list of authors to watch.  I give this book 5 stars.  Highly recommend.  JMHO //(*_*)\\	2005-03-16

It was so much better.  Fabulously read by Anne Heche and Jane Alexander, the story unfolds of Jennifer who has recently suffered great loss and now her beloved Grandmother Sam is in the hospital close to death.   Returning to the house of her youth, she discovers a packet of letters addressed to her from Sam.  These letters are about to change her life.  They are Sam's story... and Jennifer's story.

Robert Ludlum was one of my favorite authors and Jason Bourne my favorite subject.  When I saw that someone else was hired to continue the legacy I was appalled!  How could this be?!  So, of course, I tore into this audio with great scorn and I was sure I would hate it.  But alas, I loved it.  And I approve of it whole heartedly.  The audio version was read by a brilliant voiced Scott Brick who kept me on the edge of my seat... which was a bit edgy as I read while I drive!  Eric Van Lustbader is new for me, but I believe I shall look into his other books. He did with Jason Bourne, what I believe Robert Ludlum would have done.  Great intrigue and twists.  I'd missed Jason and loved having him back!    Could there possibly be a fifth book in the works?  JMHO //(*_*)\\	2004-08-19

This audio version is fabulous.  Very well done.  I found myself driving out of my way just so I could get in an extra chapter.  This book cannot, in any way, be compared to LOTR. But it does come close to being one of my favorites, next to it.  The suspense and wizardry and wonderful dive into the elvin realm was enough to wet my palet.  The only disappoibtment for me was in knowing that I must now wait patiently for book two.  This young scribe ended Book One so well and with the professionalism of an aged storyteller.  I think that may have even added to the charm of the tale for me.  Kudos!  Bravo!  Well done!	2003-12-30

Their daughter Lissan watched and saw them disappear, and disobeying his commands, stepped into the fairy ring and tried to follow the strange pattern she saw her father walk within the ring, when suddenly she falls back through time to meet Rory O'Connor, who has just led his warriors into battle and she has just fallen, apparently from the sky, into the middle of a battle and more shocking, into the path of a warrior's broadsword. <BR>Luckily, with the magical amulet her mother had pinned to her garment, she has been left her unharmed, leaving the shocked warriors all around to believe she is the \\"White Witch\\" foretolled of. Why is she not dead?<BR>It is now up to Lissan to prove herself to these people and to this very handsome Rory that she is not a spy and not out to hurt them.

It all began with \\"A Sprinkle of Fairy Dust\\" and \\"Emerald Enchantment\\" each book having four short stories. In these books is Marylyle Rogers' story \\"Fairy Dreams\\" and \\"The Fairy's Tale\\" where she introduces us to Lissan, the sister of King Comlan, of the Tuatha de Danann fairy realm. <br />Lissan has fallen in love with a human in this story and has been given permission to give up her powers to join her human love. In giving up her powers to the earth, she leaves an eternal fairy ring of flowers.<br />In \\"Once Upon A Time\\" our Amethyst (Amy) has long heard from her ditsy, yet oh so beloved aunt, to stay away from the flower ring, but Amy longs to sit within the ring to draw. One day, as she draws the countryside, she believes she has fallen asleep and has been whisked away to the fairy land of King Comlan to dance with him and his people in a land more beautiful than any she could ever imagine. But was it a dream?<BR>And then when her aunt introduces her to her friend Comlan, who is the image of her dream man, she begin to question her sanity.<BR>(It seems her aunt is more involved with the fairy people than first we thought!)<BR>This is a wonderful story as Amy struggles with family in England who stiffly want her to marry a man who repulses her and an aunt in Ireland who hints of a better life with this Comlan with whom she is falling in love.<br />And things just get better because as this story seems to end, it continues with the books \\"Happily Ever After\\" and \\"Long Ago And Far Away\\".<br />Marylyle Rogers delivers one of the best magical love stories that I have ever read, and I think that I've read almost all of them now. These people of the Tuatha de Denann will leave you wanting more. They are a wonderous clan. These stories are strong and true and not easily forgotten.<br />You will be enchanted.	2003-04-16

I am so grateful I found this book, if nothing else, for Marylyle Rogers' story \\"Fairy Dreams\\". It relates to the stories she begins in \\"Emerald Enchantment\\" (a collection of short stories) and her's is \\"The Fairie's Tale\\" which begins these stories of King Comlan's clan, of the fairy realm Tuatha de Danann. I have since read the continuing stories of this marvelous clan in \\"Once Upon A Time\\" \\"Happily Ever After\\" and the final story in \\"Long Ago and Far Away.\\" <BR>I am sure that by the time you are done, you will be so in love with this family of the Tuatha that you will be so happy that you, too, bought this book that began it all.<br />Now, not to forget the other stories in this book, as they, too, are marvelous. I truly loved the story \\"Magic and Mahem\\" and the tiny Irish Sprite, Misty Dawn, sent to protect her mistress in the new land.... well, unbeknown to her people back in her Irish homeland. Misty just wanted some excitement and when Shawna was sent to live in the new land, well, what a perfect chance, but to stowe away in her pocket.<br />Equally cute is the story \\"Ever True.\\" Never underestimate the power of your assistant for he/she might just be a fairy!<br />\\"Fairies Make Wishes, Too\\" - what a marvelous story of a young fairy in love with a mortal she watches below her fairie realm. She grieves for the love she'll never know except in his dreams.<BR>When the Queen Fairie forbids young Enya to visit the mortal world she falls victim to the temptations of an offer by an ugly troll who gives her 3 days to win the love of her dream man or loose her life. The catch? She can't tell him that she's his dream lover or that she'll die in 3 days if he doesn't profess his love to her by then. What's a girl to do?<br />Anyway, I love this book! I hope you will, too.	2003-04-16

This book will move you and open your heart.  There is so much love within these pages.  I feel so transformed from the reading.  This story will stay with me for along time.	2001-07-10

No-one can tell a story better than Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones!  I really do wish there could be a way to get a third story out of her.  She's a great read.  Everyone loves her.  If you need a friend, it's Bridget.	2001-07-10

I bought this cassette because I love to &quot;read&quot; when I drive and I love to listen to B.D. Wong.  He has the ability to take you deep into the story and his voices are so perfect to each character.   This is a beautiful story, so full of love and yet so sad.  You feel the pain Hope feels as she and Paul struggle against American prejudice and then as the Chinese cultural revolution threatens to tear them apart again.  I loved the cassette so much I am now reading the book in non-abridged.  It's a real tear jerker, yet it's so satisfying.  What a wonderful love story!	2001-07-01

What will I do without Bridget to come home to at night?  This was the best sequel I've read in ages.  Helen Fielding has managed to surpass even her own first book.  Bridget has gained wit and inner poise in book two and jumped many more hurdles in her attempt to remodel her flat, vacation in Thailand, and to attempt life as singleton with and w/o Mark Darcy.  All the while she still has to deal with riotiously overbearing mother and whithering father, standfast friends Sharon and Jude, long suffering Tom and poor Magda, who has too many children. Between drinks and cigs and daily weight reports, one can't keep from laughing through the entire book.	2001-04-11

I was unable to put it down and was captured from the first sentence.  I fell in love with the character's and their plight.  I resent some readers comment that Ms. Tan has run out of storyline or has stereotyped Chinese.  I strongly disagree.  I am most proud of this story and could relate deeply to it.  Ms Tan, you say next time you will try harder to do a better job... I do not see how that is possible or if maybe your readers are not deserving of such effort.  This was work of your heart.  It made me cry.	2001-02-25

I listened to the Unabridged version of this book and was mesmerized by Graeme Malcolm's melodic reading. I found myself driving out of my way just so I could hear another chapter.  Merrick not only seduced her way into the minds of David and Louie, but her seemingly childlike innocence easily overtakes the reader and makes you want more of her story.  I highly recommend this story to any Anne Rice fan, and my biggest hope is that we have not heard the end of this surprising tale.	2000-11-18

They said this book was for children, but the hoop-la was so fantastic I just couldn't resist.  Since I have no children to read it to and all my friends got to read it with their children, I have to say I felt left out.  Who was this Harry Potter? Everyone I know was talking about young Master  Harry, and there I sat - uneducated - overaged.  So, throwing caution to  the wind, I read my first book this weekend and I'm buying the second book  today.  Who said children had to be aged 9 - 13?  This is some of the best  reading I've done in years.  The writing slides across your mind forging  images that no movie director will be able to recreate.  This Harry Potter  series is sheer genius. I love it!	2000-07-22

I felt like I was with the traveler each step of her journey and I felt familiar to the experiences she was having.  Thank you, Ms MacLaine, for sharing your journey.  I feel something long  forgotten in me that I now must rekindle. Your words were too familiar for  me not to listen.  I hope many more hear you, too.	2000-06-11
