Well Maybe	Everybody knows trolls hide under the bridge and when you cross, they jump out and scare you to death right?<br /><br /> Right.  Except, well, there are trolls, and then there's ORSO THE TROLL WHO COULDN'T SCARE.  He's the main character in a picture book with story by Brad Thiessen and illustrations by Jeremy Balzer.  The team has created  a charming tale and setting, for people aged 3 t0 8, but the story's sure to delight anybody.<br /><br /> Orso Troll lives with his father under a bridge. Mr. Troll takes great delight in frightening people out of their wits, but Orso would rather spend the day climbing trees, walking in the meadow, playing with the animals he meets in the forest, and talking to clouds.<br /><br /> The day Orso turns eight,  he sits in front of his birthday cake wishing he could share it with some troll friends.  But though gentle with him, his father explains that trolls don't have friends.  They're only good for one thing, scaring people.  \\"You have me,\\" Dad points out, when Orso feels alone.<br /><br /> For the reassurance, Orso gives his father a big troll hug.  That tickles, and his dad begs him to cut it out.  Trolls don't give hugs, though Mr. Troll finds himself enjoying the one he's gotten.<br /><br /> The next day, Dad takes Orso under the bridge, to learn to scare the world.  But poor Orso can't even try.  Running home, he cowers on his bed.  His dad accepts that Orso is going to be a nontraditional troll.  Together, they try to think of other things trolls might do, besides frighten everyone.  Nothing comes to mind.<br /><br /> Next morning, two human children, Lizzy and Jacob, meet Orso in the woods.  Orso tries halfheartedly to frightens them.  He almost succeeds with Jacob, but Lizzy laughs.<br /><br /> What happens next brings  a startled response from Mr. Troll, a big change in both Orso and Mr. Troll's lives, and something very special on Orso's next birthday, when he turns 9.<br /><br /> ORSO THE TROLL WHO COULDN'T SCARE empowers children.<br /><br />Brad Thiessen suggests even the smallest youngsater make a big difference in a loved one's life, even if that person is a grown up.<br /><br /> The author also breaks stereotypes found in traditional stories about creatures such as trolls.  He depicts girls as strong, and guys as flexible and willing to examine the lives they are leading.<br /><br /> The troll characters have the gambit of moods.  They grow and change, as good characters should in a story.<br /><br /> Belief in trolls dates back thousands of years,  especially in Scandinavia, but Mr. Thiessen tells Orso's story in 21st Century language.  Illustrator Jeremy Balzer sets the tale in a world neither ancient nor modern.  His pictures  are spooky in a fun way.  They catch Orso's feelings from the joy he gets while swinging on a tree branch, to the terror he experiences when his father roars at the driver of a horse and wagon.<br /><br /> The effect gives ORSO THE TROLL WHO COULDN'T SCARE a timeless sense, and a sense of the harmless fun found in a scary, but make believe, Halloween costume.  It delivers the gentle message that being truly mean is not necessary--even for a troll.  There is another way to get through life.

To me, Kate Horsley's CRAZY WOMAN centers on what happens to people who simply bite off more than they can chew.  Or maybe are never taught to chew it in the first place.  The novel's central character, Sara grows up with a drunken, abusive father, and a mother who refuses to acknowledge the problem.  Unequipped to deal with men, Sara goes offf to college, where she meets a messed up young man who considers sex andsexuality evil.  Still he marries Sara and takes her west to do missionary work.<br /><br />What follows is a gritty portrayl of Sara's mental breakdown in the desert and her return to something that might be considered normal.  CRAZY WOMAN also explores the position of a person on the edge of society.  To survive Sara hooks up with a band of Apaches that pull her in and push her out of their lives.<br /><br />I found myself connecting with Sara's struggles.  We've all been half in and half out of groups at times.  We've all been driven to wits' end about something and more or less recovered.<br /><br />CRAZY WOMAN is a story of a girl with romantic notions who grows up when she has to face harsh reality.  Everybody in the world has had experience with that universal theme at some level.<br /><br />CRAZY WOMAN is thought provoking.  It's not a fun read for a nice fall afternoon.  It's something to sink your mental teath into and chew on.	2005-09-03

That's not true in the case of Pamela Christie's THE KING'S LIZARD.  This history-loving author combined thoroughly-done homework with a great sense of whodun it, to create a murder mystery in old Santa Fe that will have  even the most seasoned mystery reader on the edge of his or her seat.<br /><br />It's the 1770s in Santa Fe, the frontier outpost capitol of New Spain.  Someone wants to undercut the governor's attempt to stop the endless warfare between Navajos, Hispanics, and Apaches.  But who?  The governor calls on Nando to find out.  Half Spanish and half Apache, the son of a respected Spanish don, Nando slips easily between different segments of society.  He knows how to appear and disappear as needed.  Like a desert lizard, he can hide  in cracks and corners, remembering all he hears.  He can also engage people in seemingly innocent conversation that reveals much about them, and about the city's political situation.<br /><br />The Franciscian priest who despises Nando for some reason might be against the governor.  So might the son of one of the frontier's highest officials.  He might also be involved in the illegal trade of selling captured Indian children to Spanish Haciendias as slaves.  Nando's own cousin might have a hand in undercutting the peace process  And what about the strange object Nando finds on the road?  He has no idea what it is.  Could it be the key to the entire puzzle? Pamela Christie has the knack of letting the reader pose, and think he or she has answered those questions and many others before THE KING'S LIZARD comes to a very surprising, but utterly sensible ending.<br /><br />Evewn more fun, she has thoroughly researched the appearance and layout of historic Santa Fe.  Anyone who is familiar with the city will recognize downtown, San Francisco Street, the central plaza, and that wonderful 400-year-old building, The Palace of the Governors.  The Palace is the oldest structure in continuous use in the United States.<br /><br />The  King's Lizard is fun, suspenseful, well researched, and full of suprises.  There's even a touch of romance.  Pamela Christie's style is easy to follow but never boring.

I wired them on October 18, 1922, that I would go, and I left Boston on the 26 in my open Ford runabout.  Today, November 15, I'm at the Winner Hotel in Winner, South Dakota.  I have just finished my breakfast and am waiting for the stage to Rosebud.\\"<br /><br />That entry from nurse Elinor Gregg's diary opens Edna McConnell and Teddy Jones' \\"A Stone for Every Journey Traveling the Life of Elinor Gregg, R.N.,\\" a book that chronicles the adventures of a woman working for the Indian Health Service in its early years. Eventually, Elinor Gregg would became the first Supervisor of Nurses for The Indian Service. But right now, wet weather, winds and muddy roads have forced her to abandon her car.<br /><br />She laughs about the inconvenience, despite the expense of having to house the vehicle until spring.  \\"...It has been worth it in seeing the country and riding with the native.  This the life...\\"<br /><br />The extraordinary life of an extraordinary woman.  After Gregg arrives at the Rosebud Reservation for the Sioux, the reader bounces with her over muddy roads into hospitals containing a minimum of equipment for health care, into Indian homes so remote that hospital visits are almost impossible, and through the touchy political process of working with field matrons.  Not trained nurses, these women have learned basic First Aid but little more.  Now Elinor Gregg must teach them proper care for patients with diseases such as T.B. and trachoma.<br /><br />A nurse herself, Edna McConnell spent her entire career, from the mid 1960s to her death in 2002, researching and writing about Elinor Gregg. Gregg's place in nursing history, and her lively personality motivated the study.<br /><br />Born to a Boston clergyman, Elinor Gregg grew up in an educated family.  Her brothers were doctors.  One sister married a business man.  The other sister became a teacher.  Gregg served as a field nurse during World War I, and as a hospital nurse in Boston before going west. Gregg could also write.  Her lively journal entries bring her adventures, feelings, and attitudes to life.<br /><br />However, \\"A Stone for Every Journey\\" is more than just a diary.  In 2002, Edna McConnell discovered she had a terminal illness.  She turned her research and part of the book's first draft over to colleague and friend Teddy Jones, to finish.  To get her own sense of Elinor Gregg, Ms. Jones talked to her family, and visited libraries and archives from Boston to Santa Fe, where Elinor Gregg died in 1970 at nearly 84.  Jones discovered that Elinor Gregg had a profound effect--for the good--on almost everyone she met.  Her memoirs do not reveal this impact because, like most people, she had no idea how much influence she carried.<br /><br />Jones elected to show this side of Ms. Gregg, as well as her spunky personality and place in nursing history.  So, Teddy Jones invented to fictional student nurses, Alice and Melody.  For an assignment in a Geriatrics class, they must interview an older person about his or her life.  The year is 1966, and the two choose Elinor Gregg.  They set off with a tape recorder from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, to Santa Fe to visit her.<br /><br />Very quickly, Ms. Gregg becomes \\"Aunt El,\\" to them, as she did to to everybody she knew, according to Jones' research.  Her memoirs become transcriptions of the tapes Alice and Melody record.  Gregg's thoughts and actions begin to influence the choices the young women make for their own lives.  \\"A Stone for Every Journey\\" becomes a story within a story.<br /><br />This mix takes the book beyond the level of autobiographical journal.  Jones gives the reader a sense of how Gregg saw herself, and how other people might have seen her.<br /><br />\\"A Stone for Every Journey Traveling the Life of Elinor Gregg, R.N.\\" leaves the reader with fresh admiration for America's pioneering professional women.

Dilly, a city girl married to a rancher, arrives in Carsonville, opens the Friday Shop, and joins the Chamber of Commerce.  From there, she and a group of friends begin to think of ideas to develop  the struggling town.  Some people like the suggestions, and some people don't. Despite the nay-sayers, Dilly and her colleagues go ahead with the plans.  The mayor calls a town meeting.  People like up with dilly and against her.  She looks into the crowd and wonders: will her ideas be accepted?  Or should she give up?<br /><br />With gentle candor, Lucinda Jane Perry captures all the types who live in small towns, the movers and shakers; the dried up old clods, the people who don't care, the people who can be persuaded to consider the possibilities, those who want change from the git-go.

We can get a good chuckle out of the silly notions that impede us all from time to time.  IUnfortunately, sometimes the scenes get repetitious, which slows down the plot, but the descriptions of Carsonville and the antics of dilly, her husband Lea, and her frinds Roz, Janie, and Clarissa more than make up for this defect.<br /><br />anyone who's lived in a small town will enjoy A CAN OF WORMS IN CARSONVILLE.

For the moment, they can  breathe.  But tomorrow, what can they do?  Return to the Mescalero Apache reservation from which they've run to escape the filth, disease, and starvation that killed their father and mother?  No!  They'll remain in the mountains, raiding ranches, until they escape to Mexico, or die at the hands of the white soldiers.<br /><br /> Bin-daa-dee-nin prays to the Mountain Gods for help.  A beautiful--and completely tame--pinto horse appears. The boy can ride it instantly.  Surely this is the answer to his prayer.  Now he can hunt.  He and his brothers might just survive.<br /><br /> But, the army comes.  The Apaches flee one way, and the horse runs another.  Rancher's daughter, Sarah Chilton, finds it.  It becomes hers, until the terrifying night the Apaches come raiding. A boy about her age snatches the horse out of her father's corral.<br /><br /> From this beginning, Albuquerque author Karen Taschek's youth novel, HORSE OF SEVEN MOONS, turns into a frightening turn-of-the 20th Century cat-and-mouse game between two cultures trying to survive in southern New Mexico.<br /><br /> Bringing their opposing lives and values together through the horse--Moon Dancer to Sarah, and Moon that Flies to Bin-daa-dee-nin--Taschek presents the plight of the Apaches fighting to stay free in their home lands, and the anguish of the settlers struggling to protect ranches they have built.<br /><br /> She shows the conflict in realistic fashion, using language that is simple and direct, but never simplistic.  Neither settlers nor Apaches like each other, and neither considers how the other might feel.  Yet, the reader sympathizes with both by the end of HORSE OF SEVEN MOONS. The fate of Bin-daa-dee-nin, Sarah, and Moon-that-Flies/Moon Dancer leaves happiness, pain, and a touch of sadness--as life can do.<br /><br /> Both adults and young people will enjoy HORSE OF SEVEN MOONS.	2005-06-23

Amy comes from a home where drunken parents can't give the damn they feel for her, or her mentally retarded sister.  Rennie's father has married a girl half his age.  They have a baby, leaving little room for Rennie in their lives.  Cherry's mom snorts cocaine, and smokes dope with Cherry.  Once high, they fight--savagely.<br /><br /> Calling themselves The Bitch Posse, the three teens flounder at high school, supporting each other through episodes of bad grades and well-meaning teachers who try break up the group, believing them bad for each other.<br /><br /> The Bitch Posse also rallies together when the harsher stuff hits: screaming fights at Amy's, Cherry's mom unconscious in the john from an overdose, and Rennie's dad just not there when she needs him.<br /><br /> But all that is nothing when real trouble hits-- the kind that alters the lives of The Bitch Posse forever.  Will they work through the mess, and become healthy young adults?  Or will they remain damaged?<br /><br /> Author Martha O'Connor, lets us decide for ourselves by the end of the book.  Shifting from Amy, Cherry, and Rennie's teen years to their young adulthood and back, she puts their lives together like a puzzle.  A picture of incredible anguish emerges, punctuated by aching tenderness and beauty when they gather to help each other.<br /><br /> Through this emotional mix, O'Connor creates real people.  We sympathize with The Bitch Posse's experiences, recognizing in them our own teenage angst.  We also cringe at their escapades, realizing but for strong parents, teachers, or other mentors, we might have made the same bad choices these girls did.<br /><br /> O'Connor guides our reactions by interweaving each character's point of view through story.  She employs direct, and elegant language, changing the rhythm, sentence structure, and sound of her words to mach her characters' personalities, moods, and actions.<br /><br /> Solid scenes support the vivid voices of Amy, Rennie, and Cherry.

Using simple, direct language, Mars interweaves her family's relationships, Shirley's advance toward death, and her own spiritual search for something she can call God, into a microcosm of human experience.<br /><br />A visit to the Church of the Latter Day Saints evokes this thought: \\"My father taught me, expected me, to be tough, to follow my own strong will, and not apologize for it. I did. But secretly, I locked myself in the closet and cried so hard I could not breathe. Waves of sadness washed over me, washing me away, and I was enormously bereft, lonely, scared of everything. That was when Shirley would whisper through the door that she wanted to come in. I would crawl into her lap and drink in her silence.\\"<br /><br />Describing this intimate moment, Mars states a universal truth. Independence can terrify. Everyone needs a safe person and a safe place. Everyone faces the moment when they must lose that security.<br /><br />The combination of universal and personal experience in this and many other paragraphs in the book makes A MONTH OF SUNDAYS: SEARCHING FOR THE SPIRIT AND MY SISTER a compelling, tender, and moving read.<br /><br />So do Mars' frank descriptions of caring for a dying person, right to the moment Shirley becomes so weak, she needs diapers, just before her \\"Final Dive,\\" as Mars calls it, into delirium and coma.

Author Kent Jacobs based THE TURNED FIELD on a true story, which he learned when he and his wife, Sallie, met a man with a tracheotomy scar.  An M.D. with thirty years experience practicing, Jacobs asked him what happened. The answer floored the doctor.  He asked if he could write the tale, and man agreed.  Using narrative and  flashback, Jacobs wove characters, plot, and description into a tale of vivid realism.  For anybody who likes the theme of people against themselves, THE TURNED FIELD is an especially good read.  It's also good for those who like complex interactions between characters, and psychological drama.  THE TURNED FIELD is inspiring and thought provoking.  What happened to Kyle Kendrick could happen to anyone--at any moment.  Who would be tough enough to react to it as Kyle did?  Jacobs' simple, direct style never bogs the reader down in details.  Still, THE TURNED FILED is full of lots of stuff: emotion, love, rejection, Air force lore, adventure, and courage that make it hard to put down.  It's a must for the reading list.	2005-05-09

The incident and good use of sound effectscaught my attention in this audio book about the history of the Santa Fe Railroad.  From that point, Ms. Howle traces the railroad's history from laying the tracks to the latest 21st Century mergers for the line.  She gives the reader a good sense of the business of railroading, and also talks about the Santa Fe Railroad's influence on an important New Mexico commodoty--art.  Agents from the railroad commissioned both Native American and Non-Native painters, sculpters, and designers to create everything from curios to sell along platforms, to tableware for Fred Harvey Houses.  Under architect Mary Coulton's eye, the designs maintained a unifying theme--to sell people on traveling to the southwest.<br /><br />The influence is felt to this day among New Mexico artists, as they sell to the crowd that descends from the sky now for summer hiking and music, and winter skiing.  In addition, Ms. Howle explores the development of the hotel industry, and the social implications of being a Harvey Girl in one of Fred Harvey's restuarant.  IRON HORSES OF THE SANTA FE SOUTHWEST: THE POWER OF VISION is a fascinating look at the politics and sociology of art, business, and daily life as influenced by a corporate giant. Ms. Howle is a master at writing for the ear, so the book is pleasent to listen to and easy to follow.  Unfortunately, it can get dry at times, reading like a term paper.  She might have considered adding music, and environmental sounds, or using actors to read quotes from people involved in developing, running and maintaining the Santa Fe Railroad.  IRON HORSES OF THE SOUTHWEST is a human story that Ms. Howle tells in very human terms.  Let's have some people-sounds to complete the image, since we're using the audio medium.	2005-04-28

This is certainly important to know, as are the signs of abuse and how to get out of an abusive situation.  But WOMEN IN SHADOW AND LIGHT does more than that.  It presents women who have survived abuse and are in the process of healing from it.  Author Jan Goff-LaFontaine interviewed many women about their lives, focusing on how they got out of their abusive situations, and how they made themselves whole again.  Once she finished the interviews, Jan Goff LaFontaine photographed the women, working with her subjects to find poses that they thought best exemplified their healing.  The result is a compilation of powerful words and images that hit the reader kapow--right where they should, in the spirit.  It's enough to send a person soaring.  WOMEN IN SHADOW AND LIGHT is worth getting to know on several levels, first as a metaphor of stepping from shadow to light, second as literal shadow and light in the photographs, and third as a tool we all can use to help each other.  If we know someone who has been abused, this book is the ideal gift.  If we're wallowing in self pity over some trivial thing that happened to us on the way to work, we can stop to ponder how we'd handle ourselves if we really had a problem.  Or if we just want to be inspired by women who got themselves together, we can pick up WOMEN IN SHADOW AND LIGHT.	2005-04-26

Parts are funny, and if you own a dog, they're gut-busting, because you've had similar experiences with your pets.  Parts of the story are emotionally wrenching, as when the heroine, Rae struggles to find the right mate.  Who hasn't done that?  Parts of it are beautiful, such as the descriptions of the Colorado ranch where Rae lives.  Parts of it are fantastic, as when Houston paints the world through the eyes of family pets, who believe they are on earth to help RAE achieve her chosen goal, to find a nice human being to sped time with.  Parts, unfortunaely, are unconvincing.  There are a couple of characters who don't feel real.<br /><br />SIGHT HOUND is a tough read.  Houston writes from several peoples' points of view, and then from a couple of dogs' perspectives.  Thus the reader gets the story by seeing a particular event from many angles, as if putting together a picture puzzle.  For someone with the patience to keep reading, the reward will be a complete picture of plot and character development.  But it takes several chapters before the story starts to come together.<br /><br />But in a sense, that's what makes SIGHT HOUND work.<br /><br />Houston is carefully portraying the madcap life we all seem to be living in the early 21st Century, spiritually, politically, romanticly, socially, and professionally.  The story's main character, Rae, is trying to cope with a career, a succession of male friends and their issues, and the illness of a special pet.  Houston shows us Rae's process in the fragmented bits and pieces our lives become.  Because a reader can recognize something of him or herself in each character's point of view at a particular moment, it's fairly easy to develop the discipline to keep reading.  Then suddenly, the book will not be laid aside until the story comes to its conclusion.  This is very real-life, and in its own way satisfying.<br /><br />I would recommend SIGHT HOUND for the serious reader, who likes unusual plot lines and depictions of the odd moments in life.  In the end, that's what I liked about the book.eader, who likes unusual plot lines and depictions of the odd moments in life.  In the end, that's what I liked about the book.	2005-04-13

As a tiny child, Rebecca lived with her father at his sheep station (sheep ranch in America), and she can't wait to get home to see the kangaroos hopping across the plains, and to be with the father she didn't want to leave when her mother divorced him.  But Rebecca's homecoming is not as joyous as she expects.  In fact it's horrible. Her father has been killed in a wagon accident. A young neighbor of his, Cole, comes to meet her coach.  Another family friend, G.W. joins Cole to her that a sheep ranch is no place for a woman alone.  Her hired man, Ned, suggests she go back to Sidney.  He even suggests Cole might not be the nice, helpful neighbor he claims to be.  Somehow, Rebecca just can't believe that.  She also wants no more to do with her aunt.  Then  Finley, another rancher, makes it clear he intends to have her place as his own.  In response, G. W. makes a suggestion Rebecca doesn't like, but she can't figure out how to tell him.  How can she straighten everything out?  Whom can she trust to help her?  When she finds out, does she want to do it?  Author Karen Cogan poses those questions, and eventually their answers, in simple but elegant prose that describes people, feelings, landscapes,time, place, and action  vividly.  Her writing style makes A FLAME IN THE WIND a page-turner.  So does a twist in the plot as Rebecca and her supports meet Finley in a final confrontation.  A FLAME IN THE WIND is a nice, nice romance with Christian overtones. But it is never maudlin, preachy or mushy.  Add to all of it Karen Cogan's careful research of the Australian Outback and life there in the 1800s, and A FLAME IN THE WIND turns into a nice little fire.	2005-04-08

Using photographs, journal entries, pictures of quilts, and quilt designs, the authors present a picture of just how tough pioneer women were.  With wagons packed to maximum capacity, many walked west, sometimes wearing all the clothes they owned because they had no room to pack them.  When dresses wore out, they got ripped up and saved for quilt squares.<br /><br />But quilts, it turns out, were more than bed covers.  They protected wagons, wrapped the dead, bound injuries, and expressed social and political opinions women didn't dare express any other way.<br /><br />THE QUILT THAT WALKED TO GOLDEN is an interesting read because it reminds us that the saying \\"where there's a will there's a way,\\" might be trite, but it's true.  When pioneer women wanted something, they got it--to the best of their ability, and then left us a wonderful record of their personal and social accomplishments in those magnificant covers.<br /><br />An experienced journalist, Dallas draws the reader right into these women's stories.  Anybody who thought history books were dry in school ought to read this one.<br /><br />Nanette Simonds adds her own special chapter on contemporary quilting.  Fabrics might have changed, but the reasons women quilt, and the uses for quilts remain very similar across time.  Kinda comforting, you know?	2005-03-22

In this case the herine, Lori Shepherd, lives n England in a cottage left to her by Aunt Dimity,.  Lori sets out to find the brother of a woman who died of cancer in a hospital where Lori, a very wealthy woman though no one would know it, volunteers.  With the help of her husband, twin sons, friends, people who knew the dead woman, and Aunt Dimity herself from beyond the grave, Lori fonds out some interesting things about the deseased, and her brother.<br /><br />In AUNT DIMITY AND THE NEXT OF KIN, Ms. Atherton has created a delightful fantasy-mystery.  Aunt Dimity speaks to Lori in a journal. The things she says help Lori think of ways to try to track the missing brother.  The plot isn't spooky, paranormal,  or parapsychological.  It's just plain fun.  Sort of how things might be if we could communicate with a favorite aunt or uncle who has passed away.  That's why I liked it.  AUNT DIMITY AND THE NEXT OF KIN  is the fourteenth or fifteenth in Atherton's AUNT DIMITY series.  It's not a deep fead, but it's great for a rainy weekend, or an evening when you're sick of worrying about the latest discoveries concerning nuclear fission and want to spend some time in the English countryside with Lori and her friends, and Aunt dimity, who believe me is far from dim.	2005-03-21

Some years later, the dream has gone sour.  Divorced, traumatized by the murder of a woman she interviewed at a shelter, and struggling to cope with daughter Hannah's teen years, Maggie finds herself no longer able to write.  On top of that, now she must return home to care for her ailing mother, with whom she doesn't get along. What will happen when she comes home?  What will her mother say?  How will her old childhood chums, classmates, and sweetheart receive her?  How will her mother's friends welcome her?  With open arms? Or by saying she's sold out by leaving?  How will Hannah react when she sees the town where her mother grew up?  How should Maggie handle everyone, including herself?<br /><br />Set amid the scent of fresh sage, and the richness of the earth after a sudden thuderstorm, Maggie's story unfolds as she struggles to answer these questions.  Sharon Niederman has caught the spirit, and to an extent, the spite, a small town can produce in RETURN TO ABO.  But she tempers the naster small town moments with gentle humor, and makes the nice encounters warm and fuzzy.  Having lived in small towns across the country, I connected with moments in the local diner, in the hardwarestoe, on the street, and at the newspaper office.  For that, I especially liked RETURN TO ABO.<br /><br />In addition, Ms. Niederman uses her wonderful command of the English language to describe her characters and their surroundings.  As a New Mexico resident for 20 years, I can ascertain that her pictures are accurate.  I could feel the gritty earth beneath Maggie's boots when she stepped onto her mother's property for the first time in many years, sense the eyes of old tongue-waggers boring into my back.

The only draw back to REUTRN to ABO is the end.  The book ties up a little too neatly for my tastes.

The story could become just another catch-him-before-he-blows-us up loaded with chase scene.  But in Rudolfo Anay's hands, JEMEZ SPRING  becomes much more.  While solving crimes, Sonny Baca also discovers a lot about his Hispanic roots.  He uses this heritage to help in the fight against Raven.  Therefore, we as readers learn about the stories, songs, food, values, and ideas that make New Mexico Hispanics--well, New Mexico Hispanics as opposed to someone else.  And not only that!!  Mr. Anaya skillfully connects that heritage to Greek and Roman myths; and Native American stories.  In this gentle way, he reminds us that no matter who we think we are, or who we think we might be better (or worse) than, we are really all one.  We all need to survive, to love, and to achieve.  Anay's stories show us that we all try to figure out how to do that.  He also reminds us that storytelling is more than entertainment.  Stories transmit our values to the next generation.  That's what I loved best about JEMEZ SPRING.  Mr. Anaya also used the story to play with reality.  As Sonny tries to guess what Raven will do with his bomb, Sonny becomes more and more afraid of Raven.  He imagines so many possibilities that soon, he isn't sure which are real, which might become real, and which are completely off the wall.  Don't we all go through that once in a while.  The two layers together make Raven something more than the run-of-the-mill outlaw, and Sonny Baca more than the average detective.  What they become I will not say, because that's up to the reader.  But I will say that JEMEZ SPRING is a good read.  Enjoy.	2005-03-17

He began the book at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe as a writing student.  It tells the story of his growing up on the Navajo Reservation in the Four Corners.  Much of what he talks about is familiar to me, because I live near the reservation, on the New Mexico side of the Four Corners. I've read about Navajo children going to boarding school, the role of grandparents in Navajo culture, the importance of  visions and dreams to the Navajo, and the work of herding sheep  in other Navajo biographies. What is special about MIRACLE HILL, however, is Mitchell's use of language.  Navajo is a very un-European language in terms of syntax, tense and pronunciation. It's hard for us to learn, if we don't start as babies.  It's also hard for Navajos to learn English, if they don't start very young.  When anybody tranlates from one language to another, they end up with their own idioms--something they put together that wouldn't nornally quite go that way in the language they're trying to speak, but actually comes from their own language. We all know the old Pennsylvania Dutch expression  The milk is out -- meaning the milk is all gone.  This is a direct translation of German, but not totally \\"correct\\" in English.  We must say \\"all gone\\", or \\"we're out of milk.\\"  A German can simply say \\"Alles\\", all or \\"Aus\\", out and it's perfectly gramatically correct.  Blackhorse Mitchell has caught this sense of working between two languages in MIRACLE HILL.  We get a sense of our language through his eyes, and that is a touching and humbling experience.  It is what makes the book good.  It makes me realize how many ways we can use grammer and construct sentences to make ourselves understood.  It reassures me that all human languages are very rich.  We would all do well to learn a couple that are not our own.  Unfortunately, the rhythm of Mitchell's words and his mixing of tenses sometimes makes MIRACLE HILL hard to follow.  This isn't a book to read on the beach.  You need a quiet place to think about MIRACLE HILL.  Once you find that spot and get into the language, it's a good read..

Set in Kent, England, the story follows several generations of the Beavers, a renowned military family, and the cook at their estate, a lady named Alice.  On the surface the plot seems deceptively simple.  Rachel, one of Alice's grand nieces, wants to publish a book of old recipes Alice has asembled.  But be careful.  That is only HARRIET HUDSON'S cover for something a lot more interesting and complex going on between Rachel's family and  the Beavers. Rachel finds herself uncovering it.  When she finally understands what it is, literally in the last few pages of THE WINDY HILL, she must make a decision herself.  Her choice gives the story a wonderful true-to-life ending, after  260-some pages of twists, turns, disaster, and intriegue.  Like a light but satisfying dessert, the end of the story sets off a delicions and spicy meal.  But HARRIET HUDSON does more than just create a wonderful mystery. Through careful research, she gives a good picture of what life in England must have been like between 1910 and the late 1970s for both upper class people, and the staffs that supported them. HUDSON also takes plot twists one might expect in a Master/Servant relationship story, and sends them spinning in an unexpeced direction.  As a result, Rachel might not be who she thinks she is.  Alice might be somebody else too.  And the Beavers family?  As well as two young men who seem to be as interested in Rachel as in the cookbook? Ha!  Wouldn't you like to know what they turn out to be.  Go read WINDY HILL. You will have a blast.  I promise.  I frankly took it out of the library because it was near closing time, and I hadn't found anything that really turned me on, and the library staff was giving me gentle but demanding stares.

Rocio's discovery that Mama couldn't protect her from all harm, that evil lurked in the world, and that people could be manipulative and downright vicious over nothing resonaged particularly with me because of some of my own childhood experiences.

The book also reminds us that certain things about human nature don't change.  Using a mix of scholarly research and the retelling of ancient Celtic myths, SQUIRE examines how ancient Celtic gods and magical beings expanded, contraced, grew, disappeared, and reappeared in popular culture from the time people arrived in the British Isles and France to the present. He suggests that with each wave of immigrents, Celts, Vikings, Germans, Romans, Christians,  new beliefs mingled with old. New gods replaced old, but ancient ideas lingered.  Looking at story themes, plots, characters, and icons, Squire shows how these thoughts have come down to us today.  I liked this book for that reason.  When I finished reading it, I felt connected to ancient people.  I also felt connected to modern people because the stories embodied in myth are universal.  CELTIC MYTH AND LEGEND is also a book I can read on several levels.  If I want to read some neat stories, I can pul it off the shelf.  If I want a good of example of how scholars compare and contrast legends and draw conclusions about their origins, I can grab this volume.  If I would like to simply be reminded of my humanity, I can thumb CHARLES SQUIRES' pages.  My only complaint about CELTIC MYTH AND LEGEND is that SQUIRE'S language can get heavy.  He often goes on for pages describing comparisons and characters in minute detail.  This is not an easy read. Still, CELTIC MYTH AND LEGEND is a good reference book for the scholar, storyteller, or person who has more than idle curiosity about old tales.	2004-12-10

Set in the 5th Century, Gundrun's Tapestry follows the adventures of Sigfried, Brunhilda, Gundrun, and the gang in the ancient Niebelungen Saga. Scholars think this legend tells the history of the arrival of the Huns in Europe, and Schweigherdt gives us that history with full measure, woven into a thrilling plot that fills out the action of the legend, and adds exciting twists that keep even an old Niebelungen Hound like me turning those pages.  I just loved seeing the story come alive under Schweighardt's pen (well actually keyboard, I'm sure.) I got a sense of the clothes, the food, the houses, and the life styles of people both living with Atilla, and living in the Europe through which he rampaged.  Everyone felt as real as anyone walking the streets today.  Characters in an ancient saga are usually larger than life and heroic.  That's okay for the version written inthe 5th Century. That was the style in those days.  Today we like reality charcters with warts as well Christy Brinkley looks, and Gundrun's Tapestry has them.  For example, Brunhilda is attractive, yes, but her eyes are watery.  Siegfried is handsome and bold, as he should be, but he can also be a touch cocky.  His enemies?  Well, some are bold.  Others?  Shhhhh!  I 'm not explaining, because finding out about them made good reading for me, and I want it to for you as well.  Another neat thing about Gundrun's Tapestry is the main character's perspective.  It isn't the kind of person who normally has much to say in a traditional Norse Saga.  Again, I'm not saying why.  You will have to enjoy the discovery for yourself, and believe me, you will.  Finally, understanding the title of the book comes at the very end.  Learning that was fun too.  Best fo all, the enjoyment came in an elegant but easy-to-read style.  For me Gundrun's Tapestry and Joan Schweighardt blew the dust off long forgotten memories of Medieval History Class.  For people who have never had any Medieval History, here comes a wonderful introduction.off long forgotten memories of Medieval History Class.

DARK WATER DIVE is one of them.  The heroine, Hannah Sampson arrives in the British Virgin to take a job as an underwater investigator for the local police force.  Ideally, she will escape the hideous crime scene she encountered regularly as a Denver officer.  Of course, she promptly gets involved in a couple of murders, a bunch of robberies, and a dangerous dive into a cave off limits to tourists.  While solving the crimes, she still finds time to romp on the beach, enjoy  romance, make new friends, live on a sail boat, and play with her dog, Sadie.<br /><br /> A hot-shot young cop tries her patience when he drives the police boat full throttle, and an environmentalist gets into too many faces for her own good, forcing Hannah to keep watch on her.<br /><br />All this action, set against the back drop of the British Virgin Islands makes a light and lively read. Ms. Brandt's experience as a skin diver adds a touch of reality to the book.  She gives a good picture of diving procedures, and the sensaiton of diving, without boging the reader down in a technical manuel.  She also talks about environmental issues and touches on mental illness.  This adds depth to DARK WATER DIVE. The plot has plenty of twists and turns to keep the reder guessing whodun it.  DARK WATER DIVE is perfect for the beach, the airport, or Saturday afternoon.  I enjoyed it.	2004-10-27

Some of the people who send me stuff should read THE FRUGEL BOOK PROMOTER.  Carolyn Howard-Johnson is full of ideas on how to focus promotions, and how to make them attractive to any medium--radio, TV, the net, print, and more.  To grasp all the information she's managed to pack into 243 pages, counting the index, would take multiple readings.<br /><br />Though aimed mostly at authors THE FRUGEL BOOK PROMOTER can be useful to anyone doing publicity.  Ms. howard-Johnson's ideas adapt as well to the Red Cross as they do to a hot romance to read in the airport.<br /><br />I think THE FRUGEL BOOK PROMOTER will be a dog-eared reference on my writer's shelf both at work and at home until it falls apart from over work, and I have to spring for a new copy.	2004-10-26
