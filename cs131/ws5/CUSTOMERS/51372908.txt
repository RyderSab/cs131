This book is mostly a belated coming-of-age story:  a woman who learns the ropes in a new career, and eventually finds confidence and freedom in it.  She discovers unimagined intensity in love affairs, and is swept into various types of adventures under the tutelage of male lovers and acquaintances.  Her father dies, and she achieves a somewhat more mature relationship with her mother.  She divorces, remarries, struggles to have children against the ticking biological clock. <br /> <br />In the midst of all this, a lot of luscious food does appear, of course, given her job.  But the actual descriptions of all that luscious food somehow feel strangely distant from the main themes of the book, which appear to be a general celebration of feminine independence as Reichl understood it, reveling in the pleasures of life, and the importance of following one's dreams and intuition.   <br /> <br />So in the end, \\"Comfort Me With Apples\\" is at heart just a decent memoir.  That memoir happens to be set in the world of food criticism in California, so it does have a fair amount of background color from there, but deep-down it is not really about that world.  If you go in expecting much more you will likely be disappointed.	2004-11-21

Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature. <br /> <br />This is a book to read alone or with a partner, to give and receive, to go back to again and again. <br /> <br />Note: the excerpts available in Amazon's \\"Search This Book\\" facility unfortunately do not do \\"The Prophet\\" justice, since only the book's introduction is included, whereas the wisdom does not begin unfolding until a bit later.  Therefore I've taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran's writing.   <br /> <br />--- <br /> <br />And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, \\"Speak to us of Children.\\"  <br />  And he said:  <br />  Your children are not your children.  <br />  They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.  <br />  They come through you but not from you,  <br />  And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.  <br /> <br />  You may give them your love but not your thoughts.  <br />  For they have their own thoughts.  <br />  You may house their bodies but not their souls,  <br />  For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.  <br />  You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.  <br />  For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.  <br /> <br />  You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.  <br />  The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.  <br />  Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;  <br />  For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.	2004-11-21

It also has New Age-y sub-themes that will put off some, but that's another matter.  <br /> <br />The book's basic point is sound -- honesty is the best policy.  However, the implementation of that policy, as described in \\"Radical Honesty\\", is not very nuanced.  It is a shock program most properly applied to people who are consciously or unconsciously living out self-destructive scripts that they internalized from somewhere or another, for people who are being deeply, fundamentally dishonest with themselves and with others.  It is for people who could use a real shaking up, to break free from the false security and real stress of a false persona. <br /> <br />That's fine as far as it goes.  However, if you were to apply the principles of radical honesty indiscriminately in your daily life, you would be a jerk, basically, and you wouldn't be able to get anything done in society.  It's best considered for bringing health to broken intimate relationships among adults. <br /> <br />On this point, a quote from Khalil Gibran comes to mind: <br />\\"If indeed you must be candid, be candid beautifully.\\" <br /> <br />The stark candidness prescribed in \\"Radical Honesty\\" is not beautiful, it is raw and ultimately self-centered.  It's for emergency use, like approaching the task of redecorating by burning your house down and starting over. <br /> <br />That said, personally I found the author's brash style to be refreshing and likeable.  As always, the reader should just extract the personally valuable stuff out of his collection of techniques and his overall message, and simply ignore the rest. <br /> <br />For a much less strident romp around the topic of how to have healthy adult relationships, check out \\"Life and How to Survive It\\" by John Cleese and Robin Skynner.  It's a very thoughtful and engaging read.  Don't be thrown off by afterimages ofCleese's Monty Python silliness -- he has a wonderfully incisive mind and does a fine job as co-author of this work on the practical psychology of healthy living.	2004-11-21

The author is also an experienced book editor, and he uses those skills to blend the experiences of nearly 50 other fathers of various backgrounds as he compiles this almanac of observations and seasoned advice.   <br /> <br />The style is matter-of-fact yet sympathetic; pragmatic, down-to-earth, and engaging.  The content is fair and balanced, offering varying points of view on many details of child-rearing, and does not preach.  And while fairly nuanced in this way, on the other hand, it's not wishy-washy and \\"anything goes\\" about things -- it's also crisply authoritative in areas where there is just one no-nonsense way to go.  E.g., the dangers of older cribs and the maximum recommended gaps between slats, or other safety issues not really open to much experimentation.   <br /> <br />Overall though, the book is refreshingly descriptive rather than prescriptive.  It's a nice mix of specific, often creative suggestions along with a general philosophy of caring, healthy, and personally appropriate/satisfying fatherhood. <br /> <br />The Almanac will make an excellent gift for fathers of newborns or young children -- up to approximately kindergarten, I'd say, although some of the material is appropriate for even slightly older children too. <br /> <br />Note: although even the more recent edition feels slightly dated simply because the pictures are old, the material itself is all still relevant as far as I could tell.	2004-11-21
US	51372908	R3VJ9SX662Q6BL	0140067477	446789245	The Tao of Pooh	Books	5	7	8	N	N	a charming stroll with Pooh, the unintentional Taoist master	In \\"The Tao of Pooh\\", Benjamin Hoff uses the personalities of the characters in A. A. Milne's tales to illustrate Taoism alongside some competing worldviews.      The characters can divided into 3 categories of personality and philosophy: Rabbit/Owl, Eeyore, and Pooh.      Rabbit quickly develops and executes clever action plans that don't capture the essence of a given situation and usually go awry.  Similar to Rabbit in terms of being too clever by half, Owl pontificates and analyzes and never actually does anything.  Eeyore is also clever in his own way, but interprets everything negatively and is bitter and ineffectual.  Whereas Pooh ambles along without the brains of the others, but with a stout heart, and muddles through to contentment.    Rabbit/Owl together embody logical analysis, clever planning, and ceaseless but largely misdirected hard work. The aim of all their analysis and effort is to exert maximum control over outcomes by actively 'understanding' and intervening in every situation.  In the Eastern tradition, this approach corresponds to Confucianism, a very rigid and circumscribed approach to achieving harmony.  In the Western tradition, the Rabbit/Owl approach seems very familiar, as the general attempt to organize and control our physical and social environments with logical tools and techniques is integral to the Western experience.  The Rabbit/Owl approach regrets the past and worries about the future.    Eeyore represents knowing resignation.  The aim of this hopelessness, and the ensuing lack of commitment and activity, is to shield oneself emotionally from the risk and reality of failure.  In the Eastern tradition, this approach corresponds to Buddhism, which counsels that our world is illusion and suffering, and the best response is to actively disengage from it all. In the Western tradition, the Eeyore approach can be construed as loosely analogous to the easy cynicism and disengagement of the many people who are alienated by the overbearing and omnipresent Rabbit/Owl aspects of society.  The Eeyore approach sees endless failure in the past and inevitable failure in the future.    Pooh, on the other hand, embodies warm-hearted, inclusive, and spirited enjoyment of what's happening in the moment.  He unconsciously embodies the fact that we cannot control the infinitely complex interplay of forces and events out there, so the healthiest response to this overwhelming reality is to be true to our inner nature and in so doing, accept being part of the great flow of things.  In the Eastern tradition, Pooh's approach is Taoist.  He does not worry about the past.  He does not worry about the future.  He simply is himself, now, enthusiastically.  He is simply honest and true to his friends and to his own nature.  To Pooh, 'things are as they are', and do not need constant worry, analysis, self-doubt, and striving, unlike the flustered Confucian-Rabbits.  But at the same time, he is quite engaged in the world, unlike the fatalistic Buddhist-Eeyores.  When he wants hunny, he goes about getting it, quite tenaciously at times.  When he wants to help a drowning Roo or Eeyore, he rushes to save them with whatever's handy.  And so on.    \\"The Tao of Pooh\\" is overall a charming read.  Hoff does a good job of maintaining the whimsical tone of the original Pooh tales, painlessly conveying some fairly abstruse concepts about the nature of reality and perception.      To be fair, it should be noted that there's a bit of apocalyptic sermonizing at the very end, to the effect that the Owls and Rabbits of the world will destroy everything if we don't learn a better way to be. Also some readers will construe Hoff's periodic mild teasing of the Rabbit/Owl way as irritating intolerance, hypocritically un-Taoist. Personally, I do not take his teasing that way at all;  Taoist hermits probably did not show much deference to the great Confucian bureaucrats of their day!  To me, these are minor and forgivable blemishes in a book that otherwise has a deft, light touch, though not as light as the childlike wisdom of the Way that it hopes to explain.	2004-11-17

The title refers to the progression of material-driven stages of human progress -- the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, etc.  In \\"the Diamond Age\\", matter compilers can easily create diamonds out of raw carbon.  Basic foodstuffs and many other material wants can be satisfied by these matter compilers.  This has created a world in which no one need starve.  However there are still tremendous disparities between rich and poor, because many human comforts such as entertainment and fine food still require the services of other people, which must be bought in hard currency. Networked nano-technology is all-pervasive, with microscopic robots putting these poorer citizens under constant surveillance.  Faced with this hyperactive stew of technologies, ancient instincts and traditions run strong. Crime, poverty, and tribal conflict are still rampant in this world.  People cling to old ways of thought (a strong Confucian motif runs through the book) to help make human sense of the rapidly changing world.  <br />Against this backdrop, a fantastically advanced piece of technology (a sentient child's primer) is stolen, and winds up in the hands of a destitute young waif named Nell.  Her resulting world-class education, and what she does with that education, is the binding for the various threads of the story.<br />The book's characters are well-realized for the most part, the writing style is honed and mature, the plot is intricate and engaging.  The ending is controversial in its ambiguity, but that does not diminish the power of the book as a whole.  In all, a very thought-provoking read.	2004-07-11

Compared to that book, which reads like a laundry list of tips on cutting down on laundry, this one is more reflective.  It has fewer bite-sized &quot;tips&quot;, and more thoughtful, open-ended suggestions.  I found its tone still gratingly 'yuppy' in places (e.g., &quot;i can't help having an emotional attachment to my BMW&quot;), still 'Martha Stewarty' in others (e.g., yet more discussion of linens) but these were less frequent than before.<br />&quot;Living the Simple Life&quot; appears to be aimed at those who simply are over-burdened and want off the rat-wheel to have more time for families and hobbies.  This is fine insofar as it goes, but I'd have given 4 stars if there had been any mention of the simple life as a route back to a life of community, how the simplicity movement relates to a larger yearning for a healthy society.  Many see the simplification movement as vital to maintaining a healthy human presence on the planet, since our atomized, resource-gobbling, materialistic society is  transforming into a less livable place in many ways.  Lowering our consumption and getting in touch with each other and our roots seem like a natural, healthy response. However this connection either did not occur to the author, or it was edited out.  There was a brief passage on having time to volunteer, but the other 340 pages were about personal goal-setting, time management, motivation, self-assertion, and other mechanics of simplifying.  Personally I think not mentioning the larger implications of the act of simplification, i.e., beyond one's personal gain, made the book a bit shallow, although it's still much better than its predecessor.	2001-09-05

This is by definition -- they cannot serve as a basis for ethical action, since they culminate in inaction.  <br />In a very brief outline of the development of ethics, he sweeps through the Greco-Romans, Hebrews, early Christians, Erasmus, Bentham, Hume, Kant.  <br />He concludes that ethics cannot be rigorously supported by a philosophical framework.  Any attempt to justify altruism is logically flawed. It is entirely subjective.  Science leads us to understand more of the physical universe, but in such a way as to strip its human meaning.  Ethics is irreconcilable with observations of a predatory phenomenal world.  [Note: Schweitzer's invocation of survival of the fittest here does not gibe with Darwin's original concept, and our modern understanding, of the workings of ecosystems, predicated on survival of the fittest _within a fitting ecological niche_.  That is, there is great inter-individual competition but ultimately an elegant inter-species cooperation, the spirit of which might be close to what Schweitzer is attempting to articulate.]<br />Schweitzer claims that the culmination of the search for a rigorous underpinning to ethics results in the realization that all creatures are common in their will to live, so &quot;Goodness is: preserve life, promote life, help life achieve its highest destiny.  The essence of Evil is: Destroy life, harmlife, hamper the development of life.&quot;  Hence, the title of the book.  The point seems to be that, in his opinion, soul-searching for the core of altruism will lead one to revere life for its own sake, including non-human life.  This reverence should permeate all our actions.  <br />From what I could tell, this is essentially no more than his passionate opinion.  I found the arguments to be loose and unconvincing, simply a discursive description of the author's compassionate frame of mind.  Still, it is impressive to hear a profoundly good person describe the nature of his compassion.  Reading beyond the somewhat rambling message, beyond to the man himself, I found myself musing on recent small compromises and personal pettiness, by contrast with Schweitzer's will and heart. <br />Anyone inclined toward the environmental and animal welfare movements will find a champion in Schweitzer, who stressed the interdependence and unity of all life.

I closed the book absolutely revulsed by the nature of this technology and how it has manipulated us.  I can anecdotally attest to its ill effects in my case, certainly -- I can recognize thousands of brands but only a few plants.  My direct knowledge of the world has been reduced by about 20,000 hours' worth of actual experience interacting with real people, time that I spent instead glued to the boob tube, absorbing hundreds of thousands of commercials. I don't have a TV anymore, but whenever I am around one that's turned on, I find myself hypnotically drawn to stare at the screen, irrespective of content.  This occurs even if I am in the middle of an interesting conversation -- to my embarrassment and dismay, my eyes dart as of their own accord toward the flickering images.  I have to stand facing away from the TV to prevent this.  What I consider to be my natural aesthetic sense has been perverted such that I can hardly look at a man or woman -- or myself in a mirror -- without automatically, subtly judging the person's appearance against an internal metric, a deep and narrow palette of beautiful faces and lithe body parts, implanted by hundreds of thousands of advertising images.  This phenomenon subtly cheapens and distorts many interactions I have with people.<br />....<br />Just scan the table of contents to Mander's book, ..., and you will begin to see the array of influences these forces have in our culture and in our individual minds.<br />Please buy the book, give it to everyone as gifts this year, ***especially to parents of small children***.

Real life simplification for many people, myself included,  has meant painfully recognizing and kicking away many ego crutches, summoning up the discipline to let go of a lot in order to focus on what really matters. <br />To her credit, the author has a significantly deeper take on this whole process in her later book, &quot;Living the Simple Life&quot;.  That is recommended as a complete replacement for &quot;Simplify Your Life&quot;; don't waste your time on it unless your intent is just to free up a few hours in an otherwise unchanged lifestyle.<br />Also consider &quot;Voluntary Simplicity&quot; by Duane Elgin.  It offers a sociologist's perspective, which is a bit dry but includes opinions of dozens of people he encountered in his research on the nationwide movement toward a less materialistic, more relationship-oriented style of living.	2001-09-05

Diseases are classified as &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;, the tongue is examined minutely (a chief clue in Chinese-medicine diagnoses), the meridian-system is described alongside the overview of standard Western physiology.<br />The didactic emphasis is on disease as merely an initial factor in upsetting the body's natural balance, or perhaps more accurately, an opportunistic intruder upon an already out-of-balance system.  Treatment might entail a frontal attack on the factor but more often it seems to entail encouraging the body to regain its balance.  The Western notion of balanced systems -- homeostasis -- is only a part of the balance in question.  Homeostasis is understood as a purely physical process, but in Chinese medicine the mysterious flow of qi energy is even more important than the flow of physical fluids.  The completely matter-of-fact presentation of such concepts which most Western doctors would consider mysticism is the main charm of this tome.	2001-09-05

I dislike this brand of recycling effort because it shifts responsibility for the environment almost entirely upon the consumer.  Certainly it is laudable to be responsible and aware of environmental issues in our buying choices, but the fact of the matter is that perhaps 1% or 2% of waste is directly generated by consumers.  The remainder is generated during various production and transportation processes leading up to the sale.  Trying to wade through thousands of products in an attempt to buy green simply obscures that key fact.  Naturally that's in the interest of corporations themselves, who are all for having municipalities and private citizens bear the brunt of recycling labor and expense -- yet another cost of production successfully externalized out into the community.<br />This kind of book should simply be unnecessary -- ALL products should be 'green'.   It is simply common sense: our resources are finite, but our systems are geared toward infinitely-growing production and consumption.  Clearly, our systems must change such that the great majority of products are sustainably produced.	2001-09-05

The authors describe how the implementation of the Alma Ata Declaration was progressively diluted in practice, from \\"Comprehensive PHC\\" to \\"Selective PHC\\" to a small set of specific medical interventions, until in some places it consisted only of distributing oral rehydration treatment (ORT) packets to treat dehydration from diarrhea, plainly not a long-term solution. The authors challenge the following concepts which typically surface in the philosophy of organizations such as WHO and UNICEF which are sponsored by powerful conservative entities: 1) technological solutions to fundamentally social problems<BR> 2) survival alone is a sufficient goal, in practice (i.e., 'quality of life would be ideal, of course, but that's unrealistic')<BR> 3) if we can educate the natives on the basics of nutrition and sanitation, and if they can change their ways, they'd be all right<BR> 4) UNICEF's shift from bottom-up to top-down approaches<BR> 5) \\"social marketing\\" is a viable approach, which serves economic as well as public health goals. (where \\"social marketing\\" is the mass-marketing, using conventional advertising techniques, of ostensibly beneficial goods such such as ORT packets, typically imported from the West or profiting its domestic representatives) Part Two A detailed expansion of the above points with regard to a specific intervention, ORT, as well as a lot of grounding detail on the specifics of its application and functioning, down to the level of the physiology of its absorption. Part Three Criticism of World Bank Structural Readjustment Policies .... Examines the behavior of \\"killer industries\\" - infant formula industry, pharmaceuticals, and arms industry. Examines the effects of US-style approach to health care and social equity within the US itself. Looks at alternatives in Cuba and Guyana. Argues that social equity is the real solution to population growth and AIDS. Part Four Examines markedly successful approaches to health care based on social change. Presents examples from Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Notes that efforts in all four countries have been seriously or completely derailed through intervention by the US, which is concerned that a functioning alternative will upset the current status quo by which it maintains profits and security. The book closes with a call for a united front of grassroots efforts, and offers suggestions for teachers, writers, health workers, activists, concerned citizens.	2001-08-25

Chomsky has done a lot of work to get us started on the road toward being informed citizens, gathering an astounding body of evidence indicting 'state capitalism', as practiced predominantly by the United States. His presentation is concise and down-to-earth. Being a distillation of his other books, this booklet borrows their formidable scholarship, which draws largely upon publicly available references (e.g., those released under the Freedom of Information Act). The basic premise is that the US government has engaged since WWII in a coldly calculated campaign of maintaining its position as the preeminent economic power in the world. To do so, it has supported murderous, repressive regimes and/or actively encouraged chaos in order to destroy any successful examples of socialism in the Third World. Examples in the book include Chile, Indonesia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama, Grenada, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, among many others. It then describes propaganda campaigns waged to keep US citizens uninformed and accepting. It is a classic political maneuver to invoke a foreign threat to consolidate power at home and deflect attention from the real issues. According to the book, the government did this in invoking the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; and declaring a &quot;War on Drugs&quot;. The bitter irony, of course, is that our own empire-building has been at least as evil (in terms of violence against citizens and repression of human rights) as the Soviet Union's, and that we are the world's largest exporter of addictive drugs (our tobacco has killed tens of millions worldwide), while abetting known drug dealers as long as they help us maintain regional control. &quot;What Uncle Sam Really Wants&quot; might change your understanding of what the power brokers in our society mean when they deploy terms such as 'democracy', 'socialism', 'communism', 'free enterprise', et cetera. The book should not be dismissed assimplistic just because of its abbreviated format. Especially if you haven't encountered Chomsky before, this quick little read might well significantly alter your worldview. Chomsky concludes the book with the hope that it will engage you further in the struggle to maintain a democracy guided at least as much by ethics as it is by economics.	2001-08-24

[...] Its verse, while observing elegantly the requirements of metre and rhyme, is able at the same time to achieve the rhythm and feel of the most natural and ordinary colloquial speech.&quot;<br />&quot;We [...] must work out for ourselves the answers to a number of riddles the work proposes.  What is the true nature of art?  Where do the boundaries between literature and life lie?  Or are there no boundaries, only a tangled network of intersecting threads that connect the lives we lead with the books we read?  Perhaps, as this thoroughly modern and timeless work suggests, we are unable, despite all ours strivings for personal 'authenticity', to be anything but the roles we play, the products and playthings of literary and social conventions.

More generally, it is about the various ways we express the search for meaning, about gradually lost causes, about vulnerability and kindness, about the complicated dependencies of marriage, about coming of age, slowly, over the course of a lifetime. The plot is simple -- two couples meet because the husbands teach for a time at the same campus, and the four become lifelong friends. Although the story spans decades, there are very few dramatic incidents. This lack of external drama may disappoint those who like plots which move steadily forward, driven by significant events and bold action. However that very lack of action and heroism is part of the novel's essence. Our lives are generally prosaic, not epic. Our stories do not end tidily in fifty minute prime-time segments. The narrator speaks to this: &quot;How do you make a book that anyone will read out of lives as quiet as these? Where is the high life, the conspicuous waste, the violence, the kinky sex, the death wish? [...] Where are speed, noise, ugliness, everything that makes us ... recognize ourselves in fiction?&quot; From these quiet lives, Stegner vividly sketches the emotional landscape in which the characters move, making for all its lack of fireworks a surprisingly compelling story. The book has been praised as a wonderful and uplifting portrayal of friendship developed over many years. That might sound a little maudlin or simplistic on the face of it, but it does not come across that way at all. It is difficult to summarize the philosophical tone of the novel. It is at the same time wry, realistic, and sympathetic, generally optimistic about our native toughness and the possibility of grace, and ambivalent about questions of grand purpose. In fact, the story is marked from the beginning with undertones of retrospective melancholy. &quot;[We meant to] leave a mark on the world. Instead the world has left marks on us.&quot; Inaddition to evoking a finely shaded spectrum of emotions, the book is beautifully written. In grade school writing classes we were told to &quot;show, don't tell&quot;, but the author both shows and tells with consummate skill. This book strikes me as being the distillation of a lifetime of experience by an acutely sensitive and intelligent writer and a profoundly decent human being. It feels like Wallace Stegner's carefully considered gift to us, and is well worth giving, in turn.	2001-02-08

You probably know about the Hmong, but in case not, they're mountain tribespeople who fought a shadow war for the CIA in the 70's in Laos, were brought here afterwards, and settled mainly in Merced, CA. They maintain a set of animistic beliefs which most Westerners would dismiss as outlandishly irrational, and the clash between this belief system and the belief system which is implicitly propounded by allopathic Western medicine caused a series of terrible misunderstandings over a span of a few years that culminated in the brain-death of an epileptic Hmong girl. All the dramatis personae in this tragedy, just about everyone involved, was well-meaning and committed. With the very best of intentions, the different _premises_ held by the various parties involved caused events to lurch forward, painfully, towards the grim conclusion. It's a stark reminder of the difficulties that arise when people talk at each other from different frames of reference. These difficulties have hardly been ameliorated by the surface sheen of similarity slapped onto the countries of the world by MTV, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, CNN, Hollywood, etc.  Really thought-provoking -- makes you think about what it means to be open-minded, and what it means to be an American.  As a bonus, the writing is top-notch, and Fadiman is wonderfully sensitive and non-judgmental of both sides.  See Fadiman's other book Ex Libris for more of her excellent writing.  Also, those interested in having their perspectives widened by a story such as 'The Spirit Catches You...' might also consider 'Catfish and Mandala' by Andrew X. Pham, which is the story of the author's long personal road to finding Vietnam, his family, and himself.	2001-02-05

Rights over responsibilities.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the prime example here (see other reviews for details).<BR> Part IV &quot;Releasing Ourselves&quot;<BR> We must have law that allows thinking.  Modern law wants to legislate away uncertainty with ever-thicker rulebooks, but uncertainty, risk, is exactly what drives various parties to work together, in the real world.  Don't fear gov't authority.  Don't think in extremes.  Bureaucracy is the enemy of real democracy.  Legislation cannot save us from ourselves.  In the end, we must rely, as always, on common sense.<br /> Note: rating lost a star because author kept using one example (Glen-Gery Brick Company) again and again, when fresh examples would have been more compelling.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the last section, on what we as citizens can concretely do to help change the situation, was vague and thin. <br /> If this book interests you, you might also be interested in the political writings of Noam Chomsky.  He has written an enormous, readable, extremely well-researched corpus of work that concerned, open-minded citizens can use to consider for themselves where they stand on various issues.  If we were to hazard a label, Chomsky would be a &quot;libertarian socialist&quot;.  Try &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot;... you might not look at your morning paper quite the same way.	2001-02-04

I did think the writing style was a little uninspired. Pham deploys a technique of coining noun-verbs which I found distracting after a while. But that's just surface style... the book stirred a lot of murky submerged feelings in me. Being half-Asian myself, there are natural parallels. Like Pham, I have thought frequently about the nature of identity here in &quot;these United States&quot;.  Beyond that, it is an intriguing glimpse of a country and people about which the typical reader in the US probably has, like me, many misconceptions.<br />Along with 'Catfish and Mandala', you might also consider Anne Fadiman's 'The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down', which chronicles the collision of Hmong culture and Western medicine as embodied by the doctors of the county hospital in Merced, CA. The Hmong were mountain tribesmen who were used by the CIA to fight a shadow war in Laos, and many subsequently wound up here. The analogy to the Viet-kieu is obvious -- that book too has a good chance of significantly expanding your consciousness of (Asian-)American cultural issues, and the writing, organization, and research are first-rate.	2001-02-04

No need to repeat those here.<br />You can probably read elsewhere too about how the characters are wonderfully well-drawn, that the structure, from the plot down to individual sentences, is consistently well-executed, about how wry and warm and extremely observant and funny John Irving is as he writes in his way -- and it is his way in more than just style, this book being an autobiography of sorts -- about the comedy of the human condition.  <br />If I were to stab at a summary -- a difficult task, as one reviewer said, &quot;[the book] defies synopsis&quot; -- I'd say that the book is about being a writer, about being the real thing.<br />So here are a few excerpts from this synopsis-defying book, to try to capture its gist:<br />From the 'Meditations' of Marcus Aurelius:<BR> &quot;In the life of a man his time is but a moment, his being in incessant flux, his sense a dim rushlight, this body a prey of worms, his soul an unquiet eddy, his fortune dark, his fame doubtful.

As a pastiche of American life, this format is interesting and pretty effective.  However, if your main interest in reading the book is to find out about innovative programs around the US, presumably with an eye toward participating yourself, is a bit difficult to get a coherent view of what's happening in each section.  For instance, I would have preferred to have a bit more detail about how each of the organizations was started, what problems were overcome early on and which were still being faced -- there wasn't much pragmatic detail, there were a lot of impressions.  There wasn't even contact information for the organizations in the book.  The overall impression was more coffee-table book than a practical  manual for change.  <br />Here are synopses of the 12 organizations described in the book.<br />1) Doula Service, Univ. Hospital, in Stony Brook, NY. <BR> 'Doula' is a Greek word meaning servant, and today it means someone who offers emotional and practical support at the pre-natal, labor, postpartum stages.  Talks about how doulas engage in this &quot;ancient, humanizing approach to supporting birth&quot;. <BR> <BR>2) Dine bi' iina', Inc., in the Navajo Nation &quot;Dine bi' iina'&quot; means &quot;Navajo lifeways&quot;.  It's a group of Navajo herders, weavers, and cultural activists, working to find ways to prosper while maintaining traditional ways of life.  The titl machine that e of this section is &quot;A Traditional Future&quot;. <BR> <BR>3) Eau Claire Community of Shalom, in Eau Claire-North Columbia, SC<BR> The Community of Shalom is a nat'l initiative of the United Methodist Church.  It encouraged two churches in Eau Claire, one historically black, the other historically white, to work with each other and with other churches &amp; community institutions to improve health care, education, housing, safety. <BR> <BR>4) Proyecto Azteca, in San Juan, TX.<BR> Founded by the United Farm Workers union, this organization (&quot;Project Aztec&quot; -- Aztec being both the name of the ancient people and a relevant acronym in Spanish) helps Mexican-American families escape from colonias and build homes.  A &quot;colonia&quot; is an unincorporated rural development, usually without even basic utilities. <BR> <BR>5) Southwest Youth Collaborative, in Chicago, IL<BR> Grassroots collaboration of churches, social service centers, rec centers, and neighborhood organizations.  Activities include a discussion group for female juvenile offenders, assistance for released offenders, discussion group for youth to understand issues of law/justice, and a variety of neighborhood youth programs.  <BR> <BR>6) Yaak Valley Forest Community, in Yaak Valley, Montana<BR> 150 familes living near Canada, often w/o electricity or plumbing, in the middle of a huge nat'l forest.  The Council, created under the US Forest Service's Forest Stewardship program, supports forest protection, especially in the remaining roadless areas.

Coupled with being gay, that is, with the stereotypical connotations of La Cage Aux Folles-style flamboyance, the lurid title &quot;Naked&quot; might come across at first blush as embodying the book's scandalously funny contents.  To me, however, the book's title seems to be referring more to the state of Sedaris's soul while writing these pieces.  While I did find myself laughing giddily in many places at Sedaris's humorous observations and turns of phrase, the overall impression I had was of a brooding heart, painfully aware of life's absurdity and its own failings.  Sedaris seems to have been born too conscious, in every sense.  <br />So along with appreciating the comedy, I would suggest peering through the humorous haze of absurd scenarios and make out the subtle background hues, to see the real man struggling to find himself.  <br />Read as a book of funny tales, the book gets 4 stars, because the biting humor and silliness wore a bit thin toward the middle.  Read as a straightforward memoir, the book gets 4 stars, because I got the sense that even in baring himself, Sedaris is still hiding some essential self-stuff.  He admits himself that he can't help being tongue-in-cheek about everything; the coating of goofy absurdity pasted on most things in the book is even a little too polished and slick.  While admiring its sheen I felt I kept sliding upon it, away from the 'real' Sedaris.  <br />But maybe that's exactly the point. Read as an impressionist sketch of the author's philosophy and state of mind, it is probably all the more real for its masks and self-consciousness and diversions.  <br />In any case, whether you are by nature attracted to the grinning or frowning mask, you'll find something here for you.	2001-01-23

He shows the reader a wide range of human behavior under extreme duress, including examples of the best and worst in our nature.  It is hard to imagine anyone reading this first part, his condensed description of surviving the death camps, without being moved, without becoming deeply thoughtful, even stunned, in the face of man's inhumanity to man, and conversely of what it can mean to be truly human.  <br />The book continues with Frankl describing his philosophy of psychiatric treatment, &quot;logotherapy&quot;, that is, therapy based on discovering meaning in one's life.  Based in large part on his observations in the camps, Frankl developed a method of treating depression which rejected the Freudian approach of dwelling on the past, wallowing in childhood traumas, in favor of focusing on the future, discovering personal meaning in one's present context.  The idea of proper context is important here. Frankl enjoins against the notion of a One True Meaning of Life.  The analogy he uses is that of asking the chess grand master, &quot;What is the best move in the world?&quot;  It's an absurd question as it stands, of course, as every move must be evaluated in light of a particular game, the current layout of pieces, the personalities and strategies of each player, etc.  Similarly, the constellation of meanings that lend our lives substance and power can very well change over time.  The content of the answer is not as important as asking the right question: &quot;For me, in this place, at this time, what gives or can give my existence the most meaning?&quot; [that's a paraphrase, not a quote]  Acting always in accordance with the honest answer to this question is, in Frankl's view, the most sustainable route to happiness throughout our lives.	2001-01-08

In much the same way that the financial decisions of real people, taken individually, are much more complicated and unpredictable than the simple-minded 'homo economicus' which basic economics  requires for its explanations, the workplace behavior of real people is much more complex than typical management theories are able to capture.  <br />Parent-child and boss-employee relationships are hardly analogous, but a parallel can be usefully drawn between management training and parenting manuals.   No one expects to become a good parent just by reading a book.  Similarly, the many aspects of working together successfully in an organizational context are too subtle to effectively systematize.   So this book's intent is to describe, not prescribe.   <br />I did not give the book a fifth star because some of the illustrative examples were uninspired:  the tired old &quot;lower the truck by letting air out of the tires&quot; anecdote as an example of seeing things from a different angle, the popularity of both fast food and gourmet cookbooks as an example of coexistence of opposites, and a few others.  Also some of the observations seemed trite, e.g., &quot;nothing is as invisible as the obvious&quot; and &quot;every great strength is a great weakness&quot;.   Having said that though, I did find most of the observations to be genuinely thought-provoking.  They are listed below in chapter order.<br />1. the opposite of a profound truth is also true<BR> 2. nothing is as invisible as the obvious<BR> 3. the more important a relationship, the less skill matters<BR> 4. once you find a management technique that works, give it up<BR> 5. effective managers are not in control<BR> 6. most problems that people have are not problems<BR> 7. technology creates the opposite of its intended purpose<BR> 8. we think we invent technology, but technology also invents us<BR> 9. the more we communicate, the less we communicate<BR> 10. in communication, form is more important than content<BR> 11. listening is more difficult than talking<BR> 12. praising people does not motivate them<BR> 13. every act is a political act<BR> 14. the best resource for solving any problem is the person or group that presents the problem<BR> 15 organizations that need help most will benefit from it least<BR> 16. individuals are almost indestructible, but organizations are very fragile<BR> 17. the better things are, the worse they feel<BR> 18. we think we want creativity or change, but we really don't<BR> 19. we want for ourselves not what we are missing, but more of what we already have<BR> 20. big changes are easier to make than small ones<BR> 21. we learn not from our failures but from our successes -- and the failures of others<BR> 22. everything we try works, and nothing works<BR> 23. planning is an ineffective way to bring change<BR> 24. organizations change most by surviving calamities<BR> 25. people we think need changing are pretty good the way they are<BR> 26. every great strength is a great weakness<BR> 27. morale is unrelated to productivity<BR> 28. there are no leaders, there is only leadership<BR> 29. the more experienced the managers, the more they trust simple intuition<BR> 30. leaders cannot be trained, but they can be educated<BR> 31. in management, to be a professional, one must be an amateur<BR> 32. lost causes are the only ones worth fighting for<BR> 33. my advice is don't take my advice<BR>	2000-12-24
