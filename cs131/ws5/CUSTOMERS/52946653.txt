I can't say I *enjoyed* reading this book all that much, but it did make me want to hunt down books on mountaineering by Leslie Stephen and Edward Whymper, among others.  Fleming approaches his subject--the popularization of the Alps--not from a mountaineering or literary or scientific point of view, but rather from a social one.  He is very much concerned about whether so and so was a snob or a gentleman, and that's fine, but prospective readers should be aware.  I would much prefer a more technical discussion of climbing, but Ferguson doesn't seem all that well-suited for this.  Having bashed this book pretty well, I have to admit I learned from it and am glad I read it.  It beats reading Bill O'Reilly or being poked in the eye with a sharp stick.	2003-12-22

As Yeats wrote, \\"The best [those who want to let Hillary, who is a very smart, compassionate woman, have her say in her own words] lack all conviction, while the worst [the Bushies, Fox, Rush, Gingrich, Clear Channel, et al.] are full of a passionate intensity.\\"  Don't let some racist, money-grubbing, democracy-loathing slimbeball tell you what to think about Hillary; you can think for yourself, right?<br />That said, this is a really good book.  There is a sort of \\"gloss\\" on darn near every politician, Hillary and Bill included, but one is foolish to equate this with sincerity and honesty.  I don't care for that varnish myself, but, well there it is, and I know more than anything the varnish is a public face that very public people (like Hillary, as opposed to the Dark Ones working undercover for R. M. Scaife) have to wear to hold themselves together in the face of an overwhelmingly sensationalist media.  (Why is Fox #1?  B/c it is the best?  No, b/c it is the most sensationalist, the most slimey, the news media most akin to porn.)<br />Well, this book may be seen as an extended layer of varnish--not so much the truth as the best spin (which everyone does, Mr. O'Reilly, you especially) on a very public, closely-watched life.  Narratively it succeeds, though at points reading it is like eating sugarcubes--best done in short spurts.  Would this woman make a good president?  Beats me, but with the economy in a hole, our military tied up in a growing number of no-win situations (Mission Accomplished?  I don't think so!), with nature and our few remaining public wildlands reeling from the unwise, shortsighted choices made by greedy businessmen, with almost all the rest of the world convinced we've lost our minds, and--I could go on--I think Pat Paulsen, dead or alive, would be preferable to the expensive suit that resides in the White House right now.  <br />Go Hillary!	2003-06-25

It is part psychohistory, which is always a perilous operation for a writer.  I am one of those people who actually like Freud, but sometimes Solomon's psychoanalysis irritated me, and I was always glad when he left the couch and went back to more or less solid facts.  There is a huge chapter on the Immortal Beloved that  bored me after a couple of dozen pages, but those particularly interested in this aspect of Beethoven's life are in for a real treat!  I'd like to have seen more discussion of B's politics and social views; Solomon's discussion of these is, overall, pretty thin.    <br />But Solomon's weaknesses (and that is my judgment) do not ouweigh his great strengths.  He has certainly done his homework on B's life, and he is a skilled writer and a patient, tireless researcher.  He knows his Thayer as well, and he isn't above questioning long-held assumptions about this flawed but very great man.  Solomon's discussion of B's music is sufficient for a biography (those who want a lot of details on the music should go elsewhere), and he does a great job of showing how the composer followed the classical models and broke away toward romanticism.  He does well in showing the man's great genuis without ever worshipping him (the way 19th century music lovers did).  No doubt about it, Beethoven was a real crumb in a lot of ways, and Solomon makes this clear.<br />As good as this book is, I wouldn't call it definitive.  I imagine some bright peson coming along some day who has a deep understanding of the Enlightenment, of early romanticism, of music, and of German and Viennese society who will give a truer picture of the man in his full context. It is very difficult to describe music in words, but my imaginary writer will be adept at this as well.  Until this person comes along (and we're talking about a reincarnation of Samuel Johnson or Shakespeare), Solomon will do just fine.	2002-06-13

I can still say that this book has been a substantial element in my development as a movie fan.  And still, I think it does a good job at identifying the gems, both huge and obscure.  But lately (say over the past five years), Maltin &amp; co. have begun to lose it; perhaps their plumb line is off.  I dunno.<br />I'm enough a fan of this book to know that I'm not merely being picky.  It's not me that's changed; it's Maltin and his critics. I mean, Maltin has just got to know that THE FAMILY MAN (which gets a 3 1/2 star rating in the latest ed.--I nearly fainted) is not IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  In fact, it is an artistic disaster composed of cliches and rubbish, an interesting premise, and a (mostly) good cast.  The wonderful CROUCHING TIGER gets 2 1/2 stars?  Amazing! (I think he gives CHARLIE'S ANGELS the same rating, no?)  REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is clearly a full star better than Maltin gives it; UNBREAKABLE is at least a 2 1/2 star movie; THE PATRIOT (another string of cliches) is overrated; SHREK is very close to a full four-star film (LM gives it three); and THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is underrated too.  EYS WIDE SHUT three stars?  Zzzzz.  Meanwhile, a fifty-year old ALL THE KING'S MEN, which is tremendously dated, unrealistic, and kind of boring, maintains a &quot;classic,&quot; 4-star rating. (Rethink, Leonard!)  Oh man, I could go on.  The guy is just starting to get them all wrong.<br />Anyway, all in all, this book just sems to get a bit worse every year.  I'm giving it three stars to balance out the five I gave it a while back.  Leonard: please wake up!  You're beginning to lose me.	2001-08-16

It reads like a fun, well-written novel, the main character of which is a fascinating and charming--but insulting and heroin-shooting--musical genius. This leads to the question: Is everything in this book &quot;true&quot;?  I have no idea, not being an authority on Parker, but, at least for now, I don't care all that much.  Ross Russell does a decent job of painting a portrait of Bird, at least in broad strokes, and the reader gains the sense that the book is more or less true, generally speaking.  Russell did, after all, know Parker (even if he had a not-so-great relationship with him), and much of what is covered in the book is documented elsewhere.  The book does, though, have its share of nitpicking critics.<br />I appreciate Russell's knowledge of Parker's main contributions to jazz.  Given my limited knowledge of Parker, Russell has a good sense of the artist at his prime; he knows, for example, that Parker was at his best in the late forties and around 1950, and he discusses why this and that record (&quot;Koko,&quot; &quot;Lover Man,&quot; etc.) is particualrly important.  Though Russell admires Parker tremendously (he insinuates and says outright that Bird is the greatest practitioner of jazz ever), he isn't afraid to show his ugly sides as a person--his tendency to put on airs, be crude and irresponsible, etc.<br />Above all, Russell gives us a good idea why Parker is (I would say, after Armstrong and Ellington) the greatest figure in jazz of the 20th century.  He brings the reader into the solos themselves, as much as a writer can without splitting hairs.     I recommend this book to anyone even remotely inteserested in jazz, Parker, bebop, or culture of the U.S., mid-20th-century.	2001-03-06

Venables is a fine writer--one of the best in his genre working today.  Having read one too many accounts of the Everest region (and a number of books on the west, K2, region), I appreciate Venables's description of the less-written-about middle Himalaya.  The writer's account of the Panch Chuli climb itself is also fine.<br />Unfortunately, after Venables's accident, there is little left to sustain the narrative.  He simply sits around in his tent with his two partners, discussing food and British lit., waiting for the helicopter to come rescue him.  In reality, I'm glad his rescue was easier than, say, Joe Simpson's was in Peru, but it makes for some rather boring reading.<br />To sum, the book is well worth reading, but expect a let down around two-thirds of the way through.	2001-03-05

Ebert's book is worthwhile, and though she's not for everyone, literate movie fans should  soak up all the Pauline Kael they can, but Maltin's annual book is still,  after all these years, the best place to go for a quick movie review.  Maltin's ratings consistently give an accurate reflection of the quality of  the movies, and the writing is concise, clear, informed, full of trivia,  and often funny (see, for example, his analysis of Scorcese's acting in  AKIRA KUROSAWA'S DREAM or the comments on DONDI).  Most importantly, there  isn't a better bathroom book in the world.<br />Now, Maltin isn't going to  please all of the people all of the time.  I could go on and on about his  petty failings (e.g., he originally gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION 2 1/2  stars, realized the mistake, and lifted it up to a respectable 3 in a later  ed.; he is one of the few major critics to pan TAXI DRIVER; he strangely  neglects some widely-distributed video releases, such as Truffaut's  FAHRENHEIT 451, the great TV movie LONESOME DOVE, and so on) and some major  ones (e.g., his tendency to give too much credit to big money films that  are really pretty lousy, such as Speilberg's 1941, or  his--occasional--complete misunderstanding of certain films, such as the  very funny KINGPIN, which he gives a very low rating, and so on), but about  90% of the time, Maltin and his cowriters come very close to pinning the  tail on the donkey.<br />More often than not, Maltin doesn't play it safe in  his judgments: he is, for example, correct to give the first Indiana Jones  movie 4 stars but only 2 and 2 1/2 to the others.  He is correct in giving  the fine DAWN OF THE DEAD 3 1/2 stars--1/2 star higher than NIGHT OF THE  LIVING DEAD.  And he is correct in giving an Oscar-winning Best  Picture--but ultimately so-so-- film like AMADEUS a mere 2 1/2 stars.  More  than anyone, Maltin has an intuitive yet scholarly sense of what the truly  great films are.  He knows about everyone from  Luis Bunuel to Preston  Sturges to Erroll Morris; if he gives something 4 stars, you know you've  gotta go rent it sometime.<br />Now that I think about it, over the years  Maltin's book has become not only a small but substantial part of my own  development as a thinking person, but also a part of the family lexicon.  When my wife begins to watch a movie on TV she will often ask me,  &quot;Where's your book?&quot; and I'll go find the Maltin for her.  Another example: my son learned the word &quot;man&quot; by looking at the  picture of the bearded Maltin on the cover of his book (which is usually  within easy reach in our living room) and repeating the word over and over.<br />If I found myself exiled to a desert island with a TV and a satellite  dish, I would squeeze this book into my suitcase with my clothes and  underwear.

Not that the writer's more well-known TOUCHING THE VOID is badly written; it isn't, and it remians on my short list of the best mountaineering/adventure books I've read. But in THIS GAME OF GHOSTS  Simpson stretches out more fully, more autobiographically (is that a wrod?)  in an attempt to explain (to himself, to the reader) what it is about  climbing that is so attractive, so essential to his existence.  While he is  honest almost to a fault, Simpson is smart enough to not fall (no pun  intended) into the cliches and pseudo-mystical parrot talk that waters down  an awful lot of mountaineering lit.  For Simpson, there is no short,  definitive answer as to why he is drawn to steep, icy mountain walls.  On  the other hand, the whole book is an answer to this question, which he  poses, dismisses, returns to, and obliquely answers over and over.<br />This  is not just a good mountaineering book; it is a bood book, period.  At  first I thought Simpson was being a bit self-indulgent by detailing his  early life.  (&quot;Who does this guy think he is?&quot; I asked myself.   &quot;This isn't Winston Churchill or even Frank McCourt, but an unknown  Brit who thinks we care about his schoolboy years.&quot;)  But he won me  over through his strong sense of humor and good storytelling. And the whole  thing is full of good stories.  Part of the book's appeal is in the  stupidity of Simpson's climbing mistakes, many of which lead to  life-threatening accidents.  But through all his many incidents, Simpson  proves to be as resilient as a rubber ball.	2000-06-30

It is absolutely essential reading for any Hitchcock fan.  Readers learn a lot about the inside of these movies (many of them great, some good, a few not  so good), but, given the immense talent, skill, and experience of both  interlocutors (Hitch and Truffaut), we also learn much about moviemaking,  period.  If I was somehow forced to own only one movie book, this would be  probably be the one.  (Esp. since several of Maltin's reviews have been  stinking it up in recent editions of his book.)	2000-06-28

Many of us think B. Clinton is, for all his flaws, one of the better presidents of the  20th century (after, say, FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, and Truman).  Others,  including Hitchens, choose to put blinders on and see nothing but evil in  the Clintons.  While this book is more well written than most other  anti-Clinton books (and that's faint praise!), it is clearly the work of a  man who has it in for the prez.  Sure, Clinton has, like most politicians,  lied, but I don't think people have died as a result; the same cannot be  said for the lies of Reagan, which led to the deaths of thousands of  Central Americans, among others.  While some of Hitchens's criticisms of BC  are valid, I have a sneaking suspicion that he is JEALOUS of Clinton.  Though he has been identified with the left in the past, his smarmy, nasty  sense of indignation--his meanspiritedness--is more a characteristic of the  extreme right.  Hitchens and William Bennett make strange bedfelloes, but  there you go.  If you want to read an anti-Clinton book, you can do much  worse, but why not read, say, Jane Austen instead?	2000-06-27

Wickwire's musings on life, death, religion, marriage, family, and all that stuff seem so sophomoric and flimsy--not to mention hackneyed--that I had trouble not  flinging the thing across the room at various points.  Not to be cruel, but  the writer's views on the afterlife (for example) make Shirley MacLaine  look like Gandhi.  I'm genuinely happy that the writer has become a more  self-realized husband and father and all that, but, frankly, I read a  mountaineer's memoirs for the mountaineering, not for explicit commentary  on personal stuff.       <br />On the other hand, I did enjoy Wickwire's  climbing narratives, at least a little.  Wickwire will always be associated  with K2--and probably vice versa; it is good to have his account of this  important ascent in the first person.  I wish the whole book had been about  K2.  While the title of the book is atrocious, it is the book's narratives  of dangerous situations that keep the reader going (just as it seems to be,  in part, the danger of climbing that keeps the mountaineer going).  This  book will certainly do for a rainy day or a long plane ride (or even a  long, nasty bivouac), but it is nowhere near mountaineering lit. at its  best.  Look to Jon Krakauer or Joe Simpson for that	2000-05-08

And apparently, given  the subject matter of his latest collection, he has the  critique-of-consumerism-via-unlikely-theme-park domain all to himself.   Like Pynchon and Barthelme, Saunders is not a realist, but rather an  absurdist with a biting sense of humor.  There is, as one reviwer notes, a  certain sameness to these stories, but the same could be said about  Melville's novels, Stevens's poems, or Bruckner's symphonies.

Hence, this book has a fairly wide, if not universal, scope.  While his writing is not what I would call distinguished, Hellman  is skilled at cutting corners and providing reasonably accurate portraits  of these feuding scientists and thinkers, as well as neat summaries of  their hypotheses (and world views, biases, nasty streaks, and the like).  This is easy reading; any reasonably intelligent 16-year old will get  through the book with no problem, and they'll be better off, more informed,  for having done so.  So while this book may not be an important source for  someone writing a paper for a physics dissertation, it will be helpful for  anyone wanting a little more than an encyclopedia entry on why, say, Newton  or Darwin, is important.  Hellman wisely includes notes and a helpful  bibliography for those who want more.	2000-04-24

To be clear, no one is perfect, including Clinton or Franken  or even me, but this book is one of the very few mainstream sources that  comes even close to expressing my own views on Clinton, Gingrich, Limbaugh  et al.  (Trying to find a little truth in the conservative media--i.e.,  CBS, ABC, NBC, NEWSWEEK, TIME, etc.--is like trying to find blood in a  turnip.)  Franken's views are every bit as subjective as those expressed by  Limbaugh or FOX News or other conservative mouthpieces, and this is part of  Franken's point.  But his jokes are funnier, his general viewpoint is  infinitely saner and more humane than Limbaugh's (or O'Reilly's or  Novak's).  Unlike Abrahma Lincoln, the Republicans in the forefront today  have abslutely no idealism, no vision for a better world, and, as Franken  shows so wonderfully in this book, the worst of the bunch are the most  sanctimonious, hypocritical people on the face of the earth.	2000-03-20

The quality of this book is,  I believe, remarkably even, but some pieces hit me harder than others.  No  one could have written &quot;Here's the Ed Sullivan Show&quot; but DB; what  an eye the guy had!  <br />Read this book (or SIXTY STORIES or SNOW WHITE) and  you will not be able to look at the world in the same way again.  DB knew  better than most what petty, unexamined, selfish lives we live (but this is  not to say that DB was mean spirited).  Does he give solutions?  Sort of,  but not solutions that I am capable of paraphrasing.  There may be readers  for whom DB's teachings will seem pointless and not worth the trouble.  (To  them I say, &quot;Back to your Grisham and Steele!&quot;)  But for most of  the rest of us--as bombarded as we are with insulting campaign pitches,  thisandthat.com (!) ads, news of how the market is making us all wealthy,  endless blockbuster film versions of mediocre TV shows, more tripe about  what a great president Reagan was and on and on--DB can function as a sort  of philosophical ophtalmologist with a rare antidote that will both make us  laugh at and feel a bit grim about our consumer society.	2000-02-07

Though the setting is by and large eastern Wyoming of the late nineteenth century, and the subject  matter is cattle ranching, this book will be much more satisfying to  liberal-minded historians and populists than typical cattle ranchers.   Anyone who appreciates or sympathizes with the underdogs in SHANE but would  like a more historically accurate picture of the struggles for land and  cattle in the West might want to give this a look.  It is wholly satisfying  from expository, sociopolitical, and historical standpoints.	2000-02-03

He is a good teacher.  The best thing about this book, though, is the superb quality of the reproductions, all (?) of which are in color.  There are some surprising ommissions (Church's icebergs are nowhere in sight), but this is  a completely subjective complaint.  This book is really a  good bargain.  The binding on the paperback is suspect, but it is nothing a  little book tape won't fix.	2000-02-03

For example, it seemes to me that Wills misunderstands Thoreau's use of irony, and I'm not sure the causal link between Reagan and abortion clinic bombings is as strong as Wills suggests.  But most of the customers who have reviewed this book either 1) haven't  really read all the book or 2) are hopelessly close minded.  <br />That said,  I'll just add that Wills's latest book is a masterful analysis of the very  fiber of American society.  I don't know anyone who LOVES the government,  but Wills shows why it is essential to our well-being, how it is a vital  force in making this great country what it is.  Few people know more about  the Constitution than Wills, but he is not (as some readers suggest) a mere  liberal pedant.  Sometimes the truth hurts.	2000-01-26

It is an injustice that it is out of print.  It's not quite as good as THE DOG OF THE SOUTH,  but it's not all that similar to it either.  Portis is a national treasure  that too few people know about.	1999-11-17

I understand why Langston Hughes has received so much attention over the last several decades--his first-person commentary and description of Black life in the  twentieth century is valuable and enlightening--but Brooks, at her best  (i.e., in this book), is a better poet than Hughes was at his best, and I'm  a little miffed that she hasn't received more credit by the general public  than she has.  It is just that this volume won the Pulizter Prize, and it  will certainly be around for some time.	1999-01-15

While Wills's book is full of biographical info. and is  arranged (more or less) chronologically, it is much more concerned with  tracing the formation of a truly larger-than-life public image.  One of  Wills's purposes is to debunk some of the myths that have clouded the  public's view of (the former) Marion Morrison, but he clearly admires Wayne  as a unique, commanding presence on the screen.  Those who stubbornly  refuse to think of Wayne as anything other than a manly, gun-loving  superpatriot might want to steer clear.  But most thinking people are more  likely to be intrigued, even fascinated.  The author's reading of  Wayne--his life and films (THE BIG TRAIL, STAGECOACH, RED RIVER, and TURE  GRIT in particular)--is always on target and lucid.  While I don't recall  disagreeing with Wills on a single critical point, I occasionally grew  tired of his painstaking analysis of John Ford's background and various  relationships and how they were inserted into his films.  I realize that  Ford played a huge role in the mythologizing of John Wayne, but I--again,  occasionally--found myself asking whether Wills had lost his focus.  Even  so, the Ford sections are interesting; for example, I had no idea that he  was such a sadist and fabricator. Over the course of the book Wills  indicates that Ford was a complicated man, while Wayne was rather simple  (&quot;Wayne couldn't even spell [the word] politics,&quot; Henry Fonda  says in one of the book's quotations).  Though not perfect (I'd give it a 4  1/2 if I could), this is a great, fun book on a great (and overdue)  subject.	1998-09-02

I read this book well over ten years ago, and while it is not fresh on my  mind, I can say with certainty that it's the best rock bio (or, more  accurately, rock group's history) I've ever read. From the formatioin of  the Stones to Brian Jones's death to the horror of Altamont, this book is  completely engrossing and satisfying.  But it isn't merely a biography or a  fan's droolings; Booth has a great sense of sanity among all the insanity,  and he is appreciative and critical at various points.  Booth's persona is,  I think, honest and even amiable.  I consulted amazon.com to try and order  it; while I'm not completely surprised to find that it's out of print, I'm  saddened by the fact.  I wish some publisher would lift it out of oblivion.	1998-08-25

My jury is not all the way in on this (I have to give it four stars to make  room for Greil Marcus' MYSTERY TRAIN and, perhaps, Lester Bangs' PSYCHOTIC  REACTIONS AND CARBURETOR DUNG), but I'm clearly hooked on it for the short  haul.  I'm not sure I've read a book like this before.  There is plenty of  sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll here (especially the latter two), interesting  tales of quirky, sometimes insane, behavior, as well as some strong  arguments for why these people deserve more attention.  It's easy to praise  the merits of, say, the Beatles or the Clash, but Unterberger successfully  engages me in (what is for most of us) musical terra incognito. I've only  heard of about 1/3 of the artists Unterberger covers (I wouldn't say that  Nick Drake, Syd Barrett, and Sandy Denny are exactly &quot;unknowns&quot;),  but he makes me want to try and track down the records of some of these  people (e.g., Skip Spence, Aisha Kandisha's Jarring Effects, etc.).  This  book reminds me--a little--of Nash's BLOOD LETTERS AND BAD MEN (for some  reason--I guess I'm thinking of the Joe Meek piece) as well as Kenneth  Anger's HOLLYWOOD BABYLON (b/c so many of the artists discussed come to bad  ends via alcohol, drugs, insanity, etc.).  The CD (45 minutes long) is  interesting, but my jury is nowhere near decided on IT.  At around $20,  this book is a very good deal.  It's not for everyone, but if you think you  MIGHT be interested in it, you probably will.  Here in a few days I might  kick myself for not giving it five stars.	1998-08-23

He succeeds in giving a sense of what it's like to climb a Himalayan peak sans bottled oxygen, and it is fortunate to have someone who can tell us firsthand about Nanga Parbat's Rupal Face, but the writing (unlike the sheer faces Messner has climbed in record time) is of a low grade.  If there is anyone in the world who needs a detailed biography written on him, it is Messner.  He is indeed the Michael Jordan of climbing; no one is in his league.  But man do I wish some good, talented, informed writer would do a bio on this guy.  No more bios on Lady Di and Donald Trump--please!  Messner is a subject ripe for someone willing and able.	1998-07-08

What apparently strikes other readers as humorous and profound strikes me as strained and tedious.  And yet this is a good read, especially for chidren.  I applaud Rushdie's comments in the book about our great need for storytelling for its own sake; no one, no government, no religion, no commercial interest should have the ability to rob us of this basic human right.  (And no one knows this more intimately than Rushdie.)  HAROUN is not on a par with the other Rushdie book I've read, MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN, but it is generally very entertaining (especially the first and last 50 pages or so).	1998-07-07

This is a consistently interesting history of climbing on the Eiger's North Wall from the late 19th century to the late '70s. I'm not sure I've read a better narrative on mountain climbing, and I can't imagine a better book about the Eiger (though I've never read Harrer's THE WHITE SPIDER). Roth's account is well written, fair minded, vivid, sometimes harrowing, and always informative.  Though I'll probably never have the money to see the Eiger firsthand (and I have neither the nerve nor experience to even think about climbing it), Roth provides us poor armchair alpinists with the best picture of the famous mountain that we can hope for.  It's a shame that the book isn't more readily available. And why is it only in large print?  This makes no sense to me.  The photos are good, especially the ones that indicate the various routes, landmarks, and places where the unfortunates died.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  This is an absolute must for anyone interested in mountains and/or mountaineering, and I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.	1998-07-07

This is the best of Krakauer's three books.  His first &quot;Into&quot; book (INTO THE WILD) suffers from too much conjecture and autobiographical fodder.  EIGER DREAMS reads like a collection of mildly interesting OUTSIDE magazine articles (the piece on K2 is a standout)--which is pretty much what it is.  INTO THIN AIR shows that Krakauer is a fine journalist, as well as an experienced climber.  Above all, he seems fair to his subject(s).  I appreciate his apparent honesty.  There is no badmouthing or fingerpointing here for what happened on Everest in '96--excepting the occasional pokes at himself. His narrative is often riveting.  Closer editing was needed; some phrases and ideas are needlessly needlessly repeated repeated.  I kept waiting for Krakauer to launch into Pittman, who appears to deserve all the criticism she's received for bringing her champagne lifestyle to Everest, but Krakauer shows restraint, which is probably for the best.  Krakauer has to speculate from time to time (something that has apparently caused some grief for family members of victims), but he always (?) qualifies these ideas.  I look forward to JK's upcoming work.  This is a good book, and not a great one.  (Reviewers: Save the 10s for the truly great stuff, for heaven's sake!)	1998-05-29

McPherson is a fine writer who clearly knows his subject, but his balance of thought, his consistent consideration of competing scholarship, and his refusal to simplify matters are perhaps his rarest virtues.  He shows (rightly) that Southern politicians and slaveholders of the day were morally blind, but he doesn't glorify the North as the sacred depository of (what Robert Penn Warren called) &quot;the Treasury of Virtue.&quot;  McPherson's descriptions of the warfare is concise and exciting, and his writing on Lincoln is especially admirable; one comes to see why he is our greatest president.  I also appreciate his inclusion of women and blacks in his narrative.  The Epilogue may be a bit too much of a &quot;cat out of the bag&quot; summing up, and the maps are not as helpful as they could have been, but there is little room for criticism in this great book.  The Pulitzer committee got it right in 1989.	1998-05-29

What makes SOLO FACES such a good read is, in part, 1) Salter's lean, understated, &quot;honest&quot; style, 2) his concern for all his characters, and 3) his ability to write about climbing intelligently without overdoing it.  As far as I know, no novelist but Salter has pulled #3 off successfully.  The novel is based (more or less) on the life of Gary Hemming (Rand in the book), who made a heroic rescue of two German climbers (Italians in the book) who were stranded on the daunting face of the Dru.  Rand is a believable character: humble and shy, but confident and unable (or unwilling) to develop attachments to the various women that shuffle in and out of his life.  I did not love the book's final chapter, which seems too obscure and unsatisfying.  But maybe I just didn't get it.  All in all, this is a very fine novel by one of our most underread writers.	1998-05-29

Keegan skillfully argues his contra-Clausewitz point of view while providing a stunning history of warfare.  He shows us that if one learns something about the history of warfare, one learns something about history--period (and vice versa).  This is sad but true.  I'm not always sure where Keegan's heart is; he sometimes seems to love the smell of napalm in the morning. But at the risk of sounding callous, I think this is a minor criticism.  It is a given (for most of us) that war is a terrible, undesirable, but (Keegan shows) inevitable thing.  Surely Keegan is the greatest living military historian.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.  The book includes some well-chosen, helpful illustrations, and the notes are a great source for further reading.	1998-05-29
