This book is an excellent introduction to the art of reading and writing poems.  The author begins by introducing four basic components of poetry:  sound, imagery, structure, and meaning.  He then devotes a chapter to each of these four elements, using well-chosen examples from poets both famous and not-so-famous.  Readers are encouraged to &quot;talk back&quot; to the poems by writing original poetry that reflects one or more of the techniques--rhyme scheme, structure, imagery, etc.--demonstrated by the examples in the chapter. A sizable glossary is provided for readers who wish further to enhance their understanding of the poetic devices described in the text. The author states that this book is meant to function as a classroom: It is a classroom well worth visiting.	2000-12-05

Beginning with the first confluence of diverse European, Native American, and African cuisines in the New World, she shows how ethnic foods gradually transformed American eating habits even as the food itself was altered to meet the demands of an ever-changing nation; indeed, our sense of what it means to be an American has been inextricably linked over the centuries to our dietary habits and preferences. Along the way, the author reveals the fascinating history of many familiar food products and name brands that played surprisingly large roles in shaping our national identity. This well-written and informative volume provides a fresh and insightful perspective on American history.	2000-12-02

Having often visited Giaometti's Paris studio during the last twelve years of the artist's life, the author is able to provide an intimate portrait of one of the major figures of 20th century art and presents a comprehensive, analytical survey of the artist's work. Included is an extensive interview with Giacometti from 1965 and sixteen of Patricia Matisse's black-and-white photographs of the artist's work and studio. The author explores the artist's interest in the process of objectifying reality, the question of how art is perceived, and how Giacometti's work is related to the work of other modern artists. In so doing, he has written a book that is valuable not only for the study of Giacometti's paintings and sculpture but also for a deeper understanding of modern art as a whole.	2000-12-02

The paintings and sculptures of the so-called &quot;gilded age&quot; reflect these interests as well as the luxurious lifestyle of the wealthy patrons who commissioned family portraits. This beautiful catalogue was produced to accompany a traveling exhibition and presents 52 works of this period by 42 American artists. Each painting and sculpture is reproduced on its own page in full color and faces a succinct but informative discussion of the artist and subject, along with a brief stylistic analysis of the work. The effect is that of a private gallery tour given by an insightful curator.	2000-12-02

In this witty and informative volume, the former executive editor of the American Heritage Dictionary and writer of the &quot;Word Watch&quot; column in The Atlantic Monthly since 1986 generously shares her erudition with those of us who have not devoted our lives to the study of word origins.  Soukhanov looks at 365 words, divided into 13 subject areas (including politics, law, science and technology, sports, advertising media, and food), that have entered our language since the 1980s.  Each section is preceded by an essay exploring how that aspect of the culture has influenced our language. Entries provide detailed descriptions of when and how each word or phrase was first used and discuss its meanings and implications.  The book ends with fascinating analyses of the many ways in which new words come into being, including the formation of compounds, borrowing from other languages, acronyms, euphemisms, and the creative use of prefixes and suffixes.

Complicating his efforts to walk the straight and narrow are his addiction to booze (the &quot;dirty bird&quot;) and the sometimes destructive influence of his friend and musical partner Solly. In describing Man's struggles with both the racist society that attempts to strip him of his dignity and his own inner demons, the author demonstrates his mastery of a rich and poetic prose style that is steeped in the sound and imagery of the blues. This is a fine evocation of African-American life in the American midwest in the middle of the twentieth century.	2000-11-30

The volume is divided into four chronological sections. The first section, &quot;To Be A Jew in the Twentieth Century,&quot; includes the work of poets born around the turn of the century and focuses mainly on such immigrant concerns as assimilation and acculturation. The second section, &quot;New Days for Old, Old Days for New,&quot; contains the work of poets born in the 1920s. Seven of the fifteen poets in this section are women, including the well-known fiction writers Grace Paley and Cynthia Ozick, and redefining the traditional role of women in Judaism recurs as a major theme in many of these poems. The third section, &quot;Struggling to Sing with Angels,&quot; comprises the work of sixteen poets born between 1930 and 1944. Not surprisingly, the Holocaust and the founding of the state of Israel figure more prominently in their work than do some of the issues that most concerned their immigrant parents and grandparents. &quot;A World Above Suffering&quot; features the work of twelve poets born after the Second World War and explores in depth the question what it means to be a Jew in America today. The editor introduces each poet to the reader in a brief essay before the appearance of his or her work, and the entire collection is prefaced by the editor's lengthy and insightful discussion of the nature and significance of American-Jewish poetry. A subject index is included for readers who prefer to read selectively for topics of special interest. Poetry lovers of all ages and ethnic backgrounds will find much to marvel at or simply enjoy in this remarkably diverse assemblage of poetic sensibilities.	2000-11-30

Sure, Corduroy is a warm and fuzzy story about a cute little bear who hops off the toy store shelf in search of a button for his cute little overalls and eventually goes home with the cute little girl who loves him, but that in itself is not enough to make this book the beloved classic that it has become.  What ultimately rings true about this sweetheart of a story is the truth it tells about what each of us, child and grownup alike, wants and needs more than anything else--namely, a home and a friend. Those are the two things Corduroy yearns for, and the author's great accomplishment is to make the reader feel the little bear's joy at the end of the story when he finds both. Every reader, regardless of age or socioeconomic status, knows intuitively that to have a devoted friend and a safe home is truly to find the gold at the end of the rainbow.	1998-03-20

Like Kelly, Watterson wrote and drew in a style that was remarkably sophisticated and subtle despite its deceptive veneer of child-like simplicity; however, while Pogo and his anthropomorphic pals were at their best taking a sharp satirical look at American political concerns of the day, Calvin and Hobbes addressed issues of human nature that transcend considerations of time and place. Calvin and his faithful tiger inhabit an anarchic universe of their own imagining in which nothing is ever easy. Calvin's mind is simultaneously too simple and too complex to cope in a conventional way with everyday reality. In some ways, he's a more innocent incarnation of Bart Simpson; however, unlike Bart, who knows better than to believe a word that the knuckleheaded Homer says, Calvin eagerly embraces and puzzles over every cockamamie story his father tells him. Calvin is a child in child's clothing, which is to say that he's both hopelessly naive and infinitely wise. For all his bravado and grandiose scheming, Calvin is constantly being bested by his parents, his teacher, the babysitter, the school bully, the girl next door, and the stuffed tiger who serves as his alter ego. When Calvin transforms a cardboard box into a duplicating machine, he's even victimized by multiple copies of his own ego-driven self! And yet, however much Calvin suffers, his spirit is never broken--or at least not for long. Knock him down, and he gets right up again with a brand new plan to undermine the forces he can never ultimately defeat. Calvin is the kid in all of us who never wins but never stops fighting the good fight....And besides all that, these strips are funny as all get-out!	1998-03-18

The language of this fine retelling evokes the rich and complex flavor of the original without rendering the story in any way unintelligible to its young audience. I was especially pleased that Drummond chose to keep Ishmael as the first-person narrator of the story; somehow, a third-person retelling would seem at odds with the intimate tone in which Ishmael shared his epic tale with the reader. The bold, colorful illustrations that illuminate this handsome volume serve as an effective enhancement to, rather than a distraction from, the meaning of the text. I suspect that more than one young reader may someday approach Melville's text with enthusiasm and not dread as a consequence of having read or heard this fine picture book in the dimly remembered past.	1998-03-18
