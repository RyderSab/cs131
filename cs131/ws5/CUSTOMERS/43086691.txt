US	43086691	RCED8Q77N96MH	1592799175	325744123	Agents And Adepts	Books	4	2	2	N	N	What a pleasant surprise!	This is a very nice collection of stories, fantasy and SF, that were previously published in small press magazines or books (I'm not familiar with some of the names).  I gave it four stars cause I thought the last story could have been shorter/tighter and one other story, Transfer Student didn't appeal to me.  All of the stories are well written and the author has paid attention to spelling, grammar and editing.   <br /> <br />I borrowed this from the library.  I wish I'd bought it because it's a book with stories that can be re-read-a keeper.  I really liked the fantasy stories and wish they'd been longer, or fleshed out into a book.  That being said, the stories are complete on their own.  I finished this is one day.  It was a pleasure to read stories that caught the attention and kept you wanting more.  I'm now looking for her other book, CRYSTAL THRONE, I hope its as good.   <br /> <br />Story titles are: The Demon's Storeroom, Goodbye Jennie!, Lonely, Transfer Student, And Softly Follow, There Was A Crooked Staff, There Was A Broken Arrow, Bound By A Belt Of Web, Someone Is Watching, Heartsight, Horsefeathers, Curses, Foiled Again, The Windkin, Srike Watch, The Lore-Master's Apprentice and The Twin Bond.   <br />	2005-10-12

I looked forward to this book and was for the most part disappointed.  The Judge Whitney-Cody McCain stories are the best of this bunch, but that being said can't Cody move on to another love interest?  None of the rest did much in the way of holding my interest, making me care or engaging my emotions/imagination.  Three stars are what I give any book that's readable and that I finish.  Why three stars then?  Well mostly because I like a lot of Ed Gorman's short stories and these just didn't appeal to me-you might like them.  And, I did finish the book.	2005-09-01

Her adoptive grandfather had left Claire his entire estate on the condition that she marry one of his grandsons.  But he must have forgotten that the free-spirited Dane Visconti, though long banished from the family's realm, still qualified.  And Claire had always idolized and trusted Dane.  With his worldly reputation, Claire conceded Dane was not the marrying kind, so when he agreed she promised to make no demands on him.  But Dane made no such promise in return-and insisted on a few conditions of his own. <br /> <br />This is a good story, other than the wedding night.  Ms. Graham's usual poor, not beautiful female character and her standard male lead do everything they always do in these stories, but you can go along with the storyline and the lead characters aren't too overbearing.  Copyright for this edition is 1988 and it shows.  Also, no humor in this one.  Sometimes, as with SPANISH GROOM (my favorite) there is a lightness, a laugh.  Not with this story.  But for all those Lynne Graham fans out there, this one is not bad.   <br /> <br />Just a quick note:  one of the reviewers mentioned this book has too much abuse.  Mental, emotional and physical (long hours, no rest) abuse from her adopted family.  Yes, the wedding night was hard (no pun intended) but the book isn't as bad as some others of Ms Graham's I've read.  And after Claire gets sick, Dane's attitude does change.  Also, I didn't find Claire to be a strong personality.  She is the type of female we all have run into that always seems to be a little lost.   <br />	2005-08-09

Back Cover Description:   <br />A Desperate Plea-Ashley had no choice but to plead with Vito di Cavalieri to drop the charges that would put her brother in prison.  She expected Vito to exact a high payment in return.  But what shocked her was his asking price... <br />A Demanding Proposition-He wanted Ashley...in his bed, as his wife.  And passion surged beneath her shaking defenses and betrayed her like never before.  Because how could she control love turned to white-hot hatred-and desire that raged dangerously out of control? <br /> <br />My normal rating for most books is 3 stars.  This got one mainly because I really didn't like the female lead character, Ashley.  Vito was what anyone who reads Lynne Graham expects her heroes to be, but Ashley---irritating, argumentative, selfish, overly dramatic.  She yells, shouts, screams, carries on and is far and away the worst female character Ms. Graham has written.  The book picks up four years after they broke up.  Give this one a miss unless like me you have to read them all! <br />	2005-07-18

She'd fought him to the last, but now she faced a choice:  three months in Carlo's bed, or her father would go to gaol.  Maybe Jessica had been forced to her knees, but she would never give in - because she also remembered Carlo's final vow:  \\"I will never forgive you.\\"   <br /> <br />Typical of L. Graham's stories and not too bad.  This heroine has money, or comes from it anyway.  The hero is Greek and typical Alpha, but not as mean as some of Ms. Graham's men usually are.  Jessica met Carlo while she was engaged, and wouldn't break her engagement to be with Carlo.  Six years later she's a widow and her father is in trouble.  Yes there is another female lusting after Carlo and will Jessica tell him the truth about her marriage?  If you like this author, you'll like this story. <br />	2005-06-14

This is another of Ms. Hamilton's books where you either love it or hate it.  I happen to like it.  I've read it three times and can see some of the other reviewers points of view.  Yes there are typos and other grammar errors.  Yes, she is repeating sentences and there are spelling mistakes.  But none of this takes away from my enjoyment of the story.  <br /> <br />There are complaints about the sex.  Well, for most of this series, I've had to read about non-stop murder, mayhem, guts and gore everywhere, flaying, entrails spilled, and other weird stuff.  So the sex makes a nice change.  It also goes with the type of power Jean-Claude has.  The book takes place over a 2-3 day period.  And it's long.  The beginning is slow, but it picks up about page 80.  New characters are introduced and she has sex with them.  It is one of the ways she gets power.  When Anita starts paying attention to her power needs, maybe having sex with unknown men won't happen.   <br /> <br />There is more talking in this book about relationships.  OK, some of the discussions could have been shorter, but her whining is not as irritating as in the last few books.  I wish her character could just accept what she is and not talk it to death, but I liked this book.  You really have to read some of the earlier books to understand the plot.  This book is not a `stand alone' read.   <br />	2004-10-19

Back Cover description: A Witch, A Warrior And The Wilds Of Scotland...!'Twas like a quest out of legend, Merrick MacAndrew knew, but he would risk anything to save his dying son-even kidnapping Allegra Drummond, whose mystical healing talents ran apace with her power to set his heart ablaze!<BR>What enchantment, this?  A giant of a Highland lord had torn Allegra Drummond from idyllic seclusion to do his bidding!  No matter that his reasons were noble, rousing her compassion and concern.  Merrick MacAndrew had used a life-transforming magic of his own to bind her to him forever-heart, body and soul!<br />I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't work up any enthusiasm for this story.  It takes place in 1559.  Anyone who has read these books knows that this is during the witch burning period.  Not only does this Drummond family all have different gifts, but also people know about them and would kill them if possible.  To top it off, the Drummond women have given shelter to a \\"troll\\" and a \\"hunchbacked crone\\".  Nothing like posting a sign that says Kill Us Now.  The setup in the castle is so, so, -- predictable, that you just want to scream.  The villains are obvious and the book was a struggle to finish.  On page 286, he says he wants to marry her, but tells her he'll often be away fighting and that she'll be alone to handle everything.  My first response was-Right, like she'll be alive when you get back.  The first thing to go wrong; wells drying up, livestock dying-Allegra will be toast.  Try something else	2003-08-13

I really wanted to like this book, but I could just about finish it.  Why?  I expected these men--of the Free Fellows League to be older.  The heroine is in her second season, so I assume she is about 19.  None of these characters worked for me.  They all seemed to be self-involved and only concerned for the now.  He gets wounded and comes back from the war--and whine, whine, depression.  The author could have done so much more with these characters.  <BR>At the start of this book the friends are at school and make this pledge-to form the Free Fellows League complete with rules.  Talk about not growing up--just about the entire last half of the book is about why our hero can't love his wife because of some dumb rules he made up as a teenager.  And also because he \\"isn't good enough for her\\".  I realize that the reader has to take into consideration the timeframe of this book, but enough already.

He decided the simplest way to uncover the truth and protect her was to take her to his bed-and keep her there until he knew her full involvement<br />I did not like Nick.  And Liza should have doormat stamped on her forehead.  My problem with Ms. Baird's books are that I either love them or hate them; and this one is in the hate catagory.  It's difficult to pinpoint why this book annoys me, but Nick is a jerk, and Lisa a wimp.  Since I couldn't like the main characters the story just didn't work for me.	2003-08-08

Surely working private duty in placid Pine Grove would provide peace of mind...<BR>Alas, Amanda's first patient proved impossible-impossibly handsome, impossibly rich and impossibly impatient to recover from his skiing injuries.  Difficult, demanding, yet maddeningly attractive, Sheik Rahman Harun imperiously installed Amanda in his posh ski villa-and seductively insinuated his way into her heart. Yet Rahman was royalty...while all Amanda had to offer was TLC.  When he had recovered, would Rahman leave her with a broken heart or would he take a chance on the love of a lifetime?<br />Not bad.

AMBULANCE SHIP, SECTOR GENERAL, AND STAR HEALER are the three stories in this volume. These are medical s/f stories.  I had been trying to track down the Sector General stories that are out of print, when this was published.  Unfortunately, quite a few of the stories are out of print.  Even the libraries have only a few of the stories.  These are books about people/aliens/things and how we may interact on a medical level. Mr. White offers viewpoints and ideas on inter-species relationships and the stories are always nicely done.  The only drawback (?) is that you shouldn't read all the stories all at once.  I found that if I read something different in between reading each book, the stories read better and had a little more tenseness.	2003-06-28

Megan's mother's dying wish was for Megan to see if the child was OK.  Typical plot, you can see the storyline coming.

Kate's marriage to Michalis Theodakis is in the past-in all but name.  She knows he married her only to cover up his affair with his mistress, so how dare he expect her to play the dutiful wife?  And now Michalis wants to escort her to his sister's wedding!  Kate has no intention of returning to Greece-until Michalis blackmails her.

If they still burn for each other's touch, can their marriage really be a sham?<br />The only problem I had is that Kate never actually says \\"You cheated with Victorine\\" to Mick.

The young boy runs away, she finds him.  The father is looking for him and she immediately dislikes him.  Sarah takes the word of a 6 year old that his dad hates him and goes on from there.  I not surprised Sarah had problems at her teaching job.

Equally disturbing, though, were the new feelings this irascible, demanding, charming man was awakening in her.  Dare she trade the ghost of the past for a living, breathing, achingly desirable man?<br />All the characters are good, and the butler is a hoot.

Her patient gave her no trouble at all-which was more than could be said for her son, the disagreeable Professor Charles Cresswell.  He seemed to have taken a dislike to Judith on sight-a dislike which, it must be confessed, Judith returned with interest.  And now he was turning up to spoil their pleasant holiday in Portugal as well!<br />Fine Betty Neels story.  In this one, Judith is attractive and has a family.  Charles in not a doctor, but a professor.  He does have money though.  Ms. Neels' stories always have that edge to them--someone is sick or dying.  It gives her plots that extra dimension, an edge, that make them so readable.  She might be writing a fairy tale that has a happy ending, but reality is always there.	2003-06-13

Maggie dispensing her favours indiscriminately, and Finn indulging his playboy tendencies.  But then Finn fell genuinely in love--with Laurie, daughter of financier and jeweller Nicholas Fortune--and the house of cards Maggie's scheming had wrought fell about her ears.  <BR>Nick thought Laurie wanted to be friends with Maggie, and was set on wresting her away from this 'scarlet woman'...and Maggie was horrified to realise that her response to Nick was returned in full measure. <br />I wasn't going to read this, I didn't care for the way it seemed as everyone was committing adultery.  However, it is just a paper marriage formed because Maggie and Finn's grandfathers were losing control of their companies.  The author states this in the first chapter.  Good solid story, likable characters.  My only objection is that Nick at times was nasty, and I would have liked the characters to be a little older--Maggie and Finn are 25? but Laurie is 17!!!  A little too young to be married.  Try it, another good one from Ms. Napier.	2003-05-28

I'm leaving my original review intact(see paragraph below)because it makes sense only if you've read the book. My only excuse is that I wrote it right after finishing the book and I'd been up all night.  That being said, my recommendation is that you read all the books in this series first.  All of these books can be read by themselves, but a lot of the storylines and characters stop and start between books.  This book makes more sense and you get a better feel for the story if you do that.  Now, why should you read this story?  Because it's a great read with characters you can care about/hate/love/root for.  This is Dark Fantasy/Erotica/Horror, depends on how you see the story.  Yes, it's about vampires, wereanimals, zombies, and other stuff, but done so well and differently that it is all new.  Try it.<br />Great story, great sex. I'm sorry for Richard, but hey, he had his chance. Some of the other reviewers have stated that the sex is overtaking the storylines, not so. What this is doing is giving us reasons why humans 'go over'. Jean-Claude develops new powers, so does Asher. I really like Micah, he is probably one of the better characters in the whole series. He does what needs to be done, no whining. This book sets up possible storylines; Mother of Darkness, baby vampires, Belle Morte (again-Anita needs to be able to get this broad), Richard's choice for lupa, and more cooperation among the shape shifters. Good, fast, tight read. Here's a question--since Sylvie has lost her challenge, is she still number 2 in the pack and if not, can she become Richard's lupa? I like Sylvie's character and she has what it takes to be tough, without hurting the pack. Also, Asher has a new power so why can't he also get an animal to call--how about Christine (weretiger), she was briefly in NARCISSUS IN CHAINS and another book I can't remember just now. If Ms. Hamilton is waking the Mother of Darkness, Anita is going to need all the help she can get, and Asher needs someone justfor him, no sharing.	2003-04-13

But now Ryan was determined to make Jane pay for his wrecked marriage-by making her his mistress for real!<br />And Ryan took his time (a few years) to grind Jane into the ground.  He finally has his revenge-she's broke and bankrupt.  They have an intense love-hate feeling for one another. The scene where she goes to the hotel room with the older guy to have sex just sets up the relationship with Ryan.  You know he isn't going to let anyone have her but himself.

He believes Sara, his wife, cheated on him with another man, and Lia is the result of that betrayal.<BR>So Sara and Nicolas are separateduntil the silence between them is forcibly broken: Lia has been kidnapped!  Nicolas knows he is the only one who can secure the little girls safe return, but it means he must go back to Saraand find that, even after three long years, she still wears his ring<br />Fast paced and full of tension.  From the opening pages to Nicolas finally finding out the truth this is an intense book.  So why only 3 stars?  I didnt like the father of Nicolas and I wish Sara had gone out on her ownnot sat around for three years in Nicolas house in London.  Did she do it for spite?  A good, strong book, but I felt something was missingeven though I liked it.	2003-03-28

The one place in New Zealand for her to contemplate the drastic changes she was planning in her life.  But Francesca found it already occupied.  Ross Tarrant, an uncomfortable reminder of her naïve adolescent days, was firmly and legitimately ensconced. <BR>She had outgrown the embarrassing memories but had never forgotten him, and found he still left her light-headed and breathless.<BR>Ross saw Francesca as a challenge, the old chemistry between them still strong. Yet beneath the mature, successful façade, he exposed the same insecure, vulnerable girl she's once been.<br />This only got 2 stars cause I didn't like it.  They meet again after years away from home and she jumps to the conclusion he's wasted his talent.  They fight over the cabin, and then she discovers what he does do and is impressed.  Francesca's character needs a sense of humor and Ross needs-something.  Near the end, something else crops up, and on and on.  I've liked most of Ms. Napier's books, but not this one.

Back Cover description:  Clare usually ran a mile from powerful, sensual men like Guido Bartaldi. Only, she'd agreed to live under Guido's roof as companion to his wayward ward, the young woman clearly  destined to become Guido's wife....<br />Horrified at Guido's marriage plans, Clare soon decided to leave-and found herself all but<br />captive in Guido's palatial villa. Then she realized it was she who'd been chosen as Bartaldi's bride.<br />Good sexual tension, plot moves along and all ends well.  I only gave it 3 stars because one: Guido keeps on about marrying his ward while romancing Clare, two:  Clare's character seemed to collapse about half way through the story and three: the ward annoyed me.	2003-03-27

Back Cover description:  If diehard bachelor Tyler Fortune was being forced by his parents to marry, he'd darned well do it on his own terms-even if it meant securing a bride through a dating service!  Mousy Julie Parker seemed the perfect candidate.  In return for becoming his wife, all the shy librarian wanted was a baby.  And Tyler thought marriage wouldn't change his life much at all.  Until his sweet bride had a glamorous makeover and they got down to making a baby the old-fashioned way....<br />This would not happen in real life.  It is an enjoyable story if you can get past the plot.  Both Tyler and Julie grow and learn in this story.  The reason I didn't give it 4 stars is that I hoped Tyler would call his parents bluff and Julie gets a new haircut/clothes and becomes beautiful.	2003-03-26

Back Cover description:  Boston hunk Nicholas Barone could hardly believe one-year-old Molly was his daughter. The sexy businessman was committed only to his extended Italian family, to their businessBaronessa Gelatiand to short-term relationships with gorgeous socialites.  Then one pint sized female turned his priorities upside down. <BR>Enter Gail Fenton, nanny extraordinaire.  Within days she had a cranky Molly smiling; within a few sleepless nights, she had a frustrated Nicholas fantasizing.  Bewitched by a virgin.  Vexed by the girl next door.  Man-about-town Nicholas was in serious trouble, for unlike his former lovers, who wanted only his money or his name, Gail wanted his heart.  <br />Good cast of characters.  The whole family seems likable and this series is going to have 11 more books.  Gail is a good, strong female lead.  Nicholas is sexy, and nice.  He has commitment problems but does realize where his love is.  I just wish the author would have used something other than a car accident to bring them together.	2003-03-26

Back Cover description: Dashing bachelor prince Sharif Asad Al Farid swept onto the Desert Rose ranch, his eyes as fierce as the Texas heat. Although he'd come to meet his newfound relatives, it was their lovely ranch hand who attracted his attention. Olivia Smith's beguiling innocence and sassy attitude enraptured him. Matrimony wasn't on Sharif's mind-until the press caught them in a compromising clinch...and his royal family demanded a wedding. <BR>The powerful sheikh could not deny his duty, but convincing independent Olivia to become his princess bride would put his reputation as a master  of charm and seduction to the ultimate test.<br />This is the fourth book in this series.  I've read HIS INNOCENT TEMPTRESS (I think it was by Kasey Michaels).  This book is similar in that both brothers have to decide which is more important, politics or love.  Olivia is a good, strong, likable heroine.  Sharif's character starts out obnoxious but grows and develops nicely.  There is a little humor, secondary romance and good sexual tension.  The only drawback was that I didn't feel that Olivia could have been as naïve as she was after working with the ranch hands for so many years.	2003-03-26

Though the elderly millionaire is ill, Demetri is certain Joanna isn't what the doctor ordered!<BR>However, Demetri's attempts to dig beneath Joanna's coolly beautiful exterior reveal few clues as to the nature of her relationship with his father.  She's giving nothing away...except an unwitting sexual attractiveness that Demetri finds hard to resist....<br />Well-done story with good sexual tension between Joanna and Demetri.  Two subplots thrown in; one about the father's health, and the other about Joanna' ex-husband.  Joanna seems to have the upper hand-by that I mean she is not a doormat doing whatever Demetri wants.  Her relationship with his father is nicely done and respectful.  Try it.	2003-03-24

And when he offered Joanne a dream promotion, she realized she'd be at his side almost twenty-four hours a day....<br />Working so closely with Hawk, Joanne found it hard to ignore how irresistibly sexy he was.  She was determined not to have and affair with her boss, but what if Hawk wasn't looking for a mistletoe mistress-but a wife?<br />OK, I liked Hawk's character, but I wasn't crazy about Joanne; as much as she stood firm in her convictions she also seemed to whine.  The first couple of chapters were a little hard to take.  She confronts the new boss with info based on gossip, finds out her mistake and resigns (or is going to).  When she gets the new promotion, she doesn't change the secretary?  Bits and pieces worked, but the whole plot came across as fragmented.  Also, she never becomes his mistress--who chooses these titles?	2003-03-22

Can he possibly give her the sense of belonging and love she's always craved?  His proposition is very tempting.  And they do share an intense physical attraction.  But is she truly the bride he wants...or just the easiest path to power!<br />Leigh left her family years ago so she could get on with her life away from her father and family.  Richard is an interesting hero and really does care for her-enough to have let her go and grow.  There is the usual twists, but three stars is all I could give this story.

Especially with the glamorous Fiona as direct competition.  And yet Lucy knew there had to be some way of making William notice her....<br />One of the better books by this author.  William is a doctor, and Lucy is working at an orphanage.  She lives home with parents and sisters and unlike a lot of Ms. Neels' heroines, doesn't need the income.  The plot moves along, William is one of the nicer heroes this author has written and the ending is very good. Try it.	2003-03-21

Though is broke Daisy's heart to hand over control of her family's horse farm to him, she had no alternative-she was in Dante's debt up to her ears!<br />Part of the deal included Daisy relocating to Dante's ranch in Argentina.  Daisy knew she was far too ordinary to ever become the count's wife.  But could she resist Dante's demands that she repay her dues in his bed?<br />Dante's character is OK, but I really didn't care for Daisy's.  This is one of those female leads that rub you the wrong way just about every time she opens her mouth.  Daisy's family owes a lot of money to Dante.  I don't recall him demanding she repay him in bed, they just wind up there.  She has a problem with her dad; Dante has a problem with his sister.  This is the first Jane Porter book I've read.

If only Marius would ride up on a white horse and ask for her hand in marriage.  But people lived happily ever after only in fairy tales, didn't they?<br />Typical but nicely done.

Having taken the trouble to track her down while she was enjoying an occasional holiday in Holland, he seemed to have other plans for her.  But was she really willing to let him take over her life and possibly her heart?<br />This was her first holiday, she has known Litrik since she was a student nurse and she knew her life wasn't complete, but was caught by her aunts. This is not an easy book; Litrik has a dying child he wants Francesca to care for.  Also, Ms. Neels makes the story so that one-minute you dislike Litrik, the next you don't, and so forth.  It's as though she can't make up her mind.  If it wasn't for how Litrik's character was unsettling; especially after the death of his daughter, I would have given this plot four stars	2003-03-17

She remembered his gentleness toward her as a young girl, but now she suspected Tareq's scheme was a calculated means of getting closer to the beautiful woman she had become-with no promise of commitment on his part.<BR>Tareq claimed to have lost the capacity to love and he was so totally self-contained, so frustratingly untouchable that Sarah surprised herself by wanting to find out how he would react if she turned the tables-and set about seducing him!<br />Not a book I really liked.  And Tareq doesn't make the first move, Sarah does.  She offers herself, sort of, and Tareq takes her up on it.  Sarah's character doesn't do much other than react and Tareq is an iceman.

His power and wealth bought him most things-except a mother for his young son.  Slade wanted Daisy.  Her sweetness would make her the perfect nanny for  little Francesco; her sultry innocence would make her the perfect mistress for himself!<br />He hits her with his car, offers her a job and falls in love with her. Slade doesn't offer her a mistress position, but a job as a nanny. Not an easy story to read.  Very little sex when all is finished and Daisy has a lot of emotional baggage she's dragging around; dead child, failed marriage. Slade's character is one of the better alpha males in a while.

Good sexual tension between Dane and Suzanne, but he leaves her in the dark too long as to what his feelings really are.  Suzanne has let herself go do to grief, and she is not plain as the other reviewer mentioned, just depressed. Read MERGER BY MATRIMONY by this author also.	2003-03-03

Meeting Dr. Roele van Dyke was a blessing for Emma Dawson.  He always seemed to go out of his way to make her happy, and she couldnt imagine life without him.<BR>And when the time came for Roele to return to Amsterdam permanently, he knew he couldnt leave Emma behind.  So he offered her a job at his surgery.  Emma was in love and simply couldnt refuse.  But did Roele want Emma to be his secretary or his wife?<br />A nice, pleasant Betty Neels story.  Emma is not a nurse; she is taking care of her whiny, selfish mother.  The mother is almost too much to take, but thankfully she is gone by the halfway point. Emma has no skills, so it is not easy for her to get jobs she can make money at.   Roele is in love with her by page 72.

Back Cover description: Beth was left breathless when gorgeous Italian tycoon Dex Giordanni proposed marriage--within days of meeting her!  But then she overheard a conversation that chilled her: Dex wanted to wed her to settle a family score. <BR>Beth prepared herself to end their engagement-how could she have been so naive as to think Dex was really interested in a virgin like her?  But Dex didn't take no for an answer.  If a diamond ring couldn't seduce her to the alter, then he would!<br />Typical plot, with some tension, and characters you wish would talk to one another, but if they did-where would the story go.  This one moves along, the sexual tension is OK and Dex finally stops acting like a jerk. At one point I found myself saying--write Dex a note Beth, tell him who Paul is.  That issue went on too long.  Not as good as RAUL'S REVENGE by this author, but better than THE RELUCTANT FIANCEE & A DEVIOUS DESIRE.	2003-02-27

Before she can protest, Leon has whisked her away to his luxury villa in Cyprus.  And guess what: that same mutual, intense physical attraction is as strong as ever.  Bea might be unwilling to be Leon's fiancee a second time, but it's proving harder to steer clear of his bed!<br />What is it about these plots that involve adult men lusting/loving after women in their late teens?

She had to keep working for Alex's mother and therefore face the force of Alex's attraction to her head-on, but an idea was starting to form!<BR>Their sheer physical desire was the one weapon Saffron had against Alex.  If she could push him so near the edge that he would agree to marry her...she could at last have sweet revenge!<br />I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 for the first two-thirds of the book.  Just before and after the marriage the book lost my interest. Saffron realizes what she is doing is wrong, but does it anyway?  And Alex doesn't walk out- he makes a bargain?

The misunderstandings of the past few weeks had left their mark and now Raul had got his revenge; he seemed to think Penny was nothing but a gold-digging tramp. <BR>But of all the gifts Raul had given Penny, none could match the one she took with her when she walked away from their relationship.  Unbeknownst to Raul, she was carrying his child!<br />This book got three stars because I really didn't like the beginning to the story, I almost didn't finish it.  There was something about the first part of the plot that made Penny seem cheap. And the part about the bracelet was strange, I was glad she left it behind her.  When the author moves the story past where Penny walks out, the whole plot gets better.  Raul's character gets some depth and you find out what the bracelet means.  Try it.	2003-02-24

Attractions: the Acropolis, the Islands-and Alexis Theodorou.  Zoe had been told that Greek men's attitudes could be rather traditional, but Alexis Theodorou's ideas were positively archaic.  Especially when it came to Sofia, his younger sister.  As Sofia's companion, Zoe couldn't help but be appalled by Alexis's possessiveness.  As a woman, she couldn't help but be intrigued....<br />I agree with the reviewer from Hong Kong. Zoe made some really dumb choices and in this HIV world to have unprotected sex is just suicidal, and that goes for Alexis too. This book got two stars because Alexis was just short of the date rape type.  I know these books are supposed to be about the strong overbearing male and vulnerable female, but this just didn't feel right.  The book has a 1992 copyright, so the sister can't be that sheltered or unaware of what's going on in the world.  I gave this book two stars because of the descriptions of Greece.

Gina Bennett, victim of a freak accident, had suffered plenty.  She wasn't about to let her publisher, Leo Sterne, open old wounds--especially the memory of her disastrous first infatuation.  It was bad enough that Leo thought she'd ruined his sister's marriage....Now he wanted much more than an admission of her guilt.  He needed her to help his deaf young son.  And against his will, he wanted her. All Gina wanted was to forget--forget the past, her loneliness and her need for love.  But Leo and the boy made that impossible. <br />Gina had an accident at 16; she lost the use of her voice.  She finally has it back, and runs into Leo on his island.  Leo is dragging his own emotional baggage around and to top it off he finally gets custody of his son.  Lots of different plot threads here and an unusual storyline.  Fans of Ms. Napier should give this a try.	2003-02-23

After years spent nursing her grandfather, she was going to live for herself-take sunrise breakfast rides, learn how to rope, have adventures and watch the desert stars.  Only she got picked up by the wrong cowboy at the train station.  Instead of vacationing on a dude ranch, she found herself taking care of Stuart Anderson's house and his daughter.  Maddy was a sucker for a strong and silent man in denim and dusty boots, and she was an even bigger sucker for being needed.  Stuart and his daughter obviously needed a woman.  And how they needed her love. But hadn't she headed West for freedom?<br />I agree with the reviewer from IL in that it could have been better, but for an easy, quick read it's OK.  Nice bunch of <BR>characters.  Both Stuart and Maddy are likable, the daughter is not annoying and all ends well.  Great book cover--is it a photo or painting?	2003-02-23

Polite, professional-except for an accidental, intensely passionate one-night stand that should have never have happened!  Both have tried to put it behind them-or so Kalera thought.  But Duncan is haunted by their one reckless night together, and he's furious when Kalera announces her engagement to another man.  Whatever it takes, Duncan intends to entice Kalera back into his bed, and his life-permanently!<br />First-this plot description is slightly off; I'd like to know who writes these.  Kalera had just lost her husband and Duncan, as a friend of the family was staying with her to help her-distraught with grief she winds up in bed with him.  Duncan has been in love with Kalera for years and hasn't ever touched her till then.  He is trying to give her the time she needs to heal and finds out she has been seeing another man. She tries to forget their one night by playing it safe/comfortable with someone else.  I gave this 3 stars because I liked the characters but I felt the conflict dragged on too long.

Back Cover description:  She could read between the lines, and Caroline Sommerfield knew at a glance that business mogul Stephen Monterey had written off any prospect of joy for himself.  But working for this very private man convinced her that her true talent was a gift for living, one she was more than willing to share...with Stephen!<BR>Given the choice, Stephen Monterey would prefer to remain tied to his desk, hard at work, rather than spend his time with frivolous amusements.  But that was before Caroline Sommerfield danced her way into his ordered existence, creating her own special chaos and determined to rewrite the story of his life...!<br />Pleasant main characters, nice sub-plot with secondary characters, good build up of sexual tension and a minor mystery about the missing sister-in-law. Caroline is a handwriting expert in 1896 California.  If you can go with that premise, the rest of the book works.  The most irritating character is the aunt.  It detracts from the story.  I almost didn't bother to finish this book because of this character. However, about halfway through the author mutes this irritant and the book moves on.	2003-02-22

Back Cover description: Victoria struggled to suppress her fantasies about Lucas-after all, the man she had married lay dying in a hospital bed.  But Lucas Grey had an exciting sexiness, an intriguing combination of cynicism and languid sensuality that simply held Victoria spellbound. <BR>Her marriage was passionless, but tender and loyal.  Victoria clung devotedly to her husband, as much to protect herself from the strength of her desire for Lucas as to preserve her marriage.<BR>But Victoria feared there would come a day when she could no longer deny the feelings Lucas awakened in her-when she would have to admit that she'd fallen in love with another man!<br />I almost didn't read this because of the plot description.  I don't like books where the spouses cheat.  This book is not like that.  Victoria's husband has been in a coma (no brain function) for three years.  She is the second wife and is taking care of five stepchildren.  Lucas doesn't know she still has a husband and Victoria doesn't say anything because one of the stepchildren has problems with the situation.  It's more involving and better than it sounds.

What he really needed was a lesson in flirtationand, on impulse, Roz decided to be his teacher!  Luke was a fast learner.  In fact, Roz soon discovered that he didnt need lessons at all.

Still, there was unfinished business between them: a reckless one-night stand just two months ago...Regan did have a hidden reason for getting close to Joshua's family.  Only she could never reveal her secret plans-not even when Joshua confessed his engagement was a sham and he wanted his ring on Regan's finger!  <br />The first 96 pages and the ending are worth four stars.  The rest of the book is fine too.  The only quibble I have is that Joshua spent way too much time engaged to the wrong woman.  The plot description above is wrong in that she doesn't know whose wedding she is organizing until she gets to meet the groom to be.  There is a sub-plot about the brother that goes on too long and I wonder if Ms. Napier ever wrote a book about Joshua's son?	2003-02-14

The only verdict Jessica could be certain of was that she was now expecting her boss's baby!<br />Nothing new, but likable characters in a plot that's been done before.  Jessica is a lawyer and not all that young, so why did she rely on the rhythm method for birth control.  And why did Bruno?  You get the feeling that he set the whole trip up, so why no condoms?

There was no escape from his watchful presence.  Tension was growing and it was only a matter of time before suspicion turned to attraction...and Antonio changed from enemy to lover!<br />Antonio's character is typical alpha male.

This is better than ON A WILD NIGHT & ON A WICKED DAWN.  I really disliked those two books.  DEVIL'S BRIDE was the best in this series.  About this book: it was OK till about a third of the way through; then it seemed to lose its direction.  There are just so many pages of sex that can take the place of character and plot development.  All the two main characters did was talk about their control issues.  They are not willing to risk their heart/soul to another--and the secondary characters were cardboard figures, this book could have been so much more.  Simon is part of a group of males who mate for love, and are happy. Yet he seems not to want to risk anything to attain this.  It's as if he is afraid of being happy and fulfilled. To be honest, I've never understood the theme that runs through these books about these strong, true men being afraid to love and equating that with the loss of control.  Ms. Laurens has beat this idea to death for this series, and it's boring. Simon and Portia have pages of discussion with themselves about what they are feeling and should they/will they connect with each other and if they do can they keep something of themselves back--who cares!  You can see the minor mystery coming from a mile away, and the villain is easy to spot.  The promise is there but the book is disappointing.  Read WORTH ANY PRICE by Lisa Kleypas instead or re-read DEVIL'S BRIDE.  At the end of this book is an intro for a new series Ms. Laurens is doing that takes place in the year following Waterloo (1815) with what looks to be 7 men.  Let's hope it will be different and more plot driven.  Ms. Laurens--sex in romance books is always great, but it should go hand in hand with a good plot, not instead of it.	2003-02-10

Especially as Curtis had returned to his family home to find Jade already in residence...Curtis was determined to protect his brother and control Jade--by pretending to be engaged to her himself!  Jade was given no chance to protest, and she was stunned by the scandal that followed--and by the very real, passionate charge of attraction she felt toward her new \\"fiance\\"!<br />Right, Curtis has some control issues here.  The brother comes off as somewhat spineless and Jade could use some backbone.  But I guess when two of the characters are going through therapy, you take what you can get.  It's not as bad as it sounds, the story moves; you get involved with the characters but you just wish Jade's character were stronger.	2003-01-27

Realizing he's gone too far, Scoot offers Anya temporary employment at his home.  But having her around every day is playing havoc with his self-control.  Soon all he can think about is making Anya a proposition-that she share his bed, night after night, to their mutual satisfaction...<BR>I have to disagree with the reader from Omaha, NE. The first few pages of this book were OK. They seemed to set up a good, strong heroine.  It went downhill fast.  She is a teacher/chaperone at a camp.  She leaves all the sleeping teenagers to go off to get two that snuck out to a party.  The first thing she should have done was get help. She gets to the party, sees everyone is drinking/doing pot/sex(?) and doesn't  call the police.  I don't know what the age of consent/drinking is in New Zealand, but someone had to be breaking the law.  And the author manages to get Anya out of her clothes while she is confronting a drunken male senior.  Enough already. Read RECKLESS CONDUCT instead of this.

After living all her life in the jungle of Panama, Destiny is on her way to London to claim her inheritance-a business worth millions!  Flung into a city jungle, Destiny feels lost, self-conscious and out of her depth in the world of international business.  Especially as her company has a predator-handsome, ruthless tycoon Callum Ross.  He's determined to own her company; she won't sell.  So he has a proposal for her-merger by matrimony!<br />This is my first book by Cathy Williams and I plan to get any others she has written.  The book has a great female lead and a very likable and vulnerable male lead.  The plot description doesn't do justice to the story.  Destiny is a woman who is not so much `lost' as in unfamiliar territory.  And it's not that she won't sell, but that she is making sure that it is the best way to go.  Nice interplay/dialogue between the main characters, and the secondary characters are interesting too.	2003-01-26

Ruth had been overwhelmed by Franco Leoni from the moment she became his secretary.  A shy reverend's daughter, Ruth was stunned when such a dynamic, handsome man took an interest in her.  She knew she shouldn't, but she couldn't help falling in love with her boss!  Franco didn't want a secret affair, but Ruth was afraid of scandal.  She tried to disguise her feelings and conceal their passion.  Only, there was one thing she couldn't hide: she was expecting his baby!<br />This is my second Ms. Williams story.  I liked MERGER BY MATRIMONY better, but this wasn't bad.  Yes, as the other reviewer states it does seem to waver, but it's not bad.  I think I was expecting a stronger heroine, but I like the way this author makes the hero vulnerable.  And Ruth's parents can't be that unaware/innocent of what is going on.	2003-01-26

There was no room in her life for marriage--but now the father of her unborn child had arrived on her doorstep! Jennifer's first problem was that her entire family believed Raphael Jordan was actually her husband--and that, at last, the happy couple could have a honeymoon! Her second was that Raphael was delighted to oblige...so Jennifer was forced to share a bed with her gorgeous, sexy, pretend husband! <BR>I liked this book. The story was unusual and interesting. She was tricked. Jennifer got married because she thought she was helping a dying man, and in return he would help her have a baby by invitro. She was set up. Her husband used his son's sperm to get a grandchild. The son thought he had been setup. Good interplay between the characters and the plot moves along nicely	2003-01-25

Strong and likable hero(Marcus), but at times I had to wonder about the heroine (Harriet).  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I realize she strongly needed to change her life/image but trying to have serial/promiscuous sex just didn't ring true. It's not as bad as it sounds, cause she never really gets to do it, but it just didn't mesh with her character.  Interesting and hot read.  Try it.	2003-01-25

Kate Crosby was determined to be independent.  Her dreams were of owning her own catering business, not of marriage and babies!  For now, she was happy enough putting her skills into practice as a housekeeper.  She certainly wasn't looking for a husband...Until Mr. James Tait-Bouverie came to visit.  He was irresistibly charming and firmly believed that love couldn't wait!  James challenged all Kate's plans for the future.  He challenged her to love him, to marry him.  What if Kate said yes?<br />Ok, who writes these plot descriptions?  As a long time reader of Ms. Neels, I almost didn't read this book because of this description.  Don't worry, this book is like all the rest,  Kate is stuck in a nasty job (she is not happy) and instead of dragging animals around, in this book it's her mother.  And James is like all the rest of Ms. Neels' heroes, silent and not saying much about marriage to the heroine.  Enjoy	2003-01-24

Outside the office, Callan Sinclair didn't know that Abigail Thomas existed. But Abigail had definitely noticed the broad shoulders and intense brown eyes of her employer.  His powerful presence had taken her breath away more than once-and the fantasy of his kisses kept her up at night.  But Abigail's current situation called for more than fantasy-she needed a real fiance, or she'd be forced to leave.  That was when Callan noticed the curves his conservative secretary had been hiding.  Their counterfeit engagement was perfect-but was the arrangement business or pleasure?<br />One of the better books in this series.  Quite a few laughs, and some funny dialogue.  The two aunts are at times too much, but the author makes it move along and all ends well.	2003-01-24

Back Cover description: For the Negotiator, talk is never cheap.  In a moment, he has to make connections with the crazed and the desperate and the lost.  He has to promise,cajole and placate.  Success is a rush.  Failure would cripple a lesser man.  Above all, he must stay detached.  Beck Winters is the Negotiator.  Despite everything he's seen and done, Beck's still sane, but only because he never allows himself to get close to anyone.  Then during a hostage incident, he hears a voice over the phone line, Jennifer Barclay's voice.  Jennifer's in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Her plan has  always been to avoid excitement.  But that was before she was taken hostage...before the incident ended badly...and before she met the Negotiator.<br />There was just something about this book that made me feel uneasy.  Not the story, or the premise.  Beck belongs to a team, but no one is taking him seriously when he states one of the members is not up to par?  Also, no one realizes the sniper has a problem?  And, Beck's superior should have sent him (Beck) on vacation way before this.  I have no clue how real negotiators work, but I would hope that they would let one of the hostages know (in this case the adult) that the hostage taker has already harmed/killed a person.  There is also the issue as to why Beck feels he has to connect with Jennifer.  You'd have to read this book to understand why it made me uneasy.  I liked the premise, just not the result.	2003-01-24

Back Cover description: Brittany Astor wanted three things: to be beautiful, to marry Ethan Moss and to own a cat.  The rare, expensive Bengal kitten was a possibility.  Which led to her unexpected encounter with to man of her dreams.  To earn extra money, the struggling book editor answered an ad to read aloud.  Her employer wasn't the sweet little old lady she'd imagined but nasty, sexy Ethan.  Nor was the notorious playboy exactly what Brittany had been fantasizing about for years.  Temporarily blinded, Ethan was hiding himself away from the world.  For timid, plain Britt this was her chance to have a hot and torrid fling with Ethan.  But what about when fantasy time was over?<br />First, Brittany doesn't really come across as plain and timid.  Second, she might be struggling, but not much.  Third, some of the dialogue was erotic, but I think the author could have used something other than the school girl/principal theme.  That's my objection and why I only gave it 3 stars.	2003-01-22

After all, it's for the good of Colette, Inc. So what if I wind up losing something even more important...like my heart?<br />This wasn't the worst in the 20 AMBER COURT series, but only one of them was worth reading and this wasn't one of them.

Because silly Daddy's got it wrong and thinks Annie is in love with someone else, that's why...<br />This story isn't bad, just not great.

For she had come to Miracle Harbor to claim the ranch she had inherited, a home to call her own.  And it was all hers-for the price of a wedding ring.  Too bad the sexy cowboy who came with that little boy wanted her land-not her.  But Matt Donahue's heated gaze told another story.  About a man who longed for love just as much as Corrie did.  About a husband who could make her wedding dreams come true-if only he believed. <BR> <BR>There are two other books in this group-THE WEDDING LEGACY.  I haven't read them yet, and this is the third.  It starts out slightly annoying.  Corrie inherits a ranch, she has no idea what she's doing and won't take advice.  I can't stand it when authors do that.  Can't they think of any other avenue to generate tension between lead characters?  Anyway, it does get better, so I gave it 3 stars.	2003-01-22

So why was it that all her poise deserted her when she saw Jake again, still as attractive as before and infinitely more dangerous?<br />OK, why 2 stars.  I didn't really get any feeling from the characters, I couldn't even dislike them.  The story was different from most of the L.

An accident had erased Lucian Sinclair's memory of one night-the only night he'd shared with Raina Sarbanes.  So, when he met her again months later, he couldn't fathom why she disdained his up-till-now infallible charm.  Then Lucian touched her, and was overcome by a flashback-of bodies lovingly entwined and promises whispered in the dark...And when he looked into the eyes of Raina's baby daughter, Lucian realized this child was his.  He was determined to keep hold of his newfound family, but first he had to forge a new bond with the woman who had left an indelible mark on his soul...<br />This is part of the SECRETS series about the Sinclair family.  The story moves and you find yourself involved in the characters feelings.  If you go with the fact that Raina's very best friend, Melanie, doesn't tell her one of her brothers-in-law was in an accident, you can go along with the plot.  This is a better book than REESE'S WILD WAGER #1360, which I didn't like.	2003-01-15

But where were his words of love...and how could an ordinary gal like Holly believe anything this sexy-as-sin man declared?  Yet, something within her wanted to take the ultimate chance that she could bring this bachelor to heel.<br />Cute.  That's the word for this story.  Everybody's cute.  Or gorgeous.

He's wealthy, kind and absolutely gorgeous-and he's interested in me.  Ordinary, average Meredith Blair.  And not just as a date for the evening, but as something much more...permanent!<br />I gave this 4 stars because this is the only book in the 20 AMBER COURT series that is remotely believable, or readable.

The arrangement had seemed simple: a one year, no-love-involved commitment.  But Mattie, in all her experience, did the unthinkable:  She'd fallen for her husband.  Worse, she welcomed Josh's steamy stares, sizzling caresses and words of seduction.  And now the last thing Mattie wanted was for her torrid temporary marriage to end...<br />Not bad, not great.

No woman could shake his ivory tower of bachelorhood, even one as maddening ...and delectable ...as society princess Sydney.  But desire roared between them, and the innocent beauty granted Reese carte blanche with her body.  Their earth-shattering night together stripped away every remnant of his reason--and left a ferocious longing.  What would the irresistible bachelor do when the bet expired?  Round up those cards...or lay down a marriage proposal?<br />This is not one of my favorites in this series (SECRETS). The poker game wasn't that wild, and I liked Reese better in the other books.  Sydney was OK, but I had trouble warming up to her character.  As always, the rest of the brothers are around to stir up trouble, and all ends well.

Of course, she had a lot to thank him for-her new job with the twins among other things.  Had she misjudged him after all?  <br />Another good Cinderella story from Betty Neels.  Daisy works in a pre-school that has food poisoning, causing the school to shut down.  She meets Valentine in the hospital.  You know the story, and it has a happy ending.  The only drawback for me was that there was so much time spent with the kids.  Other than that, typical and enjoyable story.	2002-12-23

Back Cover description: \\"She doesn't know that I know that she's one desirable female.\\"-Montana Brubaker It had taken one second for ranch foreman Montana Brubaker to realize Syd Mac, gruff cowpoke, was really Sydney MacKenzie, all woman.  The feisty female had corralled herself a position on the Brubakers' Texas spread...and was now Montana's blushing new bunkmate.  Mr. Eligible Wrangler figured he'd play it cool and spend the summer learning the truth about Sydney's true agenda.  Except the excitement of sharing a rather small cabin with the all-too-desirable cowgirl was proving a little too hot for this Brubaker bachelor!<br />Not as good as MILLIONAIRE'S WAITRESS WIFE, but not bad.  Some funny scenes and not much of any sex, but a nice, unthreatening story.  My second C. Zane book, I'll try for a third.  I think there are a total of 5 brothers, so that means more stories.	2002-12-23

But what would a millionaire like Bradley Ackerman ever see in a gal from the secretarial pool?  The answer came as quite a surprise: he needed her to pose as his fiance.  \\"BE MINE...FOREVER!\\"  For his grandmother's sake, Bradley hoped Amber would go along with his charade.  He'd introduce her to his family, escort her to their \\"engagement\\" party and then part as friends. Until \\"Grandy\\" got it into her head to plan them a real wedding.<BR>Not a great story, not a bad one. I could go along with the plot, just not believe it. It was a little slow, and there were no surprises, and no disappointments either. This is the first title I've read by this author. I will try another one to see if this is her style.	2002-12-22

Back Cover description:  PROTECTION...AT ANY PRICE  To Melanie Hart, escape looked as futile as the dark night once Gabriel Sinclair discovered her and her son hiding in an abandoned farmhouse.  The beauty's barely hidden fear told Gabriel she was desperate.  And when she leveled her unwavering gaze at him, he felt...consumed.  Melanie didn't want to divulge her deepest secrets to her strong, attractive, would-be protector.  Yet she could sense Gabriel was a man of honor.  And in his embrace she finally felt safe.  Could she surrender her carefully guarded heart--or would temptation cause her to pay a precious price?<br />Fine story, terrific family and nice tension--you know the villain is going to find her, it's just a matter of when.  Gabe is just what we all want, and the brothers are too.  There are a few reasons it didn't get 5 stars.  One, she buys the car, doesn't register it and drives it across country--what the old owner didn't take the plates off of it?  Two, she's so afraid of being found, but she REALLY has to go to the auction--better she should have hid out for the day at Carla's.  Third, she and Gabe have a fight and he leaves her alone.  OK, so he had to leave, he couldn't have called one of his brothers to come over?  I know the last sets up the confrontation with the villain, but it didn't work for me.  However, Melanie is a strong woman.  She protects her own and will do whatever it takes.  <BR>I have read two other books about the brothers, but they are not in Intimate Moments, the rest of the stories seem to be in the Silhouette Desire group.

She didn't know him well enough to even guess.  It was a marriage of convenience, after all, not a love match.  Colin had mad it clear that he wanted a down-to-earth partner to help him care for his brother's orphaned children--not a dreamy girl with her head full of romance.  Even so, Eustacia found herself hoping against hope that one day, he might grow to love her as much as she loved him...<br />The reviewer from Ottawa, Canada has some valid points, but you don't read Betty Neels for reality.  However, she makes you understand why the A-levels are useless in the first three pages.  Nicely done story, strong characters, and happy ending.  I always love the descriptions in Ms. Neels' books--food, clothing, places and homes.  And I love the cars these guys drive; they cost more than my house.	2002-12-19

He'd discovered her on a storm-swept beach, bruised, beautiful--and in need of his protection.  But sharing close quarters with sweet Jessica soon led to spiraling passion.  And Marcus learned too late that this young beauty had entrusted him not only with her life--but with her innocence.  Now, as they waited out the danger together, Marcus battled an even greater enemy to this bachelor heart--love!<br />This is another book in the A YEAR OF LOVING DANGEROUSLY series.  It was OK, but I really couldn't see secret agents not paying attention to the real issue, catching Simon and the kidnappers.  Hiding out for a few weeks hoping to be found just wasn't doing it.  The whole plot could have been worked better/different--you'd have to read this to understand.  And if you've read the others, you'll read this.  This book also sets up the Russell Devane character for the next book.  This book could have used some more action.	2002-12-17

But convincing brooding widower Kane Fielding is less easy...He's determined to keep his distance and ensure his dark secret stays hidden. But to keep his son, Kane is prepared to do anything. Even the one thing he's promised he'll never do again...marry!<br />OK the dark secret is sort of obvious, and sad. I gave this 4 stars for the way the author treats the subject. I also liked the sexual tension between Kane and Megan. Good, solid story about the way life can take our choices from us, and then give a lifeline--if you can see it. In this story Megan is Kane's lifeline, he just has to realize it.	2002-12-17

Then she spotted him--a pale, ghostly figure, his T-shirt soaked with blood, his intense dark blue eyes begging her not to be afraid.  After issuing a desperate warning, \\"Don't go back there, don't meet...\\" he disappeared before her eyes into thin air...The warning echoing in her mind, Rachel returned to her boardinghouse, where she was startled in the hallway by her reclusive neighbor, Jay Barnes.  There was something familiar about the mysterious, moody man, something Rachel couldn't put her finger on...until he switched on a light and she stared into his passionate, dark blue gaze...<br />This story starts out OK, but bogs down.  After awhile you feel you're in the fog too.  The story didn't seem to go forward, just sideways.  It dragged, and there didn't seem to be much mystery.  I gave it and extra star, because the author did make you feel the time, weather and place.  Not a bad story, just not one I stayed up all night to finish.	2002-12-17

Now, with the same ruthless determination, Rafe insisted that she become his bride instead.  Dazed, Shaan accepted his proposal, but she was also confused: until this moment, Rafe had acted as if he despised her.  Suddenly he wanted to proclaim her to the world as his wife and, behind closed doors, to have her in his bed!<br />Not her best.  I didn't like this one.  It was predictable and I couldn't like either character.  She had no backbone, and he was manipulative/sly--not uncommon with these books, but not what I expected from a Michelle Reid story.

She has lost her memory, and no one has claimed her for over a year.  Then her husband finds her.  There are the usual plot twists, and the sexual tension is great.

Keeping her secret seemed safe--right up until she opened her door and found Nick on the other side...<br />I wasn't crazy about the scene in Nick's bedroom where all three women show up.  If you can get over the fact that this guy is a stereotype for a \\"woman in every port\\", you might like his character, I wasn't happy with it.  When will this guy grow up?

Gideon Ironheart could tell that just from the sound of her voice.  No other woman had ever made him want to quit his wandering ways before.  But then, no other woman had ever rescued him at gunpoint from a barroom brawl, either.  Tall powerful--and ready to take on the whole town--Gideon Ironheart was &quot;an Indian with and attitude,&quot; all right.  Deputy Sheriff Sara Yates was sure of it.  But there was something else about him--something hidden, sensual. Something that made her want to tell him her darkest fears.

Soon Grace began to care again about something--about this sexy single dad and his daughter.  But would it all disappear when she found out the truth about Jack Dugan?<br />I agree with the reviewer from Florida.  Great story and interesting plot.  The author has done a remarkable job given the size of these types of books.  You like and feel for both Grace and Jack.  The plot description is slightly misleading in that Grace starts to care, but it's about finding the people who sold the guns that killed her daughter.  As this part of the plot develops, she realizes that she has to live.  The author's feel for the grief that this woman is going through is amazing.  Hopefully, the author will write about Grace's partner, Beau Riley.	2002-12-12

Now Lady Elizabeth's carefully laid plans will go awry as Cupid joins the fray and Beatrice and David come face-to-face with the past amid holiday celebrations that will show them fthe true meaning of love...<br />This book seemed to go on forever.  I realize that a development of plot and the characters are necessary, but it felt like forever.  The two main characters, David and Beatrice, were OK, but they kept tiptoeing around one another.  And Beatrice began to seem like a martyr, not a person. The two younger women were good, but the two younger men were so-so.  Also, Vaughan's character was unpleasant in the beginning, and I just couldn't like him.   If you like this author and really slow plots, give this another star.	2002-12-11

Interesting and attention getting story.  Some sexual buildup, but you have to wait to the very end for the big scene.  Good solid character development and growth as two people who are strong and vulnerable learn to live with and love one another.  A little mystery story thrown in, some plot tension from the bad guy, but more a love story.  There are 3 loose ends, the other two women from the wagon train and the young woman who works (?) in the local whorehouse.  There is a preview of one of the other stories at the end of the book.  Hope it's as well done as this one.	2002-12-07

Back Cover description:  THE AGENT: Stunning spitfire Margarita Alfonsa de las Fuentes.  THE MISSION GONE AWRY:  Being taken hostage by the traitor she was trying to trap.  THE ESCAPE:  Fleeing into the jungle with her darkly handsome rescuer!  Although headstrong Margarita was mesmerized by Carlos Caballero's fearless courage, she wasn't about to bow down to any man.  But the temptress in her yearned to surrender to her ardent suitor's sizzling seduction.  Now, with a murderous band of criminals hot on their trail, the beautiful secret spy struggled with the contradictory emotions Carlos's fierce protectiveness stirred in her.  How was she supposed to choose between sworn duty...and unrelenting desire?<br />I liked the fact that both main characters were Latinos, and both strong willed.  But these two needed to talk about a lot of things--they always clashed, and over silly stuff.  At least she did, Carlos was very patient, although he was a little too controlled, and there is the problem.  Margarita wants him to let loose, get wild, and he doesn't.  I have some issues with this undercover operation, why does she have to go in to interview this creep right away, she can't wait till morning?  And I also think we were all in the jungle too long.  I do like the choice Margarita makes in the end, nicely done.	2002-12-07

It was love at first sight for Britannia Smith when she met Professor Jake Luitingh van Thien and she shamelessly followed him to Holland, hoping to see more of him.  She succeeded--and to her joy, he proposed!  But just when all seemed perfect, she met Madeleine de Venz.  In every way Madeleine was right for Jake, and Britannia became more convinced that to go ahead with the wedding might ruin Jake's life.<br />I almost didn't read this one.  The back cover description makes it seem as if she is a stalker.  She winds up in Holland, but she goes with a friend.  The story is filled with descriptions of the area, clothes and food.  It is the same story as always--a bit of Cinderella--but always enjoyable.  Britianna is strong and likable.  Jake is a prince--what more do we need.	2002-12-07

Beautiful schoolteacher Emma Davenport was just the sort of woman Joe Sutter avoided.  She was sweet and sincere and set his pulse racing.  But Joe had his own deep-secret hurt to contend with.  Giving in to his true feelings for Emma wouldn't be fair--to either of them.  And yet, something wouldn't let him walk away...Emma knew love was a precious gift.  If only she could convince Joe to believe in it, as well.  For if any man was meant to fulfill her dreams--and father her babies--it was Joe.  And she'd move heaven and earth to prove it to him...<br />Give this book another star if you like really sad, unhappy stories.  Yes, it turns out alright at the end, but the getting there was tough.  I'm not giving the plot away when I tell you Joe's secret is he can't have children.  You sort of figure that out by page 64. The rest of the book deals with all of the stuff that comes from people who want children and can't have them.  Not a story I really enjoyed.  If however, you like this type of plot, you just might like this book.	2002-12-04

Nick Evans needs a wife to secure an inheritance.  He doesn't need any kind of romantic involvement, and so he proposes marriage to the first woman he meets--Shelby Wright.  She's shocked, of course, but Nick can be very persuasive.  And as he points out, Shelby runs an odd-job-business--can't she view marriage as just a temporary assignment?  Only, Nicks' beginning to realize that Shelby Wright is the sweetest business deal he's ever handled.  Too band the terms of their agreement don't cover falling in love!<br />If you can go along with the plot, it's a fast, fun read.  No sex, but a nice buildup of sexual tension. Also both characters are likable and the story moves along, it doesn't drag.  On page 184--almost the end--Nick describes why he loves her, why he can't do without her, it's lovely.	2002-12-04

With a newborn daughter and only herself to rely on, she was running from the shallow life she'd been living.  Circumstances had changed and now she wanted more security than money could buy.  Without looking back, she was heading to safety and a new start--until a blizzard stopped her and she had to ask a stranger for help.  He came with a Stetson, a gruff voice and an even gruffer manner, but he was their only chance for survival in the snowbound car.  He led them to a temporary refuge, then offered her permanent security.  It was everything she needed, but would it leave her wanting more?<br />Fine story, and like the other reviewers, I was sorry it ended.  Lily has chosen her child over less important things, and Quist is looking for sister.  He finds love.  Nice, strong development of the characters and the author's description of the blizzard will make you feel the cold too.  The scene at the end where she gets the cowboy D.J to stand near her when her ex-brother-in-law shows up was great.  She has learned that she doesn't have to shoulder everything herself--she can get help.	2002-12-04

Saddened at the secret of his daughter's birth, haunted by a deathbed promise, Dillon storms Thea Kearney's highlands cottage, intent on claiming 'his lasses'.  In wrenching grief Thea had once sought comfort in Dillon's sheltering arms, but she and her baby scarcely need him now!  Yet Dillon's salty brogue and sea-swept sorcery shatter her resistance and win her heart...until she discovers the man-to-man pledge that even the roguish Dillon apparently feels compelled to honor...<br />The plot description makes it appear that these characters are forceful and take charge types.  That is misleading.  I very rarely cry when reading romance stories, sometimes I get a little teary, but not cry.  Well, this book will get you to turn on the tears, but in a good way, the way you cry when something is touching and to the heart.  All the characters are likable, from the dead husband, Dillon, Thea and the islanders. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the scene near the end where she finds out what the promise is and takes exception to it, instead of seeing it as a last gift from her husband.  Try it, good story.	2002-12-04

I tried to like this book, but it was just annoying at times.  It reminded me of another story like this, but the therapist had been abused and didn't like to be touched--I can't remember the author though.  This guy, Symon was a whining, spoiled brat and Pamela is just too perky.  One of first things she does it put him on a low-fat diet--that annoyed me right off.  He's lost weight and she decides the first battle in his physical therapy treatment is going to be his diet!  Why not get him interested in his treatment and then worry about his food.  Doesn't anyone eat real food any more?  Why is low-fat fiber filled food supposed to save the world.	2002-12-04

Gerard Woodward was the husband Leah had dreamed of--handsome, powerful and wealthy.  Until she overheard something that made her realize he'd ruthlessly seduced her into marriage for his own ends.  She decided to go...  Six months later the fugitive bride comes face-to-face with her husband once more.  Well, he looks like he husband, he makes love like her husband...but he claims he's her husband's twin brother!<br />This story got 2 stars because I agree with the reviewer from Seattle--this heroine is dense.  Leah can't figure out that if she hasn't seen her husband for 6 months, the guy just might have had an accident?  The story might have been better if Leah realized this and just played along to see what happens.  Sort of 'cat playing with mouse' plot--how far will the hero go to regain his love. Not a bad story, just frustrating.	2002-12-04

Louie Powers knew his teacher was the mom he'd been wishing for. Miss Logan was everything a rambunctious kid could want--kind and understanding of the trouble some boys finds themselves in. Now Louie had to find a way to make his lawman dad see this perfect match. So Louie stirred up some mischief with the lady that required the sheriff's diligent attention. After all, if they were forced to spend time together, surely they'd fall in love. Right?<br />This is the second book in the Silver Creek series. Molly Logan moves here as a temporary teacher. She is divorced. The sheriff, Judd Powers is divorced. His wife walked out on him and his son. OK, up until Molly tells Judd she thinks his son needs testing for a learning disability I liked this story. I left the 3 star rating because this issue might not bother other readers, but it bothers me. There isn't much sex till almost the end, but the sexual tension does build and the author does a good job of making you wait for it. This story deals with people who are hurt and searching for love--they find it--and now have to find the courage to grasp it.	2002-12-03

To hear Glenwood's womenfolk whisper, notorious Austin Lucas was temptation incarnate.  Delicious as forbidden sin, he even tempted bashful, cherubic Rebecca Chambers.  But, amid countless adoring females, he'd never notice the tongue-tied do-gooder.  So who'd have thought that a stormy night and a blushing request would have Austin bedding innocent Rebecca?  Or that, after the unspeakably sexy fact, he'd make an honest woman of her?  Had the small-town saint led the sinner to salvation?  Or would Austin merely give his child a name--and Rebecca everlasting heartache?<br />I wanted to give it 3 stars but because it is the best in the series, I gave it four.  All the brothers and their half-sister get their own story. I've read them all, just not in order. Rebecca's character in THE BEST BRIDE, seemed somewhat stronger then in this one. Also she is in charge of a home for unwanted/orphaned children and can't remember to use birth control!  And Austin, who brings his lovers to his home has no condoms anywhere?  This just strained my belief somewhat.  If you can get over this, the story moves along and develops with a nice pace and likable people.	2002-12-03

Yet within weeks of arriving she was married to the devastating Professor Radmer ter Bavinck!  Radmer had assured Lavinia that the marriage would be on a friendly basis only--he needed a kind stepmother for his daughter and a competent housekeeper to run his home.  It seemed to be the ideal arrangement-- for everyone except Lavinia!<br />The plot was slow.  I agree with the reveiwer from Santa Fe that this story could have been better.  Do the two main characters even like one another? It's hard to tell.  The ending was strange too.  Are these two even happy?  Not what I consider a good story from this author.	2002-12-01

For Cathy treasured the moments when he bared his soul, too.  Then a twist of fate brought her face-to-face with her fantsy man...and into his home.  Stone was many things, but mostly he was out of reach.  Rich, good-looking and mysteriously sexy.  What on earth would he see in her?  The vulnerable virgin was determined to transform herself into the beauty she pretended to be.  But that would come with a price.  For her, that price was falling for the brooding millionaire bachelor who had sworn never to love again...<br />If you can go with the plot, it's a fine story.  A little reminiscent of the movie, \\"Bells Are Ringing\\" with Judy Hilliday and Dean Martin.  But this hero is wounded physically and in his heart.  Cathy is a 20 pound overweight young woman who has given up her dreams.  They both need one another, and the story deals with them accepting and coming to grips with the love they feel for each other.	2002-12-01

The handsome stranger who'd saved her from a storm was now asking her for help.  And he was inviting her to live with him.  Sure, she could prepare evening meals and give him sponge baths, but nothing had prepared her for those sexy glances he threw her way...Jordan Haynes couldn't let Holly be alone for Christmas.  Not when visions of her were dancing in his head night after night.  No, he could play the needy patient as well as anyone...and convince her to keep him company through the holidays-- if not longer. <br />This is the last book in this series about the brothers.  There is one more about the half sister.  Likeable lead characters and the story does progress OK, but talk about a guy that broods. The cat really annoyed me however.  Jordan risked his life for the cat, and as much as it might annoy cat lovers out there--a man's life is worth more.  I would have felt better if he had risked his life for her.  This is where you find out why he dislikes Louise (housekeeper).  This is also the reason I didn't give it another star.  Even Jordan had to have realized at his age that his dad, an adult, seduced a 17 year old with no experience.  His dad did it a lot to just about any one in a skirt.  Why blame Louise?  This part annoyed me.  Holly is carrying around her own 'baggage'-- but at least she's willing to take a risk.  If you have read the others, you'll read this.	2002-12-01

Amabel didn't expect to see him again, so it was strange how Oliver seemed to reappear every time Amabel was in a spot of bother!  Trying to be an independent woman was proving difficult with such a chivalrous and charming man on hand.  But Amabel was left wondering, could their loving friendship become a basis for marriage?<br />Another good story from Ms. Neels.  This time all the characters are English.  This heroine does have a family, just not a great one (except the Aunt).  There is also the dog and cat problem--you know-- no one else wants them, so off the heroine goes and gets into trouble.  This hero is not as unapproachable as some of the others Ms. Neels uses, actually he's nice right from the start.	2002-11-28

However, I wasn't really thrilled with the other two stories.  The hero in Ms. Moore's story just wasn't appealing-his transformation from vain jerk to love of the heroine's life wasn't convincing. In Ms. Barclay's story, the hero just doesn't seem to be all that smart.  It doesn't seem at times as if the hero or heroine are in the same story--pagan christians, christians, druids--what?	2002-11-23

There is a nice steady buildup of story and characters.  An overview of what it must/might have been like in the south after the Civil War.  I liked both main characters, and the author does a great job in making the reader feel concerned about them.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for two reasons.  First, I felt that as this story occurs just 3 years after the end of the war, there just wasn't enough tension or hate.  Yes there were fires and animosity between the army and townspeople, but you never really felt threatened.  Second, there was no reference I remember reading about the ex-slaves.  Where did they go?  What happened to them?  Had any come back?  <br />There is an author note on the last page about the prison in NC.  I was hoping for information about the number of southern women who actually did marry northern soldiers.  There were so many deaths amoung the men in this war, that if the southern women were getting married, that meant that the northern women weren't.  All in all though, a fine story.	2002-11-23

When prim professor Zara Paxton ventured to distant Bahania, she wanted only to find the father she'd never known.  But Dad proved to be a desert king--and he promptly put his &quot;princess&quot; under the protection of a muscular, mesmerizing sheik who set Zara's virginal senses aflame...yet refused to quench the fire!  Bedding a virgin princess would mean his beheading!  Steely security liaison Rafe Stryker scorned lasting love.  So how did one bespectacled brunette sneak into his heart and make him throb with the urge to taste her sweetness?  Clearly, innocent Princess Zara wanted to be his woman.  But taking her was tantamount to treason.  Still, even a sheik could only stand so much temptation...<br />Fun read if you can suspend disbelief that any of this would even happen.  This book is part of the author's  Desert Rogues series.  It moves along and the characters are OK.  The princes personalities are not that developed, but they are probably waiting for their own stories.	2002-11-22

Minute by minute, Nick's paid preformance was feeling all too real.  And soon Hannah wanted him to be a husband for life...<br />If this is the end to the Hometown Heartbreakers series, then anyone who has read all the other books, should read this one too.  It introduces the half-sister to the brothers-Travis, Jordan, Kyle and Craig.  It's a little involved, there is a slight suspense story included because of Nick's undercover work.

Poor plain Becky fell desperately, hopelessy in love...<br />Becky is a nurse, the Baron is a doctor.  This is the second story of Ms. Neels's that takes place in Norway.  For the first part of the book, Becky and the Baron's mother go to Norway, then Holland/Netherlands.  The descriptions of Norway, Holland and the country travelled through are good.  You feel as though you've gone on the trip too.  The story moves along, nothing feels rushed, and love wins in the end, what more could you ask for.	2002-11-19

But being a plain, practical girl, Margo knew the professor was most unlikely to look her way.  It took a tragic accident to bring an offer of marriage--from the professor.  It was a practical proposal, but as Margo was taken into the bosom of his family over Christmas in Holland, she did wonder whether he might, someday, return her love...<br />This is one of the better Ms. Neels' stories.  Margo is not a doormat, and the professor is not as stoic as some of the other male characters have been.  The story moves along nicely and you do get a little teary towards the end.	2002-11-17

Back Cover description:  With his sexy Stetson and X-rated grin, was Sheriff Travis Haynes Glenwood's leading lady-killer or Elizabeth Abbott and her daughter's knight in shining armor?  Finally pulling her life back together, Elizabeth couldn't afford more heartbreak.  Still, Travis was awfully tempting...With every fragment of her betrayed heart, Elizabeth longed to trust the legendary lawman--enough to become his bride and give her child a daddy.  But would her shattering past forever hold her hostage...even from the love that could make her whole?  <br />I gave this 3 stars because I liked Travis, and the way the story started.  However, about half-way through the book, I became annoyed.  Sorry to give part of the plot away, but Elizabeth was married (?) to a bigamist.  She met the guy while in college.  Her move to Glenwood is so she can start over where no one knows her. Now she's attracted to Travis, who has the Haynes boys' reputation of love 'em and leave 'em.  The difference here is that everyone knows the guy, he's not married and just about everyone but Elizabeth can see he's serious about her.  The last quarter of the book was just so much emoting about--how can I trust ever again--that I just read the end to finish it.  This is part of the Haynes brothers series, so if you've read any of the others, you'll probably read this too.	2002-11-17

The professor is not a doctor, he's in finance and Deborah is a nanny.  The professor, a widower, has a young daughter.  Deborah marries him, and then they fall in love.  One of the better stories from Ms. Neels and interesting in that the heroine comes from a loving family, and is not dirt poor.	2002-11-17

Back Cover description: On The Run...Union Captain John Howe escaped a living hell when he tunneled his way out of a Confederate prison camp, though his ordeal was far from over. Now he was saddled with his own prisoner, the sad, stubborn Amanda Douglas, on a journey that would change their lives forever...Even her previous spartan existence had not prepared Amanda for the dangerous trek she was now making--entirely against her will. But when John gazed at her through his beautiful, haunted eyes, bright with fever, she was lost. Could a privileged Yankee son and a poor, proud Rebel girl keep their love safe from the rest of the world?<br />Great story. There is a nice feel for the times that different social groups inhabited during the Civil War. The journey north away from the Confederate prison had just enough tension to make it believeable. When John gets home, the scene where he collaspes makes you feel that you're there. His love for Amanda also rings true. John's mother is the villian in this story, I just wish his father's character was more developed. This is the first historical by Ms. Reavis that I've read. I like her contemporary stories that deal with the Armed Forces. Now I'll try to get the rest of her other historical books.	2002-11-17

Mallon had thought she was stranded and homeless until Harris came along.  After hearing her story, he didn't hesitate to offer her a job as his housekeeper.  It all seemed too good to be true--Mallon had found work she really enjoyed, in a beautiful country house.  But then she discovered that it was too good to be true.  She was quite happy being mistress of Harris's home, but not of his heart...Whatever was Harris thinking of when he insisted she pretend to be his girlfriend?<br />Mallon runs out of the house where she has been housekeeper because the owner attacks her.  She's had problems with a step-father and step-brother.  As she is wandering down a deserted road the hero stops.  I just couldn't believe she would get in a car with the guy.  Not after being attacked.  He has a cell phone, he should have called the police.  If nothing else Mallon was in shock.  I liked Harris, I just wasn't crazy about Mallon's choices, and I had trouble with the whole story.	2002-11-17

In this book Lucius is a businessman and Katrina is a book illustrator.  I find that I dislike Ms. Neels' stories when the nasty, and in this one the sister is nasty, relatives are catered to.  Not only that but Katrina loves her despite the sister's selfishness.  When I read Betty Neels' books with this type of relative I just want to scream.  If that doesn't bother you, give it another star.	2002-11-11

And Johanna Patterson was the kind of woman who could make him leave the past behind.  But how would he ever convince this reclusive spinster to open up her heart to him and his boys?  It seemed to Johanna that she had always been alone.  Until the day that Tate Montgomery turned up at her farm with a ready-made family, and an offer that would change her life forever. <br />The book moves well until the sister-in-law shows up.  I found that part of the story annoying.  Johanna grows to trust Tate, she grows to love the boys and they put their pasts to rest.  I didn't find myself crying, so maybe I missed something that the other reviewers saw.	2002-11-11

I agree with the other two reviewers,(HI and GA) heartwarming and cosy.  This story gives you a good feel all the way through and it's worth it just so you can read the letter at the end.

Cordelia knew she was plain.  She also knew what good manners were, and the high-and-mighty doctor didn't have any!  But there was magic in Vienna that could transform even the most unlikely people.  Much to her dismay, Cordelia fell in love with him anyway.  And Charles soon discovered that quiet and unassuming ways had a knack of stealing a man's heart--without him even realizing it. <br />This is one of the better Betty Neels books.  It's the first I've read that takes place in Vienna.  Both Charles and Cordelia are English.  She is governess to his niece (a temporary post).  The descriptions of the city are done so that you'd like to go there.  Ms. Neels describes the food and clothing with an eye to detail.  I love the way she gives the whole menu everytime anyone eats.  Good story, strong heroine and love.  Another hit by a terrific author.	2002-11-10

Hard as nails inside and out, Sergeant Matt Beltran obeyed only one rule: Need no one, and let no one need him.  So what was the steely loner to do when someone left a precious baby girl--allegedly his--in his red sports car?  Regroup? Stand tall? Run!  But Corey Madsen, the tyke's temporary foster mom, clearly had other ideas.  The soft, pretty preacher's widow melted Matt's armor--and &quot;Short Stuff&quot; herself got a toehold in his heart. Why , the terrifying twosome actually made Matt feel like a husband and father!  Whoa! Was Matt's worst nightmare becoming an impossible dream?<br />What a great story!  I read OLDER WOMAN first--that's another great book.  These characters are believeable and likable. The caring, concern and the fact that these people could be someone we know is another way the author gets us to care.  About the only thing I didn't like was the baby's mother, Rita.  Her character wasn't consistent. First she abandons the baby, then she comes back, then she cares, then she...you get the picture. There is another book about her, I haven't made up my mind if I'm going to read it or not.  But get this one, it's a keeper.	2002-11-10

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wanted a romance between Alberich and someone.  Great dialogue and discussions about the nature of honor and truth.  The book is dedicated to the NYC fallen firefighter/rescue crews.  At times the story seems to have parallels to now--in relegious fanactics against democracies, not just the US, but any democratic country that allows its people to choose their own way.  I have tried other books in this series, this is one of the few I really liked.	2002-11-10

But it was for her own good! For Jack was Navajo--and trouble, to boot.  Yet Meggie stubbornly returned to the reservation.  Bearing a fatherless child.  And Jack could fight their love no longer.  He made Meggie his bride and Coyote howled with evil glee.  For soon Meggie would have to choose:  between fulfillment and heartbreak, her beloved husband...and her unborn baby.<br />This is the third book in the FAMILY BLESSINGS series I have read (I read them out of order).  They don't get better.  The people in this book are suppossed to care about and love one another, yet all they do is cause confusion and heartbreak.  Meggie comes home, marries her love and the whole world falls apart because no one talks to anyone.  This is now about two-thirds of the way through the book, by the time the hero gets arrested, the plot has gotten so muddy, it's just annoying. I hope MOTHER TO BE is the last in this series and the author will write about the characters in her other books...	2002-11-10

She is very good at what she does.  Max Oosterwelde is a visiting consultant.  They both have the same godfather (another surgeon).  That's the way they get thrown together all the time.

And though she accepted a job as his housekeeper, Ashley was determined to make her own happiness, without the heartbreak of loving a man.  No matter how tempting that man was...It was Jeff's nature to protect, but his heart was off-limits--even to the woman and child he came home to each night.  For life had made Jeff a hardened soldier, not a man to love.  And despite the hope he saw shining in Ashley's eyes, Jeff didn't dare dream she could truly be his...<br />This book reminded somewhat of the SHEIK'S SECRET BRIDE.  It has the strong hero, who stands alone, beautifully behaved child and attractive single mom.  I liked this story, just not enough to give it any more stars.  Also, both characters talked too much about how they had to overcome their pasts.  Neither of these two showed much hope, let alone any joy that they had survived life's problems.  The ending was good, but you would expect that in a romance novel.	2002-11-08

No sir, Kathy had sworn off love and marriage, and nothing in the rugged marine's arsenal could break through Kathy's defenses.  Nothing except...A baby?  When Brian's surprise daughter ended up in his care, Kathy couldn't ignore the tiny tot's plaintive cries or the instant dad's S.O.S. And when the sexy marine proposed a marriage of convenience, Kathy couldn't say no.  After all, the passionate dad had melted Kathy's resolve--but could she commit to a loveless union after Brian and baby had captured her heart?<br />Typical and run-of-the-mill story.  Why do I always like the male characters in this series and have a problem with the females?  There is something about the female lead in this one that doesn't ring true, first she's avoiding him, then when he has a baby she can't stay away?  Even Brian's own mother can't be bothered to show up for a few days before her cruise to help out.  I really like Brian, so read the story for him.	2002-11-08

And what would happen to their marriage then?<br />This is another typical Betty Neels story-doctor and nurse, but I liked the way the plot moved, and the love grew between them.  Though at times Duert's character could be annoying.  Why a wife, why not a governess?  Venetia's character was quiet and shy, but not a doormat.  And the ending was slightly different--the doctor gets jealous.	2002-11-07

This maddening, white woman was already raising two of her brother's cast-off kids--yet her heart made room for one more.  Lucas was grudgingly intrigued--and downright infuriated!  And Coyote smiled...<br />Interesting to read for the information about Navaho culture.  I liked the characters and the fact that they were struggling with everyday issues--food and shelter.  Sloan and Lucas were two people who needed each other, but I felt her character was more honest.  The issue of who should get the child could have been dealt with in the beginning of the story.  This way Sloan would have made the choice to move west, and the story could have gone on from there.  There is also a mystery involved, that is slow to develope, but answers questions about the dead brother's motives.	2002-11-07

So why had the People selected her to cajole Johnny out of this sudden self-exile?  All she could do was bother him senseless!  But aggravation soon sparked passion.  And the lifelong warriors made love.  But could they make peace?  For they'd already made a baby...<br />This book has characters from a previous book, ONE OF OUR OWN.  It was OK just not riveting.  I liked the character of Johnny Becenti but wasn't crazy about Lillian, she got annoying.  Her character was known for her plain speaking, but when it was important for her to say something she didn't.

Still, she was astonished when sinfully handsome Malik Khan, Crown Prince of exotic El Bahar, hijacked her and her little girl off an airliner and into his lavish palace.  Why would the sexy desert prince want a passably pretty schoolteacher from San Bernadino?  Dazed, breathless and mesmerized with desire, Liana quickly became Malik's royal bride.  But dare she entrust her daughter--or her heart--to a man who would give them anything but his love?  Or might a caring American mother and child finally move this proud, imperious monarch and make his kingdom complete?<br />This was an OK ending to the Desert Rogues brothers series.  It just wasn't a great story.  This teacher is going to be in this country for two years and it feels like she doesn't have a clue about the country.  Also, I agree with some of the other reviewers about how different Malik is in this book than in the other two books.  And, what's with these perfect children these heroines always have?  If this kid was any better behaved, she'd be a saint.	2002-11-06

However, this one is a little darker than most of her other stories. There is not any of that offbeat humor some of the stories have and I gave it three stars because I didn't care for the resolution of the conflict between Ione and her father.

Needs that only the right man could satisfy--or the right marine...<br />This book got 3 stars because of the hero.  There is something about these brothers you have to like.  Annie however, ticked me off.  He is there for her in more ways than one, and she keeps comparing him to the baby's father.  I know, it's the plot, but why does it have to be so annoying.	2002-11-06

She is not an author I care to read.  Also, I'm not crazy about Tanith Lee.  I always feel like I've missed the point of her stories.  Halfway through this  book I had to struggle to finish the stories.  The first half of the book (other than the Anne Rice story) was fine, then the stories got weird/uncomfortable.  That being said, if you like the vampire myth, there are a lot of good/great stories in this book.  My favorite is Jack by Connie Willis.

Caroline had never imagined that anyone would want to marry her--she wasn't pretty or clever in any way.  But the imposing Professor Radinck Thoe van Erckelens did propose to her--and having speedily fallen in love with him, she accepted.  Radinck was clear about what he wanted in a wife--a convenient hostess!  Caroline had to decide whether to settle for that, or set about changing Radinck's feeling for her.<br />Another good Betty Neels story.  This plot is slightly different in that there is really no beautiful girlfriend to cause friction.  The friction comes from Caroline trying to get Radinck to notice, care and love her.  Nice pacing and the plot moves.  My only complaint is that the ending seems rushed.	2002-11-05

First she's mousy, then she's a beauty-make up your mind. She spends the entire book stating that she's a coward.  Big deal.  I didn't care about these characters and the plot dragged.

That might, of course, have something to do with Lady Manderly's nephew--Professor Alexander Cator!<br />This heroine has a strong character and can stand up for herself.

But there was no danger of her returning home.  Florina loved her new job as cook in the household of eminent consultant William Sedley.  And it wasn't long before she realized that she loved her employer, too.  But she had no chance of attracting his attention when he was engaged to be married to the glamorous Wanda!<br />I liked this for the nice pacing of the story. Florina's character wasn't wimpy, just loyal.  The buildup of the attraction between her and William was nicely paced.  I did think the ending was slightly rushed, but all in all this was one of the better stories the author has written.  Too bad Ms. Neels didn't include some recipes in this one.	2002-11-01

But seduce tough-talking Nurse Katherine Meehan, who'd tended to him after his copter crash?  Impossible!  True, they were now next-door neighbors--yet they were years apart.  And while Kate had survived breast cancer, Cal had barely survived hell... So just because Cal caught Kate crying in the rain...and her fussy feline cozied up to him...and the church ladies started matchmaking...and Kate suddenly looked so damn desirable--were those any reasons for a wounded warrior to woo a reluctant older woman?  Besides, between Kates's stubborn defenses and Cal's mule-headed machismo, could these two survivors...survive each other?<br />This story is written from the guy's point of view.  You don't realize it till you are really into the plot.  This is a really nice guy.  So is Kate and the church ladies. I even liked the cat in this one!  The story moves, the pacing is smooth and the characters don't whine.  Get it, read it.	2002-11-01

Lately, though, the single dad was targeting only Jill Bradford, his sons' new nanny.  Two parts sweetness, one part sin, the pint-size redhead proved a wizard with his three rambunctious boys.  So what made this miracle-worker insist she was strictly hired help? Could a houseful of Haynes males ambush her wary heart...and make her a mother and wife?<br />Interesting that the plot involves both hero and heroine with past issues that get in the way of love.  The story moves along and the relationship between the boys and Jill developes at an even pace.  In the real world, they'd all be in therapy for a few years. This is the first book I've read in this series and I think I started with the last in the group.  I'm looking for the others, hope I find them.	2002-10-30

I liked this book, just not enough to give it more than 3 stars.  One of the things that annoyed me was the sex they had in the beginning of the book. The premise is that Angela decides to have a 'one-night stand' with Dan because that's what he does. She gets so carried away with the sex that she ignores the use of a condom by asking him if he's healthy!  This is a guy she just wants sex with because of his reputation for 'one-night stands' and she takes his word that he's healthy. Not believeable.  That said, the rest of the story is OK and both Angela and Dan grow to realize that they can risk love for the joy it brings.	2002-10-30

After all, Ryan Lawford was way out of her league.  So the temporary nanny concentrated on bridging the distance between Ryan and his precious orphaned niece.  But living under the same roof with this irresistible man wasn't exactly easy...Business and balance sheets had once been Ryan's whole world.  But those things seemed less important now that his adorable ward and her enticing caretaker had become an integral part of his life.  Sweet Cassie was quickly turning into the woman of his fantasies, but was this determined bachelor prepared to take on the role of her dream groom?<br />This book was fine.  Nothing too spectacular, just a nice easy story.  I could have done without the baby talk though.  The only other thing that annoyed me was that Ryan is the head of his own company--he couldn't get any of his staff to help out?  Well, I guess if he did, there would be no story.	2002-10-30

Louisa didn't want to marry the boring Frank, nor did she want to live with her stepmother.  She was fortunate to get, after completing her training, what sounded like a pleasant and challenging nursing job--in Norway!  Louisa was delighted, even though her patient, Claudia Savage, did cause some problems--not helped by the austere unco-operative attitude of Claudia's brother Simon.  She couldn't understand why he was so disagreeable...<br />This is the first Betty Neels story I've read where the hero wasn't a doctor and the setting wasn't Holland/Netherlands. The descriptions of Norway were fine. What I didn't like was the plot.  The patient is an alcoholic. No one tells Louisa that, not the two doctors, not the brother (until halfway through the book). This is the first book of Ms. Neels where the doctors actually are incompetent.  What else could you say it is when the two doctors never say to the nurse what the problem is-they gloss it over with euphemisms.  I never warmed up to the hero, there was just something I found unattractive.  If that wasn't enough, Claudia has a miracle cure for her drinking-she falls in love.  Sorry, I just can't buy this storyline.	2002-10-30

Betty Neels writes good stories about normal (regular) people.  We can't all be rich or beautiful.  With some of us it doesn't matter how many times we go to the salon, we come out looking the same, only neater.  I like a good sex scene as well as anyone, but somehow Ms. Neels stories don't seem to need them.Even the <BR>villian(ess) in this story wasn't with us for long. A nice, comfy read.	2002-10-29

There was no way of telling when they were written.  I liked the sister book-Tales of the Uncanny and Supernatural better. This volumne's tales were 'hit or miss'. I thought the pace on some of them were too slow, and on others as though I missed the point.

Not this one though. The back cover description makes it sound like Sam wants sex, what he wants is an explanation for the break-up, which he never got. Karen is running away from the death of her first love, a marine Gunnery Sergeant. So how believable is it that she would date, let alone love another one? Because that's what she whines about-'you're going to die, and I'm afraid' just about through the whole book. Sam deserves better. That's why it got 2 stars instead of one, cause I liked the hero-I just wish the author had given him a better book.	2002-10-28

Eloise was told about the handsome Dr. Timon van Zeilst.  &quot;But no one's caught him yet.&quot;  Eloise felt quite sure that it wouldn't be her. Why should he look twice at a plain English nurse with the beautiful Liske around? And Liske had claimed she was destined to be his wife.  It was no good telling herself not to care, because she did--even if he was the most infuriating man she'd ever met!<br />This was somewhat typical of Ms. Neels plots;  doctor, plain nurse, female villain and misunderstandings.  In this story however, there seemed to me to be a little more tension/edginess to the story than I usually get with Ms. Neels books.  I liked it, just can't put my finger on what was different.	2002-10-27

But how did we go from an unfortunate series of events that led to the sinking of an American cruise ship by either a Russian or American missile, to the rest of the story? The book attempts to find out whose missile actually hit the ship, then drops it. Why did the Americans all of a sudden want Pamela Drake to steal the crystal from the Russian laser, and for what reason? How improbable is it that Tomboy would be on the Russian ship, then ejecting from a Russian bomber with no further development. Then the President appears out of nowhere on the carrier to present Ms. Drake with a metal(book's spelling), for what??? Not a really coherent plot for the last third of the book.	2002-10-26

Marius van Houben, the boy's uncle, was rich, attractive and successful--and very single. He could have any girl he wanted.  What were the chances that he would want her?

Gretchen was not wild or crazy. She didn't even know any eligible men-except her tenant, Dr. Marco Garibaldi. A look from him made her toes curl.  Could she have an afffair with him? Well, she had promised...  Marco had made a promise, too.  Never marry.  A physician's life was too demanding.  But as his attraction to Gretchen grew, he couldn't resist her sweet seduction.  Their wild, crazy affair had begun. But it was suddenly interruped when Gretchen announced she was pregnant. And Marco amazed himself when he considered doing something he'd promised never to do-propose!<br />I started out liking this book, but towards the end I just wished both Gretchen and Marco would stop emoting and just get on with the business of living. The plot moved along, but towards the end it stalled.  It did have some interesting discussions about the choices we make, but the story could have moved along at a faster pace.	2002-10-25

Charming women was Texas oil baron Cal Langtry's specialty. But kids were a whole other matter.  So when the rugged wildcatter discovered he was a daddy, he turned to his ever-present assistant to help fine-tune his parenting skills.  Surely the prim and pretty Sabrina would never expect a lifetime commitment in return for her favors.  But when those favors changed from playing part-time helper to full-time lover, would Cal be able to stop himself from saying those three little words: &quot;Marry me, please&quot;?<br />The story was OK.  The daughter in the story is a surprise to Cal as he was never told about her.  The story moves along at a nice pace. As I was reading it though, I wondered what was going to happen when the daughter actually moved in with her dad and it's just the two of them.  The last quarter of the book felt as though Ms. Mallery couldn't make up her mind how she wanted the plot to develope and tried a few different twists before she made up her mind.	2002-10-25

For years, Lilah Forrest had dodged her matchmaking colonel father's 'bachelor bullets.' But that didn't stop him from steamrolling Sergeant Kevin Rogan into playing Lilah's personal escort.  She'd never marry military-not even sexy soldier Rogan.  But at the drill instructor's touch, her icy emotions did a swift about-face...and the virgin found herself unable to resist his masterful seduction.  Still, Lilah knew what she wanted in a man-and gruff and solitary wasn't it.  So why, after just one more night of loving, did she want to give this marine his marching orders...to meet her at the altar?<br />Nice story, good sexual tension, and funny dialogue between Lilah and Kevin.  The only quibble I had was the part where Kevin finds out she's a virgin and not really engaged.  I didn't feel it was that big a deal. It wasn't on the same level as what his ex-wife lied about.  This is the first book in this Marine series I've read, and I'm now looking for the others.	2002-10-21

It was the flowers she couldn't handle.  And after taking one too many antihistamines, the allergy-ridden bridesmaid found herself being carried off by dashing groomsman Sheik Rafik Haun.  Imagine her surprise when she woke up in the notorious bachelor's bed.  Honor kept Rafik from taking advantage of the drowsy beauty in his care.  But now desperation had him making an even bolder request-that she pose as his fiancee!  Only until he convinced his marriage-minded parents that he was better off a bachelor.  Or until the pretty Miss Seridan found her way into his hard heart...<br />It wasn't a bad story, just not very believable.  How many sheiks does the middle east have?  Are there any left over there?  The heroine was OK, the hero was marginal. That he didn't seem to realize that carrying a comatose woman through a hotel lobby wouldn't cause a problem was strange.  He also goes to work the next day and can't see pink shoes and a handbag on the car seat?  The story moves along and the sexual tension developes nicely.  I will try another of the author's books to see if this is typical of her style or not.	2002-10-21

His daughter Annie is quite possibly not his at all, thanks to his wife's perfidy.  But raising Annie still requires a governess, and Elinor Browning, a war widow with a small son, seems as qualified a candidate as any...until she insists on spreading her Christmas cheer through his home, that is.   Elinor's sunny optimism is only the first chink in the armor Lucas has developed.  The apperance of his dead father in the form of a ghost is another.  Either Lucas has lost his wits or his self-imposed prison--and it's effect on Annie --requires further soul-searching.  When serveral more opinionated ghosts join the fray, it's not long before he bares his soul to understanding Elinor--and realizes that her gentle love may be just the gift he's longed for this joyous Christmas.<br />The plot is a take off on Dicken's \\"A Christmas Carol\\".  Nice easy read, likable characters and a hero who slowly realizes what he has been missing.  The plot could have moved a little faster, but it was OK. If you like Christmas Regency stories, give this one a try.	2002-10-20

US	43086691	RDB36TQMMLUL8	0312978960	248247645	The Marriage Masquerade	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Too drawn out.	This is a story that starts out OK, but fizzles. I liked the characters, but they never stopped talking. There was no tension, or suspense--once the plot moved from the U.S. to England the villians were obvious.  I found myself skipping pages to get to some action.  There is some humor, but not enough.  Also, the ending seemed a little rushed and contrived.	2002-10-17

Fleeing a forced marriage in Scotland, she arrives on the doorstep of Rutleigh Hall seeking shelter as a distant relation, only to find that Knight Dennison, the Viscount Rutleigh, may be worse than the man she fled.  True to his dangerous reputation, Knight threatens to toss the penniless, flame-haired impostor out-until she produces the family ring as proof of her identity. Thrust into the role of guardian, the dark, compelling Knight has his doubts about the lovely Scottish lass, who's clearly keeping secrets-but her wit, beauty, and artless grace are hard to resist.  When his sister starts husband-hunting for Catriona, the idea of any other man possessing her is suddenly unthinkable.  For Knight realizes that there's only one possible groom for her: himself.<br />This description of the plot doesn't do justice to the story.  What a terrific bunch of characters-from the nobles to the servants, famliy members and friends, you'll like them all.  Catriona has the 'sight', but so does the housekeeper.  This is a friendly, happy book.  I found myself smiling as I read various parts, mostly between Catriona and Knight.  What a nice hero, and when he realizes he loves her, he becomes playful.  Even the villians are nice. I hope the author does two more books, one about the brother, James and another about Lamont.	2002-10-15

This is a nice mix of supernatural, and scary stories that make you uneasy. If you like stories with a subdued menace try to find this book, you'll enjoy it. You will have to take your time, the author slowly builds up the suspense in each tale.	2002-10-14
US	43086691	R30YEG31N24SD8	0263148556	473646322	The Trophy Husband	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Interesting	Here's the description from the back cover--The personal assistant: When Sara caught her fiance being unfaithful with her cousin, she felt doubly betrayed.  Her Boss: Almost miraculously, Alex Rosini was on hand to help Sara pick up the pieces.  However having worked for Alex for some time now, she knew he never did anything without expecting something in return.  So why was she surprised when he revealed that he was prepared to pay the cost of having her-be it money or marriage.  Business or pleasure?  Sara wanted Alex so badly,  she would have given herself to him with no strings attached.  But in order to win Alex, she would have to play his game--and choose her price---.  OK, I gave this 4 stars because I like L. Graham's stories.  Yes, most of the time her heros are a little  cruel, but they always wind up vulnerable in the end.  This hero is not cruel as much as he is not comfortable when he is not in control.  The heroine is wary at first, then as the story moves along she figures out that she has to fight for his understanding.  One of the reasons I like this hero is that he is trying to understand how to reach Sara.	2002-10-12

There is a nice copyright page in the back of the book.  The print is nicely done too.  This book has 14 stories.  They are: Fergus O'Hara, Dectective; Chip; Opportunity; A Craving for Originality; One of Those Cases (A \\"Nameless Detective\\" Story); I Didn't Do It; Quicker Than the Eye (with Michael Kurland); Angel of Mercy; Connoisseur; Mrs. Rakubian; Smuggler's Island; A Taste of Paradise; Under the Skin; Prose Bowl (with Barry Malzberg).  I did not like the Prose Bowl or Craving for Originality stories.  The rest were a good mix of stories set from the Civil War to the future.  I haven't read any of these in any other anthology so far and that's a first for me.	2002-10-12
US	43086691	R1NAB5DEIMYAEN	0373291752	572264020	Shotgun Grooms	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Pleasantly surprised	There are two stories in this book: one by Susan Mallery--Lucaas's Convenient Bride, and the second by Maureen Child--Jackson's Mail-Order Bride.  The men are Lucas MacIntyre and his brother, Jackson MacIntyre. Their uncle died and left a will stating that they couldn't inherit the saloon/ranch/mine unless they married.  The women in both stories are strong, caring, and focused.  They are different in that one is plain and one isn't,  but they are willing to take a risk on these two guys, and work at it. I was really surprised how much I liked this book.  I started it, and didn't put it down till I read the whole thing.  Try it.	2002-10-10

The plot is familiar, the male lead, like all of hers, is as close to an emotional abuser as you can get.  So, why do I read this stuff?  Maybe because in the end he gets walloped in the heart and repents? Or maybe I hope Ms. Palmer will someday make the hero strong and pleasant.  This story could have gone 3 different ways, and at one point I thought it would.  However she uses a plot device she has used before-heroine gets in an accident and the hero wakes up to the fact that he could have lost his love.  Very little sex and that also with overtones of he wants it, he gets it.  And, yes I'll probably buy her next book too, I live in hope!	2002-10-08

Chesterton, William Bunce, Frances Usher, Ruth Rendell, Edward D. Hoch, Sherita Saffer Campbell, Eudora Welty, Frances & Richard Lockridge, Lord Dunsany, K.D. Wentworth, Dan Crawford, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Dorothy B. Davis, Wyc Toole and Lawrence Treat. The copyright on this book is 1996.  The one story I did not like was the one by N. Hawthorne.  I read a lot of anthologies so there were 2 stories here that I read somewhere else, the Christie & Slesar ones. All the rest were new to me and interesting in the way the theme of the garden was used.  I always thought gardens were supposed to be theraputic, but in these stories there is always a menace/threat hovering in the air.  If you enjoy mystery short stories, try this one.	2002-10-08

Half Scot, half English, she could claim no place as home--until the Lord of Bitterlee, as gallant a knight as any could dream, came in search of a bride.  Marriage had been naught but sadness for Adam Sutton, yet duty demanded he wed again.  Cristiane MacDhiubh, as fey and wild as his own island fiefdom, might rouse his forgetten passions.  But brave of heart though she might be, could Cristiane ever heal his sorrowing soul? It is an OK story, nothing to rave about, but a quick way to pass the time if you have nothing else to read.  The plot is one we have all read before, but the characters are nicely done.  The author did fool me though, I thought the plot was going to be more violent than it was.  Not bad, try it.	2002-10-05

The book is too long at 418 pages.  About page 234 I had enough.  The villian beats up Alienore (French for Eleanor?), again, threatens to tell Colin, again, and she folds up, again.  Meanwhile you have spent the last 200 pages reading about how he is teaching Alienore how to fight.  Also, by this time she should know Colin would never hurt her no matter what has been said. Colin's character seemed to be a lot sharper in Gillian and Christopher's story, here he is a little dim.  What's so amusing about pages of Colin and Alienore fighting/teaching in the mud? I finally skipped about 50 pages of \\"will he slice my head off or won't he\\", finished it last night and sit here really annoyed about this book. There is no sexual tension in this story. The courting part was rushed, and the story drags on at the end. If, like me, you wanted to read Colin's story, get it from the library, don't buy it.	2002-10-04

After reading fantasy for years, the plots get that old feeling.  What a joy to read this story.  The plot is described in the editorial reviews, so I won't go over it again, but this book was refreshing. A hero you feel for, bunch of sidekicks who are for the most part normal and magic underneath everything. Stayed up all night to finish it and I haven't done that in a long while. The story never drags, the characters are well developed--in that you care what happens to them--all in all a good read.	2002-10-02

I liked the two main characters, but the plot went off in tangents all over the place.  I also didn't like the sister (Jamie).  The ending felt like it was rushed, and to make it worse, the author takes the hero's friend and gives (marries) him off to the sister.  He deserves better.  I was hoping Ms. Thomas would give him his own story, but maybe it's for the best, I'd hate to be disappointed twice.	2002-09-21

They range over a broad time period, early to present.  I like the fact that there were some authors I haven't read yet, or others that I never associated with mysteries.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is that there were quite a few stories that I had already read in other anthologies. Nice introductions to each story, with background info on the author.	2002-09-20

Yes, you can see the plot coming a mile away and yes the heroine is good with kids, but I like this book. Characters you like, a female with spirit and a hero who learns what is important.  The story doesn't bog down, it keeps moving at a good pace, and there are some laughs.  Hope she writes another one soon.	2002-09-13

Yes, I am being sarcastic.  The plot and characters are boring.  So is the sex.  There is suppossed to be a plot, not just sex -anywhere, anytime, anyhow. About the only nice thing I can say about this book is it is not as bad as On A Wicked Night.  That's because the lead characters are boring, not hateful.	2002-05-15

That being said the reason I wasn't crazy about this one is that this story has been written before, by other authors, and no I don't remember who at this exact moment, but the plot is predictable, the characters standard, and it's not much of a mystery.  It's not one of those books you can't put down, more like-I guess I have to finish this so I can pass it on.	2002-05-15

The Bar Cynster series has had its mix of good and bad, but at least you could sort of go along with the plot.  Maybe I was expecting another hero like Chillingworth, not in this book.  Yes Martin, (the hero) is big, strong, handsome, etc. but what a wimp.  He has a murder hanging over his head for 10 years and does nothing about it!  Amanda does all the running here.  She is annoying, really.  Not what I thought she would be like.  She decides to go to the places in the ton where she will find someone like her cousins, not at the balls-at the gaming hells etc. Even if you go along with this, no one tells her male cousins she's there? You know the Bar Cynster guys have enemies and rivals that would love to let them know she's fooling around. This story wasn't even remotely believable. Oh, the sex--just about in every chapter--boring.  I like to see sex in these stories, but as part of the plot, not instead of it.  The best part of the book was on page 280 when Martin's cousin tells Amanda off.  Way to go!  What it really boils down to is that I wanted to like this book, tried and just couldn't. At a [money]cover price I feel cheated.	2002-04-08

That being said, it's an OK story.  The other reviewers can give you a basic plot summary. As I wrote in my Devil's Deliliah review, my reason for reading this book is because I like her newer books, and want to see how her earlier stories match up.  Lord of Scoundrels, Last Hellion and Captives of the Night, in that order, are the ones I like best. Didn't like Lion's Daughter.	2002-02-21

She is trying to get married and her father is an\\"infamous rake\\".  Delilah is trying to stop the publication of the book till after she is married. The story starts out entertaining but gets bogged down about two-thirds through. OK, why would you read this book, let alone buy it?  The same reason I did--you like this author and want to read her earlier stuff.   As you read it you can she how the author is developing the style she uses later in her other books. <BR>There's no sex other than kissing and some fondling. I like Lord of Scoundrels, the Last Hellion, and Captives of the Night in that order, I didn't like Lion's Daughter.  Hope this helps.	2002-02-19

Mr. Haining has done a good job of collecting stories from the 1800's to 1960 that have been made into horror films.  This book should really appeal to horror film buffs/students. Quite a few of the stories have appeared in other anthologies--because I read some of them in either author anthologies (Poe, Lovecraft, Bradbury) or horror anthologies.  Here is a list of the authors: Francis O Mann, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Gaston Leroux, Somerset Maugham, Tod Robbins, Richard Connell, Bram Stoker (not Dracula),Stephen V Benet, Robert L. Stevenson, W.F. Harvey, Ray Bradbury, George Langelaan, Nikolai Gogol, Ambrose Bierce, H.P. Lovecraft and Robert Bloch.  I have seen some of the movies made from these stories.

The varied and sometimes muddled storylines all came together in this book.  Plots that were confusing became clear.  Richard was dealt with. Anita comes to term with what she is.  Jean-Claude's character is developed in greater depth.  Some of the other reviews mention the sex(a lot)but all the other books lead up to it. It's not easy to explain why I didn't find the sex objectionable, but it just went with the story and the characters.  Also, I found the toned down blood, guts, gore, torture, mayhem and murder to be a nice change of pace.	2002-01-11
