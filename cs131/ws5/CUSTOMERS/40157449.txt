In April 2001 the book group I belong to read Savage's \\"The Kid (What Happened After my Boyfriend and I Decided to Go Get Pregnant): An Adoption Story,\\"  and we haven't shut up about it since.  Thus, I was really jazzed to read this new book about the pressures being brought to bear on Savage and his longtime companion Terry to tie-the-knot.  He has an uncanny ability to communicate all of the various emotions that he and Terry experience as they go through the process of deciding if marriage is right for them, as well as those of their six year-old son and Savage's surprisingly supportive Catholic mother.<br /><br />Savage is, above all, a very talented, very funny writer. Known for his blistering attacks on the Radical Right, this book features a generous amount of acerbic comments and oberservations.  The majority of Savage's vitriol is reserved for the absurd rationales the Right uses to bully and marginalize gays and lesbians and our relationships.  He calls attention to the hypocrisy of people such as Rush Limbaugh, who has been married four times, yet has the unmitigated temerity to claim that gays are incapable of monogamous, long-term relationships.<br /><br />Just as he did in \\"The Kid,\\"  Savage has managed to put a very human face on these very real, very gay people.  He has created a book with a genuine universal appeal that manages to perfectly illustrate why same-sex couples deserve equal status under the law.  A whole slew of books on this topic have been published in recnt years, and though the only one I've read is Andrew Sullivan's \\"Same-Sex Marriage Pro & Con: A Reader,\\" I can't imagine that any of the others are as personal, poignant, hilarious or accessible as this book.	2005-09-28

If it's classy, literary novels like \\"The English Patient\\" and \\"The Remains of the Day\\" you fancy, than this little gem will leave you well satisfied.<br /><br />This is a novel of Sherlock Holmes.  However, this is not a mystery.  The year is 1946, and Holmes is more than 90 years old.  He lives quietly on a country estate, seeing almost no one, save for his housekeeper and her adolescent son.<br /><br />The author has expertly crafted a multilayered novel taking place in three distinct time frames: the distant past filled, with memories of unrequited love; the recent past, and a visit to war ravaged Japan (the guest of a homosexual couple); and the unexpectly tragic present.<br /><br />Surprisingly emotional, full of vivid, heartfelt prose, \\"A Slight Trick of the Mind\\" is an unexpected treat.	2005-09-05

When you mix in the current trend of publishing humorous memoirs by gay authors you'll understand why \\"Breakfast with Tiffany: An Uncle's Memoir,\\" by Edwin John Wintle, is getting such a big publicity push from publisher Miramax (who has optioned the book for a film).<br /><br />The author/protagonist is a single successful gay man living in NYC who takes on the guardianship of his precocious thirteen year-old niece.  Personally, this scenario is one of my recurring nightmares.  Be that as it may, this is an engaging, heartfelt memoir, and though not exactly \\"Auntie Mame,\\" the author effectively utilizes broad \\"gay\\" humor and outrageous anecdotes to communicate his story.  Though the writing lacks the sardonic brilliance of Dan Savage's adoption epic \\"The Kid,\\" or the life and death emotionalism of B. D. Wong's \\"Following Foo,\\" all three tell stories of gay parenting that adroitly illustrate a deep seated need of many in our community to establish \\"traditional\\" families of their own.<br /><br />Now I've always been of the opinion that children smell bad, and are often loud, cruel and obnoxious.  Thus, I thought I'd find it hard to relate to this story.  However, the need to love and be loved in return is universal, and our hero's desire to nurture and mentor his troubled, often self-absorbed ward, does play out as admirable and provides ample rewards for the reader.  In the end this is a courageous and inspiring \\"Uncle Knows Best\\" story of unconditional love and self-sacrifice.  Well done.	2005-07-30

Set in the 1980's, \\"The Line of Beauty\\" is a brilliant comedy of manners played out at the height of Thatcher's reign of conservatism.<br /><br />Written in a style of Henry James - the novel's protagonist is writing a thesis on James and also a screenplay of his novel \\"The Spoils of Poynton\\" - Hollinghurst tells a story of money, greed, betrayal, sex and politics, where class distinctions are blurred, morals corrupted and AIDS is an equal opportunity killer.  The one novel which came to my mind while reading this was not written by James, but rather by Edith Wharton - \\"The House of Mirth.\\"  Our hero finds himself in the same situation as Wharton's Lily Bart.  Living among the rich and powerful is drastically different from being one of them.  Simply, one most be careful when swimming with sharks.  Sharks are known to eat their own - they won't hesitate to eat you.  Our hero's naivete is his undoing.<br /><br />Filled with knowing observations of the times and their politics, \\"The Line of Beauty\\" is a great work of social commentary, with Hollinghurst writing at the top of his game.  Lover's of fine literature, with a decidedly gay bent, will cherish this brave new novel from the author of the classic \\"The Swimming Pool Library.\\"	2005-06-28

Considering that July 2005 marks the 150th anniversary of the publication of Walt Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass,\\" it is only fitting that Michael Cunningham's impressive new novel \\"Specimen Days\\" celebrates the work of Whitman.<br /><br />Set in New York City, \\"Specimen Days\\" is a marvel of construction and execution.  The plots compliment each other with recurring character names and reference to places and objects, while utilizing Whitman's poetry as a unifying motif.  With skill and insight Cunningham has captured three separate genres - a ghost story set in the 1880's, a modern day story of suspense, and an allegorical science fiction tale set 150 years in the future.  Along the way there are passages of great beauty.  Indeed, the scene where a disfigured boy encounters Whitman on a Manhattan street is one of the most rapturous in contemporary literature.  This is truly bravura writing.<br /><br />It is difficult for an artist to follow a work generally regarded as a masterpiece, and though this work does feature three connected stories in in different time periods, that is where all comparisons with \\"The Hours\\" should begin and end.  \\"Specimen Days\\" may not prove to be a masterwork, but it is an inspired and rewarding piece of fiction, and deserves to be appreciated for its own virtues which are many.	2005-06-14

July 4 is the 150th anniversary of the publication of Walt Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass.\\"  This volume, if not the single greatest achievement in American letters, is certainly one of them.  When I first read \\"Leaves of Grass\\" I felt jolted, as if great, loving hands had grabbed me and shaken me into consciousness.  I felt live.  I'd never read anything remotely like it.  Until that moment, I had no idea that simple, everydays words, could be used to such ebullient effect.  Since its publictaion it has come to be thought of as an almost holy text.  Indeed, there is something almost Christ-like in the love of nature and humanity that Whitman conveys.  Even through the bloody civil war and the assassination of our beloved President Lincoln, Whitman was able to find life affirming beauty and hope.  That this was composed by an openly gay man edifies all gay people.	2005-06-14

Auden, Carson McCullers, Jane and Paul Bowles, Benjamin Britten, and Gypsy Rose Lee, Under One Roof In Wartime America	Books	5	34	34	N	Y	A Marvelous trip down memory lane or, rather, Middagh Street	7 Middagh Street literally doesn't exist any longer.  It was torn down to make way for an Expressway.  During the last decade of his life the poet Frank O'Hara lived in four different apartments in Manhattan and at least one of them has a commemorative plague.  If 7 Middagh Street were still standing the entire building would have to be bronzed.  George Davis, the fiction editior for \\"Harper's Bizaar,\\" rented and renovated the house with the assistance of friends W. H. Auden and Carson McCullers.  Together they sought to create a kind of year round Yaddo - a boarding house for artists.  They were joined by Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears, Jane and Paul Bowles, Gypsy Rose Lee, Oliver Smith and Klaus Mann (among others).  This is their story.  As you can imagine, life at 7 Middagh Street was anything but boring.<br /><br />This is the kind of biographical history I most enjoy reading.  It focuses on a very specific period of time, communicating brilliantly the personal and professional triumphs and failures, as well as the ravaging effects of current world events these artists were dealing with while living together.  It provides just the right balance of background material on each resident without ever becoming bogged down in trivial details that interrupt the natural progression of the story.  Yes, there is a certain amount of \\"dirt.\\" The spats between Auden and Paul Bowles are well documented, and the endless parade of sailors, the parties that lasted until dawn, the battling McCullers. Most of the residents, even those who were married, were either homosexual or bisexual.  The book, and this history, is simply fascinating. If you care at all about 20th century art - literature and music especially - this is a book you shouldn't miss.	2005-06-06

They gather at his grandmother's seaside home with two of his gay friends.  What I especially liked about this novel was that it was never predictable.  Just when you thought you had it all figured out the author would take you in an alternate direction.  I also liked the fact that the obvious was never overstated.  None of these characters is without sin.  They have been judgmental and unforgiving and each has made mistakes that have been blown out of all proportion.  Is there reconciliation?  Is everything wrapped up neat and pretty at the end of the book?  Yes and no.  You feel that progress has been made.  Beacuse certain things have gone either unsaid or unresolved, I feel like these characters are still alive out there struggling to understand one another and maybe forgive if not absolve one another.

Alan Hollinghurst's \\"The Swimming-Pool Library\\" is considered a classic of gay literature (and justly so).

An aimless young man (rich and beautiful) leads a life of leisure, replete with hedonistic sexual encounters.  Looking for sex in a public restroom, the young man encounters eighty-something Lord Nantwich, who proceeds to have a heart attack.  Our hero performs CPR, saves the old gents life, and a friendship ensues.  The Lord enlists the young man to write his life story - which as it turns out has been a very interesting life.  Lots of other things happen as this relationship developes.  Does the biography get written?  Well, that's the story, and I'm not going to give anything else away.  This is a work of empowering literature.  Hollinghhurst is a brilliant writer.  Don't miss this beautifully realized book.	2005-03-19

In 1952 Patricia Highsmith composed this personal and revelatory classic.  Harper & Bros, publisher of Highsmith's \\"Strangers on a Train,\\" refused to issue this novel due to its controversial subject matter.  The powers that be convinced Highmsith that publishing under her own name would adversely impact her career the way Gore Vidal's had initially been by \\"The City and the Pillar.\\"  The Naiad Press out of Tallahassee, Florida published this volume under the pseudonym Claire Morgan.  Ironically, \\"The Price of Salt\\" became one of this author's best sellers.  All that seems so long ago - another lifetime.  Indeed, it's hard to conceive of Michael Cunningham or Tony Kushner having to contend with such issues.  So, now that all of the controversy has abated we can judge this novel on it's own merits, and the verdict is a happy one.  \\"The Price of Salt\\" is one of Highsmith's best efforts.  This novel works on a number of levels.  It is both a \\"coming out\\" story and a \\"love\\" story, with a bit of the author's trademark suspense thrown in for good measure.  The story has an emotional honesty and autobigraphical sensibility; qaulities that are noticeably absent from much of her other work.  I found myself pulling for Carol and Therese, and found the development of their relationship to be natural and true to life.  The \\"happy ending\\" is achieved in an uncompromising fashion that doesn't feel false or contrived.  I am reminded of a Stephen Sondheim lyric: \\"wishes come true, not free.\\"  These characters paid a price for their happiness - it wasn't free.	2005-02-07

As a rule, I'm not a big fan of novels that ramble.  \\"Flesh and Blood\\" is a ramble.  However, I was totally enthralled from start to finish.  This is the story of the Stassos family.  It begins in 1939 and ends in the present day.  This is the most intimate portrait of a family I've ever read.  Each of the characters is fully realized, drawn with a clarity that insists on presenting each as unique and individual.  Each possess the basic ambiguities of characte and personality that define us as human beings.  No one is without flaw.  No one is always right or always wrong.  Families love and hate, exhilarate and exasperate, praise and disparage in equal measure.  There is joy and there is sorrow.  I felt transported as I read this novel.  It is one of the best that I have ever read.  I couldn't stand setting it down, and couldn't wait to get back to it when I had.  What better recommendation for a novel but that it was so involving I felt I was a silent character with a vested interest in the everyday existence of this truly American family?  Michael Cunningham, author of \\"The Hours\\" and \\"A Home At the End of the World,\\" is a modern master.  READ THIS BOOK.	2005-01-24

I was reading about this book in \\"Too Brief a Treat: The Letters of Truman Capote.\\"  In a June 14, 1950 letter to Goyen, Capote wrote: \\"I feel, not unaccountably, as though I'd had a nearly religious experience.  Dear God, Bill, I wept, trembled, and as I turned the final page I might have frozen from the chill along my spine.  It is a novel of unearthly beauty!....\\"  Well, based on these and a few other comments I ordered the book.<br /><br />This truly is like no other book I've ever read.  It is a wonderfully articulated prose novel.  This is the story of a house and the family that once lived there.  Each member of the family gives an accounting of events and secrets and feelings. The story Berryben tells is especially moving - \\"All I know is that there was a change in me and, discovering that change in me, I would do anything to keep it unchanged, I would not let it die in me.\\"  The story of Christy and Otey is heartbreaking.<br /><br />This isn't an easy book to read.  The story isn't told in a linear fashion.  It's full of long, languorous passages of incredible beauty.  I was reminded at times of both Virginia Woolf and Capote.

There is no denying that Patricia Highmsith was one of the great suspence writers of the past century.  However, not everything that glitters is gold.<br /><br />The easiest way to describe Highsmith's final novel \\"Small g: A Summer Idyll\\" is to say it's a 150 page story trapped in a 300 page book.  Having said that, I must admit that this novel is not without virtues: actually, the story is quite strong, the characters are an endearing assortment of straights and gays tangled up in a pseudo-mystery, the scenario is not uninteresting (it could make a first rate film - Rupert Everett would be great as Ricky) - which is why I pushed myself to finish.

These artists included Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot and Andre Gide, among others.  She expounds upon her experiences as James Joyce's publisher and benefactress to a considerable depth, while never overtly acknowledging the intimate nature of her relationship with Adrienne Monnier.

Biographers should learn that just because something's a fact doesn't make it interesting.  Having said that, this book isn't without its virtues.  I found the passages dealing with his interaction with artists and co-workers informative.  It was very interesting to discover that O'Hara's college roommate was Edward Gorey - what an odd couple.  Also, the details of O'Hara serving as Cecil Beaton's secretary were enjoyable.  I did learn some things about O'Hara's sexual adventures that made me cringe (having lived through the plague years my view is compromised).  Mr. Gooch has written a book full of facts and trivia - it's certainly a worthwhile chronicle of O'Hara's life.  If you're looking for a more intimate portrait I recommend \\"Digression On Some Poems By Frank O'Hara,\\" for a more academic look at his work look for \\"Poet Among Painters.\\"	2004-08-16

I don't know why it surprises me to discover that Hollywood has tampered with a novel.  Having only seen the Hitchcock film scripted by Raymond Chandler, I was blown away by this early classic from Highsmith.  Pretty much the first third of the novel has ended up on screen, but it would seem that Hitch and his associates simply didn't read the rest.  Almost everything about this story has been changed.  I like the story as Highsmith wrote it.  She is a master of suspence.  The characters are well drawn and full of ambiguity.  Like most everything else I've read by Highsmith, this is both gripping and unnerving.  I loved it.	2004-07-10

How can I possibly communicate what these poems mean to me?  \\"Renascence\\" alone takes my breath away - \\"The soul can split the sky in two, And let the face of God shine through.\\"  These words too, allow the divine to shine through.  \\"Interim\\" is, perhaps, as beutiful a poem as I have ever read.  The author brilliantly captures the essence of loss, that grief and confusion, the mind's inability to accept the notion of a life alone: \\"...part of your heart aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled in the damp earth with you.  I have been torn in two, and suffer for the rest of me...\\"  There are still so many other passages that leap off these pages.  Her phrases are like literary gem stones: Sonnet XXVII: \\"I know I am but summer to your heart, And not the full four seasons of the year\\" - could it be said any more succinctly?  This collection is a must for anyone who cares at all about poetry - American or otherwise.	2004-06-28

That those words could be said in reference to anything written by Truman Capote is a crime.  I had to order this used (which I don't mind in the least - these books often have a character all their own), and was immediately capitvated by the &quot;voice&quot; of this singular artist.  These essays are rich in the flavor of people, places and cultures encountered by Capote, whose luminous prose styling is everywhere in eveidence.  I am continually awed by the the talent of the this writer.  Over the past few months I've read almost everything in the canon and have never been less than thrilled by this author's use of language and imagery.  It's time to get this book back in print.  Vintage International publishes a beautiful paperback combining the novella &quot;The Grass Harp&quot; with &quot;A Tree of Night and Other Stories&quot; - why not publish these wonderful essays in a single volume with &quot;The Muses Are Heard&quot;?

His writing talent was prodigious, but nothing compared to his talent for self-promotion.  He was a true master of the short form, producing a series of award winning short stories -\\"The Headless Hawk,\\" \\"Miriam,\\" \\"Children on Their Birthdays, \\"Shut a Final Door,\\" the novels \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\" and \\"The Grass Harp,\\" with all of his talents finally coalescing with the brilliant \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\\"  He wrote the film scripts of \\"Beat the Devil\\" and \\"The Innocents,\\" and the musical \\"House of Flowers.\\"  He adapted his great short story \\"A Christmas Memory\\" for television and won an Emmy Award.  1966 brought his masterpiece - \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  His achievements were justly celebrated.  Then came the famous Black and White Ball - and when the party was over, it was truly over.  Want to know what happened?  Read this wickedly funny book.  It's an honest portrait of a shining literary star who  simply burned himself out.  My hat goes off to the late, great George Plimpton.	2004-04-20

His plays, especially \\"Entertaining Mr. Sloan,\\" \\"Loot\\" and \\"What the Butler Saw\\" are considered classics of the blackest form of comedy.  He enjoyed shocking people, while always maintaining that his characters and the situations he places them in were grounded in reality.<br />This is a theatrical bio as bold and brash as its subject.  Lahr has done a thorough job of exposing this most controversial of playwrights.  Joe was a sexual compulsive, an in-your-face homosexual who enjoyed sex with strangers in public places.  He also loved to brag about his exploits, never skimping on a detail.<br />Just when \\"things\\" were finally coming together for Orton professionally, things were beginning to unravel for his companion Kenneth Halliwell, who brutally murdered Orton in August 1967.  Some would say his rude death befit how he lived the rest of his life. I think that would be judging Joe too harshly.  Perhaps he would have been a flash-in-the-pan or as lasting and popular as Stoppard. We'll never know.  That's the tragedy.  Good job Lahr.	2004-04-19

His style is so simple, so conversational, that you often times are surprised by the sudden depth of feeling comminicated in a final phrase.  I don't know enough about poetry to prattle on and on without betraying my ignornace in short order.  However, I know what I like, I know what speaks to me.

Joe LeSueur's memoir of his friend and companion, is a truly illuminating portrait of the artist.  What makes these digressions so rich and rewarding for the reader, is the unique perspective LeSueur is able to bring to this material.  These are LeSueur's memories of experiences and events shared with O'Hara and their myriad of friends and acquaintances.  I found this book to be compelling, intimate and inspiring (indeed, &quot;Lunch Poems&quot; and &quot;Selected Poems&quot; were never too far out of reach, and both read from cover to cover).  By virtue of having been a participant or, at the very least having been an eye witness to the events depicted, LeSueur has captured not just a time and place, but the essence of a cherished friend.  I found myself reading slowly, savoring each passage.  By the end of the book I felt I had really gotten to know O'Hara and his circle of friends, and found myself in tears as I read the last few pages.  LeSueur's memoir is a tribute to Frank O'Hara as both an artist and a beloved friend.	2004-04-11

Doug Wright has crafted a play that is intelligent, illuminating and very \\"theatrical\\" (which I love).  I was very fortunate to see the Broadway production at the Lyceum Theatre and was blown away.  Like \\"Angels in America,\\" reading this play (which I strongly recommend you do) doesn't compare with seeing it performed.  Jeffrey Mays gave a brilliant performance (one of the finest I've ever seen - as good as Julie Harris in \\"The Belle of Amhearst\\" - and there ain't no higher praise than that!).  The direction of Moises Kaufman was perfect, as were all of the technical elements.  I would certainly hope to see this play collect the majority of this seasons prizes - Tony Award nominations for Best Play, Best Direction and Best Actor  seem certain.  It has my vote for all three.	2004-03-08

The guys often kid me about being the facilitator, steering committee and publicity chairman (I piece together a monthly newsletter).  Our goal has been to discover our gay roots - our hidden history.  Throughout the past four years primarily (though obviously I've been reading all along), I have read a great deal of fiction, poetry, biography and history written by and/or about gay people.  Perhaps because of my own trek through gay literature, I found Rick Whitaker's book enthralling.  His observations are keen.  His choice of writers and individual works are fresh and his writing is accessible.  You don't have to be familiar with each of the writers discussed to appreciate Whitaker's take on their work.  The fact that I have read, or at least heard of most of, the material discussed here only increased my appreciation for this truly remarkable little book.  God bless you Rick for drawing our attention to James Purdy and Jane Bowles and Frank O'Hara and Glenway Wescott.  Perhaps your book will inspire your readers to seek out books by these authors.  Well done.	2004-02-01

Hmmmmmmm.  I didn't get it.  I felt that the basic plot premise was rather tragic.  Sure it had a \\"happy\\" ending and there were a number of funny quips.  However, this book is not \\"a laugh riot\\" - I never had one burst of uncontrolled laughter (as I have many times when reading books by Augusten Burroughs, David Sedaris and Dan Savage).  I felt that the characters were contrived and the situation seemed forced.  The physical writing is rather simplistic - there are no flurishes of great prose styling.  The tough guy is gay and the artistic guy is straight.  Alright, I can accept that.  Why then does the author burden the straight guy with numerous gay stereo types like cleaning his apartment while listening to his original cast album of \\"Candide?\\"  \\"Me thinks the lady duth protest too much.\\"  Alright, straight guys can love musicals too.  All I'm saying is that it just didn't ring true for me.  I wanted to laugh a lot more.  I didn't hate this novel, but I didn't love it either.  I expected more based on the reviews of other readers.  Oh, well.	2004-01-08

Yet, for a brief period of time, it was home to Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, Peter Orlovsky, Brian Gysin, and was infamously known as The Beat Hotel.<br />&quot;The Beat Hotel&quot; serves as an extended biographical sketch, presenting detailed glimpses into the histories of these artists - Burroughs' accidental shooting of his wife, his intense love affair with Ian Sommerville, Ginsberg's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother, the &quot;Howl&quot; obscenity trials, his affairs with Burroughs, Kerouac and Orlavsky.<br />What results is an often frank, always engaging depiction of the drugged out, free-loving world that produced such classic as Burroughs' &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; and Ginsberg's &quot;Kaddish.&quot;<br />It's to the author's credit that he achieves and exceeds his goal of increasing the reader's appreciation of these often neglected rebel artists.	2003-12-31

These stories are usually tragic or grotesque, told in a languid, poetical style that perfectly evokes the damp and sultriness of the Deep South - the heat and rot are characters as palpable and tangible as their human counterparts.<br />&quot;Why We Never Danced the Charleston&quot; and &quot;What the Dead Remember&quot; by Harlan Greene are perfect recent examples of this genre - and expand on themes and styles developed by writers such as Flannery O'Connor and James Purdy.<br />&quot;What the Dead Remember&quot; is a feast for the reader - so much more than a simple coming-of-age story or an AIDS-story.  It is multilayered.  Where the author succeeds most profoundly, is in the articulation of feelings, which are beautifully realized.  I can't recall reading a novel where I recognized as many feelings and situations so close to my own experience.  This one should not be overlooked.	2003-12-06

This is an angry, often confrontational, novel dealing with the psychological ramifications wrought by religious condemnation, gross hypocrisy and clergy that myopically perverts scripture by preaching hate and intolerance.<br />The story is communicated through a series of recollections.  Reality and memory coalesce in a nightmarish, drug-induced psychosis. \\"A Visitation of Spirits\\" is a haunting novel of a young gay man wrestling with his demons.  His struggles are universal; his solution is, unfortunately, both tragic and final.  This is a work of incredible depth,passion and understanding.<br />Randall Kenen, who won a Lambda Award for his short story collection \\"Let the Dead Bury Thier Dead,\\" is an enormously talented prose stylist.  He brings together the best qualities of James Baldwin, Carson McCullers, Toni Morrison and Flannery O'Connor.  Higher praise could not be offered.	2003-12-06

An espouser of Gandhian non-violence and a mentor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Rustin was a man of fierce convictions, openly gay in a time when to be so jeopardized even his basic freedoms.<br />D'Emilio records Rustin's life warts and all.  He documents his numerous arrests for acts of civil disobedience, for being a conscientious objector, as well as on a morals charge.<br />However, it is the triumphs that are most exhilerating to read about.  The March on Washington, as one would expect, is a highlight.  Finally, and definitively, the credit for coordinating this event is attributed to Rustin.  In the face of extreme opposition from the likes of Strom Thurmond and J. Edgar Hoover, Rustin staged an event of epic porportion and historic significance.<br />Rustin was one of the great unsung heroes of the last century.  John D'Emilio's biography, with a cast of characters that reads like a who's who of the twentieth century, is a tribute to Rustin and a model of its kind.	2003-12-06

The writing is luminous.  The characters are rich and dynamic.  There is humor, and wit, and pain, and pathos.  Perhaps Albee is just too smart for the average theatre goer.

In the case of Gore Vidal's gay-lit classic \\"The City and the Pillar\\" (which is being reissued this December by Vintage International), these phrases seem like understatements.<br /><br />Reading this novel again after more then twenty years, I was moved by the clarity and brevity of the prose.  Vidal doesn't mince words, but rather cuts to the heart of the matter - Jim Willard is in love with Bob Ford.  What bigns as simple boyhood buggery, develops into an all consuming passion, sadly unrequited and ultimately tragic.<br />By tackling a subject considered taboo, Vidal exposed various aspects of the homosexual psyche and the underground gay community as they existed in the 1940s.  Readers will note the influence this once shocking work has had on a number of contemporary writers.  Vidal remains both a maverick and literary hero.	2003-08-17

When this volume was first released it generated the kind of buzz usually reserved for acknowledged literary lions like John Updike and Joyce Carol Oates and was short-listed for the Pulitzer Prize.  So, was the hype warranted?  Yes and no.  Each of the stories is well crafted.  However, taken together they seem somehow to suffer from their thematic commonalities (much in the same way David Leavitt's \\"Family Dancing\\" did).  Haslett's themes are loss, isolation, mental illness and loneliness.  Of the nine stories collected here my favorites were: \\"The Beginnings of Grief\\" about a teen-age orphan who instigates a sexually abusive relationship with a schoolyard bully in an effort to anesthetize his feelings of loss and abandonment; \\"The Good Doctor\\" tells, with heart wrenching clarity, of a mother's grief and guilt over the loss of an unreachable drug addicted son;  \\"War's End\\" finds a clincally depressed, suicidal man making what may be a final connection with a dying boy; \\"Reunion\\" focuses on a young man's self-imposed isolation as he is slowy ravaged by AIDS.  At his best the author communicates an acute and finely developed sense of suffering and emotional neglect.  He does, on occasion, overreach.  However, on balnace, \\"You Are Not a Stranger Here\\" is both brave and assured, and Haslett has proven himself an exciting new talent.	2003-07-10

The accused are Martin, his wife Stevie and their gay teen-aged son Billy.  Albee challenges us to question the nature and meaning of love.  Can love and shame coexist?  Who defines normal?  Who, or what, has been betrayed?  Who decides which behaviors are acceptable?  After the evidence has been presented and issues debated we realize that this play isn't about bestiality or infidelity, but rather intolerance, nonconformity and the arbitrariness of societal standards.  Does Albee provide any answers?  No, he insists, as he always has, that you find your own.  A truly great play.	2003-05-15

There are shades of the Tennessee Williams classic \\"The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone,\\" yet the writing style is more akin to Patrick Gale's early works \\"The Aerodynamics of Pork\\" and \\"Kansas in August.\\"<br />Pym's novels are what used to be called \\"comedies of manners.\\"  Her work is immediately engaging, always amusing, and quite pointed in its depiction of a woman so consumed with the appearence of perfection that she misses every opportunity for happiness.	2003-02-10

US	40157449	R13VO8TJO6FO	0684852705	373427782	Hamlet's Dresser: A Memoir	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A real treat for anyone who grew up loving the theatre.	This was the most enjoyable book I've read in quite some time. A rare and wonderfully detailed account of one young man's coming of age in Stratford, Connecticut. Not your standard sexual awakening tales. No, this is a story of a spiritual awakening - a discovered kinship with Shakespeare and the Muses of comedy and tragedy. Bob Smith tells his story with compassion, wit and elegance. He doesn't shy away from the troubling memories of dealing with a mentally impaired sibling, nor the profound impact she had on his life and the lives of his parents. What the reader is left with is a sure sense of the authors humanity. His Shakespeare classes for senior citizens - the special relationships and bonds that he has nutured with lovers of The Bard - those famous and those seemingly forgotten about. Bob Smith's story is inspiring on many levels. However, the greatest gift this book gives us is a beautiful articulation of the awe and wonder that can only be found in the thaetre.	2003-02-07

I don't say best because \\"best\\" is too subjective a term to be applied to the arts.  Albee is important because of the influence his work has had on playwrights such as Arthur Kopit, Sam Shepard, John Guare and David Mamet.  Mel Gussow has produced an indelible portrait of this artist.  One revels in Albee's current success - The Tony Award for \\"The Goat or Who is Sylvia?\\" and a Pulitzer Prize for \\"Three Tall Women.\\"  However, what Mr. Gussow's biography illustrates brilliantly is that Albee hasn't staged a \\"comeback.\\"  Indeed, Albee never went anywhere - it was the audience and the critics that abandoned Albee.  Throughout the past forty years Albee has continued to produce masterful plays - award winning plays - \\"A Delicate Balance,\\" \\"All Over,\\" \\"Seascape\\" and \\"The Lady from Dubuque\\" - plays which are finally gaining the recognition and stature they deserve.<br />The personal story is here as well.  Albee was adopted and raised by people who were emotionally aloof to the needs of a gay adolescent.  The relationships with Terrence McNally and Jonathan Thomas (his companion for the past thirty years), friendships with John and Elaine Steinbeck, Carson McCullers, William Flanagan, Alan Schneider and all those leading ladies from Uta Hagen, Colleen Dewhurst, Jessica Tandy and Irene Worth to Marian Seldes, Rosemary Harris, Elaine Stritch and Maggie Smith.  The story of how the Pulitzer Prize board denied him the honor for \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" even after the prize jury had voted unanimously for the play.  It's all here - warts and all - best of all is the happy ending.	2002-08-16

What if, after the divorce, they signed over legal guardianship to the Addams family? After finishing this crazy quilt of a memoir, most readers will wonder how Burroughs survived.<br />The reason this memoir works so well is that the author doesn't seem at all bitter about his past. His writing is inspired, informed and infused with a sardonic humor which makes the most outrageous and harrowing accounts of family dysfunction palatable.<br />This is an extremely funny book about topics often considered taboo. Both poignant and disturbing in it depiction of a family torn asunder by mental illness and emotional depravation, \\"Running with Scissors\\" nevertheless offers a rare and wonderful look at the nuclear family - after the explosion.	2002-07-30
US	40157449	R28SUA9OIVYXMP	0805005471	337367339	The Collected Poems of A. E. Housman	Books	5	26	29	N	N	Should not be missed.	Unrequited love and youthful death are the author's recurrent themes.  Always forthright and devoid of the esoteric and modernistic qualities of more revered poets, Housman's work, though imbued with a pronounced melancholy, is never strident or sanctimonious.  It is through the symmetry of theme that Housman achieves the solemnity which lends these justly celebrated poems their stature.<br />I feel that any discussion of A. E. Housman's poetry should first acknowledge that he was never a poet in the same sense as Whitman, Auden or Ginsberg.  he was first, and foremost, a scholar, the Chair of Latin at Cambridge and an academic legend.  Thus it seems churlish for his detractors to take the rather meagre amount of poetry he produced and deride it for it's lack of thematic multiplicity.<br />A closeted homosexual, Housman's poetry is perhaps most distinctive for it allusive qualities.  One revels in the allegorical poem XVIII from Additional Poems: \\"Oh they're taking him to prison for the colour of his hair.\\"  Perhaps my favorite in this collection full of favorites is XXXI from More Poems:<br />\\"Because I liked you better<br />  Than suits a man to say,<br />It irked you, and I promised<br />  To throw the thought away.<br />To put the world between us<br />  We parted, stiff and dry;<br />'Good-bye', said you, 'forget me.'<br />  'I will, no fear' said I.<br />If here, where clover whitens<br />  The dead man's knoll, you pass,<br />And no tall flower to meet you<br />  Starts in the trefoiled grass,<br />Halt by the headstone naming<br />  The heart no longer stirred,<br />And say the lad that loved you<br />  Was one that kept his word.\\"<br />Haunting.  First rate.  A masterful collection.	2002-03-25
