Many objects that seem insignificant turn up later, revealing their significance in the big scheme of things.  The story, although funny, isn't necessarily an easy read.  It reveals many details relating to other points carrying on throughout the novel and the whole series of novels.  Douglas Adams take his readers through his points of view about the universe, which often leaves the reader saying, \\"What the crap?\\"  However one can't help laughing at how ridiculous the situation is.  The book is definitely difficult to put down.<BR> All who like science fiction will love Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  One does need to keep an open mind while reading the novel because Adams makes fun of most aspects of the creation of the universe that are popular to most people.  If in general you have no idea what you believe and you do get offended is your own damn problem.  After all, it's just science fiction. It's not like he means it!  In closing, \\"life, we apologize for the inconvenience.\\"	2004-04-07

Jason Bourne in The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum experiences this. In his world he is born an adult and discovers quickly that he has very disturbing talents such as brutal self-defense skills, harsh interrogative capabilities, and  an extensive knowledge of weaponry. This book offers a very intriguing and fruitful plot. I enjoyed reading The Bourne Identity because Robert Ludlum goes into depth about the modus operandi of all of the antagonists, protagonists, and governmental intelligence agencies. In this book Robert Ludlum has a tendency to elaborate too much about situations at times. Sometimes this would cause me to lose interest and focus. Other than that I felt that The Bourne Identity was very enjoyable to read.<BR> In The Bourne Identity the suspense never ceases to exist. The main characters are always running, scheming, or fighting for their lives. Someone seeking to read an action packed, adventure novel will most likely enjoy this book. Also, someone who enjoys learning about psychology and how the brain works will enjoy this book very much. In this book, one will understand how someone could react in certain situations after having experienced extreme amnesia. Throughout this book Jason Bourne hears certain things or sees certain things that for some reason make him see horrific images. A psychiatrist or psychology teacher would most definitely love this book. Someone wanting a more mellow or laid back book would not enjoy this book because every moment is intense, gripping, and at any given instant something crazy can spontaneously occur. Again, I would recommend The Bourne Identity to anyone seeking an intense adventure.	2004-04-05

The main character, Frodo Baggins, exhibits outstanding courage and bears the burden of the ring, which gives its user awesome power.  The ring also easily corrupts the mind of all its users.  Frodo and his life long best friend Sam are determined to stick together no matter what danger they encounter.  It is an excellent display of friendship, and although this is a fictional novel, the qualities exhibited by each and every character make readers feel as if the story is real and they are actually in the setting of the story.<br />  Some may say that the first part of the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy is slow and boring, but I believe the books serves a very important purpose and sets up what is yet to come in this exciting series by J.R.R. Tolkien.  _The Fellowship of the Ring_ is by far one of Tolkien's best works of literature, and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fictional adventure stories.

Rowling is the third novel in her entertaining fantasy series about Harry Potter, a teenage wizard and his encounters with the evil Lord<BR>Voldemort.  Being a new reader to the fantasy world, I was delightfully surprised.  The vivid descriptions and enticingly fun characters make this novel and its series a must read for all young and old who enjoy the possibilities and illusions of magic.  Harry Potter is not an intellectual book by any means, but it has a certain allure all its own.  To be able to slip away and to envision a magical place like Hogwarts Castle with Harry, Ron, and Hermione is an experience.  It's almost as if the story comes to life in your mind's eye and the magnitude of the experience is unforgettable.  <BR> I enjoyed this book so much after the first time I read it, that I reread it eight times in succession.  The character flaws of Harry are endearing and create a sense of friendship between the reader and him.  With both petty and insignificant conflict as well as tear-jerking and serious uproars, the novel keeps readers on their toes.  After every time I read this particular book I tended to learn more and make my own impressions about what exactly this book mean and<BR>represents.  I think this book is very well written, and even though it is a fantasy book, J.K. Rowling throws real life in the mix of this novel to make it more real and therefore better.	2004-04-01

It tells how a young genius and his team started from the beginning, to finish at the end taking advantage of Vegas for more then three million dollars. It started as a team of six MIT college students playing blackjack in their dorm, and learning a way of \\"counting cards\\" called the hi-lo theory. They then took their skills to Vegas where they then met money and the trouble that goes with it. The author Ben Mezrich was able to get inside the group and get the inside story to make one novel that gets you from start to finish.<br /><br /> Bringing Down the House relates to anybody who has ever gambled or even thought about it. The book is even a little bit of manual on how to play blackjack, it even tells you how to count cards and cheat your way to the top. It tells you how far casinos go to bust you, and how you get treated in the \\"back room\\". It shows you how the \\"whales\\"  treat the dealers, and how a thousand dollar tip is nothing to blink at. It explains how greed can effect anyone, and when you have it all, its just not good enough.	2004-04-01

What I understand from this book is that the boy narrator is having a tough time growing up in Northern Ireland, haunted by the truth of his family.  Some things he wants to believe and the rest he doesn't want to.  I did not particularly care for this book because of how hard it is for me to follow.  Other than the constant jumping around from different scenes and scenarios, it is a good book as far as the context is concerned.<br />I would recommend this book to people who are interested in Irish history, what people live like around that time.   Another thing that might interest people would be how parents discipline their kids when they got in trouble.  Also people who like books that jump around so much that it is hard for people like me to follow might enjoy the challenge.	2004-03-31

Set in Nineteenth Century England, the tale of murder and a family curse will hold the reader's attention until the end. When Sir Charles Baskerville mysteriously dies and the heir to his estate is threatened, the real mystery begins. Doyle's masterful writing style is easy to follow and flows so well the book will be over before the reader realizes it.<br /> I enjoyed this Sherlock Holmes mystery because it is easy to read and it flows well. For me, a person that does not usually like classics- or mysteries for that matter, I really enjoyed this book. The story kept my interest and it kept me guessing throughout the entire book. This story is not a thriller, but it is still a good mystery. For someone who prefers John Grisham suspense or a CSI type story line, this book is probably not for them. However, for someone who enjoys simple mysteries and likes to play the role of detective as they read, I would recommend this book.	2004-03-31

It was one of the very few books that has kept me pulled in and interested the entire time.  The characters were real, and the story gave distinct detail about their physical appearances and individual personalities.  It shows the struggle of a Jewish family trying to stay together, and most of all stay alive.  You feel as though you are right there with the characters though every life threatening account with the German Nazi's.<BR>     The people who will like this book are individuals that may be interested in World War II, or the history of Germany and Holland during the 1940's.  This could also be intriguing for people who enjoy reading about life struggles and how people have overcome them.	2004-03-31

The story is a first person account of the life of Jane Eyre, beginning with her own experiences at school, progressing to events after her school days, when she herself becomes a teacher, in the home of the mysterious Mr. Rochester.  The story moves rather slowly, and the immortal romance that supposedly makes this novel a classic is quite disguised by the strict code of British propriety.  Bronte also only develops the main characters in her story.  She doesn't spend much time with the characterization of the minor players in her novel, and so the reader is left with a continuing sense of detachment while reading.  The plot line of the novel is not boring, however, and there are some twists and turns that allow readers to keep reading until the conclusion.  On the whole, the book is somewhat slow, with a sense of detachment in terms of characterization.<BR> This novel would be enjoyed by anyone with an enthusiasm for classical Victorian literature.  In terms of age, this book would not be appropriate for anyone under high school age, just because of the usage of older English.  I would also recommend this book to the more astute members of our audience, just because this book requires a certain discipline to finish.	2004-03-31

This novel is very real which leads it to be depressing.  I am not real sure I liked the book.  It was interesting, but it was never very happy.  The main character, Eliezer, comes from a concentration camp to New York and tries to start his life over.  He is soon afterwards hit by a taxicab and severely hospitalized in a body cast.  He then reflects on his life up to that point as he lies in the hospital all day talking with his doctor about death, pain, and love.  His doctor meanwhile tries to figure out if the accident really was an accident.<br /> People interested in relationships or a person's psyche may be interested in this novel.  The reader is invited into every thought that Eliezer has.  It is very personal, and Eliezer is very depressed from a tormented past from concentration camps and the catastrophe that happens to his people.  He contemplates all aspects of living after being so near death.  I am not really sure anyone will enjoy this book.  This book is more of an eye opener.  This is a good book for people who enjoy realism and pessimistic symbolism.	2004-03-31

I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it showed how the children were guided and how the knowledge of an Aborigine boy provides a vital source of information that greatly increases their chances of survival.  The story had an excellent flow to it, and the word choice is exceptional, Marshall's description of the land lets the readers imaginations' run rampant.  My only complaint about this book would be the fact that it was a little slow at times, but overall it was an excellent, well-written book.<BR>I would recommend this book to anyone who is captivated by the television show Survivor.  There are so many descriptions of native plant life and species of animals that provide a source of nutrition for the children.  Also, anyone who is interested in the outdoors and living in harsh, extreme conditions would be fascinated by the techniques that are used to stay alive by the Aborigine boy.  These skills have been used for thousands upon thousands of years, but they still hold true even in the technologically advanced 21st century. This book was an excellent read, and it would most likely be enjoyed by anyone who read it.	2004-03-31

I really enjoyed this book because of the cluster of details that allowed you to picture what was going on and play it out in you mind. It is fairly easy to read and does not take much time. People who like adventure and fantasy would enjoy reading the first book of the series. I would recommend this book for any age group.<br /> The story starts off with Harry arriving at his aunt and uncles house as an infant. Harry lives with them until he is of age to attend Hogwart's. The years he lives with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and his Cousin Dudley are not all great. He sleeps in the closet under the stairs and gets hand me down clothes from his fat cousin.

The story follows an American woman who comes to find herself becoming a part of an ancient civilization and relaying their message of life.  Because everyone at one time or another can get caught up in hurried and materialisitic ways of life, Mutant Message is able to point out that what is urgent isn't always necessary, and what is necessary isn't always urgent.<br />This book bends the minds of those people who forget the truest and most basic purpose of life.  For anyone willing to open a third eye and think about a different way, this book will hold its reader to a different standard.  Mutant Message does not hold a strong plot or even a noticeable climax, but what it lacks it makes up for in a strong message through themes and symbolism.	2004-03-31

In this epic about a little, non-adventurous person, J. R. R. Tolkien introduces Bilbo Baggins to his first adventure.  The Hobbit starts off with Gandalf, the wizard, paying Bilbo an unexpected visit, not only bringing along thirteen guests, but bringing Bilbo the news that would change his life, forever.  I enjoyed reading this adventure-filled epic, as it took me on countless journeys and introduced me to goblins, wild wolves, orcs, eagles, elves, and many, many more creatures found throughout the novel.  The adventures never ended, and when I thought I was safe to conclude a happy ending, another villain was at hand.  The twist and turns take readers out of their reading places and into the dungeons and caves along with Bilbo and his companions.<br /> I would recommend this epic to open-minded people who can let their minds wander once and awhile.  People should not begin reading this novel if they are not imaginative and cannot picture weird creatures never before seen.  Also, if you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings trilogy, you will definitely love this prelude.  This epic will interest those adventure-fantasy lovers out there!	2004-03-31

This is a well-written novel about a team of strong rugby players and their loyal fans and family who crash on a plane in the high Andes Mountains.  Their only shelter was the plane's shattered fuselage and their only supplies consisted of wine, marmalade, and a few candy bars.  This story captures this horrific catastrophe and the amazing survival of the original thirty-two survivors to the final sixteen that actually made it out alive after they resorted to canabalism.  I loved this novel and believe it is the best non-fiction adventure ever written.  As I read about their story, I felt as though I knew the characters personally and began to truly feel emotions and troubles they were experiencing.  Alive is very realistic and captures the hopelessness of the situation and the special bonds between the survivors.  After reading Alive, absolutely no one will underestimate their will to survive.<br />Alive is especially appealing to those people who enjoy suspenseful adventures novels.  Anyone who loves detailed accounts of nature and its landscape will enjoy it thoroughly.  I would venture to guess that a wide range of people would love it and would never want to set this great novel down including; health professionals, athletes and outdoor enthusiasts.	2004-03-31

The facts were all there to believe entirely that Walter Sickert, the supposed \\"Jack,\\" murdered these 19th century English prostitutes. However, the book doesn't allow much room for making an educated guess on who the murderer is. The book is somewhat biased in that sense, but the author was able to back up any assumptions with clear, logical evidence. <br /> The book is an enticing, titillating thriller, but unlike other murder mystery stories, this one is entirely fact, thus increasing the excitement of the reading process. The gruesome pictures of the four dead women, as well as Sickert and his family, could make a statue bend over in queasiness. The detail of the women's sufferings are graphic, but to a point that makes you feel for them but not pity them. It is a great book and especially good for fans of notorious murderers and the crimes they committed.	2004-03-31

I love books that are easy to relate to.  The characters are so vivid and different from each other, which makes the book captivating the entire way through.  Each of the girls is experiencing an exciting adventure that makes the book almost impossible to put down.  It contains every element of a great book.<BR> <BR>        The reason I believe that almost anyone could enjoy the book is because the characters are so easy to relate to.  Since each girl is going through different and exciting adventures it is like four books in one.  Ann Brashares illustrates a friendship that everyone wishes they had.

The pace of the book quickly moved me through the story, keeping me interested throughout.  The characters are the cornerstones of the story. The personality of the protagonist, Lucas Corso, is easy to identify with. He is a lonely man who, although selfish and cutthroat, still holds at least some of the reader's sympathy.  The most interesting and fascinating pieces of the book are Corso's dialogues with Boris Balkan and the mysterious girl. These conversations are often thought provoking and filled with discussion on good and bad.  The antagonist, Boris Balkan, is a less interesting character, conforming to a standard literary archetype of the old, wealthy man, obsessed with a dream that takes it too far.<BR> Much of the plot revolves around the story and characters of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers.  The personality of The Three Musketeers characters and plots are so intertwined with The Club Dumas that I would recommend this book mainly to those who have read The Three Musketeers.  Although fans of mystery and suspense novels may still enjoy the book, to receive the greatest understanding and delight from the book a reader should read both.	2004-03-31

As usual, not afraid to take on controversial issues, Crichton explores the world of sexual harassment from the point of view of a harassed male. By looking at the issue from an uncommon viewpoint, he uncovers the underlying issues at stake. He reveals the emotions behind sexual harassment while not letting them interfere with the facts. Crichton wraps this well-researched information in a compelling story of corporate politics and intrigue. What is most amazing, however, is that he can write a book about so morbid a topic while keeping the story appealing. Though at points I felt offended by graphic descriptions, the story was far too engaging to put down.<BR> Any fan of Michael Crichton will discover that this is one of his best novels; even someone new to Crichton will derive great pleasure from Disclosure's many twists and turns. Though not for the easily offended, his fast-paced, addictive style of writing is enjoyable and thoroughly satisfying. From cover to cover, Disclosure is an excellent novel.	2004-03-31

The novel is based around Eva Buchbinder's experiences in a Nazi labor camp.  Anne Isaacs shows each character's feelings and actions using in-depth descriptions.  While reading this novel, one actually feels the hunger and grief Eva and her friends feel while starving and working within the cruel conditions of the labor camp.  Isaacs does a great job using the varied emotions and personalities of the characters to describe the harshness of the labor camps instead of bloody and intense graphical descriptions.    <br /> People interested in the harsh conditions for those in the German Nazi labor camps will love this book.  If one is interested in the real facts and tragedies of the labor camps instead of a romanticized version, read this book.  This novel is not difficult to read and comprehend.  It just takes human compassion.  One will not be able to put this book down out of concern for the lives of those in the death camps.  Upon finishing this novel, the reader will have a greater appreciation for life and the freedom it now holds.	2004-03-31

There was a lot of talking, but did not go into full detail of how he became Mr. Hyde. The author would even go back in time to things that had nothing to do with the story line. When I think of Mr. Hyde, I think of more chase scenes and anger. I also think of more scenes of Dr. Jekyll in his laboratory. The ending was also kind of plain and boring; I like endings that give me closure or an ending that hints of a second book.<br />Older people who like old British novels would like this book because older novels were written in the same form. People who have a lot of time on their hands would like this book; it takes a long time to read it. People who read a lot and do not get bored by a slow book and do not fall asleep could read this book. British Literature majors would also like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde because of the style of writing.

I also think that learning about submarines and what the crew of a submarine experiences is fascinating.  Next, the main character, Jack Ryan, is a great person to read about.  He is put in many tough positions, and he always uses his intelligence to succeed.  I want to root for Ryan because of the way he persists and prevails throughout the novel.<br />I feel that a number of different types of people will enjoy this book as much as I do.  Specifically, I recommend this novel to anyone who has a great interest in the CIA and the governments of other countries, especially people who like to know extensive inside information about how governments work.  Also, people who think that submarines are interesting, as well as warfare between sea-faring vessels, will enjoy this book.  In general, this book has a lot of suspense, so people who enjoy action and drama may like this book even if the Russian politics and submarines are not highly fascinating to them.	2004-03-31

Every level of regulation, from anarchy to fascist dictatorships, is comparatively some amount of government.  Ayn Rand shows the dismal struggles surrounding Kira Argounov in her communist environment.  Through maginificent language, _We the Living_ forces empathy for starving masses; in a way that no news article can.  As the book progresses, an awareness is awakened that every aspect of each person's life is painful, yet each person fights to keep on living.  Ayn Rand presents a dieing city, and develops human characters who force themselves to live through it.  Although, what these characters go through on a daily basis is not quite the same as living.  Their USSR regulates the distribution of food, clothing, and shelter; a corrupt hierarchy with ambiguous goals and morals regulates every physical human necessity.  The suffering is deadly, but the struggles for life are sifting through the propaganda and government denials, staking out some form of existence.<BR>     Ayn Rand analyzes a multitude of varied relationships, between deluges of personalities.  Throughout the story, people grow and change as they try with all human strength to adapt to their new world.  This novel is about character development in an environment created by Soviet mismanagement.  It shows how people cope with the stresses of staying alive, when that in itself becomes the primary concern.  Things taken for granted by the rest of the world are denied to a population of millions.  A home, a job, and even one's own free time are all the concerns of an ever present government.  Human nature is captured in the interactions of characters, and sometimes it can be a terrible thing.  Power struggles created by the voids left by a revolution have to be settled, and some people will go to far to fill those voids.  This is a fast read about politics and humanity that will leaves questions about all governments, and if this could ever happen again.	2004-03-31

By looking at the cover, readers see a young boy flying on a broomstick with a cloak on his back.  When I first started reading the book, I was very interested.  A baby being dropped off at someone's doorstep, and cats reading newspapers are not normal to most people.  You just want to keep reading, because they cannot think of what might happen next.<BR> <BR>This book has many other books along with it.  It's kind of a never-ending story, with all the other books and movies that have come out since they started making Harry Potter.  This book is a fantasy with a mystery. This book is not for all people because of some beliefs about magic, myths and lies.  At the same time, it's mainly written for children and young adults.  There is something that makes its seem so real and extremely interesting, that makes adults and the elderly love this book as much as children. It is kind of a family story that everyone loves.	2004-03-31

He is trapped in the world of limbo, and is a slave to any who can bacon him; until one day he is awakened with no master and a girl that calls out his name, Azreil, in the last moments of her life.

These are the opening words of The Stranger, which I found to be one of the most interesting and psychologically challenging books I have read thus far.<BR> The book begins with the stranger attending his mother's funeral and displaying a puzzling lack of emotion toward his mother's death.<BR> I loved reading this book.  There were times when I could not put it down if I tried and other times when it was difficult to get into.  The main reason why I enjoyed reading this book is because of Albert Camus' unique style of writing.  He adds such meticulous character descriptions and detail to every aspect of the book it never really gets boring, even during less interesting sections.  The storyline is somewhat difficult to follow.  For those who have seen Seinfeld, I would relate this book to a Seinfeld episode: lots of jumping around from scene to scene and many complicated situations.  This sense of chaos adds to the intensity and nature of the book itself. <BR> I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy an intellectual challenge and also to people who enjoy learning about different cultures.  This book will open up even the most closed off mind.	2004-03-31

This book helps explain the connection between the movie and the TV series. The one character from the movie, Pike comes to Buffy and her gang, for help from the monster that has been following him. They all get together to defeat this \\"big-bad\\" like they always do. The past is pretty much revisited in this book.<BR>     I would recommend this book to teenagers and those who like the TV series. It ties up a lot of loose ends between the movie and series, so those who wonder how they go together would now have the answers. This also is a pretty simple read, so for those looking for something not too difficult, this would be a great book.	2004-03-31

Janet Evanovich is an author of comedic mystery with a definite element of suspense. The characters that she develops are a perfect fit for the style of writing. I believe Lula to be the most original character of them all. The things that she says and the way she acts keeps a readers laughing and peoples minds twisting and turning with thoughts.<br /> For a person to read and enjoy this book, people need to like suspenseful mysteries that have a romantic and sexy twist to them every once in a while. I recommend this book to women more so than men because it is written with a woman's point of view. Overall, this book is great and once you read this you will want to read all the rest of the Stephanie Plum series. I definitely recommend the Stephanie Plum series to a person who is able to handle the thrills of these wonderfully well written books.	2004-03-31

This on the edge thriller has been proclaimed one of the most controversial books of our time. The story tells the tale of a professor's trip to Paris over a 48-hour period. The plot thickens continually with every turn of a page. There is not a chapter that passes without some sort of plot changing event. This story will have readers on their toes the entire time and wishing it would never end<BR> The book however is not for everyone. I would say the age limit on this book would be the biggest barrier. Somebody under the age of 16 might miss some of the underlying themes in the story, most of which are crucial. It would help a reader to have some sort of religious background, however it is not necessary. The Catholic Church has claimed the book to be completely untrue and unethical. Dan Brown wrote this book as fiction for a reason. Bottom line: if you want a book that will completely captivate and entertain you, The Da Vinci Code is for you.	2004-03-31

The main character is Griet, a young girl from Holland who is devastated when she discovers that her father has become blind. With her family unable to pay for living expenses, Griet must become a maid to the famous artist Vermeer and his family. The author does a marvelous job describing the portraits Vermeer paints. It is almost as if the portraits come alive in the story. The story does not have any boring points and keeps readers on their toes as Griet struggles with growing up and is torn when deciding who or what to love. <br />Teenagers, myself included, can relate to Griet as she searches for herself and realizes her responsibilities as she grows up. Griet understands that she must support her family. Living with the painter forces her to grow in many aspects. All teenagers should read this book because of the life's lessons it portrays. Readers do not have to like art to appreciate this book. The appreciation comes with the author's beautifully written novel that causes readers to be anxious for the end throughout the whole story.	2004-03-31

The author really makes readers feel like they are there with the characters.  Harry Potter depicts how most teenagers feel when they are going through their adolescent years.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get sucked into a great story about magic and adventure.  <BR> This book is the fifth edition of the Harry Potter series.  The others must be read to understand this one.  The story starts out in Privet Drive.  This is where Harry lives with his Aunt, Uncle, and cousin.  Weird and crazy things happen before he leaves for school.  Harry goes to the school of Hogwarts; where more weird and crazy things are happening and teachers are acting strangely.

This book kept me on the edge and wanting to know more and more. The many riddles in this book are intricately woven and geniously put in to keep the reader guessing. This book doesn't just jump around like others, but gives you, in full detail, the situation of the current events and any background information needed to understand (and there's a bunch). I thought that the symbolism and allegories were very intriguing, and they made me want to try and figure out what they could be before I actually knew the answer. And maybe the best part is that there seems to be no resolution, only climax right until the end! All-and-all, this is one of the best books that I have read.<br /> This book is for anyone who loves to be toyed with and kept guessing before the revealing of the twisted truth. For those who like to find hidden meanings in allegories, this is a great book. The plot is consistent throughout, but it is how the story plays out that makes it most interesting. If you like tons of mystery and suspense that will make you want to stay up late at night just to figure out the next mystery, this book is for you. And let's not forget those who are interested in a novel that deals with religious artifacts, great action, and a good thriller.<br />Chris Protos	2004-03-31

This is the story of a dog that lived the rich life and was then suddenly jerked out of it into the harsh real world where he learns to survive on instincts given to him by his primordial ancestors.  Buck, which is the name of the dog, learns not only to survive in the wilderness but also to thrive and to be top dog.  Never before has he actually felt a bond with a human being until a man by the name of Thornton rescues him from a foolish death.  Buck is torn between the feeling of returning to his natural state in the wild and his loyalty to Thornton.  Although he loves this man, he continues to hear the call of wolves, which are his own call of the wild.<br />In this book London brings out a 3rd person point of view where we can see the feelings and thoughts of both the dogs and the men.  He almost makes Buck seem human by having him deal with internal conflicts.  I believe that many people can relate to Buck's story of dealing with the real world and having to depend on themselves to survive.  It would be a great book for anyone who loves the out doors and who wants to read an adventure novel.  It's an easy read because it constantly keeps the reader's attention by not using difficult and confusing language. This story may be short but all of it's content is used on the whole point of the story.	2004-03-31

I enjoy suspenseful adventure books that have a sense of reality.  This book shares the story or a young boy and his family's life, when their world is turned upside down.  The author always keeps a surprise right around the corner, and the reader never knows if Zach's going to make it or ruin everything.  The author also does a good job of making the reader feel for Zach.  As I watched him try to start his life over, make new friends, and have a crush on a girl in his class; I could not help but feel as if I knew exactly what he was feeling.<BR> If you enjoy suspenseful, realistic stories, this is a book for you.  If you don't mind a sad book, you will enjoy the adventure Zach and his family encounter.  After a life threatening encounter and a life changing realization, Zach, his mother, and his sister leave their father and their lives to start over.  You follow Zach on his new adventures in his new life as he tries to cope with his situation.  The book ends as if it was just beginning and leaves you wanting to read more.	2004-03-31

This couple consists of the delightful Tailor, and his wife Ansty. Although at first, Cross's approach to introducing the reader to these people seems awkward, it also entices and draws the reader into this captivating setting. Through the Tailor's stories, none of which one may be certain are true, and Ansty's nagging, I began to feel as though I knew these people as well as Cross. I frequently had to remind myself, though, that they are no longer living.<br />Although my original interest in reading the novel stemmed from my person interest in my Irish ancestry, I am well convinced that anyone could find this an entertaining read. Fantastic stories are something that everyone has grown up with, and although the Tailor's may be more mature than those I personally recall at times, the stories the Tailor heartily shares are no different. I cannot avoid the fact that the novel was banned after it's original release, although I do not entirely understand why, and therefore must warn people with more conservative views on life to avoid this novel, because they may not view it in the light it is meant to be seen.	2004-03-31

I generally stick to the Fantasy genre, so I was hesitant about reading a murder mystery. However, once I started reading it was hard to put down. The main character, Lucas Davenport, is portrayed so realistically the reader is drawn to him and wants to know more. John Sandford made him the hero without all the stereotypical qualities; you see Lucas Davenport's faults throughout the novel. Although the reader is aware of the crime and who committed it the whole way through, it is suspenseful and exciting the entire ride.<BR> I recommend this book to high school students and adults, either male or female. The book is easy to read, yet exciting enough to keep these age groups interested the whole way. The adult content of the book is too graphic for younger ages. This book is easily enjoyed and suitable for almost anyone.	2004-03-31

It is about a little girl who gets lost in the middle of the woods and can't stop thinking of how many people die in the woods because of starvation, thirst and even disgusting creatures that lurk in the dark.  (I really liked this book because it kept me reading and wanting to keep reading.  I am not much of a reader myself, but this book captivated me in a way that most books wouldn't have.  The main character was a city girl who went by the name of Trisha.  During the novel she shows that she has a very wandering mind.)<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense, drama, and a little sense of reality.  A person with a good imagination and multiple personalities would also, I believe find this a very indulging novel.  This is a short book, which makes it very easy to read for speed-readers.  There are a lot of plot changes throughout the novel, which adds to the reader's suspense.  I would most definitely recommend this book to all readers in general.	2004-03-31

Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I often found myself re-reading a paragraph so I could fully understand what I had just read.  These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.<br /> I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students.

Even being so long, the first thought through my mind at the end of the 800 plus pages was, \\"When's the next one coming out?\\"<br />    The theme in this book is almost too harsh and real for the young children stereotyped as typical Potter readers. With the brutality of death and torture present I would not recommend it for most children under the age of 10. I see 15-20 year olds particularly enjoying it, Harry's social and puberty dilemmas are understandable and many of us can relate, add in the fantasy element and this book is truly a fascinating read.	2004-03-31

It is filled with wild stories of being on the road, performing at concerts, and taking part in the Los Angeles party scene.  The book is well written, and really held my attention.  Any person who enjoys a nostalgic trip through the groovy 60s will enjoy this book.  It gives a sense of how society was affected by music and the changing times.  <BR> The Lizard King clearly depicts Jim Morrison's entire life; starting with his fairly average childhood in a military family, his wild college years, and the fast paced years with his band, The Doors.  All of the events that are chronicled lead up to his untimely demise, which is still somewhat of a mystery and is widely disputed.  There are several interviews at the end of the book, collected from various magazines that were popular in the late 60s, which show the intellectual side of Jim Morrison. I highly recommend this book to all fans of The Doors, or anyone that is interested in Jim Morrison- the rock star poet. This page-turner is sure to captivate anyone who reads it.	2004-03-31

As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well  ........

Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it.	2004-03-31

Each individual carries a scared past.  Hana is a nurse drained from war and seeking a hideaway.  When the unit she is with leaves, Hana stays behind to care for a horribly burned, enigma of a man--known only as the English patient--who fell from the sky with a fiery crash into the desert.  Later, a scarred thief named Caravaggio and a bomb-wary sapper cross into their lives.  Each stranger unfolds and slowly is given character.  Laced with the current story is that of the bed-ridden English patient; haunted by his ghosts, whose constant recanting gives light to a dazzling tale of the obsession of love for a woman and passion so strong it is worth betrayal.<BR> Many abstract memories of each character interlace into the main tale, which many readers are discouraged by.  If a reader takes the time to understand and pay close attention to detail, the story unfolds brilliantly.  The characters are some of the most human and diverse that have been crafted.  It is introspectively healing, but more importantly it is a tale about love and the obsession that it brings, including the human need and lust for it.  This story is for meticulous, passionate readers, seeking to simply looking for the human truth about love and pain.  I enjoyed this book and have granted a special place for it as one of my favorite books of all time.	2004-03-31
US	19735302	R3PJM3NSH56CO7	0679721037	150142267	Hiroshima	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Hiroshima	Hiroshima, John Hersey's retelling of the events surrounding the United States' August 6, 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, gives an historical account different from those that are usually given to Americans.  Hersey tells the story of Hiroshima through third person narratives of the lives of several survivors of the bombing.  This is different from most Americanized stories, in which the bombing is usually viewed through the eyes of one or more Americans involved in the bombing.  This is one of the positive qualities of the book, as it forces Western readers to view the bombing from the receiving end, allowing them to gain a different perspective.  Before reading Hiroshima, I was like many Americans in my beliefs about the use of nuclear weapons.  While I have always known that such weapons are destructive, horrible things, Hiroshima has caused me to rethink my own view on the possible future use of these weapons.  I used to jokingly say, \\"Let's just nuke `em!\\" whenever a foreign power came to arms with the United States.  After reading Hiroshima and taking in the graphic depictions of victims, I would never think of seriously favoring the use of nuclear weapons.  While I cannot say that I enjoyed reading about carnage and the after-effects of radiation, as a history fan and as an American, I enjoyed being given a new point of view of an event which I thought I knew a lot about.<br />Hiroshima, while interesting and thought provoking, is not a book to be enjoyed by all people.  The graphic scenes following the bombing can be physically sickening at times, even for those who think they are prepared for such violence.  These scenes only help to convey the message that nuclear weapons and war in general are terrible things.  Most history fans, especially those interested in World War II, might like this book for its historical importance.  As a novel, the book does not serve much of an entertainment purpose.  Anyone researching weapons of mass destruction, Japanese history, or World War II would definitely find this a useful book.	2004-03-31

The stories date back at least to 947, and it is amazing that great literary stories such as these have been kept alive by the dreamers who embrace them.  This book by Naomi Lewis is only a small collection of the stories.  I encourage dreamers to read this book as a starting point for finding the perfect mysterious fantasy collection.<BR> One thing to love about this book is the fact that it is the equivalent of today's campfire stories, only these take place hundreds of years ago.  These stories are the middle-eastern viewpoint of stories that are universally used.  For instance the story `The Anklet' is of course Cinderella, yet it is also `Ashputtel' in Germany.  Many age-old stories have been translated and have drifted around Europe and neighboring continents, giving us a similar story plot but are characteristic of the culture they come from.  <BR>          Personally, I love to read a collection of good short stories, and the structure of this book has kept my attention.  A girl in danger of losing her life to a mad husband tells the stories.  So the great stories in the book are a result of, in fact, an outside story.  This novel structure is one that definitely keeps my attention, and my eyes glued to it.  For those who have trouble finding a good book to read to the sleepy kids, this is an excellent bedtime book.  And on a side note, mixing a bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate topping and reading this book before going to bed will guarantee a night of stellar dreams.	2004-03-31

It is just as addictive and fun as all before and after it. While listening to Death, his unwilling granddaughter and the constantly ill God of Hangovers, the story of the missing Hogfather, a figure similar to Santa Claus, unfolds. The main story is incredibly amusing, but equally engrossing are the stories within the story of minor and rather odd Gods, Death's family discourse, and the existence of bogeymen, beasts and wizards. <BR>    This novel appeals to a wide variety of readers. Each person will extract something different from the story. Younger readers will enjoy the humor while older readers will appreciate the upside down philosophy and satire of Discworld. All that is really required to adore Hogfather is a sense of fun and mischief and of course one afternoon to gallivant with Death's granddaughter, the Assassins' Guild and a whole slough of wizards.	2004-03-31

Four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, have been sent to live with an unusual professor.  While exploring his house, the four find an old wardrobe.  Inside the wardrobe they discover the beginning of their magical adventure.<BR> I had fun reading this book because it is written on two reading levels.  One level is a simple children's story.  The other had a deeper, religious connotation.  I would recommend this book to the young and young at heart because it makes a person think and is enjoyable on all levels.	2004-03-31

The majority of the book consists of a collaboration of thoughtful concerns. The book is torment upon the reader when the story begins because of an extremely slow start. The book seems to portray a stream of the author's thoughts on an extremely depressing day. Another element of the story that made taking a look at the book worthwhile is how the author highlights cause and effect of the main character. This gives a basis for the plot to further itself.<br /> The plot contains a few chilling surprises throughout the story. These twists fail to spice up the depressing and slow nature of the story. The story is short and does give the reader some insight as I have said before, but it isn't nearly enough to attract the majority of people. If you are looking for a book with some social insight you might find this book interesting. Otherwise, I think you need another book.	2004-03-31

The novel takes place in the romantic city of Paris, France where the main character Robert Langdon, a recognized symbologist, embarks on a remarkable adventure with a female counterpart, Sophie.  Together the two attempt to crack the mysteries of the first modern Church and where the immeasurable Holy Grail rests.  The two come across the French Police, greedy grail seekers, and people with a sufficient amount of knowledge that will either aid or harm them in the long run.  Brown's style of writing brings the reader into a well-organized and studied plot by using the famous artwork of Leonardo Da Vinci to explain his theories of the Modern Church.  <br />The book can captivate people from those who are grail seekers, to people with any form of religion and are actively interested in the formation of mankind.  I perceived the book as insightful, and one that kept me turning pages in order to reveal the outcome.  I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone with an interest in religion and who is seeking an extraordinary thrill.	2004-03-31

I love books that have some type of drama, as well as a twist of love and total romance.

All the trials and happy times are put together to create their love story. When tragedy strikes Katia's dear Sergei on November 20, 1995 her whole world changes. Katia's words are so strong that it is hard to not get sucked into the adventure of their skating life as well as their love story.<BR> My Sergei is a book that shows love for many different things. Any woman who would characterize herself as a hopeless romantic would fall in love with this novel. Anyone who has some sort of passion for something, whether it is a person of for an activity, knows how pushing yourself can change your love forever. The reader has to have an open mind and have a soft attitude about love and romance. In reading this novel, you can even find lessons that you yourself want to apply to your own life. Tears should not be an issue for those reading this novel though. Readers will definitely find him or herself feeling different emotions for a novel they never though they had.	2004-03-31

It is full of quirky and fun characters such as Mr. Pickwick himself, the constant gentleman and \\"hero\\" of the novel, and his jovial manservant Sam Weller, an amusing definition of a devoted friend.  Dickens does an excellent job of keeping the reader entertained with these eccentric characters through their many adventures and escapades.<BR> This book is great for anyone who loves Charles Dickens' literature because it shows a more comical side to his writing yet still keeps his classic style.  This book is not for those looking for a quick read.  Dickens is very verbose and elaborate in his detailing of every single aspect of the book, from the characters to the scenery.  This aspect slows the pace a little, so the reader must be at full attention at all times.  When that attention is given however, the reader becomes enthralled with clever witticisms to make anyone laugh out loud as well as intricate detailing in both setting and character that can make them feel like an intimate friend of Mr. Pickwick as they are sitting in a perfectly portrayed setting.  Dickens' sense of humor shines through Pickwick Papers through many of these situations with his mischievous use of satire.  Dickens' takes a playful aim at many subjects such as the antics of politics, the absurdity of law, and the general folly of the human race.  These features make the book an interesting and amusing read because Dickens uses his comedy to poke fun and completely entertains the reader simultaneously.  Overall, Pickwick Papers is a brilliantly written book that is sure to entertain any who take the time and effort to read it.	2004-03-31

The story is will developed, and it is written in a creative way.  Anthony Burgess uses many words pulled from other languages to replace ordinary everyday English words.  For example he uses the word \\"krovvy\\" to replace the word blood.  There is a Glossary of Nadsat Language in the back of the book.  At first the words make it difficult to comprehend what is happening.    The first couple of chapters I had to keep flipping back to the Glossary.  Then I got the hang of the words.  Not only do the different words make it an interesting read, but he also has a creative style of writing. <BR> The story is the first person view of a young boy named Alex.  It is about how he and his friends, droogies, like to walk the streets and beat people up.  Unfortunately for Alex all the trouble comes back on him.  Anthony Burgess uses Alex's story to get across many points depending upon how much one wants to reads into the story.  Burgess refers to the change in times and how the police abuse their powers by cracking down too hard.  The story is violent, but does not go into details too much to gross someone out.  I am not one who likes to read a lot, but I certainly liked this book.  I would recommend this book more to males even if they do not like to read.	2004-03-31

This is what I enjoyed most. The whole story was well depicted. Most of all however it was the life of Queen Anne and her morals, values, and compassion that made me want to never put the book down.<BR>Though the story makes the reader realize that money and wealth aren't everything. Friendship and family values are more important, and the overall lesson is about self-respect. Any reader who enjoys learning about others' trials and triumphs would really enjoy this book. Even readers who like learning about other culture's figures and role models would also enjoy this biography greatly.	2004-03-31

Frances Mayes describes in great detail her experiences as she encounters Italian life and culture in the book, Under the Tuscan Sun. Mayes and her husband purchase a rundown villa in Tuscany.  Mayes takes the reader through each of her experiences while remodeling her house, traveling the country, and engulfing herself in the Italian lifestyle.  All of the pointless descriptions of unimportant events, while she travels back and forth between America and Italy, become tedious.  Mayes attempts to capture each moment of her life and share personal memories of favorite trips though the countryside as well as cooking tips fails to capture my attention in the least.  Humorous mishaps along the way help move the reader through the seemingly endless story, but I was unable to relate to the story or stay interested enough to read it without dozing off for short spurts of time.<BR> Mayes relives her memories, and she desires to share her passion for Italy with her readers.  I recommend this book to those who are interested in everyday life and average Italian culture.  Anyone who may have visited Italy or travels may enjoy reading of Mayes' experiences.  Those who love the easy reading of true-life experiences, of renovating houses, adopting a new unknown culture, or learning new recipes for cooking foreign traditional dishes may find enjoyment from reading this book.  For others out there, along with myself, who prefer exciting action packed stories, leave Under the Tuscan Sun for those cold, restless nights; it surely drove me to a deep slumber.	2004-03-31

The story follows the lives of the members of a family through a full generation.  This results in the development of many characters, and there is probably at least one that almost any person can relate to. One thing notable about the book is its amazing attention to detail.  This was a cause of both my like and dislike for the novel.  The detail is well-written enough to leave an image in the mind of the reader upon completion of a passage, a quality not all books have.  On the other hand, the detail can be monotonous and cause the reader to lose interest. The latter is much less common, and the story kept me interested throughout.<br />This novel seems to be directed at women, and I doubt if many male readers would enjoy it.  I would recommend it to women high school age and older. However, because the story involves many relationships, I recommend that the reader is not completely opposed to the romance genre. Even readers who would not normally choose a romance novel would still enjoy this book because it includes so much more.	2004-03-31

The Da Vinci Code is a masterpiece of words put together so carefully as not to leave out any details. The story starts out in Paris, France with a murder of Jacque Saunire, the head curator at Le Louvre. This crime scene is so different from the rest; Jacques Saunire positioned himself like a pentacle, a five-sided star. Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu become involved because their are both well-known cryptologists. Throughout the whole story Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu discover more and more why this unusual crime scene happened and why they are involved. Connections with the Holy Grail, Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, Leonardo Da Vinci, and so many other people and places that bring this novel to life. <BR> I suggest this novel to people who enjoy suspense, to any religious person seeking to test their faith, and to anybody who enjoys art. There are many aspects of this novel that will make anybody go hmmm and it is always interesting to see masterpieces done by the artist mentioned in the book in a whole different way. Any readers who read this book will start to look at the world around them and wonder what is true or what are just simple \\"white lies.\\" This novel analyzes each masterpiece mentioned so that no artwork is ever the same; it is so interesting to look up the piece and actually see what has been discovered on each particular piece. I suggest that anybody who reads this book take the time to look up all that is brought up; it makes the novel even more real. I give this book two thumbs up and a must read!	2004-03-31

The book does jump from one subject to another, which makes it more interesting, and not like a regular biography.  Even if people do not like non-fiction books, this book seems like a fiction book because of the events that are not realistic.	2004-03-31
