Many knitting books are full of pretty pictures and patterns but rarely are they pictures of garments etc that real people might wear. <br />This book is WAY different.  If you're a sock knitter,no matter if you're just a beginner or a seasoned expert,  this book is a must.  Although I will warn you that life is too short to try out all the ideas shown and different, workable patterns for every kind of yarn you might imagine.  This book is definitely a keeper.	2005-09-24
US	52755952	R2FSL5ATKJAVTW	0446531456	26731198	Exact Revenge	Books	3	3	5	N	N	unbelievable	I was really caught up in this book for about the first half. Even knowing that somehow our hero was going to escape,...how else could he \\"exact revenge\\"... it was suspenseful and exciting..completely keeping my interest.  Then the story began to be totally unbelievable...and went downhill from there.  Raymond's \\"exact revenge\\" was so violent that you actually felt sorry for those he \\"revenged\\".  I scanned to the end but can only give this book 3 stars at best.	2005-08-22

There is a WIDE variety of patterns to please most anyone.  I also like the fact that the patterns are specific in naming the yarn used  which is a big help.  Directions  are very well done. All in all a great knitting book.	2005-07-19
US	52755952	R8OK3KQMIPWBI	059515414X	787166741	Screams from the Furnace	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Talk about crazy..	The \\"perp\\" in this story is a real nut case.  We never really learn why he's so obsessed with grandmother.....and as far as a newspaper reporter moving in with the \\"Streeters\\", I find that completely unbelievable.  You'll keep on reading though just to find out how in the world this story will end.  Don't worry about having nightmares from this book....it gos beyond scary to bordering on ridiculous......I gave it four stars because it is ...in spite of all my comments...an entertaining read.	2005-03-15

What a laugh riot.  People around me kept asking me what I was laughing about ....The Belle girls, the town minister, the town doctor...all have quirky ideas and each one becomes a real person ......I loved all the characters....well almost all.  If you want to really enjoy a good  book.....this is the one.  If you're from the South....well...that will just make it even more fun. the only way it could have been more fun ....if I had been sitting on the beach reading.	2005-03-03

I have rationed myself to just reading this book on my lunch hour at the office and I fear some of my co-workers are concerned after hearing me laughing out loud.  I have a very good friend who is going through grief over losing her spouse now and this book has helped me understand some of the things she has said and done. I can't read it fast enough and yet I don't  want it to end..  It should be required reading for every women who will eventually lose a spouse or has a friend going through  grief.	2004-07-02

I love to look up and see where I was those last two years....I gave three of these as Christmas gifts and the recipients are still telling me how much they enjoy theirs.  I have ordered one for a baby gift that I know will be appreciated and just now I ordered one for a bridal shower gift for a very special couple.  When you think of changes and events from a new baby or a new marriage....all recorded for 10 years and all so visible...these are really a treasure.	2004-03-14

From the prologue until the last word, I was completely taken by this book.  Neighbors form a  book club and we follow them for decades as their children are born, their marriages either strengthen or fall apart, the children grow up and leave home and at last the departure of one of the group.  I have recommended this book to all my friends....young mothers as well as grandmothers.	2003-06-01

If  you'd like some relief from profound, violent, or even sugary sweet characters, this is the book for you.  The story just rocks along at a pleasant pace.  You may guess some of the endings of each part but still it's fun just to see that ending unfold.  Read this ...you'll be glad you did.	2003-06-01

Binchy has  a way of bringing the reader into her characters' lives that I truly enjoy.  Each character is unique.  She can really &quot;spin a good yarn&quot;..	2003-02-13

WRONG!!Like others who have reviewed it, I kept on and on and on....thinking it was going to pick up soon.  Not so.  I even approached it for a while as a &quot;self-discipline exercise&quot;..all the while eyeing other books waiting to be read.   After about 150 pages, although I hardly ever admit defeat, I gave up.  I think I will investigate her first novel  as from what I've heard, it's much better reading.  ...that is...after I've read some other authors for a change.	2003-01-21

I found the characters shallow and totally unlikeable, the plot impossible to follow, and in general....just a boring book.  I read to the end  but now I don't know why I bothered.	2002-06-02
US	52755952	R1L1BRDLRN69LV	0345426266	955062554	The Analyst	Books	5	1	1	N	N	What a wild ride!!	Don't start this book until you have some time.  The first chapter will grab you....you may slow down for a while and then..watch out.....unsuspected twists and turns..yet believable.  Very frightening to think how one's whole life can be stripped away in just a few strokes of a computer or with a letter or a phone call...so many ways.  Don't scan because something will happen  in the very next sentence that you had no way of anticipating.  If Katzenbach's other books are this good, I've found a new favorite.	2002-05-20

I had so looked forward to reading Smoke Jumper based on my enjoyment of Evans' other books...i.e.  The Loop and The Horse Whisperer.  I was surprised and disappointed when I got into the story.  The story line came across so contrived it was hard to imagine Evans putting out such work.  The characters  were so heroic they were totally unbelievable.  I scanned the last 100 pages mainly to see if what I had already figured out would actually happen.  And....it did.	2002-03-26

I guessed some of it....but not near all.  It all comes together at the end although....all the way through, it's hard to connect every angle of the story.  Start this one when you have some time.	2002-02-19

Talk about a dysfunctional family!!  There is absolutely nothing to redeem any of the characters.  At times, the book was so &quot;wordy&quot;, I scanned paragraph after paragraph.  If you want to be REALLY depressed and REALLY tired of reading...try this ...it will certainly fill the bill.  I scanned (very quickly) the last 100 pages or so because I was just worn out with it.  Really don't know why I stayed with it that long except I kept thinking....something interesting surely will happen that caused this to be a best seller.	2002-01-23

I kept reading to see what other reviewers had found so rewarding about this book. With every chapter I knew practically from the first paragraph what most likely would happen and...usually I was right.  I know I can't really relate to these women and..OK..I know places like Brewster Place are painfully real all over the world....but to try to present ALL the world's problems in one book is really too much.  I guess I kept reading to the end in the faint hope that there might be one happy moment...wrong.	2001-09-10

The &quot;rescue&quot; passage was probably unrealistic but who knows what one might do under such stress.  The villain was unbelievably ahead of the game ...scary to think even Iles could think up such a plot.  Read this....it will keep you attention to the last page.	2001-08-23

Amelia is a bit weak but fits into the picture.  The &quot;ladies&quot; meet all sorts of &quot;life issues&quot;....old fears, re-live past sorrows, past failures...and through sharing it all...come through with flying colors.  Granted I'm about the age of Hannah, Grace and Amelia  so I could really relate to their foibles and successes and how they approached a situation.They may all three be a little &quot;sugar=-coated&quot; but reading this book will give you a real lift...although....beware....a few tears may fall too.  Enjoy...but don't think you've got it figured out...there are lots of surprises.	2001-08-09

As they go through their adventures in living, you want to cry out...don't do that....but...like real people...they forge on..sometimes for  better..sometimes for worse.  This is a heart-rending book....portraying  the plight of children and adults adjusting to new families, new settings,  new everything..and always expected to do it with a smile.  Joanna Trollope  is a GREAT writer.	1999-09-08
