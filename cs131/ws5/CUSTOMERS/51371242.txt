I've got more stickies and highlights in this set than all other Access books combined.  So when I came across the Access cookbook and realized that the same two indispensible authors (Getz & Litwin) put together a resource of Access developer solutions, I had to have it. <br /> <br />This book has not let me down.  It is certainly geared towards the intermediate to advanced Access professional developers who already understand the basics of Access and more importantly, who also understand the shortcomings of Access and the benefits of getting around those shortcomings.  There are about 170 solutions in this book that are segmented into 18 chapters of high-level topics such as Queries, Forms, XML, UI, VBA, Windows APIs, even Smart Tags.  I would be really surprised to find someone who picked up this text, thumbed through the solutions, and found that there was nothing they could get out of this book. <br /> <br />I would say that if you are developing a professional Access front-end and/or database, you owe it to yourself to buy this book and review each solution before you release or ship your product.  I did, and found either new answers and existing improvements to many of the things I was struggling with during my development cycles.	2005-05-21

Unfortunately, this was a mistake.  Note that unlike the other reviewer, I am not comparing Rough Guide to Lonely Planet; I have not had a chance to use Lonely Planet Portugal.    On the positive side, unlike Rick Steves', the book is quite comprehensive and covers many different cities across Portugal, including my favorite hilltop town of Marvao. The maps are generally good and accurate as to where streets, accommodations, restaurants, tourist information, and bars are located. I also really enjoy the \\"40 things not to miss\\" in the front of the book, complete with pictures. Good history section on Portugal as well.    However, my negative experiences with this book on the road outweigh these positives. Here are some examples:    I was in Evora with an hour to go before my bus left and while on the town, I needed to know (1) where I could exchange my traveler's cheques without paying an arm and a leg and if I couldn't do this, (2) does my pensao take credit cards?  This book was not able to provide either information!  There was zero exchange or bank information either written on Evora or on the map, and no credit card information provided for any of the accommodations. I would point out that Evora is one of the more frequented cities in Portugal, and certainly the hub of the Alentejo region.  I walked back to my pensao without exchanging, only to find they did not accept credit cards.  I made my bus but had to do a lot more walking.    I also arrived in Fatima in the evening and the book provided no map of the town.  While it is not a gigantic town, Fatima is a very important site for Catholics and also receives tens of thousands of visitors in both May and October.  I feel a map is essential.  Tourist office was closed.  We spent an extra half hour trying to find a recommended hotel and had to ask directions several times.    I also didn't care for the organization of the Lisbon section and found it very frustrating. Here's why: Accommodation options for all sections of town are listed first. Then, for each section of the town, the guide provides the map of the section with accommodations and restaurants on the map, then goes into the sights for that section.  Finally, restaurant options for all sections of town are listed last.  I constantly had to flip back and forth 20-30 pages to find the map of the right section of town (see where it is), and then find the listing for the restaurant or accommodation (see if I want to eat or stay there).  Better organization is clearly needed, and the restaurants and accommodations for a single section needed to be in the same section where the map is given.    The other thing I was not happy with is putting \\"travel details\\" such as travel times between city A and city B at the very end of a section of the country. Lonely Planet usually includes this in the \\"Getting to and from\\" for each city, and it is clearly better.    One more road tested problem: Portuguese-English translations are in the back of the book but I couldn't find how to say \\"coffee with milk\\" when I really needed to in a caf.  I later discover the translation is in the \\"guide to coffee\\" section in a different part of the book.  Not helpful, needs to be in both.  Same problem with ordering red wine, white wine, beer, in a restaurant.    I can't speak whether these organization problems are consistent across Rough Guides, but they were very troublesome during my time in Portugal.  It just seems like they didn't actually test it out themselves on the road.  I would recommend another option over this book, or at least have another book as your primary guide and this as secondary for additional restaurant or accommodation options.I would also always recommend that you see if a DK Eyewitness Guide is available, as is the case for Portugal.  I love DK Eyewitness Guides for the pictures, history, information about sights, and also the restaurant and accommodation options when you want to splurge a little more.    Now a couple of other quick tips if you are considering a trip to Portugal: the pousadas are lovely places to stay and the staff is unbelievably helpful.  The Barrio Alto region of Lisbon is an amazing place for all kinds of different ethnic restaurants, packed in a tight little area.  I come from the world of trains across the rest of Europe, but the buses are always faster and more frequent in Portugal.  Sintra, Obidos, and Marvao are must sees, the latter being somewhat hard to get to.	2005-02-16
US	51371242	RVD5EBY9RWRGF	1566914116	571971785	Moon Handbooks South Pacific	Books	5	43	43	N	N	The authoritative resource on the South Pacific	This is a big book... a really big book!  It weighs in at over 1,000 pages and in my opinion, is the most comprehensive book on the South Pacific.  It is definitely geared more toward the island hopper and/or complete South Pacific traveler, as there are individual books on the different islands available. <br /> <br />I'm not sure how this title relates to the Lonely Planet South Pacific (I'd consider these two as the leading authoritative sources), but I chose Moon over Lonely Planet because (1) there are 250+ more pages in Moon, and (2) this guide has been out from Moon for 8 editions, since 1979, compared to 2 editions for Lonely Planet.  I haven't been let down by this book. <br /> <br />As expected, there are two substantially large chapters devoted to French Polynesia and Fiji.  The 13 other islands are also covered in great detail (for example, about 80 pages dedicated to Vanuatu!) <br /> <br />Whereas I consider Lonely Planet guides to be more for the frugal traveler or backpacker, Moon covers a wide variety of accommodations, anywhere from $250 and night and up, down to your basic bungalow.  This is helpful because let's face it, in some places I want to splurge for the overwater bungalow!  I'd also comment that Moon is a great choice for the active traveler.  There are tremendous sections on how to find kayaking, scuba, and surfing tours. <br /> <br />For most people, a guide on a single country or island is going to suffice.  However, if you are planning or dreaming of a trip to multiple islands across the South Pacific, I'd take this guide as it has certainly been around the longest and is the most comprehensive choice out there.	2005-01-03

There are obviously other choices out there on the marketplace such as Lonely Planet, but I've always felt that David Stanley's Moon Handbooks are a step above the competition because the guide is written by someone who has actually lived there long enough to really know the in's and out's of each place.  I've used guidebooks to find some highly recommended restaurants and had a terrible experience there, and I've found hole-in-the-wall places that aren't covered by the guidebook and had a wonderful experience.  I think this is a result of a guidebook writer having only visited each place once and basing a recommendation on one experience, rather than really settle down and get to know each place.  The latter is the sense I received when I bought and read Moon Handbooks Tahiti.<br />Much like the Fiji Moon Handbooks guide, considerable attention is given to the history, culture and people of the area.  While this history may appeal to only certain people, let's put it this way... other areas are not spared in exchange for this information, so consider it a bonus over other guidebooks.  The real structure of the book, such as the places to stay, places to eat, and activities on each of the islands is as good if not better than I've seen in better-known guidebooks.  Furthermore, the maps are unsurpassed starting at entire islands right on down to city centers.<br />I often take more than one guidebook on a trip to a destination anyway, but if my budget or my backpack only allowed one, this would be the one for Tahiti.  Hope my review helps you plan for your trip.  Bon voyage!	2003-12-09

I don't want to rehash the premise of the book or tell you specifics of what you'll find within the chapters.  Reviewers have already done that.  However, having just finished this book and being blown away at how incredible scientists are and how complex the history of our world truly is, I felt that I must share my two cents.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  I come away with a new appreciation for my high school biology and chemistry teachers, two subjects I absolutely despised at the time.  Thanks to Bryson, I can revisit these subjects among others as an adult and see them in a truly different light.  Thank you for your three years of hard and diligent work, Mr. Bryson.	2003-11-14

We visited Yvoire in mid-June and although the town received some tourists throughout the day, my wife and I spent the night in Yvoire and I couldn't pick out one other tourist in the town. It was our favorite place in all of Europe.<br />Sure enough, this book dedicates two entire pages to Yvoire.  I had to get this book to look for other French villages we should visit on our next trip! The book is divided up by sections of France (Normandy, Brittany, etc.), and although some pictures look like they are taken in November or March, when I would LEAST want to visit France, most of the pictures are visually pleasing and the village write-up's compliment well.<br />Given its price, this book gets five stars in my opinion. I've already got my list of new villages to visit on our next trip!	2003-09-10

As a future traveler to Croatia, I needed a book to help me with where to stay, where to eat and where to go for nightlife.  For that, I looked to the Rough Guide Croatia (search on 1858285445) and Lonely Planet Croatia (search on 1864503327). These books have lots of text and lots of information! However, when I wanted a guide that explains the history of Croatia, detailed information on each sight that I'm visiting, and great pictures to boot, that's when I picked up this book.  It does have a restaurant and accomodation section, but it's pretty small.  I wouldn't rely solely on this book to plan your stay in Croatia...	2003-05-29

They update their website theonion.com  every Wednesday, and I'm always there.  Now you can get some of their \\"greatest hits\\" in the form of this book.  It is important to note that you won't find every article in this book on their website, and that really supports the argument to get this book.<br />Be sure to check out \\"Congress Holds Weekend Trust-Building Retreat\\", \\"Supportive Gay Friend to Counsel American People on Ways of Romance\\", and \\"Hilarious Love Letter Found in Street\\" among others.  If you are brand new to the Onion, you won't find it in this book, but you could search on the Internet for \\"Holy...!, Man Walks on ... Moon\\".  That's really a great place to start.<br />One other thing to note -- rather than just get this book, there is also a 3-pack of Onion books.  They really aren't priced much more than this book.  It's called \\"The Onion Platinum Prestige Encore Gold Premium Collector's Collection\\" and the ISBN is 1400049059.	2003-01-18

I wanted to get certified in Access for personal benefit and to see how much I knew.  A few weeks before the exam, I changed my mind and actually registered for the Access XP exam instead.  It is very easy to pass the Access XP exam even if you are an Access 2000 user.  I passed today with an 889.  Besides approximately three years of experience with Access 97/2000, I used this book as my primary resource.<br />I can't emphasize enough the importance of knowing the application and being comfortable with everything from creating relationships to filtering data in a query based on criteria.  This book supplemented my experience with some very good exercises.  Even if you know how to do a lot of the exercises contained within, do them again and do them in the most effective way.  It will help your score on the exam.  Unfortunately, I can't compare this book to the others out there on the market because I only used this one.  However, I was happy that this book was very exercise-heavy and the entire exam was doing the same types of things I practiced using the book.<br />Overall, the exam was quite easy, especially if you have years of experience in Access and/or have taken more technical Microsoft cert tests.  This was a breeze compared to the Networking Essentials and Windows NT Workstation administration tests.	2002-10-31

Lonely Planet has to be my favorite series of travel books, and this edition is right on par with their other guides.<br />One goal of mine has been to stay in B&amp;B's the whole time (I picture lots of intimate Atlantic oceanside places), and there is a good focus on these accommodations.  Another increasing trend in the LP series has been to supplement with web addresses for more information.  The author looks like they have gone to great lengths to provide an extraordinary number of links for accommodations, activities, visitor info and often, restaurants.  Coverage of maps (including city) and suggested itineraries are two of my favorite aspects of Lonely Planet, and this guide has great ones.  This book also doubles as a history primer for the area.  Two easy-read examples within that I enjoyed included background on the New Brunswick-to-PEI bridge &amp; the history of why Halifax gives a Christmas tree to Boston each year.<br />Overall, there is more information contained within than I could use while visiting the area. It's simply the best choice for visiting the Maritimes.<br />One last note, Lonely Planet also released a full guide on Quebec as well.	2002-09-16

The author separates the Polynesian island chains into different sections, giving complete coverage to history, accomodations, food (including cooking local cuisine), getting there, getting around and more for each island.  The maps are simply spectacular, starting with the entire region (including air travel routes) all the way down to individual island and primary city maps.  In fact, individual maps even have exact, pinpointed hotel and attraction locations, an extremely useful reference during your actual trip.<br />The Tahiti handbook also contains useful background on this region.  Topics include the coral reefs of the Pacific, typhoons, Tahiti's climate, plants, animals and local customs.  Show me another guidebook that has such unique content like Polynesian dance diagrams or instructions how to buy a black pearl.<br />The book concludes with a complete bibliography, related Internet web pages and some useful direct email addresses of contacts in the region.  Overall, I highly recommend this guide book to anyone planning a trip to Tahiti/French Polynesia, Easter Island or the Cook Islands.	2001-10-04

However, if someone needed my recommendation for only one book, Foxall's &quot;MCSD in a Nutshell&quot; would be it.  Unlike many other MCSD books, Foxall doesn't spend any time insulting professional VB programmers with beginner VB details (which, believe it or not, is what some MCSD books do in their first chapters).  On page 9, he's already describing how to display a pop-up menu during program runtime.  He assumes that if you need a beginner's tutorial, you shouldn't even be thinking about these exams.<br />The book begins with a table dividing the skills &amp; technologies tested on these two exams, the way every certification book should begin.  Foxall's treatment of COM and ActiveX is outstanding.  In fact, I learned more in the 38-page COM chapter than I did in all of Wrox's VB COM book.  The chapters on &quot;Packaging &amp; Deployment&quot; &amp; &quot;Visual SourceSafe&quot; are also noteworthy, primarily because other books skimp on these topics while Microsoft still heavily tests on them.<br />A final note: people will be drawn to this book mainly for help passing the MCSD exams.  Let's not downplay the usefulness of this book as an excellent Visual Basic resource for advanced VB programmers.	2001-10-03

My first smoothie book was decent, it was Super Smoothies: 50 Recipes for Health and Energy ISBN 081182540X.  I was a little disappointed with this book.  I knew from the title it would only have 50 recipes, but the money I was paying for this book really wasn't going towards recipes, but to the fancy design of the book and tons of pictures of the smoothies.<br />I decided for my second smoothie book, I was doing away with the pictures and going for as many recipes as possible.  When I stumbled across this book for about half the price and FIFTEEN TIMES the number of recipes (including shakes and frappes), I was in heaven.<br />All recipes include complete nutritional analysis (so you know how good or bad it is for you!).  Drinks are divided into alphabetical listings.  Here are a few samples of the drinks in this book:  Pineapple-Mint Sour, Fuzzy Pink Splash, Kiwi Quencher, and Chocolate-Raspberry Shake.

I ended up purchasing Smoothies, Shakes &amp; Frappes ISBN 1579121721 for about half the price and, with no disrespect to these authors, found this to be a better choice if it really is quantity of smoothie and shake recipes you are looking for.	2001-08-19

I mean the bulk of these examples were written in Pascal or Fortran and Visual Basic, my main development tool, wasn't even available yet.  Why should a hardcore VB programmer get this book?<br />I forced myself to get it because I think it's important to read the &quot;classics&quot; and because I was almost curious as to how it could get such great reviews.  I haven't regretted it.  There is such a diverse presentation of coding techniques and suggestions that it doesn't matter if it's in C, Basic, Pascal or Fortran.  While I usually get a programming book that applies to one specific language, program or topic, this book is language independent.  Perhaps that's why almost everyone unanimously agrees that this book is still extremely useful.<br />I would agree that this book would be considered most useful for new programmers, but I guarantee that any programmer or software engineer can learn something new from this book.  There are too many good suggestions and principles contained within not to.  Pick it up and see what everyone's STILL raving about 8+ years later.	2001-08-10

I'm the kind of person that needs some background on a story or saga if it exists. I wanted to read the original book to gain some insight in to Pierre Boulle's &quot;Planet&quot; before I saw the 2001 version. I'm really glad that I did. For the most part, this book is very different except for a few small details and the surprise ending (the ending in the book is the same as the ending in the 2001 movie -- with one extra little twist in the book). True this story is considered science fiction, but I think it is less science fiction as it is animal and human behavioral sciences and philosophical issues associated with the situation.<br />If you've seen the 60's movie, you probably won't care about this book but if you are like me and didn't know the story of the &quot;Planet&quot;, definitely get this book before seeing the 2001 version.

Using a report's NoData event to display a message that there is no data in a report rather than returning or printing a blank report.<BR> 3. Sorting &amp; grouping a report on the fly by asking the user how they want to group or sort, then do it with code.<BR> 4. An incredible section on how to dynamically optimize the application's screen resolution based on the user's screen size, complete with code you can paste and use!<BR><br />There are plenty more that I could add but I assume you get the picture!  If you are very comfortable with Access, you need this book to complete your library and call yourself an Access Master!	2001-07-16

Because that's the biggest knock I've heard regarding this book.  Some people are reading each chapter and coming away saying &quot;well that's obvious.&quot;  Folks, there isn't anything groundbreaking about this book.  There isn't some type of genius method of instantly transforming your life around.  It was written decades ago but the solid principles still apply today.  For example, if you want to add years to your life, take a nap for an hour each day.  Carnegie is then going to tell you exactly who did this and how it helped them transform their life.  Read this book once, then twice, then a third time and start living these principles.  They are simple but effective and they will, as the title implies, help you start living your life.	2001-06-18

That's the bio of David Stanley, the author of this book and this guy knows the in's and out's of Fiji.  That's obvious when you pick up this book.<br />Fiji Handbook starts out with the most comprehensive background of Fiji I've found in competitive books, everything ranging from its history (including cannabalism!) right down to the shark population around the island.  I always like to prime up on the place I'm traveling and this section is great for it.<br />The next section, a Fiji &quot;overview&quot; is very informative.  It covers the basics such as getting to/from the island, communicating off the island, and accomodations around Fiji (like camping vs. hotels).  This is pretty standard in any guidebook.<br />The meat of the book comes afterwards, which is broken down by island chains.  It covers everything you would expect, including accomodations, hotels, beaches and attractions.  Maps are outstanding -- not only do they have island maps, but major city maps too with post offices, restaurants and sights discussed in the text are labelled on the map.<br />This was the first book by Moon Handbooks I have read and I will surely consider more.  My recommendation is to give this title serious consideration	2001-05-17

Therefore, it reads like a training course.  Each chapter contains material relevant to the current training week, and it does go over the very important topics of stretching, carbs &amp; hydration.  It does not concern the reader with improving marathon times, it tells you simply HOW TO FINISH.  Of the 200 people that have taken this course, 199 ran their first marathon and there was a wide range of athletic skill among those people.  Putting it simple, THIS BOOK WORKS.	2001-04-17

I've learned so much about a number of topics from IRAs to wills, credit unions to buying my first house mortgage.  Consumer Reports provides great statistical data to back up their suggestions or findings (for example, different compounding results for loans vs. leases).  They don't just provide definitions for each topic, they give helpful, advanced suggestions and advice (for example, a regular IRA will compound much more than a Roth IRA because a Roth IRA gets taxes pulled out of it right at the contribution).  I guess the younger you are, the more I can recommend this book.  Anyone who is just breaking in to the real world will find this book extremely valuable.  Everyone else will at least find further insight to topics they might already know about and also get their money's worth from the book.	2001-03-21

The author assumes you already know how to do your basic return and he means this by barely giving any introduction.  The author wants to help maximize your deductions by having you reference individual sections on how to report those deductions.  It's massive and it contains all kinds of tips on what to do on your return under certain conditions.  It follows this type of convention: 6.21 Reporting Gambling Losses or 7.5 Deducting Mortgage Interest.  Therefore you don't read this book front to back, and people filing 1040EZ's or (unless it's complex) perhaps a 1040A won't use very much of this book, only certain parts relevant to them.<br />This book has some great information.  I located where I needed to send my return in a matter of seconds with this book as opposed to the IRS pamphlet which I still haven't found the address.  In addition, it creates a great, one-page table to help you decide what return to file (1040, A, or EZ).  It was the first thing I had seen that conclusively summed up exactly which one I should file.<br />In a one sentence summary, if you are dead set on doing your own taxes, the more complex your taxes are, the more you will use this reference book.	2001-03-01

My best suggestion is really think about why you want this book. I bought it because I'm primarily a Visual Basic programmer and I had been working with XML over the web, and I wanted to pick up this book and see what ideas these authors had for integrating XML in to their VB app projects.  I wasn't working on a relevant project myself and that was part of the reason I lost interest in this book so fast.  <br />This book definitely is not for beginners of Visual Basic and in fact, I would definitely suggest having some prior knowledge of XML even though the first two chapters provide a quick intro to XML.  Perhaps this isn't a comment so much about the book as it is about using XML in VB, but having to learn and use the Microsoft XML DOM 3.0 library reference within Visual Basic meant there were tons of examples and lots and lots of code to type up.  In fact, the authors actually create a VB program that parses XML code and it is somewhere along the lines of 10 pages of code! <br />This book has its moments, I liked the sample application chapter to see how it all tied together and if you love examples, you will see TONS of them throughout this book -- if you are familiar with Wrox, half the text in this book is in grey shading (meaning code example).  But overall, as other reviewers have also pointed out, it covers a great deal of stuff without doing one particular thing exceptionally well (sample application withstanding).  If your boss has definitely said &quot;Mix XML into your VB app!&quot;, this book is probably your best choice.  But if there was one thing I learned from this book, it's that I'd rather continue to use XML over the web than in my desktop or distributed VB applications right now.	2001-02-15

Forget about the fact that this isn't put out by a well-known computer-related publishing house like Wrox or O'Reilly. Forget about the fact that it isn't a &quot;Learn in 21 Days&quot; or &quot;Bible&quot; series.  Forget about that, as I write this, only a few people have reviewed this book.  This book is flat out awesome.  Get it.<br />I am a VB programmer with about 1 1/2 years of experience.  I started off with a basic VB book, moved on to using VB with databases, and it was at this point I started realizing how important objects were.  I needed to separate my client projects from much of the code behind the scenes and put that code in to Active DLL's or EXE's so many different client projects could access it over many different methods (desktop, distributed over our network, or through the Internet).  I mean that's the power of VB!  I bought &quot;VB COM&quot; by Wrox and while it taught me some things, it was really just an overview.  I also bought &quot;VB Beginning Objects&quot; by Smiley but it was too basic and written more like a 700-page novel.  They both had decent examples of objects at work, but neither of those books were good references.  I guess the best way to describe my situation after reading these two books was that I knew what objects were, I knew the basics of programming them, and yet I still couldn't apply what I learned to the current stuff I was working on at my job.  That's when I knew I needed more.<br />Along comes this book and I now feel like I am a full fledged VB object programmer.  There's none of this &quot;Here's how you write a Select Case within an object&quot;... the author cuts right to the chase starting at Chapter 1, page 1.  Within the first five pages, I already had the author discuss some of the main issues I was concerned and thinking about-- ie, &quot;It seems the more flexible you want to make your object methods, the more parameters you have to pass to them.&quot;  I was impressed.  Already something I was thinking about in my current project.<br />There are 16 chapters covered, beginning chapters on designing, coding the objects, and COM interfaces, advanced chapters on COM Add-In's To ActiveX Objects, Deploying to ActiveX Documents.  There's a great chance that if a certain topic involves objects, this book has at least a mention of that topic.  This has been the best programming book I've bought in awhile and I will without a doubt explore more books by this publisher and author.	2001-02-08

First off, let me start by saying the cover of this book shown is misleading.  This is the cover for the larger, atlas-size, hard cover version of Geographicas World Reference.  The cover is really blue with the outline of the globe, not green with a topographical map as shown.  Don't be misled thinking that this book is big, because it isn't.  More on that in a sec.<br />I'm a huge geography/travel buff and when I first skimmed through this book I knew I had to have it.  It starts off by discussing Planet Earth as it relates to the universe and as a habitat for man.  Following this, it moves on to people and society -- ie: evolution, health, languages.  Both sections are written much like an encyclopedia, complete with pictures, statistics and timelines.  Then comes my favorite part of the book.  Every country in the world is treated, from 11 pages of the United States right down to 1.7 sq. mile Jarvis Island on the Equator.  Most countries have beautiful pictures and all have useful reference facts - capitals, area, time zone, population, climate, currency.  Finally there are maps divided up by region that show these countries, their cities, rivers, mountains and so forth.<br />Okay, perhaps this book IS a lot like an encyclopedia.  But it's much more compact.  It would make a great reference to a library or, if you're like me and you love geography and/or traveling, you can brush up on your world capitals or read &amp; dream about all the places you want to visit.	2001-02-07

But this book is more useful as starter paper for a fire.  Shame on Webster's for publishing a book.<br />Here is why it stinks.  Whenever I would hear, think or find a word that I didn't know, I would go to this book to get the defintion.  Sound reasonable enough?  Almost every time, my words aren't even in here.  It's like they skipped over so many important words in the English language so they would be able to fit this book down to less than 400 pages.  This book would be better for a non-English speaker who occasionally has to look up words such as 'locust', 'ledger', and the like.  It's too basic.  Don't get this book and expect to learn tough words, because if you are a native English speaker like I am, it's worth the extra money to buy a more expensive, 1,500 page comprehensive dictionary.  Heed this review and save yourself money from buying this.	2001-01-25

I had spent a semester abroad and learned the joys of Indian food from Govinda's.  On their shelf was this book, and it was the book that closest fit the food I had been eating there for the last four months.  Now that I am back home in the states, I always get a taste of Govinda's when I cook one of the many true Indian dishes such as Sesame Yogurt Potatoes or Mung Dal soup with tomatoes.  Here are a few suggestions if thinking about buying this book: make sure you have availability to unique, ethnic grocery stores or you can find close substitutes because many foods and spices used in this book are very unique.  In addition, each recipes calls for many many ingredients so don't get this book if you are hoping to make quick, painless Indian meals.  Look elsewhere.  Having said that, if you want true cuisine of India, this is the book.	2001-01-25

You want to develop your own, either using straight Notepad or possibly a software development tool such as FrontPage, Dreamweaver, or Homesite. However, despite what these tools can do, you want to know about HTML.<br />THE BOOK: As introductory as it gets for HTML.  It starts you off at the roots: let's sort through all these web technologies you hear about: XML, CSS, etc.  But don't worry too much about those.  Here's what HTML is: tags, spacing, designing, etc.  How do you go about planning and designing your website, then look at it in a browser?  How can I create and add images, create links, lists of information, tables, frames and forms to my web page.  How can I use Cascading Style Sheets, a way to provide a consistent look throughout multiple pages of my website?  Each page provides an example of both the code and the webpage screenshot of the HTML being put to use in a page.  Toss in a specular appendix that suggests HTML tools and more importantly, Colors in Hex (hint: learn what web safe colors are as soon as you decide to design a web page!) and you have this book.

If you are new to the language, do not purchase this book expecting to learn how to program.  You already know your If..Then..Else and Select Case statements.  What this book does is give you a quick reference to find that date function that you have never used or remind you the exact syntax of a Property Set procedure.<br />The bulk of the book (80-85%) is the language reference alphabetized and some appendices dividing the language reference up by other methods, such as similar functions/methods, data types, operators, etc.  Chapter 4 &quot;Class Modules&quot; contains a concise, 20-page refresher on how to object-orient your VB with classes.  I had studied a few other books on OOP VB but still don't have it down pat, this chapter will be my guide until I can do classes in my sleep.  Very little covered on API functions but also a great section on ActiveX (creating,  registering, unregistering, Controls, EXE vs. DLLs).<br />Probably the biggest question I faced was: &quot;Why get this book when I have an MSDN subscription at work?&quot;  This book is supposed to pick up where that takes off.  I hate searching through the whole MSDN for one method.  It can take forever.  Plus, this book will travel with me.<br />On a side note, I'm studying for my MCSD and this book has been very valuable.  From my past experience with Microsoft exams, you never know when you are going to get a specific question about a particular function, property and method and have to know the default value, or which property would not belong to an object.  If you have never used it before, you'll have no idea. It's no fun to actually &quot;study&quot; such a reference book, but this book is very detailed and comprehensive about what everything does and how it could be used.  I know the more I thumb through this thing, the better the chance I have of nailing a question on a test.   Would make a great complimentary book to the MCSD VB exams 70-156 and 70-155.	2001-01-19

If you aren't familiar with Wrox Publishing (great books!), Wrox has a learning tree on the back of most of their books.  It helps developers determine the appropriate path and books to read to learn a specific technology.  As a developer, I can't stress the importance of this enough.  I therefore feel it's important to suggest that while this is a Beginning ASP book, you should have some experience coding straight Active Server Pages (no database stuff) and if you like Wrox, I highly suggest Beginning Active Server Pages 2.0 or 3.0 (I reviewed 2.0 if you need help determining which version book to get).  If I hadn't gone through Beginning ASP 2.0 before doing this book, I wouldn't have gotten as much out of it.  This is because the author immediately dives in to ADO in Chapter 3, assuming you are ASP-ready!<br />Having said that, this is a great book.  I was familiar with Microsoft data access techniques (ADO, Jet, SQL language) and a little with ASP but I really needed a book to see how they all tied together.  The author goes through SQL as does most any database book, but at least he uses it in the context of integrating with your ASP web pages.  A great part of this book is showing how you would actually implement recordsets.  In other words, he doesn't say &quot;Here's how to bring back recordsets&quot;, he says &quot;Here's how to bring back recordsets and display the information usefully in an ASP page&quot;.  Cookies, Errors, Stored Procedures, and a full case study are all presented in later chapters.  The case study was extremely helpful.<br />One other thing I think you may find helpful-- don't feel left out if you are only developing on a workstation with no server right now.  You can still use this book.  Chapter 2 is dedicated solely to showing how you can work with this entire book using/installing Personal Web Server, IIS, ADO on any Microsoft operating system, including Windows 95/98, 2000, Or NT with no server involved.	2001-01-12

It would have been very easy to keep Iceland, Faroe Islands separate, the Baltic States separate, and a St. Petersburg city guide in a different book or just with Lonely Planet Russia.  <br />Besides the fact that the area it covers is very comprehensive, here's why I like this book over others.  Lonely Planet does a great job covering budget options for food, hostels/pensions/hotels, and activities.  The city maps are extremely comprehensive.  For example, there are exact points for each place to stay, place to eat, and other important landmarks (train station, post office, bus station, sights, etc.) in each city map.  How easy is that!  In addition, Lonely Planet is the best guide to cover how to get there, get around, and get away.  I find that many guides only assume you are getting around by Eurail or bus.  And unlike other guides that treat only the major cities and outlying areas (Frommers, for example), Lonely Planet is just as concerned with telling you where to find the smaller, less-crowded parts of Scandinavia and Baltic Europe (Norway's fjords, Iceland's hot springs, etc.)  Without a doubt, get this book.	2001-01-06

The guide includes point-to-point trail directions, specific maps, driving directions, facility information, and the usual historical fun facts that always fill hiking books.<br />I grew up in New Hampshire and now live in Vermont.  To find this book that covers both of my outdoor winter playgrounds was a true find.  If you are a big outdoorsy person looking for a guide to places to help you with winter activities, this book by Marty Basch will be a welcome addition to your library or backpack.	2000-12-26
US	51371242	R2KSBM34NGEOYP	0764532367	869971643	XML Bible	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Great beginning XML book	This book comes highly recommended for someone who may or may not know about XML but has very little idea how to understand it or start writing their own XML.  One word of caution, please remember that with such a new technology this book can become outdated very quickly.  You may become frustrated with the examples and/or code as the technology changes.<br />The author's main example works with baseball statistics throughout the book.  The book begins by introducing XML.  It shows what XML looks like, how other technologies surrounding XML (CSS, XSL) fit together, various versions of XML (like the Chemical Markup Language) and building your first XML document with the standard 'Hello World!' example.  Next comes the meat of the book.  The author discusses how to effectively structure your XML using elements and attributes.  He shows what is proper and improper XML structure and briefly shows how XSL can format your XML.<br />The author spends quite a bit of time on Document Type Definitions (DTD's) which help you validate your XML.  Please note that because this book is a bit outdated, the author does not treat Schema's, which are increasingly becoming popular as an alternative to DTD's  (A great book that discusses DTD's vs. Schemas is Wrox's VB6 XML).  After DTD's, we get an in-depth look at transforming your XML using both Cascading Style Sheets and XSL.  XSL formatting is also treated.<br />To finish the text, the author looks at what he calls &quot;supplemental technologies&quot; to XML - XLinks (like HTML hyperlinks for XML), XPointers (addresses specific parts of XML document) and namespaces (differentation between formatting and data in your XML/XSL) and the more advanced part of this book, XML applications where you would actually use your XML now that you have figured out how to write it.<br />The book is a great introduction to XML and it does what it promises, it gets you up-to-speed on XML and has you writing your own documents right away.	2000-12-20

However, Access 97 is getting outdated and this review is whether or not you should upgrade to Access 2000 books.  The answer is yes.  Here's why.<br />If you do not have Access 2000 and are thinking about this book because you only have Access or Office 97, I HIGHLY suggest getting Access 2000 Bible anyways.  Access 2000 really hasn't changed much from Access 97, and most of the things that have changed do not apply to a beginner's book, which I would consider this to be.  The menu commands and basics of database design, tables, queries, forms and reports have not drastically changed between Access 97 and 2000.  You can get away with using a 2000 book if you are still on 97.<br />Having said that, if you have either finished this book or are looking for the &quot;next step&quot; Access book to use after this one, please check out &quot;Access 2000 Developer's Handbook Volume 1: Desktop Edition&quot;, ISBN 0782123708.  It is a great follow-up, intermediate Access user's book.	2000-12-19

Books	4	16	16	N	N	Comprehensive hiking book for the right price	The fifth edition of this book, written by two members of the Green  Mountain Club, covers hikes everywhere in the State.  To no one's surprise,  the majority are located along the Appalachian trail and the area with the  least hikes covered is in the Northeast Kingdom.<br />The authors offer a very  good &quot;At A Glance&quot; section in the beginning with hike name,  location, and so forth-- many of the things also covered in the individual  hikes, but what stands out in this secion is whether or not each hike has a  view, good for kids, nearby camping, good for winter, and my personal fav,  notes that state whether the hike is good for x-c skiing, snowshoeing,  waterfalls, historical interest, etc.  The book also contains a  &quot;hiker's&quot; guide to trail map symbols, safety, what the pack and  more.<br />There are no surprises in the write-up for each hike.  The authors  have not left anything out: distance, hiking time, vertical rise,  difficulty rating, pictures and topographical maps.<br />You won't find a  better book about hiking in Vermont for this reasonable price.	2000-09-16

I was forced to buy this in my very first  Introduction to Visual Basic programming.  My best advice for people  interested in buying this book is make sure you are an absolute beginner to  VB programming.  Anyone with previous experience will find this book  extremely dry.  Even after developing Visual Basic for a year and a half, I  still use this book as a reference when I'm reverting back to some of the  basics of VB programming.  Every possible beginning VB topic is covered,  from Input Boxes to Message Boxes, If..Then..Else cases to Select cases.   Enjoy.	2000-09-07
US	51371242	R1A1ZB8O96BVY9	1861003129	989194807	XSLT Programmer's Reference	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Hands down the best book available on XSL	First things first, this is one of the only books out there on XSL/XSLT.  You've got to give a book praise when it is one of the few available in the field.  This is not a beginner's book, but for intermediate XML/XSL  programmers.<br />I have the XML Bible but like most books on XML, they only  treat XSLT/XSLF with a chapter or two.  I was getting sick of formatting my  XML using the most basic XSL commands available and that's what these XML  books were offering.  Solution: book on XSL!  I wanted to learn how to make  my formatted XML more dynamic, more functionable in the browser.<br />The book  does start on a slightly XSL beginner's note.  It goes over XSLT's  background (probably cases for XSL over CSS) and the structure of an XSL  stylesheet.  From here, it goes in to a nice, 200-page XSL element  reference with more transforming element tags than you can shake a stick  at.  After a chapter on Expressions, my two favorite chapters on Patterns  &amp; Functions show the real power of XSL.  The book concludes with a  chapter on Design Patterns (probably help you organize your XSL code more  functionally), Worked Examples (not enough books have these contained  within!), and XML/XSL-related products.<br />Make sure you have some XML  background first!  Maybe that goes without saying, but I'll still offer  Wrox's Professional XML as a primer.  Please keep in mind that this XSLT  book is an 800-page reference with a tiny tutorial section on XSL.  If you  are relatively new to XSL and want the basics, you are better off getting  your info on the web [...] and when you've got  those XSL offerings down, then go to this reference!	2000-08-25
US	51371242	R28YIGM3GXIYT	1565927095	35616237	XML Pocket Reference: Extensible Markup Language	Books	3	6	7	N	Y	Who is this book aimed at?	Before buying this book, question yourself: how much XML do I really know?   If you are a relative newbie to XML, this pocket reference doesn't go into  enough detail to really get you up-to-speed on the inner-workings of XML  (like DTD's, XSL stylesheets).  If you know XML pretty well, those bigger,  thicker books you used to learn XML are going to be more in-depth than this  reference and will contain the same information, just more of it to thumb  through.<BR><BR><br />I bought this pocket reference along with Harold's XML  Bible.  The XML Bible may be 1,000 pages, but it has the same information  as the pocket reference and an index, so it's just as easy for me to look  up a topic among those 1,000 pages.  I gave the book three stars because it  does summarize XML quite well, I just can't seem to figure out who the  intended audience is.	2000-08-10
US	51371242	R22CPBS7QE5RUS	007882396X	287090956	Oracle8: The Complete Reference	Books	4	1	2	N	N	It's a huge book!... and it's pretty good	This book covers several things extremely well: Oracle 8 and relational databasing.  It is not the book you want to get if you are looking for in-depth help with the SQL query language.  The authors use the example of  old, paper records back in the 1800's and how they could have improved  storage of these records by using an Oracle database today.  I liked the  example throughout because once you understand the thinking behind these  paper records, it was much easier to understand the complex database  concepts.<br />There are several parts to the book.  This is how they are  broken up: Critical Databse concepts, SQL From Beginner to Expert (I think  this section is a little over-inflated, I don't think it really makes you a  SQL expert), the Hitchhiker's Guide to Oracle8 Data Dictionary, Designing  for Productivity and an alphabetical reference (I like this  section!)<br />Basic database concepts are covered extremely well: triggers,  stored queries, stored procedures, SQLPLUS, etc.<br />For advanced database  gurus, there are sections on object-oriented concepts, snapshots, and other  advanced topics such as large objects and ConText.<br />I can't give it four  stars-- even though it's a reference, it's still way to dry of a read and  if it's missing one thing, it's solid, in-depth examples.  However, it's  big and pretty comprehensive for the price you're gonna pay.	2000-07-18
US	51371242	RWNHOWKLUEPT1	1565924940	12828351	Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Don't let &quot;Dynamic HTML&quot; title fool you... it's got more!	The most important thing I can stress in my review is that this book is a reference.  If you are new to programming, I would suggest getting more of a tutorial-based book.  If you've done any work with HTML, scripting  languages, and/or object-oriented programming, you won't believe how handy  this book is.<br />This book is not just Dynamic HTML.  The text is divided in  to 5 different reference sections: Applying Dynamic HTML, HTML reference,  DOM (Document Object Model), CSS reference &amp; JavaScript reference.  In  fact, I'm trying to learn JavaScript and I almost feel that the JS  reference contained within this book is so good, I don't need O'Reilly's  JavaScript Definitive Guide.<br />One of the great things about this book is  the treatment of IE vs. Netscape. For example, in the HTML reference, the  author points out code syntax differences for each tag for both browsers.   In the JavaScript reference, the author uses a consistent method of telling  you after which browser version the specific object, property, and method  is supported.  Sorry if this is slightly confusing, the main thing is the  solid treatment of browser support.<br />This book is sensational.  For me,  being a VB programmer but newbie web/JavaScript programmer, there are  enough code examples within and the book is written well enough that I can  use this immediately in my job.  Highly recommended	2000-07-05

I went to school in Potsdam, New York and needed something to get me through the year.  This book did it.  Hikes are broken down even further into sections, such as Paul Smiths, Tupper Lake &amp;  Cranberry Lake.  It includes distances, alternative routes, along the way, etc... all the typical stuff in a good hiking guide.  It also includes a large topographical map of the region.  One my favorite aspects of this book is that the author lets you know which trails are great for hiking in spring/summer/fall and if these same trails are recommended for cross-country skiing in the Fall.  This book covers as far North as the boundaries of the Adirondack parks, as far West as Star Lake, as far South  as Great Sacandaga Lake, and as far East as Lake Champlain. Enjoy, it's a  great guide.	2000-06-27

It will help you to realize  that if you've programmed the basics in Visual Basic (perhaps with John  Smiley's first book), objects really aren't that much harder than what  you've been doing.  It's just a different approach.<br />All programming books  should concentrate on having the reader do examples.  The author makes sure  of that.  He works on taking a normal, working Visual Basic project and  redoing it as object-oriented.  The CD includes the files from the old  project and you re-program it object-oriented as you step through the  lessons.  There are chapters on Collection objects, manipulating Excel and  Word by using VB OOP, and creating ActiveX components.<br />The book is almost  700 pages because the author uses a &quot;classroom&quot; dialog.  He was  attempting to do two things: put it in a classroom-simulated situation and  keep it an enjoyable read (unheard of with programming books) with comments  from the class.  I like the idea, but the comments get tiresome, adding  extra fluff not needed in the book.<br />I had to get this book because of the  rave reviews and because I wanted to advance my knowledge of Visual Basic.   The book really takes off in the later chapters, just maintain the same  patience you'd have if you were sitting in a classroom and had to listen to  other people speak up.	2000-06-23

The entire book isn't just a reference to the VBScript language-- that's only about half of the book.  The reference is organized  alphabetically and contains a description, rules and usually a decent  example of the VBScript function, statement, method, etc.<br />So the surprise  is the first half of the book, and it may be important to you and it may  not.  There are 20 pages on general program structure that most every  programmer will find boring: pasing parameters by reference, passing  variables into a subroutine, etc.  After 8 more pages on data types and 22  pages on error handling/debugging, the authors included four other sections  on VBScript with Active Server Pages, Programming Outlook forms, Windows  Script Host, and VBScript with Internet Explorer.  I found these sections  to be out of the scope of what I was looking for in what O'Reilly calls a  &quot;desktop quick reference&quot; book: simply a reference to the  language.<br />I gave it four stars because the thing is only $( ) and you are  getting 500 pages.  I bought the book for the reference, even if it has  this other stuff I don't care about.  If you are programming VBScript or  ASP in Notepad without &quot;Help&quot; to consult, this may be the best  pure VBScript book out there.  It will come in handy.	2000-06-23

If I had chosen the 30 most important, relevant but not necessarily hardest questions to study, I would have spent a total of 30 minutes studying and passed with a 1000.  That was my exam.  Instead I studied so much info I  was at times confused and barely passed with a 733 of 1000.<br />So for my  particular review on this Readiness book, it was an extremely helpful  resource.  For those that do not have any other Readiness, it breaks down  Objectives by Chapter (Planning, which consists of 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 would  be Chapter 1).  That makes it easy to use in conjunction with another study  guide.  (Oh yeah, I DO NOT suggest using only this book alone to pass the  exam).  At the beginning of each chapter, it suggests terms to know before  attempting the questions.  At the end of each chapter, it suggests  exercises for practice to learn each objective (For example, read a  particular article on the Microsoft website or read Chapter 7 in the Tech  Support text).  The meat of the book is the sample questions, many of which  you'd see on the real exam.  You can work through the book answering the  questions or load the CD in your computer and it will randomly select  questions from each objective to simulate the test.  NOTE: I did not use  the CD with this particular review so check everyone else's reviews on how  helpful the CD is.<br />I didn't use the Transcender Exams,............... and are supposedly exactly like the real exam (Pass Transcender, you're  ready to take Microsoft exam).  I bought the Readiness review ......... and  still passed it.  I can only suggest you do the same.	2000-05-24

When I was on the market for an ASP book, I was torn whether or not to get 2.0, go straight to 3.0, or try my hand at a Professional 2.0 or 3.0.  I was scared away from anything 3.0 because I didn't have Win2000 and IIS  5.0.  As it turns out, I learned plenty about ASP with this book,  regardless of which Win operating system I'm on (or you are on).<br />It is  true what reviewers write below, this is a very introductory book to ASP.   It assumes you are a beginner to programming.  It also favors VBScript as  opposed to JavaScript.  But the most important part is that it is an intro  and it sets the foundation to learn more (which i would suggest ASP  Databases with Kauffman next!)<br />I had no previous ASP experience but  plenty of HTML and VBScript.  This book was a good choice for me because I  could breeze through the HTML/VB and concentrate on how to use what I knew  with ASP.  It helps you with the PWS download and gets it running (which  allows individuals to run ASP if you don't have Server of IIS).<br />It spends  a fair amount of time on the big 6 ASP objects.  However, there are a few  other really great parts to this book.  They give a few great scripts,  including one that detects browsers.  In addition, I really like the last  three chapters.  After they teach you about ASP, Ch. 13 introduces ASP with  databases (including ODBC and OLE-DB), Ch. 14 discusses the ADO model (with  SQL) and Ch. 15 integrates it all together with a big, 100-page database  classifieds example that anyone can use and manipulate to something of  their own.	2000-04-04

This book was released in 1997, which probably means it's over a decade old in IT years.  This book provides the most basic of introductions to the whole idea of e-commerce.   I think this book is good for a certain type of person.  If you fit this  description, you will benefit by reading it. You obviously have to be  interested in learning e-commerce.  Maybe you know what they are, but you  shouldn't be able to give in-depth descriptions of protocols, networking,  security or encryption.  The case studies were disappointing.  I only  really liked the Gateway one.  Again, very outdated.  The best part of the  book has to be the diagrams.  I'm a Master's IT candidate and they even  help me.  Simple with icons to represent a supplier or buyer, it's the  easiest way to describe a situation (like electronic processing using  Verisign) without giving someone a long, confusing speech on each step.   One final warning, while this book covers all these topics and concepts,  all it really does it provide definitions of them and moves on to the next  one. Perhaps information overload?	2000-03-25

There are two important parts to Dreamweaver outside of knowing HTML, which are (1) working with the Graphical Interface (ie- where to click) and (2) working  with the 'extras' such as DHTML and XML.  This book does both.  There are  three chapters on how to add multimedia to your site with stuff like  Shockwave and Flash.  There are four chapters on DHTML stuff - layers,  timelines, CSS.  Another section which I didn't use but may be helpful to  you out there is how to use Dreamweaver's web site management tools, like  FTP and site map.  No matter what kind of web publishing positioning you  are in, if you want to know Dreamweaver, get this book.	2000-02-04
