I had met him a couple of times.  He was a scholar. <br /> <br />However, A GREAT CIVIL WAR is not his best work.  Dr. Weigley was an expert on 20th Century Military and Diplomatic History.  He was also knowledgeable on the American Army.  The American Civil War was not his area of expertise.  While the text is brief, I found his frequent references to the 20th Century operational art of war out-of-context, and frankly not appropriate.  His analysis of the diplomatic aspects of the American Civil War are the best part of the book. <br /> <br />There are better books on the American Civil War.  However,  there is always something to be learned from Dr. Weigley	2005-08-05

The plot of the Story very Chandler-esque with a bit of a James Ellroy hink.    However, the heavy 'oppressed negro' theme got quite boring.<br />Mosley is a one trick pony with characters.  'Fearless Jones' is 3/4th 'Mouse' and 1/4 'Easy' from the Easy Rawlin's series.  Paris Minton is a riff on the 'Jackson Blue'(?), genius, cowardly, burglar who stole Jesus's savings character from Easy Rawlin's with a dash of Mosley himself.<br />I think the author needs to decide, which series to go forward with.  I vote for Easy Rawlin's and not more of the same in Fearless Jones.	2003-07-08

However it reads more like an ode to Ferdinand de Lesseps and could have been his biography.<br />Frankly, I believe the story would have been better told if there had been a larger discussion of the technology and management developed rather than the battle of egos that delayed the project.<br />A better story of accomplishment is A THREAD ACROSS THE OCEAN by John Steele Gordon about the first transatlantic cable.  Incidently, both projects were occuring at the same time.<br />A good filler for those interested in the politics of the French 2nd Empire, but, does not add much to those looking for the history of technology and innovation.	2003-07-02

Its a crime novel about capturing a killer that includes a lesson on kendo.  <br />The author's prose is wry and at times amusing: \\"Long Island in the summer is like the Mekong Delta, hot and humid, but with more concrete\\".  This made reading the story easier.  However, the story takes too long to develop and ends too quickly.  The Japanese characters remain very stereotypical.  Oddly, this book violates the Thriller formula, in that it has no female love interest and no sex.

However, the novel is wan and bloodless.  Ms. Ullman's prose is crisp and clean to read, but it fails to convey strong emotion.

However, he is joined by a pantheon of clichéd men and women.  Carlos's development also suffers (possibly from a lack of another 75 pages).  How quickly would you expect a civil war hardened member of the Gardia Civil who executes a Communist women with his pistol on pg. 16, start sleeping with &quot;Reds&quot; and inviting them into his home?<br />So, this novel is a good start for the author.  The period (at least in English) is underdeveloped.  However, the author has to learn how to successfully wrap-up in 30 pages, or at least don't dig the hole so deep.	2003-03-18

The main protagonist is a western businessman, the owner of a firm long established in the Middle east.  A Palestinian group threatens the man, his family, and firm to use them to strike against Israel.  The man threads a tangle of personalities, movements, obligations, and politics to preserve everything he cares about.<br />This is a good read from a historical point of view.  The author has a familiar, although now considered old-fashioned style (probably the result of much copying).    In fiction, it shows how little has changed in the Middle east in the last thirty-years.	2003-03-10

I'm hesitant to recommend it.  I liked it the same way I liked  \\"Riddle of the Sands: A Record of Secret Service\\" by Erskine Childers. \\"Riddle\\" brought to mind 1903, \\"Pattern\\" brings to mind 2003.   <br />Everything in Pattern is bleeding-edge.  Action takes place in London (just left there), Tokyo, and NYC.   The (female) main character is like `Faith Popcorn', a professional trend identifier with major phobia's.  (In the real world she would be perscribed anti-depressents.)   A media mogul assigns her a quest to find the source of mysterious, compelling film snippets (The Footage) being anonomously posted to the internet.  The Footage is getting a cult following on the internet.   There is a background plot about her ex-spook father missing in the 9/11 attack.  Beautiful people, titanium iBooks, international cell phones, e-mails and websites, cryptography, the NSA and the Russian mafia all get mulched in to solve The Footage mystery and lead to the main character's personal redemption.<br />I liked the way it was written and where/when it took place, not because the story was particularly well plotted.<BR>    <BR>So, I liked it.  But it was a better handbook on how to be cool than a techno-mystery.	2003-03-02

The story revolves around the difficulties of eventually delivering the papers.<br />As with all Ambler's books set in pre-WWII Europe its interesting to read the author's explaination of the current world politics when he has no knowledge of the coming war.    The plot of this story is actually pretty thin.  We've all seen it before.  However, the original copywrite is 1934.  This must have been pretty heady stuff back then.<br />This is not the best Amber I've read.  &quot;A Coffin for Dimetrios&quot; is probably a better place to start with this author.	2003-02-27

I'm a fan of the Renko series.  <br />\\"December 6\\" is a historical, intrigue novel set in 1941 Tokyo days before the Pearl Harbor attack.  The main character Niles is an American expat club owner who grew up in Japan.  He is neither totally American or can ever be Japanese, but he loves Japan and the Japanese.  Think Rick in \\"Casablanca\\" and you have most of the character.  The whole story takes place in about four days (with flashbacks for background) as Niles tries to get out of Dodge, avoid his enemies, and help his friends.  No good deed goes unpunished should be the subtitle.<br />I'm a sucker for historical novels.  I found the pre-war Tokyo and China setting to be very interesting having been to Japan and read a bit on the political history of the period.  However, I believe the author verges on histrionics in his explanation of the embargo as the cassus belli.   <br />Recommended.	2003-02-17

It is the ordinary people, and not Bernard Brecht,  Albert Einstein, Joey Goebbels that put their shoulder to the wheel of  history.  Naked female stage shows aside. (Minus another star.)<br />In  addition, new information from the Osti archives and interviews could  up-date this considerably (if any of them are left alive).	2000-05-15

It also leaves threads hanging at the conclusion.   (We are never told from what virus strain (H?N?) the recovered RNA  indicated the 1918 flu belonged.  Finally, the chatty biographies of the  books personalities were really annoying to have to wade through.  (Does it  really matter that Kirsty Duncan does Celtic dancing?)<br />Pass this up and  go straight to &quot;America's Forgotten Pandemic&quot;.	2000-01-01

The final (and predictable) confrontation had to be resolved in about 100 words.  This is nobody's  magnum opus.	1999-12-12
