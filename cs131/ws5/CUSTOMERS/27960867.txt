This tome is harsh & elitist to the max, but GBL parts company with his contemporaries in this mileau by basing his notion of elitism purely on intelligence & achievement. \\"Cream always rises to the top\\" he observes, & every ethnic group will have a handful of natural born leaders who will excel in everything, & an excess of those who Stalin refered to as \\"the stuffing in the mattress\\". Still, many readers will find this a bitter pill to swallow. Even though he avoids the usual sweeping generalizations based on race, a lot of \\"stuffing\\"-types may not like what he has to say.	2004-10-28

You'll recognize the stories from sunday school perhaps, but the details are much more esoteric than what you're used to. These were passed down in an oral tradition in which  those transmitting the knowledge were sworn to an oath not to change so much as \\"a single iota\\". They didn't, & the result is as bizarre as it is symbolic & fascinating. Not a Christian or a Jew? No matter. These volumes will be of interest to all who consider themselves mystics.

All esoteric philosophy & much of mythology alludes to these \\"fallen angels\\" as having passed down their wisdom to mankind. Many myths declare them to be our progenitors.

SEPTUAGINT comes from the greek, meaning 70. Due to the complexities inherent in the hebrew language, greeks desiring a comprehensive version of biblical texts hired seventy Rabbis to translate a definative greek version. It was assumed that out of 70 differing versions, some sort of concensus version might be arrived at-- a synthesis based upon the most common interpretations of the material. To their utter shock, the greeks discovered that all 70 translations were exactly the same, word for word. AN AMAZING WORK, & not at all like what you've read in the past.	2004-10-23

As a teen I had the opportunity to see Arturo Shwarz give a lecture on Duchamp, called \\"archetypal alchemical iconography & the work of Marcel Duchamp\\". Though much of what he said was lost on me, the bits I could make out spoke directly to my soul. A favorite artist of mine thus took on a far greater significance in my estimation, & the way I looked at life was never quite the same. This has got to be the definative work on Duchamp, from a man who was both his greatest protagonist,& a close personal friend.

At age 17 I wrote to Rudi Gernreich, imploring him to let me work for him & sending him my own futuristic fashion designs. I never heard back, of course; why would an iconoclast need imput from a teenager? This man prefigured so much that happened in later decades that most of what he did still looks cutting edge today. He saw himself as being a few years ahead of his time. More like a few deades. David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust owes more than a bit to Rudi's unisex designs, up to & including the shaved eyebrows. The look was startling & alien in 1973, imagine how it looked in psychedelic era 60s! Peggy Moffit's book is a godsend, & she is a Pop Icon extraordinaire. The future hasn't been nearly as groovy as Gernreich envisioned, but this book offers a glimpse of what it might have been. He was a true visionary.	2004-09-29

Ozma of Oz would be seen as a great work of literature but for the fact that it was a best selling childrens book. It is every bit as bizzare as Raymond Roussel's \\"Impressions of Africa\\", & Baum was doing this AGES before his more seriously taken European counterparts. It's loaded with imagery both charming & creepy--- talking hens, an evil princess with a room full of living severed heads, a race of men with wheels instead of hands--- stories so strange that no one today has matched them. Baum concocted these tales purely to amuse the children who hung out around his general store. His wife suggested he write them down, and suddenly, rather late in life he became a bestselling author. Ozma of Oz is the basis of the Disney film \\"Return to Oz\\", a movie that Roger Ebert warned would give children nightmares. Indeed. The actual book is far stranger still.	2004-09-25

Many of the sisters WERE rebels. Unity rebeled against the conventions of her time. She took her pet rat to the debutantes ball, played 5 radios tuned to different stations simultaneously (turned up full blast), & generally did as she pleased. Had she not fallen in with Hitler, it's doubtful that anyone other than rabid anglophiles would know or care about her. BUT, had she not fallen in with Hitler it's also possible that she would be a feminist icon of sorts. This book captures Unity in all her paradoxical complexity. Hitler hated lipstick, yet Unity refused not to wear it in his presence. He hated women drivers, yet was delighted to see Unity zooming about Munich in her sports car. She was a unique woman who refused to bow down before anyone, up to & including her \\"idol\\", Hitler. Read this bio & you'll find a woman that, like most fascinating figures, was wildly out of step with the times in which she lived; & as a result will continue to be misunderstood by most. Nonetheless, it's a great read, however you feel about Unity and/or her politics.	2004-09-24
