Tis was doomed before it ever came out because it would suffer by comparison. However, this is still a great read by an interesting man who has great sensitivity to dialogue, and makes some stinging social observations with great subtlety. The books cannot be compared unless you have strong feelings about the skill the writer had, or did not have in either volume. Is the language rougher, yes, this is a man describing his life, not a child. Does he have opinions that are black and white, with little room for gray at times, yes. Part of the problem with moving from one book to the next, is that the memories of a child, and terrible memories at that, are a powerful force to draw you in, and cause one to feel great sympathy and pain for the child. Then the child becomes a man, and it's much more difficult to carry the same empathy from the first book to the second. In fact I don't think it is possible. If you have read neither book, read this first, and then Angela's Ashes. The books change dramatically when you do. The harsh criticism of the man becomes infinitely more complex and difficult if you learn of the childhood that was his formative years. Most autobiographies, or biographies cover a life, not pieces of a life that in this case are still unfolding. The abrupt change from book one to book two is caused, I believe, because they are bound separately. If he had covered the same period in his life with a single book it would have been more comfortable for the reader. I am glad that he did break his life up, as Angela's Ashes will forever remain a book that will gain the title of a \\"Classic\\". Book one was brilliant, it was the author's first, it won The Pulitzer, it one other awards, it is about to be shown as a major motion picture. There is no one that can follow that act #1. Frank McCourt is a great writer who I wish had come to us sooner. I hope he lives to be a hundred so I may selfishly read as much as possible of what he writes.as possible of what he writes.	2005-07-24

Part I, Progressions for Athlete Development, is a tool for the coach to use when designing the overall plan for an athlete's career development. Part II, Progressions for Coach Development, provides general concepts for how coaches can promote development of their athletes in five areas--training, biomechanics, physiology, character development and life skills, and psychology. Finally, this book incorporates the USA Swimming Training Categories Handbook in appendixes A and B.	2005-05-07

I can't believe that Focus on the Family is still promoting this book, after this couple has been repeatedly caught in their lies.<br /><br />I don't intend to shame or ridicule these authors - they've already been through hell, and John Paulk has spoken publicly about his suicidal tendencies & persistent homosexual fantasies (even since the publication of this book).<br /><br />But the truth is that Anne Paulk was never a lesbian, and John Paulk is still very gay. There were several reports of him being caught in a gay bar in Washington DC recently, and he lied about it to his boss, James Dobson, on the radio. Then some photos were produced as evidence, so he & James Dobson got on the radio again to lie about it and manufacture an excuse. Then evidence mounted that he has been frequenting gay bars & may have been soliciting gay sex, so once again he & James Dobson got on the radio to manufacture yet another version of the \\"truth\\".<br /><br />(My favorite is when John Paulk said he wasn't soliciting sex, he was only asking directions to the nearest bathroom, but it took him 40 minutes to spit out the question. Then later, he said no, he wasn't asking directions to the nearest bathroom, he was doing \\"research\\" on how much gay bars have changed since the last time he visited one!)<br /><br />Finally, James Dobson said that homosexuality is like alcoholism -- that people are never fully healed, and that they remain \\"in recovery\\" for their entire lives. All of this is well documented & can be looked up on Google.<br /><br />Well... wait a minute Mr. Dobson! The whole point of this book & your bigoted, anti-gay movement is to prove that God can heal a person instantly.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is an extremely disingenuous book, backed by an extremely deceptive movement, full of myths, propoganda, shame, and ugly bitterness. You can read a gay insider's view of the Fundamentalist movement in Strangers at the Gate by Mel White. The Paulks and people like them are very confused; they are being threatened with shame, ridicule, rejection, isolation, humiliation, violence, & threats of eternal damnation; they are being abused by Fundamentalist oppressors; and they need our help & prayers.<br /><br />Also try: Stealing Jesus, What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality, Scared Straight, or Gay & Healthy in a Sick Society. And if you're here because you're thinking about buying this book, please don't abuse yourself any further by going to a so-called \\"Christian\\" psychologist.

For all those who are disenchanted and frustrated by the jargon and mythology that now afflict management, industrial planner Merritt Kastens has written a truly \\"Utopian\\" book. It redefines the manager's role:  \\"The manager takes available resources and manipulates them in such a way as to create something of value that did not exist before.\\" It employs a new conceptual framework for the functions of management, providing innovative but rational approaches to handling today's complex responsibilities. Kastens shows how to: recognize new opportunities for organizational and personal growth, get things done while others sit on their hunches, focus resources on results, make production productive and support services supportive, cope with forces you can't control, escape double taxation. get rid of incopetents, substitute rational procedures for irrational practices, plan for the real world, overcome managerial lag, get more output from fixed assets, and much more.	2005-04-26

This is an account of the courageous mission that was quickly labeled an intelligence failure by Congress and a Pentagon blunder by the world press.  Determined to ferret out the truth, Schemmer uncovers one of the CIA's most carefully guarded secrets.  From the planning and live-fire rehearsals to the explosive reactions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff watching the drama unfold to the aftermath as the White House and Pentagon struggled for damage control, Schemmer tackles the tough questions:  What really happened during the twenty-seven minutes the raiders spent on the ground?  Did the CIA know the whole time that the Americans were gone?  Had the Agency in fact been responsiblie for the POWs being moved?  And perhaps most intriguing, why was the rescue--though it never freed a single prisoner--not a failure after all?	2005-04-25

Anika Moa sounds like a mix between Natalie Merchant, Sarah Mclaughlin, and Jars of Clay. Some of her songs definatley have a religious undertone, but not too churchy ... her sound & lyrics would be right at home within a contemporary progressive spiritual community. I do not believe the CD was not intended to be a religious album, rather, it sounds like she just sings about the things that inspire her.<br /><br />I would categorize it within the alternative genre, but with some interesting sounds & instruments that you wouldn't normally hear: pan flute, cello, mandolin, 12-string acoustic guitar, unique percussion, and other South Pacific influences. Upbeat & inspirational. Her music is still very difficult to find in the U.S., particularly because she's not touring here. Plus she's very young, and this is her debut album. Her CD sales are beginning to skyrocket in New Zealand and Europe - hopefully we can hear more from her very soon.<br /><br />Tracks on this CD include: (1) Good in My Head, (2) Flowers for You, (3) Falling in Love Again, (4) I Talked to You, (5) My Son, (6) Holding Me High, (7) Mother, (8) Youthful, (9) God in His Culture, (10) Everything's the Same.	2005-04-23

As a beginning copywriter, John Caples wrote what is probably the most famous ad of all time, \\"They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano...\\"  With 31 years' experience and the same skill and imagination, he is also the author of this practical text on the question of central interest to all copywriters--What makes one ad pay, while another fails?<br /><br />Caples analyzes the hundreds of successful ads quoted in this book, and the many side-by-side comparisons between two similar but not equally successful ads. In analyzing these examples, he isolates the essential appeal of the ad that made it a success.  These analyses yield principles, procedures, tips and practical suggestions--each tested with 31 years' experience--that you can immediately apply to any copy assignment in any media and style.<br /><br />All copywriters, from cub to chief, should find a spot within easy reach for this useful, practical text.

This volume is the complete Bratsk Station, Yevtushenko's major work, an epic cycle of thirty-five poems about the building of the hydroelectric power station at Bratsk in Siberia.  To the poet, the Bratsk project represents the best elements of traditional and modern Russian life as brought together under the Soviet System.  In Bratsk Station and the twenty-six other new poems collected here, Yevtushenko writes fervently of his faith in the ideals behind the Revolution, of the Russian land and people--and often of the troubled relation of the artist's \\"I\\" to the \\"we\\" of government.	2005-03-21

Prepared by the Transportation Research Board Committee on Lime & Lime-fly Ash Stabilization, and the National Research Council. Many significant engineering properties of soils are beneficially modified by lime treatment. Altough lime is primarily utilized to treat fine-grained soils, it can also be used to modify the characteristics of the fine fraction of more granular soils. Lime treatment can expedite construction, modify subgrade soils, and improve strength and durability of fine-grained soils. Lime-treated soils have also been used as modified subgrades, subbase materials, and base materials in pavement construction. The location of the lime-treated layer in the pavement system is dictated by strength, durability, and other design criteria. Railroad subgrades have also been successfully stabilized with lime. This book contains a comprehensive analysis of current practice and technical literature in this field.	2005-03-16

The first section of the book examines the nature and dimensions of the problem. The second section goes on to look at the malaise of the old-established cities of the developed world, and the reasons for their slide into decay and disorder. The third section turns to the exploding centers of the Third World. A fourth section examines the degree of success which the two planned societies of Russia and China have met with in their efforts to contain city growth.<br /><br />In the potential urban timebombs of Asia, Africa and South America there is also, paradoxically, the greatest hope. For the sense of community, economic resourcefulness and the talents for self help that are thriving in the poorest squatter settlements offer some prospect that out of this unpromising soil a new model, a revitalized ideal of urban life might emerge.<br /><br />It is extremely interesting to look at how close the authors came to the reality of the 21st Century.	2005-03-04

In the introductory lesson, students investigate some properties of light and their application in optical devices. Throughout the module they engage in a series of carefully sequenced activities to deal with common misconceptions and develop new understandings. The module consists of the following three sections:<br /><br /> Nature of Light<br /><br />In these 13 lessons students examine the sources of light, its travel in straight lines, shadows, and the application of the principles of its travel in a pinhole camera. In the lessons on color they investigate the electromagnetic spectrum and its visible portion, colored light, and colored objects. Students also begin developing and evaluating two models-particle and wave-to explain the behaviors of light they investigate.<br /><br /> Reflection and Refraction<br /><br />Students investigate the reflection of light from plane and curved mirrors and the refraction through various media. They use their experimental data to develop an understanding of angles of reflection and refraction. Convex and concave lenses are used to produce images for investigation. Again, the wave and particle models are compared based on students' experiments with refraction and reflection.<br /><br /> Using Light<br /><br />After investigating the images produced by lenses, students use combinations of lenses to construct simple optical devices, such as a telescope and periscope. They deconstruct a camera to examine its components and their function. The last lessons of the module focus on visual perception of humans and animals, the structure of the human eye, and communication using light.	2005-02-21

And whose love for a handsome Greek physician, her fianc&eacute;'s slave, is revealed here for the first time.<br /><br />Turia's story pulsates with the grandeur, terror and excitement of Julius Ceasar's Rome. When her parents are brutally murdered on their farm, Turia's fianc&eacute;, Quintus, leaves her in the care of his slave, Alexis. A slave for political reasons only, Alexis is overwhelmed by his growing passion for this loveley--and spirited--young woman. And Turia is increasingly drawn to Alexis...<br /><br />Consumed by this love, and the honor that forbids it, they also pledge vengeance on the aristocratic Romans who plotted the murder of Turia's mother and father. Their loyalty to this cause threatens their very lives...in a story which has endured for twenty centuries, and is destined to last as long as love itself.	2005-02-15

An excellent book, not just about politics, but about worldviews, ideologies, and framing those larger questions.<br /><br />Lakoff helps explain what's going on in our culture. Conservatives are winning despite ruining the environment, overspending by trillions of dollars, doing the opposite of what they say, killing millions of innocent victims...and they do this by convincing people to vote against their own interests. How? Because their \\"think tanks\\" have been working towards these ends for over 30 years, and they know how to frame issues in ways people can relate to.<br /><br />It's not that people are dumb. \\"Conservatives\\" (who aren't really conservative at all) win and progressives lose for two reasons. First, progressives are horrible communicators. They're bad at painting the big picture (framing). Second, it's a codependent dance between these two groups in our culture. Conservatives cut the social programs, and progressives run around picking up the pieces. The more they cut, the more we burn ourselves out and keep getting distracted from much needed<br /><br />systemic/institutional change.<br /><br />All progressives will benefit from this book. Democratic Officials ~really~ need to read this book and listen to Lakoff. The DNC strikes me as a group with no core, no values except for holding a finger to the wind.<br /><br />And they are not learning the lessons they need to learn from these elections. They refuse to speak out against election fraud. They refuse to stand up for disenfranchised minority voters. They fail to stand up against an illigitimate presidency. And they keep moving to the \\"center\\" instead of standing up for their beliefs and values. What's needed is a complete Lakoff overhaul.	2004-11-17

Well, I read through it - couldn't finish it. Quite frankly I didn't understand what all the buzz was about. Nothing revolutionary. In fact, disappointing.<br /><br /> I really enjoyed some of his earlier publications, and continue to be inspired by the Holonomy book he edited: The Holographic Paradigm and Other Paradoxes. I definately recommend it, or better yet, Reenchantment of the World by Morris Berman.<br /><br /> But One Taste is supposed to give us a small taste of his inner thoughts via his private daily journal. Al Gore and Bill Clinton were both seen carrying it around, I guess to give us the impression that they are philosphically and spiritually contemplative. Reviewers called it: profound, dizzying, epiphanic, multi-dimensional, &quot;expansive talk of higher states of being&quot;...and I don't get it.<br /><br /> Most of the questions he was asking were things we studied in Philophy 101 and 201, and dare I say, it bored me then as much as it bores me now. Things like, whether or not there is one primal force behind all religions (an Eliadean quest); how religion can be proved &quot;objectively&quot;; uniting psychology and other disciplines with spirituality (without substantial elaboration); if the New Age movement and postmodernism are just fads (a term which he didn't bother to define); how dualism is bad (again, without substantial elaboration); whether truth is subjective or objective, etc.<br /><br /> Not to mention, downright boring in parts - I don't really care what TV shows he watches, his shopping habits, etc. And at parts, self-absorbed. Lots of name dropping. Lots. And lots. Name dropping on almost every page. It's hard to criticize a person's private thoughts, but it kinda sounds like a yuppie boomer with some middle-age crisis questions. It's amazing what some people consider profound.<br /><br /> Want radical? Progressive? Compelling? Why not question the notion of middle class, the addiction called money, the concept of &quot;career&quot;, the US economic system as myth...and check out The Way We Never Were, by Stephanie Coontz. I just started it, and love it's challenges to our concept of reality, the myths that we are conditioned to accept as &quot;objective history&quot;, and the way most of us organize our lives.<br /><br /> Here Wilber mostly stays in the philosophical /theoretical realm, which is ironic, given that his contributions in Holonomy discuss the disembodied self, and that he considers himself an activist of sorts. But I don't see Wilber doing anything practical with this thought - it comes off as reflections mixed in with some marketing appeal to the so-called intellectual and class elites.<br /><br /> Stick to his prior books.the addiction called money, the concept of &quot;career&quot;, the US economic system as myth...and check out The Way We Never Were, by Stephanie Coontz.

US	43335941	RW4FI2I4XAATN	1400031699	39256491	The Little Friend	Books	1	18	30	N	N	Not misunderstood...just bad	There are obviously differing opinions on the quality of this writing. I believe this book is widely misunderstood because of the synopsis on the back of the book, and the way this book has been marketed and reviewed. It was billed as a mystery novel, which it is not.<br /><br />It is not that I'm an unintelligent person who fills my mind with the fluff of King and Grisham, rather, when I read a murder mystery, I like to have the murder solved (or at least have an ending).<br /><br />I enjoyed the growth of the character Hariett, but for the most part Tartt's bloated descriptions of irrelevant details was a misuse both of paper and of my time. The only reason I stuck with the book was to find out how the murder was solved...which it was not! I found that the drift away from the supposed murder plot caused the book to become uninteresting and not worth my time.<br /><br />And even more, I resent that I have to take the time to warn people about such a horrible book (I've never written such a negative review before!). But I feel it's my civic duty to save you good readers from the tangled literary web of Donna Tartt.  There are much better books out there, do not waste your time on these 500+ pages of meandering descriptions and run-on sentences.	2004-07-25

If you've heard Clark Howard's show more than 5 or 6 times, the information in this book is going to be very redundant for you.<br />I love Clark Howard - I honestly listen every chance I get. His syndicated talk show is one of the most empowering consumer programs on the radio today, second only to Bruce Williams.  But I would recommend passing on this book, and perhaps read another of his books instead.<br />The topics and advice in this book are not very creative. The book is organized by subject heading: best deals on medicine, clothes, cars and car parts, furniture, etc.  Roughly half of the book is simply a pitch for Costco (if Clark isn't getting royalties from Costco, he should be!). This is not an exaggeration - he goes on and on and on about how he found great prices for shoes, clothes, books, music, hardwood floors, food, etc., at Costcos.<br />There are several problems with this recommendation. First, I think these wholesale clubs are way too expensive! If you're looking for creative ways to save money, there are MUCH cheaper ways about it (i.e., the internet, garage sales, flea markets, salvage yards, etc.).  In the past, he's talked about saving a dime per stick of deoderant at Costcos, when one can buy a box of 100 sticks of deoderant on eBay for about $10 (I know - I did it last week!).  Second, places like Costco & Walmart's Sams Club are destructive to the environment and exploit third-world and domestic labor...and many people (myself included) cannot support organizations like these with a clear conscience. Third, this recommendation doesn't really get radical about saving or conserving.<br />Instead of shopping at cheaper stores, how about shopping less?  Our little country consumes nearly 2/3 the world's resources - we don't need more stuff!  Instead of buying a new \\"energy-efficient\\" fridge, how about fixing the old one? Or finding a radical alternative (like my inexpensive solar fridge) that requires no electicity at all? These big corporations exploit workers and consumers, then convince us there aren't any real alternatives to mainstream consumption habits. Unfortunately, Clark's book doesn't question this model at all. If you want one that does, try: \\"Your Money Or Your Life\\", \\"Voluntary Simplicity\\", & \\"The Solar Living Sourcebook\\", just to name a few.<br />There are a few useful tid-bits in the book - like his recommendation for buying tires online at tirerack.com - but it sucks up about 4 pages (nearly an entire chapter) to make this one recommendation! And to make it worse, each chapter has a lengthy summary at the end, which simply restates (in bullet format) exactly what was said in the previous pages.  This is extremely repetitive - I got through the entire book in less than 30 minutes, and didn't learn much at all.<br />Sorry Clark! Keep up the good work on the radio.ions exploit workers and consumers, then convince us there aren't any real alternatives to mainstream consumption habits.

US	43335941	R1HWQP5OQNNKF7	1590072510	194848581	Stupid White Men: And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation	Books	5	16	26	N	Y	Excellent....	A must-read for anyone interested in politics, humor, or the future of the United States.<br />I've suggested this book for American History, Cultural History, and Political Science classes in high school and college. This would be a fantastic supplement to a high school civics class (in particular, the chapter on student activism and subversiveness).<br />Read by Arte Johnson, who has a very good voice for this presentation, though he needs to learn what a \\"dot-com\\" is. :)<br />I strongly suggest the audio version over the book version. While Moore is a fantastic with wit and commentary, his writing style is rigid and sometimes difficult to read. It's very entertaining to hear Arte Johnson present it.<br />Everyone should read Moore's open letter to President Bush, in which Moore presents strong evidence that Bush is a felon, an alcoholic, a drug addict, and is neglectful of his own family and children.<br />I've kept my name anonymous - last time I wrote a review like this, you conservatives and fundamentalists out there send me e-mail threats, signed me up for mountains of spam, and even phoned a few death threats to my home. Please refrain this time - and instead concentrate on how you can help keep this a free country.	2003-01-01

From the criticism of our universities as purveyors of hopelessness to the dynamics of &quot;getting laid,&quot; Scared Straight is an eye-opening and penetrating analysis of U.S. culture, explaining why accepting the full humanity of gay people divides people and organizations.<br />Dr. Minor shows how homophobia is a major ingredient in our way of defining the world. Without sparing any of our cultural institutions, Scared Straight identifies our culture as fear-based and in denial. Like software installed in a computer, our system's messages install a &quot;straight role&quot; in us which actually has little, if anything, to do with sexual orientation. In the end it has little to do with religion, tradition, or the Bible, and everything to do with maintaining quite limiting definitions of a &quot;human being,&quot; a &quot;real man&quot; and a &quot;real woman.&quot;<br />People of all sexual orientations are hurt by the &quot;straight&quot; role, torn from their full human potential, and squeezed into the molds which support our dominant institutions. Human relationships with either sex are incomplete and unfulfilling. Chapters on &quot;How to Be Straight&quot; and &quot;How to Be Gay&quot; describe the roles straight and gay people are conditioned to live in order to maintain this status quo. Yet, not content to merely identify the problem and its depth, in the final chapter Dr. Minor describes the dual elements of healing that this cultural disease requires.<br />An insightful analysis for anyone interested in gender studies, religious studies, queer theory, feminism, and cultural critique.  Though it was only released a few weeks ago by HumanityWorks! and PersonalEnrichment.Org, this book is receiving much attention at many religious conferences and gay pride festivals all over the country!  Find out what all the buzz is about!	2001-07-24
