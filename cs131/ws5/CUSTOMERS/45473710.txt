Nor is it a battle history of Wellington's campaigns, although these are sketched at varying levels of detail in the course of the narrative.  Nor is it an operational or strategic level history of the Napoleonic Wars in the manner of Oman or Chandler.<br /><br />Corrigan's approach is to depict Wellington as a military officer in the context of the British Army and of the wars of his time.  It seems clear from the narrative and the footnotes that the author is very familiar with the British Army of Wellington's time and of our own.  The focus is on Wellington's development as a officer through his experiences in Ireland, Flanders, India, the Peninsula, and the final Campaign of the Hundred Days.  Corrigan provides much contextual discussion on the ways in which the British military establishment did its business in that day and age.  Corrigan's prose is solid, straightforward, and unvarnished.  His narrative is interesting and seems to cover all the major points in an already well-plowed field.<br /><br />It seems clear that Corrigan admires Wellington as a military leader, and the narrative makes the case that Wellington was an exceptionally professional and succcessful military officer, even by the battle-hardened standards of his time.  The intent to package Wellington's long military career into a single volume of moderate length means many details must be glossed over and some controversies bypassed, but the author does provide some interesting items for consideration.  For example, he asserts that there is no definitive proof that Wellington was ever unfaithful to his wife.  This statement is possibly correct in the narrowest sense, although it flies in the face of both a wealth of anecdotes and the judgment of other historians.  For another example, Corrigan dismisses much of the academic controversy over the respective generalships of Wellington and Napoleon at Waterloo, by noting that each was ultimately responsible for the conduct of the army each led.  Wellington fought a hands-on battle on ground of his own choosing in coordination with his Prussian counterpart; Napoleon gambled much and delegated much, and paid the price.<br /><br />Corrigan offers short but effective bio's of some of the officers with whom Wellington served.  His discussion of Sir John Moore, for example, is more nuanced than the usual hagiographic comments; Corrigan brings out Moore's challenges with higher authority, although he does not give full credit for the beneficial strategic results of Moore's aborted campaign in Spain in late 1808, which probably distracted Napoleon from completing the military conquest of Spain.<br /><br />Corrigan's biography of Wellington is a very serviceable one volume history for the general reader and for the military professional looking for a straightforward narrative.anecdotes and the judgment of other historians.

In it, the Duke of Wellington, at the head of an Anglo-Portuguese-Spanish Army, crosses the French border as part of a larger Allied coalition campaign to end Napoleon's reign as Empereor of France.  Wellington's campaign is paced by the on-again, off-again negotiations between Napoleon and the Coalition.  A series of victories by Wellington's Army over the forces of French Marshal Soult are therefore never quite decisive.  Wellington's Army, in addition, faced formidable challenges conducting an offensive inside France over difficult terrain and against a nominally hostile population.  However, Wellington's task is made easier by Marshal Soult's seeming inability to manage his army in close combat, and by the slow wasting of what had once been a veteran French Army, as enthusiasm for Napoleon begins to dwindle.<br /><br />Oman's mastery of his subject and of his prose is complete.  The narrative flows smoothly.  His retelling of the second siege of San Sebastian is remarkably vivid, capturing both the heroism and the horror of the final Allied storming of that fortress.  His account of the confusing multi-day Battle of the Nive is clear and easy to follow.  Oman highlights the remarkable tenacity of British and Portuguese infantry battalions that withstood a series of French counterattacks at unequal odds.  Oman's narrative of the campaign across southern France is clearer than any other studies this reader is familiar with.<br /><br />The primary focus of this book is the confrontation between Wellington's Army and the French Army under Marshal Soult.  However, Oman does not neglect the campaign in Catalonia or the political background to the last nine months of the Peninsular War.  Oman includes a nice concluding essay about the fates of the more prominent generals after the war, as well as an acknowledgement of the messy end of the conflict in Spain.<br /><br />In this volume, the last of seven, Oman assumes that readers are already familiar with the history of the Peninsular War up through the fall of 1813 and the Battle of the Pyrenees.  Oman does not recap the story, nor does he reintroduce personalities from earlier volumes.  There is just a slight sense that Oman was pushing to finish a project that had already taken nearly thirty years.<br /><br />This volume and series are highly recommended to dedicated readers of the Peninsular War and the Napoleonic era.

This novel continues the adventures of the United Nations Anti-Crime Organization (UNACO) operatives first introduced in \\"Death Train\\" (and dramatized in the movie of the same name by Pierce Brosnan, Alexandra Paul, and Patrick Stewart).<br /><br />The story features exotic locales, suitable adversaries in the IRA, the Mafia, and Columbian drug lords, and a complicated plot that literally twists and turns to the very last page.  For those attached to the UNACO operatives of the earlier novels in this series, the story is reasonably suspenseful and mildly entertaining.<br /><br />McNeill has mastered MacLean's basic plotting mechanics but falls well short of MacLean's ironic and understated writing style, and his dialogue is often awkward.  Serious fans of Alistair MacLean's work will find this a pale copy and are advised to stick to MacLean's original works.	2005-09-28

As Holmes points out, this is the period of time in which the British Army, although never the size of its European counterparts, managed to play a key role in the conflicts of Europe, especially the Napoleonic Wars, and in the establishment of a worldwide Empire.  How the British Army was equal to this challenge is the subtle theme of this book.<br /><br />\\"Redcoat\\" is not a battle history, although Holmes makes frequent references to the Army in battle and on campaign.  Instead, Holmes focuses on the organization, equipment, and life of the Army during this period.  We find that the British Army ranked behind the Royal Navy in terms of funding and prestige, and was saddled with a complicated, even Byzantine organizational and support structure designed, perhaps, to keep it from being too efficient and therefore a threat to the state it served.<br /><br />Holmes suggests that the British Army fashioned its success out of a unique set of circumstances that involved the integration of a more or less volunteer soldier into regiments with generally well-established traditions, armed with basically reliable weapons, and led by officers and NCO's who, if often more enthusiastic than professional, was also often surprisingly good.  Out of these combinations came an infantry that was as  professional, and as successful in battle, as that of any nation in the period; the British cavalry and artillery also often performed well.<br /><br />That the British Army suffered from all the shortcomings of any armed force in that age (or any age) is also thoroughly explored by Holmes.  Particular attention is paid to a draconian system of discipline and to what now seems like incredibly harsh and unhealthy living conditions.<br /><br />\\"Redcoat\\" covers over a century of conflict and numerous changes in organization, equipment, and national policy.  This is perhaps too much material to handle in a single volume; the narrative ocassionally wanders and sometimes jumps from topic to topic.  Richard Holmes is an exceptional capable writer who is obviously very familiar with his subject.  Readers who can persist through the long text will be rewarded by his combination of factual narrative and vivid vignettes that provide a human scale to the story.

The Copelands are experienced and obviously very fit hikers who offer their take on worthwhile hikes.<br /><br />The book is divided into a series of chapters, each covering a hike or area of interlinked hikes.  Each chapter offers basic data such as the distance of hikes, elevation change, and a rating for difficulty.  The Copeland's rating system of easy, moderate and challenging presupposes at least some level of basic fitness and should be taken seriously with respect to the challenge posed by the terrain and the highly variable weather in the Canadian Rockies.  Each chapter includes commentary on the special aspects of the terrain covered by the hike, typically grouped with sketch maps and photos and a recommendation for the appropriate supplemental map.<br /><br />The Copelands also offer much useful information on the weather, wildlife, and other potential hazards in the Rockies, along with sound recommendations for equipment and trip planning.<br /><br />The Copelands write in an entertaining style; this author found their opinions on what can be experienced on various hikes to be well-founded, based on several seasons of hiking in the Canadian Rockies.

Kananaskis Country gets much less publicity, at least outside Calgary, than the justly famous and much older Banff National Park.  For those who have already \\"done\\" Banff and Lake Louise, this guide opens up a new, and in its own way, hugely worthwhile area for exploration by hikers.<br /><br />The guide offers descriptions of 41 separate hikes (some of which are interlinked) in Kannaskis Country.  The Copelands have rated the hikes by degreee of difficulty from easy to challenging.  The assignment of rating seems based in part on how difficult the terrain is to traverse, as well as the distance involved and the relative altitude gain.  The Copelands are admittedly experienced and very fit hikers.  This middle-aged author and his wife, moderately fit and used to the 3,000 to 4,000 foot peaks of the Chugach Range in Alaska, tried three \\"easy\\" hikes and found them all very doable as half day hikes under at least average weather conditions and without technical assistance.<br /><br />The guide includes information on what is unique or special about the terrain associated with each hike, whether an especially good view of the Continental Divide or the chance to cross a beautiful Alpine meadow.  The level of detail includes, in some cases, what time of day may provide the best viewing (many valleys and high cirques in Kannaskis Country may be in shadow in the morning or the afternoon, depending on their orientation). The selection of photos provide some sense of scale for the terrain. The sketch maps included in each chapter don't provide much detail for routefinding, especially in areas without well-established trails; we heartily endorse the use of the Gem Trek maps recommended by the authors as a necessary supplement.<br /><br />The guide includes much useful commentary on wildlife, weather, and other potential hazards in the Canadian Rockies, as well as some sound recommendations on equipment.  The latter will be especially useful for hikers who may not have seen many days with 30 degree temperature ranges and weather that runs the full gamut of sun, shower, and snow in a single half-day hike.<br /><br />This guide is highly recommended for hikers visiting the Canadian Rockies west of Calgary and looking for \\"where the locals go.\\"ards in the Canadian Rockies, as well as some sound recommendations on equipment.

Roberts writes in clear, easy to understand prose, surveying the battle from the strategic to the tactical levels.  He includes a number of well-chosen vignettes at the individual level to provide a sense of scale of the battle, as well as necessary explanation on the equipment and organizations of the participating armies.<br /><br />Roberts quickly touches a number of the academic controversies about the battle.  Among others, these include the status of Napoleon's health during the Waterloo Campaign, the extent of Wellington's surprise at the French crossing of the border, the placement of allied troops at Hal to block a possible French flanking manuever on the Mont St. Jean position, and the cooperation between Wellington and Blucher.  In each case, he deftly mentions the nature of the controversy, offers a brief opinion, and moves on.  Serious students of Waterloo may find this approach overly simplified, but it should suffice for the average reader. Roberts does go to some effort to mention the the contributions of all members of the allied coalition that fought at Waterloo, including Belgian and Dutch units that are often neglected.<br /><br />The treatment of the course of the battle of Waterloo follows a commonly used breakdown of the combat into five phases.  Roberts' real gift is his ability to present the story of Waterloo in a manner that covers the significant details but can be followed by the average reader.  Of necessity, Roberts has simplified a great deal of information to achieve the short format; this work is focused on the battle rather than the larger campaign of the hundred days. He includes a nice bibliography for those readers seeking more detail.  There is also a nice selection of maps and photos to orient the reader.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for the casual reader seeking a managable and enjoyable summary of the Battle of Waterloo.commended for the casual reader seeking a managable and enjoyable summary of the Battle of Waterloo.	2005-09-08

Philip Henry, then Lord Mahan, later Earl Stanhope, took notes of his frequent conversations with the Duke during the period 1831-1851, ending just months before the Duke's death.<br /><br />\\"Conversations\\" offers some insight into the lives of the British upper class of that period, a seemingly endless series of visits, horseback rides, and dinners, sandwiched between business in Parliament and visits to country estates.<br /><br />\\"Conversations\\" also reminds us of the elaborate code of manners and behavior expected in that era.  As an example, Stanhope has the sense of discretion not to record the names of people who come up in his conversations with the Duke, who might be embarrassed at a later date.  This rule seems to have applied principally to politicians contemporary with the various conversations.<br /><br />Most importantly, \\"Conversations\\" offers us insight into the character and thinking of the Duke of Wellington in his later years.  This is the Duke 15 years or more removed from Waterloo, serving the British Government in a variety of positions, still prominent enough as a hero and politician to be sought out for advice by a succession of monarchs and prime ministers.  The book is apparently the source of many quotes of the Duke that appear in more recent histories.  The Duke's inherent common sense, honesty, and sense of duty are obvious in conversation, as is the remarkable fact that a lifetime of military and politican service had given him a keen understanding of human nature but not left him cynical about it.  There is a certain sadness in the narrative as the Duke's health slowly declines, and a sense that the long-lived Duke outlived his own times.<br /><br />This edition is not annotated or provided with additional commentary beyond Elizabeth Longford's superb introduction.  The reader who is not already familar with Wellington's military and political career, and the early historiography of the Napoleonic era, may find \\"Conversations\\" very difficult to follow.  This edition is highly recommended to those interested in the Duke and his era, especially his recollections of the Peninsular War and the Waterloo Campaign.ellington's military and political career, and the early historiography of the Napoleonic era, may find \\"Conversations\\" very difficult to follow.

As Cahill lays it out, classical Greek civilization had an enormous influence on how the West approaches art, philosophy, drama, and government.  The Greek willingness to think, discuss, experiment, and investigate was the basis for remarkable innovation in heroic sculpture, democratic self-government, a framework for natural and individual philosophy, and the dramatic and comedic schools of theater.  Along the way, Cahill provides some insightful vignettes into the Greek psyche.<br /><br />Inevitably, a single volume treatment on such a complex subject as classical Greek civilization must simplify a great deal.  Also perhaps inevitably, this volume lacks some of the almost intimate emotional empathy that drove \\"How the Irish Saved Civilization\\" and to a lesser extent, the \\"Desire of the Everlasting Hills.\\"  Finally, Cahill could not resist making a few sour remarks attempting to link the Global War on Terrorism to the Peloponnesian War that caused the downfall of the great city-state of Athens.<br /><br />This volume is recommended to the reader already hooked on Cahill's hinges of history series, and those looking for a very readable survey on Greek civilization.	2005-07-10

The Scottish Regiments have a long and colorful history of valorous service on the many battlefields of British history down to the present day conflict in Iraq.  This edition is a 1996 revision of a book first published in 1988.  Its content is particularly poignant in light of the 2004 decision by the UK Ministry of Defense to amalgamate the remaining Scottish battalions into a single regiment.  That decision, made on practical grounds of facilitating unit rotations overseas, had the unfortunate effect of obscuring the distinctive identities of some very old regiments and was highly unpopular among regimental veterans.  However, as Mileham's history  notes, amalgamation and disbandment have been recurring phenomena for regiments down through the years.<br /><br />The book opens with a short introduction on the raising of regimental-size units in the British Army.  Mileham then provides a concise narrative of the history of each regiment, to include the various evolutions of naming and numbering.  Space limitations restrict the narratives to brief descriptions of postings, major battles, and campaign participation.  The record of regimental postings sketches the once vast limits of the British Empire, while the battles and campaigns tour the venues of the Napoleonic and World Wars.  For example, the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment, better known as \\"The Black Watch,\\" has since its formation in 1725 served in Scotland, Ireland, Nroth America, the Caribbean, Spain, France, the Crimea, South Africa, India, North Africa, the Middle East, Italy, and Germany.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended to the reader interested in the military heritage of Scotland and in British military history.  While particularly distinctive accomplishments in battle are noted for many regiments, those interested in detailed battle narrative should seek in individual regimental histories.  The casual reader without background in British military history may find this book challenging to follow.

Chandler conducts an extended scholarly examination of Napoleon's military campaigns, including only enough detail of his personal life and political career to provide necessay context.  Chandler writes at the operational level of war; cut and thrust accounts of individual battles should be sought elsewhere.<br /><br />The Napoleon that emerges from this study is a brillant, gifted, and charismatic soldier who is also ruthlessly ambitious, and who is slowly but surely corrupted by power.  Chandler's detailed exposition on Napoleon's methods of war make clear why he was so successful for so long.  Naploeon's ability to visualize the whole battlefield and its moving parts, and to accurately project where those parts might be days to weeks in the future enabled him to repeatedly outmaneuver and outfight his less skilled opponents.  Napoleon was also relentlessly opportunistic; the chaos of the French Revolution gave this Corsican of relatively obscure origins many opportunities he might not have been afforded in a more stable late 18th century Europe.  Finally, Napoleon inherited a national army imbued with enthusiasm, first for the ideals of revolution and later for the glory embodied by Napoleon's successes.<br /><br />Chandler writes with commendable objectivity, patiently documenting both Napoleon's gifts and his remarkably military accomplishments while refusing to fall under the spell of his visions of glory.  Chandler's portrait is balanced; Napoleon is shown as the sometimes extraordinary, sometimes flawed human he undoubtedly was.<br /><br />Chandler's treatment of the Battle of Waterloo as one aspect of the Campaign of the Hundred Days deserves special attention by readers.  More recent scholarship may have added additional detail, but Chandler captures the larger picture exceptionally well.<br /><br />This work is highly recommended to the serious student of the military art and of the Napoleonic Wars.  Chandler's careful scholarship is essential to understanding the larger era in the military sense.  The casual reader may find this book to be both densely written and overly long for easy enjoyment.lly well.<br /><br />This work is highly recommended to the serious student of the military art and of the Napoleonic Wars.

In early 1812, Napoleon withdrew some of his Imperial troops from occupied Spain for his ill-fated invasion of Russia.  The dispersal of the remaining French troops to hold down Spanish insurgents coincided with a buildup of the Anglo-Portuguese Army, enabling Wellington to go over to the offensive with an experienced and well-trained force.  The bold seizure of the Spanish frontier fortresses of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz opened the way for Wellington's magnificent victory of maneuver over Marshal Marmont's French Army at Salamanca.  Although Wellington overreached himself at the siege of Burgos and was forced to retrench on the Portuguese frontier over the winter of 1812-1813, the French had lost the initiative in the Peninsular War for good.<br /><br />Oman brings out how Napoleon's attempts to run the Peninsular War from Paris and Wellington's superior ability to gather intelligence contributed to French defeats.  Oman includes a brief but fascinating account, perhaps particularly relevant for modern readers, of the challenges faced by the British Tory government in supporting a long and expensive campaign to dislodge the French from Spain and Portugal.  The Whig Party, in opposition, decried every expense and every casualty in favor of an immediate peace treaty with Napoleon.  Such a treaty prior to Napoleon's defeat in Russia would have ceded control of Continental Europe to the French Emperor.  The Tory government withstood Whig opposition and internal dissension to perservere against Napoleon, trusting Wellington to fulfill the mission of his command.<br /><br />Oman's command of his subject in volume V is masterful. His narrative is mature and confident.  While the focus is on the operational level of war, Oman provides descriptive and ocassionally thrilling vignettes of the critical battles.  The footnotes provide much additional context.<br /><br />This volume and series are highly recommended to serious students of the Napoleonic Wars.

US	45473710	R2O49CQCOLTF0I	000611962X	821995681	The Guns of Navarone	Books	5	29	31	N	N	The legendary "Guns of Navarone"	For those who know \\"The Guns of Navarone\\" only from the justly famous movie starring Gregory Peck and David Niven, Alistair MacLean's novel will be an enjoyable surprise.  \\"Navarone\\" is, with \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", the Scottish-born MacLean's best known work in the United States.  His story of a daring British commando raid against the fictional German-held island of Navarone is loosely based on a failed British expedition to the eastern Aegean Sea during the Second World War.  The commandos must silence the guns of the title to permit the evacuation by sea of British troops trapped on a nearby island.  The novel traces the commandos' dangerous journey by sea to Navarone and their struggles to survive and outwit the Nazi occupation force long enough to carry out their mission.<br /><br />A strength of this novel is MacLean's portrayal of well-developed and nuanced characters.  Captain Mallory, a New Zealander and pre-war mountain climber, is the leader; his deputy is Andrea, a taciturn and dangerous, yet compassionate Greek.  Others are Miller, the cynical and world-weary American explosives expert, and young Stevenson, the insecure subaltern and backup climber.  We are given enough of the background and voice of each of the major characters to understand why they are the way they are.  MacLean took care to populate the story with an interesting supporting cast of British and German military personnel and Greek villagers.  In the process, he conveys a sense of the desperately bitter partisan warfare that must have taken place in Nazi-occupied Greece.<br /><br />A second strength is MacLean's ability to weave a complicated yet compelling story.  The opening chapter sets the tone with almost brilliantly concise description and dialogue.  Mallory, obstensibly spirited out from a behind the lines mission in Crete for a rest, discovers that his boss has a more important mission for him.  Mallory's hastily put-together team must surmount a series of hair-raising challenges and make some tough choices along the way.  In precise, often understated prose, we experience with the commandos the physical and mental fatigue of a dangerous and morally ambiguous mission.  MacLean vividly portrays a harsh world of war and betrayal, in which even the best choices have brutal consequences.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended to the reader looking for an enthralling adventure story, one told with style and substance.  This is no mindless summer beach read.  \\"The Guns of Navarone\\" is MacLean at his best, a pure pleasure to read.ugh choices along the way.

MacLean is best known in the United States for &quot;Where Eagle Dare&quot; and &quot;The Guns of Navarone.&quot;  The storyline of &quot;Night Watch&quot; is vintage MacLean, with a complicated plot and lots of dangerous action on an international scale.  This novel continues with the cast of U.N. secret agents introduced in &quot;Death Train.&quot;<br /><br />The genesis of the plot is the clever theft of the Rembrandt painting &quot;NIght Watch.&quot;  The U.N. agents assigned to secure its recovery soon find themselves involved in a series of overlapping international intrigues, their mission threatened by personal conflicts and unforeseen challenges.  For those of us who miss Alistair MacLean, &quot;Night Watch&quot; is like diet soda, a reasonably refreshing and serviceable copy of MacLean's writing style from his later years.  MacNeill keeps the action moving along smartly and throws in more than enough exotic detail and locales to keep up reader interest.  The twists and turns last to the very last page.  That said, MacNeill is not quite a master of MacLean's understated ironic humor and precise use of language.  The dialogue in particular is occasionally awkward.<br /><br />This book is recommended to the reader looking for a good adventure story.  The plot is fast moving and complicated enough to be easily a step above the average beach novel.	2005-05-29

Atkinson was extremely fortunate from a writer's point of view to have the opportunity to shadow Major General David Petraeus, the Commander of the 101st Airborne Division, and even more fortunate to be privy to Petraeus's candid thinking aloud about the task at hand.  The title of the book is somewhat misleading, since it is primarily about the interactions of MG Petraeus with his subordinate assistant division commanders and brigade comanders, and with his boss, V Corps Commander LTG Wallace.<br /><br />The good news is that Atkinson, the gifted writer of the justly acclaimed \\"An Army At Dawn,\\" has the good journalist's knack for capturing vignettes with a few well-chosen words.  Atkinson has an extensive background reporting and writing on the U.S. military and is generally sympathetic towards its soldiers.  Petraeus emerges from the narrative as a tough yet thoughtful and compassionate leader, daily and even hourly balancing the demands of mission accomplishment with the welfare of his soldiers.<br /><br />Atkinson was also limited by his position as an embedded reporter.  The book's perspective is shallow and by no means a comprehensive history of Operation Iraqi Freedom or the 101st's part in it.  Atkinson is not a trained military professional; there are no grand insights into tactics or operational art.  The narrative is marred by occasional sour pronouncements on strategic or political events that seem to reflect partisan bias rather than Atkinson's experience as an embedded reporter.<br /><br />The volume is recommended to the reader looking for a sense of the experience of an embedded reporter on the ground in the opening phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Those looking for a history of the conflict should look elsewhere.	2005-05-09
US	45473710	R3KDTFKUMUL646	1853676349	388581875	5: A History of the Peninsular War, Volume V: October 1811 to August 31, 1812: Valencia, Cuidad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Madrid	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	The Turning Point of the Peninsular War	This wonderfully affordable paperback edition makes available Volume V of Charles Oman's definitive history of the Peninsular War, which covers the turning point of the war.  In early 1812, Napoleon withdrew some of his Imperial troops from Spain for the ill-fated invasion of Russia.  The dispersal of the remaining French forces to hold down Spanish insurgents coincided with a buildup of the Anglo-Portuguese Army, enabling Wellington to go over to the offensive with his experienced and well-trained force. <br /> <br />The bold seizure of the Spanish frontier fortresses of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz opended the way for Wellington's magnificent victory of maneuver over Marshal Marmont's French Army at Salamanca.  Wellington would later overreach himself at the siege of Burgos and be forced to retrench on the Portuguese frontier over the winter of 1812-1813.  However, the French had lost the initiative in the Peninsular War for good. <br /> <br />Oman includes a brief but fascinating account, perhaps particularly relevant for modern readers, of the challenges faced by the British Tory government in waging an expensive six year campaign to dislodge the French from the Iberian Peninsula.  The British Whig Party, in opposition, decried every expense and casualty in favor of an immediate peace treaty with Napoleon.  The effect of such a treaty prior to Napoleon's defeat in Russia would have been to concede control of Continental Europe to the French Emperor.  The British Ministry withstood both Whig opposition and internal Tory dissension to persevere against Napoleon and to trust Wellington to fulfill the mission of his command in Spain.   <br /> <br />Oman's command of his subject is masterful; his narrative is mature and confident.  While the focus is on the operational level of war, Oman provides descriptive and occasionally thrilling vignettes of the critical battles.  The footnotes provide much additional context which will be of interest to the serious student of the Napoleonic Wars.  The casual reader without background of the conflict may find this volume a challenging read.	2005-05-03

Despite its brevity, \\"The Art of Warfare\\" is remarkably comprehensive, addressing weapons, tactics, strategy, and supporting military services such as engineering and medical care.  Rothenberg provides a short synopsis of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and commentary on the military establishments of the principal combatants.<br /><br />Rothenberg rightly devotes much of the book to the innovations of the French Army as it evolved under the necessity first of defending the Revolution and then under the hand of its martial Emperor, Napoleon I.  The concept of the nation in arms made possible mass armies which often overwhelmed the small professional armies of its adversaries.  Lack of training led to an emphasis on shock in battle, produced by fast moving infantry columns, massed artillery fire, and operational maneuver against the flanks and rear of opponents.  Rothenberg notes the effects of a persistent French failure to build a robust supply system.  French soldiers in the field were expected to forage to survive.  The Army as a whole was forced to disperse to find food, and Napoleon had to rely on exquisite timing to mass his forces in time for battle. The lack of a supply train imparted operational mobility, but when foraging failed, as it did in Russia, or provoked guerrilla war, as it did in Spain, French soldiers starved or were picked off in ambush.<br /><br />The many success of the French Army prompted varying degrees of emulation by the Austrian, Prussian, Russian, and British armies.  The Prussians sought most to copy the French methodology, while the British prefered to enhance the professionalism of their forces rather than build a mass army.<br /><br />Rothenberg wrote \\"The Art of Warfare\\" in 1978.  Close students of the Napoleonic Wars will find a few mistakes, and the volume has a surprising number of misspellings.  However, these imperfections really do not detract from what is an excellent work.<br /><br />This volume is highly recommended to the student looking for a manageable introduction to the Napoleonic Wars, and to the serious student as a superb companion volume to the longer operational-level histories.  The casual reader with some background in military affairs may also find this book a worthwhile read.onic Wars will find a few mistakes, and the volume has a surprising number of misspellings.

Stephen Greenblatt's \\"Will in the World\\" is an unusual but well-written and very effective biography that seeks to place the Bard in the context of his times. Acknowledging up front the paucity of surviving details about Shakespeare's life, Greenblatt starts with known facts about the world in which the playwright lived and works inward. Geenblatt examines such events as the fierce conflict between Protestants and Catholics over religious faith, and by reasonable and plausible logic, links the impact of these events to the known facts of Shakespeare's life and work. Out of this interplay emerges a revealing portrait of Shakespeare as a sensitive but clear-eyed and ambitious man.<br /><br />Greenblatt wastes no time on the long-running academic controversy over whether Shakespeare actually wrote the plays attributed to him. Greenblatts seems confident of the authenticity of Shakespeare's authorship. He brings out that in a world without copyright restrictions, Shakespeare, a gifted writer, was free to follow the custom of the times of borrowing liberally from the works of other playwrights and authors. At the same time, Greenblatt highlights Shakespeare's very original contributions. In Greenblatt's view, Shakespeare overcame a relative lack of formal education through a remarkable ability to learn from his own experiences and those of others.<br /><br />This is a book for the reader already familiar with Shakespeare's work. Greenblatt refers frequently to Shakespeare's plays and poems in a manner that assumes prior knowledge on the part of the reader.<br /><br />This volume is highly recommended to the serious student of Shakespeare's life, to include the nicely concise bibliographic notes at the end. This volume will also appeal to the casual fan of Shakespeare's plays, who for the investment of a little time will learn a good deal about the context in which they were written.	2005-04-21

In it, the Duke of Wellington, at the head of an Anglo-Portuguese-Spanish Army, crosses the French border as part of a larger Allied coalition effort to close out Napoleon's reign as Emperor of France.  Wellington's campaign is paced by a series of on-again, off-again negotiations between Napoleon and the Allied coalition.  A series of victories by Wellington's army over the forces of French Marshal Soult are therefore never quite decisive.  Wellington's army faced formidable challenges fighting on the offensive inside France on difficult terrain amid a nominally hostile population.  Wellington's task is made infinitely easier by Marshal Soult's seeming inability to manage his army in close combat.  Soult is also plagued by the slow wasting of what had once been a veteran army, as enthusiasm for Napoleon dwindles in France.<br /><br />Oman's mastery of his subject and his prose is complete.  The narrative flows smoothly.  His retelling of the second siege of San Sabastian is remarkably vivid, capturing both the heroism and the horror of the final storm of that fortress.  His account of the multi-day Battle of the Nive is clear and easy to follow, while highlighting the remarkable tenacity of the British and Portuguese infantry battalions who withstood a series of French counterattacks at unequal odds.  Oman's trace of the series of combats across southern France is clearer than any recent study.<br /><br />The primary focus of this book is the confrontation between Wellington's army and the principal French army under Marshal Soult, but Oman does not neglect the campaign in Catalonia or the political background to the last nine months of the Peninsular War.  There is a nice concluding essay about the fates of the more prominent generals after the war, as well as an acknowledgement of the messy end of the conflict in Spain.<br /><br />In Volume VII, Oman implicitly assumes that readers are already familiar with the history of the Peninsular War up to through the fall of 1813 and the Battle of the Pyrenees .  Oman wastes no time recapping the story nor does he reintroduce personalities from earlier volumes.  There is just a slight sense that Oman was pushing to complete a project that had already taken nearly thirty years.<br /><br />This volume and series are highly recommended to dedicated readers of the Napoleonic Wars.

The Duke of Wellington's magnificent victory at Salamanca and the subsequent liberation of Madrid shocked the French Imperial Armies into finally concentrating their scattered contingents.  In the face of this mounting danger, Wellington uncharacteristically lost focus.  Leaving a portion of his army to cover Madrid, Wellington became engaged in, even obcessed by the siege of a minor French fortress at Burgos.  While Wellington loitered at Burgos, the separated halves of his army were each menaced by larger, gathering French formations.  Wellington, coming alive at last to the danger, skillfully withdrew his army onto safer ground on the Portuguese frontier.  The numerically superior French were unable to force a decisive battle.<br /><br />Oman suggests that Wellington lacked the forces to truly follow up on the operational possibilities open to him after Salamanca.  It appears also that the siege of Burgos was one of the very few occasions during the Peninsular War when Wellington's intelligence operations failed to provide timely warning of French movements.  Despite the apparent setback, Wellington saved his army to fight another day, while the French lost control of much of Spain in concentrating against his army in 1812.<br /><br />In the spring of 1813, Wellington flanked the French out of their positions in central Spain and into a wholesale retreat to preserve their lines of communication with France.  The retreating French forces stood at Vittoria, where Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese-Spanish Army inflicted another major defeat.<br /><br />By this volume, Oman is a polished master of both his subject and his prose.  His examination of Wellington's generalship is forthright and balanced, highlighting both his skillful operational planning and his less than sure hand conducting sieges.  A highlight of this volume is Oman's account of the Battle of the Pyrenees, almost unique for its clear narrative of a confused multi-day fight along the mountainous Spanish-French border.  This volume and series are highly recommended to dedicated students of the Napoleonic Wars.

In just 300 pages, Holmes presents a balanced, even nuanced view of a man who was both the quintessential military professional and a complex human being.  Through Holmes' efficient prose, we see Wellington as an extradinarily dedicated soldier who mastered his profession in ways few of his contemporaries did, yet who sometimes paid a price on campaign for his insistence on micromanaging his armies.  Wellington comes across as a remarkably honest and duty-bound public servant; as a young man, he was also relentlessly ambitious, and as an older man, sensitive about his military reputation.<br /><br />  Holmes provides some useful insights.  He suggests that exhaustion and strain were responsible for Wellington's uncharacteristically poor performance at the Siege of Burgos in 1812.  Holmes examines the academic dispute over Wellington's relationship with the Prussians during the Waterloo Campaign; he tellingly notes Wellington's responsibilities to his alliance partners and to the British Government and finds that he served both.  Holmes acknowledges Wellington's extramaritial activities but resists the urge to obsess over them or to indulge in psycological speculation.<br /><br />  Serious students of the Duke and of the Napoleonic Wars will find no new scholarship here; indeed, Holmes readily acknowledges his debt to earlier works such as Elizabeth Longford's exceptional biography and Jac Weller's battlefield narrative trilogy.  Holmes has provided an accessible biography for the general reader, supported by well-chosen quotes from the Duke' contemporaries and by a nice selection of illustrations.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended to the general reader with an interest in the man and the era.	2005-03-13

Rory Muir's \\"Tactics and the Experience of Battle in the Age of Napoleon\\" is in many respects an extended version of the chapter on Waterloo in John Keegan's \\"The Face of Battle.\\" Muir, the author of an excellent study of the Battle of Salamanca, draws on a variety of sources to describe how the combat arms of infantry, artillery, and cavalry accomplished their missions on the battlefields of the Napoleonic age. His book also provides insights into the human aspects of battle in that age, including the experience of the individual soldier. Muir's selection of sources is rather British-centric, although he does include some selections from the other major combatants (France, Prussia, Austria, Russia, Spain, for example). Perhaps reflecting the preponderance of British sources, many of the examples derive from the Peninsular War and the Waterloo Campaign.<br /><br />The discussion of tactics is at a fairly basic level, but does presume a general familiarity with the Napoleonic era and especially with the more important battles. There may be no great insights here for serious students of the military art or of the Napoleonic wars, but the book does provide very useful context for understanding the environment in which Napoleonic-era warfare took place. Although lacking the punch of Keegan's writing, Muir's prose is serviceable and easy to follow. Many of the first person accounts he includes are quite moving. The analysis sometimes seems anecdotal rather than systematic; this may have been a function of the limits of the available materials.<br /><br />\\"Tactics and the Experience of Battle in the Age of Napoleon\\" may be most useful as a companion volume to the work of other authors who focus primarily on the strategic and operational levels of war. Muir has provided the astute reader with an appreciation of the capabilities and limitations of the combat arms in that time. Readers unfamiliar with the experience of combat should be forewarned that Muir's book includes some fairly graphic descriptions of the horrors of the Napoleonic battlefield.me fairly graphic descriptions of the horrors of the Napoleonic battlefield.	2005-02-22

Harrison's \\"Cross-Channel Attack\\" is part of the multi-volume official history of the U.S. Army in World War II.  \\"Cross-Channel Attack\\" was first published in 1951, but holds up remarkably well as an operational level history of the planning and execution of Operation Overlord.  Harrison's prose is remarkably readable for an official publication.  His discussion of the long struggle to define and plan D-Day is relatively easy to follow.  Harrison drew on the official records and on interviews with American, British, and German participants when D-Day was still fresh in memory.  The first half of the book describes the long, painful planning process for D-Day, in which American enthusiasm for a direct strike at Hitler's Germany competed with British wariness over the risks and required resources of such an operation.  Harrison's discussion of the long and contentious dialogue is frank but fair to the concerns of both American and British plannners.  The book offers considerable insight into the slowly maturing planning capabilities of the U.S. participants and into the inherent difficulties of plannning such a major operation.  The second half of the book describes the D-Day operation and its immediate aftermath, up through the capture of Cherbourg.  The focus is on the actions of the U.S. First Army.  Harrison sketches portions of the tactical action, for example the struggle of the 101st Airborne Division to take the key town of Carentan, to illustrate the difficulties faced by American forces in taking the Utah and Omaha beachheads and then expanding into the interior of Normandy. Harrison provides appropriate narrative on the German challenges in organizing the defense of northwest France and in attempting to counteract the invasion after 6 June 1944.  It becomes clear in the course of the narrative that the Allies did a remarkable job pulling off an exceptionally difficult operation and that the Germans did themselves few favors in planning and executing their defense.

Infantry battalions from the Guards managed to be present and to serve with distinction at virtually every major battle fought by the Duke of Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese army in the Iberian Peninsula and France, and in the key battles of the Waterloo campaign.  The authors bring a deep familiarity with the Napoleonic era to bear in tightly-written descriptions of the individual battles.  The narrative provides a fairly standard interpretation of events, but even serious students of the era should particularly enjoy the chapter on the heroic defense of the farmhouse of Hougoumont at Waterloo.  The book is lavishly illustrated with portraits, sketches, and diagrams.  The narrow focus on the exploits of the Guards does presuppose some knowledge of the context of the Napoleonic wars; readers seeking a broader perspective should consult one of many general histories available of the Napoleonic wars.  At the same time, the book will be accessible to those readers with at least a casual interest in military affairs.	2005-01-23

The introduction quickly places the reader in the context of the 1808-1814 Peninsular War to liberate Portugal and Spain from the Imperial French Army.  Following are chapters on each of the key battles of the 1811 campaign.<br /><br />Most of the emphasis is on \\"Bloody Albuera\\", a hard-fought encounter in which the clumsy tactical handling of the battle by British General Beresford was redeemed by the initiative of subordinates and the sheer stubborn valor of the British and Portuguese infantry.  The description of the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro and particularly of the role played by Craufurd's celebrated Light Division is almost heartbreakingly vivid.  The Light Division went forward of Wellington's line to cover the retreat of another division, badly mauled by French cavalry.  Although soon surrounded themselves, the \\"light bobs\\" maneuvered so adroitly in and out of square that they denied the French horse any real chance to charge and overrun the otherwise vulnerable infantry.<br /><br />Fletcher nicely mixes battle narrative with short portraits of key leaders and explanations of battle tactics.  The narrative is closely supported by illustrations and sketches of the battle action and color plates of uniforms.  This book should especially appeal to the student of the history of the British Army and of the Napoleonic Wars.  The interpretation of events is standard and British-centric; those seeking a broader perspective should consult Oman's seven volume \\"History of the Peninsular War\\" or David Gates' single volume \\"The Spanish Ulcer.\\"  The casual reader may find the density of detail to be daunting.	2005-01-23

Gleig's perspective is that of a junior officer; his narrative of battles interspersed between periods of inactivity and mundane survival in the field will be familar to veterans and to students of military life in the Napoleonic era.  He provides an intimate look in clear and simple prose at the day-to-day conduct of business at the regimental level.  His description of the Siege of San Sebastian in northeast Spain is particularly vivid.  Those who follow Bernard Cornwall's \\"Sharpe\\" series may find this an interesting factual counterpoint, as might those overwhelmed by the strategic/operational focus of most histories of the era.  The casual reader without some background of the Peninsular War or of military life may find this work difficult to follow.	2005-01-23

Weller's writing style is that of an accomplished storyteller.  Weller traveled extensively over the battlefields of that long war, and his understanding of the terrain closely informs a series of excellent battle narratives.  Weller is especially strong in his descriptions of Napoleonic tactics and of the limitations of weaponry.  Be warned: Weller was an unabashed fan of the Duke, who receives very little criticism in this book.  It is fair to note that Weller doesn't spend a lot of time on the operational or strategic context of the battles.  Weller also has very little to say about events happening away from the Anglo-British Army.  Readers looking for a more comprehenisive history of the Peninsular War should check out David Gates' single volume history \\"The Spanish Ulcer\\" or Charles Oman's definitive seven volume \\"History of the Peninsular War.\\"  This is an entertaining historical read for the serious student and perhaps for the casual reader as well.	2005-01-16

It is best read as part of that trilogy.  Weller writes in clear, easy to understand, and usually entertaining prose.  He has an excellent grasp of the importance of terrain, and writes better than most about the details of tactics and weapons.  His understanding of Wellington enables him to provide a narrative of the conduct of the Battle of Waterloo from Wellington's changing perspective as commander over time.  This perspective allows Weller to impose order on the chaos of the battlefield for the general reader.  Be warned that Weller was an unabashed fan of Wellington and wastes very little ink on the various academic controversies about the battle.  Diehard fans of the military genius of Napoleon should seek elsewhere.  Weller breaks no new ground with this book; his interpretation follows standard lines.  Those looking for an entertaining and understandable narrative of the battlefield should find this a good read.	2005-01-16

Gates addresses the actions of the Imperial French, the struggles of the Spanish politicians, armies and guerillas, and the fiasco of Portugal prior to the British intervention.  That Gates manages to do in one volume what Charles Oman required seven volumes to cover is, however, both a strength and a weakness.  On the one hand, students of the era now have a single reasonably comprehensive summary of the Peninsular War phase.  On the other hand, of necessity, much of the detail of a very complex conflict is compressed, while the narrative tends to jump from place to place.  Some advance knowledge of the conflict is almost required to make sense of the many moving parts.  Unfortunately, the maps provided in the text are not well designed and more confusing than helpful.  Readers are advised to track the action on their own large map of the Iberian Peninsula.  This book is strongly recommended to those with an interest in the Peninsular War but not the time or energy to work through the longer studies.	2005-01-16

Arthur Bryant's \\"The Great Duke\\" is a well-written and very readable military biography of the Duke of Wellington.  Bryant follow's Wellington's career from his youth in Ireland through his early military experiences in northern Europe to his exploits in India to his almost legendary achievements in the Peninsular War, to his last and perhaps most important battle at Waterloo in 1815.<br /><br />Wellington emerges from this portrait as a military professional in the most modern sense, a man who mastered tactics, logistics, intelligence, operational planning, and diplomacy to a degree that few if any of his contemporaries matched.  Wellington's most extraordinary performance may be his conduct of the Peninsular War, commanding Britain's only large deployable force, days by sea from the British Isles and employed in a theater of war where it was typically outnumbered by its French opponents.  Wellington and his army survived five years of combat thanks to his disciplined use of his forces, his painstaking approach to logistics, his general effective diplomacy with allies, and above all, his ruthless application of common sense.  In the long view, Wellington succeeded to an extraordinary degree in translating London's strategic policy into battlefield success.<br /><br />Although the author comes to praise Wellington and not to bury him, the Duke does not escape criticism.  Among other faults, Wellington had neither time nor patience for his subordinates.  His reluctance, outside of a small handful of senior officers, to trust and empower his subordinates, meant that Wellington had to run virtually every battle in person.  This book is highly recommended to the student and the general reader interested in Wellington and the Napoleonic wars.	2005-01-16

They are a distillation of Jac Weller's understanding of the Duke developed by years of study and tramping his various battlefields.  The best essays are those which summarize Wellington's use of logistics, engineers, intelligence, and irregular foces in India, Portugal and Spain.  There are lessons here for the modern military professional.  The essay comparing India with the Vietnam War seems forced and badly dated.  The exploration of the impact of Wellington's legacy on the conduct of the Civil War is intriguing but extremely cursory.  As with his other work, Jac Weller's writing style is simple and easy to understand.  This book does presuppose knowledge of the Napoleonic era and of Weller's earlier work, and is therefore best read as a companion volume to Weller's trilogy on the Duke of Wellington in India, in the Iberian Peninsula, and at Waterloo.	2005-01-16

In \\"The Man Who Broke Napoleon's Codes\\", Urban places Scovell's personal story in the context primarily of the Peninsular War.  Urban manages to reduce the fairly esoteric work of code-breaking to understandable prose, in the process providing excellent insights into the workings of Wellington's staff and into the Duke's command style.  The availability of intelligence is shown to be crucial to the survival and success of the outnumbered Anglo-Portuguese Army in the Iberian Peninsula.  Wellington's success in attacking the separate pieces of the French Army in Spain while avoiding larger concentrations was based on his understanding of their movements and intentions, derived from the reconnaissance of British officers and Spanish guerrillas, and especially from the deciphering of captured French dispatches.  Urban is evenhanded in his treatment of the principal characters.  Scovill himself emerges as a sympathetic character, a hardworking staff officer of lower class social origins trying to make his way in an Army hierarchy informally based on social position.  This book is highly recommended for the serious student of the Napoleonic Wars looking for insight into intelligence matters.  Remarkably, this book will also be accessible to the casual reader, thanks to Urban's clear and engaging writing style.	2005-01-16

Midway	Scott McGaugh's \\"Midway Magic\\" is a very readable collection of recollections about the career of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Midway.  The Midway was launched at the close of World War II, retired after the first Gulf War, and present at a remarkable number of Cold War crises and conflicts.  McGaugh has assembled a series of vignettes based on oral history interviews, letters, and recollections by former crew members and arranged them in chronological order.  They provide insights into the very human, often humorous, and sometimes heartbreaking aspects of life in the Navy at sea.  Strictly speaking, this is not a true history of the Midway, as McGaugh makes no real effort to integrate or provide perspective on what are the opinions of individuals with necessarily limited fields of view on events.  That said, those who served in the Navy in those years, and those who waited for them on shore, will recognize much that was true about life in the Navy duirng the Cold War.  McGaugh does a remarkable job keeping the vignettes jargon-free and therefore within the reach of the average reader.  This is a worthwhile read for the Navy veteran, for the student of naval warfare looking for some insights into the human factor, and for the casual reader with an interest in the Navy.	2005-01-16

The book in battlefield level detail sketches the future Duke's 1797-1805 campaigning against a variety of native opponents.  The battlefield narratives are closely informed by Weller's understanding the terrain, based on having walked all the principal battlefields.  In addition, Weller lays out the complex political environment in which the young Wellesley operated.  What emerges from this portrait is a young, ambitious, and professional officer who operates with increasing confidence and success in a challenging battlefield and political environment.  From his experiences in India comes the future Duke's understanding of the importance of logistics, intelligence, planning, and the careful deployment of well-trained troops on the battlefield.  Wellesley's long apprenticeship in India and later in the Peninsular War of 1808-1814 made him a master of battlefield tactics and operational-level planning, skills that would serve him well in the decisive battle of Waterloo in 1815 against Napoleon.  This book is highly recommended to the serious student of Wellington's military career and of the Napoleonic era.	2005-01-16

In an engaging narrative studded with bold and often critical portraits of key personalities such as Mussolini, Eisenhower, Rommel, and Montgomery, Porch describes the theater from Gibralter to Baghdad.<br /><br />Porch's theme is that far from being a diversion of resources from a decisive Allied confrontation with Hitler in Northwest Europe, the Mediterranean theater was the vital path to victory.  For the British immediately after Dunkirk and the surrender of France, the Mediterranean was the only theater of operations where the British could marshal the forces to effectively counter first Italian and then German military designs on the lifelines of empire.  After the entry of the United States into the war, the Mediterranean became the only theater in which the United States could reasonably conduct ground operations against Germany while building the competence of green troops and commanders in modern warfare and while forging the great alliance with the British.  For Italy and especially for Germany, the Med created huge demands on military forces that might have found better, even decisive use on the Eastern Front and after June 1944, in France.<br /><br />Porch provides a vivid narrative of the growing pains of the British and American militaries in North Africa and Italy, but he also makes clear the link to later successes in Northwest Europe.  His commentary on the struggles of the French to re-enter the war are covered in a detail and with a sensitivity I have not seen elsewhere in English.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for the serious student of the Second World War.  The casual reader will find it very long at over 600 pages, and filled with occasionaly dense commentary on various longstanding academic disputes over the conduct and personalties of WWII.

Joseph Ellis' biography of George Washington goes beyond a simple recounting of the known facts of Washington's life.  The author has set for himself the much tougher task of determining what made George Washington the man he was.  Along the way, Ellis, author of several other revolutionary biographies, provides some vital context in which to judge the challenges faced by a young Washington and the way he overcame those challenges.<br /><br />What emerges from \\"His Excellency\\" is a Washington who wrestled with ambition and with moral leadership.  The young Wahington learned hard lessons on the Virginia frontier as a surveyor and later as a leader of Virginia milita troops, and still more as an aide to a British general in a French and Indian War campaign that went badly.  Other lessons followed, as a prominent planter, as a member of the Virginia legislature, and as a leader of the Revolution.  At the end of the day, Ellis finds, as most of his countrymen did, that Washington was the right man in the right place to lead the Revolutionary Army and to be first president.  His careful balancing of ambition and morality left a legacy of restraint not always followed by his successors.  Ellis's portrait is not always flattering; it is perhaps best read in conjunction with other studies; recommended.	2004-12-27

The last half of the book centers on the defense of Bjorn West against a German counterinsurgency campaign while the resistance was attempting to negotiate the surrender of German forces in Norway.  Nielson describes the difficulties of life on the run from the German occupation forces in the snow-covered mountains of western Norway.  He provides intimate details of the harsh life of the resistance fighters, holed up in small, drafty cabins in the high mountains, dependent upon airdrops of supplies from Great Britain to feed and arm themselves.  He also provides a sense of the challenges for the Norwegian resistance of being outnumbered by the German occupation force and of being under some restraints in its actions to avoid provoking retaliatory atrocities by the Germans against Norwegian civilians.  What emerges is a vivid portrait of the patriotism and valor of the Norwegians under terrible circumstances, and of their sustaining partnership with the Allied leadership in Great Britain.  This book will appeal to students of the Second World War, especially those interested in national resistance, and to those with ties to Norway.  The book does presuppose some knowledge of the Second World War and some familiarity with the challenging geography of western Norway.  It is a translation from Norwegian and the language can appear awkward in a few places.  Nielson includes some wonderful photographs illustrating the terrain and the men with whom he served.  I highly recommend this book as a counterpoint to the numerious histories of conventional combat in the Second World War.	2004-12-22

It is derivative of her full-length biographies of Wellington and Queen Victoria but manages to be solidly informative without being overwhelming.  Longford, in highly readable prose, provides a fast moving survey of the military and political life of Arthur Wellesley, weaving in the kinds of personal details that hang a more human face on a man and a time much mythologized.  This work is clearly intended for the general reader; serious students of the Duke should track down Longford's two volume biography (\\"Years of the Sword\\" and \\"Pillar of the State\\").  Those looking for a detailed military biography should also seek elsewhere; this volume only lightly skims the surface of Wellington's long military career.  This is the kind of book a serious student of Wellington provides as an introduction to the subject to his less serious friends and relatives.	2004-12-22

Rory Muir's \\"Salamanca 1812\\" is a detailed, even blow-by-blow description of the encounter in western Spain between Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese Army and Marmot's Imperial French Army, ending in a decisive battlefield victory for the Allies.  After a brief synopsis of events in the Peninsular War leading up to the battle, Muir guides the reader through each phase of manuever by both sides.  He provides special focus on the key attack by the Anglo-Portuguese forces that broke the French forces.  Muir intermingles commentary on various points of scholarly controversy with the battlefield narrative. Muir's writing style is easy to follow, especially in the details of the encounters between units.  The diagrams illustrating maneuver look stylized and could have been a little clearer.  At book's end, he might have have devoted an additional couple of pages to his rather cursory summary of the mixed strategic results of the battle.  This is a book meant for serious scholars and devoted fans of the Peninsular War.  Readers with an interest in the operational level of war will find the commentary on Wellington's remarkable display of patience in waiting for his opportunity to fight to be very worthwhile.  However, the average reader may find the mixture of narrative and commentary to be distracting, and the level of detail to be somewhat overwhelming.  Muir is clearly a master of his topic and has produced a very worthwhile read.	2004-12-19

The Battle of Waterloo has been very heavily worked by both historians and writers of fiction over the years.  In \\"Waterloo-A Near Run Thing\\", David Howarth offers the average reader a fascinating account of that decisive battle at a very human level,and without an overload of technical jargon or scholarly controversy.  Working from the perspective of information available as the battle unfolded, Howarth weaves together commentary from persons who were present at the battle with just enough narrative to keep the story moving along.  He provides enough details on tactics, equipment, and personalities to make the narrative understandable.  The result is a book that puts a human face on a now long-distant event without adding another layer of mythology.  Howarth's diagrams and illustrations of the battle are well-chosen to support the narrative.  Although this book presents no new or dramatic information about the Battle of Waterloo, Howarth's solid prose and imaginative organization will also make it a pleasant read for the serious student of the Napoleonic Wars.  The paperback edition is a perfect size for a long trip or vacation.	2004-12-19

This reader cannot judge the book's value as an on-the-ground tour guide to battlefields in Portugal, Spain, and France.  However, it is a good overview of the actions of the British Army in the Peninsular War.  Three hundred pages may seem long, but most of the serious studies of the war are much longer.  The book provides a good survey-level account, describing in broad brush the sequence of battles and campaigns from the initial British intervention in 1808 to the final battles in southern France before the first abdication of Napoleon in 1814.  Wellington's role rightly receives prominent coverage, but Robertson does not neglect Moore's ill-fated 1808-1809 expedition. Robertson's writing style is easy to follow, and is augmented with well-chosen quotes from witnesses to the campaigns.  The text is enhanced with an excellent collection of pictures which put faces to the principal personalities, and maps and sketches which provide a sense of the difficult terrain over which the war was fought.  Serious students of the Napoleonic Wars will find no revelations here, but the casual reader may find this a very manageable single volume account.	2004-12-05

It is instead a rather original hybrid of biography, political and military history, and for lack of a better word, gossip.  Roberts focuses on the parrallels in the careers of Napoleon and Wellington; there are remarkable similarities and differences. At the center of the narrative is the fact that Napoleon and Wellington, as the foremost military personalities of their time, were placed in a position of natural rivalry.  Each was in many respects the standard against which the other was measured. Roberts, in an engaging style, brings out the perceptions (and misperceptions) each had of the other, and how these perceptions changed over time, especially after the Battle of Waterloo.  For the serious reader, there are some insights into the personalities of the two leaders that help explain their respective approaches to the battlefield.  For example, Roberts brings out the value for Wellington of his extensive tactical experience with infantry in India and the Peninsular War, which allowed him to personally and usefully intervene in the conduct of his battles.  By contrast, Napoleon's far more rapid rise in rank left him with less experience in tactics and therefore more dependent on his marshals for the conduct of his battles.  Roberts highlights that Wellington was primarily a military leader who saw himself as an agent of the British Governemnt; Napoleon's perspective was that of a head of state in pursuit of his own vision of glory, for which his leadership of the French Armies was a means to an end.  Serious readers looking for battle history should seek elsewhere.  For the more casual reader, there are plenty of juicy personal tidbits of the kind normally found on the personality page of the weekly Parade Magazine.  These details tend to humanize two personalities long layered in myth.  Roberts is to be commended for finding a original angle to ground that has been heavily worked.for finding a original angle to ground that has been heavily worked.	2004-12-05

Napoleon's France makes a supreme effort to consolidate its conquest of Spain and to drive the British Army out of Portugal, and fails.  Stubborn Spanish resistance outlasts both battlefield defeats and painful shortfalls in organization and leadership.  Portugal withstands a full-blooded French invasion led by the experienced Marshal Massena.  The key to Portugal's survival is Welligton's cold-eyed understanding of what a successful defense will require, and his patience and ruthlessness in carrying out his plan.  His skillful use of the Anglo-Portuguese Army and his far-sighted mobilization of the whole resources of the Kingdom of Portugal is just enough to cause a French defeat.  Highlights of this volume include the great Anglo-Portuguese defensive victory at Bussaco, and the defense of the Lines of Torres Vedras.  Oman provides a balanced yet detailed narrative at the operational level of war of events in both Portugal and Spain.  Those looking for vivid battlefield should seek elsewhere; Oman is not a master of the battlefield tactics of the period, nor is that his primary focus.  This volume was first published in 1908; readers should be forewarned that Oman writes in an older style that takes some getting used to.  This series by Oman on the Peninsular War continues to be the standard work against which all others are measured.	2004-11-15

The first half of the book lays the ground work by an extended discussion of Confederate intelligence and covert action activities.  This discussion highlights the difficulties of reconstructing activities that were highly secret and poorly documented, especially in the chaos of the closing months of the Civil War.  The second half of the book is the application of what is known about the Confederate secret service to the events around Lincoln's assassination.  What emerges is a more richly nuanced explanation of those events, in which an extended effort to orchestrate Lincoln's kidnapping becomes an assassination plot after the fall of Richmond in April 1865.  The gaps in the record, based both on the passage of time and the secrecy in which these actions would have been carried out means the authors must often imply or suggest links in their explanation based on their characterization of the assassination as an organized secret service mission.  The motley band of misfits led by an allegedly insane actor found in traditional histories are in this version replaced by a purpose built organization recruited, financed, and directed to some significant degree by the Confederate Secret Service.  The authors' explanation is reasonable and plausible, if not fully documented.  The writing in this book is sometimes tedious and repetitive, and will be of most interest to serious students of the Civil War and especially of Lincoln's assassination.  This book will be of particular interest to those with a background in intelligence or special operations; indeed, a full understanding of the book almost presupposes such a background.  Those who choose to favor exotic conspiracy theories about the Lincoln assassination will be disappointed; Tidwell and his fellow authors prefer simpler explanations.r simpler explanations.	2004-10-31

Michael Glover's very readable military biography of the Duke of Wellington follows the arc of his career in uniform from the Netherlands campaign of 1793-95, through the Danish expedition, the long service in India, and the years of the Peninsular War, to the Waterloo campaign of 1815 and the day of days at Mont St. Jean.  Glover's intent is to place the Duke in the context of the British Army, and the British politics, of his time.<br /><br />Glover spends some time describing the inefficient British military establishment of Wellington's day, one more designed to keep internal order than to conduct expeditionary warfare.  In particular, the author provides some insights into the interaction between a deployed commander such as Wellington and his political masters in London, who might be days, weeks, or even months away.  Very often, time and distance factors placed enormous responsibility on commanders such as Wellington to translate necessarily vague guidance into concrete objectives.<br /><br />The author finds Wellington to have been a remarkably professional officer who was perhaps less an innovator than someone who could make the system work, and who excelled at battlefield tactics but also at the essentials such as logistics and intelligence.  Glover's solid prose, studded with nuggets of detail, should be interesting to readers with at least a casual interest in the man and his context. Well recommended.	2004-10-10

While some key battles are described, the focus of this history is on policy and strategy for resourcing and employing the British Army.  There is associated discussion of politics internal and external to the Army as they relate to the formulation of policy and strategy.  The chapters on the First and Second World Wars are particularly well written.  Those readers closely following current U.S. policy and strategy in the War on Terrorism will find interesting parrallels in the role of the British Army in safeguarding the Empire through a series of low and medium intensity conflicts.  Those interested in defense transformation will find some interesting perspectives in the British struggle to rationalize the role of the Army since the end of the Cold War.	2004-09-27

This is the second volume of Oman's essential seven part history of the Peninsular War, picking up the story after the evacuation of Sir John Moore's British force from Corunna.  It provides a comprehensive account at an operational level of war of the struggles of the Spanish to form a coherent resistence to the French invasion of Spain, and of the French to complete their conquest of Spain and Portugal.  The last portion of this volume includes the return of a British expeditionary force, led by Sir Arthur Wellesley, to the Iberian Peninsula.  Oman's discussion of Wellesley's vision of his mission is remarkable both for its clarity and for the manner in which it frames the subsequent British campaigning.  Oman's scholarship is somewhat dated (this volume was originally published in 1903).  He is not especially strong on tactical details; those seeking a blow-by-blow account of battles will do better elsewhere.  Overall, this volume is highly recommended to the reader with a serious interest in this phase of the Napoleonic Wars.  It will also be of interest to military scholars looking for historical information on the challenges of coalition warfare and stability operations.	2004-09-26

In this, the fourth volume of Oman's definitive history of the Peninsular War, the author truly hits his stride.  More recent histories may have new details or the benefit of different perspective, but Oman's multivolume series is still the starting point for all serious study of this conflict.  Oman writes in a older style that takes a little getting used to, but he has a superb understanding of the strategic and operational levels of war.  His work captures the broad sweep and complexity of a key phase of the Napoleonic Wars.  If the narrative tends to be British-centric in places, he does provide evenhanded coverage of all the major players, whether British, French, Portuguese, or Spanish.  His narrative in early books on tactical detail was sometimes a little vague; in the descriptions of the key battles of Fuentes de Onoro and Albuera, he has made good that earlier weakness.<br />This series is highly recommended for the serious student with lots of time to read.  The casual reader may find it both long and challenging.	2004-08-18
