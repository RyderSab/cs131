Books	5	57	58	N	N	Important Reading for Parents and Teens	Growing up Christian is not as easy a task as one might think. There are dangers and temptations unique to growing up within a Christian family and within the church and sadly these difficulties are often downplayed or misunderstood by those who have been converted later in life. Growing Up Christian seeks examine these issues, which, as a person who grew up in a Christian home (ie a \\"church kid\\"), are near and dear to my heart. The book is targetted primarily at church kids, though their parents would do well to read the book with them. The author, Karl Graustein, is a church kid himself and is now a principal at a Christian school, so is intimately aware of the issues at stake.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections. The first lays out the blessings and the dangers of growing up in a Christian family. \\"Growing up in a Christian home is a wonderful privilege. We have been given so much: godly parents, training in the Word of God, friends from Christian homes, support from a Christian church community, and most importantly an opportunity to know God at a young age. Throughout our lives, we are repeatedly taught about the love of God, his plan of salvation, ways to recognize and resist sin, and living for the glory of God\\" (page 21). He goes on to recount other benefits of being raised in a Christian environment, pointing out that while we are given so much we are also protected from so many dangers.<br /><br />\\"Church kids face some unique challenges...Though surrounded by the things of God, we can still be drawn to sin and live double lives. We can easily assume that we are saved even if we are not; or we may be driven by a desire to be popular more than a desire to live according to biblical values. While it is a great blessing to grow up in a Christian environment, if we are not careful we can make some dangerous assumptions about ourselves, which have serious consequences\\" (page 22).<br /><br />I can testify from my life that I have seen both the privilege and the danger of growing up in a Christian home. I am ever thankful to God that He blessed me with discerning parents who, though they did not understand from their own experience what it is like to be a church kid, were unrelenting in sharing the gospel with us. Their efforts have been blessed as all five of their children know and serve the Lord. But as often as I have seen this type of blessing, I have seen the opposite, where the children of Christians fall away or live lukewarm at best, always assuming but never knowing that they are saved.<br /><br />The second section teaches kids how to think biblically. Graustein speaks of the importance of cultivating humility, of growing in gratefulness, of loving Scripture and of trusting God. He also covers what I might consider the most important topic in the book: developing personal biblical convictions. On the front cover of the book are the words, \\"Have you taken ownership of your relationship with God?\\" Just this weekend I was discussing this topic with my friend Doug and I suggested that this is exactly what the children of Christians need to do. For many years we coast along under the umbrella of our parents' faith. We do what they do and say what they say simply because that is what we have been taught. But there comes a time of crisis and decision. This is a time I remember from my own life. I do not know whether this is the moment I became a Christian or whether that was much earlier, but I do clearly remember the day that God allowed me to make my parents' faith my own. It was a day of transformation in my life. It is a day that I suspect all church kids have at some point.<br /><br />The final section deals with living biblically and the author discusses battling sin, the spiritual disciplines and stewardship of God-given talents. Much of this section draws upon and is consistent with the excellent teaching ministry of Don Whitney and his book Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life. Other clear influences on the author through this section and others are J.C. Ryle, John Piper, Jerry Bridges and C.J. Mahaney. Graustein is clearly a man who has spent much time in the Word and much time learning from sound teachers.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a fantastic book and one which I wish I had been able to read while I was a teenager still wrestling with my faith. To echo the endorsement of Tedd Tripp, \\"Karl Graustein gets it! He understands the pitfalls and dangers that track with the privilege of growing up in a Christian home. He addresses all the standard temptations...This book has a look and feel that young people will appreciate.\\" Growing Up Christian is a book I would unhesitatingly recommend to any and all Christian parents and teens.<br /><br />This is a bit unusual, but I'd like to make special mention of the person who designed the cover for this book. It is very well done and I suspect this book will sell quite a few copies to those who judge a book by its cover. Well done! If there are awards for this type of thing I hope you receive consideration.Other clear influences on the author through this section and others are J.C. Ryle, John Piper, Jerry Bridges and C.J.

I am of the generation whose grandfathers fought in the war and I have always been proud of the contributions made by members of my family. My maternal grandfather, Lawrence Belford, wished to fly bombers but was not permitted because of poor eyesight. Still, he served the Royal Canadian Air Force as a member of the ground crew, loading bombs into Lancaster bombers. He would often recount his memories of the war and at one point I even conducted an interview with him. My grandmother's brother, Harold, was a Spitfire pilot who lost his life in a mission over the Mediterranean. My paternal grandfather, George Challies, whom I never met, was a Lieutenant Colonel and I am unsure of his contribution, though I believe he commanded an artillery training centre in Quebec. When I was in college I majored in history (my minor was in euchre) and took every possible course that centered around the war years. While I have since turned to other interests I continue to have a fascination with the war and read about it as often as I am able.<br /><br />This fascination led me to read &lt;em>War and Grace: Short Biographies from the World Wars&lt;/em>, a book of brief biographies written by Don Stephens. The thirteen biographies have one thing in common - the subjects are all Christians. A few of these people were believers long before the war began, while others were converted during or after the war.<br /><br />What I found particularly interesting is that I knew of many of the people whose lives are examined in this book, yet I had no idea that they had become Christians. For example, anyone who has studied the war knows of Mitsuo Fuchida who was the chief pilot for the Japanese in the attack on Pearl Harbour. He is famous for giving the signal to attack and then crying \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!, the codeword to indicate that the Japanese had achieved complete surprise. But what fewer know, I'm sure, is that after the war he became a believer and spent the rest of his life in passionate, fruitful ministry to the Lord.<br /><br />Years after the war Fuchida crossed paths with another subject of this book, Jacob DeShazer, one of the Doolittle Raiders who spent several years in Japanese custody after his plane crashed. In prison he was given a Bible and in his autobiography he writes, \\"On June 8th, 1944, the words of Romans 10:9 stood out boldly before my eyes: 'If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.' In that very moment God gave me grace to confess my sins to him, and he forgave me and saved me for Jesus' sake...\\" After the war DeShazer became a missionary and spent much of his life ministering in Japan. His ministry continues to this day.<br /><br />The final chapter was the one I found most fascinating. The author writes about Henry Gerecke who was the Protestant (Lutheran) chaplain to the Nazi war criminals during their trial at Nuremberg. Dedicating many months to sharing the gospel with these men, he was blessed to see several of the highest ranking Nazis, men whose crimes live in infamy even today, humble themselves before God. I am sure very few have learned in school that among the last words of Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler's foreign minister, were, \\"I place all my confidence in the Lamb who made atonement for my sins. May God have mercy on my soul.\\" He then turned to Gerecke and said, \\"I'll see &lt;em>you&lt;/em> again.\\"<br /><br />Part of the beauty of this book is that Stephens writes with a Reformed understanding of conversion. He clearly sought out more than just good stories, but looked in particular for stories of true conversion. He leaves little doubt about those who gave their lives to Christ. The theology in this book is deep and satisfying.<br /><br />So I suppose this book came as a surprise to me. I knew many of the people, but I knew them only from secular texts which had nointerest in the spiritual dimensions of their lives. To learn of the deep faith of these people, faith that was often formed and tested in the most difficult of circumstances, was a very pleasant surprise. I highly recommend it.which had no interest in the spiritual dimensions of their lives.

US	43519458	R3AWBYBJ0SRKRJ	0801027977	973781768	Is the Reformation Over?: An Evangelical Assessment of Contemporary Roman Catholicism	Books	2	47	91	N	N	What Is The Cost of Unity?	This is actually the second part of a review I posted at my own web site. I trust it will still convey my thoughts on the book.<br /><br />I would like to preface my analysis by expressing that the authors displayed a clear bias throughout the book. Mark Noll is an evangelical, and I believe Carolyn Nystrom is as well, and in this book they spend a great deal of time expressing harsh criticism of evangelicalism. While I am Protestant and am perhaps being sensitive, it seems that they did not return the harsh rhetoric towards the Roman Catholic Church. We can see this bias displayed in the chapter discussing conversion from one tradition to another. In this section the authors provided several examples of evangelicals who converted to Catholicism, but no examples of conversion from Catholicism to Protestantism. This type of conversion is, in my experience, far more common and my church stands as an example. It is probably safe to say that our church is primarily composed of former Roman Catholics who left their church and then became believers. The bias is also clear in the chapter discussing ecumenical dialogues. The authors blame evangelicals for expressing anti-Catholic beliefs, but they provide no similar evidence for anti-Protestantism. They also provide no historical framework of persecution and Inquisition to show why Protestants expressed such distrust of the Catholic Church. Thus the reader needs to understand that this book expresses harsh attitudes towards Protestantism without corresponding harshness towards Roman Catholicism.<br /><br />Minimizing Theological Considerations<br /><br />Throughout the book the reader will note that the authors continually minimize theological considerations. Their overarching argument, as I expressed in the introduction to this review, is that the core disagreement between evangelicals and Roman Catholics is ecclesiology. This allows Noll and Nystrom to minimize theological disagreements as being of secondary importance. The authors' main strategy is not to thoroughly examine each point of doctrine where evangelicals disagree with Catholics (and sometimes vice versa), but to prove that issues over which Protestants often express concern are merely minor considerations in the larger area of the nature of the church. \\"In sum,\\" they say, \\"the central difference that continues to seperate evangelicals and Catholics is not Scripture, justification by faith, the pope, Mary, the sacraments or clerical celibacy - though the central difference is reflected in differences on these matters - but the nature of the church\\" (page 237). If the reader does not agree with that premise, he will likely not agree with most of the author's major conclusions.<br /><br />Issues Not Addressed<br /><br />It is clear that in a book of this size the authors cannot address every theological issue that seperates Protestant from Catholic. Yet there were at least two major disagreements that received no attention. The first of these is purgatory. The Catechism, which the authors often quote favorably, has this to say about purgatory: \\"All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven.\\" Needless to say, purgatory is a view that cannot be supported by a Protestant, biblical understanding of salvation. Purgatory calls into question the sufficiency of Jesus' suffering, for how effective was Christ's death if it needs to be supplemented by our own suffering? Did not Jesus die so that we did not need to suffer this type of torment?<br /><br />A second issue, and one that is perhaps even more important, has to do with the Eucharist. The authors deal in some depth with transubstatiation in which the bread and wine become the real presence of Christ. Yet this is not the most significant concern posed by the mass. Of far more importance is the understanding of the mass being a propitiation for sin. Protestants, having searched the Scriptures, believe that Christ's sacrifice was made once and had perfect, total efficacy. It does not need to be further supplemented or repeated in any way. Yet the Roman Catholic Church teaches that each celebration of the mass is a new, propitiatory sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />These two issues are of critical importance, for they call into question the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice. Despite this, the authors overlook them altogether.<br /><br />The Fundamentals<br /><br />Phil Johnson recently posted an article written by John MacArthur entitled \\"Essential Christianity, not 'Mere Christianity'.\\" This article discussed the fundamentals of Christianity. MacArthur summarizes a Protestant understanding of the difficulties involved in attaining ecumenical unity. \\"Certainly any list of fundamentals would have to begin with these doctrines Scripture explicitly identifies as nonnegotiable: the absolute authority of Scripture over tradition (sola Scriptura), justification by faith alone (sola fide), the deity of Christ, and the Trinity.\\" While Roman Catholics and Protestants are able to agree on some of these issues, such as the deity of Christ and the Trinity, there are others where a vast chasm remains (justification by faith alone and the absolute authority of Scripture over tradition).<br /><br />There are several places in the book where the authors examine these issues in general, and justification in particular, and declare that there is no longer any critical difference between the Catholic and Protestant understandings of these pivotal issues. \\"If it is true, as once was repeated frequently by Protestants conscious of their anchorage in Martin Luther or John Calvin that iustificatio articulus stantis vel cadentis ecclesiae (justification is the article on which the church stands or falls), then the Reformation is over\\" (page 232). Time and space fail me to provide a detailed apologetic for the Protestant understanding of justification, but suffice it to say that the authors do nothing - absolutely nothing - to prove that an informed understanding of the biblical view of justification is now shared between Protestant and Catholic. In fact, the discerning reader will wonder whether the authors even truly understand the Protestant view of justification. Clever wording and ambiguous statements in ecumenical dialogue does not constitute change within the Catholic Church. Perhaps a repeal of the anathemas of the Council of Trent, anathemas which were affirmed at Vatican II, would prove that change had occured. But as it stands in official Roman Catholic statements of theology, the crucial differences remain.<br /><br />What of Scripture?<br /><br />Conspicuous by its absence is any real examination of Catholic or Protestant theology in light of the Scripture. There are very few quotes from the Bible and certainly very few attempts to examine either system of doctrine through the Bible. Page 248 finds the authors defending Catholicism by showing that the traditional complaints against Catholicism now exist in Protestantism. But what of Scripture, our guide? Writing, as they are, for a Protestant audience, it seems that proving all things from Scripture would advance their argument. Yet, it appears, they are unable to do so. We see this also in the discussion of justification. \\"The Roman Catholic Church now [post-Vatican II] articulates positions on salvation - even on justification by faith - that are closer to the main teachings of the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation than are the beliefs of many Protestants, indeed, of many evangelical Protestants. Strange as it may seem to put it this way, the ECT documents present what can only be called a classically orthodox depiction of Christian salvation, primarily because they empahsize and build upon these official Catholic teachings\\" (page 180). But again, what of Scripture? Should we not allow Scripture to be our guide as we examine these issues?<br /><br />The Arguments<br /><br />The endorsements for this book would lead the reader to believe that it represents a high level of scholarship. J.I. Packer says, \\"Here is superb thelogical journalism.\\" David Wells writes that \\"This book offers a superbly researched, documented and engagingly argued case...\\" While the book does represent interesting research, I found the argumentation unconvincing. At the beginning of the fifth chapter the authors write, \\"Comments such as the following are heard frequently when evangelical Protestants talk about Catholicism\\" (page 115). They go on to list six comments, including \\"There is much I admire about the Catholic faith. But Catholics think Mary is a god, and the pope is their dictator - and then there is the whole question of celibacy;\\" \\"The people in my Baptist Sunday school class think that the Catholic Church is a cult. Should I argue about that?;\\" \\"Do Catholics believe they Bible? Are they allowed to read it?;\\" \\"I wish Catholics believed in grace. How can you be a Christian if you don't believe in salvation by grace through faith?\\" It seems to me that people who ask such basic, uneducated questions may be convinced by this book. Protestants who have created a mere caricature of Roman Catholic theology and practice may well be convinced. But those who have researched the issues and know the heart of the disagreement will remain unswayed.<br /><br />Is the Reformation Over?<br /><br />In the final analysis, the authors have failed to understand the core disagreement between Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church. There are clearly important disagreements about ecclesiology, and these are disagreements that are unlikely to be reconciled until Protestants are willing to accept the papacy. But there is a far deeper disagreement. At the heart of the Reformation was the gospel, which, incidentally, is a word and concept the authors use only rarely. The gospel message of justification by grace alone through faith alone, despite the authors' insistence to the contrary, is not present in official Roman Catholic doctrine. I have little doubt that there are some, perhaps many, within the Church who are truly saved. But Roman doctrine is as opposed to biblical theology today as it was during the Reformation.<br /><br />Is the Reformation Over? proves that Protestants and Catholics can, indeed, enjoy unity. But this unity must be at the expense of the gospel. We can embrace Roman Catholicism as a faithful expression of biblical faith, and enjoy ecumenical unity, but it will cost us the very thing Jesus Christ entrusted to us - the Good News that we are justified by grace alone and through faith alone. It is left to the reader to decide if the benefits outweigh the cost.<br /><br />Whether or not you are interested in reading Is the Reformation Over?, I would highly recommend reading R.C.

Perhaps \\"A Textbook in Eisogesis\\" or \\"Constructing Complex Theology From Non-Supporting Scriptures.\\" And really this book is an adventure in poor use of Scripture and unsupported statements.<br /><br />Let me say from the beginning that I believe silence is important. I believe solitude is important. Both are important parts of a healthy spiritual walk. I also believe in the importance of meditation, albiet meditation in a Puritan sense rather than an Eastern sense of the word. While these are good and necessary parts of a healthy spirituality, they are also dangerous if misused, and particularly dangerous if used in ways not only unsupported, but forbidden by Scripture.<br /><br />In Invitation to Solitude and Silence, Ruth Haley Barton seeks to lead the reader to prayer beyond words. \\"Much of our faith and practice is about words - preaching, teaching, talking with others. Yet all of these words are not enough to take us into the real presence of God where we can hear his voice. This book is an invitation to you to meet God deeply and fully outside the demands and noise of daily life\\" (from the back cover). This objection to vocalizing prayer is an undercurrent running throughout the book.<br /><br />The reader will doubtless not be surprised to learn that the primary Bible passage used to support Barton's theology of silent prayer is 1 Kings 19, where Elijah hears God's still small voice or a small sound or thin silence or a low whisper, depending on the translation. From this single passage, Barton draws out a complex theology of silent prayer wherein we will only fully experience God if we engage in this practice.<br /><br />According to Barton there are two primary reasons to enter into the silence. The first is to commune with God. She indicates that while words are useful, we sometimes use them too often and we can use them to express everything but matters of the heart. She encourages the reader to distinguish between heart and mind and to reduce the number of words in prayer while focusing instead on just being in prayer. The second reason to engage in silent prayer is to listen to God and receive guidance from Him.<br /><br />When discussing guidance Barton writes, \\"The fact that we can't see God makes it easy to slip into a pattern of doing all the talking ourselves. Is it too much to expect that God might speak back to us, not only with expressions of love but with guidance that is trustworthy and wise? Is it grandiose to believe God might actually interact with me in such a person and timely way? And if I do hear something, how do I know it is God's voice and not just my own thoughts masquerading as something more spiritual?\\" (page 118). The answer, of course, is that we do expect God to speak to us and to do so in a deeply personal way. Yet Scripture does not tell us that we should expect the type of personal revelation this book advocates. God speaks to use as the Holy Spirit applies Scripture to our hearts. This may be unsatisfying for people who desire to experience God in their way, in their time and on their terms, but this is what the Bible clearly teaches.<br /><br />There is great danger in allowing supposed personal communication from God to become normative. For example, Barton tells about God calling her to vocational, ordained ministry through her times of silence. Yet the Bible teaches with utmost clarity that women are never called to this type of ministry. She allows her personal experience to supercede the clear teaching of Scripture.<br /><br />While the book focuses primarily on a theology of silent prayer, each chapter concludes with a \\"Practice\\" section in which Barton practically applies what has been taught. Early in the book she suggests finding a sacred space and perhaps an icon or object to help focus on God. Here is an excerpt from a later chapter. \\"Take a few moments to allow your body to settle into a comfortable yet alert position. Take several deep breaths as a way of entering into the silence and making yourself present to the One who is always present with you...In your time of listening today, ask God to bring to your heart a moment in the last couple of days where you were most grateful...Is there any way God may be guiding you to choose more of what gives you life?\\"<br /><br />I was disappointed to see that Barton did not discuss the potential dangers of silent prayer. After all, this type of prayer is practiced in most of the world's religions. Many Christians believe, and with some justification I think, that entering the silence is the same for Christians as it is for Hindus or Muslims or adherents to any other system of religion. Surely it would be due diligence for Barton to warn that people may encounter forces other than God while in the silence.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that I do not recommend this book for any reason. The teaching Scripturally indefensible and potentially very dangerous. The author would have us believe that we can only truly commune with God and receive His clearest guidance if we engage in this practice. Yet she is unable to prove this with Scripture and so we must toss this teaching on the ever-growing heap of unbiblical nonsense masquerading as Christian theology.

Of course English literature began with a theological novel in the form of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. In more recent years we have seen a series by Richard Belcher that has been quite popular in Reformed circles and Brian McLaren's somewhat notorious series, popular in Emerging Church circles, that began with A New Kind of Christian. A recent addition to this list is Common Grounds written by Glenn Lucke and Ben Young.<br /><br />Ben Young is a Southern Baptist who is associate pastor of worship at the inconceivably huge Second Baptist Church in Houston, Texas. Glenn Lucke is a graduate of Reformed Theological Seminary and leads Docent Communications Group. Their relationship and a common concern about the lack of theological understanding in the young people they interacted with, led them to write a book presenting the basics of the faith. As they began to write the book evolved into its current narrative format.<br /><br />Common Grounds is the story of three friends who are all at different places in life. Brad is a nominally Baptist investment banker; Lauren is an unbelieving former Catholic corporate attorney; Jarrod is a Charismatic graduate student in philosophy. These three friends gather each Sunday evening to talk and share their lives with each other. One day Brad meets a new friend, a semi-retired professor of theology. He invites this man to join their group and the professor begins to mentor them in the faith, presenting to them the foundations of Christian doctrine. These weekly conversations address critical doctrines such as sin, evil, revelation (both natural and special), sovereignty, and more.<br /><br />This book is notable for at least two reasons. First, the doctrine presented is Scripturally-sound and consistent with Reformed theology. Second, the authors present a way of evangelizing people that is geared to a postmodern generation. They employ the twin concepts of narrative and story to present sound doctrine in a way that will appear to postmoderns more than the traditional abstract propositions one might find in a classic book like Evidence that Demands a Verdict. Today's generation is less-likely to be persuaded by a cold, rationalist presentation of the facts, and more likely to be persuaded by the presentation of a person's own testimony or story. Common Grounds will help believers understand how this can be effective.<br /><br />My only concern with the book was that there was no clear presentation of the gospel. This postmodern method of evangelism can be effective, but only if it includes the gospel! My concern was alleviated, though, when Glenn Lucke sent me the following in an email. \\"The 3 key missing words on the last page are 'To Be Continued.' Book 2 is largely done but needs revision as MacGregor continues to teach Brad and Jarrod more deeply about the Christian faith and to explain it to skeptic Lauren.\\" Common Grounds is only the first chapter of the story. I look forward to reading the continuation of this fascinating dialogue. I echo Al Mohler's endorsement where he writes, \\"If you want to reach the postmodern generation, read this book and give it to your friends.\\"t sound doctrine in a way that will appear to postmoderns more than the traditional abstract propositions one might find in a classic book like Evidence that Demands a Verdict.

There are several factors that have contributed to this, not the least of which is the success of the Harry Potter books and movies. Witchcraft is widely-regarded as \\"just another religion\\" - one that is not much different from any other. But what sets Wicca apart from the alternative systems of religion is the attraction it has to young people, and young girls in particular. Teens are turning to witchcraft in droves, proudly adopting a system of religion that they feel allows them great freedom.<br /><br />In What's the Deal with Wicca, Steve Russo, who cohosts Focus on the Family's weekly teen raidio show, Life on the Edge, and who speaks to thousands of teens around the country every year, offers an examination of the beliefs and practices of Wicca. He also presents a biblical perspective on this religion, and any other that rejects the truth of Scripture. While primarily targetted at teens, the book is written in such a way that it will appeal to readers of any age.<br /><br />On the whole Russo does a satisfactory job of explaining the draw and the dangers of Wicca. He devotes great detail to explaining the beliefs and tools of the craft. There is much to learn if we wish to understand what makes this religion such a popular alternative to Christianity, especially among teens who have been previously exposed to the Bible. Russo shows that at its heart Wicca is a selfish religion where a person can worship in whatever way makes him feel best. \\"When you step back and look at the big picture, you realize that the power Wicca offers is very self-centered, self-reliant and limited\\" (page 61). He goes on to provide pointers on how to tell if a person is involved in Wicca and suggests ways of respectfully challenging their beliefs.<br /><br />The downside to the book is that it really could have used some better editing. It is always a temptation for an author to cram as much detail as he can into a book, but in many cases it is best to focus only areas of particular importance. At times I felt that What's the Deal with Wicca became bogged down in detail and I found myself wondering if I was learning what was most important, or if I was learning minor, unimportant details. There were also times where the book seemed to lack direction and focus.<br /><br />Those small complaints aside, this is a valuable book and one that is an appropriate title to give to a teenager who may be seeking spiritual fulfillment outside of Scripture.cram as much detail as he can into a book, but in many cases it is best to focus only areas of particular importance.

Similarly, when a musician tries her hand at acting the results are usually painful. It seems the same is generally true when an author of novels tries his hand at non-fiction. So it was with some trepidation that I opened The Slumber of Christianity, a book written by Ted Dekker, an author known for his heart-pounding thrillers. This represents his first attempt at writing a non-fiction book. Thankfully, it turns out that he is a gifted writer who is able to express himself in either genre.<br /><br />\\"It seems that the lives of Christians are pretty much the same as the unchurched. We face the same challenges, the same heartaches. And, just like the rest of the world, most of aren't happy\\" (from the back cover). Frustrated with the lack of joy he sees in those who profess Christ, Dekker came to see that many believers have fallen asleep to some basic truths that could forever change their lives; they have lost their hope for heaven. They have lost their obsession for life after death.<br /><br />\\"We have here in this life many foretastes of the bliss that waits us, but unless we know what those foretastes are of, they will never satisfy us. Unless we become desperate for the bliss of the next life, we will never enjoy this life\\" (page 11). Many Christians have opted to live a life of worldly Christianity. \\"It's a form of godliness, stripped of the power of hope. In so many teachings and books designed to prod us into successful Christian living, there's a preoccupation with life on earth rather than the life to come\\" (page 75). Christians have opted to seek pleasure not in the promises of God for the world to come, but in the foretastes of glory God has provided to us now. No wonder, then, that so many Christians are dissatisfied! They continually wonder if this is all there is even when the Bible is filled with admonitions to look to the life to come. \\"The fact is, nothing in this life can satisfy unless it is fully bathed in an obsession for eternity. Nothing. Not a purpose-driven life, not a grand adventure, not the love of a dashing prince of the hand of a beautiful maiden...These all will fail our need for unencumbered happiness. We will always be torn and frustrated, no matter how much rejoicing we do this side of death, unless we awaken to a new passion for heaven on earth\\" (page 11-12).<br /><br />Having adequately and eloquently described the condition of the church, Dekker turns to a prescription of the cure. Unfortunately, this is where the book loses steam. He suggest three ways of reawakening the heart to heaven: meditation, reading and corporate exercises. Sadly, the mediation he suggests is not the type that was often practiced by the Puritans, who focused their thoughts and hearts on a particular subject, but the type taught by Richard Foster and Henri Nouwen. The sections on reading and corporate exercises were moderately better, but still quite unsatisfying, often backed by sloppy use of Scripture.<br /><br />So what are we to say about this book? It is an admirable attempt to bring sense to condition that is evident within the church. Why is it that so many Christians speak of a joy that they do not display in their lives? Why do we speak of faith, hope and love, yet show so little hope? Dekker provides much wisdom in explaining how this has happened and in explaining the danger of such a mindset. But when it comes to his solution, I was left unsatisfied, unconvicted by his use of Scripture. As half a book it is wonderful. As a whole book it is somewhat disappointing.fact is, nothing in this life can satisfy unless it is fully bathed in an obsession for eternity. Nothing.

Behind an inspiring song is an inspiring story. Behind the song \\"Mommy Paints the Sky,\\" there is both. With thanksgiving but sadness in his heart, Danny Oertli wrote a song for his daughter. \\"As the sun lays down to sleep / You ask me why she's gone / I don't know where to start / As the sunset lights your face / I see God knows how to heal little hearts.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gracie, Jack and I were driving down the road in my really fast Honda minivan. As we pulled into a parking space at Wal-Mart an incredible sunset began to form over the mountains. The car's interior was bathed in amber light and deep strokes of yellow criss-crossed the sky, as if drawn by an unseen hand.<br /><br />\\"'Daddy,' came Gracie's little voice from the back seat, 'Did God let mommy paint the sky tonight?'<br /><br />\\"Looking in the rearview mirror I saw her leaning into Jack to catch a better view. As the light from the sunset settled on their faces, I silently praised God for the healing and hope He had brought into our lives.<br /><br />\\"For months I had been assuring Gracie and Jack that God had not forgotten us and that He loved us more than we could imagine. I had used big words like \\"sovereign\\" and \\"eternity,\\" concepts even I didn't understand.\\"<br /><br />But somehow, on that night, God gave Gracie a glimpse of something that touched her little heart. He began to heal her. On a warm, November night, God used the magnificence of His creation to teach a lonely little girl a lesson her father could not - that mommy had gone to be with Jesus. God began to heal a little heart that was hurting for its mommy.<br /><br />Mommy Paints the Sky is a love story: a story written by Danny Oertli, a singer, songwriter and now an author, to share the story of his life with Cyndi. He fell in love with Cyndi in high school, dated her through college and married her shortly after. But within six months of marriage they were devastated to learn that she had cancer. God saw fit to heal her and in the years that followed to bring two children to their family. But after eight years marked with both struggle and triumph, God very suddenly called Cyndi to Himself, leaving a man struggling to find hope and meaning through the pain and leaving two children wondering when mommy would come home.<br /><br />This is a beautiful story and one that touched me deeply, perhaps because I have been married for a similar amount of time and have a similar family, or perhaps because the lessons Oertli learned were ones I need to learn as well. As we read about Cyndi's illness and her death, we can see Danny's growth in his understanding of those terms he claims to know so little about - sovereignty and eternity. He comes to see that God is sovereign and can do His will within His creation. He comes to see that suffering is not meaningless, but that somehow it serves a purpose. Oertli writes, in his reflection on a special passage of Scripture, that \\"God was teaching me to take my eyes off myself and focus on others. It would be a hard-fought battle, as everything in me wanted to pull back from people and wallow in suffering\\" (page 133). At the same time he learned about eternity, that it is only one short sleep past (to borrow a phrase from John Donne). God exists outside of time, so while His timing may not be ours, we have to trust that He knows best.<br /><br />Oertli expresses his understanding of these great truths in \\"Worship You With Tears,\\" the first song he wrote after Cyndi's death. \\"You know when I rise / You know when I sleep / You know I need you desperately / I pour out my soul, oh Lord / I worship you with tears / I am broken / I have nothing to give / I fall at your feet / And worship you with tears.\\" He shows that he can worship God with tears, trusting not in knowing why God allowed this to happen, but in God's goodness, faithfulness and sovereignty. That spirit of trust pervades the book.<br /><br />I'll admit that Ihad a few small concerns with the author's theology, primarily with several uses of the \\"God spoke to me\\" language that is all too common today. Some may say that I've allowed emotion to distract me from this seriousness of this problem (and this is an emotional book), but I feel that it did not detract seriously from the book, and to focus undue attention on it would be to miss the beauty of the story. While God may not have spoken to Gracie through the sunset, He somehow used it to touch her heart and to help her understand that mommy had gone to be with Him. I cannot argue with that.<br /><br />This book encouraged me, even as one who has never experienced so painful and significant a loss. I have little doubt it will be used to touch and to heal many hurting hearts and to prepare others for the pain that is always so nearby in this fallen world. To echo the words of Jerry Bridges in his endorsement, \\"Mommy Paints the Sky will draw you closer to God.\\" It will also move you to tears. A beautiful story, this is one I highly recommend. I would also recommend purchasing Danny Oertli's album Everything Inbetween as a companion, as it has recordings of many of the songs he writes about in this book. The book grows better when you can hear the songs, and the songs have more meaning once you have read the story.I'll admit that I had a few small concerns with the author's theology, primarily with several uses of the \\"God spoke to me\\" language that is all too common today.

Mahaney now stops to reflect on Christ's sacrifice. Christ Our Mediator follows hard on the heels of many similar books timed to coincide with the popularity of The Passion of the Christ. Mahaney begins the book by asserting (correctly, it seems) that a visual presentation of Christ's crucifixion simply is not enough - we must also be told about the content of the story of the gospel. \\"The gospel message isn't visual; it's truth. It is truth to be believed, not simply a collection of images to be viewed\\" (page 10). Knowing that many people have seen the how of Christ's death, Mahaney sets out to bring sense to the why of it.<br /><br />To explain the cross, Mahaney presents a handful of reflections or meditations on Christ's suffering and death. Drawing on Scripture and the teachings of great Christians of our day and days past, he presents the gospel in all its force and power. He presents the message that people hate to hear, yet so badly need to hear. This message is the only thing that can save the soul, and Mahaney presents it with that sort of urgency.<br /><br />This little book, weighing in at only 95 pages, will stir your heart with renewed love for Christ. We could wish that it was a little bit longer, but clearly it was meant only as an introduction to this important topic. Mahaney is sure to recommend, as further reading, other excellent books dealing with the subject. He recommends The Gospel for Real Life and The Discipline of Grace by Jerry Bridges, The Cross of Christ by John Stott, Saved From What? by R.C. Sproul, The Passion of Jesus Christ by John Piper and The Message of Salvation by Philip Ryken. To that list I would add The Cross He Bore by Frederick Leahy, a wonderful book of meditations upon the cross.<br /><br />Another challenging little book by C.J. Mahaney, Christ Our Mediator is a welcome sequel to The Cross Centered Life and one I heartily recommend. It provides a great introduction to the importance of the cross and will lead the reader not only to understand why Christ had to die, but to want to know more.welcome sequel to The Cross Centered Life and one I heartily recommend.

Mahaney at His Best	I felt a deep sense of deja vu as I read Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God. It took me only a few pages to realize that this book, in a condensed form, forms the basis for a chapter in Sex and the Supremacy of Christ (edited by John Piper and Justin Taylor). I had enjoyed that particular chapter of Sex and the Supremacy of Christ and felt certain I would likewise enjoy this lengthened version.<br /><br />Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God is based loosely on the Song of Solomon. C.J. Mahaney shares my understanding of this book of the Bible stating simply, \\"It's about sex\\" (page 9). While many have attempted to allegorize Solomon's song, few have succeeded with any degree of credibility. \\"That's right gentlemen.\\" says Mahaney, \\"Solomon's Song of Songs is an entire book of the Bible devoted to the promotion of sexual intimacy within the covenant of marriage. It's an eight-chapter feast of unbridled, uninhibited, joyous immersion in verbal and physical expressions of passion between a man and a woman\\" (page 10). Amen. So as the reader prepares to read this book, he must prepare to celebrate God's gift of sex. The author says, \\"The purpose of the book you hold in your hands is to lead us back into God's ideal of joyful, unashamed, indulgent, loving sexuality in the context of marriage\\" (pages 14-15). This book is directed primarily to men, largely because it is the husband's role (not an author's) to lead his wife into a fuller understanding of what Scripture teaches about sexuality. Mahaney will provide the foundation men can build upon to discover with his wife how sex and romance can be done to the glory of God.<br /><br />Following an introductory chapter Mahaney uncovers the divine purpose for marriage. This, he teaches, is to reflect the relationship between Christ and the Church. He goes on in the next chapter to provide a piece of wisdom he considers the most important in the entire book: \\"In order for romance to deepen, you must touch the heart and mind of your wife before you touch her body\\" (page 28).<br /><br />Several chapters follow in which Mahaney offers specific ways of touching a wife's heart and mind in order to build the type of relationship God desires for a marriage. Turning to the actual act of consumation, he follows Solomon's lead, providing little in the way of specific details that might read like a to-do list. Instead he invites us to study and understand the Song of Solomon to understand what Solomon meant when he wrote, \\"Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden, let its spices flow. Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits\\" (4:16).<br /><br />The book concludes with a chapter written by Carolyn Mahaney (C.J.'s wife) addressed to women. It is the fifth chapter (\\"The Pleasure of Purity\\") of her book Feminine Appeal: Seven Virtues of a Godly Wife and Mother.<br /><br />With lots of humor (much of it self-deprecating), but also compassion and sensitivity, Mahaney sets forth some principles that will bear much fruit in many marriages. He is honest about his book. \\"Please don't make the mistake of thinking that simply by reading this book you are being changed. I wish it were that easy. But change does not take place until we apply what we are learning in very specific ways, at very specific times, and always in dependence on God's grace to make our efforst effective\\" (page 35). This book is just the beginning. Far from a \\"10 Surefire Ways to Make Your Woman Melt\\" kind of book, Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God will lead the husband to see his wife as a remarkable God-given treasure. It will help the husband learn to see his wife in color while everyone else appears in mere black and white.<br /><br />While it may seem strange, this book refreshed my joy in being a Christian. I was amazed at the wisdom of God who saw fit to give us an entire book of the Bible dedicated to teaching us how to love our spouses in a way that honors Him. Truly His Word is sufficient! Truly it is relevant! I was thankful that He has provided teachers to explain the Word to us. And I was renewed in my gratefulness towards Him for providing me the priceless treasure that is my wife.<br /><br />So men, buy this book. I cannot imagine a husband who would gain nothing from it. Women, buy a copy and slip it into your husband's hand with a suggestive wink. He'll get the idea. Read it, enjoy it, and most of all, put it into practice.

It is one man's story of a friend God used to guide him to the Lord. As such it is a story not unlike many every Christian has heard. Yet I never grow tired of hearing how God brings His people to Himself, and the circumstances he saves them from.<br /><br />1984 was a big year for James O'Donnell. It is the year his father died; the year his salary was cut despite great success in his field; the year he decided to divorce his wife; and the year he met Arthur. Arthur, who was older and had been a Christian for a long time, listened to, guided and helped his new friend. He showed him a glimpse of the power of God working in the heart of one of His people. 1984 went from a year of great darkness to a year of the brightest light.<br /><br />Having told the story of his conversion, the author turns the book over to his friend. It concludes with an epilogue written by Arthur, humbled at having been used in such a way. \\"To me, the substance of what Jim recalls sounds more like the work of the Holy Spirit, introducing a prism into Jim's perceptions of me and what I did. Jim saw and heard what he needed to in order to bring him closer to God\\" (page 148). And isn't that just how the Holy Spirit works. Arthur concludes the book by writing, \\"I am astonished and fortunate to have been so used. But the truth is that if I had been given Jim's teaching and writing skills, I would be writing a book called Walking With Jim\\" (page 150).<br /><br />The book is well-written (despite the use of a few too many colloquialisms) and on the whole the theology is sound. While a valuable book, and one I can recommend (even if not too enthusiastically), I would not consider it a must-read. Still, it has a certain charm and I did enjoy it.	2005-08-23

Most people also know about the stand he made for his beliefs as he refused to run an Olympic race he was favored to win simply because the race was scheduled for Sunday. Those who have seen the movie know that it ends shortly after he wins an Olympic gold medal in an event in which he had barely trained. But in Pure Gold, a biography of Liddell weighing in at 333 pages, the race is complete by the ninety-eighth page. There is much more to Liddell than the movie portrays.<br /><br />Eric Liddell is a man who was sold out to God. He regarded his own desires and his own comforts as secondary to God's. Raised as the son of a missionary, he grew up away from his parents, for in those days children were left in their native country to receive their training, often seeing their parents only once every six or seven years. There was a period of over a decade in Liddell's life where he was with his parents for only 100 days. Despite the seperation, he received strong training, primarily in the Bible.<br /><br />While he grew both academically and spiritually, people also came to realize that Liddell had a gift for speed. He was fast. He was also uncouth, with a running style all his own. He would start like any other runner, but as he approached the finish line, he would throw his head back and his arms would begin to flail. Yet somehow, rather than slow him down, this gave him a burst of speed that often led him to victory.<br /><br />Some of his exploits from his early days are famous, such as the time he fell in a 400-meter race, but managed to climb to his feet and work his way back into first place, making up a deficit of over ten meters. And as we know from the movie, he earned a position on the British Olympic squad at the 1924 Olympic Games where he came away with two medals, a gold and a bronze. He returned to his native Scotland a hero - far and away the best-known athlete in the nation. It was this fame that provided the springboard for his mission work. Despite being a shy and quiet man, he criss-crossed the country, speaking before hundreds of thousands of people, telling them about the Lord and encouraging them to give their lives to Him.<br /><br />At the very pinnacle of his athletic success, Liddell laid it all aside to become a missionary to China, the country his father had served when Eric was a boy and the country he continued to serve to that day. Liddell counted his prestige as nothing and moved to the mission field. He served the rest of his life in China before his eventual death in a Japanese internment camp during the Second World War. It is this period of his life that so few know about, yet this is where we see Liddell at his finest. It is here that we see the power and effectiveness of a life that is sold out to God.<br /><br />This biography is well-written, inspiring and highly-recommended. It presents Liddell as he really was and helps the reader understand the foundation for his life. It portrays Liddell in his strength and in his weakness, through joy and sadness. It portrays the consistency of a man who lived in the same way when the eyes of the nation were upon him, or when he stood only before the eyes of the Lord.<br /><br />While Chariots of Fire has done much to bring Liddell to the public eye, and while it presented the man accurately, it tells less than half the story. However, the race which forms the climax to the movie can well be seen as a metaphor for Liddell's life. He finished the race of life the same way he had finished so many races long before - with his arms flailing and his head turned to the sky, enraptured purely with the joy of running.the nation.

However, the race which forms the climax to the movie can well be seen as a metaphor for Liddell's life. He finished the race of life the same way he had finished so many races long before - with his arms flailing and his head turned to the sky, enraptured purely with the joy of running.	2005-08-23

The first, provacatively titled The Missionary Position examines Mother Teresa's faith and practice. Written by Christopher Hitchens, the book received a fair amount of recognition and formed the basis for a television documentary. The book is quite short and contains very little in the way of footnotes and documentation.<br /><br />The other critical biography is entitled Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict and is written by Aroup Chatterjee. This title is several hundred pages longer than Hitchens' book and contains extensive documentation. Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict claims to reveal \\"the REAL Teresa (from the back cover).\\" Like Hitchens, Chatterjee is an atheist and his dislike of Mother Teresa has little to do with a religious bias. Like Hitchens, he has found that the reality of the woman and her work is a far cry from the legend. However, unlike Hitchens, he is a native of Calcutta, the city where Mother Teresa did her work, and the very city which will forever be linked to her.<br /><br />Before I summarize the book, allow me to make one general statement. The book is long - probably too long. As I have already mentioned, Chatterjee provides extensive documentation and often provides multitudes of examples where only two or three may have sufficed. He sometimes repeats information in subsequent chapters, using the same information to prove two points. This, of course, is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does call into question the book's organization. In short, the book has some of the problems typical of those that have not been professionally edited. Due to the nature of the book's subject matter, professional publishing was not a possibility, so Chatterjee had to make do largely on his own.<br /><br />A terse summary of Chatterjee's primary concerns with Mother Teresa appear in the final chapter where he quotes his \\"Deposition Before the Committee for Beatification/Canonisation of Mother Teresa.\\" Among Chatterjee's concerns are:<br /><br />  * Mother Teresa often said that she picked people up from the streets of Calcutta, but she and her order of nuns did not do this. People requesting such service were told curtly to ring 102 (similar to 911).<br /><br />  * While the order owns several ambulances, these are used primarily to transport nuns to and from places of prayer.<br /><br />  * Mother Teresa said that her order fed 4000, 5000, 7000 or 9000 Caltuttans every day (the number varied). The two or three soup kitchens in Calcutta feed a maximum of only 300 people per day. The kitchens will provide food only to people with \\"food cards\\" that are distrubuted predominantly to the Catholic poor.<br /><br />  * While Mother Teresa's order has some presence in many countries throughout the world, the majority of these are for training monks or nuns, not for aiding the poor.<br /><br />  * Mother Teresa's shelters will usually only help children if the parents sign a form of renunciation which signs the rights to the children to her organization.<br /><br />  * Mother Teresa often insists that her natural family clinics prevent unwanted pregnancies, but this number is without any basis in truth.<br /><br />  * Mother Teresa insisted that suffering was beautiful as it evoked Christ's suffering, but when ill she visited exclusive, expensive hospitals.<br /><br />  * The hospice in Calcutta through which Mother Teresa gained such wide recognition is very small (80 beds) and provides little medical care. Needles are reused, all patients are forced to have their heads shaven, visitors are forbidden and painkillers are rarely if ever used. The nurses do not speak the language of the people and are not usually involved in the care of the patients. This duty is assumed by volunteers.<br /><br />  * Mother Teresa often accepted money from suspicious sources, the most notable of which is Charles Keating, America's most notorious thief.<br /><br />Through his research and involvment in the deposition, Chatterjee came to the realization that canonization is not bestowed on the basis of morality, but on the basis of strict and committed adherence to the tenets of Catholicism. As an atheist, this was exasperating to him.<br /><br />Chatterjee quotes Mother Teresa as saying, \\"We are not nurses, we are not doctors, we are not teachers, we are not social workers. We are religious, we are religious, we are religious.\\" Yet Mother Teresa is known as a humanitarian and one who gave her life to the poor. The reality seems far different.<br /><br />What do we learn from a book like this? We learn that as Christians we must have a consistent witness in our words and our deeds. We also learn the importance of choosing our heroes with the utmost of care. And we learn that many heroes are manufactured - that the legend far exceeds the reality.merica's most notorious thief.<br /><br />Through his research and involvment in the deposition, Chatterjee came to the realization that canonization is not bestowed on the basis of morality, but on the basis of strict and committed adherence to the tenets of Catholicism.

As Christians we have strong opinions on each of these issues, believing them to be in direct contradiction with the will of God. So how do we go about discussing such difficult topics in our pluralistic society. The truth is that we often shy away from such discussions rather than risk offending others or appearing intolerant. Yet as Christians it is our responsibility to share what we know to be true. &lt;em>Talking About Good and Bad Without Getting Ugly&lt;/em>, written by Paul Chamberlain, director of the Institute of Christian Apologetics and professor at Trinity Western University, offers a solution to this dilemma.<br /><br />Chamberlain believes that meaningful dialogue on the difficult moral questions is not only a &lt;em>possibility&lt;/em> but is a &lt;em>responsibility&lt;/em>. It is crucial that Christians engage the culture with this issues for two reasons. First, this allows us to hone our own positions on these issues. It is easy to think we have all the answers, but a good challenge can benefit us by forcing us to think through the deep and difficult issues. Second, this can be our way of contributing to our culture as it struggles with new questions of morality. \\"My hope is that this book will be something of a map, or should I say an atlas, to help us talk about good and bad without getting ugly; a guide for engaging issues that so often leave us confused and exasperated\\" (page 13).<br /><br />Through fictional dialogue, clear examples and strong teaching, Chamberlain leads us toward that goal. He shows how the spirit of relativism that pervades our age has undermined the very moral foundations our nations were built upon. \\"The wide acceptance of this moral perspective has not only left us with few firm moral principles to guide us through the tough moral questions we face, but it has also produced a generation of people who not only have trouble distinguishing right from wrong but who actually question whether such standards exist at all\\" (page 28). In short, we have been thrown back to a type of moral stone age.<br /><br />Chamberlain covers difficult topics such as the nature of truth, tolerance and truth in an age of pluralism, subjective versus objective standards of morality, the foundational truths of relativism and the battle for change. In the final chapter the author holds up William Wilberforce, a crucial role in the abolition of slavery in Britain, as an example of a man who had a profound influence upon his country simply by standing for an absolute standard of morality. He shows how Wilberforce achieved his goal and the moral foundation that kept him strong.<br /><br />On the whole this was an excellent book and one I can highly recommend. Chamberlain is clearly a gifted teacher and he does justice to his topic. He provides the framework to an apologetic that any Christian can follow to understand the issues and provide a defense. He does so in a short format (126 pages), and with grace and clarity. He uncovers the tough issues and shows how we can discuss them without \\"getting ugly.\\"e trouble distinguishing right from wrong but who actually question whether such standards exist at all\\" (page 28).

'Shall I say this psalm?' she faltered. Overcome with emotion, the priest who had tried so hard to save Jane from this moment, could scarcely reply. After a moment's pause, he simply said, 'Yea.' Jane then began to repeat Psalm 51 in English, David's great prayer of contrition...A deep silence rested over the sad scene, nothing could be heard except for the quiet sobbing of her lady attendants. Hardened soliders who had witnessed brutality many times before stood without moving...Bracing her body to receive the impact of the blow, Lady Jane called out in a clear voice, 'Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit.' With a stroke, swift, sharp and terrible, Jane's short life was ended\\" (page 200-201).<br /><br />So ended the life of a bright light in a particularly dark and strange period of English history. In a time when the Catholic powers were trying to exterminate the new Reformed teaching, the two potential rulers who seemed most likely to increase the Protestant faith both came to an early end. Edward VI, only a teenager, died following a long bout with tuberculosis. Edward was a strong Christian and committed to the expansion of Reformed Protestantism. He attempted to bypass his half-sister Mary, an ardent Catholic, who was next in line to the throne and hand it instead to Lady Jane Grey, a friend and sister in Christ who was committed to Protestantism. Lady Jane, under great pressure from her family agreed, but did so only with the greatest reluctance. The attempt quickly failed and Mary came to the throne, bringing with her a time of terrible persecution against Protestants. Lady Jane was one of those who died during this time of great conflict. Why God chose to allow this to happen - why he would allow two strong Christians to perish in order to usher in a reign of terror and persecution - is beyond our reckoning.  Truly His ways are not our ways.<br /><br />&lt;em>Lady Jane Grey&lt;/em> by Faith Cook, is the story of Lady Jane, who is known as the nine day queen of England. The author seeks to portray Lady Jane as someone who was more than a mere pawn in the hands of powerful men, but was a young lady of starting intelligence and strong faith. Cook feels that Lady Jane's treatment in history has been unfair, and has assigned to her far too little credit. To understand her, we must first understand that dark period of British history, and the author provides the information necessary to properly see the tragedy unfold. The strength of this young woman's faith is incredible, that one so young could know so much.<br /><br />Even when offered a chance to save her life, she refused to accept Catholic teachings. Even when befriending a priest, the only person allowed to provide religious counsel during her final days, she did not hesitate to challenge him on his erroneous beliefs. Even when she had been thrust into a position which was not rightly hers, she accepted full responsibility for her sinful actions.<br /><br />Because this story cannot be separated from the period of history in which it happened, the author has to spend a fair amount of time teaching history. She does so with clarity and precision, never allowing the narrative to become broken. She successfully combines history with biography in telling the story of an admirable Christian woman. Cook aptly summarizes the importance of Lady Jane's death. \\"Like the apostle Paul, she had fought a good fight, finished the course and kept her faith. Henceforth there was laid up for her a crown of righteousness - a crown none could take from her\\" (page 201). Lady Jane stands as an inspiration for her strong stand for what she knew to be right. This book is informative, moving and most importantly, inspiring. I thoroughly enjoyed this biography and am more than happy to recommend it.Jane Grey&lt;/em> by Faith Cook, is the story of Lady Jane, who is known as the nine day queen of England.

US	43519458	RU6SM53AI7M6I	0764229958	868628214	Levi's Will	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Another Great Drama from Cramer	In 1943, Levi Mullet escapes his farm, his father, and his Amish heritage. He leaves behind family, scandal and beliefs in order to set out on his own. Defying his pacifist upbringing he enlists and fights in the Second World War. After the war he marries and settles down with his family. But even when living in the Deep South, far from Ohio, he cannot shake the memories of his family. He cannot fully and finally uproot himself. His prodigal heart beats for home.<br /><br />In Levi's Will Dale Cramer, whose previous books, also published by Bethany House are Sutter's Cross and Bad Ground, brings us a story of betrayal, judgmentalism and forgiveness. He brings us a story of \\"the sins of the fathers.\\" Ultimately he brings us a story about grace. With settings as diverse the Amish countryside of Northern Ohio, the battlefields of Europe and the burning heat of Georgia, Cramer's attention to detail and realism paints a story that is both moving and profound.<br /><br />Cramer's novels remind me of those written by Jeffrey Archer - he can draw the reader into his world without relying on cheap tricks. He can carry a book for 400 pages without filling it with action that would take more from the plot than it would add to it. For example, when he sends Will to war, he sends him as a mechanic and not as a soldier. He does not add electrifying plot twists in an attempt to keep the reader intrigued. And indeed, he does not need to. This is a book relying more on the strength of the characters than on their actions. And in my view it is the mark of a superior novelist that he can create characters strong enough that they carry the book of their own accord.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book from cover-to-cover. It moves slowly compared to the thrillers I most-often seem to review, but I definitely enjoyed it more. It seems to me that Christian fiction has come a long way since I last invested time in it. Levi's Will is a long way from This Present Darkness. And it's a good thing.hing.	2005-08-02

For one can only be planted so firmly on a system that has no foundation. Relativism, written by Greg Koukl and Francis Beckwith, critiques moral relativism and explores the myriad inconsistencies inherent in this position.<br /><br />The authors launch a five-pronged attack on relativism. In the first part they help the reader understand relativism and see the three different types: \\"society says,\\" \\"society does\\" and \\"I say\\" relativism. In the second part they critique relativism, exposing seven of its most fatal flaws before turning in the third part to an exposure of the impact of relativism on education. In the fourth part they examine relativism in public policy, and specifically its application to homosexual marriage, abortion and euthenasia - three of the pressing issues of our time. The final part provides some tools to refute relativism.<br /><br />The final part was the one I found most helpful. Having explained the background and dangers of relativism, the authors suggest some tactics that are helpful in arguing against relativism. First, they suggest showing the contradictions inherent in relativism, for in practice, this position is self-refuting. One effective tactic, then, is to show people that many of their positions depend on some type of absolute stance. They suggest the best way of dealing with the charge of \\"don't force your morality on me,\\" is to simply ask \\"why not?\\" What gives him the right to impose his morality on you when you are not able to do the same to him? Second, they suggest pressing the person's hot button. Find that person's pet issue and relativize it to undermine his position. Third, force the tolerance issue. Force the person to examine why he cannot tolerate what he perceives as your intolerance. And fourth, have a ready defense. Know the issues and know the best ways to defend your position while casting doubts on the relativist's position.<br /><br />While a book on this topic could easily become deeply philosophical and difficult to understand, Beckwith and Koukl do a good job of making it accessible. There are a few parts I had to read a few times to thoroughly understand them, but on the whole they write in such a way that they make their points clear without requiring extensive background in philosophy. Several points could have received more attention, but I understand the need to keep the book short enough to be attractive to a wide array of readers. In fact, my only real complaint with the book would be their use of the tiresome cliche of Adolf Hitler representing all that is evil in humans and Mother Teresa representing all that is good. The authors might plead that they use Mother Teresa only because people immediately understand what she represents, but I think it is time we stop using such a poor example of all that is virtuous. Koukl and Beckwith know better.<br /><br />Relativism is a solid introduction to a topic with which we are all far too familiar simply because it pervades our society. Yet few positions do more to undermine the truth, the \\"true truth,\\" of Scripture. It is critical that we have a ready defense of the absolutes that underly the truth of Christianity. This is not the type of book that is likely to change the minds of those who are already firmly-entrenched in their position, but neither is that the book's primary purpose.

Four years of college, four years of being away from the presence of parents and church, leads many to abandon the faith they once professed. To combat this ongoing problem, David Wheaton, radio host and one-time tennis professional, has written University of Destruction. This book is targetted squarely at the teenager who is about to depart the comfort and safety of home to set out on his own, beginning with a college education.<br /><br />To explain how so many young people can fall away during their tenure at college Wheaton differentiates between professors and possessors. Everyone who claims to be a Christian when he begins college is a professor, for he professes faith in Christ. But only a few are possessors, those who actually possess a living and active faith. Clearly it is only those who possess the indwelling Holy Spirit, and are thus possessed by God, who can expect to remain strong through their years of higher education.<br /><br />Wheaton goes on to introduce what he calls the Pillars of Peril that every student will encounter. They are sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Sex refers to all forms of sexual deviance and activity outside of God's divinely ordained plan that sex be restricted to the marriage bed. The author emphasizes abstinence and allows no leeway for any type of sexual activity outside marriage. He also warns of the dangers involved in dating. While he does not directly advocate a courtship model, he does encourage young couples to date under the authority of their parents and to only date people with whom they can foresee a marriage.<br /><br />Drugs refers not only to the recreational drugs that are all too common at colleges, but also to alcohol. Wheaton encourages students to avoid alcohol altogether, not only because most college students are underage and drinking is thus an offense against the governmental authorities, but because it may represent a poor example to unbelievers. He suggests that students \\"Commit to a higher standard - don't drink alcohol...period! Take it out of play; remove it completely from your life...I can think of no positive reasons for drinking alcoholic beverages\\" (pages 74,75).<br /><br />The third Pillar of Peril is rock 'n' roll, by which the author refers not to music, but to what rock music exemplifies - rebellion against authority.<br /><br />Having introduced the pillars of peril, Wheaton goes on to help the student put together a game plan for addressing and overcoming each one of them. He concludes with helpful teaching about the importance of choosing friends wisely and choosing the right college.<br /><br />Throughout the book Wheaton continually refers the student to the Bible, affirming the power and supremacy of the Scriptures. His teaching is consistent with historical Protestantism and will surely reap great benefits in the lives of those who read and heed his teachings. He is deliberate in showing that the greatest sin on campus is not the acts themselves, but the erosion of Christian worldview, without which there is no authority, no right or wrong.<br /><br />This is a book I would not hesitate to provide as a gift for any student who is planning on attending college.

Some have been good, some have been awful. But I guess that is to be expected when the authors represented range from C.J. Mahaney to Pat Robertson; from John Piper to Bill Gothard. Of the titles I have read, none has been better than The Cross Centered Life.<br /><br />In his book The Discipline of Grace Jerry Bridges wrote, \\"The gospel is not only the most important message in all of history; it is the only essential message in all of history. Yet we allow thousands of professing Christians to live their entire lives without clearly understanding it and experiencing the joy of living by it\\" (The Discipline of Grace, page 46). C.J. Mahaney would have us remember that sometimes the most obvious truths are the very ones we need to be reminded of the most. The Cross Centered Life is just such a reminder.<br /><br />This is a small book, weighing in at a mere 89 pages. But its small stature is no indication of the weighty content inside. Throughout the book Mahaney calls the Christian to look only and always at the cross, and to find there the power to live a life that is pleasing to God. He reminds us of the great truths of the Christian faith: the truths of the objective nature of justification and the ongoing responsibility for our sanctification. He provides practical guidance on living each day so that it is centered on the cross. He tells us to memorize the gospel, to pray it, sing it, to review its power in our lives and to study it, that our understanding may foster greater passion for it.<br /><br />Mahaney's love for the cross shines through on each page. His passion is contagious, leading the reader to rejoice in the completed work of the Savior and to depend on His power in every area of life. \\"Name the area of the Christian life that you want to learn about or that you want to grow in. The Old Testament? The end times? Do you want to grow in holiness or the practice of prayer? To become a better husband, wife, or parent? None of these can be rightly understood apart from God's grace through Jesus' death. They, and indeed all topics, should be studied through the lens of the gospel\\" (page 76).<br /><br />A book that seems poised, and rightly so, to become a defining point in Mahaney's ministry, The Cross Centered Life is a wonderful, challenging little book that I am glad to recommend. It will do exactly what Mahaney wanted it to do: help you keep the gospel the main thing.ice of prayer? To become a better husband, wife, or parent?

I consider them to be among the most helpful of resources in helping equip Christians in their lifelong quest for Christ-likeness. We can learn much from the examples of those who have run the race before us. We can learn from what God taught them, learn from their triumphs and learn from the times they were defeated. I have a passion for biographies. I also have a passion for the English language. I love to see how we can use the language to craft works of art. I cannot express myself in the fine arts - music and art are both disciplines that escape me. But I consider myself a wordsmith-in-training. These two loves come together in Jack, a biography of C.S. Lewis written by a veritable master of the English language.<br /><br />George Sayer had what was probably a unique privilege - he met C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien at the same time. He studied English under the tutelage of both of these men while at Oxford University. He became friends with Lewis, growing closer as they grew older. As a friend he provides a unique perspective on what is surely a unique individual.<br /><br />I have never had the interest in and respect for C.S. Lewis that so many Christians afford him. Perhaps it is that I tend to see in black and white. Lewis exemplified some of the best and yet some of the worst in his understanding of Christianity. It seems that for every major doctrine he so brilliantly defended, there was another that he denied. For every brilliant insight there is a terrible oversight.<br /><br />Jack provides a glimpse into Lewis' life. This, combined with penetrating analysis from one who knew him well, makes this biography not only fascinating, but very credible. Sayer covers all of the foundational parts of Lewis' life - the death of his mother, his education, his infatuation with Mrs. Moore and his conversion to Christianity. The author looks also at most of Lewis' major writings. Having spent so much time with his subject, Sayer is even able to describe an average day in the life of C.S. Lewis - just the type of detail that is interesting, but is absent from most biographies.<br /><br />The detail, while interesting and often even necessary, is sometimes almost uncomfortable. Sayers goes so far as to detail Lewis' personal struggles with masturbation and fantasy as a youth, and his later fascination with his wife's body. Yet he does this not merely for the sake of being explicit, but always to help us better understand Lewis. He seeks to help the reader understand Lewis not just as an author, but as a person. He wants to show Lewis in the good times as well as the bad. He seeks to show Lewis as he really was.<br /><br />Thoroughly-researched and exquisitely-written, this is a brilliant biography of a figure whose importance to Christianity seems to be growing, even forty years after his death. With a major movie series coming to theatres beginning this year, we will surely hear a lot more about Lewis than ever before. While many biographies have been written about him, I would have trouble believing any could be better than this. No matter your opinion of the man himself, Jack, as a book, is a gem; a jewel; an absolute triumph.subject, Sayer is even able to describe an average day in the life of C.S.

Books	3	2	4	N	N	A Noble Attempt	Hook Line and Sinker is a book based on what the author, Michael Bresciani, calls \\"refutation preaching.\\" \\"Refutation preaching as its name implies serves to refute some doctrine or teaching that has previously been established and generally accepted. Often these previously established teachings have been based on the scriptures themselves. Still other teachings have gained acceptance through oral communication\\" (page 9). Refutation preaching, says the author, is as old as the Bible's record of human history. The prophets of the Old Testament were called to refute what had become accepted theology, but went against God's Word. In this book, Bresciani seeks to refute some of the cliches and theology that have become accepted within the church. He does so with mixed results.<br /><br />Some of what the author refutes is far overdue. God is testing you. I claimed a verse of Scripture. God told me to tell you. These are all phrases we hear used in a way that is foreign to any Scriptural understanding of God's work in our lives.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had many areas of concern with the author's theology. He seems to be an eclectic mixture of Conservative Protestant and Charismatic theology. Obviously he does not believe, as I do, in cessationism. He believes that God may give me a message of prophecy for someone else or that I should seek the gift of tongues. The theological inconsistency left me bewildered at times.<br /><br />The book also seemed to suffer from the spelling and grammatical issues that plague books that are self-published. It was far better than others I have read, but did not rise to the standards of books that have been professionally published.<br /><br />In the end, I appreciated what the author attempted to do, but felt that the shortcomings outweighed the strengths. His theology and mine are too often too far apart to allow me to agree with him as much as I would have liked.	2005-08-02

His mother, who died of cancer, left him the only thing she could give - a letter. She tells him to find his uncle Aiden. \\"When you find him, stay with him. He'll try to run you off, but don't let him. Do whatever it takes to stay with him. You have something I couldn't give him, and he something I couldn't give you. I won't tell you what - you'll just have to find out from each other. When you find it, you'll know.\\"<br /><br />Jeremy, a sheltered and timid teen, heads into the world to find this mysterious uncle. He finds him at a mining site where his uncle leads a crew of miners deep in the earth, digging tunnels with a massive mining machine. His uncle turns out to be a terribly scarred, bitter man who is as afraid of the light as his nephew is of the dark. Despite his uncle's best attempts to cast him off, Jeremy stubbornly perseveres, heeding his mother's words that he must not give up. Jeremy comes of age, deep within these same tunnels.<br /><br />As in his other novels, Cramer crafts strong, believable characters that the reader cannot help but care for. Bad Ground is certainly not a thriller, but relies instead on rich symbolism, powerful character development and the promise of redemption that seems always to lurk just beyond reach.<br /><br />Another powerful and stirring novel, Bad Ground reaches an emotional, satisfying conclusion. Cramer is fast becoming one of my favorite novelists. I highly recommend his books.	2005-08-02
US	43519458	R148L63IVPZPLZ	0801065593	48357878	What is Reformed Theology?: Understanding the Basics	Books	5	96	99	N	N	Sproul at His Finest	Most Christians have heard of Reformed theology. Most think they have a good handle on it. But experience has shown me that few really know it as well as they think they do. And that goes for people who claim to be Reformed as much as those who do not. This cannot be said of R.C. Sproul. Not only does Sproul have an amazingly broad but detailed grasp of Reformed theology, but he has also been gifted with the ability to explain complex theology in a way that is both interesting and understandable. That is no common gift.<br /><br />What Is Reformed Theology?, which was formerly published under the more obscure title Grace Unknown, is Sproul's attempt to help others understand the basics of Reformed theology. Surprisingly, only fifty percent of the book is dedicated to a discussion of the Five Points. The first half provides the foundations for Reformed theology which so many similar books have overlooked. Without first understanding the foundations, the reader will have a much more difficult time understanding the Five Points. And so Sproul begins by discussing God's sovereignty; the importance of Scripture as the only infallible rule for our faith; faith alone; Christ's threefold office of Prophet, Priest and King; and Covenant Theology. Each of these is explained in detail, yet with sufficient precision that they are simple enough to understand.<br /><br />The second half of the book is an examination of the Five Points of Calvinism: Total Depravity, Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistible Grace and Perseverence of the Saints. Like many other theologians, Sproul has come to see that this acrostic, while helpful, does as much to obscure the points as it does to clarify them. Sproul prefers to speak of Radical Corruption, Sovereign Choice, Purposeful Atonement, Effective Calling and Preservation of the Saints. These terms do much to clarify common misunderstandings. For example, it is easy to assume from the term \\"Total Depravity\\" that Reformed Christians believe humans are exactly as evil and depraived as they could be - their depravity is total. Yet Reformed theology teaches that while humans are corrupt, and even radically corrupt, they are so in extent, not in degree. Depravity extends to every aspect of the person, but thanks to the grace of God the degree may be more or less.<br /><br />I must note that as helpful as this book is, it is not one to give your unsaved friend. Sproul assumes knowledge of the Bible and of Christian theology. Even a young Christian may have a difficult time wrestling with some of the terms and concepts. It is ideal, though, for the Reformed believer who is seeking to clarify his beliefs or for the non-Reformed Christian who wants to understand what Reformed theology is all about.<br /><br />Accessible, biblical and educational, this is one of the best books I have read on the subject, and it just so happens that I have read quite a few. Sproul has done Christianity a service by so clearly articulating the foundations and beliefs of Reformed theology. Needless to say, I give it my recommendation.ristians believe humans are exactly as evil and depraived as they could be - their depravity is total.

The first is books that often address cultural issues or specific issues within the church. This includes books like Hard to Believe or Ashamed of the Gospel. The other category is books that are drawn from sermons series he preaches to his congregation at Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California. The Fulfilled Family, the lastest in a long line of MacArthur's books, falls squarely in the second category. This book began as a series of sermons expositing Ephesians 5. It is no more and no less than what we have come to expect of John MacArthur - well-written, deep, challenging, and above all else, firmly biblical.<br /><br />The book is divided into five chapters of roughly equal length. There is one chapter for each of the family, the wife, the husband, the child and the parents. Following the theme of the book, each chapter exposits a portion of the fifth chapter of Ephesians and other parallel texts.<br /><br />The theme of the book is the importance of mutual submission. This is not the mutual submission taught by those who would have us believe in the equality of roles between men and women, but the mutual submission exemplified by Christ Himself. Husband, wife and children are all called to be submissive to one another, being clothed in humility. This is the very core of Christlike character. \\"As Christians, this is the mentality that should govern all our relationships: 'In lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not only for his own interests,but also for the interest of others' (Phil.2:3-4)\\" (page 10).<br /><br />This theme pervades each chapter as MacArthur calls for wives to submit to their husbands, for husbands to honor their wives, for children to respect their parents and for parents to love their children. Ultimately a family can only be a fulfilled family by following God's divine plan for family life.<br /><br />A short book, at only 126 pages, The Fulfilled Family provides a challenge for any believer. After all, every one of us is either a husband, a wife or a child. It is the type of book that makes an ideal gift. While there are more thorough books on the family (including some written by John MacArthur) this one does what it sets out to do - provide biblical wisdom to address the constant challenges facing the divine plan for the family. Needless to say, I recommend this book.hort book, at only 126 pages, The Fulfilled Family provides a challenge for any believer. After all, every one of us is either a husband, a wife or a child.

Apparently John Stott never received the memo. Why I Am A Christian is not Blue Like Jazz or a story the Emergent crowd would support. Instead it is a logical, biblical examination of the claims of Christ and the reasons John Stott is a Christian.<br /><br />The book was inspired by a public address delivered by Bertrand Russell's in 1927 entitled \\"Why I Am Not A Christian.\\" While the book does not directly interact with Russell's arguments, it does provide the opposite perspective. Through seven chapters Stott provides seven reasons that he is a Christian and an invitation for the reader to join him in the kingdom. Here are the six reasons Stott is a Christian:<br /><br />  1. Because the Hound of Heaven relentlessly pursued him. He did not find Christ; rather, Christ found him.<br /><br />  2. Because he is convinced that the claims of Christ are true.<br /><br />  3. Because of the cross of Christ which gives Jesus His credibility.<br /><br />  4. Because Christianity best explains the paradox of our humanity.<br /><br />  5. Because Jesus Christ is the key to freedom.<br /><br />  6. Because only Christ can fulfill many of the most basic human longings and aspirations.<br /><br />The book concludes with \\"the greatest of all invitations\\" - an invitation for the reader to receive Jesus as Lord and Savior.<br /><br />The book is well-written and generally theologically-sound. It is, on the whole, consistent with a Reformed understanding of the faith. The only real concern I had was with several references to Malcolm Muggeridge whom Stott refers to as an example of another man (along with himself, the apostle Paul, Augustine and C.S. Lewis) who was pursued by the Hound of Heaven. This choice seems inconsistent with much of the theology taught within the book, as Muggeridge was, of course, a devout Roman Catholic. I suppose this is consistent with Stott's recent ecumenical leanings. It is too bad as it calls into question what Stott really believes.<br /><br />Why I Am A Christian is a good book and one I can recommend with only a small amount of hesitation. It is well-suited to provide to a friend or family-member who is interested in learning more about the Christian faith. It is a good \\"giveaway\\" book. I can't say that it would be my first choice, but you could certainly do far worse.suppose this is consistent with Stott's recent ecumenical leanings.

They suggested Father, Son & Holy Spirit by Bruce Ware. I know of Bruce Ware from his excellent critique of Open Theism in Their God is Too Small (which was a condensed version of a larger work on the same subject, God's Lesser Glory). A quick look at Amazon showed only one reader review which seems to prove that this book was, indeed, overlooked.<br /><br />Having read the book I agree with Crossway's assessment. This book is a treasure and one that deserves to be read, absorbed and appreciated. It is a thorough but readable study of the Trinity, their Relationships, Roles and Relevance. The final word of that, the book's subtitle, is what sets this book apart. Ware does more than merely provide a defense of the doctrine of the Trinity. Each aspect of the doctrine is accompanied by an explanation of why this doctrine is relevant and how the reader can apply this to his life. This is a perfect example of practical theology - taking theology out of the realm of knowledge and making it a part of our lives.<br /><br />Like many books on theological subject matters, this one began as a series of sessions delivered at a conference. The five one-hour speeches have been adapted into a 167-page, six-chapter book. The first chapter deals with the importance of the doctrine of the Trinity. Ware correctly asserts that few things can be more important than studying and understanding, in so far as we are able, the character and persons of God. \\"It is my hope and prayer that, through this study, we will be able to hear the voice of the Lord helping us to understand the beauty and glory of the God whom we already know as God. But do we know him as we should? Do we know him as he truly is?\\" (page 14). The second chapter provides an overview of the historical development of the doctrine as Christians came to a deeper understanding of biblical truths through the history of the church.<br /><br />The heart of the book is in chapters three, four and five. There is one chapter dedicated to each of the three persons of God. In particular, Ware examines the relationships of the members to each other. While each member of the Trinity is fully God, what defines one from the other is their particular roles and relationships. For example, the way in which the Son relates to the Father is presented in clear contrast to the Son's relationship with the Holy Spirit. In each chapter the reader is led to marvel at the wonder that is our God. Each chapter concludes with a section where the author provides application of all that he has taught about the relationships within the Trinity.<br /><br />The final chapter encourages the believer to behold the wonder of the triune persons in relational community. The chapter is composed of ten \\"lessons for our lives and ministries from the relationships and roles of the triune God.\\" Each lesson is practical, understandable and biblical.<br /><br />What can I say? Taking theology to the masses does not get much better than this. Bruce Ware has taken his extensive knowledge of this doctrine and provided it to the church in a format that anyone can enjoy and understand. There is enough content to challenge any believer, but it is simple enough that none need be intimidated by it.

At that time I expended some effort in thinking about how much sin and evil it is proper for a Christian to portray in a story. Is it profitable for an author to spend so much time plotting a story that contains such great evil? And is it profitable for us to then read about these acts of violence and rebellion against God? I found that while Dekker may have towed a line, I don't know that he crossed it. I quickly read another of his books, Blink and my concerns eased just a little bit.<br /><br />As part of my long-weekend relaxation, I decided I would try one more of Dekker's books. My wife had recently purchased Obsessed, his latest work. My concerns are now back stronger than ever.<br /><br />Obsessed is a story about, and you may have guessed this, obsession. And I'm not talking about the overpriced scent by Calvin Klein either. As with many great thrillers, this one has two parallel plot lines, seperated by twenty years, that slowly begin to converge. I suppose that means that are not really parallel or they'd never meet. Anyways, the first tells the story of two Jewish women, Marth and Ruth, and their imprisonment in a Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War. Their relationship with the camp's commandant provides the basis for the story's primary tale of obsession. The second story involves Stephen Friedman, an unassuming realtor who is dragged into a mystery by an obsessed murderer - the son of the commandant, who seeks to return to his father something that was taken from him long ago. You know how it goes. All sorts of characters are killed, safes are cracked, near-strangers fall in love and ordinary people act like Indiana Jones. It has everything we have come to expect from a good thriller. It is a page-turner and I was drawn right into it. I genuinely cared about the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen next. My wife was forced to make a couple of jokes about the title and its application to me when I showed a complete inability to put the book down.<br /><br />The book seeks to answer the question of just how far a man will go to satisfy his thirst for the ultimate treasure. With Dekker's other books, it becomes clear that beneath the surface of Obsessed is a spiritual metaphor - one about the lengths a man will go to seek and find the kingdom of God.<br /><br />But the book wasn't all good. As with his others works, Dekker seems to introduce characters quickly and at the beginning this can get a bit confusing. I had to force my way into the story, though only for the first four or five chapters. There were also a couple of throw-away characters and plot elements that were left hanging and never resolved. And some of the story was a little bit implausible. I can only roll my eyes when a man dressed as a woman escapes the notice of a person who is sworn to destroy him, despite talking directly to him while in drag. Unlikely at best. Meanwhile, the plot seems to spin a little out of control until by the end the reader hardly knows what to think or believe anymore. Perhaps there were one or two twists too many.<br /><br />Of greater concern was the darkness of the evil in this story. It is one thing to portray an evil person, but when these characters are involved in satanic rituals, draining blood from their victims and drinking it, it seems that a line has been crossed, even if the deeds are portrayed with a minimum of detail. At some point should we not need to heed the apostle's warning to \\"Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret\\" (Ephesians 5:11,12)? At what point do we cease to even speak of the deeds done in darkness? I cannot say, but I do know that the sheer depravity of the deeds in this book made me uncomfortable, and I'm no prude. I thought back to when I used to read thrillers of this type and realized that many good authors have been able to develop \\"bad guys\\" without resorting to such evil deeds. Jeffrey Archer can develop an antagonist the reader learns to despise but without having the men shed a drop of blood. And so I wonder if it is really necessary to speak about such evil deeds or if a superb writer can build a strong character without them. Food for thought.<br /><br />So while I very much enjoyed the story and can even hesitantly recommend it, I do so with a view to the caveats mentioned above. Do we need to portray such evil? At this point I just don't know so will leave it to the reader to decide. In the meantime, I will look forward to Dekker's next book, due in September of this year and trust that I will have clarified my position by that time.f this type and realized that many good authors have been able to develop \\"bad guys\\" without resorting to such evil deeds.

That is quite a claim, but one I am more willing to believe as I continue to read Ryken's work. Until a few weeks ago I knew little about the man, having encountered him only as co-author of a book he wrote with James Boice. But then I read his book City on a Hill and so enjoyed it that I almost immediately turned to He Speaks to me Everywhere.<br /><br />During evening services at the church he pastors, Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Ryken delivers not only a sermon, but also a short cultural reflection. He Speaks to me Everywhere is a compilation of fifty of these commentaries divided into nine broad categories. Topics range from Muslim dress code, to pressing theological errors of our time; from sports and recreation to the acts of terrorism on September 11th; from the Church Mothers to Intelligent Design. These commentaries show a man who knows the issues that people in our culture, believer and unbeliever alike, struggle to understand.<br /><br />A pastor who is wholly disconnected from our culture (and I have known many who are) will have less to offer our world than one who heeds the admonition I have heard attributed to many pastors or theologians - that a good pastor keeps the Bible in one hand and the newspaper in the other. I once sat through a sermon where the pastor lamented the state of the church, exclaiming that now \\"even the church has its own rocks and its own rolls.\\" It is sad when Christians keep themselves so far removed from the world. A pastor who coaches a team in the community, who keeps up with what is popular in the culture and who knows what people read, watch and listen to, will have a superior ability to build bridges with unbelievers.<br /><br />But Ryken does not examine culture simply for the sake of keeping up. No, he does so to show that theology is not an obscure, irrelevant pursuit. Instead he shows that the Bible, through which we study God, is relevant to every area of life. Far from being mere personal opinion, these commentaries continually point to the Word of God as the key to understand all that happens in the world around us.<br /><br />While I do not consider this book required reading, I very much enjoyed it and am happy to recommend it to anyone. It is easy to read and is divided into chapters only two or three pages in length, so can be read in short increments. Ryken provides a great model as to how we, as believers, can be in the world, but never of the world. We can know, understand and appreciate aspects of our culture, while still maintaining strong, biblical standards. And most of all, we can find in the Bible all that is necessary to react to our culture and to stand strong in the faith.

For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.\\" So says the apostle Paul in the first chapter of his letter to the Romans. For the Christian, we see God's eternality and divinity displayed in all that He has made. We look at the world around us and know that design presupposes a Designer. But this is not clear to those who, by their worldview and their hatred of God, deny Him.<br /><br />Incredible Creatures That Defy Evolution I is the first in a series of DVDs presenting animals that have features which evolution simply cannot explain. It is hosted by David Hames and features commentary by Dr. Jobe Martin, a former evolutionist who is now a convinced creationist. Dr. Martin is a capable, charismatic speaker whose excitement is contagious as speaks about some animals we are all too familiar with, and some most of us have probably never heard of. The consistent theme is that each of these animals has body parts or functions that could not possibly have evolved over time. There is no such thing as a partial lung, a partial heart or a partial liver. And dead animals do not evolve.<br /><br />Take the giraffe. The giraffe requires an incredibly powerful heart to pump blood against gravity all the way to the top of that long neck. But in order to drink the giraffe has to lower his head. Under normal circumstances this simple act would cause such a rush of blood to the head that the animal would immediately have an aneurysm and die. The powerful pump would cause such pressure that it would quite literally blow his brains out. But the giraffe has some special features that allow for this. But what happens if a lion suddenly approaches? We would expect that the giraffe would quickly raise his head, run two steps, and fall down in a feint for lack of blood to his head. As the lion began to eat him, the giraffe would be thinking that he really needs to evolve some way of combatting this. But dead animals do not evolve. God saw this eventuality and designed the giraffe in such a way that he can immediately normalize his blood pressure. This is only one of ten or twelve examples provided by Dr. Martin. Each one is explained simply and convincingly. Some will make you laugh, some will probably cause your jaw to drop, and all of them will cause you to appreciate God just a little bit more.<br /><br />If I had to find an area where the DVD could do with improvement I would suggest that the presentation could benefit from more video and less photography. I have been spoiled by the amazing quality of video produced by National Geographic and many other studios, and would liked to have seen a little more video of that quality in Incredible Creatures That Defy Evolution I. Parenthetically, I will point out that further episodes in this series (reviews coming soon) address this concern.<br /><br />I believe my five year old son enjoyed this presentation every bit as much as I did. It is ideal for the entire family. Watch it and I'm sure you will react the same way I did - with awe towards the Creator who made such a variety of creatures and designed each one with such detail and intricacy. He truly does reveal Himself through His Creation.<br /><br />This video is not an apologetic for defending Creationism, but neither is it intended to be such. It simply and straightforwardly presents some incredible creatures which stand as evidence of God's power and divinity. It would make a perfect addition to a church, school or public library. And of course it would be a welcome addition to your personal library. Well-produced, informative and lots of fun, I highly recommend this DVD.feint for lack of blood to his head.

Apart from her Bible (the most beat-up, ink-covered, personalized Bible you'll ever see) and a few commentaries, she reads only biographies. She feels that by reading about the lives of great Christians of the past, she will learn far more than what most of the Christian Living books can teach her. She may just be right.<br /><br />Faithful Women & Their Extraordinary God is Noel Piper's second solo effort that is targetted at an adult audience (she has previously authored Treasuring God in Our Traditions and has written the children's book Most Of All, Jesus Loves You.). The book contains five short biographies of five faithful women: Sarah Edwards, Lilias Trotter, Gladys Aylward, Esther Ahn Kim and Helen Roseveare.<br /><br />I particularly enjoy short biographies of this type as they provide only a glimpse of a person. If one of the people particularly intrigues me, I can seek out a more exhaustive biography. This book serves as an introduction to five particularly fascinating servants of the Lord - women who have in some way had a significant impact on the author. While the women are bound by a common thread, their zeal in serving the Lord, they represent several countries and hundreds of years of Christian history. Sarah Edwards lived in the New World during the mid-1700's and was best-known for selflessly supporting and extending the ministry of her husband, Jonathan Edwards; Lilias Trotter grew up in Victorian England but served God as a missionary in North Africa; Gladys Alward left her native England in 1932 so she could serve the Lord in China; Esther Ahn Kim stood strong among the persecuted ranks of believers during the Japanese occupation of Korea; Helen Roseveare became a doctor to the native population of the Congo, remaining there through years of war and bloodshed. Each of these women suffered in their own way, but did so joyfully, knowing that they suffered for the Lord.<br /><br />A great deal of the value of this book lies in the author's closing comments for each of the sections. Piper adds a personal touch to each biography, describing what it is about the person that has so touched her. She ends each of the chapters with a dedication to a person whose life and faith exhibits the same qualities as the woman just described. For example, at the end of the first chapter she writes, \\"Just as Sarah Edwards had little idea of the ongoing generations she would influence through her interaction with Samuel Hopkins, there are two women who probably have little notion of their impact on me and therefore also on my husband, children, friends, and church. Long before my husband was called to a pulpit ministry, I admired our pastors' wives, one in California, one in Minnesota. God used them to help prepare me for my future role that none of us yet expected. And so this story of Sarah Edwards is dedicated to Deloris Hoeldtke and Ann Ortlund.\\"<br /><br />I was transfixed as I read of these faithful women, and in some ways was also transformed. As I came to understand the faith of these Christians who gave so much, I came to see where I have been holding back. I came to understand that the religious freedom we enjoy as North Americans sometimes allows us to have a lazy faith. As I came to understand these women, I came to understand God just a little bit better. And if that is the ultimate purpose of any Christian biography, which I believe it ought to be, Noel Piper has done well with Faithful Women & Their Extraordinary God. I am glad to recommend this book to you.<br /><br />While this book has equal appeal for men or women, I would suggest it may make an excellent text for a five- or six-part study for women's groups. My wife is reading it right now with a view to using it for just that purpose.own way, but did so joyfully, knowing that they suffered for the Lord. <br /> <br />A great deal of the value of this book lies in the author's closing comments for each of the sections.

US	43519458	R1DS1KLMUE1BTV	1581346972	372361358	Sex and the Supremacy of Christ	Books	5	89	90	N	N	Collection of Vast Wisdom	It is always big news when a new book is released under John Piper's name. Sex and the Supremacy of Christ, while listing Piper as a co-editor, contains only a few pages of Piper's writing, with the rest being written by eleven other authors. The book is divided into five parts and eleven chapters. Allow me to provide a brief overview of each of these.<br /><br />The first part is entitled \\"God and Sex.\\" The first two chapters comprise John Piper's contribution to the book. Piper asserts two weighty points. First, that sexuality is designed by God as a way to know God in Christ more fully. Second, that knowing God in Christ more fully is designed as a way of guarding and guiding our sexuality. Essentially he wants the reader to believe that sex was given to us so that God could use the language of sex as metaphor so we could know Him more fully. He makes quite a weak attempt at proving this assertion with passages from Ezekiel and Hosea. Unfortunately he is far from convincing and offers no substantial proof. While what he states may be true, and God may have created sexuality as a way to know God in Christ more fully, I do not find that Scripture explicitly tells us so. Thankfully these chapters are short and the book soon picks up steam.<br /><br />The third chapter, written by Ben Patterson, tells us that sex is good because the God who created sex is good. God is glorified greatly when we receive His gift with thanksgiving and enjoy it the way he meant for it to be enjoyed. We can only glorify God in our sexuality when we use it as He intends for us to use it.<br /><br />The second section deals with \\"Sin and Sex.\\" The highlight of the entire book is David Powlison's chapter on \\"Restoring Pure Joy to the Sexually Broken.\\" He provides biblical wisdom and encouragment for people who have abused sex, or who have been sexually abused. His counsel is loving and pastoral and will surely bring a glimpse of light to many for whom sex has become darkness. Many books have a chapter which alone validates the purchase of the book, and I would suggest that for Sex and the Supremacy of Christ, it is definitely this chapter.<br /><br />Albert Mohler takes over for the fifth chapter and writes about homosexual marriage being a challenge to the church. As always Mohler is well-researched and insightful. He counsels Christians to love homosexuals (and every other person) more than these people love their sin, but still to see homosexual marriage as a frontal assault on the institution of marriage. While homosexuality is a grave sin, we must not regard it as being the worst of all sins (as we are prone to believe). While it is surely an awful sin in God's eyes, we are all sinners and not one of us is innocent when it comes to sexual sin.<br /><br />Part three deals with \\"Men and Sex.\\" Mark Dever and several co-authors challenge single men to live lives of sexual purity. They encourage men to adopt courtship as a model, for they feel it is more biblical than dating. I am not entirely convinced of this, but when I think of my daughter beginning a relationship some day, I certainly hope she courts instead of casually dates. This chapter is very similar to what one would read in any of Josh Harris' books.<br /><br />Chapter seven is written by C.J. Mahaney and is entitled \\"Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God.\\" This is the first I have read of Mahaney but very much enjoyed this chapter and hope to read more of his books. He provides wisdom from The Song of Solomon and interprets this book as being about sex and not being primarily an allegory for God's relationship to His church - an assessment I agree with. He challenges the married man to ensure that he has touched his wife's heart and mind before he touches her body and provides many practical pointers for doing just that.<br /><br />Part four, \\"Women and Sex,\\" is comprised of two chapters, and as with the men, the first of these deals with single women and the second with those who are married. Caroyln McCulley encourages women to be content with their singleness and helps women see how they can even be a snare to marriages if they are not careful. Carolyn Mahaney writes for married women. The chapter is short and not awfully informative. It includes a fairly typical list of encouragement for wives - be attractive, be available, be anticipatory, be aggressive and be adventuresome.<br /><br />The final section deals with history and sex. Justin Taylor writes about Martin Luther's sexual revolution, showing the importance of Luther's contribution to the Protestant understanding of marriage and sexuality. Mark Dever closes the book with a chapter examining the Puritans and their understanding of sex.<br /><br />Like most books which are written by several authors, Sex and the Supremacy of Christ seemed a little uneven. The chapters did not always flow naturally from one to the next, and some were far better than others. However, it is safe to say that while there are not many people who would find equal value in each of the chapters, any reader, whether married or single, male or female, will find at least a few of them exceedingly valuable. The collective wisdom of these men and women of God is a valuable contribution to understanding that sex is given by God and is to be used for His glory. I recommend this book..

US	43519458	R3Q29Q2S6KKNE	0976035790	86818720	Adventures in Holy Matrimony: For Better or the Absolute Worst	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An Enjoyable Read	I am not a big fan of Relevant Magazine. In my mind it represents a flavor of Christianity that seeks to appeal to the world by being cool and hip. It's Christianity with frosted hair and all the right labels of clothing. So when I am asked to read a book published by Relevant I am a little bit apprehensive, which I will admit is probably not fair of me. Adventures in Holy Matrimony by Julie Anne Fidler asks the questions, \\"When happens when the storybook wedding is over? What happens when the white picket fence you dreamed of turns out to be not-so-white and just a little dangerous?\\" In other words, what happens when real life so rudely interrupts a storybook romance?<br /><br />Through a book that is a mixture of topical and chronological narrative, Fidler tells the story of her life as it relates to her eventual marriage. It is a story of baggage - emotional, sexual and medical. Few details are spared as the reader learns about the many difficult circumstances she faced when growing up. In some of these, such as the sexual abuse she suffered as a child she was a victim, and in others, such as drinking, partying and sexual activity as as teenager she was a willing participant. Eventually she met a wonderful man and after a whirlwind romance became engaged and married. And then real life began.<br /><br />Fidler tells about the difficulties they faced as they dealt with all of the baggage she brought to her marriage, the medical problems her husband faced and the financial difficulties they went through as a result. These two went through more trauma in the first few years of their marriage than many will ever go through. And when they were weakest, ready to walk their seperate ways, God intervened and bound them back together.<br /><br />There is sometimes a fine line between providing information and being something of an exhibitionist. Generally I think Fidler stayed on the right side of that line. The message and purpose of Fidler's book is simple: don't give up and don't give in. If God can save a marriage as messy as her's, He is capable of saving any marriage.<br /><br />Perhaps the most helpful information in the book comes as Fidler begins to summarize the lessons she and her husband learned from their experiences - lessons she is hoping to pass along to the reader. On page 130 she writes, \\"It is ... the church's responsibility to shift the focus away from saving doomed marriages to preventing their demise from the moment a man and a woman says, \\"I do.\\" Indeed the church could benefit from being proactive in saving marriage rather than reactive in saving them once they are already in troubled waters. I would say that churches should begin trying to prevent the demise of marriage from long before \\"I do\\" by modelling godly families and by requiring biblical marriage counselling. On the same page the author states her belief that where most people believe sex is the ultimate intimacy, in reality prayer is the ultimate intimacy. I agree entirely.<br /><br />While the theology Fidler shares is generally quite solid, there was one particular area that gave me concern. One page 125 she writes, \\"I would also never fault anyone for getting a divorce. Regardless of my personal stance on the issue, it is definitely not the unforgiveable sin.\\" While divorce can be forgiven, it is a very serious offense in God's eyes and needs to be treated as such. The words \\"my personal stance\\" seem to smack of a postmodern attitude that relegates morality to a realm of personal values that may or may not be binding on others. God is clear that we may have to fault people for their sin so that the church can reprimand and even discipline them if necessary. What is strange is that the text of the book seemed to contradict this statement. In a book about not giving up, Fidler seems to leave an \\"out\\" as if to indicate that this book was merely her opinion and to treat it as such. I suspect she did not mean it in that way, but the statement could give that idea.<br /><br />I found the book a generally enjoyable, though sometimes uncomfortable read, as I am usually not very interested in the personal details of other people's lives. Yet much of this information was necessary to help others see that God can save any marriage. I suppose I could recommend this book to young couples who are anticipating marriage. It would teach them the value of dealing with baggage of all sorts long before rings are exchanged. It would also provide assurance that with God's help any marriage can not only survive, but can thrive. While Adventures in Holy Matrimony is certainly no substitute for proper pre-marriage, pastoral counselling, it may be a helpful complement to it.nt could give that idea. <br /> <br />I found the book a generally enjoyable, though sometimes uncomfortable read, as I am usually not very interested in the personal details of other people's lives.

A bit of an odd request, is it not? Obviously I already knew something about prayer if I was praying about it in the first place, but my concern was that despite my prayer habits, which are sometimes good and sometimes bad, I have often felt that I just don't really understand what prayer is all about. When I pray I've often wondered just what the point is. I've often wished that I was better at praying and that maybe God would answer a few more of my prayers if I just learned to pray like a Spurgeon or another great preacher of days gone by whose words to God can still stir hearts even today.<br /><br />I believe God answered my prayer through Bryan Chapell and his book Praying Backwards.<br /><br />For many Christians, and especially those who were raised in households that emphasized prayer, the words \\"in Jesus name, amen!\\" are prayer mainstays. They close prayer and for most of us mean something along the lines of \\"well that's done, open your eyes!\\" or \\"I really mean it!\\" Chapell premises his book on taking \\"in Jesus name\\" and placing it at the beginning of the prayer (hence \\"praying backwards\\"). This was a lesson I learned a short time ago through a wonderful article written by Jim Elliff. He taught the same - that from the beginning of our prayers we need to emphasize that we are praying in the name of Jesus, and not coming before God with a view to our own sufficiency or merit. Even if we do not verbalize the words \\"in Jesus name\\" as we begin our prayers, we need to commit never to pray a prayer that we could not pray backwards. In other words, we need to test the motives of our hearts before we begin to pour out our petitions to the Lord and ensure that we are praying prayers that honor Him and not ourselves.<br /><br />Further topics Chapell writes about are praying in Jesus' way, praying without doubting, praying in the Spirit, praying boldly, praying expectantly, praying persistently, praying in God's will and praying in God's wisdom.<br /><br />Many books are \\"front-loaded\\" with the best chapters at the beginning of the book and the weaker ones at the back. This book has two of the strongest, most challenging chapters right near the end. There are two chapters that discuss praying within God's will. Chapell challenges the reader to praying within two fences, the fence of righteousness and the fence of Christian prudence. Through these chapters he provides a primer not only on praying in God's will, but also discerning His will. The fence of righteousness ensures that we are only praying for what God does not condemn in His Word. We can discern His will by asking Him for the wisdom and courage to abide by His Word, and can then move forward with confidence as we examine multiple options. If we need additional insight, God may prompt us through His Holy Spirit who is our internal witness. Chapell is careful to guard against allowing subjective feelings to become the standard of right and wrong or good and bad.<br /><br />The final chapter warns against hindrances to prayer and then concludes with a thought that greatly expanded my understanding of prayer. There are those who see prayer as a dialogue, where we speak to God and He speaks to us. This is not biblical. There are those (like I did) who see prayer as a monologue, where we speak to God and He merely listens. Chapell teaches that prayer is, in reality, a dynamic monologue where it is almost as if God is speaking to Himself. \\"In this speaking to God, the Spirit of heaven stirs the spirit of the believer to speak to the heavenly Father. The intercession of the Son carries this prayer to the ear and heart of the Father. Then in deference to the voice of his Son with whom the believer is united, the Father lovingly responds. He causes the thoughts and inclinations fo the believer both to engage the divine will (to accomplish God's purposes) and to inform the human will (to desire and perform God'spurposes). When we speak to God, his words in us create the world before us in which He is working\\" (page 177). As we work out our salvation, our hearts are transformed by the Spirit to make us more like the Son so we can desire that which is pleasing to the Father. Thus we ask for what God lays on our hearts through the work of His Spirit through the Word.<br /><br />This book was such a joy to me. It removed a burden I have so often felt in prayer, that I need to say, feel or know just the right things in order to make my prayer effective. But I had never fully understood the Spirit's role in prayer, that He intercedes in every prayer, taking my limited, far-too-human perspective, and presenting to the Father a prayer that is beyond time and space - a prayer that is formed through the Spirit's omniscience. No wonder, then, that God can and will answer prayer! I know now that my role is not to feel the need to pray great prayers, but it is to continue to grow in godliness - for even the simplest prayers can be pure and sweet to the Father - that I may more and more resemble the Son to whom I am united.<br /><br />Before I conclude I wanted to mention a couple of features in this book I found particularly helpful. Each chapter concludes with a Key Thought. Each of these key thoughts summarizes the content of the chapter in just a few sentences. This helps the reader formulate his thoughts and ensure he has retained the important points before moving to the next topic. I found this immeasurably helpful. Following each Key Thought is a prayer which puts into practice the cumulative teachings of the book to that point. This is also a very helpful feature.<br /><br />Praying Backwards was an answer to prayer. The subtitle to this book is \\"Transform Your Prayer Life By Beginning In Jesus' Name.\\" I truly feel that Chapell's teaching, drawn directly from the Scriptures, will transform the prayer lives of many of God's people, and for that I am most thankful. I simply cannot recommend this book enough.orm God's purposes). When we speak to God, his words in us create the world before us in which He is working\\" (page 177).

But what is harder to discern is where the light ends and the darkness begins. Where is the point where the light has ended and dark has overtaken? To take this question to a spiritual realm, when has a Christian left the edge of the light of truth and entered the darkness of error? It is this daunting question that Ed Stetzer and Elmer Towns seek to explore in Perimeters of Light: Biblical Boundaries for the Emerging Church.<br /><br />Before I proceed I would like to point out that throughout this book, \\"emerging church\\" is not capitalized. Hence the authors are referring to the evangelical church as it struggles to find its identity in our newly postmodern society (as it emerges from modernism into postmodernism), and are not referring to the subset of this, popularly known as the Emerging (or Emergent) Church. This book contains no references to Brian McLaren, Dan Kimball, Leonard Sweet, or any of the other leaders of the Emergent conversation. Having said all of that, this book is still relevant to that discussion, as the authors seek to define biblical boundaries for what is and what is not Christian. They try to define just how much the church can change and adapt before it is no longer the church.<br /><br />Woven throughout the text is a parable of two missionaries, which describes two men who are trying to reach an isolated tribe in Papua New Guinea. Their trek through the jungle emphasizes the importance of keeping a light flickering in the darkness, and their struggles in presenting the gospel to the tribesmen describes many of the issues we face in presenting the gospel to our postmodern family, friends and neighbors. The authors correctly believe that in a post-Christian culture like our own, the difficulties we face are much the same as those faced by missionaries taking the good news to cultures that have never known God. There are surprising similarities between a post-Christian culture and a non-Christian culture.<br /><br />Among the difficult issues the authors wrestle with are: what makes something Christian? (when has a Christian left the light and entered darkness?); the difference between meanings and forms (how and why are decisions in Christian ministry often based on preference and culture instead of the truth of Scripture?); and boundaries in practice (where is the perimeter between true evangelism and unbiblical evangelism?). Following discussion of each of these areas, they seek to apply them to five spheres: church, worship, music, preaching and evangelism.<br /><br />In discussing the church, Towns and Stetzer define the church and describe the elements that identify a body we can legitimately refer to as a church. They also try to help the reader understand when a church is no longer a church according to biblical standards.<br /><br />The chapter on worship avoids becoming bogged down in discussions about the \\"worship wars\\" which plagued the church until recently (and in many places continue to do so). They talk about the dangers of consumer worship, wherein people attend church in order to have their needs met, rather than to engage in genuine worship of God. They include a helpful section where they try to answer the question of \\"what makes worship Christian?.\\"<br /><br />The discussion then turns to music where the authors again refuse to participate in the worship wars. They teach that God has no stylistic musical preference.

The balance of the chapter is spent describing different ways of formatting an expositional sermon and ensuring that the listeners will hear and remember it.<br /><br />Finally the authors turn to evangelism, presenting several of the traditional charts and diagrams used to show the process of evangelism and the way different people respond to the gospel.

US	43519458	RQXU42LYL1TZ2	0802441998	169240543	City on a Hill: Reclaiming the Biblical Pattern for the Church in the 21st Century	Books	4	18	18	N	N	Recommended!	I wonder if it has always been true that when people write about the church they write with sadness, lamenting what the church has become or is becoming. In our day we have the church growth advocates bemoaning the fact that not enough churches engage in full-scale marketing of their churches; we have the Emergent Church leaders lamenting the church's refusal to adapt to and engage with the changing culture; and we have conservatives calling us to return to the pillars of faith the church once held dear.<br /><br />I, sometimes reluctantly, find myself predominantly in the third camp, though I sometimes also wonder if we really are doing so poorly. Philip Graham Ryken is also clearly in the third camp. He assumed the pastorate of Ten Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia after the death of James Boice with whom he co-authored the wonderful book The Doctrines of Grace. As if to prove his allegiance, he subtitled this book \\"Reclaiming the Biblical Pattern for the Church in the 21st Century.\\" As with leaders of the other camps, Ryken examines the culture and seeks to find ways in which the church can fulfill it's God-given mandate to be a city on a hill.<br /><br />This book began with a ministry retreat in early 1999 in which Ryken and the leadership of his church engaged in discussion about being a church that could successfully fulfill God's mandate in the post-Christian 21st century. When he succeeded Boice as pastor of Tenth, Ryken began his ministry by preaching a series of sermons on the seven committments of his church's mission statement. These messages form the basis for the book. Because of this they do read a little bit like sermons (which is not necessarily a bad thing).<br /><br />City on a Hill begins with an introduction to postmodernism. Ryken identifies these post-Christian times as being characterized by relativism and narcissism. In order to combat those forces and to be a remedy to society, the church needs to return to the model of the 1st century church - a church that was modelled on teaching, worshiping and caring. These three forces, when combined, caused the church to grow. Ryken identifies seven objectives for the church: expository preaching, worthy worship, Bible study and fellowship, pastoral care, educational programs, missionary work and service to the church and community. Each of these objectives forms a chapter in the book.<br /><br />While these objectives are hardly unique, and could as easily be found in a book written by John MacArthur or any of the other Reformed or conservative church leaders, Ryken does something that gives this book great value. He shows how relativism and narcissism negatively impacts each of these seven objectives, and also shows how returning to the biblical model can be an antidote to the influences that pervade our culture. For example, he teaches that in a post-Christian culture, worship becomes less about Scripture, and less about honoring God, while becoming predominantly about the individual. Church becomes a place where needs are met rather than a place where God is worshiped. He teaches that we need a theology of worship to guide our practice so that we can avoid society's negative influences. In the fifth chapter, which deals with pastoral care, the author teaches that \\"the revolt against the mata-narrative helps explain why people are so resistant to the gospel. Christianity has a story to tell. It claims to be the story, the story of humanity...However in these post-Christian times, people don't want to listen to God's story; they want to make up their own. When they read the script of salvation, they discover that it's all about God and His glory. But they were hoping to play a bigger part. Hence the postmodern revolt against the meta-narrative, which is really a rebellion against the authority of God\\" (page 94).<br /><br />Ryken determines that if we are wise, \\"we will recommit ourselves to expository preaching, God-centered worship, loving fellowship, pastoral care, costly discipleship, global evangelism, and practical compassion. But none of this will matter unless we recognize our need - our daily need - for the gospel. The church can only be a city on a hill if it confesses its sin and trusts in the crucifixion, resurrection, and intercession of Jesus Christ for any hope of salvation\\" (page 179).<br /><br />For the church to succeed in its ministry during the post-Christian era, it must take care that it presents a biblical alternative to the forces of society, all the while ensuring that it does not accomodate them. When church does what it is called to do - to be a city on a hill; a light shining in the darkness - it will give the world what it most needs - the message of life and salvation in and through Jesus Christ.<br /><br />This is a book that is sure to challenge the reader. It is consistently biblical, returning constantly to the Word of God. It calls the church to return not to the model of the twentieth century, but the model given to us in the Bible.

US	43519458	R14H9CCUDXGMYU	B0002H7GIA	964386491	Blink	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Fun Story	If I am going to continue to read Christian fiction (and it seems that I can't escape reading at least some of it) I am going to have to learn how to properly review the genre. How do I say enough about the book to provide the flavor without giving away the integral parts of the plot? And of more concern, how important is it that fiction be doctrinally strong? Do we want to learn from a novel, or do we view it merely as escapism - a few hours of amusement in which we are removed from the real world and are transported into the world of characters whose lives are far more interesting than ours? I'll work through those issues in due time, I suppose. In the meantime, let me tell you about Blink.<br /><br />My introduction to the writing of Ted Dekker came in the form of his novel Three which I read a couple of weeks ago. I found it an engaging read and saw that there was a subtle spiritual theme throughout which really didn't make sense until the last few pages. The book ended with a Bible passage that made it all make sense. Blink, which was written before Three, is far less subtle in its spirituality (and not quite as well-written). This is a book about the future. Ultimately it is a book that explores what humans can know about the future, and what God can know. At times I was somewhat confused as to just what Dekker was telling us. For a few pages I thought perhaps this was going to be a layman's introduction to Open Theism, but I don't think that was Dekker's point. Unfortunately I'll have to leave it there, lest I give away too much and ruin the story.<br /><br />Blink is the story of two people who make a meteoric rise from obscurity to great importance. Seth Borders is one of the smartest men in the world and is suddenly given an incredible ability - he can see multiple potential futures. He crosses paths with a Saudi Arabian princess (a beautiful one, of course) who is on the run from a forced marriage. Together they hold the fate of the world, or the Middle East at any rate, in their hands. You get the idea. The book features all the usual mainstays of this type of novel: car chases, guns, explosions, kissing, really bad Arab guys and deep theology. You can guess which one of those sets it apart from all the other novels on the bookstore shelves.<br /><br />Is it worth reading? Sure. It's good fun. At 400 pages it takes only a lazy Saturday afternoon to read it (or perhaps a Father's Day Sunday afternoon). You can grab a frosty beverage, turn on the U.S. Open, kick up your feet and pretty well turn your brain off for a few hours. Chances are you won't want to stop reading until you've turned the last page. It won't blow your mind or change your life, but it will keep you entertained. And if you buy it from Amazon you can get it for only a few dollars. It's well worth that price.le East at any rate, in their hands. You get the idea.

In the past month I've read biographies, theology and devotionals. I've read about marketing the church, reclaiming the church and new ways of doing church. And now I've read about singlehood, admittedly a topic I know little about. Because my wife and I began dating when I was eighteen and we married when I was twenty-one, I have difficulty relating to the situations of men and women who find themselves single or single again in their late twenties, early thirties and beyond. Because of this I assumed that Single Servings by Lee Warren would have little to offer me. But it turns out that I was wrong.<br /><br />Single Servings is a devotional book targetted at single adults. Author Lee Warren ministers to singles as a columnist for Christianity Online. He has been published in several other publications and often travels to speaking engagements. He is well-qualified to write a book to challenge and encourage other singles.<br /><br />I must admit that because my schedule did not allow me to spend 90 days on a single book, I read the entire book in just a couple of days. I felt afterwards like I had eaten 90 single servings in only a couple of sittings. While I enjoyed it, I know I would have been able to digest more of the book if I had been able to read it the way it was intended.<br /><br />The book is divided into nine parts: Community, Completeness, Emotional Health, Physical Desires, Longing For Love, God's Timing, No Fair, Expectations and Embracing Life. Each of the 90 chapters follows a typical devotional format. It begins with a verse of the Bible and that is followed by the author's reflection. There are also five questions that help apply that day's text.<br /><br />A chapter that especially caught my attention is one entitled \\"Our Spiritual Act of Worship,\\" in which Warren discusses the satisfying of physical desires. He writes, \\"Why then do we as singles dwell on what we're missing? God's people have no rights over their bodies. We have no right to demand that our physical desires get met. God is happy to do so within the context of marriage, and someday he may choose to give us a spouse. But until then we can show our love for him by laying our physical desires on the sacrificial altar as an act of worship. And in so doing, we will experience the joy and contentment that always come from sacrifice\\" (page 95). Insights like that are as valuable to a married man as to a single man. There are plenty of similarly valuable reflections throughout the text.<br /><br />There are a couple of areas I might suggest some improvement. I would liked to have seen some serious interaction with Paul's statement about those who are given the gift of celibacy and how these people differ from those who are single because God has not yet seen fit to bless them with a spouse. The author also writes quite often about hearing God or listening to God's voice, but without indicating whether this is to be done only through Scripture or whether he refers to hearing God's voice through subjective impressions and so on. Clarity in this matter would have been useful. An index of Bible passages would also be welcome for later reference. And while I'm putting together a wishlist, the gratuitous mention of Mother Teresa on the last page could also disappear without harming the book's impact.<br /><br />I found this to be a valuable book, not only in edifying me, but also in helping me to understand the unique challenges faced by singles. Warren works well within a restrictive format. He is transparent without being exhibitionist, vulnerable without being whiny. He does not back down from presenting a serious challenge to single adults. At the same time, he does not offer them false hope or allow them to bemoan their condition. He rightly sees singlehood as an opportunity for great blessing and unrestricted service to the Lord. Singlehood, while it may be difficult, can and should be a great blessing to the church. And Warren clearly hopes that all singles who read his book will accept this challenge. I am happy to recommend this book.Lord. Singlehood, while it may be difficult, can and should be a great blessing to the church. And Warren clearly hopes that all singles who read his book will accept this challenge.

Carson is, as far as I know, the first person to write a book-length treatment evaluating and leveling critiques at the movement. At any rate he is certainly the most widely-respected. And yes, I know the EC leaders prefer to call it a \\"conversation,\\" but since Carson does not shy from calling it a movement, nor will I. In Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church, subtitled \\"Understanding a Movement and its Implications,\\" Carson seeks to introduce the movement, assess it, and address several of the most glaring weaknesses. There are few men who are better suited to this task. Carson is a scholar and is known for his conservative, biblical theology as much as for his sound research and presentation skills. All of those admirable attributes are displayed throughout this book.<br /><br />In the preface Carson writes, \\"Whenever a Christian movement comes along that presents itself as reformist, it should not be summarily dismissed. Even if one ultimately decides that the movement embraces a number of worrying weaknesses, it may also have some important things to say that the rest of the Christian world needs to hear. So I have tried to listen respectfully and carefully; I hope and pray that the leaders of this \\"movement\\" will similarly listen to what I have to say\\" (page 10). That spirit of love and charity pervades the book.<br /><br />The book follows a logical format - introduction, admiration, criticism. The first chapter, \\"The Emerging Church Profile,\\" is an uncritical summary of the Emerging Church. Carson arrives at three conclusions. First, the EC must be evaluated as to its reading of contemporary culture. Second, the EC needs to be evaluated as to its beliefs regarding Scripture. Third, the EC's proposals for moving forward in this postmodern culture need to be examined.<br /><br />The second chapter examines the strengths of the Emerging Church. Carson praises four aspects of the EC. First, they are adept at reading the times and know that the presentation of the Gospel must change with the times. Second, they value authenticity. Third, they recognize the social location of the church, and know that the church is within a cultural context and cannot be removed from it. Fourth, they place high value on evangelism. Fifth, that they probe tradition and seek to build a faith that is rooted in the past while still being relevant to the present.<br /><br />Having shown the strengths of the EC, Carson turns to several weaknesses in the third chapter. He critiques their evaluation and denigration of modernism, their condemnation of confessional Christianity and accuses them of having a view of Christianity under modernism that is both theologically shallow and intellectually incoherent.<br /><br />The fourth chapter serves as an introduction to postmodernism and the postmodern mindset. For those who are unfamiliar with the changing times, and our society's emerging epistemology, this chapter is a valuable introduction.<br /><br />Carson goes on, in chapters five, six and seven to critique the Emerging Church's response to postmodernism. He is especially critical of the EC's handling of truth, and frustrated by their refusal to deal with the tough questions. He finds that more often than not, the EC leaders refuse to deal with the tough questions related to claims of absolute truth. He is also concerned with the EC's stubborn refusal to use Scripture as the norming norm against appeals to tradition, as well as the EC's emphasis on \\"belonging before believing.\\" He deals with two books in some depth - Brian McLaren's A Generous Orthodoxy as well as Steve Chalke's The Lost Message of Jesus, thus representing leaders of the Emerging Church on both sides of the Atlantic. Carson arrives at a chilling conclusion. \\"I have to say, as kindly but as forcefully as I can, that to my mind, if words mean anything, both McLaren and Chalke have largely abandoned the Gospel...I cannot see how their own words constitute anything less than a drift toward abandoning the gospel itself\\" (page 186-187).<br /><br />The book concludes with a list of relevant Bible passages and \\"A Biblical Meditation on Truth and Experience.\\" He closes with a challenge. \\"So which shall we choose? Experience or truth? Damn all false antitheses to hell, for they generate false gods, they perpetuate idols, they twist and distort our souls, they launch the church into violent pendulum swings whose oscillations succeed only in dividing brothers and sisters in Christ...If emerging church leaders wish to become a long-term prophetic voice that produces enduring fruit and that does not drift off toward progressive sectarianism and even, in the worst instances, outright heresy, they must listen at least as carefully to criticisms of their movement as they transparently want others to listen to them...If they manage this self-correction and worry less about who is or who is not emergent and rather more about learning simultaneously to be faithful to the Bible and effective in evangelizing the rising number of alienated biblical illiterates in our culture, they may end up preserving the gains of their movement while helping brothers and sisters who are more culturally conservative than they are learn to reconnect with the culture.\\" (page 234).<br /><br />Carson faced a great difficulty in this book. How does one fairly and adequately critique a movement as eclectic as the Emerging Church? Many have criticized this movement for being so hard to pin down. Carson admits that not every critique he makes will be valid for every person who considers himself a part of this \\"conversation.\\" Yet I feel that McLaren did as well as could be expected, focusing the majority of his attention on those who have the majority of the influence.<br /><br />My concerns with the book are twofold. First, while the Emerging Church is emerging at the popular level, this book is written to appeal more to scholars and to those who are well-versed in theology than to the neophyte. If it is true, as Carson claims, that most Emerging leaders come from a fundamentalist background, then perhaps this is appropriate. But I am not sure that this book offers a lot by way of popular appeal. If your teenage son has become enamored with an Emerging Church while at college, I do not know that this book will interest him or convince him to re-examine his church. That being said, he was not Carson's target audience for Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church. I have little doubt that the majority of the major players leading the Emergent conversation will read and absorb this book. I pray that the Spirit works in their hearts to humble themselves before the Word, that they can test what Carson says in the light of Scripture.<br /><br />My second concern is that Carson does not address in any depth some of the major concerns of believers who examine this movement from the outside. Among these are the mysticism and ecumenism that seem foundational to the Emerging Church.<br /><br />This book is surely the most valuable contribution available to us in challenging the Emerging Church. Carson evaluates the EC in the light of Scripture, showing where it falls far short and providing suggestions for appropriate remedies. This book succeeds in its task and I highly recommend it.argely abandoned the Gospel...I cannot see how their own words constitute anything less than a drift toward abandoning the gospel itself\\" (page 186-187). <br /> <br />The book concludes with a list of relevant Bible passages and \\"A Biblical Meditation on Truth and Experience.\\" He closes with a challenge. \\"So which shall we choose?

Of all the books I've read, both for and against marketing the church, few have been as helpful or as biblical as Selling Out the Church. The authors set out to answer the question of whether the market-drive church can remain Christ's church. While many proponents of church marketing consider this debate to be over, the authors of this book consider it wide open. \\"We hope to enable a more robust debate about the wisdom of employing church marketing by articulating as clearly as we can what we take to be its dangers\\" (page 16). They ask the reader to consider this book \\"a contribution to what we hope is a churchwide conversation about the identity, character, and mission of the church, and more specifically about the wisdom of employing marketing thinking and practices in the service of that church\\" (page 17).<br /><br />Church marketers believe that marketing is a neutral force, in that it shapes only the form of the church while leaving the function alone. Kenneson and Street disagree, for they believe that the convictions that shape marketing are at cross purposes with the convictions of Christians.<br /><br />Following an introduction to the history of marketing, where the reader sees how society has passed through three eras, the production era, the sales era and now the marketing era, the authors answer the church marketers who taught that Jesus and His apostles used marketing to further their ministry in New Testament times. While Jesus used components of marketing, they show that He did not subscribe to a marketing orientation as do the church marketers. In short, they show that there is no biblical basis to support such a marketing orientation. In fact, the marketing orientation is antithetical to Christianity because it presupposes an exchange mindset in which goods or services pass between parties. Yet the Gospel is a message of grace. There is no equal exchange. Instead, God gives us a gift of grace. A marketing mindset may lead us to feel that God has an obligation towards us (in which we exchange service for blessing) or may lead us to seek reciprocity in relationships, despite the biblical emphasis on self-denial.<br /><br />\\"We believe that placing a marketing orientation at the center of the church's life radically alters the shape and character of the Christian faith by redefining the character and mission of the church in terms of manageable exchanges between producers and consumers. Much that is central to the Christian life will not fit neatly into the management/marketing scheme, and, not surprisingly, these matters are neglected in a marketing paradigm.\\" (page 62).<br /><br />The authors go on to examine the false understanding that the church is primarily a service agency that exists to meet the needs of the \\"consumer,\\" believer and unbeliever alike. This view teaches that a felt need is a legitimate need because in a marketing paradigm the customer is always right. At the heart of marketing is an assumption that theology has long denied - that people know what is best for them. Scripture teaches the exact opposite - that the church has something people need, but something these people do not want and do not know they need! The church has no business asking unbelievers (ie consumers) what they would like in a church, for the church already knows their deepest need.<br /><br />A chapter entitled \\"The Baby Boomerang\\" examines the danger of the marketing practices of segmenting, targeting and positioning. While segmenting is a practice that comes naturally to humans, who naturally gravitate towards people like ourselves, we do so along \\"natural\\" lines that are in reality social constructs. We look to the population of a town and divide them along socio-economic lines and assume that God does too. When the church relies on marketing strategies that reach only a certain segment of the population, the church is excused from having to be genuinely transformed to reach the world. We need to change only a little in order to reach people who are just like us, but we need to change radically to reach people who are radically different. \\"The unspoken message of target marketing is that the church need not be different from the world; it simply needs to package itself differently, position itself properly, and enjoy the benefits that come from engaging in mutually beneficial exchanges with its target market\\" (page 93).<br /><br />The authors begin to put all of these concepts together in the sixth chapter. They show that marketers understand that the appeal of the marketing approach is the fixation our society has on control, measurement and effectiveness. Marketing, at its core, is an attempt to control the future. Furthermore, marketing is premised upon the need to move towards the future with limited resources of time, manpower and finances. Yet Christ tells us that in Him we have abundance! We do not need to worry so much about where we are going or how we are going to get there. Rather we need to ensure that we are learning from God along the way as He shapes us into the men and women He wants us to be. Kenneson and Street question where church marketers leave room for God in the grand drama of the church. They also point out the danger in valuing measurable objectives because this tends to filter out theological objectives that cannot be neatly weighed and measured. Thus goals tend to be number-driven even though numbers are not a reliable indicator of theological depth and understanding.<br /><br />The crux of the matter is this. The authors believe that the church is called to be a sign, foretaste and herald of the kingdom. This phrase is repeated often because it stands at odds with the understanding that the church is a service agency. Strangely, if there is a weakness in this book, it is that the authors did not do much to prove that this is the purpose of the church. If a person reads Selling Out the Church who is not convinced of this premise, the book may do little to change his mind.<br /><br />Reading through my review I can see that I have done little to indicate just how thoroughly I enjoyed this book. What can I say, but that of the fifty plus books I have read thus far in 2005, this is one of the top two or three.

US	43519458	R1X9JBKH0U65VR	B0006S2TXW	253773259	The Fallacy Detective: Thirty-six lessons on how to recognize bad reasoning	Books	5	41	46	N	N	Great For Kids or Adults	The Fallacy Detective, written by Hans and Nathaniel Bluedorn, is a book designed for teens or adults that teaches how to spot common errors in reasoning. The goals for this book are clearly laid out in the introduction. When the reader has completed this book he should be able to put a high value on good reasoning, know how to spot many forms of bad reasoning and know how to avoid using many fallacies in his own reasoning.<br /><br />The authors provide a vision of Christian logic in which they appeal to the need for Christians to strive for a higher standard of reasoning, in order to attain greater ability in discernment. Logic is an important foundation for the science of discernment. Thus they seek to define good reasoning in a biblical way. \\"Logic is the science of thinking the way God thinks - the way Jesus taught us to think\\" (page 14).<br /><br />The book contains thirty-six lessons which progress from the most common and basic fallacies, to statistical fallacies and even propaganda. All those terms I have not heard since my university Critical Thinking courses are present as well as some that are commonly used and misused: red herring, ad hominem, tu quoque, appeal to the people, part-to-whole, whole-to-part and so on. Each lesson is followed by several questions which allow the reader to apply what he has just learned. I was glad to see that the questions are cumulative, meaning that what has been taught in previous lessons is continually reviewed in the application questions for subsequent chapters.<br /><br />The authors write in a style that will appeal to teens and young people. The text is interspersed with comics (such as Calvin & Hobbes, Peanunts and Dilbert) and anecdotes. It is also a funny book, as there are many places where the authors turn to humor to make the book enjoyable. A typical lesson may begin similar to this one, which discusses weak analogies: \\"Let's say...you are a budding scientist wanting to write your graduate thesis on the long term effects of Pop-Tarts on humans. The only problem is, you can't find enough people who are willing to eat thirty-four Pop-Tarts a day for one year\\" (page 131).<br /><br />Can learning logic be fun? With The Fallacy Detective it appears that it can be. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve his reasoning skills. While its primary usefulness will be for teenagers, adults will also enjoy it and benefit from the lessons. If you homeschool your children, this may be a useful title. You can read more about it at christianlogic.com.e long term effects of Pop-Tarts on humans.

The Thinking Toolbox is \\"like a toolbox - full of all kinds of tools you can use for different thinking tasks\\" (from the back cover). Like its predecessor, it is self-teaching and is written to appeal to both teenagers and adults.<br /><br />While the format of this book is much the same as The Fallacy Detective, it is in many ways better-written and better-formatted. While the format of the book is much the same, featuring thirty-five lessons, each followed by questions of application, the illustrations were superior and more appealing. It continued to feature the humorous touches that made the previous book such a joy to read, even though it dealt with weighty subject matter.<br /><br />The Thinking Toolbox teaches reasoning skills. It begins with introducing the differences between a discussion, a disagreement, an argument and a fight and guides the reader to understand how to discern premises and conclusions. It progresses to providing tools to understand and deal with opposing viewpoints, before wrapping up with tools for science. These include observation, brainstorming, hyposthesizing, analysis and so on. There are even a few projects and games added to the end of the book to provide further opportunities for application.<br /><br />The only complaint I might have about this book is that the questions following each lesson did not repeat as often or as deliberately as they did in The Fallacy Detective, which provides fewer opportunities for review.<br /><br />This is another helpful title that will no-doubt be helpful in guiding students to use and improve their God-given reasoning abilities. I would suggest that this title has less-appeal to adults than its predessor, but equal appeal to teenagers. It would be a very useful tool for summer-reading or as part of a homeschooling cirriculum. I unreservedly recommend it.commend it.	2005-06-06
US	43519458	RTUHPNF8LKCHD	1581346646	507748086	Hedges: Loving Your Marriage Enough to Protect It	Books	4	59	59	N	N	One of the Best of the Bunch	In the past couple of years I have read several books written for men to address the issue of sexual purity. I have found these books useful to varying degrees. The solutions that authors suggest to deal with this issue - which, as far as I know, is common to all men - vary greatly. Some books forbid men to engage in even a single look at an attractive woman to whom a man is not married. Some books teach a process of \\"bouncing\\" the eyes whereby men learn to avert their gaze from any feminine beauty other than the one to whom they are married. Some teach what is little more than the repetition of mantras - a Bible verse a man can repeat when he sees an attractive woman. Hedges, by Jerry Jenkins, does not fit any of those categories.<br /><br />Jenkins, best known as half of the writing team which brought the world the Left Behind series, is a gifted writer. His book is fun, easy-to-read and will connect with the average man. The book is premised on Paul's admonition to Timothy, found in 2 Timothy 2:22 that he \\"flee youthful lusts.\\" Jenkins tells us that this verse teaches that \\"We are to run. To flee. To get out. To get away\\" (page 45). He believes that God does not give victory over lust in the same way he allows victory over other sins, such as temper, greed and pride. While we can learn to avoid stealing, gossip and lying, he contends that no man will avoid a peek at pornography if he was convinced that no one would find out.<br /><br />And this is where his book varies from the rest of the seventy or eighty titles on the bookstore shelves that share this theme. All the other books (or at least all the ones that I have read) teach that men can gain a victory over this sin. The problem is, that many of them teach technique that in reality tries to convince us that we can win the victory if only we repeat the proper Bible verses and learn to bounce our eyes.<br /><br />Jenkins' solution to sexual temptation is to realize that we cannot avoid being tempted, to learn to appreciate beauty, and to plant hedges around us to guard against sexual sin. He teaches that the first look is not sinful. There is nothing inherently evil in a man looking at a woman and appreciating her beauty. \\"I know that some people may laugh at my notion of looking at women to appreciate God's creativity and would accuse me of inventing a spiritual reason to leer. I maintain that after years of steeling myself to avert my eyes from something made attractive by God, developing an appreciation for it is far healthier. Clearly it would be wrong to gawk and dwell upon some stranger's beauty, especially when I have vowed before God and man to put my wife ahead of all others. Dianna knows that I am attracted to pretty women (she is one, after all). She also knows that I know they are off-limits and that even entertaining a lustful thought is wrong...My gaze doesn't linger and my thoughts stay in check\\" (page 50).<br /><br />Thus the first look, a glance which appreciates a form God made deliberately to appeal to men, is fine. It is the second look, designed to soak in details and provoke lustful thoughts, that is forbidden.<br /><br />Jenkins goes on to suggest the importance of hedges, which are boundaries we put in place to safeguard ourselves from sexual sin. He describes each of the six hedges he has planted in his life, but is careful to point out that each man will have different hedges appropriate to his situation. A man who travels will need to guard himself in ways different than a man who rarely leaves the house. Here are the author's hedges:<br /><br />  1. When he meets, dines or travels with an unrelated woman, he always adds a third person to the group. When this is impossible, he is always the first to tell his wife.<br /><br />  2. He is careful about touching women. He embraces only relatives or close friends, and only in the company of others.<br /><br />  3. If he pays a woman a compliment, it is on clothes or hair, not the woman herself.<br /><br />  4. He avoids flirtation and suggestive conversations, even in jest.<br /><br />  5. He often reminds himself and his wife that he remembers their wedding vows.<br /><br />  6. From the time he gets home to the time the children go to bed, he does no work in order that he might spend quality time with the family.<br /><br />While not a hedge per se, he also promotes the importance of a man sharing his story - the story of how he and his wife met and fell in love. These stories are a powerful reminder of the love a man and wife share and it is important that these stories become a part of the family's heritage.<br /><br />Some will object that this book does not interact with other obvious passages of Scripture. In fact, the book is quite short on Scripture altogether. But I would suggest that Jenkins' purpose in writing this book was not to produce a volume that thoroughly examined all that Scripture teaches on lust and sexual purity. Instead he sought to write a book that teaches men the safeguards that he has found successful in his own life. As such this book is not the whole story when it comes to sexual purity, but it is a good place to begin. Were a man to use the strategies in this book, and only this book, as the foundation for his pursuit of sexual purity, he would miss out on the importance of renewing our minds. Unless our minds are filled with the Word and our heart is filled with the Spirit, our pursuit of purity may just be destined to fail.<br /><br />Planting hedges ought to be a priority in every man's life. As I read this book I realized that while I had never considered the term \\"hedges,\\" I had placed boundaries in my life that work in the same way. For example, shortly after my wife and I were married, I blocked many of the channels on the television that have a lot of inappropriate content or just never have any useful content whatsoever (see ya later, MTV!). I had my wife set a password which I do not know. And even now I still can't watch MTV (or Showcase or a handful of others). And I can just see those who know me laughing as I write this, but I don't hug or touch women (or men, for that matter - no Promise Keepers for me!). I have often been chastised by friends for not hugging enough! Of course this has more to do with an aversion to hugging than it does with sexual purity, but it functions the same.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and can recommend it. It is not the complete story of sexual purity and the author could certainly have gone into far more depth. But the suggestions he provides are valuable to those who desire to live a life of godliness and purity, and to avoid the sin and temptation that our culture provides, promotes and even condones.<br />   4.

He has written several books, the latest of which is A Man of God (which releases today). To provide a clear idea of the target audience for this book, one does not need to look much farther than the list of endorsers. The list includes Roger Staubach, Gary Carter and Pat Summerall. Neil Clark Warren (founder of the online dating site eHarmony.com) is added for good measure. And Chuck Norris enters the fray to write the foreward. And if you still aren't sure, perhaps this quote will bring added clarity. \\"The Christian life is more important than the Super Bowl, the World Series, the NBA Finals, and the Stanley Cup all wrapped together\\" (page 12).<br /><br />This book is obviously intended for the American \\"everyman\\" - the average guy with average interests who attends the average church. Graham intends this book to be a wake-up call. He tells us early-on that he has always firmly believed that \\"if revival was to come to the church, and if the Good News of Jesus Christ was to spread to the nations, it would be because men became godly and began living their faith with passion and integrity\\" (page 13). He seeks to encourage men to step up to the challenges offered to the faith in the twenty-first century and accept responsibility for the church.<br /><br />The book is divided into four roughly-equal sections, each containing three chapters. The first, \\"A Man of God and His Master\\" challenges men to know, understand and commit to God. Graham teaches that men need to commit to maximum discipleship - discipleship that impacts the whole life. The second section, \\"A Man of God and His Integrity\\" challenges men to live upright lives marked by moral purity and free from captivity to temporal possessions. The third section, \\"A Man of God and His Family\\" speaks of the importance of prioritzing family relationships. The final section, \\"A Man of God and His Ministry\\" challenges men about in the areas of mentorship and evangelism.<br /><br />The book is written in a conversational tone and is simple both to read and understand. Stories and examples abound. Scripture examples and proof-texts are also in abundant supply.<br /><br />There were a couple of small theological issues I found with the book, but I can see that these arose because of my Reformed understanding of salvation. On page 201 Graham writes, \\"People are incredibly interested in something that will fill the void in their hearts.\\" While this may be true, in no way does this indicate, as he seems to indicate, that unbelievers are genuinelly and spiritually interested in the gospel. But beyond such minor concerns, I found the book quite Scriptural.<br /><br />I am not convinced that Graham says very much in this book that has not been said before by other authors. In fact, there are probably quite literally one hundred books that deal with this same topic in a similar way. However, judging by the churches of today it seems that plenty of men have still not accepted the challenge, so perhaps this book can serve to wake a few more from their spiritual slumber. If a man in your life is not a reader, and has not already read several similar titles, this may be the type of book that will challenge and motivate him. It is certainly more biblical and more challenging than Wild at Heart and so many others.nal section, \\"A Man of God and His Ministry\\" challenges men about in the areas of mentorship and evangelism. <br /> <br />The book is written in a conversational tone and is simple both to read and understand.

I so enjoyed it that I immediately turned to the sequel, A Journey in Purity which had been sitting beside it all this time. Where the first title in this series of theological novels addresses the doctrines of grace (ie the 5 Points of Calvinism), the second title examines the purity of the church.<br /><br />The story of young pastor Ira Pointer picks up precisely where it left off in the final pages of A Journey in Grace. Ira is faced with a church with a huge membership, but with low attendance. The book describes his struggle in attempting to purify the church by making membership meaningful. He leads the deacons of his congregation through the long process of discovering what the Scriptures teach about church membership, responsibilities and discipline and then leads them through a difficult time of change as the leadership attempts to purify the church. There is plenty of intruige and some fun plot twists that keep the book a novel rather than solely theology.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that A Journey in Purity is better fiction than its predecessor. Richard Belcher is still more a theologian than a story-teller, but this title shows a marked improvement over the first. And as with the first novel, this one presents deep theological truths in a way that is accessible to anyone who enjoys reading a story. I recommend this series.<br /><br />Having finished this book I did a bit of research and found that there are ten more titles in this series and they cover a wide variety of topics. I doubt I will ever read them all, but I do intend to purchase the next two books at some point so I can at least read that far.	2005-05-29

Following a brief trip to the local Christian bookstore I came away with &lt;em>Three&lt;/em> by Ted Dekker. I remembered reading a positive review of this title shortly after it released and thought I would give it a try, despite knowing nothing about the author or the story.<br /><br />&lt;em>Three&lt;/em> has all the elements of your standard psychological/cop thriller novel - a genre I used to read far too often so know quite well. The book moves very quickly and is guaranteed to keep the reader turning the pages. Both my wife and I read and finished it the very day I bought it and we both enjoyed it thoroughly. I hesitate to say much about the plot since almost any information would begin to give away the story, but it all begins with Kevin Parson driving home from seminary only to receive a call on his cell phone telling him there is a bomb in his car and that three minutes from that moment, unless he confesses a sin to the world, the car will blow up. The caller disconnects. And so the game begins. Kevin, his friend and the police try to unravel the mystery about who the caller is and what he wants. What sin could be so serious that a man is willing to kill others to make Kevin confess? Three hundred and fifty pages later, after a heart-pounding surprise ending, you'll wonder how you didn't figure it all out much sooner. It has one of the best conclusions you're likely to read in this type of story.<br /><br />While the book is a great story, it also has a spiritual lesson to teach, though this is not obvious until the final pages and the story could exist without it. It really is a story about the depravity of human beings and the constant struggle between our evil natures and the work of God in our lives. While this message is subtle, it provides some important food for thought, making this just a little bit more than merely a good story.<br /><br />There were a couple of negatives. Some of the characters were clich&eacute; and thus were only semi-plausible. The same held true with certain elements of the plot (I won't say which, as once again, that would provide enough detail to spoil the book). I also found that the author was a little lax with his use of God's name. There were many uses of \\"dear God\\" and \\"oh God\\" type of language that, while it is all too common, ought to make Christians uncomfortable.<br /><br />Keeping those negatives in mind, I can say that I truly enjoyed this book.is just a little bit more than merely a good story. <br /> <br />There were a couple of negatives.

And now I can't help but wish I had read it sooner.<br /><br />I believe the order of the words in \\"theological novel\\" is important. This book is definitely better theology than fiction. In fact, as fiction goes, it is quite poor. But as theology it is exceptional. I chose to read and examine it as theology rather than fiction, since that is clearly its primary purpose.<br /><br />A Journey in Grace tells the story of Ira Pointer, a young man who is studying for the ministry in a fictitious Bible college. While being interviewed for the position of pastor at a nearby church he is asked the question, \\"Young man, are you a Calvinist.\\" The story then unfolds around Ira trying to define and understand Calvinism. Being the methodical sort, he examines Calvinist beliefs point-by-point, holding them up before Scripture to allow the light of the Word to shine through. And he is sure to study not only the points, but also the counter-points. What emerges is a strong defense of the doctrines of grace, that while set in a fictitious setting, is still remarkably instructive. In terms of usefulness as a defense of the doctrines, I would rate it higher than many non-fiction books I have read that cover the same topic.<br /><br />I admit that this book sounds dry. But while it may sound that way, it actually flows quite naturally. It could be that I am biased towards any novel that features a hyper-Calvinist and a convinced Arminian as the antagonists, but I think there is more to it than that.

I rarely turn down a book, so told him I would be glad to read and review this one. He encouraged me to review it honestly and to pan it if I felt that was necessary. He must believe in the old adage that \\"no press is bad press.\\"<br /><br />The Pocket Guide, which is written in a style reminiscent of Douglas Adams' famous five-part trilogy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is a \\"comprehensive guide to the last days, a must-have for apocalypse watchers, readers of Revelation and all-around Armageddon obsessives\\" (from the back cover). To translate, it is a book that pokes fun at those who think they have the end-times all figured out and who like to claim they know when the end is coming. It also seeks to bring just a little bit of clarity to the concepts and terminology surrounding the end-times.<br /><br />Inside you'll find all kinds of interesting information. The book kicks off with an apocalyptionary (let me assure you that Microsoft Word does not have that book in its dictionary) which defines many of the terms one needs to know to undertake a study of eschatology. It includes words like eschatology. To understand the author's writing style, which is clearly meant to appeal to a younger audience, here is an excerpt from his definition of Antichrist. \\"The Antichrist is akin to a devious evil twin of Jesus, in that his hidden agenda is not just the world domination thing but also to oppose Christianity by torturing and destroying all those who refuse to lick his proverbial boots. But not for long, as Jesus also has an agenda - to expose the Antichrist as a fraud, go medieval on his pointy satanic tail during the battle of Armageddon, and reign for a thousand years in his stead. According to dispensationalist theology, the Antichrist is scheduled to appear halfway through the Tribulation. There will be a parade.\\" Later in the book is a chapter that lists and evaluates many of the favored choices of Antichrist among end-times prognosticators such as Nero, the pope, Hitler, Bill Gates, and so on.<br /><br />The heart of the book is two chapters that detail the hundreds of times a person has declared that \\"the end is near.\\" These doomsdayers, ranging from Romulus (founder of Rome) to Martin Luther to Pat Robertson and beyond, have often gathered immense following, but so far their success rate is approximately zero percent. The book wraps up with a discussion of the various eschatological beliefs (where amillennialism seems to fare quite well) and then with a grab-bag of topics that did not rate a chapter of their own. A highlight in this final section is an interview with end-times expert Paul Meier.<br /><br />There were a few times in reading this book where I would laugh out loud, and then catch myself and question if the ends times are really a topic we should make light of. There were other times where I wondered if Boyett had crossed the line between humor and blasphemy. At best I would say there are a few places where he may be towing the line. Another concern (though one unrelated to theology) is that he teaches that the early church leaders were nearly unanimous in their belief in premillenniallism. That is a common belief, but one that is inaccurate as recent studies show that there was a variety of beliefs in the ancient church. And finally, Boyett uses the \\"millions and billions of years ago\\" language that does not sit so well with those of us who believe in a young earth. Beyond those concerns I found this book tremendously enjoyable and I can't deny that I learned quite a bit through reading it.<br /><br />The Pocket Guide is the anti-Left Behind. Boyett writes with humor and insight, and accomplishes what must have been one of his main goals - to show that we just cannot know exactly how or when this world is going to end. Some things are hidden from us, and we need to believe that God has good reason in this. This book will help convince you that we sometimes need to leave well enough alone.elieve that God has good reason in this.

There are few requirements other than a manuscript and money. This is a mixed blessing. On one hand it allows people to publish books who arouse little interest in the handful of major publishers. On the other hand, it allows books to be printed that are sloppily-written, or at times, clearly not deserving of being printed.<br /><br />The Passion of Job by Dr. Richard Spillman is published by Xulon Press, just such a company that caters to the Christian market. In fact, Xulon publicizes the claim (without substantiation) that it is the world's largest Christian publisher. This book is not the type that would gain interest from a major publisher, yet is well-worth reading. Unfortunately, it succumbs to the stylistic sloppiness self-publishing is known for.<br /><br />Dr. Spillman is a professor of computer science and engineering at Pacific Lutheran University - hardly the average job description of the kind of author published by a major publishing company. Through his twenty years of teaching Sunday school at his local church, he gained a deep appreciation for the book of Job. He came to see that his initial impression of the book was wrong. It is not a book, as many think, about God's arbitrary nature in allowing suffering or the story of a God who cannot turn down a bet, but \\"a story about a man who had lost his sense of wonder about God and the lengths that God went to in order to restore Job's awe\\" (page 12). The book is an examination of the theme of God's awesomeness throughout the book of Job, and encouragement to Christians to recover a sense of awe before their Creator.<br /><br />As I read the book I was struck with the parallels between my research and writing and that of Dr. Spillman. It seems to me to be no coincidence that this book arrived as I was writing a series about our tendency to put God in a box and our need to recover a sense of awe before Him.<br /><br />I did, however, have a few concerns with the book. First, I am not entirely convinced of the author's premise that the book centers on Job's need to recover a sense of awe. It seems to me that such a premise may almost undermine the author's intent. However, such a teaching is only very narrowly removed from a more traditional understanding. For example, John MacArthur, in The Bible Handbook, writes that a theme of Job is \\"Job simply commits his ordeal with a devout heart of worship and humility to a sovereign and perfectly wise Creator - and that was what God wanted him to learn in this conflict with Satan\\" (page 145). We could paraphrase MacArthur's statement by saying \\"Job recovered a sense of awe before God - and that was what God wanted him to learn in this conflict with Satan.\\" So perhaps there is not a great difference between the two.<br /><br />Second, as I mentioned earlier, there were some significant issues with sloppiness. There were plenty of spelling and grammatical errors, many of which could have been corrected by a program with only basic spell-checker capabilities (such as Microsoft Word), and all of which could have been caught by an editor.<br /><br />And third, there were a few references to God speaking to the author. Some of this was beautiful, as when he described how the Lord gave him a passage to speak about at His Father's funeral, for this is completely consistent with how the Spirit works. Other references were a little more confusing.<br /><br />In the end, I found the book a tad difficult to analyze. I truly enjoyed it from beginning ton end, and I learned a lot. I suppose the primary problem is my own ignorance when it comes to the deepest meanings of the book of Job. I simply do not know enough about the book to know if Dr. Spillman is right or wrong in his analysis of the text, for I have never done a thorough study of it. However, I still learned much about the importance of having and maintaining an aweof God that is very valuable and precious to me. I recommend this book and hope I can read reviews by others who know more about Job than I do.aining an awe of God that is very valuable and precious to me. I recommend this book and hope I can read reviews by others who know more about Job than I do.	2005-05-29
US	43519458	R2WKRVYG9WEX9P	0972151249	172382027	Running Against the Wind: The Transformation of a New Age Medium and His Warning to the Church	Books	5	27	29	N	N	Story of an Amazing Transformation	Brian Flynn is the founder and director of One Truth Ministries and leads \\"Now Age\\" seminars before churches and groups around the United States. But long before he felt such love and concern for the church, he was a psychic medium who hated Christianity with every fiber of his being. Running Against The Wind is the story of his radical transformation.<br /><br />The book begins as an autobiography. Through the first five chapters Flynn traces his life. He was born into a Roman Catholic family, but one which soon gave up on the Church. When he was a child he developed a fascination with Tarot cards and experimented with Ouija boards - his introduction to the occult. As he grew up, he became increasingly disillusioned with Christianity, soon identifying himself as an agnostic Catholic. He joined the Air Force and his life began to spiral out of control as he dabbled in drugs, Transcendental Meditation and the rock and roll lifestyle. After leaving the Air Force he decided to become a psychic medium and enrolled in a year-long program under the tutelage of a spiritual advisor. He writes about meeting and communing with the spirit guides who helped provide him the information he needed to make accurate assessments during his psychic readings. At this point in his life he was sinking deeper and deeper into the occult.<br /><br />But God saw fit to save Brian from the midst of this occult world. Through a series of events in his life, Brian was radically saved.<br /><br />The day after professing faith in Christ, Flynn did something he had never done before in his life - he rented some pornographic videos. He spent that evening in his apartment getting drunk and watching pornography. The next day he was so hung-over that he called in sick for work, but then rented more pornography and spent another day drinking. All the while his spirit guides were taunting him, telling him how this proved that he was not a Christian. He writes, \\"And then I saw it! The answer came to me in an instant. As if a veil was lifted from my eyes, I saw something I had never seen before. The reason they were resisting me was because they were opposed to Him. They hated Jesus...I realized my guides were opposed to Jesus because they were demonic. They did not want me to become a Christian, because they were not of God. Satan, in his attempt to keep me where I was, revealed who he was! In order to stop me, he had revealed himself to me. He was now exposed.\\" He emerged from this crisis of faith with knowledge of who the lord of the occult and New Age really is.<br /><br />Having been saved from such a lifestyle, imagine the betrayal Flynn felt when he learned that many practices with roots in the occult and New Age had made their way into the church. One particularly foundational moment is when he was teaching a class in his church, warning against the inroads of mysticism, only to learn that across the hall another leader was helping people explore contemplative prayer practices through the teachings of Richard Foster. Flynn was eventually forced by the leadership to leave that church.<br /><br />At this point the biographical portion of the book ceases and the author turns instead to a description and evaluation of various occult and New Age practices. He writes about astrology, yoga, reiki, labyrinths and more. Many of these practices are increasingly accepted in Christian circles. He introduces many of the men and women who have introduced these practices to Christians, focusing particularly on Thomas Merton, Brennan Manning and Richard Foster. He also warns about spiritual directors such as Ruth Haley Barton (until recently a staff member with Willow Creek Community Church) and Tilden Edwards. The book concludes with a chapter entitled \\"New Church on the Horizon\\" where the author expresses concern with Bill Hybels and Willow Creek Church, Rick Warren and Saddleback, and the Emergent Church, each of which is promoting various aspects of Christian mysticism.<br /><br />Running Against The Wind is a valuable contribution to the church's understanding of the inroads of New Age teachings into Christianity. Who better to warn Christians about this than a man who was once committed to these very teachings? Flynn, along with others (A Time of Departing by Ray Yungen, available from the same publisher is an excellent companion volume) have sounded the alarm and shown the very real dangers in allowing occultic, New Age practices to infiltrate Christianity. I pray that the church will heed these warnings.mysticism. <br /> <br />Running Against The Wind is a valuable contribution to the church's understanding of the inroads of New Age teachings into Christianity.

My grandmother, a tiny, sweet, woman, told me about working in an office environment. She mentioned how it used to be that when she approached a door, especially if there were lots of people around, someone would always open and hold the door for her. It was just common courtesy. But by the time she was near retirement, this was no longer the case. Men were intimidated by women and had long since given up acts of chivalry. In fact, the only person she could think of who had held a door for her recently was a young, studded punk rocker with a huge pink mohawk. She blamed this on feminism.<br /><br />She was probably correct in her assessment. The Feminist Mistake, by Mary Kassian traces the rise of feminism through the twentieth century. It shows how a movement at first designed to protect women's rights, soon morphed into a movement of incredibly destructive power - a movement that has ultimately caused great harm to society and to the church. \\"Looking back over the past fifty years is a sobering exercise. Feminism was the dream that promised women happiness and fulfillment. But I suspect ... we would find that women are unhappier and less fulfilled than ever. The feminist paradigm simply does not match the reality of who God created women and men to be. Hence it cannot deliver on its promise\\" (page 299).<br /><br />Kassian traces feminism through three broad stages: naming self, naming the world and naming God. Feminism began as a movement to define and protect the rights of women. Women were naming themselves. As it progressed women demanded the right to name the world, to redefine much more than their own roles. And in the final stage, women have demanded the right to redefine God within the framework of their feminist philosophy.<br /><br />The book seems to have three goals. The first is to trace feminism through modern history. As someone who has always been fascinated by history and who studied it through college, this had great appeal and I found it very interesting. It was particularly fascinating to see the movement stray farther and farther away from the biblical and societal norms.<br /><br />The second goal is to prove that Christian feminism and secular feminism are really no different. Kassian shows that what is radical in one generation is mainstream in the next, and then works its way into the church shortly thereafter. At this point in history, feminism has gone mainstream so that most women are feminists without being aware of it. And this includes Christian feminists. The author writes, for example, that in the evangelical church, \\"the biblical pattern of complementarity is no longer the standard. Whereas in the past, complementarity could generally be \\"caught,\\" the new cultural milieu dictates that it must now be \\"taught.\\" The default belief of the average churchgoer has changed\\" (page 288). Christian feminism, at its heart is pluralistic, ecumenical, anti-authority and pro-deviance. The chapter about feminist hermeneutics was startling; showing how feminists hold nothing sacred in their desire to oust any theology they feel contradicts their feminist presuppositions.<br /><br />Finally, Kassian suggests what the church needs to do and to recover in order to guard against feminism. Unfortunately this constitutes the shortest section in the book, which is a pity since what is there is fascinating.<br /><br />Kassian concludes that \\"Feminism has failed miserably, and ironically it has exacerbated the very problem it set out to resolve. Instead of promoting a healthy self-identity for women or contributing to the greater harmony between the sexes, it has resulted in increased gender confusion, increased conflict, and a profound destruction of morality and family\\" (page 299). Those are strong words, but they are well-proven. While it is simple enough to trace the history of feminism, it is far more difficult to see how what has been lost can be reclaimed. But the book ends optimistically, calling for a new generation to embrace the Gospel and to take God at His word.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to embark on what is sometimes a difficult read. To truly understand feminism, it is necessary to see it in its historical context both within and outside of the church. Having defined and having come to a greater understanding of it, we will be equipped to guard against it.n lost can be reclaimed.

We know from Scripture that there is a constant spiritual battle being fought in this world, with human beings the bounty. We know that there is more to the world than what we can see - that angels and demons are real and are present. We do not clearly understand how they operate or even where they are, yet they exist. The Light That Was Dark brings home the importance of being aware of this spiritual conflict and guarding ourselves against ignoring it.<br /><br />Warren Smith is a social worker and author who was formerly involved in the New Age movement. This book chronicles his journey from the New Age to his conversion to Christianity. Smith's journey to the occult began with a psychic reading which convinced him that he was spiritually underdeveloped. He agreed with this assessment and resolved to remedy this. He began to search for something to fill this void. He tells of sitting on his rooftop one evening and calling out to heavens \\"All you on the other side, I want your help in my life. I want to become more spiritual, I want to grow\\" (page 22). The spirits seemed to answer him. Through a series of \\"coincidences\\" he became a dedicated follower of Indian master Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, a guide who led him deeply into eastern religion and meditation. Rajneesh seemed to have a supernatural hold on Smith and on his other followers.<br /><br />Despite that hold, Smith eventually grew tired of Rajneesh and began to investigate other leaders. Soon he was studying A Course in Miracles and dabbling in other occult and New Age practices, even resolving to become a channel for \\"The Source.\\" But the further he progressed in his spiritual development, the more he began to experience shocking spiritual oppression. The stories of being attacked in the night by spirits, spirits he could not see, but could feel - spirits that would suck the very energy out of him or his wife - are chilling and haunting. The spiritual realm quickly became real to the author.<br /><br />But one day, in the Metaphysical section of a bookstore of all places, he found a copy of The Beautiful Side of Evil by Johanna Michaelsen, an author, speaker and former New Ager who had become a Christian. This author's biography was very similar to that of Smith's wife, and so he spent several hours studying the book. Within those pages he learned what the Bible says about rebuking demons and the forces of darkness. The next time he was oppressed, he cried out to Jesus and immediately the evil departed. This proved true time and again. Smith began to see that the beauty of the New Age was false and that there were dark, demonic forces involved. He came to understand the truth of Scripture and he and his wife were saved by the power of Jesus Christ. They came to faith not through church leadership or programs of evangelism, but by diligent study of the Scriptures.<br /><br />The book concludes with two pages that outline the author's concern with the inroads the New Age is making into Christianity. This has been further detailed in his book Deceived on Purpose which I have reviewed here and highly recommend.<br /><br />The Light That Was Dark is an important book and one I hope will be read by many Christians. Smith shows beyond any doubt that the New Age, or New Spirituality, is inexorably linked with the occult. Yet this occultic movement is making surprising inroads into Christianity. The lines between Christianity and the New Spirituality are becoming increasingly blurred.

I did not finish this book. I believe it is only the second book, of the 100+ I have reviewed, that I did not complete. I read the first several chapters and was so disgusted by what I was reading that I elected to merely skim the remainder of the book. After all, I'm a busy guy and have an entire shelf of unread books awaiting my attention. Why would I want to waste my time on what is, unfortunately, complete trash?<br /><br />Escaping The Matrix by Gregory Boyd and Al Larson is, according to the cover, a guide to \\"setting your mind free to experience real life in Christ.\\" The reality is that unless Christ requires that we use the latest in pseudo-occult psychological techniques to free our minds, this book will do nothing of the sort. Indeed it cannot, because much of the teaching of this book directly contradicts the Scripture.<br /><br />The first clue to the trouble within this book came only two pages in, where the authors explained that the key to living a life freed from the chains of the past is to be found in The Matrix movies. In fact, the majority of the book is structured around the themes of the movies, and the authors are as likely to proof-text their teachings with quotes from The Matrix as they are from the Bible. The reader is even treated to a quote from one of the movies at the beginning of each chapter.<br /><br />Instead of providing a detailed review (something I have disqualified myself from doing, since I merely skimmed much of the book) I thought I would provide an overview of the authors' technique for \\"setting faith for the true you.\\" That should speak volumes in and of itself.<br /><br />Escaping The Matrix culminates in an exercise that is designed to \\"help you collapse the negative Matrix-oriented faith that you are currently doing and install a biblically grounded faith about God's will for your life.\\" There are seven steps:<br /><br />  1. Form a mental picture that re-presents you doing an emotion, attitude or behavior that you believe needs to be changed in your life. Once you have it, set it aside and perform a pattern interrupt.<br /><br />  2. Ask God to give you a picture of what you would look like if you manifested the truth of who you are in Christ. Take a snapshot of this you and enjoy the photograph.<br /><br />  3. Delete all background elements of your future picture and change it to be made out of diamond. Place the negative picture in front of the positive picture so you can see the negative through the positive.<br /><br />  4. See Jesus' hands grasping the positive picture and smashing it through the negative. Hear and see it burst ito pieces and fall to the ground.<br /><br />  5. Now see Jesus and you sweep up the broken glass. Dump the pieces into a wastebasket and see and hear Jesus congratulate you for getting rid of a Matrix lie.<br /><br />  6. Gaze on the positive picture and make it bigger and brighter. With your internal voice, say to your soul that you and the Holy Spirit together will make thie positive picture happen.<br /><br />  7. Ask God for His wisdom to help you discern things in your life that need to be altered to ensure the true you is manifested.<br /><br />I suppose we are supposed to set aside our reason and believe that this is biblical methodology. Strangely, however, I can find no examples such in Scripture. And what's more, I know of no examples in all of church history. It seems Larson and Boyd have stumbled onto some critical knowledge that has been hidden from us until discovered by the Wachowski brothers and digitized into a series of sex-and-swearingf-filled R-rated movies. The Lord truly must work in mysterious ways for this to be true.<br /><br />But instead of ranting and raving about this, I thought it would be more profitable to direct you to a much more helpful, educated review. Regardless of whether or not you intend to read this book, I would encourage you to read Dr. Mike's Review at Eternal Perspectives (doa Google search). Mike uses great words like neuropsychology, experiential psychotherapy, and soteriology and suggests that \\"this book is the latest of a seemingly unending chain of psychologically- and psychotherapeutically-informed attempts to facilitate sanctification. Some of the points made are true and valuable; at the same time, it commits some serious, prevalent errors concerning the nature of salvation and sanctification in the Christian life.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, I recommend this book only as kindling.

The Trinity is a difficult doctrine to understand - impossible even. The eternal nature of God - that is another difficult or impossible one. But the love of God? I wouldn't have believed it. But having read this book I believe it now.<br /><br />The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God by D.A. Carson is just a short book (96 pages) that is drawn from four lectures Carson delivered in 1998. There was a small amount of editing performed, but the conversational nature of the speech carries through the text. It makes for an easy read, despite some deep theology.<br /><br />Carson begins by outlining five reasons why this is a difficult doctrine. First, he suggests that while most people believe that God is a loving Being, this belief is set within a foundation other than Scripture. Second, many complementary truths about God are disbelieved by many within our culture (and our churches). Third, postmodernism reinforces a sentimental, syncretistic and pluralistic view of God. Fourth, the church has fallen into believing a sentimentalized version of God's love that is not consistent with God as presented in Scripture. And fifth, the church portrays this as a simple doctrine and overlooks certain important distinctions that prove this to be a difficult doctrine.<br /><br />From this foundation, Carson builds the book around four themes: the distortion of the love of God; the fact that God is love; God's love and God's sovereignty; and God's love and God's wrath. As we would expect from Carson, he goes straight to the source - to God's revelation of Himself in Scripture - to correct false assumptions and provide a deep discussion of what God's love entails. He defends the compatibility of seemingly-opposite characteristics of God (that God can be perfectly loving and yet perfectly just in His wrath) and examines how God's love interacts with His sovereignty in human affairs.<br /><br />The only caveat I would provide with this book is that it does assume some knowledge of Christian theology since it was initially targeted at seminary students. For example, Carson discusses distinctions between Calvinism and Arminianism without first defining his terms. A basic knowledge of Greek would not hurt either, though it certainly is not necessary.<br /><br />It is rare to find so much depth in such a short book. At the same time it is also nice to be able to learn so much without having to wade through hundreds of pages of text - this book could as easily have been hundreds or thousands of pages long. Carson does a wonderful job of highlighting the most important issues while confining himself to a limited word count. I highly recommend this book.. <br /> <br />The only caveat I would provide with this book is that it does assume some knowledge of Christian theology since it was initially targeted at seminary students.

If a reformation is to come to the church, it must be preceded by a reformation of the pulpit. As the pulpit goes, so goes the church\\" (page 17). What follows is four chapters which are, appropriately, expository in nature and which examine the priority, power, pattern and passion of expository preaching.<br /><br />The book is divided into four sections. In the first, the author writes about the priority of biblical preaching, using verses from Acts 2 as his text. He teaches that God's church must be done in God's way in order to thrive and survive in the way the Lord intends. He then goes on to show the priority Jesus and his apostles placed on biblical preaching. The second chapter examines the power of biblical preaching, and examines Jonah and his preaching to the city of Nineveh. He teaches that solid preaching needs to be courageous, compelling, confrontational and compassionate in order to conform to the biblical model. The third chapter, which examines the pattern of biblical preaching, looks back to Ezra as he read and explained the Law to the people of Jerusalem. Lawson writes about the necessary preparation for delivering an expository message and provides a call to preachers to become true teachers of the Word. The final chapter looks at Paul's words to Timothy found in 1 Timothy 4:13-16 and speaks of the passion of biblical preaching. The author shows the pattern of reading, applying and teaching the Word and also speaks of the importance of perseverance in the ministry.<br /><br />The book is laced with effective illustrations, and even better, with multitudes of wonderful quotes about preaching. A personal favorite is found on page 64. \\"Unfortunately much of contemporary preaching seems out of balance, having become too much like what someone described as 'a mild mannered man standing before mild-mannered people urging them to become more mild-mannered.'\\" It is followed by words spoken by Philips Brokks. \\"If you are afraid of men and a slave to their opinion, go and do something else.

US	43519458	R3SADGW9PMOXPI	0785263705	407388798	Blue Like Jazz: Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality	Books	2	224	281	N	N	Postmodern Take on Christianity	I can't deny that was a little apprehensive about this book before I began it, even though I had not read any detailed reviews and had little idea of the content. Just a few days before I began reading I had seem an interview with the author, Donald Miller, in \\"The Door Magazine\\" in which he had been terribly sarcastic and quite crude (judging by the number of words that had to be \\"blanked\\" out). It left me with an impression of the author that was not altogether favorable.<br /><br />Despite my misgivings, I found that I enjoyed this book more than I thought I might. That is not to say it is without its problems, and without some serious problems at that. But I enjoyed the rambling, conversational tone of the book, even if it is a little difficult to follow at times. In fact, there are times where it is downright irritating as the author launches into tirades about Republicans or traditional Christianity. He subtly applauds Bill Clinton while denigrating George Bush. He sneers at traditional churches, but affirms his enjoyment of the Catholic Mass and the Greek Orthodox Church. And all the while he makes self-deprecating comments and expresses himself in words that are generally considered inappropriate for a Christian book (\\"kick in the butt,\\" \\"pissed-off,\\" \\"crap,\\" etc).<br /><br />So what did I like about the book? Blue Like Jazz is built around a sound premise - that the Christian faith continues to be relevant even in a postmodern culture. Miller writes, \\"I don't think any church has ever been relevant to culture, to the human struggle, unless it believed in Jesus and the power of His gospel\\" (page 111). I agree entirely that the church can only be relevant to the culture if it maintains the centrality of the gospel and remains unashamed of that simple message. Unfortunately that gospel message becomes somewhat blurred in this book. \\"[The central message of Christ] is that man sinned against God and God gave the world over to man, and that if somebody wanted to be rescued out of that, if somebody for instance finds it all very empty, that Christ will rescue them if they want...\\" (page 124). The Bible, however, teaches that no person wants to be rescued. God needs to begin a prior work in order to draw people to Himself. Miller, on the other hand, teaches that there is something within us that draws God to us. \\"I realized, after reading those Gospels, that Jesus didn't just love me out of principle; He didn't just love me because it was the right thing to do. Rather, there was something inside me that caused Him to love me\\" (page 238). When we acknowledge that there is something inside of us that draws God to us, we deny that it is His grace alone that saves us, for grace is, by definition, unmerited favor. There is nothing in us that makes us worthy of God. He loves us because of something inside of Himself, not inside of us.<br /><br />I also enjoyed other aspects of the book. The reverse confession booth makes for great reading, as do many of Miller's other stories. Despite some poor theology, he gave me a lot to think about, especially in regards to taking theology beyond the doors of the church and really turning it into practice.<br /><br />I believe, though, that the great failing of this book is the author's belief that Christianity is a feeling, and is not something that can be rationally explained or understood. Early in the book, on page 54, Miller writes that God does not make any sense. Just a few pages later he writes that Christian Spirituality is something that cannot be explained, but is something that can only be felt. \\"It cannot be explained, and yet it is beautiful and true. It is something you feel, and it comes from the soul\\" (page 57). Later he writes, \\"At the end of the day, when I am lying in bed and I know the chances of any of our theology being exactly right are a million to one, I need to know that God has things figured out, that if my math is wrong we are still going to be okay. And wonder isthat feeling we get when we let go of our silly answers, our mapped out rules that we want God to follow. I don't think there is any better worship than wonder\\" (page 206).<br /><br />This irrational, feelings-based approach to Christianity is consistent with postmodern thought, where experience rather than an objective standard is the arbiter of truth. Miller rarely returns to the Scripture, and instead opts to explain his beliefs through the lens of his own experience. He seems to trust in experience instead of having a rational faith in a rational God who is truly sovereign. In fact, I do not recall any specific references from the Scripture - an oddity considering that the book claims to be thoughts on Christian Spirituality. But perhaps \\"nonreligious\\" thoughts preclude the use of Scripture proof-texting.<br /><br />It is strange, that having come to the end of this review I am far less enthusiastic about the book than I was in reading it and in reflecting on it afterwards. While I can say that I did receive some benefit from reading it, I would be hesitant to recommend it to others. There is some value to be found, but one has to dig deep beneath layers of rambling untruth and poor theology to find them. There are many other books that contain far more treasure than this.onder is that feeling we get when we let go of our silly answers, our mapped out rules that we want God to follow.

The \\"worship wars\\" that have plagued the modern church are a prime example of this. Many churches have fallen apart and many Christians have been deeply hurt over styles of music. Churches that have sought to be progressive and contemporary have often done away with hymns, throwing away hundreds of years of Christian tradition in the process. Other churches have refused to sing any song written in modern times, indicating an irrational bias towards days gone by. In the process worship has come to be nearly synonymous with music. Church services are often structured around a time of worship, led by a worship pastor, and this is followed by a time of apparently non-worshipful teaching led by a teaching pastor.<br /><br />These worship wars are a terrible distraction, for as believers who have access to the New Testament we know that worship extends far beyond music. Worship is to encompass all of life rather than only select parts. Worship by the Book is an attempt by four men, D.A Carson, Mark Ashton, Kent Hughes and Timothy Keller, to unravel the meaning of worship as well as to suggest ways that corporate worship, done as the church gathers together, can be most meaningful and most faithful to Scripture.<br /><br />The book begins with an essay by Carson entitled \\"Worship Under the Word\\" in which he builds a framework around which each of the other authors will write. The heart of the essay is a lengthy definition of worship and a twelve-point examination of this definition. It is an unusually long and detailed definition of worship, yet one that for precisely those reasons is exceedingly useful.<br /><br />Following Carson's introduction, each of the three co-authors is given one chapter to provide insight about worship within their tradition. The first of these is Mark Ashton, who is vicar of the Round Church at St. Andrew the Great in Cambridge, England. His essay is entitled \\"Following in Cramner's Footsteps\\" and he proposes that the Anglican Church recover the principles Cramner used to draft the Book of Common Prayer. He suggests each aspect of a worship service needs to meet three criteria: is it biblical, is it accessible and is it balanced? Despite coming from a tradition that seems far removed from mainline evangelicalism, I suspect the bulk of believers with agree with most of what he writes, at least until the final paragraphs where he writes about infant baptism and presumptive regeneration. I was a little bit concerned about a vague, underlying spirit of pragmatism that seemed to lie under the surface of some of what he wrote. Within the sample services, for example, is an outline of a guest service in which they have dumbed-down their Bible translation, opting for the Good News Bible in place of the New International Version. Despite this, there was much within his essay that was of practical value.<br /><br />The second essay was written by Kent Hughes, pastor of the College Church in Wheaton, Illinois. At the heart of Hughes' essay, \\"Free Church Worship,\\" were his six distinctives of Christian worship: it is God-centered, Christ-centered, Word-centered, consecration, whole-hearted and reverent. I especially appreciated his emphasis on reverence, as this is sorely-lacking in many contemporary churches. He closed with some useful thoughts on music in corporate worship.<br /><br />The final essay was written by Timothy Keller, pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church (PCA) in New York City. Keller is seen as a trend-setter within the Presbyterian Church of America, so I looked forward to his essay which was entitled \\"Reformed Worship in the Global City.\\" Keller contrasted and compared contemporary worship and historical worship and proposed a middle-ground, but not one as simple as an even distribution of elements from each. His essay was built around an examination and defense of the Reformed worship tradition. He examined its variety, sources, balance, core, traits and tests. I particularly enjoyed his explanation of the service structure at their church and the cycles of praise, renewal and commitment.<br /><br />While it was generally a strong essay, it seemed to come apart a little at the end. The author wrote about the importance of including unbelieving musicians in the worship team as a way to evangelize them, arguing that God's common grace given to musicians brings as much glory to Him as do believers using their talents in His service. I much preferred Kent Hughes' take on this same issue. In the previous chapter he wrote \\"Musicians must see themselves as fellow laborers in the Word and must lead with understanding and an engaged heart. Those who minister in worship services must be healthy Christians who have confessed their sins and by God's grace are living their lives consistently with the music they lead. The sobering fact is that over time the congregation tends to become like those who lead.\\" I was also a bit disappointed by the content of the bulletin inserts of Redeemer Church that were included within this essay as they seemed to favorably quote Mother Teresa, writing that the most important need of the poor is to be wanted.<br /><br />Despite a few small missteps, I found this book fascinating and convicting. I would encourage any pastor or worship leader to buy this book and to read it through at least a couple of times. It will provide valuable insight into planning worship services that will lead believers into a time of worship that goes far beyond the music. Worship like these men describe is becoming increasingly rare. I hope this volume can help many churches recover worship that is done by the Book.tradition.

US	43519458	R174MUN6THZG50	0310210747	36906356	The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here For?	Books	2	2	4	N	N	What's All The Controversy About?	There are many reviews here which summarize much of what I discovered about this book, so I will summarize some of my greatest concerns. Even if you are one of the many who has thoroughly enjoyed this book and perhaps find it has changed your life, I'd encourage you to keep reading.<br />Thesis<br />Page 25 seems to summarize the thesis of the book. It says &quot;We discover that meaning and purpose only when we make God the reference point of our lives.&quot; This seems to say that if the reader finds God he will also find himself and his purpose. This is not the gospel!<br />Multiple translations<br />Rick Warren quotes the Bible over 1,200 times in the text of The Purpose Driven Life. To do so, he uses fifteen different translations and paraphrases. Appendix 3 contains his rationale for this and he provides two reasons for the number of translations. The first is that in any single translation &quot;nuances and shades of meaning can be missed, so it is always helpful to compare translations.&quot; The second is &quot;the fact that we often miss the full impact of familiar Bible verses, not because of poor translating, but simply because they have become so familiar.&quot; He believes this will &quot;help you see God's truth in new, fresh ways.&quot;<br />The author's logic is faulty as the two reasons he provides contradict each other. If a translation introduces something in a new and fresh way it will necessarily introduce new nuances and shades of meaning. The way to remove nuances and shades of meaning is to use as literal a translation as possible so that the words are God's alone and are not interpreted by the translator. The author can then exposit the text, clarifying what might require clarification. This is nothing more than the traditional means of teaching what the Bible says.<br />Audience<br />The author aims this book at two distinct audiences - believers and unbelievers. He shows that he is, initially at least, writing for unbelievers by invitingthem to pray a short prayer, asking them to say &quot;Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you.&quot; He then welcomes them to the family of God. I fear, though, that he uses too many Christian terms and phrases to really connect with unbelievers. Similarly, if he is hoping to reach new Christians, I think the same holds true - the &quot;Christianese&quot; terms and many of the Biblical references may alienate them. On the other hand, if he is hoping to reach mature Christians, much of the book will be too simplistic for them.<br />We know from the Bible that there is a vast difference between believers and unbelievers. Those who have come to a saving knowledge of Christ have had their very natures changed. They have become adopted children of God and have become heirs to His promises. They have special privileges and they have knowledge and faith that unbelievers do not. This is not to say that a book can or should not be written that attempts to reach both audiences. What it does mean is that an author must be sure to distinguish between audiences, being careful not to mislead either audience.<br />Warren often fails to differentiate between audiences. For example, in the second chapter he quotes Ephesians 1:4 which reads &quot;just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.&quot; The context of this verse shows that the author is referring to only Christians, yet Warren makes no distinction.<br />The Gospel<br />The author does not at any time provide a clear explanation of the gospel message. On page 58 he says, &quot;Real life begins by committing yourself completely to Jesus Christ&quot; but never comes closer than that. He never writes about such crucial doctrines as man's sinfulness and need for a Savior or the work of Jesus. He never mentions the importance Christ's life, the cross or the empty tomb. Yet on page 58 we find him leading the prayer of &quot;Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you&quot; and then saying &quot;Welcome to the family of God!&quot; How can a person become a Christian without any understanding of his own sinfulness or of Christ's sacrifice on our behalf?<br />Warren's gospel seems to be one of purpose. He teaches that man's greatest problem is purposelessness and this book will remedy that situation by helping the reader discover his purpose. Needless to say, this is not the gospel as taught by the Bible. The Bible teaches that man's greatest problem is that he is a sinner and is alienated from God. Purposelessness is insignificant compared to the possibility of an eternity in hell.<br />Life Application<br />The aim studying the Bible is application. We are to study the Bible so we can apply what we learn to our lives, with the ultimate aim of conforming ourselves to the image of Christ. Application, though, depends on proper teaching and sound knowledge. It stands to reason that a person cannot apply to his life something he does not understand. Teaching stands as the foundation that application is built upon.<BR>Since Warren does not explain the gospel and the real means of salvation, how can people truly apply what he teaches? If everything is application, what do they really believe in?<br />Bible Use<br />We have already seen how the author has used multiple translations as well as his justification for doing so. Of even greater concern is his carelessness in his use of the Bible. He continually removes Scripture passages from their proper context in order to make them suit his purposes. He carelessly applies promises to the reader that clearly do not apply. He also distorts or changes the meanings of certain passages to make them say what he wants them to say. This is well-documented in other reviews on this site.<br />I can recommend this book only to discerning readers. There is certainly some value in the book, but in my opinion the bad outweighs the good. I would certainly not use this as an introduction to Christianity or as a means of reaching unbelievers.	2005-04-22

After all, each book should be taken on its own merits. It is not entirely fair to cast presuppositions gained from previous books onto an author's later works. It is not unusual for an author to come to better or worse understandings as his life progresses. A person whose theology once seemed rock-solid, could, unfortunately, write a book later in life that seemed to be anything but orthodox. I say this to preface my review to John Eldredge's latest book, Captivating. I attempted to be as objective as possible when reading the book, but found it to be nearly impossible. The book was clearly designed to ride the wave of Eldredge's previous success, and most notably his best-seller Wild at Heart. Wild at Heart is mentioned on the front cover (\\"Best-Selling Author of Wild at Heart\\") and the back (\\"What Wild at Heart did for men Captivating will do for you\\"). It was mentioned again in the second sentence of the introduction and was often quoted, even at length, throughout the book (as was The Sacred Romance). There is even an 8-page excerpt of it at the back of the book. While this may provide credibility to those who enjoyed the first book, I found that it cast a shadow over Captivating.<br /><br />John Eldredge has gained prominence within Christian circles as a leading author who addresses issues of concern to men. He has written several best-selling books. Wild at Heart, the most popular of these, is also the most controversial. There have been extensive reviews and examinations of the book and many have expressed concern that it contains consistently poor theology. Captivating marks a new stage in Eldredge's ministry, as it is written specifically for women. The back cover tells us that \\"What Wild at Heart did for men Captivating will do for you.\\" It promises to \\"unveil the mystery of a woman's soul.\\" This book is co-written by Eldredge's wife, Stasi, and represents her first publication.<br /><br />I have little doubt that in a short while we will have many detailed, critical analyses of this book available to us - reviews that will be far more detailed and insightful than any I could write. I do not intend to write an extensive review, primarily because of the subject matter. I could address the theology of the book, but would have no comparison to the subject matter. After all, I do not read many books geared specifically for women. Perhaps I should. Regardless, this book is so closely tied to Wild at Heart that many of the criticisms levelled at that book will apply also to this one. In Fool's Gold, edited by John MacArthur, Daniel Gillespie writes a lengthy critique of the book and levels four main charges at it, saying it has an insufficient view of Scripture, an inadequate picture of God, an incomplete portrait of Christ and an innacurate picture of man. Those all apply to Captivating as much as they did to Wild at Heart.<br /><br />Like Wild at Heart, this book is built around three premises. Every woman wants to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventures and to display beauty. The book is roughly divided along these lines. \\"The longings God has written deep in your heart are telling you something essential about what it means to be a woman, and the life he meant for you to live. Now we know - many of those desires have gone unmet, or been assaulted, or simply so long neglected, that most women end up living two lives. On the surfce we are busy and efficient, professional, even. We are getting by. On the inside women lose themselves in a fantasy world or in cheap novels, or we give ourselves over to food or some other addiction to name the ache of our hearts. But your desire is still there, crying out to be set free, to find the life your desires tell you of. You can find that life - if you are willing to embark on a great adventure\\" (page 19). The adventure is written on the pages of this book.<br /><br />In place of an overall critique, allow me to express a few of my concerns with this book:<br /><br />  * As with Eldredge's previous books, this one relies heavily on stories and, in particular, movies to express teaching. I counted the movies and arrived at a list of thirty-eight that are mentioned either implicitly or explicitly. Many of them are mentioned multiple times. There were also many references to novels and songs. While there were also numerous references to the Scripture, these were most often drawn from only a few passages and were often used outside of their proper context.<br /><br />  * I was surprised to see that the book paid scant attention to those passages of the Bible that particularly address women. I do not recall any attempt to interact with Paul's epistles; Proverbs 31 received only one mention, and it was only in the context of sneering at the church's fixation with that traditional role model. In fact, the only passages that received any significant attention were Genesis 2 and 3. The authors rewrote Genesis 2:18, which most translations render similar to \\"It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.\\" They turned to a commentary and translation written by Robert Alter and suggested a better translation of the verse is \\"I will make a sustainer beside him\\" (page 27). Strangely, though, they later seem to indicate that a man does have some sort of authority over his wife.<br /><br />  * Eldredge's emphasis on extra-biblical revelation has carried over from his other books. In this one, for example, he writes aout a time when the Holy Spirit told him to buy an Emmylou Harris CD for his wife (page 120). He also indicates that the Spirit will tell us when we need a bubblebath, a movie or a run (page 145), if only we listen to Him.<br /><br />  * Eldredge rehashes the worst of The Sacred Romance, drawing extensively from Hosea and Song of Solomon and using sexual terminology. He says that God has a deep, fiery, passionate love for women and that He wishes to romance us. \\"Think of one of the most romantic scenes you can remember, scenes that made you sigh. Jack with Rose on the bow of the Titanic, his arms around her waist, their first kiss. Wallace speaking in French to Murron, then in Italian: \\"Not as beautiful as you.\\" Aragorn, standing with Arwen in the moonlight on the bridge in Rivendell, declaring his love for her. Edward returning for Elinor in Sense and Sensibility, and professor Behr returning for Jo at the end of Little Women. Now, put yourself in the scene as the Beauty, and Jesus as the Lover\\" (page 114). This clearly goes far beyond the biblical metaphors for God's love.<br /><br />  * The authors tell us that the women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus are mentioned because of their vulnerability (page 155). The ridiculous teaching about Ruth, first printed in Wild at Heart is repeated here.<br /><br />  * Ironically, while God is presented as a wild Romancer, He is also presented in an emasculated form. We are told that God has been wooing you. We are told that \\"you are meant to fill a place in the heart of God no one and nothing else can fill. He longs for you\\" (page 120). This almost seems to indicate that God needs us to make His joy and satisfaction complete. There are often several references to our need to minister to the heart of Jesus through our worship. All of this portrays an inaccurate understanding of God.<br /><br />  * There is a strange emphasis on spiritual warfare. Stasi writes about dizzy spells which she felt were caused by Satan. There are multiple references to binding Satan and casting him and his minions away.<br /><br />For sake of brevity I will cease. While some of these are only minor concerns, others are clearly more significant. Overall, this book is little more than Wild at Heart rewritten for women - with a soft, feminine cover in place of the harsh, masculine one. Like its predecessor it contains far too much poor theology and draws as much frompopular culture as it does from the Word of God. While there was some benefit for me in reading about the hearts of women, there must be better resources available that would do this in a more biblical manner. Despite the risk of stating the obvious, I would caution Christians against reading this book.women and that He wishes to romance us. \\"Think of one of the most romantic scenes you can remember, scenes that made you sigh.

While there was some benefit for me in reading about the hearts of women, there must be better resources available that would do this in a more biblical manner. Despite the risk of stating the obvious, I would caution Christians against reading this book.	2005-04-22

There are many reviews here which summarize much of what I discovered about this book, so I will summarize some of my greatest concerns. Even if you are one of the many who has thoroughly enjoyed this book and perhaps find it has changed your life, I'd encourage you to keep reading.<br />Thesis<br />Page 25 seems to summarize the thesis of the book. It says &quot;We discover that meaning and purpose only when we make God the reference point of our lives.&quot; This seems to say that if the reader finds God he will also find himself and his purpose. This is not the gospel!<br />Multiple translations<br />Rick Warren quotes the Bible over 1,200 times in the text of The Purpose Driven Life. To do so, he uses fifteen different translations and paraphrases. Appendix 3 contains his rationale for this and he provides two reasons for the number of translations. The first is that in any single translation &quot;nuances and shades of meaning can be missed, so it is always helpful to compare translations.&quot; The second is &quot;the fact that we often miss the full impact of familiar Bible verses, not because of poor translating, but simply because they have become so familiar.&quot; He believes this will &quot;help you see God's truth in new, fresh ways.&quot;<br />The author's logic is faulty as the two reasons he provides contradict each other. If a translation introduces something in a new and fresh way it will necessarily introduce new nuances and shades of meaning. The way to remove nuances and shades of meaning is to use as literal a translation as possible so that the words are God's alone and are not interpreted by the translator. The author can then exposit the text, clarifying what might require clarification. This is nothing more than the traditional means of teaching what the Bible says.<br />Audience<br />The author aims this book at two distinct audiences - believers and unbelievers. He shows that he is, initially at least, writing for unbelievers by inviting them to pray a short prayer, asking them to say &quot;Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you.&quot; He then welcomes them to the family of God. I fear, though, that he uses too many Christian terms and phrases to really connect with unbelievers. Similarly, if he is hoping to reach new Christians, I think the same holds true - the &quot;Christianese&quot; terms and many of the Biblical references may alienate them. On the other hand, if he is hoping to reach mature Christians, much of the book will be too simplistic for them.<br />We know from the Bible that there is a vast difference between believers and unbelievers. Those who have come to a saving knowledge of Christ have had their very natures changed. They have become adopted children of God and have become heirs to His promises. They have special privileges and they have knowledge and faith that unbelievers do not. This is not to say that a book can or should not be written that attempts to reach both audiences. What it does mean is that an author must be sure to distinguish between audiences, being careful not to mislead either audience.<br />Warren often fails to differentiate between audiences. For example, in the second chapter he quotes Ephesians 1:4 which reads &quot;just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.&quot; The context of this verse shows that the author is referring to only Christians, yet Warren makes no distinction.<br />The Gospel<br />The author does not at any time provide a clear explanation of the gospel message. On page 58 he says, &quot;Real life begins by committing yourself completely to Jesus Christ&quot; but never comes closer than that. He never writes about such crucial doctrines as man's sinfulness and need for a Savior or the work of Jesus. He never mentions the importance Christ's life, the cross or the empty tomb. Yet on page 58 we find him leading the prayer of &quot;Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you&quot; and then saying &quot;Welcome to the family of God!&quot; How can a person become a Christian without any understanding of his own sinfulness or of Christ's sacrifice on our behalf?<br />Warren's gospel seems to be one of purpose. He teaches that man's greatest problem is purposelessness and this book will remedy that situation by helping the reader discover his purpose. Needless to say, this is not the gospel as taught by the Bible. The Bible teaches that man's greatest problem is that he is a sinner and is alienated from God. Purposelessness is insignificant compared to the possibility of an eternity in hell.<br />Life Application<br />The aim studying the Bible is application. We are to study the Bible so we can apply what we learn to our lives, with the ultimate aim of conforming ourselves to the image of Christ. Application, though, depends on proper teaching and sound knowledge. It stands to reason that a person cannot apply to his life something he does not understand. Teaching stands as the foundation that application is built upon.<br />Since Warren does not explain the gospel and the real means of salvation, how can people truly apply what he teaches? If everything is application, what do they really believe in?<br />Bible Use<br />We have already seen how the author has used multiple translations as well as his justification for doing so. Of even greater concern is his carelessness in his use of the Bible. He continually removes Scripture passages from their proper context in order to make them suit his purposes. He carelessly applies promises to the reader that clearly do not apply. He also distorts or changes the meanings of certain passages to make them say what he wants them to say. This is well-documented in other reviews on this site.<br />I can recommend this book only to discerning readers. There is certainly some value in the book, but in my opinion the bad outweighs the good. I would certainly not use this as an introduction to Christianity or as a means of reaching unbelievers.u&quot; and then saying &quot;Welcome to the family of God!&quot; How can a person become a Christian without any understanding of his own sinfulness or of Christ's sacrifice on our behalf?<br />Warren's gospel seems to be one of purpose.

The book sold some two million copies, though many of these were through a promotion that provided the book at cost when purchased in bulk. Many churches gave the book to those who expressed interest in learning more about Jesus in the aftermath of the movie. Those who are familiar with my book reviews will know that I have struggled with Piper's books in the past - not on the basis of content, but on the basis of Piper's writing style. These people may be glad to know that this is the first book by Piper that I have enjoyed from cover-to-cover.<br /><br />The Passion of Jesus Christ provides fifty reasons why Jesus suffered and died. Piper is careful to look beyond the cause to see the purpose in Jesus' death. Where the movie focused on how Jesus died, and the media frenzy examined who killed Him, this book looks past the controversy to show the purposes behind His death. The author lists fifty reasons, each backed by Scripture and explained in some detail.<br /><br />I was unsure as to how to read this book. Usually a book begins with an introduction and then works toward proving a thesis. In this book Piper provides fifty equal points with no real progression from one to the next. There seems to be little rhyme or reason to the order of their presentation and there is no sense of moving towards a dramatic conclusion. I believe it would make an excellent basis for a devotional book. Reading all fifty chapters, one after the other, did not provide a lot of time to ponder each of the purposes behind Christ's death. In fact, with the addition of a short meditation to each chapter, and perhaps a prayer, it would be a devotional book.<br /><br />Doctrinally (or perhaps editorially), there were a few small concerns. For example, the title of chapter thirteen is \\"To Abolish Circumcision and All Rituals as the Basis of Salvation\\" but of course the rituals and circumcision were never the basis for salvation. There is also an odd statement on page 79 where Piper writes, \\"Becoming a Christian means death to sin. The old self that loved sin died with Jesus. Sin is like a prostitute that no longer looks beautiful. She is the murderer of my King and myself...Sin, the prostitute who killed my friend, has no appeal, she has become an enemy.\\" While becoming a Christian does, indeed, bring death to sin, to say that sin no longer has any appeal is to deny what every person's nature begs for every day. We have been saved, and we are dying to sin, but it still lives within us, constantly trying to draw us back to our old ways. If only sin did not look so appealing! There were a few more minor concerns, including a rather odd view of \\"the futility of our ancestry\\" in chapter 28.<br /><br />Generally this is a good book and one I can recommend to Christians. I am not sure that it makes a very useful resource to give to unbelievers or those who are interested in learning more about Jesus. The doctrine is heavy (which is not a bad thing), and as I indicated before, there is little progression through the book. I doubt many unbelievers would read past the first few chapters. Still, buy it for yourself, read it, and enjoy it. It is well worth your time.ion\\" but of course the rituals and circumcision were never the basis for salvation.

This may be a little-known fact, but I am color-blind, and I'm sure this explains why art has never had much appeal to me. After all, if I see reds, greens and browns all as shades of brown, surely art is far less appealing to me than to those whose eyes work as they were meant to. But I remember one time when I was a teenager, my family travelled to Washington, D.C. with my aunt and uncle, both of whom are artists. Walking with them through the National Gallery brought about an entirely different perspective. Because they understood art, they were able to explain it to me in a way I had never considered. They showed me variations in texture, spoke about the difficulty of different types of shadowing and lighting, and the different media artists use. It opened my eyes, and in that period of time I came to understand and appreciate art so much more deeply than I had before, despite my limitations.<br /><br />I think also of a small museum that was situated on the grounds of an airport near my house. This museum housed some of the finest vintage aircraft in the world, including the world's only Lancaster bomber that was still in operational condition and that still flew. It often took to the skies and flew over my home. It was one thing for my friends and myself to go and look at all the planes, perhaps even imagining that we understood what it was like to stare out at a cold, dark sky, keeping a watchful eye for enemy planes. But it was another thing altogether to watch the veterans who had given their best years to the war, and who had spent countless hours inside these planse - so many hours that they still knew the planes inside and out, even fifty years later. The tears in their eyes as they watched the Lancaster fly over their heads spoke of a knowledge far beyond anything I would ever understand.<br /><br />All this by way of introducing the book A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23. Just like an artist best appreciates an art museum and a veteran best appreciates the aircraft he once flew, in the same way there may be no better guide for the twenty-third Psalm than a shepherd. Phillip Keller grew up in East Africa, in the midst of a culture that was still rooted in the ancient traditions which the Psalmist knew. Keller was also, for many years, a shepherd, who was well acquainted with the language David employed in this best-loved Psalm.<br /><br />Keller guides us phrase-by-phrase through this poem, pausing often to reflect on the nature of the shepherd and his flock, and stopping to give stories based on his experiences. He guides the reader throughout to reflect on the love of the Savior and to see the deepest meanings in each part of the Psalm. The reader will find, as the author did, that \\"...it is no mere whim on God's part to call us sheep. Our behavior patterns and life habits are so much like that of sheep it is well nigh embarrassing\\" (page 65).<br /><br />At times I wonder if Keller has not stretched the metaphor just a little bit too far. For example, he contends that the meaning of \\"thou preparest a table for me\\" is not that God has prepared a banquet feast, as I have long supposed, but that \\"table\\" refers to the top of a hill which a shepherd diligently prepares before the arrival of his flock for their summer pasturage. \\"Thou anointest my head with oil,\\" according to the author, is drawn from the shepherd's task of putting oil on a sheep's head to ward off the pests that can drive a sheep to distraction. I must say, though, that he provides ample evidence that perhaps we have misunderstood the latter part of the Psalm and that David really was holding to the metaphor of sheep and shepherd.<br /><br />In either case, it does not detract from the book. This is a wonderful little book that gave me much to think about, and as my wife can attest, plenty to talk about. Above all, it led me to understand, in a deep and moving way, just how much the shepherd (and thus the Shepherd) loves his (His) sheep. It shows just how involved in the lives of his flock the shepherd must be, and how utterly helpless the sheep are without him (Him). It is amazing how much I learned about a Psalm I thought I knew so well.<br /><br />A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23 is a fascinating, moving book and one whose content will undoubtedly stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend this book - it will cost only a few dollars and take only a few hours to read - for any believer, young or old.h the shepherd (and thus the Shepherd) loves his (His) sheep.

Work Excellence is a light treatment of the subject(112 pages), but one that is valuable. It is conversational in tone and each chapter concludes with questions for reflection and a brief prayer. The book is written by Chuck Garriott, who for over twenty years was pastor of Heritage Presbyterian Church (PCA) in Oklahoma City and whose ministry has taken him around the world. He examines this essential aspect of our lives - one that is discussed in detail throughout the Scripture, and provides a biblical perspective on work excellence.<br /><br />There were many times in reading this book that I was forced to pause and to consider how I work. \\"Every day you need the Savior to work in your life in such a manner that you will outwardly and inwardly please your boss. The ability to follow the Scriptures with any degree of discipline will come from depending on Christ. We have no ability on our own to obey an earthly master with respect, fear and sincerity of heart, even though we may appear to outwardly. If on my own I can please God in this area, then of what value is Christ?\\" (page 27). Do I depend on Christ to help me please my boss (which in my case are clients), or do I attempt to do this on my own? Do I rely on Christ in the workplace as much as in church settings, or have I made a false deliniation between work and spiritual matters?<br /><br />The author is careful to show that work is not a result of the fall, for man was created to care for the earth. One of man's chief purposes, according to God's design, was to work. Yet when man fell, work was made imperfect, just like everything else in all of Creation. \\"When you come home from work tired, worn out and ready to quit, or when you find that weeks have taken over your garden, you are being reminded of God's judgment and wrath. For those who do not believe, it is an unheeded warning of what is to come\\" (page 47). And of course, for those who do believe, it gives us more reason to trust in the promise that having been redeemed, we will one day return to a state where work is enjoyable and holy. \\"The pain and discomfort are temporal. This is the great message of the gospel. If there is no stabbing pain in childbirth or no thistle injury, then there is no gospel. The gospel has no meaning without recognition of the pain from sin that ignites the anger of God. Our hope is in Christ alone, not in the absence of pain\\" (page 51). What a wonderful promise this is, and what hope and encouragement this can bring at the end of a difficult day.<br /><br />Another area of the book that gave me pause for thought was in the section where Garriott warns about work becoming idolatry. \\"Christ calls us to repent from lives so committed to work and all that it produces, that we have turned work into a god. If we work for anything other than God's glory, we worship the creation rather than the Creator\\" (page 78). I had to ask myself whether, when I work, I do from a desire to put food on the table and to do what I know is my duty, or whether I work as an expression of worship towards God.<br /><br />The author's conclusion, and mine, having read the book, is that \\"There is no true excellence in work if the gospel is absent. The gospel not only brings us to a saving relationship with the Lord, but also transforms our lives, including our work and careers\\" (page 112). Our work needs to be more than a responsibility or an obsession - work needs to be an outpouring of our love for and obedience towards our Savior. I am delighted to give this book my recommendation.taken over your garden, you are being reminded of God's judgment and wrath.

It would seem that he has deliberately withheld information about himself, which of course, fits the theme of his bestseller The Purpose Driven Life which is, \\"it's not about you.\\" A Life With Purpose, subtitled \\"Reverend Rick Warren - The Most Inspiring Pastor of Our Time\\" is, as far as I know, the first published biography of Warren. It is not a strictly chronological biography, but instead is more topical. I have to admit that I felt quite skeptical as I began this book, knowing that it was written by George Mair, an author whose previous titles include, Paris Hilton: The Naked Truth, Inside Hbo: The Billion Dollar War Between Hbo, Hollywood, and the Home Video Revolution , Excelsior! : The Amazing Life of Stan Lee and Under the Rainbow: The Real Liza Minnelli. I was interested in seeing how an apparent tabloid author approached Rick Warren.<br /><br />This book is surprisingly light on biographical details, primarily because such information is not widely available. I would estimate that truly biographical facts would comprise only 20 pages of the book. Mair conducted no interviews with Warren or anyone close to him. Instead, he seems to have relied primarily on secondary sources, collecting whatever details he could find in books and publications. The book contains no footnotes or list of sources cited. A Life With Purpose, then, represents less of a biography and more of a collection of the facts about Warren that are publically available. It also contains extensive commentary on the programs and books Warren has written.<br /><br />Allow me to address the author's commentary. After reading the book I am still uncertain as to the author's religious background and beliefs. Generally when I read a biography of a Christian personality, it has been written from a professed Christian and the perspective is clear. In this case it seemed that Mair was perhaps even professing to be a believer. He lavishes praise on Warren throughout the book and often speaks positively of evangelism and other facets of Warren's programs. However, he makes many clear doctrinal mistakes and rash oversimplifications that seem to cast doubt on his understanding of Christianity, both in history and theology. For example, the book begins with a short introduction to Christianity in America that immediately betrays the author's ignorance. He mixes Christianity with New Age, and often oversimplifies. \\"Protestants experienced a divide between modern thinkers, who identified with modern Bible critics, and fundamental thinkers, who followed the Bible literally\\" (page 17). Later, when addressing \\"change vs status quo,\\" he writes, \\"But if we assume that everything, including religion, needs to be able to change in order to survive, then it becomes clear that status-quo churches are only destroying what they are so desperately trying to hold on to. Though the success of the mall church model can't be completely equated to Rick Warren's success at Saddleback, they share the passion for growth and change that some older churches lack. They are willing to take risks, to challenge the \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" crowd\\" (page 122-123). He portrays traditional churches as blindly clinging to tradition, and thus to the status quo, rather than more accurately clinging to the instructions of the Bible. A final example is within the author's commentary on Week 3 of The Purpose Driven Life. \\"Although God creates us all, we don't immediately become a part of His spiritual family. We must have a second birth through baptism to truly become children of God\\" (page 145). This is neither a traditionally Protestant understanding of baptism, nor would it be Warren's understanding. Beyond these concerns, the author also makes several factual mistakes and I was often left with the impression that he had filled-in details about Warren's life where such information was missing.<br /><br />Having addressed my concerns, allow me to comment on the book's positive aspects. Mair rightly identifies Robert Schuller as being a profound influence upon Warren, and Norman Vincent Peale being a primary influence in Schuller's life. He briefly traces the confluence of theology and psychology through Peale and Schuller and suggests that Warren has taken the models developed by those two men and brought them to new levels of popularity. Though he provides only a cursory examination of the topic, I have little doubt that many others will address this topic in detail in the future. He also examines other formative influences, such as Donald McGavran and Gilbert Bilezikian. Second, Mair did enough research that he was able to collect many facts that were previously unknown to me, and surely to many others. As such, this book does provide as much information about Warren as we are likely to know until the publication of an official biography. Finally, I enjoyed the author's secular perspective. He lauded many of the aspects of Purpose Driven methodology that concerned Christians highlight as being more secular than sacred. Having read far too many Christian examinations of Warren's ministry, it was interesting to read one that seemed to be written from outside the church.<br /><br />While far from a perfect biography of Rick Warren, I still found this book interesting and somewhat informative. I am not convinced that the research is entirely honest, nor that the author truly understands Warren and, even more importantly, Christianity. Yet if you are interested in knowing more about Rick Warren, this is the only show in town, and for that reason I will provide a tentative recommentation, but a recommendation premised on the warnings above and founded more on my interest in the subject matter than in the quality of the publication. The book is quite short, at 210 pages (but with large font, wide spacing and many blank pages) and easy to read, despite poor editing for a major publishing company. In the end, it seems that this is a book designed to cash-in on the success of The Purpose Driven Life, but it is one that is not entirely without value.rren's life where such information was missing. <br /> <br />Having addressed my concerns, allow me to comment on the book's positive aspects.

US	43519458	R16XIMIZMIGIW0	0801038553	962746533	Dining With the Devil:  The Megachurch Movement Flirts With Modernity (Hourglass Books)	Books	5	27	30	N	Y	Prophetically Timely	Dining With the Devil is an interesting read, especially in light of the fact that the author, Os Guinness, is describing the very difficulties the church is facing today, even though this book was written over twelve years ago. It is difficult to know if his voice was prophetic or if very little has changed since the early nineties. I suspect both are true.<br /><br />The book is subtitled \\"The Megachurch Movement Flirts with Modernity.\\" We hear much more about postmodernity today than modernity, but this does not seem to detract from the book. Guinness warns that the Megachurch movement, which gained prominence in the eighties and nineties and continues to gain steam today, may be borrowing as much from the devil as from the Lord. And as Peter Berger warns, \\"He who sups with the devil had better have a long spoon.\\" Guinness assesses the movement and warns that much of the foundation for the Megachurch Movement, which can be understood to be synonymous with the Church Growth Movement, is incompatible with Scripture. Some examples he provides are the uncritical use of marketing tools and management theories to induce growth in attendance. \\"When all is said and done,\\" the author states, \\"the church growth movement will stand or fall by one question. In implementing its vision of church growth, is the church of Christ primarily guided and shaped by its own character and calling - or by considerations and circumstances alien to itself\\" (page 35). The heart of this question is one of authority - what will the church submit to as the ultimate authority? Will it be Scripture or will it be the ever-changing, ever-fickle demands of the culture? Is the audience sovereign, or is the message?<br /><br />This book is short on names and specifics of individuals or churches, but long on analysis and warnings.

This is a lesson many thousands of men learned in the 19th century when they stormed California seeking their fortunes. While there was treasure to be found, as evidenced by the wealth many gained from their mining ventures, there was also what came to be known as fool's gold. While this looked like gold, it was in reality valueless iron pyrite. For a miner to be successful he had to learn to discern the true gold from mere fool's gold. A man's livelihood depended on this. Because it was difficult to tell one from the other only by looking at it, miners develped some simple tests. One was the hardness test, where a miner could bite a rock in question. Fool's gold was hard while real gold was much softer. A broken tooth would prove the rock to be fool's gold. For a second test a miner would scrape the rock against a white stone. True gold would leave a yellowish streak while fool's gold would leave one that was greenish-black. This is the historical backdrop against which John MacArthur and the staff of Grace Community Church compare today's church. We are in a time where the church is filled with fool's gold and only godly discernment will show what is true treasure and what is trash.<br /><br />Fool's Gold is divided into four sections. In the first John MacArthur provides a call for biblical discernment and examines the devastating consequences of a watered-down message to the church. The second section, entitled \\"Practicing Discernment in your Local Bookstore\\" examines four of the latest Christian bestsellers in the light of the Scripture. Nathan Busenitz reviews The Purpose Driven Life, Phil Johnson introduces the New Perspective on Paul through What Saint Paul Really Said, Daniel Gillespie evaluates Wild at Heart and Rick Holland looks at The Revolve New Testament Bible-zine. The third section provides pointers for \\"Practicing Discernment in your Local Church.\\" Receiving attention are contemporary worship music, altar calls, the American-Christian approach to politics and the consumer mindset. The book wraps up with an examination of \\"hills to die on\\" - a doctrinal framework for developing discernment, and a practical plan for personal discernment.<br /><br />As we have come to expect from MacArthur's books and ministry, this book is incisive, penetrating and inherently biblical. It cuts to the heart of the matters at hand. In fact, the authors' tasks were quite simple ones - they had to merely hold the church's fads and obsessions up to the light of Scripture and to examine them against God's unchanging standard. In many cases these fads were found wanting. The authors are careful to assign credit where credit is due and are consistently respectful to those whose teachings they oppose. At the same time, they are unapologetic in their defense of the truth and their desire to see God's standards held high.<br /><br />My only disappointments with the book were that the authors did not discuss two of the most pressing issues in evangelicalism today - the Emergent Church (which received only one passing mention) and mysticism, which is gaining a firm hold in the church, in part through the very books the authors evaluate.<br /><br />This book is an excellent introduction to the importance of biblical discernment and a penetrating analysis of how a lack of discernment has allowed error to infiltrate the church and prosper within. Only with a rediscovery of biblical discernment will the church be able to root out this fool's gold. This book will help any Christian develop a foundation for biblical discernment that will allow him to make the crucial distinctions between truth and error. I highly recommend this title, especially as a companion volume to Ashamed of the Gospel and Hard to Believe.American-Christian approach to politics and the consumer mindset.

Intended as a tool for evangelism, it is written in a warn and conversational style. Over sixty pages, author Jim Elliff, president of Christian Communicators Worldwide, leads the reader through the all-important questions and answers in what is a clear and biblical presentation of the gospel.<br /><br />I took me only a couple of pages to realize that I was going to like this book. On page seven Elliff asks, \\"What does God think of me?\\" So many Christians are afraid to address this question from a biblical perspective for fear of driving people away. But Elliff answers, \\"The answer to this question may surprise you - and disappoint you. But the disappointment is necessary. If you do not fully understand the awful predicament that sin puts you in, you may never appreciate Christ's coming, death and resurrection enough to become a Christian.\\" Later he says, \\"Nobody was ever converted to Christ without knowing, and feeling deeply, the terribleness of sin and his or her desperate need for Christ.\\"<br /><br />What follows is an, old-fashioned, out-of-style, non-seeker-friendly presentation of the gospel - the full gospel. Elliff follows Francis Schaeffer's suggestion that if he had only one hour to share the gospel with someone, he would spend 45 minutes showing him the problem and 15 minutes showing him the solution. The final chapter, entitled \\"What Shall I Do\\" does not lead the seeker in a prayer, as we have come to expect from evangelistic materials, but instead suggests some affirmations of an authentic child of God and recommends ways in which the person can find spiritual mentorship. The book contains an appendix which outlines a twenty-one day reading plan through the book of John.<br /><br />This book is intended to be an evangelistic tool. It clearly and unapologetically preaches the gospel, letting God speak for Himself through the words of Scripture.

US	43519458	R1VZJHHMTLCB2T	078521187X	731086189	Blog: Understanding The Information/Reformation That's Changing Your World	Books	3	14	21	N	Y	I Wanted To Love It...	A couple of weeks ago I was browsing through my pastor's library and remarking on the number of people who lay claim to \\"the next Reformation.\\" Over twenty years ago, Robert Schuller told us it would be a Reformation of self-esteem and more recently his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Rick Warren that it will be one of purpose. Other books tell us the next Reformation will involve breaking the church body into small groups, essentially giving the church back to the people in the same way that the first Reformation gave the theology back to the people. And now Hugh Hewitt has entered the fray with his latest book Blog, predicting that the next Reformation will be blogging. The book is subtitled \\"Understanding the information Reformation that's changing your world\\" and the front cover adds, \\"Why you must know how the blogosphere is smashing the old media monopoly and giving individuals power in the marketplace of ideas.\\" This is a book about the power and importance of blogging. If you are looking for a \\"how-to\\" guide to get you started or a book that will explain the pros and cons of commenting or tell you what a trackback ping is, you will have to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Blog is divided into four sections and I will briefly outline each of them. In the first, Hewitt shows the power of \\"blog swarms\\" and provides a historical parallel for this new Reformation. To illustrate the power of blogs, Hewitt traces four of the blogosphere's greatest success stories: the toppling of Trent Lott; Catching the New York Times and reporter Jayson Blair in a lie; John Kerry lying about Christmas in Cambodia; and the Rathergate scandal that toppled Dan Rather. He outlines how these stories broke and how the MSM was usually far behind the blogosphere. In fact, had it not been for bloggers, it is likely that none of these stories would ever have broken in the way they did. And there is no doubt that these are only the first of many similar stories.<br /><br />Following this, Hewitt risks what some Protestants would consider near-blasphemy by drawing direct comparisons between the first and (supposedly) impending Reformations. It is a twelve page \\"Coles Notes\\" summary of the Reformation and critical role played by the newly invented printing press. To summarize, without the movable type printing press, there would have been no Reformation simply because it was a popular movement that was championed by the common man who was provided information via this new medium.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, Hewitt sets out to prove that Mainstream Media (MSM) is facing impending doom and that the blogosphere will be the benefactor in MSM's long-overdue demise. He believes that the overbearing issue in the dissemination of information is trust, and our society is rapidly losing trust in MSM. \\"The key to keep in mind is that trust drives everything. To build and maintain trust is a tremendously difficult thing, requiring patient attention to detail and discipline over long periods of time ... In a world changing as rapidly as ours is, only those who have earned and continue to earn trust will be in a position to influence the choices of third parties. Blogs can earn that most valuable commodity. Which is why you have to get started. Your competitors already have\\" (page 155). The blogosphere offers readers a wide variety of authors to choose from and provides ample opportunity to regain the trust that is so lacking in MSM. This section (and, in fact, the whole book) is firmly slanted to the right (as one might expect if they read Hewitt's blog or listen to his radio program) and Hewitt takes every opportunity to criticize the Democratic Party and every media outlet other than FOX. I suspect this will hinder the potential impact of this book, as it alienates much of its potential audience. If you can see through this slant, you'll find that it is worth your while to keep reading.<br /><br />I understand that the MSM is declining in so far as people no longerwatch the nightly news and buy newspapers as they once did. However, what Hewitt does not do, is trace the number of readers at sites such as cnn.com or cbsnews.com. Is it possible that MSM is merely evolving in the media it uses to present its information? I would suggest that as fewer people tune in to CNN on their television, growing numbers are visiting cnn.com. Thus it seems that Hewitt may be missing the point. Could it be that blogging is merely a symptom of the change that we are seeing as people gravitate towards Internet-based media? Blogging is clearly one of the most exciting and most important aspects of this, but I would suggest that it is merely one aspect of a wider change.<br /><br />I also wonder how plausible it is that MSM will die off. After all, bloggers do not usually create the news. Instead, they interpret the news that the MSM has already reported. Without the MSM, what will bloggers use for source material? What upper level organization will gather the news to disseminate it to the blogosphere so that it can be examined by the growing numbers of pundits? These are questions Hewitt does not adequately address.<br /><br />The third section of the book suggests ways that blogging can be beneficial to individuals and organizations. The author suggests that every CEO should begin a blog to champion his company and his employees and that every hobbyist should be blogging about his hobby. Every major organization needs to secure blog-related domain names, so, for example, General Motors needs to acquire gmblog.com and use it to market their products. And on the whole I agree. Blogging has tremendous potential in a wide variety of applications.<br /><br />The book concludes with two lengthy appendices that comprise almost 30 percent of the book. Appendix A is a disjointed collection of some of Hewitt's early writings on blogging and Appendix B is an assortment of emails sent to him from his readers which describe their blog-reading habits. Some of this is interesting, but most adds no significant value to the book.<br /><br />As I read Blog, I was continually struck by how self-serving the book seemed. It struck me as being almost like the biography of a proud, self-made billionaire, except with site traffic and recognition in place of dollars and European models. If you do not know how many visits Hugh has to his blog in an average day, a busy day or an election day, you will before you have finished the book. You will know how many blogs have been started because of his influence and just how useful a link from his blog to yours can be. I came to realize, though, that in a sense the blogosphere is built on just this sort of self-importance. Bloggers succeed by driving visitors to their sites by whatever means possible. The most important person in the blogosphere is the one with the greatest readership, just like the most important person in my hometown is the one with the most money. And lest I sound hypocritical, I will admit that I have a blog of my own and that I have no right to cast the first stone.<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that, \\"The book reads like it was cranked out over a few long weekends.\\" I suspect that may be the case. Reviews of this book were posted on Amazon as early as December 28 of 2004 and some high-traffic bloggers reported receiving copies as early as December 24, yet the book discusses Hewitt's site traffic during the Presidential elections of that same year, which took place on November 2 (only seven weeks earlier). Some have suggested that the frantic pace of the book owes to the frantic pace of technology in general and the blogosphere in particular. I would suggest that the frantic pace comes from a frantic writing and publishing schedule. Several of the chapters, especially near the end of the book, are so short (several are less than two pages) that it almost seems like the author just never got around to finishing them.<br /><br />I have long since grown tired and skeptical of people claiming to have discovered the next Reformation. I don't believe blogging represents the next Reformation any more than did self-esteem. At the same time, there are some interesting and undeniable parallels between the availability of information at the time of the rise of the Reformers and our time where we are witnessing the rise of the bloggers. Blogging is already going mainstream and, especially in a fast-paced society like our own, it is never good to be left behind.<br /><br />This book has much to say that is valuable, especially in regards to the importance of trust and the application of blogging to corporations and organizations. Unfortunately, I found it frantically-written and poorly-organized. I wanted to love it, but in the end just could not. Yet I still do give recommend it, especially to those in positions of leadership. Its alarmist tone may convince some of the value of blogging, but I suspect just as many others will be put-off. I agree with Hewitt that the blogosphere is giving individuals power in the marketplace of ideas and agree that this is generally a good thing. I think there is great future for the blogosphere.<br /><br />In the end, Blog is a 155-page book, padded with appendices to 220 pages, but one that to treat the topic properly needs to be about 300 pages (with no appendices!). It is, no doubt, a valuable contribution to our understanding of the power and importance of blogging, but it is incomplete.

My initial interest in this book was based on the description which says, \\"For 13 years prior to entering the ministry, Rev. Rodney E. Zwonitzer was a high-level corporate marketing executive for Westinghouse, Storage Technology, and United Technologies Mostek. Now he lays bare the real basis for Church Growth, finding that it is not in the Bible but in business.\\" I assumed this book would examine the claims of church growth through the eyes of one who is adept at studying and evaluating marketing.<br /><br />The book began in a promising fashion with the author providing a primer in marketing; defining it, explaining how it works, and describing his role in it when he was working with large corporations. The most notable information in this initial section is the paradigm shift companies undergo from having the product as the dominant force to the customer being supreme. There were clear reflections of the Church Growth movement in his analysis.<br /><br />Interestingly, there was very little discussion of marketing beyond the initial section. Instead, the author continually compares and contrasts the claims of Church Growth advocates with claims of Confessional Lutherans and we see that the primary purpose of this book is to address the issues of Church Growth within a specific part of the Lutheran body. While this is not what I had expected, I still found it tremendously helpful. Zwonitzer argues from within the clearly defined, historic, structured framework of conservative Lutheranism. While I have read many evangelical responses to Church Growth, they often reply from within the chaos of evangelicalism. I would also point out that the author has a very strong grasp of the methodology, message and claims of Church Growth. This means that he is not arguing against a mere caricature of a movement, but instead probes to the roots, examining men like McGavaran and spending very little time with the modern-day heroes of church growth such as Rick Warren and Bill Hybels. He also gives credit where credit is due, praising Church Growth advocates for their desire to reach the lost, but at the same time affirming that to do this we do not need to resort to such extreme measures in marketing, theology and ecclesiology.<br /><br />He writes, \\"I cannot fault CG [Church Growth] for its fervent desire to seek and save the lost. However, I must ask, Do you give up anything in this rush to grow, to succeed, to be relevant, to please the customer? The evidence convinces me that the answer must be yes. CG gives up the purity of the Gospel and the correct administration of the Sacraments in its zeal to grow.\\"<br /><br />In the end, having examined many of the most pressing issues raised by Church Growth, he concludes that the Lutheran Church must respond to this issue and \\"hammer out a concord through the same means used by our Confessional forefathers.\\" He goes on to say that \\"The new controversy of Church Growth has been allowed to spread for more than two decades among our Confessional churches, bringing a scandal from outside our confession. This scandal must be addressed now before it is given more time to spread. It's time for concord. It's time to show our allegiance. It's time to be Lutherans.\\"<br /><br />So while I am not in the target demographic for this book, and while I disagree with some of the author's ardently Lutheran theology, I did find it a helpful read.he roots, examining men like McGavaran and spending very little time with the modern-day heroes of church growth such as Rick Warren and Bill Hybels.

Written in 1995, during the height of Mother Teresa's popularity, this book was Hitchens' attempt to debunk the myth that was, and remains, Mother Teresa.<br /><br />Written from the perspective of one who clearly is not a Christian, this book has been likened to a cruise missle. It is narrow in scope, yet devastatingly effective, for it strikes right to the heart of the matter. How are we to reconcile Mother Teresa, who cares for the sick and destitute, and Mother Teresa who holds hands and laughs with the wife of a brutal and notorious dictator? How are we to reconcile her desire to live out Christianity when she accepts million-dollar donations from the likes of Charles Keating?<br /><br />The most significant chapter in this book is one which displays Mother Teresa's overwhelming hypocrisy. The author reproduces a letter that was sent from Mother Teresa to Judge Lance Ito, seeking clemency on his behalf. She suggests that while she knows nothing of his business dealings (in which he defrauded people of $250,000,000) what is more important is the service he has rendered to the poor. She asks that the judge to do what Jesus would do, which she evidently believes would be to let him free. Los Angeles deputy D.A., Paul Turley wrote a response to Mother Teresa, suggested that she should return the $1.25 million dollars given to her by Keating, promising he would return it to the rightful owner. He received no response.<br /><br />Many others have written about Mother Teresa and have chastised her for this type of hypocrisy. Many have validated the claims that her care for the poor was more in providing a comfortable place for people to die than in seeking to heal them. Many have shown that she hoarded tens or hundreds of millions of dollars for no apparent purpose when these funds could have gone to build the finest hospitals and orphanages in India. And many Christian writers have shown that her faith bore only a passing resemblance to Christianity. But, as far as I know, this is the most significant (and only book-length treatment) of the subject, though at a mere 98 pages it reads more like an essay than a book.<br /><br />As one who reads primarily books written by professed Christians, I was taken aback by Hitchens' prevailing attitude. \\"Given how much this Church allows the fanatic Mother Teresa to preach, it might be added that the call to go forth and multiply, and to take no thought for the morrow, sounds grotesque when uttered by an elderly virgin whose chief claim to reverence is that she ministers to the inevitable losers in this very lottery\\" (page 59). He is cynical, angry, hateful and sarcastic all at once. He despises the hypocrisy he sees in Mother Teresa and seems happy to extend his disillusionment to religion in general. He attacks not only Mother Teresa, but also Roman Catholic doctrine and practice, and even further, extends his attacks to Christianity and the Bible, especially Christian teaching on the sanctity of human life. And throughout, he uses only four footnotes, providing little evidence to support his claims. Despite all that, he argues effectively and some may even say, devastatingly.<br /><br />In some ways this subject hardly seems to matter anymore, now that Mother Teresa has long since died. Yet her legacy lives on. Mother Teresa is still lauded as a hero by Catholics, Protestants and people of every other creed. It seems amply clear to those who are willing to look that her legacy is largely ficticious.ve gone to build the finest hospitals and orphanages in India.

Never have Christians tried to be so relevant, and yet never have they been so terribly irrelevant. How could this happen? It is this question that Os Guinness addresses in Prophetic Untimeliness, which claims to be \\"A Challenge to the Idol of Relevance.\\" Guinness says that the goal of the book is to explore how the stupidity of relevance has come about. \\"How on earth have we Christians become so irrelevant when we have tried so hard to be relevant?...Never have Christians pursued relevance more strenuously; never have Christians been more relevant\\" (page 11, 12).<br /><br />Before beginning the study in earnest, the author is careful to define relevance, which he says is \\"the quality of relating to a matter in hand with pertinence and appropriateness\\" (page 12). He says that relevance is the very heart of the gospel, for there can be no message more relevant than that of sin and salvation. But this is not the relevance that the evangelical church has sought, and thus they have missed out on true relevance. The true question the church needs to face is how to be both faithful and relevant.<br /><br />Here is the thesis of the book: \\"By our uncritical pursuit of relevance we have actually courted irrelevance; by our breathless chase after relevance without a matching committment to faithfulness, we have become not only unfaithful, but irrelevant; by our determined efforts to redefine outselves in ways that are more compelling to the modern world than are faithful to Christ, we have lost not only our identity but our authority and our relevance. Our crying need is to be faithful as well as relevant\\" (page 15).<br /><br />It came as a surprise that following this introduction challenging the church's assumptions about relevance, the first section of the book is dedicated to the Western world's obsession with time and timeliness. There are three features of modern clock time that shape our lives and our thinking: precision, coordination and pressure. This overbearing emphasis on time is driving our lives. Guinness refers to the clock as \\"the tool that turned into a tyrant\\" (page 25). In the next chapter he writes about the tyrannies of time - the deeper features of a clock-driven society that effect our lives. All of this leads to the conclusion that because of our obsession with time, we regard what is contemporary as inherently better than what is from the past, and we regard what is future as better than what is present. In short, the latest is the greatest. We assume that progress is change, and change is progress, yet history shows clearly that this is not always the case. Having examined how the pressures of modern time have shaped our lives, he is now able to examine relevance.<br /><br />The second section of the book begins the examination of relevance. Guinness outlines four steps to irrelevance, which should be self-explanatory. They are: Assumption, Abandonment, Adaptation and Assimilation. We need to be shaped by our faith rather than the world, yet we have allowed the world to shape our faith in the name of relevance. In so-doing we have lost the most relevant message in the world. We have bowed before the forces of cultural captivity - conformity, popularity and fashionability.<br /><br />All of this leads to the author's call for prophetic untimeliness; a call for people who will stand on the relevance of the gospel message even at the expense of perceived cultural relevance. This may lead to us feeling maladjusted, impatient or even feeling like failures, yet we do not need to worry about how people perceive us or even about the legacy we will leave behind. We need to be faithful and obedience above all. In the end, all that matters is the eternal, and only the gospel message carries an eternal impact. If we downplay this message, we have become unfaithful and irrelevant. To go forward, the church must go back and learn how to be fresh and creative, while maintaining faithfulness.<br /><br />This book is a timelyand faithful call to the church and one we would all do well to read and consider. It stands as a forceful critique of the idol of relevance and a loving call to the church to recover the only message that can truly make her relevant. I give this one a wholehearted recommendation.is a timely and faithful call to the church and one we would all do well to read and consider.

Having it available in the English Standard Version, which many consider the best available English translation, simply raises the bar. With R.C. Sproul at the helm and the list of editors reading like a who's-who of Reformed theology, the reader can have confidence that he is in good hands with these notes. Among those who contributed are J. I. Packer, James Boice, Roger Nicole and Wayne Grudem. Philip Ryken spoke well when he said \\"this is the gold standard for study Bibles.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest feature of the study notes is that when they address a controversial subject, the authors provide the differing viewpoints but then point out which is most consistent with Reformed theology. In the past I have been continually dismayed to see how many study Bibles remain noncommital on the tough issues. Adding to the value of this book are the doctrinal notes which appear throughout the Bible. These notes address such difficult topics as justification, election and the nature of the church. All of these topics are addressed from a consistently Reformed worldview.<br /><br />To summarize, if you are looking for a study Bible, you will not do better than this. It combines the scholarship and literary quality of the English Standard Version with the consistently Reformed perspectives of the study notes to make the best study Bible available today.	2005-03-05

The man who brought us I Kissed Dating Goodbye when he was just twenty-one, and who is best known for bringing courtship to a whole new generation, is now senior pastor of a large and growing church and no longer speaks at conferences. Stop Dating The Church is his first book targetted at an audience wider than merely teens and parents of teens.<br /><br />Harris believes that many, and perhaps even the majority of Christians, have a fear of committment to the church. Rather than committing to a local body of believers, most Christians \\"date the church,\\" refusing to commit to a long-term relationship. He says, \\"This is my third book on relationships, but it's unlike any of my previous books...this book is about how you should relate to the family of God\\" (page 12). In Failing to commit to the church, we cheat ourselves, we cheat our church community and we cheat the world.<br /><br />Over the next six chapters, Harris explains the beauty of the church, our need for the church, what committment to a church involves, what to look for in a church, and how to make Sunday the best day of the week. He draws liberally from the books and teachings of Charles Spurgeon, Don Whitney and John Piper, and builds convincing, biblical arguments. Chapters five and six are particularly engaging. The fifth chapter lays out ten criteria by which to choose a church. The sixth chapter provides some suggestions for redeeming Sunday and restoring it to a place of distinction whereby we use it deliberately as a day to refuel our spiritual batteries.<br /><br />I must admit that this is the first of Harris' books that I have read, and I was thoroughly impressed by his committment to Scripture, to expository preaching, and to the historic tenets of Protestantism. The men under whose influence he has grown seem to be theologically-sound, showing that he has a true committment to biblical doctrine.<br /><br />There is not much in this book that has not been said elsewhere more thoroughly and perhaps even more convincingly. But what this book adds to the discussion is accessibility. It should appeal to many young people who already know and appreciate Harris' ministry, and will engage young people who may shy away from longer treatments of the subject. Weighing in at only 129 pages (and small pages at that) this is a book that can be read and digested in a couple of hours. It will undoubtedly benefit all who read it and I give it my recommendation, especially to young people who are disillusioned by the church and may be turning their backs on her.said elsewhere more thoroughly and perhaps even more convincingly.

If evangelicals wish to take stock of where they are now and what the future of the church holds, they must look to the past and understand from where it is they have come. Evangelicalism Divided by Iain Murray, would be a perfect place to start, for it is a record of the changes that took place in the American and British churches in the years 1950 to 2000. It records the rise of influences and influencers that ultimately changed the course of evangelicalism.<br /><br />The book begins with an examination of Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) and the theology of experience that influenced so many. The God of Schleiermacher was a mere man, and one who bore little resemblance to the God of the Bible. To defend God against criticism, Schleiermacher redefined Christianity as mere subjectivity and not an objective Truth. This stunning departure from Scripture provides a foundation for many beliefs that later gained prominence in evangelicalism.<br /><br />Having set the scene, Murray begins to examine many of the men and organizations that have directly shaped contemporary evangelicalism. He speaks of Billy Graham, J.I. Packer, John Stott and organizations such as Inter Varsity. While he is unafraid to name names, he avoids slander and conjecture, always speaking in love and always providing ample support for his claims. He writes about controversies in the Church of England during the sixties, about the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Evangelicals and Catholics Together (ECT). He writes also of controversy regarding how we ought to define a Christian and how we ought to define the church. Having thoroughly examined the modern history of evangelicalism, he raises questions and concerns about the present. The general conclusions he reaches are as follows:<br /><br />  * The history of the new evangelicalism has shown how difficult it is to remedy the faults of one position without falling into dangers at the opposite extreme.<br />  * A great deal of the confusion which has divided evangelicalism has been related to the question, \\"Who is a Christian?\\"<br />  * The church cannot succeed in the same way in which political parties may succeed.<br />  * The period of history confirms the painful fact that there can be serious differences of belief and consequent controversies among true Christians.<br />  * The history of this period shows how hard it is for leaders to look in different directions at once.<br />  * The struggles and hopes of Christians are not to be understood in terms of the present and the temporal.<br /><br />In short, Murray concludes that evangelicalism, as we know it today, has been unduly influenced by Schleiermacher. What is particularly amazing is that so few evangelical leaders know or care.<br /><br />While this is sobering, we should not be discouraged or dismayed. Murray concludes, \\"At almost all times in history the kingdom of God has appeared to be in confusion to the outward eye. It is faith in the promises of God which provides a different perspective. The Holy Spirit assures us that infinite wisdom and love are presently directing the life of the church and that eternity will be witness to their success when a multitude which no man can number will be glorified with Christ\\" (page 317).<br /><br />This book is fascinating, disturbing and critically important. I hope many evangelical pastors and leaders turn to this book to help them understand where evangelicals have come from so they can make necessary course corrections to lead where we need to go next. I give this book my recommendation.evangelicalism has been related to the question, \\"Who is a Christian?\\"      * The church cannot succeed in the same way in which political parties may succeed.      * The period of history confirms the painful fact that there can be serious differences of belief and consequent controversies among true Christians.      * The history of this period shows how hard it is for leaders to look in different directions at once.      * The struggles and hopes of Christians are not to be understood in terms of the present and the temporal.

US	43519458	R13VI6MS7V44KC	0891097724	952568414	How Can I Be Sure I'm a Christian?: What the Bible Says About Assurance of Salvation (LifeChange)	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Highly Recommended Book!	Almost everyone who believes in the existence of heaven also believes he will be there. I cannot count the number of times I have heard the statistic that fully 99% of Americans believe they will be in heaven some day. However, the Bible certainly gives no reason to believe that 99% of people will be welcomed into heaven. Thus many people, and perhaps even the majority of people, live with false assurance of their eternal destination. How Can I Be Sure I'm A Christian by Don Whitney, is a book concerned with helping Christians understand how they be assured of their salvation and how to discern true from false assurance.<br /><br />In the foreward, John MacArthur notes that assurance of salvation is the birthright and privilege of every true believer in Christ. Despite this, almost every believer wrestles with this at one time or another. \\"Knowing how to handle such doubts, understanding the self-examination that is required (2 Corinthians 13:5), discerning the evidences of Christ in us, and above all focusing our faith on the promises of Scripture and the character of God - those are the keys to maintaining true assurance.\\" (page 8) These are the topics the author examines in this book.<br /><br />The book begins with an examination of whether assurance of salvation is possible. Though many Christians have been taught that it is not possible and may even be dangerous, the Bible presents assurance as something that is not only available, but is a crucial aspect of our Christian walk. In fact, an entire book of the Bible was written to address this very topic. \\"These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life...\\" (1 John 5:13) After assuring the reader that assurance is possible and that doubts about our salvation are normal (and perhaps even healthy), Whitney examines the basis of our assurance. Far too many believers base their assurance on statements beginning with \\"because I...\\" but if our assurance is founded upon anything we have done, we have taken false assurance. Our assurance needs to be in the promises and character of God, not in decisions, baptisms, family or good deeds. The book then turns to a discussion of the confirmations and evidences of conversion. These include the Spirit's inner confirmations as well as external evidences such as conscious obedience to God's Word and a hatred of the ways of the world. There are several chapters dedicated to things that erode our confidence as well as false assurances of salvation. The book closes with a chapter on what to do if you are still not sure.<br /><br />As with all of Whitney's books, he quotes Scripture liberally and draws heavily upon the wisdom of Christians of days gone by, and especially the Puritans. He builds a convincing case that assurance is possible and provides many helpful pointers as to how we can have that assurance of salvation. This book is guaranteed to challenge any believer, both in his lifestyle and in his assumptions concerning assurance.<br /><br />In conclusion, I will quote the glowing endorsement of James Boice, who writes \\"If you have questions about your assurance or even somebody else's, you should read this book. Dr. Whitney's illustrations are superb, and his borrowings from the great theologians of the past are wise, stimulating, and well-chosen. I commend his work highly.\\" To echo Boice, I unreservedly recommend this book.our assurance is founded upon anything we have done, we have taken false assurance.

Having heard so much about how the book will change my life and cause my faith to grow in leaps and bounds, I have often found the reality to be disappointing. Conversely, sometimes a book comes unhyped and unheralded and takes my heart and mind by storm. Such is the case with The Cross He Bore by Frederick Leahy.<br /><br />Truthfully, I do not remember where I first heard of this book. I was surprised one day to see it turn up in the mail and I soon realized that at one point I had added it to my Amazon wishlist. I knew nothing about it other than what the cover told me: \\"Meditations on the sufferings of the Redeemer.\\" Edward Donnelly writes in the foreward that this book has three virtues: it provides solid instruction; gives full play to a disciplined and sanctified imagination; and it recalls the neglected art of meditation. He says further that \\"in rereading these chapters, I found myself more than once compelled by emotion to stop - and then to worship. I cannot help feeling that this is exactly how they were written and that the author's chief desire is that each of us who reads should be brought to gaze in fresh understanding and gratitude upon 'the Son of God,' who loved me and give himself for me.\\" As with Donnelly, I was often compelled to stop and worship, to stop and meditate, or to stop and dry my eyes, thanking Christ for His immeasurable sacrifice.<br /><br />The book is comprised of thirteen chapters, each of which is a short meditation or reflection on a different aspect of Christ's sacrifice, from the close of the Last Supper to the blotting of the sun from the sky while He hung on the cross. It truly strikes to the very heart of the Gospel.<br /><br />But I hesitate to say more. Perhaps part of the beauty and significance of this book, was that it came unannounced. There was no lofty position for it to attain to. And perhaps it is best that way. And so I will leave it with merely my wholehearted recommendation and the knowledge that I will return to it often. This short book is an invaluable treasure and I am certain that the reflections it contains will stay with me and come to heart and mind whenever I meditate upon the cross of Christ.perhaps it is best that way. And so I will leave it with merely my wholehearted recommendation and the knowledge that I will return to it often.

Some of these turn into articles and others turn into devotional material. More often than not I look at them weeks or months later and have absolutely no idea what they mean or what I was thinking when I scribbled them down. Recently I saw a comment in a notebook that did make sense to me. I had written about the difference between my friend Jason and myself when we sit down with a guitar on our laps and a sheet of music in front of us. I can read the music and strum those strings and make nothing but awful, painful sounds that bear little resemblance to music. Jason, on the other hand, can sit down and make music at will, even with no sheet music in front of him. The difference between Jason and myself is not necessarily inate musical ability or the quality of our guitars. The difference is in disciplined practice. Jason has dedicated thousands of hours to honing his skills so that it seems to require little effort to play the music. The freedom to play with this skill has come only at the expense of dedicated, disciplined effort.<br /><br />Don Whitney uses this same metaphor to show the importance of being disciplined in the pursuit of godliness, for there is freedom in discipline. The freedom to grow in godliness - \\"to naturally express Christ's character through your own personality - is in large part dependent on a deliberate cultivation of the spiritual disciplines.\\" (From the back cover)<br /><br />And so this book is an examination of spiritual disciplines - disciplines provided by God which are designed to help us grow in godliness, allowing us to become more and more conformed to the image of Christ. The disciplines Whitney writes about are:<br /><br />  * Bible intake<br /><br />  * Prayer<br /><br />  * Worship<br /><br />  * Evangelism<br /><br />  * Serving<br /><br />  * Stewardship<br /><br />  * Fasting<br /><br />  * Silence and solitude<br /><br />  * Journalling<br /><br />  * Learning<br /><br />The book is prefaced with an examination of the reason for disciplining ourselves in the spiritual disciplines and Whitney teaches here that we are to do all things for God's glory. Because God requires each of these disciplines of us, there is danger in neglecting any of them. Each of the disciplines is then examined in the light of bringing glory to God through them. The book closes with encouragment in persevering in the disciplines, even in the inevitable times of spiritual dryness.<br /><br />Each of the disciplines is drawn from and examined in the light of Scripture. The author shows how the Biblical basis for each discipline, explains how it will help the Christian grow in godliness and provides practical suggestions for beginning the practice. Each chapter closes with a section entitled \\"More Application\\" where the reader is challenged to put these practices info effect in his life.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects about Whitney's writings, in this book and his others, is that he draws heavily from the Puritans and from other great Christians of the past. This is especially important in a discussion of spiritual disciplines as these are practices that were regarded more highly in the past than they are today. When we examine such practices, there is much to learn from these great believers.<br /><br />While the vast majority of sources cited in this book are from Puritan and other Reformed authors, there were several references to Richard Foster. I questioned Whitney about this and he replied as follows: \\"...since it was not an academic book, I didn't want the emphasis to be critical (in the academic sense), but rather simply to set forth in practical ways what I thought the Biblical teaching on the subjects to be, and to find good supportive quotations. Occasionally it served my purposes to quote Foster. But I never tried to sound as approvingly of him when I quoted him as I did with most other writers. For instance, I never said something like, 'As the GREAT Richard Foster said,'...it was before Foster had started Renovare and before he had tipped his hand on some other matters.\\" He also referred me to a couple of article he has written which show his thoughts on Christian mysticism (link and link 2). Lest I make a mountain of a molehill, I was completely satisfied with Whitney's answer and in no way do I feel that his references to Foster's work detracts from the powerful message in Spiritual Disciplines For The Christian Life. I merely did not wish to have people see the references to Foster in the bibliography and be scared away from a wonderful book.<br /><br />I found this book powerful and above all, convicting. Because it is so Biblical, continually returning to the Word of God, it allowed the Spirit to act and convict me in areas of my life where I have become lax. While I rejoice that God has allowed me to become disciplined in some areas of life, I know now that there are many others where I must make changes, lest I stunt my spiritual growth.

The Cromwell Association says rightly that \\"since his death as Lord Protector in 1658, Cromwell's life, ambitions, motives and actions have been the subject of scholarly investigation and intense, often vitriolic, debate. Whatever position is taken on Cromwell, 'Chief of Men' or 'Brave Bad Man', his importance as a key figure in one of the most troubled periods of British history is unassailable.\\" Within the church there has also been debate about Cromwell as believers try to discern if Cromwell was a great Christian figure or one who merely operated under the guise of Christian ideals. Martyn Lloyd-Jones writes of Cromwell \\"That great period during Cromwell's Protectorate...was one of the most amazing epochs in the whole history of [England]. To me it was certainly one of the most glorious...Oliver Cromwell is a man whom we do not honour as we should.\\" One of the oldest volumes in my library is one entitled simply Cromwell that was written by the great church historian J.H. Merle D'Aubigne in the first half of the nineteenth century. D'Aubigne says that the object of his work is \\"the rectification of the common opinion with regard to Cromwell's religious character.\\" The way D'Aubigne proposed to rectify the common opinion of Cromwell's religious character is much the same as Michael Haykin has done in the contemporary volume To Honour God: The Spirituality of Oliver Cromwell - he has allowed Cromwell's words to speak for themselves. As D'Aubigne says, \\"it is not we who ought, in this day, to justify the great Protector; he should justify himself; and fortunately authentic and authoritative testimony is not wanting for this purpose.\\"<br /><br />To Honour God: The Spirituality of Oliver Cromwell is primarily a collection of Cromwell's letters, excerpts from his speeches, and even deathbed utterances. There is a brief introduction to Cromwell, but apart from that, the rest of the volume is dedicated to Cromwell's words. Haykin provides some brief commentary and explanation for each of Cromwell's writings, but only as much as is necessary to provide historical context, Biblical references, or explanation of words that are no longer in use.<br /><br />Here is a sample of what you will find in this volume. This is a letter \\"For my very loving Brother, Richard Maijor, Esquire.\\"<br /><br />  Dear Brother,<br /><br />  ...I hope you give my son good counsel; I believe he needs it. He is in the dangerous time of his age, and it's a very vain world. O, how good it is to close with Christ betimes; there is nothing else worth the looking after. I beseech you call upon him. I hope you will discharge my duty and your own love; you see how I am employed. I need pity. I know what I feel. Great place and business in the world is not worth the looking after; I should have no comfort in mine but that my hope is in the Lord's presence. I have not sought these things; truly I have been called unto them by the Lord, and therefore am not without some assurance that he will enable his poor worm and weak servant to do his will, and to fulfil my generation. In this I beg your prayers.<br /><br />Here is another brief excerpt from the close of a letter of encouragement and admonition addressed to his son Harry. \\"If the Lord did not sustain me, I were undone; but I have, and I shall live, to the good pleasure of his grace. I find mercy at need. The God of all glory keep you.\\" Another of my favorite letters was one he penned to his wife in which he affirmed that he prays for her and their children daily, and seeks her prayers on his behalf.<br /><br />Having read this book and having understood the words penned by Cromwell, it would be difficult to conclude anything other than that this man was a believer - a man who, in Puritan fashion, understood his own depravity, but took great comfort in God's grace. I realize, too, that there is far more to Cromwell than what is presented in these pages. He was a man as corrupted by sin as any of us, and faced with far greater temptations and responsibilities than most. D'Aubigne cautions that \\"in studying the life of Cromwell, the reader will undoubtedly have frequent reason to bear in mind the saying of Holy Scripture, In many things we offend all.\\" However, Cromwell deserves to be understood in the light of his dedication to the Lord, for as Lloyd-Jones has said, perhaps he is a man \\"whom we do not honour as we should.\\" I will close with more of the words of D'Aubigne, who says that after having examined the evidence \\"we are compelled, unless we shut our eyes to the truth, to change our opinion of him, and to acknowledge that the character hitherto attached to this great man is one of the grossest falsehoods in all history.\\"ented in these pages.

I admire John Piper and have grown tremedously through his ministry. He is a gifted teacher and one I deeply respect. Yet for some strange reason I do not enjoy his books. I have tried reading several of his books several times and have never enjoyed doing so. I don't know why this is, but I suspect it may be his style of writing. He employs many short sentences and writes in flowery prose I usually find only in the writing of Victorian authors. Maybe there is another reason that is hidden to me. What I do know is that, as tragic as this may be, it will probably be a long time before I read one of his books again. I feel guilty about this, especially when I read other reviews where people praise this as being one of their favorite books and one that has done so much for their spiritual formation. Perhaps I will pick one up and try again next year.<br /><br />Now despite my difficulty in reading this book, there is much of value within it. Piper has many good things to say about living a life that is sold out to God. He gives a lot of useful, practical guidance on living a life passionately devoted to displaying God's excellence in every area of our lives. As you would expect if you have read any of Piper's previous books or articles, the teaching that \\"He is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him\\" appears frequently. The standout chapter for me was the one dedicated to risk. The author teaches that to avoid risking it all for Christ is to waste one's life. Of course this is not foolish, irrational financial or physical risk, but a calculated, spiritual risk that may expose one to the risk of injury or suffering. He supports this claim with many examples from the Bible - Joab, Esther, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and of course, Paul. To become a Christian was a risk, but the risk must continue through the believer's life.<br /><br />Other topics the book covers include: the goal of life, living to prove Christ is precious, the majesty of Christ in missions and magnifying Christ through pain and death.<br /><br />So what can I say? While I benefitted from the teaching of this book and know many others have as well, I simply did not enjoy reading it. However, I know that the fault for that lies with me. Therefore, I will recommend this book, knowing that so many have benefitted from it.in missions and magnifying Christ through pain and death. <br /> <br />So what can I say? While I benefitted from the teaching of this book and know many others have as well, I simply did not enjoy reading it. However, I know that the fault for that lies with me.

We look at the people in our churches who are involved in all the committees and are at every meeting and assume that they are the ones with the greatest measure of spiritual health. But do you think that is the measure God uses? Or does he have a different set of criteria by which He judges spiritual health? This short but powerful book examines the Bible's teaching on this matter.<br /><br />As one might expect by the title, Ten Questions To Diagnose Your Spiritual Health, this book presents the reader with ten criteria that can point towards spiritual health. The crux of the matter, the theme that flows throughout the book, is this: is your character becoming more like Christ's? Here are the ten questions the reader faces:<br /><br />  1. Do you thirst for God?<br /><br />  2. Are you governed increasingly by God's Word?<br /><br />  3. Are you more loving?<br /><br />  4. Are you more sensitive to God's presence?<br /><br />  5. Do you have a growing concern for the spiritual and temporal needs of others?<br /><br />  6. Do you delight in the bride of Christ?<br /><br />  7. Are the spiritual disciplines increasingly important to you?<br /><br />  8. Do you still grieve over sin?<br /><br />  9. Are you a quicker forgiver?<br /><br />  10. Do you yearn for heaven and to be with Jesus?<br /><br />Each of the questions is approached and evaluated in the light of Scripture and in a way consistent with Reformed theology. In the introduction Whitney writes \\"In our day, as in theirs [the Puritans], the timeless process of discerning one's spiritual health involves questions and tests. My purpose in writing these pages is to act as a physician of the soul - to ask questions and suggest spiritual tests that can, by the help of the Holy Spirit, enable you to self-diagnose your spiritual health.\\" This book bears a great resemblance to the writing of the Puritans in the sense that they were continually searching their hearts before God to discern where sin had taken hold of their lives. Their honesty and diligence in this matter was clearly influential in Whitney's writing.<br /><br />There are a couple of places where the author could have taken a misstep but did not. When I saw that a chapter was dedicated to sensitivity to God's presence I began to wonder how the author would approach this topic, and was glad to see that it bore no resemblance to the practices of Brother Lawrence and the other mystics that are so popular today. Instead he introduces the six ways we should understand the Bible's teaching on God's presence and how the believer is to practice them.<br /><br />Far from being yet another self-help or an easy-answer, ten-step book, this one is deep and penetrating. Reading this book and meditating on the questions will be sure to move believers towards a deeper relationship with Jesus. I highly recommend it!arching their hearts before God to discern where sin had taken hold of their lives.

It means that, as a pastor, you know the incalculable worth of aligning your church with God's vision...Transitioning is written for you.\\" (From the back cover). We also learn from the cover that the book will help a pastor and congregation navigate change and attain rewards that far exceed the risk. Essentially, this book is a how-to guide for changing an existing church from program-driven to purpose-driven. It is written by Dan Southerland, but endorsed by Rick Warren who says that Southerland's church is \\"one of the most exciting and encouraging examples of transitioning from being program driven to purpose driven.\\" (From the foreward)<br /><br />I always take the time to read the author's bio that is generally on the back cover of a book as it usually outlines the author's credentials, providing the reader with some confidence that the author is worth learning from. As if to emphasize the concerns of those who believe that the church growth movement is driven by pragmatism, the author's bio says \\"Dan Southerland is the pastor/teacher at Flamingo Road Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida - a purpose-driven, contemporary congregation that has grown from 300 in 1989 to over 2,300 today and launched seventeen other churches.\\" The author's sole credential is that he has made the Purpose Driven principles work by seeing the requisite numerical growth.<br /><br />I have little doubt that this book can help many churches move from being \\"program-driven\\" (which is synonymous with \\"traditional\\") to purpose-driven. There is a logical model to follow, there are plenty of practical examples, and many blanks to fill in as part of the workbook section in the back. Those who believe that Purpose Driven churches are the wave of the future, will find much here to praise and imitate. Those who believe Purpose Driven churches are tearing the Christian world to pieces will similarly find plenty to support their belief. I am no lover of Purpose Driven principles, so allow me to point out some of my foremost concerns with the book.<br /><br />First, the principles within this book are steeped in pragmatism. What works is elevated far above what Scripture teaches. If it works, in the author's view, it must be good. This is, of course, consistent with The Purpose Driven Church which is modeled as much on Peter Drucker as on the Bible.<br /><br />Second, the author misuses Scripture. In a vain attempt to lend Scriptural credence to the book, the author bases the process of transition on the model of Nehemiah, who led the Israelites in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. Many of these parallels are forced and the Scripture simply does not support the conclusions. For example, when discussing the reality and inevitability of opposition, Southerland writes about Sanballat and his opposition to Nehemiah's work (see Nehemiah chapters 2 and 4). Of course there is vast difference between opposition raised by a hostile unbeliever and a concerned believer! Southerland, though, groups all those who oppose change as Sanballats.<br /><br />Third, the author does away with biblical models of leadership. One of the necessary steps in moving to a Purpose Driven church is to make the church staff led instead of committee/deacon led. Rather than having a plurality of elders, a church should have a vision team which is composed of dreamers and power brokers, so that the church becomes led by those who dream big and those who have the money and power within the church.<br /><br />Fourth, the churches the author proposes are custom-built to appeal to a very limited element of society. It is not mere chance that the author's church had the average age of attender fall nearly 20 years over his transition period. The church was custom made to appeal to a certain element of society at the expense of others. Who is building and planting churches designed to appeal to the elderly?<br /><br />Fifth, there is little consideration given to whether this transition is right or biblical. We are to blindly accept that it is the way to do church and to begin the process, regardless of what other church members may desire. The first step in transition is creating a vision. This teaching about vision is something that is in-line with the teachings of Schuller, Warren, Wilkinson, Blackaby and the New Age - we are to dream a big dream, call it vision, and raise that up as our standard. Decisions are made and programs are accepted or rejected based on their conformity to this vision. Yet this vision is created by a man. He may ascribe it to God and it may be biblical, but it needs to be regarded as a lower standard than the Word of God!<br /><br />Sixth, the method is brutal in its dealing with opposition. There is no latitude given for those who oppose the change, even if they object on biblical grounds. Criticism is viewed as inevitable and unfortunate, but ultimately an attack on God Himself. The pastor is cautioned to remain on track with the change and not allow opposers to derail the process.<br /><br />Those are a few of my concerns. Ultimately, if you are committed to being Purpose Driven, this book may help you avoid making some costly mistakes in transitioning your church, but I would urge you to spend some time studying the biblical concerns of the opponents of this movement. Determine for yourself if this movement is pleasing to God and if it really does represent the way God would have us \\"do church.\\" For those who are opposed to the movement this book has little value. It does provide an interesting case study of the Purpose Driven Church in action but it will merely add fuel to your fire. There must be some better way to spend your money.early 20 years over his transition period. The church was custom made to appeal to a certain element of society at the expense of others.

Deceived On Purpose is probably the most important contribution in the ongoing discussion about Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life and all things Purpose Driven. It is one of only a couple of book-length treatments of the subject and the one that brings the most to the table. The author, Warren Smith, is a former New Ager who, after being saved, researched and has written extensively on the topic of spiritual deception. Having been immersed in the New Age movement for many years, he is sensitive to the inroads of New Age beliefs into Christianity. He says \\"Because of my New Age background, I have written this book Deceived on Purpose to specifically address some of the New Age implications of these purposes [for the church].\\" His discussion of the New Age implications of The Purpose Driven Life merits consideration by all concerned believers.<br /><br />The author is clear from the beginning that this book is not a mix of positives and negatives. He believes that Rick Warren is leading the church astray and will mince no words in defending the Body of Christ. Leafing through the book, the reader might be surprised to see how much of the book is dedicated to a discussion of Robert Schuller. As a matter of fact, I suspect the book has more references to Schuller than to Warren. Why this apparently misplaced emphasis? Smith contends that many of Warren's ideas and beliefs were shaped by Schuller. Hence to learn about Schuller is to learn about Warren.<br /><br />Smith leaves no stone unturned in exposing Robert Schuller as a major player in the New Age movement. Schuller has often invited New Age teachers to appear on his show and preach from his pulpit. New Age courses have been taught on the campus of his church, New Age materials are sold in the bookstore and he often declares his affection for the teaching of New Age gurus. It seems his New Age beliefs are common knowledge amongst New Agers as they consider him a leader who may be able to bridge the increasingly blurry gap between the New Age and Christianity.<br /><br />Ironically and alarmingly, Schuller is also a major player in the Christian church. Having spent great attention on exposing Schuller as a false teacher, the author then shows the connection between Schuller and Rick Warren. Warren trained extensively under Schuller and acknowledges him as one of his primary influences. Many of the concepts and even sentences from The Purpose Driven Life are taken directly or almost directly from Schuller's writings, and these were in turn culled from New Age material. The author provides many examples of this, but I will contain myself to one. In this brief section Warren quotes from The Message:<br /><br />The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren - \\"The Bible says, 'He rules everything and is everywhere and is in everything.'\\"<br /><br />Hour of Power (November 9, 2003) by Robert Schuller - \\"Yes, God is alive and He is in every single human being!\\"<br /><br />Prescriptions for Living by Bernie Siegel - \\"God is in everyone and everything.\\"<br /><br />There are many similar (and even more clear) examples where Warren has borrowed or even plagarized the writings of Schuller. The conclusion we must draw if that Schuller is as corrupt as Smith portrays him, we must necessarily be suspect of Warren and any others who have trained under Schuller. While they are not covered in great detail, the author dedicates a small amount of time to exposing The Message and the writings of Bruce Wilkinson as having a similar New Age bent. Wilkinson was another man who was profoundly influence by Schuller, and thus by the New Age.<br /><br />It is no great surprise that this book has been published by a small publishing company (Mountain Streams Press). While it is well-written, well-researched and convincing, it deals with a subject matter most publishers will want to avoid. Despite being confined to small distribution channels, I was glad to see that it is in its second edition and that a third is underway. I believe it has many important things to say and that Christians need to evaluate the teachings of Warren to see if they are consistent with the Scriptures. \\"In these times of heightened danger and trecherous deception, we must always go to the Lord for truth and direction. Christians following deceived leaders will only end up deceived themselves. We must always measure everything by the true Word of God. Seek the truth and you will find it. Knock and the door will be opened. Ask God in sincerity and in true faith, and He will give you the wisdom you need...May we always have a love of the truth. May God give us wisdom and spiritual discernment as we seek to contend for the faith.\\" (Page 180)<br /><br />Warren has written a book that is alarming, but not apocalyptic - a book that shows a love for the church and a godly concern for her welfare.

US	43519458	R2O2G0PTH89ELZ	1581344589	829818560	Total Truth: Liberating Christianity from Its Cultural Captivity	Books	5	30	35	N	Y	A Must-Read For Believers	I have often lamented the overuse of the term \\"life-changing\\" amongst Christians. It is not unusual to hear people walk away from a particularly captivating sermon or conference saying \\"that changed my life!\\" The real measure and test of life change is time, for only in time will we really know what has made a significant impact on our lives. Having established that I do not use the term lightly, I would like to suggest that Total Truth by Nancy Pearcey may just be a life-changing book. As believers we collectively spend millions of dollars and countless hours reading about Christian living - making our homes better, making our families better, making our lives better, discovering our purpose, rediscovering our masculine soul or our feminine soul and so on ad infinitum, ad nauseum. There are some who love to supplement with the study of theology or church history, and those are great pursuits. But if we buy so many books and read so much, why do we dedicate so little time to examining and studying worldview? I do not mean to indict the reader and clear my own name, for in all the reading I have done, this is the first book that deals predominantly with that topic.<br /><br />Total Truth is subtitled \\"Liberating Christianity from Its Cultural Captivity\\" and this is the task to which Pearcey dedicates the book. She shows how Christians have adopted a worldview that is bound and influenced by our culture, so that we now understand Christianity through a secular worldview. She teaches that the opposite needs to be true - that we need to see society through a distinctly Christian lens, allowing a Christian worldview to interpret all that we see, do and think. She says \\"This book will address [the hunger for a Christian worldview] and offers new direction for advancing the worldview movement. It will help you identify the secular/sacred divide that keeps your faith locked into the private sphere of 'religious truth.' It will walk you through practical, workable steps for crafting a Christian worldview in your own life and work. It will teach you how to apply a worldview grid to cut through the bewildering maze of ideas and ideologies we encounter in a postmodern world.\\" (Page 17) In short, the purpose of the book is to help Christians free their faith from its cultural captivity and to see that Christianity is not merely religious truth, but is Total Truth - truth about the whole of reality. \\"The purpose of a worldview is to explain our experience of the world-and any philosophy can be judged by how well it succeeds in doing so. When Christianity is tested, we discover that it alone explains and makes sense of the most basic and universal human experiences.\\"<br /><br />As a devotee of Francis Shaeffer, Pearcey borrows heavily from his writing and ideas. Most notably, she understands, as did Shaeffer, that Christians have mimicked the world in adopting a two-level worldview which she calls a fact/value split. It can be represented as follows:<br /><br />VALUES<br /><br />Individual Preferences<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />FACTS<br /><br />Binding on everyone<br /><br />In the upper level are values which are mere individual preferences and on the bottom level are facts which are binding on everyone. Facts represent knowledge drawn from and proven by science and in this way they are considered objective and rational. On the other hand, on the top level are values which are considered subjective and a product of tradition. Thus are not binding beyond the individual's conscience and are essentially irrational. They have little to say about reality. This split has pervaded all aspects of society.<br /><br />The thesis of this book is \\"the key to recovering joy and purpose turned out to be a new understanding of Christianity as total truth - an insight that broke open the dam and poured the restoring waters of the gospel into the parched areas of life.\\" The first step in recovering a Christian worldview is to understand thebifurcated worldview which is inherent in our postmodern world. Having understood that we have made false disctinctions between secular and sacred, we can begin integrating our faith into every area of life so that we bear a consistent witness throughout. Politicians are beginning to come to the realization that politics is downstream from culture. In order to change the politics of our nations, we must first influence the culture, and to do that we must reclaim a Christian worldview. \\"Ordinary Christians working in business, industry, politics, factory work, and so on, are 'the Church's front-line troops' in the spiritual battle. Are we taking seriously our duty to support them in their warfare? The church is nothing less than a training ground for sending out laypeople who are equipped to speak the gospel to the world.\\" That is the subject of the bulk of the book - training and sending laypeople who can share the Gospel with the world. Pearcey continually exposes those areas that have been polluted by a secular worldview and explains how Christians need to reclaim them.<br /><br />After Pearcey thoroughly deconstructed our society's postmodern worldview in the first few chapters of the book, I found I did not have as clear an idea as to how I could rebuild a Christian worldview. But perhaps this is because there are no easy answers - there is no happy W.O.R.L.D.V.I.E.W. acronym that will allow me to follow a 9-step program to worldview reconstruction. The key is to acknowledge the deficiency of holding a two-level worldview and by immersing myself in Scripture, allowing God to shape and mould me as He sees fit. A Christian worldview must necessarily flow from the study and application of God's Word. I need to understand and believe that Christian Truth is a unified whole, equally encompassing all of life.<br /><br />In reading books written by intellectuals, rather than pastors and teachers, I have often found that their theology is shaped more by the Catholic intellectuals of days past than by the Protestant theology. This is not the case for Pearcey. She strikes a good balance of praise and criticism in her presentation of Protestantism, generally defending the actions and motives of the Reformers and believers of history. Similarly she praises various Catholic scholars (such as Aquinas) for contributions they made, but is necessarily harsh when discussing their shortcomings. Throughout the book, the author maintains this important balance. It was wonderful to see that Pearcey presents significant, deep theology that clearly aligns with the Reformed understandings of the Scripture.<br /><br />I am in agreement with Al Mohler who said \\"Total Truth is one of the most promising books to emerge in evangelical publishing in many years. It belongs in every Christian home, and should quickly be put into the hands of every Christian young person. This important book should be part of the equipment for college or university study, and churches should use it as a textbook for Christian worldview development.\\" Pearcey has crafted a masterpiece that is intellectually stimulating but still accessible and practical. It will challenge, motivate and change. I give it my hearty recommendation.d worldview which is inherent in our postmodern world.

This book is all about the silence. Whether that silence is part of the religious practice of Buddhists, Hindus, Sufi Muslims, New Agers or Contemplative Christians, Ray Yungen, author of A Time of Departing argues convincingly that it is all one and the same. As the subtitle suggests, a universal spirituality is changing the very face of Christianity. This universal spirituality is born from the religions of the East and is slowly infiltrating the Christian church, primarily through the New Age movement. Ray Yungen has studied this religious movement extensively and writes this book in response. It is an alarm sounded by one with a deep love for the church. \\"This book is not just another attempt to explain the New Age, but rather, an alert to the church of how and through whom New Age thinking is currently creeping into our pulpits, Sunday school classrooms, prayer groups, and Bible studies.\\" The primary way the New Age has joined with the evangelical churches is through mysticism and contemplative prayer.<br /><br />Contemplative prayer has been practiced by professed Christians since the early days of the church. Once a practice known only to a few Catholic mystics, today it is quickly gaining popularity in both Catholic and Protestant circles. Many prominent Protestant leaders have endorsed the practice, either explicitly or by declaring their respect for those who teach it. Rick Warren, Bill Hybels and Robert Schuller, leaders of the church growth movement have all spoken favorably of it and have been involved in conferences where it is taught and practiced. The leaders of the Emergent church endorse the practice as a way of drawing closer to God. Many youth leaders and organizations have begun teaching it to children and teens. Catholic teachers such as Henri Nouwen and Brennan Manning, following in the footsteps of Thomas Merton, teach the value of the practice and are respected by Protestants and Catholics alike. Because of its increasing popularity, Christians need to educate themselves about the meaning and source of this practice.<br /><br />In the introduction Ron Comer writes, \\"like two rivers merging together, Easter and Western religious thought are joining together, thus gaining momentum towards a one world religion in which all paths lead to God. A person who understands the unfolding of this new paradigm is Ray Yungen.\\" (Page 15) Sure enough, contemplative prayer is a practice derived from the Eastern religions and is entirely foreign to Scripture. Those who practice it, allowing their minds to enter the silence of contemplation or meditation, open themselves to a practice that is foreign to the Bible, and even more serious, is completely opposed to biblical Christianity.<br /><br />These words are from the author's conclusion. \\"Let us be mindful that deception is subtle, and we must be alert. All of life and truth are resting on what God has proclaimed in the Scriptures. Any teaching not supported by the Bible is not of God. May you know in your heart and mind that you are not one of the deceived, and may you, with all your heart, show your love for God by loving His Living Word. And finally, may you press on towards the upward call of God and be found ready - for there will indeed be a time of departing! This book will prepare you to avoid deception and will sharpen you, that you may not be one who departs from the faith. It is short, at 137 pages, and is easy to read. Perhaps its greatest quality is that it is biblical, continually turning to the Scriptures to allow God's Word to bear witness against Contemplative practices. It is alarming without being alarmist. I recommend it to all believers - those involved in these practices and those who would like to know more about the dangers.larity, Christians need to educate themselves about the meaning and source of this practice. <br /> <br />In the introduction Ron Comer writes, \\"like two rivers merging together, Easter and Western religious thought are joining together, thus gaining momentum towards a one world religion in which all paths lead to God.

Perhaps its greatest quality is that it is biblical, continually turning to the Scriptures to allow God's Word to bear witness against Contemplative practices. It is alarming without being alarmist. I recommend it to all believers - those involved in these practices and those who would like to know more about the dangers.	2005-01-14

With its leather-looking cover, rough-cut pages, gold lettering and marbled inside pages, it looks like a wonderful, valuable, antique book. Truth be told, I probably would not have purchased it were it not for that cover. I am not so shallow that I would purchase it based soley on the cover, but a great cover and an author I respect are too much for me to pass up.<br /><br />In this book, MacArthur provides his spin on a topic that is gaining prominence in the church. I suspect the books published on the subject of leadership in the church in the past five years would by far outnumber thoese published in the prior 2000 years of Christianity. Leadership has become a buzz-word, and leadership skills are more highly-valued by many than the ability to write good sermons, to relate to people or to express clear doctrine. For many people today a pastor's role should primarily concern leadership with the preaching of the Word taking on a secondary role. In this context I looked forward to gleaning from the wisdom of John MacArthur.<br /><br />This book is based around the apostle Paul (rather than Nehemiah, who seems to be the subject of many leadership manuals), drawing lessons about leadership through two of the situations he faced: his time in prison and his time pastoring the church at Corinth. I was surprised to find that the leadership principles outlined by the author are not expositorily drawn out of the Scripture, for expository teaching is what we have come to expect from MacArthur. Instead, he uses Paul's life to point to principles of leadership. For example, the sixth principle of leadership is that a leader is optimistic and enthusiastic. MacArthur shows this in Paul's life by referencing Acts 27:25 where the apostle tells the men aboard his doomed ship to \\"take heart ... for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.\\" There are twenty six of these principles introduced in similar fashion throughout the text.<br /><br />While the book does a respectable job of introducing principles of leadership, I found its primary value in serving as a commentary on portions of the books of Acts and Corinthians. MacArthur is a skilled expositor and does deep research in the Scriptures. Thus he brings to light many situations and tidbits of information that helped me better understand these passages of the Bible and to understand Paul. Reading the book purely as a commentary will be rewarding in itself, with the principles of leadership serving as icing on the cake.<br /><br />I have to admit I found this book a little disappointing, primarily because it was not entirely expository in nature. The twenty six principles of leadership are sound and will no doubt serve to strengthen many future and current leaders. In the final analysis, though, while they are proven from the life of Paul, they were not drawn explicitly from Scripture. Despite that, a man who exhibited those qualities would no doubt be an godly man and one well-suited and eminently qualfied for leadership in the church. I do recommend this book both as a commentary on parts of the life of Paul and as a guide to important qualities necessary for godly leadership.been told.\\" There are twenty six of these principles introduced in similar fashion throughout the text.<br /><br />While the book does a respectable job of introducing principles of leadership, I found its primary value in serving as a commentary on portions of the books of Acts and Corinthians.

Nicholas was at the same time excellent and disappointing. The disappointment was my fault and in no way reflects upon the book or the author, for I had begun reading it with unfair expectations. I had not read the cover carefully and thus I thought I was buying a short biography of Edwards and that is not what this book is. After I came to realize what the book was intended to be, I enjoyed it thoroughly. And in this way it was excellent. Despite not being a biography it contained all sorts of great information about Edwards and about the events and writings that shaped his life. It is, as it says in the title, a guided tour to his life and thoughts more than a chronological ordering of the events of his life. More than a biography, this is a gateway into the thoughts, writings and theology of this great man of God.<br /><br />In the introduction Nichols writes that the book \\"is not an end in itself; it is not a substitute for reading Edwards. It is intended to help anyone who, like me, has wanted to read Edwards and even has tried to read him, but needs a little help.\\" It might also be said that this book is not a substitute for reading a thorough biography of the man. Later Nicholas says \\"My hope is that this book will help you to see the relevance and importance of Edward's thought and that through these pages Edwards will help you, as he has helped so many others, to better understand God, his Word, his work in this world, and your place in it.\\" In this regard, the book and the author succeed admirably.<br /><br />The format of the book is as follows. It is divided into four sections. The first section, comprising two chapters is dedicated to a short overview of his life, from his upbringing in a Christian home to his untimely death from a failed smallpox innoculation. The following three parts, each comprised of three or four chapters, examine his writings and sermons. Part two examines his writings on revival and church life, part three his writings on theology and philosophy and part four several of his sermons. Each is presented in the appropriate historical context and is examined in light of the impact it had in his day and in its ongoing relevance to the church today.<br /><br />This book is a solid entry-level introduction to Jonathan Edwards, and in particular, to his contribution to Christian thought and theology. I give it my recommendation, not as an alternative to his writings or biographies, but, as it was meant to be, a supplement.his writings on revival and church life, part three his writings on theology and philosophy and part four several of his sermons.

In short, it is awful.  I consider it, in terms of content, one of the worst I have ever read and it stands as damning evidence of what passes for Christian reading in our day.  Though it was easy to read, and even enjoyable at times, throughout the text Brian McLaren has consistently, deliberately and systematically dismantled historical Protestantism.  From Sola Scriptura to hell to biblical inerrancy, nothing is sacred.  At this point, those who are devotees of McLaren, The Emergent Church and post-modernism, will no doubt already have felt their blood boil and will be ready for a fight.  I would encourage those people to keep reading.  Those who are more traditional Christians will be grappling with an all-too-familiar feeling that this book represents yet another attack on the faith.  And that is exactly what this book is.  The remainder of this review will concern itself with showing how this book does away with biblical faith, replacing it with something far less godly and far more human. In short, something that is simply not Christianity.<br /><br />It is difficult to critique the writing of people like McLaren because discerning what they actually believe is far more difficult than finding what they do not believe.  Settling on those beliefs is akin to nailing Jello to the wall - it is a near impossible task as the Jello has no consistent form or shape, always changing, always conforming to what contains it.  We are often left to read between the lines, interpreting what the author believes in light of what he rejects.<br /><br />Upon reading the description on the back cover, I immediately became curious as to what McLaren's authority will be.  As he examines the wide divergence of traditions with Christianity, how will he decide which to hold on to, which to cast aside and which to adopt as his own?  Will he test all things in the light of Scripture and follow Paul's directive to Titus to \\"teach what accords with sound doctrine\\" or will he rely instead on his own wisdom and experience?  It does not take long for the answer to become clear. His generous orthodoxy will not be a biblical orthodoxy for it does not begin and end with Scripture. He does not weigh each and every doctrine or experience by the Word of God. In his concluding chapter he tells us \\"To be a Christian in a generously orthodox way is not to claim to have truth captured, stuffed and mounted on the wall.\\"  Parenthetically, I would like to point out that this is an irrational statement, for I know of no Christians who would make the claim that he has arrived at absolute truth in every area of doctrine.  We will continue with McLaren who says that orthodoxy is a \\"loving community of people who are seeking truth on the road of mission and who have been launched on the quest by Jesus, who, with us, guides us still.\\"  Again, notice that he refuses to acknowledge that perhaps we have captured much of objective truth through the Scripture.  Orthodoxy is \\"a way of seeing and seeking, a way of living, a way of thinking and loving and learning that helps what we believe become more true over time, more resonant with the infinite glory that is God.\\"  So to McLaren, orthodoxy is thinking or opinion, not doctrine.  Furthermore, it becomes \\"more true\\" over time.  How can something be more or less true?  It is either true or false, unless of course, one is fully absorbed in the relevatism of postmodernism.<br /><br />Here are a few random observations:<br /><br />He builds and then refutes straw-man arguments.  He continually paints things in the worst possible light, often in a completely false light, and then seeks to be profound in refuting those arguments.  This was most notable to me in his discussion of Calvinism.  He presented beliefs no true Calvinist adheres to and then proceeded to show that the false view was wrong. Ironically, on page 135 he criticizes both liberals and conservatives for continually comparing \\"their own best to their counterpart's worst\\" yet that very spirit pervades this book.<br /><br />He proves nothing.  Time and time again he mentions facts, especially from history, with no attempt whatsoever to prove them true. He gives no context, no proof, no particulars and no citations. I suspect many of his readers have as little knowledge as he does of history, especially Reformational history, and will thus believe what he says, regardless of its truthfulness.<br /><br />He is so nice.  Those of us who are concerned far more with truth, and by that I refer to God's truth as outlined in Scripture, are rarely as nice as McLaren.  We are forced to call sin sin.  We are forced to reject much of what other people value, treasure and believe.  We unapologetically reject what does not adhere to Scriptural models.  McLaren and other Emergent leaders are always so nice, accepting everything and politely, though often sarcastically, rejecting Truth.  What chance to Protestant apologists have against such niceness?  Yet it does not matter, for foolishness in the eyes of man is wisdom in the eyes of God.  God be true though every man be a liar!<br /><br />In the end I have to reject this book as being something entirely different than Christian.  It portrays some sort of faith modelled loosely on aspects of Christianity, but there is far more error than truth.  McLaren has proven himself to be just one more in a long line of \\"Christian\\" leaders leading people away from Scripture and away from the absolute Truth it contains.  Of course McLaren can always claim that we, the old-fashioned, non-Emergent Protestants, just don't get it; that somehow we are so absorbed in our modernism that we cannot make the transition to the new realities of our society.  But with others, I am committed to the Bible and to remaining under God's authority.<br /><br />Having read McLaren's statement of faith, I can see little evidence that he understands or accepts even the basic tenets of the faith.  I do not doubt McLaren's niceness, kindness or even his desire to see the church Reformed for the better.  But his generous orthodoxy is far removed from true Christianity.  Christians need to reject this book and reject McLaren as a leader and teacher as long as he continues to espouse such views.  I would call upon him to repent of his arrogance in rejecting God's authority and to return in submission to our Lord.ost notable to me in his discussion of Calvinism.

It is also practical, having been based on the author's own experience in being what he refers to as an illuminist - a person who, when confronted by difficult decisions in life, seeks guidance from God by getting a series of impressions which he believes come as God directly impacts the spirit. This belief is taught by most evangelical leaders today, though perhaps the most notable of these is Richard Blackaby in his book Experiencing God. While Elliff does not rule out such forms of communication altogether, he does teach that there is no reason to believe that such means of communication are normative for Christians today. These types of communication are inherently subjective, meaning that there can always be an element of doubt in the recipients mind about whether he really heard God's voice or merely his own mind. A quote from George Whitefield is helpful to understand this: \\"God may use the sincere individual who gets his guidance the illuminist's way. He may bless him. He may honour his faith more than his method. I am quite sure that God always condescends to our imperfections. And if there is immaturity, we must realize that God will often use in our zealous immaturity what he disallows in our maturity...The Great Awakening preacher, George Whitefield (1714-1770), who had such tendencies in his earlier days, later commented, \\"I am a man of like passions with others, and consequently may have sometimes mistaken nature for grace, imagination for revelation.\\" He put away his illuministic patterns as he grew in Christ. Yet, it is important to note that he was used in those earlier days just as dramatically as in later life.\\" (page 35)<br /><br />The author concludes that we are to submit any impressions we may have to Scripture which is the only infallible guide we have been given by God. Scripture contains all we need to make decisions in life and to know what God's will is for us. The most important concept in the book \\"sanctified reasoning\\" which is where we, as increasingly sanctified followers of Christ, make decisions based on the Word of God. The Holy Spirit who indwells us and is continually renewing our will, helps us make decisions that honor and glorify God. Rather than trust in impressions and voices, we are to trust the Spirit's work in the mind and will.<br /><br />The book is only 46 pages long and is written at a level that even young people and new believers will be comfortable with. I highly recommend it. In the same vein I also recommend Decisions, Decisions by Dave Swavely and Guidance And The Voice of God by Jensen and Payne.ains all we need to make decisions in life and to know what God's will is for us.

While it continues to be a minority position, it is gaining wider acceptance and several popular Christian authors are teaching it or teaching principles derived from it, even while denying their belief in it. This represents one of the battle-lines of the contemporary church and it is important for Christians to know what this doctrine teaches and be prepared to give a defense of the traditional view of God. This short book, written by Bruce Ware, sets out to teach believers the basics of what they need to know to defend the traditional doctrines.<br /><br />Put simply, open theism is a doctrine that teaches that God does not fully know the future, for he cannot see what humans will do with the free will He gives them. Therefore, God has taken a great risk in giving us freedom. Of course this contrasts with the biblical teaching of God's omniscience - that He sees and knows everything in the past, present and future - as well as God's omnipotence - that He not only knows these things, but controls them as well. More than just a minor difference in doctrine, open theism threatens some of the beliefs Christians hold most dear. How can we have confidence in a God who does not know what will happen minutes, hours or days from now? How can we trust a God who is constantly making errors in judgment as He guides our lives the best He can, using only the information that He is able to see at the time? Why should we pray to a God who values our opinion as highly as our own? This is not the God of the Bible! As the title of the book tells us, the God of open theism is too small, having been created in the image of man.<br /><br />Their God Is Too Small introduces the main proponents of open theism, explains the basics of their beliefs and shows the implications of this doctrine. The author concludes that open theism undermines the believer's confidence in God as the One who can be trusted to walk with us through pain and suffering; as the one who gives us a hope for the future. The constant theme is that this God is just far too small to be the God we learn of from the Scriptures.<br /><br />This book, at only 129 pages, serves merely as an introduction to this doctrine, but it serves that purpose well. It is easy to read and understand, even for those who know little about theology. The reader will be left with an accurate depiction of the arguments for and against this doctrine as well as a strong sense of just what is at stake. I am glad to give it my recommendation.as the One who can be trusted to walk with us through pain and suffering; as the one who gives us a hope for the future.

The problem is not that it is a poor book but more that I had unrealistic expectations of it. I was hoping this book would be everything the church growth manuals are not; that it would be a knockout punch against church growth. It is not all of this, but that does not mean it is without value. I suppose I expected it to be a rebuttal of the seeker-friendly/church growth movement, but this is not what it is inteded to be. In retrospect, this is far better, for the book begins and ends with the Bible and the wisdom of God rather than with a rebuttal of the the wisdom of men. This book represents an interesting contrast to other books on this topic that have emerged from the Southern Baptist Convention, most notably The Purpose Driven Church. Where Warren's book claims to be about church health it is clear that the true focus is on growth. In 9 Marks, Mark Dever is able to seperate health from growth, rules from results. The focus of this book is on \\"being\\" church rather than \\"doing\\" church - on accentuating biblical perspectives on personal holiness above numbers or cultural relevance.<br /><br />The author, Mark Dever, is pastor of Capitol Hill Baptist Church, a Southern Baptist congregation in Washington, D.C., and also heads up IX Marks Ministries. Dever seems to be anything but typical as a Southern Baptist pastor, and with his thoroughly Reformed theology must represent a minority position within the Convention. In this book, as in IX Marks Ministries, he seeks to rediscover the pillars of the church as outlined in the Bible and practiced in traditional Protestant churches. Here is a brief overview of the 9 marks he identifies:<br /><br />  1. Expositional Preaching - Expositional preaching (otherwise known as expository preaching) is the investigation of a particular passage of Scripture whereby the pastor carefully explains the meaning of a passage and then applies it to the members of the congregation. The point of a sermon, then, takes the point of a particular passage. This is in opposition to the topical preaching showcased in the majority of evangelical churches, where Bible passages are woven together to support a pre-existing point.<br /><br />  2. Biblical Theology - This emphasizes not only how we are taught but also what we are taught. In a sense this should follow naturally from expository preaching because the careful exposition of a passage should lead to sound theology. The majority of poor theology arises from a lack of careful Biblical exposition. Where there is poor exposition, we should expect to eventually find poor theology.<br /><br />  3. Biblical Understanding of the Good News - There needs to be a proper understanding and necessary emphasis on the full gospel. Where many contemporary churches teach that Jesus wants to meet our felt needs and give us a healthier self-image, that is not the gospel. The gospel message is that we are sinners who have rebelled against our Creator. But Jesus took the curse that was rightfully ours and all that remains is for us to have faith in Him so God may credit Christ's righteousness to our account. When we de-emphasize sin and damnation to make the presentation more friendly and less offensive we cease declaring the full gospel.<br /><br />  4. Biblical Understanding of Conversion - When we have a Biblical understanding of the gospel, we must then also have a proper understanding of conversion. Conversion is a new birth from death to life and is a work of God. It is not merely a change of attitude or a change of affection, but a change of nature. Conversion does not need to be an exciting, emotional experience, but does need to produce fruit to be judged a true conversion.<br /><br />  5. Biblical Understanding of Evangelism - The way we evangelize speaks volumes about how we understand conversion (and further, what we understand about the good news). If we believe that people are essentially good and are seeking Jesus, we evangelize using half truths and tend to elicit false conversions. When we present a watered-down gospel, we end up with a watered-down church. We need to be faithful to present the full gospel, the good news with the bad, and leave the results to God.<br /><br />  6. Biblical Understanding of Membership - Church membership is a privilege and a responsibility and needs to be regarded as such. People should only be members if they are dedicated to the church - in attendance, prayer, service and giving. To allow people to become and remain members for sentimental or other unbiblical reasons makes light of membership and may even be dangerous.<br /><br />  7. Biblical Church Discipline - Discipline guides church membership. The church has the responsibility to judge the life and teaching of the membership since they can negatively impact the church's witness of the gospel. Leadership need to be firm in discipline as this is an expression of love to the congregation.<br /><br />  8. Promotion of Church Discipleship And Growth - We need to recover true discipleship - discipleship that causes Christians to live lives of increasing holiness. The emphasis on growth needs to be directed at holiness rather than membership. True discipleship producing strong, committed Christians will present a clear witness to the world.<br /><br />  9. Biblical Understand of Leadership - Until recent times, almost all Protestants agreed that in church government there should be a plurality of elders (which means that there should be an office of elder and not merely one or more pastors in positions of leadership). This is a Biblical and practical model that has fallen out of favor in modern times.<br /><br />Dever presents a convincing argument that a return to each of these nine principles would do much to restore the church to what God intends her to be. He dedicates twenty or thirty pages to each of them, usually tracing how they were understood in church history and showing the effect they would have on today's church. Perhaps what I appreciated most about this book is that, while he is willing to share from his own ministry, this is not a \\"do as I have done\\" type of book. Never once does he tell us how many people attend his church, trying to woo us with human credentials. All we learn about the numbers in his church is that membership decreased, but attendance increased as a result of his pastorate. Very rarely does he portray himself as the model other church leaders are to emulate. Needless to say, this stands in stark contrast to other books written to address the same topic.<br /><br />So while this book left me a little bit disappointed, I realize that it was my unrealistic expectations that made it so. This is a very well-written and thoroughly biblical book. Dever expounds God's wisdom on the church and in that way does exactly what he set out to do - he provides godly insight into what makes a healthy, vibrant church that pleases our Lord. I highly recommend it.nd are seeking Jesus, we evangelize using half truths and tend to elicit false conversions. When we present a watered-down gospel, we end up with a watered-down church.

Dever expounds God's wisdom on the church and in that way does exactly what he set out to do - he provides godly insight into what makes a healthy, vibrant church that pleases our Lord. I highly recommend it.	2004-12-15

Though I have never met him, Garry Gilley has had a signficant impact on my life.  He was one of two people who was most influential in my decision to begin to review books.  His many book reviews were very helpful to me and made me realize that if he could review books and post them on the web, I could too.  I have long wanted to read his books and just recently was given a copy of This Little Church Went to Market.<br /><br />This book is a damning indictment of the market-driven churches that are so popular today.  Having extensively studied the issues Gilley writes about in this book, I am comfortable saying that this is the best introduction to \\"the church in the age of entertainment\\" that I have read.  Gilley contends that the church has sold out to our culture so that the influences of the culture have become the influences in the church.  The most significant forces pressing against the church are entertainment, market driven philosophies and psychology.  These three are largely absent from the Bible, yet are startlingly prevalent in evangelical churches.  The leaders and issues he concentrates on most are Rick Warren and his book The Purpose Driven Church, Bill Hybels and Lee Strobel.<br /><br />Having discussed the forces that are impacting the church, the author spends several chapters examining how these forces have impacted evangelical churches.  He quotes extensively throughout the book from other believers who have covered this topic such as John MacArthur, Os Guinness and Michael Horton as well as from unbelievers such as Neal Postman.  Finally he concludes that churches built on seeker sensitive model will be built on the wrong foundation, will teach the wrong message, will focus on the wrong need and will misunderstand preaching and worship.  In other words, these churches will bear little resemblance to a New Testament, Christian church.<br /><br />Through this book Gilley manages to approach the topics in a rational manner and never comes across as being obnoxious or blinded to the heart of the issues.  He truly does understand both the New Testament model and the new evangelical model and is able to adequately compare them.  The back cover tells us that the book \\"is a call for the Church to return to its scriptural roots\\" and that is right on the mark.  This book examines contemporay issues and calls the church to return to the source to discover what God would have us be.

A few years ago I read an article written by an unbeliever and published in a major newspaper where she questioned how Christians could simply disregard this commandment. Her conclusion was that it was mere disobedience - that Christians disregarded the commandment simply because following it would conflict with our lifestyles. Was she on to something, or did she merely misunderstand the relationship of the Old Testament to the New - a very common problem with believers and unbelievers alike?<br /><br />Call The Sabbath A Delight is the first book I have read dedicated entirely to the subject of Sabbath observance in the post Old Testament era. I have read bits and pieces of information regarding why we should or should not continue to honor the fourth commandment, but never a book-length treatment. This particular book is written by a Presbyterian pastor and published by Banner of Truth which should give a pretty good indication of which side the author will take. He represents the view that I was raised with. I was raised in a Presbyterian home and attended Reformed schools and churches and was continually admonished to keep the Sabbath holy. I spent one year of my life in Scotland and there we were taught that we were not even to play with friends on Sunday, but were instead to read our Bibles and study our Catechisms. While the author, Walter Chandry, may not be that strict, he clearly believes that Christians have abandoned a practice which we need to rediscover out of obedience to God.<br /><br />A common argument against observing the Sabbath in our time is that Christ did away with the moral Law when He died for us. Underlying this observation is a belief or assumption that the Sabbath was somehow a burdensome obligation for God's people, but nothing could be farther from the truth. The Sabbath was a creation ordinance, for even in a perfect world God rested on the seventh day and declared it as being set apart to Him. So when we examine this issue we need to do so free from a bias that the Sabbath was an obligation. On the contrary it was a wonderful privilege, given by a loving God. Any harm that befell the day was the fault of sinful humans who are adept at turning anything wonderful into something burdensome.<br /><br />The author covers the following topics:<br /><br />  1. The Commandment is Holy<br /><br />  2. The Commandment is Spiritual<br /><br />  3. The Commandment is Good<br /><br />  4. Does the NT Teach the 4th Commandment?<br /><br />  5. Sabbath Observance: Mosaic and Christian<br /><br />  6. Motives for Sabbath-Keeping<br /><br />  7. Which Day of the Week in the Sabbath?<br /><br />  8. Difficult Cases of Conscience<br /><br />I will leave you to read his arguments on your own if the topic interests you. His conclusion is that the Sabbath, as a creation ordinance, continues to this day so that God requires that we continue to honor it even today. \\"No age has ever more intensely needed Sabbath-keeping than ours. Attempts to scrap God's moral law and to replace it with institutions and schemes of human invention are miserably failing. Sabbath-keeping in isolation is not an answer to all man's ills. Yet, this law is intimately related to all others and has a necessary connection with the other branches of God's moral code. Where even small segments of mankind have succeeded in implementing a joyful observance of the Sabbath, they have reaped enormous benefit. It is time for us, too, to call the Sabbath a delight and to return unto the Lord.\\"<br /><br />While his arguments are compelling, I am not sure that they are strong enough to convict the evangelical who has never even considered that the Sabbath may extend to our day. His argument is valuable, though, for it represents theview held by many Presbyterian and Reformed believers. Their belief is one which many, if not the majority, of Christians held until recent times.ny Presbyterian and Reformed believers. Their belief is one which many, if not the majority, of Christians held until recent times.	2004-12-03

Most of the largest and seemingly most successful mission organizations were founded by Arminians and continue to be based around Arminian theology.  Arminian churches seem to grow much faster than churches based on Calvinist principles.  It seems that part of the reason for this is that Calvinists have such a high view of God's sovereignty that it is easy for them to assume that there is no reason for Christians to evangelize.  After all, if God truly is sovereign, if He does control absolutely everything, what reason is there to evangelize?  If God has ordained someone will be saved, they reason, that person will be saved regardless of my efforts.  Perhaps evangelism is even sinful, for is it possible that it actually denies God's sovereignty?<br /><br />It is against this backdrop that J.I. Packer wrote Evangelism & The Sovereignty of God, a classic study on the relationship between God's sovereignty and the necessity of evangelism.  A short but exceedingly powerful book, Packer shows that rather than precluding evangelism, God's sovereignty provides the most powerful incentive and support for it.<br /><br />Packer begins by presenting the concept of antinomy, which he defines as \\"an appearance of contradiction between conclusions which seem equally logical, reasonable or necessary.\\"  An antinomy we face as believers is that of God's sovereignty and human responsibility.  Somehow, although God is absolutely sovereign, He has ordained that we would be responsible for our involvement in His plans.  Our obedient response to this antinomy is to accept it for what it is and learn to live with it.  Any other response would be to minimize something God deems important and even necessary to a godly life.  We cannot see Divine sovereignty and human responsible as opposites or principles that are in conflict with each other, but rather as principles that complement each other and are equally true.<br /><br />The author turns to a lengthy discussion of evangelism where he defines what evangelism is and what it is not.  He speaks of the message of evangelism as well as the motive and means for it.  He concludes with an examination of how God's sovereignty affects evangelism.  Packer's conclusion is that \\"We would not wish to say that man cannot evangelize at all without coming to terms with this doctrine [God's sovereignty]; but we venture to think that, other things being equal, he will be able to evangelize better for believing it.\\"<br /><br />For a book weighing in at a mere 126 pages, this one contains impressive depth and contains a thorough and satisfying treatment of the subject.

That this book was written by John MacArthur and the faculty of Master's seminary is a strong endorsement of its value, for that institution is known as being one that upholds the value of expositional teaching.  I hoped also that I would learn some techniques and disciplines that would enrich my personal Bible study as well as my writing.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Effective exposition of the Bible requires four steps and each of these receives careful analysis in this book.  The steps are:<br /><br />-Personal preparation.  This involves ensuring that the expositor is walking with the Lord.  He must be dedicated to studying the Word and to prayer as well as other spiritual disciplines.  Proper exposition cannot be done apart from the Spirit who alone can illumine the text.<br /><br />-Processing the Biblical text.  This involves using study tools, engaging in hermeneutics and exegesis and generally drawing the meaning from the text in a biblical manner.<br /><br />-Pulling the message together.  This involves determining the central ideas of a text and drawing up an outline.  It involves an effective introduction and conclusion and moving from exegesis to exposition.<br /><br />-Preaching the exposition.  This involves actually delivering the message in an effective manner.<br /><br />Each of these steps is explained in sufficient, though not burdensome detail.  Nine authors combined to write the nineteen chapters, and while some are more effective communicators than others, each does a good job of handling his topic.<br /><br />While this book is clearly aimed at the aspiring pastor or to pastors who are attempting to make their messages expository, there is still value in reading it for people who are not pastors.  Many of the principles of hermeneutics and exegesis are important for all believers to understand thoroughly in order to effectively interpret and apply the Word of God.  While not all of the information will pertain to these readers, those parts can be passed over without losing the value of the book.<br /><br />I recommend this book for the targeted audience (pastors and aspiring pastors) but also for lay people who are interested in learning Biblical methods of hermeneutics and exegesis.  That being said, there are other options that may be better-suited for these people, such as How To Interpret the Bible For Yourself by Richard Mayhue.nciples of hermeneutics and exegesis are important for all believers to understand thoroughly in order to effectively interpret and apply the Word of God.

While some of these leave much to be desired, many of them are excellent and do justice to the topic.  One might ask, then, why someone would want to write (or read) yet another one, and that would be a fair question.<br /><br />What attracted me to this title is that it was the final book written by one of our generation's great pastors and teachers, James Montgomery Boice.  Having been diagnosed with cancer and knowing that he had merely a few months or weeks to live, he dedicated himself to hymn-writing and to writing this book.  He lived for a mere forty two days after receiving his diagnosis, and though he was not able to see it to completion, he turned it over to his colleague Philip Ryken who completed it after Boice's death.  In the foreward R.C. Sproul writes of Boice: \\"Here was a man who not only believed in the doctrines of grace but also loved those doctrines and had fire in his bones about propagating them.  I knew Jim Boice for more than thirty years and never saw that fire diminish. His soul was held captive by the doctrines of grace. His ministry was an ongoing doxology to the doctrines of grace because they so clearly manifest the God of that grace...It is not surprising that the last literary work of James Boice would focus on his first love, the doctrines of grace.\\"  This book, then, contains the last words of an eminent pastor, theologian and teacher who dedicated his life to the very topic at hand.  It would be foolish for us to disregard such a message.<br /><br />The book begins with an examination of the current state of the evangelical world and traces some of the history of Calvinism and great Calvinists of the past.  The reader is introduced to Arminianism and sees how the two systems of doctrine are at odds.  We see how a rediscovery of the doctrines of grace is the antidote to the current sorry state of evangelicalism.<br /><br />The author then moves to an in-depth examination of each of the five doctrines of grace.  Eschewing the traditional TULIP acronym, Boice chooses instead to speak of Radical Depravity, Unconditional Election, Particular Redemption, Efficacious Grace and Persevering Grace.  Each of the points receives a full examination, but one that is targeted at the layperson so that even a young person or someone with little theological background could easily understand.  Each of the points is supported with Scripture and even the passages that seem to contradict the doctrines are examined and dealt with.  As one would expect, the Arminian opposites of each doctrine are considered as well.<br /><br />The final two chapters speak of rediscovering God's grace.  Calvinism is not a system of doctrine that impacts only the mind.  While it is based on theological distinctions, this theology should spur us to action.  One who considers himself Calvinist but sees no reason to take the gospel to the world or to be involved in the betterment of society has not truly understood the words of God.  The true Calvinist should be a leader in issues of evangelism and social justice.<br /><br />This book provides a beautiful and captivating introduction to Calvinism.  Combined with Boice's prior volume Whatever Happened To The Gospel of Grace one receives a solid introduction to the doctrines of grace and to the five solas of the Reformation.  I recommend this book as heartily as I recommended Whatever Happened to the Gospel of Grace.  Both are excellent studies and deserve to be read and appreciated.r />  <br />The author then moves to an in-depth examination of each of the five doctrines of grace.

He is uniquely qualified to write such a book as he is intimately familiar with the arguments against the Bible's sufficiency.  The book comes at a time when much of Protestantism has lost sight of this doctrine and has been slowly denying it.  White defines this doctrine as \\"Scripture alone as the sole infallible rule of faith for the church.\\"  Thus he teaches that Scripture has been given to govern and guide what we believe and why we believe it and is the only guide that can do so infallibly.  He has written this book to \\"lay a foundation for all Christians who desire a deeper understanding of biblical sufficiency\\" (from the back cover).  The book is targeted not at theologians and apologists, but at laypeople who are interested in being able to defend their faith and have firm convictions regarding the Scriptures.<br /><br />The book explores the themes of the Bible's accuracy, authority and authenticity.  Interestingly, much of the book takes the form of dialogues between a Protestant believer and a Catholic or Mormon apologist.  That should go to prove that this book is not targeted at intellectuals and theologians, though I have little doubt White has the knowledge to write such a book.  I found the dialogues a very helpful way of explaining difficult issues in a \\"could happen\\" type of environment.  While the dialogue itself is sometimes almost comical (when was the last time you spoke to someone on the subway and said \\"Ever considered that the primitive Christian church was hardly in a position to be chasing down copies of pseudepigraphical gospels penned by their enemies?\\") the content is helpful.  I may not use \\"pseudepigraphical\\" in conversation, but I can certainly apply the content of that conversation to someone who believes that The Da Vinci Code is a legitimate historical work.<br /><br />Among the issues White discusses are: the nature of God's Word, Inerrancy and exegesis, the canon of Scripture, apocryphal books, corruption and contradiction and scriptural sufficiency.  He also includes a short section on \\"the Lord spoke to me\\" where he shows how people who believe God continues to speak to them apart from Scripture deny scriptural sufficiency.  While none of the topics is covered in great detail, they all receive enough attention to explain what they are and how they relate to the defense of sola scriptura.  There were not any chapters that became bogged down in detail and theological nuances - they were all straightforward and easy to read.<br /><br />White has written a passionate introduction to the doctrine of the Bible's sufficiency.  This is a book that any Christian, even one with little theological background, should be able to read and enjoy.  The doctrines of sola scriptura are under attack from both outside the church and within.

Guidance and the Voice of God is one of several books I have read recently that discusses the way God speaks to and guides His children.  I have turned to these books in response to the words I hear all around me in modern Christianity.  People continually ask God to speak to us in circumstances and situations.  I am often asked how God spoke to me during a period of time or perhaps during a specific event.  The terms people use would seem to indicate that many of them hear audibly from God on an ongoing basis and that such revelation from God is normative for the Christian life.  Yet I have been a Christian for many years and have never received a \\"word from the Lord\\" and have never had a vision, dream or whispering that I can attribute to God.<br /><br />Phillip Jensen and Tony Payne, authors of Guidance and the Voice of God believe that God has spoken to us fully and finally through the Bible and that this is the only way we should expect for Him to speak to us.  They make five propositions about how God guides us:<br /><br />-God, in His sovereignty, uses everything to guide us \\"behind the scenes.\\"<br /><br />-In many and varied ways, God can speak to his people, and guide them with their conscious cooperation.<br /><br />-In these last days, God has spoken to us by His Son.<br /><br />-God speaks to us today by His Son through His Spirit in the Scriptures.<br /><br />-Apart from His Spirit working through Scripture, God does not promise to use any other means to guide us, nor should we expect Him to.<br /><br />While God has often used many supernatural means to speak to His people in former times, these are relegated to the past now that He has given us the Scriptures.  While He is still capable of revealing Himself however He wishes, the way He has chosen to do so is by the Spirit working through the Scriptures.  This argument is based primarily in the writings of Hebrews which provides ample support.<br /><br />A good part of the book is dedicated to decision making, and the authors propose a three-fold means of determining what to do when \\"matters matter.\\"  First, they speak of matters of righteousness.  If the Scripture tells us explicitly what to do or what not to do, we should instantly and joyfully obey.  This is a simple matter of obedience and we must realize that God will never ask us to disobey Him, for He is not the author of confusion.  Second, there are matters of good judgment.  When we have already determined that an action is not expressly forbidden, we may have to choose between two \\"right\\" options.  The example they use is marriage - we are told that celibacy is honorable and that marriage is also part of God's plan.  So when it comes to the choice of whether or not to marry, we must evaluate ourselves, our sexual appetites and determine what the Bible tells us.  These decisions rely on Biblical wisdom which can be gained only through diligently studying the Word.  Finally, there are matters of triviality, which are minor matters that are not worth worrying about.  Either do them or don't, but do not concern yourself with them.  Where some people become obsessed with trivialities, the authors encourage us to focus instead on the greater matters.<br /><br />One important aspect of the authors' argument involves the idea of God's will for our lives.  While many Christians today seem to believe that God has a specific plan for us that we may well miss out on if we make poor decisions, the authors show that this is not the case.  God has mapped out our lives so that all our decisions will lead to the ultimate goal, which is becoming increasingly conformed to the image of Christ.  We do not need to fear that one wrong decision will relegate us to a life of second best - to God's backup plan for those who do not obey.  In this view they teach that the Scripture is not to be treated like a map that will tell us when to turn left and when to turn right, but as a compass which will continually guide us in the direction of godliness.<br /><br />The book concludes with three case studies which take the theory the authors have taught and seek to put it into practice.  This is quite helpful as it makes the theoretical practical in at least a fictional setting.<br /><br />I have a couple of concerns with the book.  While the authors clearly state that other means of revelation, such as dreams, feelings, desires and external affirmations are not God's way of guiding us, they do not take a stance on what they might be.  Are these Satan's ways of trying to lead us astray, or merely circumstances?  I would have liked to have some teaching on what my pastor calls \\"spiritual impressions.\\"  Are we to interpret desires as coming from our own hearts, or does the Spirit begin to change our goals and desires as part of His guidance.<br /><br />Guidance and the Voice of God is well-written and easy to understand, even for a young believer.  The authors provide godly wisdom and what they share will surely allow many Christians to escape the snares inherent in thinking that we can miss out on God's will simply by laboring over decisions, but making wrong ones.  I highly recommend this book.

They are often, perhaps even primarily, unnoticed as we have become so attuned to them.  Where God tells us to worship Him as the Creator, all paganism is based on somehow worshipping creation.  Peter Jones has written this little book, Gospel Truth / Pagan Lies to show some of the many pagan influences in our society.  He contrasts them with the truths of the gospel as summarized by the five solas of the Reformation.<br /><br />The pagan influences he identifies are:<br /><br />-All is One and One is All.  This contrasts with One God, One Creator (Soli Deo Gloria)<br /><br />-Humanity is One.  This contrasts with One in Christ Alone (Sola Christus)<br /><br />-All Reglions Are One.  This contrasts with One Truth (sola scriptura)<br /><br />-One Problem: Anmesia.  This contrasts with One Problem: Death Through Sin (Sola Gratia)<br /><br />-One Escape: Look Within.  This contrasts with One Escape: Look to Him (Sola Fides)<br /><br />The author does a capable job of pointing out the main pagan influences on our society and does an interesting job of contrasting them with the truths of the Bible.  While I found his comparisons a bit \\"forced\\" it does make a fascinating contrast between Christianity and other religions.  My only real concern with the book is that I do not quite know who it would appeal to.  I suspect most Christians would be familiar with the bulk of the material and the points are not well enough defended to convince unbelievers.  Despite this, it is an interesting book and receives my recommendation.	2004-10-24

The most popular of these is the New International Version, but other popular translations such as the Contemporary English Version, The Message and the New Living Translation have also been guided by these principles.  One does not have to look far to find a book that is critical of the translation techniques and principles that have come to be known as dynamic equivalency.  The bulk of the books written to defend literal translations are written by theologians, many of whom are convinced that the King James version is the only pure English translation.  That is where The Word of God in English stands apart, for it is written not by a theologian but by a Professor of English, Leland Ryken, who is a literary critic and a professor at Wheaton College.  Having devoted his life to studying and teaching the English language, he is able to approach the subject with a fresh perspective.<br /><br />The book begins with a variety of definitions that will be relevant to the discussion that will follow and then turns to a short history of English Bible translations.  We are taught some lessons from the history of translation and even from ordinary, everyday discourse.  The author then discusses some fallacies about the Bible, about translation and about Bible readers.  For example, he shows that the Bible is not always a simple book - one that is easy to understand - which puts it at odds with dynamic equivalent translators who would seek to make it so.  He speaks about the fallacy of translating meaning rather than words and shows how it is not the translator's job to discern the meaning but to accurately translate his words so that the reader can be left with an accurate representation of the Author's words.<br /><br />Following discussion of each of these fallacies, Ryken moves to theological and hermeneutical discussions and then to various problems inherent in modern translations and proposes some possible solutions.  Perhaps the most interesting section here is the one that deals with destabilization of the text where he shows that as texts are interpreted and dynamically translated, they become destabilized so the true meaning is no longer transparent to a person reading the translated version.<br /><br />The book closes with a length discussion of the literary merits of the Bible in its original languages and the necessity of ensuring these merits extend to translations.  He speaks about diction, poetry, rhythm and even the actual words that are used.<br /><br />The author's conclusion is obvious: modern dynamic equivalent translations of the Scriptures are deeply and irrevocably flawed.  Only with a literal translation and one that gives heed to more than simply words but also the literary qualities of translation, can we have the Bible as God intends for us to have it in a translated form.  While Ryken does not recommend one translation above others, he served as literary stylist for the English Standard Version and clearly considers that his translation of choice, and with good reason, it would seem.<br /><br />I found this book fascinating as it spoke to my loves both of the English language and of the Bible.  Ryken makes a very strong argument and one that could not easily be refuted.  While I have always leaned towards literal translations for my times of study, I now know why I must continue to do so.  The author makes a complex topic readable and enjoyable and ultimately leaves the reader with very compelling evidence.  I highly recommend this book.fallacies, Ryken moves to theological and hermeneutical discussions and then to various problems inherent in modern translations and proposes some possible solutions.

They represent such a selfless expression of Christ's love - people who dedicate their lives to sharing the gospel with those who least want to hear it, but most need to hear it.  Not only do they forsake the comforts of Western society and leave behind friends, jobs, church and family, but they often put their lives in danger by ministering in unstable nations.<br /><br />In The Presence of My Enemies tells the story of Martin and Gracia Burnham, a missionary couple who were kidnapped and held for over a year by the Abu Sayyaf, a terrorist group with ties to Osama Bin Laden.  While celebrating their anniversary at a small resort in the Philippines they were snatched away and spent the next year of their lives on the run, fighting to survive in the Philippine jungles.  They were constantly faced with incredible hardship and often lacked even the most rudimentary comforts.  They were held pending the payment of a large ransom, one which missionary groups will never pay.  It was not until the aftermath of September 11 that real progress was made in trying to rescue the Burnhams.<br /><br />The author provides interesting insight into this small but radical and powerful terrorist group.  We see the interaction of the various members of the group and the methods they employ to draft soldiers to their cause and to take more hostages.  We see the Islamic faith through the eyes of some of its most radical followers as they seek to live and, if possible, die for Allah.  Contrasted to this is the simple faith of two Christians, who share love when all around them are filled with hate.  We continually see Christ's love shining out in the midst of pain, loneliness and terror.  Gracia is honest in portraying a faith that sometimes wavered, yet stood the test because it was built on a sure foundation.<br /><br />In the end we have to conclude with the author that God is gracious, and above all, sovereign.  Nothing that happened surprised Him, and the Burnhams were never outside of His sight.  Whenever they felt lowest, He provided something to buoy their spirits.  When they were in good spirits, He used the opportunity to teach them about Himself.<br /><br />The book is very well-written and moves along briskly.  At times I wished Gracia had gone into more detail about her spiritual state as well as her husband's while they were faced with trials, but she does mention that her memory of many events is hazy, so I presume that is the reason she does not delve deeper into that area.<br /><br />A powerful book and one that is sure to provide encouragement, and I am happy to recommend In The Presence of My Enemies.happened surprised Him, and the Burnhams were never outside of His sight.

Books	1	42	59	N	N	An Absolute Mess	There are many reviews here which summarize much of what I discovered about this book, so I will summarize some of my greatest concerns.<br />Thesis<br />Page 25 seems to summarize the thesis of the book. It says &quot;We discover that meaning and purpose only when we make God the reference point of our lives.&quot; This seems to say that if the reader finds God he will also find himself and his purpose. This is not the gospel!<br />Multiple translations<br />Rick Warren quotes the Bible over 1,200 times in the text of The Purpose Driven Life. To do so, he uses fifteen different translations and paraphrases. Appendix 3 contains his rationale for this and he provides two reasons for the number of translations. The first is that in any single translation &quot;nuances and shades of meaning can be missed, so it is always helpful to compare translations.&quot; The second is &quot;the fact that we often miss the full impact of familiar Bible verses, not because of poor translating, but simply because they have become so familiar.&quot; He believes this will &quot;help you see God's truth in new, fresh ways.&quot;<br />The author's logic is faulty as the two reasons he provides contradict each other. If a translation introduces something in a new and fresh way it will necessarily introduce new nuances and shades of meaning. The way to remove nuances and shades of meaning is to use as literal a translation as possible so that the words are God's alone and are not interpreted by the translator. The author can then exposit the text, clarifying what might require clarification. This is nothing more than the traditional means of teaching what the Bible says.<br />Audience<br />The author aims this book at two distinct audiences - believers and unbelievers. He shows that he is, initially at least, writing for unbelievers by inviting them to pray a short prayer, asking them to say &quot;Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you.&quot; He then welcomes them to the family of God.I fear, though, that he uses too many Christian terms and phrases to really connect with unbelievers. Similarly, if he is hoping to reach new Christians, I think the same holds true - the &quot;Christianese&quot; terms and many of the Biblical references may alienate them. On the other hand, if he is hoping to reach mature Christians, much of the book will be too simplistic for them.<br />We know from the Bible that there is a vast difference between believers and unbelievers. Those who have come to a saving knowledge of Christ have had their very natures changed. They have become adopted children of God and have become heirs to His promises. They have special privileges and they have knowledge and faith that unbelievers do not. This is not to say that a book can or should not be written that attempts to reach both audiences. What it does mean is that an author must be sure to distinguish between audiences, being careful not to mislead either audience.<br />Warren often fails to differentiate between audiences. For example, in the second chapter he quotes Ephesians 1:4 which reads &quot;just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.&quot; The context of this verse shows that the author is referring to only Christians, yet Warren makes no distinction.<br />The Gospel<br />The author does not at any time provide a clear explanation of the gospel message. On page 58 he says, &quot;Real life begins by committing yourself completely to Jesus Christ&quot; but never comes closer than that. He never writes about such crucial doctrines as man's sinfulness and need for a Savior or the work of Jesus. He never mentions the importance Christ's life, the cross or the empty tomb. Yet on page 58 we find him leading the prayer of &quot;Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you&quot; and then saying &quot;Welcome to the family of God!&quot; How can a person become a Christian without any understanding of his own sinfulness or of Christ's sacrifice on our behalf?<br />Warren's gospel seems to be one of purpose. He teaches that man's greatest problem is purposelessness and this book will remedy that situation by helping the reader discover his purpose. Needless to say, this is not the gospel as taught by the Bible. The Bible teaches that man's greatest problem is that he is a sinner and is alienated from God. Purposelessness is insignificant compared to the possibility of an eternity in hell.<br />Life Application<br />The aim studying the Bible is application. We are to study the Bible so we can apply what we learn to our lives, with the ultimate aim of conforming ourselves to the image of Christ. Application, though, depends on proper teaching and sound knowledge. It stands to reason that a person cannot apply to his life something he does not understand. Teaching stands as the foundation that application is built upon.<BR>Since Warren does not explain the gospel and the real means of salvation, how can people truly apply what he teaches? If everything is application, what do they really believe in?<br />Bible Use<br />We have already seen how the author has used multiple translations as well as his justification for doing so. Of even greater concern is his carelessness in his use of the Bible. He continually removes Scripture passages from their proper context in order to make them suit his purposes. He carelessly applies promises to the reader that clearly do not apply. He also distorts or changes the meanings of certain passages to make them say what he wants them to say. This is well-documented in other reviews on this site.<br />I can recommend this book only to discerning readers. There is certainly some value in the book, but in my opinion the bad outweighs the good. I would certainly not use this as an introduction to Christianity or as a means of reaching unbelievers.	2004-10-11

US	43519458	R3VLEU484MSNXS	0842313354	136742732	Chosen by God	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Solid Introduction	Since its publication in 1986, &lt;em>Chosen By God&lt;/em> has become a classic introduction to Calvinism, for it is clearly one of the best introductions to Calvinism available.  Sproul, ever the theologian but one with a gift for making the complex simple, begins with an introduction to God's sovereignty and then moves to free will before tackling the 5-points of Calvinism (as summarized in the acronym TULIP).  He changes several of the terms, so the acronym eventually reads RULEP, but provides good justification for doing so.  Not being one to back down from a fight, Sproul also tackles the subject of double predestination and assurance of salvation.  The book closes with a Questions and Objections section which answers some of the most common objections to Calvinism, such as \\"Is predestination fatalism?\\" and \\"What does predestination do for the task of evangelism?\\"<br /><br />It is important to note that this book is only an introduction to Calvinism, so does not provide exhaustive commentary on any single topic, each of which could easily become a book of its own.  While 200 pages is plenty to introduce topics, it certainly does not allow for in-depth discussion.<br /><br />The chapters on God's Sovereignty and Free Will were particularly well-written and alone are worth the price of the book.  A book that discusses difficult concepts but does so in a biblical manner, and ultimately provides very satisfying conclusions, I give this one my unreserved recommendation.	2004-10-05
US	43519458	R2A3UP1TH052N6	158229285X	906309131	The God of Yes: Living the Life You Were Promised	Books	2	8	13	N	N	This Book Is A Mess	I'm going to be straight with you: I did not finish this book. Generally I will not review a book until I have read it from cover-to-cover, but in this case I just couldn't do it. I got about two thirds of the way through and had to call it quits. It wasn't that the book was so heretical I just couldn't take it anymore (though there were a few theological problems) and it wasn't that it was poorly written. The foremost problem with this book, and the one that finally caused me just to put it down, is the author's (David Edwards) sense of humor.<br /><br />The author has a very immature, sarcastic sense of humor and he seems to feel the need to put it on display on every page. You can open the book to almost any page and find some dumb comment that is supposed to be funny. I'll give a few examples:<br /><br />  ...the object of playing the game, of course, is winning (unless you're the Dallas Cowboys).<br /><br />  What is born is something you're still trying to make sense of (like those recurring monthly VISA charges and the Ab Doer in your closet that really doesn't).<br /><br />  You may be saying to yourself (if you are, please don't move your mouth - that really looks crazy).<br /><br />  Now for the flip side (Sorry for the reference to records - you know, those black vinyl disks that were once used to play back music?)<br /><br />  I dated a girl with so many personalities, she formed her own softball team. When I finally talked her into going to therapy, the doctor charged her group rates.<br /><br />You get the idea. Incidentally, those last three were all taken from the same page! The entire book (or at least the first two thirds since that is all I could bear reading) is like that. He makes a point and then tries to make us laugh. It's obnoxious and just wore me right out. And as you can see, the standard construct is: make a point, open bracket, add obnoxious statement, close bracket, continue.<br /><br />Beyond the humor, there is still a book. The author, who labels himself an \\"itinerant, postmodern pastor\\" tries to convince the reader that he will help him discover a God of infinte hope, of unlimited possibilities, of eternal yes. Whatever that means. I think his thesis is that our perception of our world influences our perception of God, and then out perception of God influences the way we experience God. We must, then, have a right view of God in order to be able to experience Him properly. He then frames knowing God in the context of some of the covenants He made with various people or groups in the Bible.<br /><br />The author seems to have been influenced by John Eldredge. \\"[God] willingly made Himself a prisoner of His own affections for us. His affections compel Him to do everything possible to pursue us and win us back to His heart.\\" That sounds like a direct quote from The Sacred Romance! Edwards also tells us that God doesn't control every detail of the world - He doesn't micromanage but \\"leads people with the power of choice.\\" We also find out that \\"If God's plans are indelibly printer and incapable of being changed, we potentially could make one too many wrong choices and get to the point where it's impossible for God to bring us back in like with His purpose. Here's the truth: God's purpose never changes, but His plans to accomplish His purpose are completely flexible.\\" He then tells us that when God sent Moses to tell Pharaoh to \\"Let My people go,\\" He really was waiting for Pharaoh's response. \\"There were ten plagues because of Pharaoh's hard heart, not because God was following a script that would one day make a good movie.\\" Where I come from we call this open theism - God knew the possibilities, He just didn't know which Pharaoh would choose. Of course the Bible tells us that God Himself hardened Pharaoh's heart several times, which would seem to indicate He had a pretty good idea that Pharaoh would reject God's command.<br /><br />Now the book isn't all bad. There is, for example, some good teaching about God confronting the sin in our lives. There is also value in learning that we are to live in agreement with God, not trying to conform God to what we want Him to be. The problem is, there is as much bad teaching as good.<br /><br />The fact is, this book is a mess. It's poorly written and contains some pretty awful theology. If the editor had just gone through and removed most of those sarcastic attempts at humor, the book would at least have been readable. But it just isn't. If you are really looking for a book to guide you into a more accurate view of God, pick up something by John MacArthur or R.C. Sproul. At least they understand God and have a solid grasp of theology. Needless to say, I don't recommend The God of Yes.s, for example, some good teaching about God confronting the sin in our lives. There is also value in learning that we are to live in agreement with God, not trying to conform God to what we want Him to be. The problem is, there is as much bad teaching as good. <br /> <br />The fact is, this book is a mess. It's poorly written and contains some pretty awful theology.

It will certainly not be my last.  On the cover of the book J.I. Packer declares the book \\"a breaktaking workout\\" and his praise is justified.  This book points us back to the Reformation and ultimately to the Bible itself as the source of an amazing grace that much of modern Christianity seems to have lost.  He presents timeless truths as being as relevant to us today as they were when they were first discovered.<br /><br />Horton redraws the standard TULIP acronym using modern terms.  Total Depravity becomes Rebels Without A Cause, Unconditional Election becomes Grace Before Time, Limited Atonement becomes Mission Accomplished, Irresistible Grace becomes Intoxicating Grace and Perseverance of The Saints becomes No Lost Causes.  While the terms may have changed, the truth behind each is defended and, perhaps best of all, made relevant to life.  More than a theological treatise, this book contains an element of intense practicality where Horton shows how these doctrines are relevant to everyday life.<br /><br />Among the other topics Horton covers are dispensationalism which he bravely attacks and the sacraments which he describes as being two keys to spiritual growth.  I found the chapter of sacraments the weakest part of the book.  While he has given me some food for thought, I do have to take issue with some of his statements.  He takes a firm stance for paedo-baptism as well as a sacramental view of the \\"ordinances\\", so be prepared for that.  His comments about evangelical churches adding extra sacraments (ie recommitment) are well-taken.<br /><br />Perhaps my greatest praise is that this book challenges so many assumptions and so many of the words and phrases Christians use all the time.  Horton traces the evolution of many of these phrases and shows how they are unbiblical at best, and heretical at worst.  Some examples of this are \\"let go and let God\\" and \\"the Spirit's leading.\\"  Common phrases, but ones we use without really examining their underlying theological implications.<br /><br />I do not use the term life-changing easily, but I do not believe it would be unfair to say that this book can change a life.  It is a stunning portrayal of the doctrines of grace and one I know I will return to often.  I give it my wholehearted recommendation for all believers.  If you do not know the doctrines of grace, read this book and discover them for yourself.  If you do, read this book to rediscover their greatness.  This book will leave you in awe before the greatness of our God.ding.\\"  Common phrases, but ones we use without really examining their underlying theological implications. <br /> <br />I do not use the term life-changing easily, but I do not believe it would be unfair to say that this book can change a life.

Wild at Heart has been studied in men's groups across the world, giving Eldredge a wide reach and his teachings great acceptance. In Epic he changes his emphasis from a Christian audience to an unbelieving audience, as this book is clearly primarily targeted at those who are not Christians.<br />Conservative Christians have long been suspicious of Eldredge's writing, and with good cause, for he does not appear to understand human depravity. In previous books he has taught that the human heart, after it is regenerated by God, becomes intrinsically good. He says that the words of Jeremiah which teach us that &quot;the heart is deceitful and desperately wicked&quot; no longer apply to Christians. With such a vast misunderstanding of the human condition, it is no wonder that his teachings often stray. Many of his teachings are also nearly indistinguishable from those who teach Open Theism, though he denies that he holds to this theology. I give this information as background since it is relevant to our examination of his newest book, Epic: The Story God Is Telling And The Role That Is Yours To Play.<br />Epic tells us that life is a story which unfolds like a grand drama. It seems that humans have an obsession with stories. From the time we are tiny children we love to hear stories about heroes and villains, good guys and bad. The reason we love story so much, Eldredge writes, is that there is something in the human heart that tells us there is an epic going around us, where God is the central character, but where we also play an important role. We love stories about the conquering hero who arrives at the last possible moment to save his lover, because that is exactly what Jesus has done for us.<br />The book, then, revolves around stories. The author supports his claims with example after example from popular movies. A few of the movies he references are Apollo 13, Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, Saving Private Ryan, Pinocchio, Finding Nemo, Titanic, Braveheart, Gladiator (no surprise if you have read Wild at Heart and Star Wars. He relies heavily on quotes from other writers such as G.K. Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, Phillip Yancey, Gerald May, Soren Kierkegaard, George MacDonald and William Shakespeare. The book also contains plenty of Bible verses, most taken from solid translations.<br />And herein lies the greatest problem with the book. Because Eldredge misunderstands the human condition, he believes that some sort of goodness inherent in the human heart causes us to seek after stories the way we should seek after God. The stories we all know and love are an expression of the human heart that tells us that we are all really part of a great, cosmic epic. While we may not consciously realize this, the heart somehow does. When Jack Dawson sacrifices his life for Rose in the movie Titanic, that is an expression of the human heart's desire to be saved by Jesus.<br />Despite that problem, I will reluctantly admit that this book was not as bad as I was expecting it to be. I realize I should begin reading each book with an open mind, but having disliked his previous books so much I just couldn't do it. While there is some poor theology in Epic, there is not nearly as much as in Eldredge's previous books (though perhaps that has to do with the fact that this book is a mere 104 pages long). There are, however, a few problems. For example, he uses the standard argument that God gave humans absolute free will since only with free will could we truly love Him. He provides no Scriptural support for this, relying instead on a lengthy quote from Phillip Yancey. Also, many of the unbiblical teachings of his previous books find their way into this one, as we continually come across the language he uses in The Sacred Romance and Wildat Heart.<br />Epic, then, seems to be an effort from John Eldredge to take his message to unbelievers. It is geared as a tool for evangelism. I see little reason to believe that it will succeed in that, for there is no clear presentation of the gospel. Furthermore, he cheapens the gospel story by equating it with the message of movies such as Titanic and The Matrix. At the same time, the book is well-written and can easily be read and digested in a mere couple of hours, so I have little doubt that many will read and enjoy it. I do not recommend this book or any other of Eldredge's writings.at Heart.<br />Epic, then, seems to be an effort from John Eldredge to take his message to unbelievers.

The first were written before his death (including his own autobiography) and hundreds have been written since.  In the two years following his death, new biographies were published at the rate of one per month! One would be justified in asking, then, why we need another one.  Arnold Dallimore answers this question in the preface, saying that in his studies he discovered no definitive volume.  He found, for example, that no other biography gave a satisfactory account of Spurgeon's ability as a theologian or the methods he used in leading souls to Christ.  Also, his character was often made to appear weaker than it really was.  And so Dallimore sought to remedy these faults in his volume which was first published in 1984.<br /><br />I quote again from the preface: \\"I trust that, at least to some extent, this book provides a more satisfactory account of the great Spurgeon...I have endeavored to understand and present something of the inner man - Spurgeon in his praying, his sufferings and depressions, his weaknesses and strengths, in his triumphs, his humor, his joys, and his incredible accomplishments.\\"<br /><br />Dallimore succeeds admirably.  He presents Spurgeon as more than a great and powerful preacher.  He presents him as a man who was the product of a long line of believers, a man whose life was filled with struggles and a man who emerged victorious.  Above all, we see a man who was specially gifted by God and used those gifts to the fullest.  Spurgeon's legacy is nearly immeasurable in souls won, in faith strengthened and in his influence over other preachers.  He truly earned his title as the Prince of Preachers.<br /><br />While not a definitive treatment of Spurgeon's life (it weighs in at a mere 244 pages while other biographies have been many times that length), this book is a wonderful starting place to learn to appreciate one of God's most humble servants.  As with any good Christian biography, this book will serve to strengthen your faith and will turn your thoughts not to the man, but to the God to whom the man dedicated his life.  I give it my wholehearted recommendation.e servants.

This is a question that has perplexed Christians since the days of the early church.  While most Christians have held the view that their children are in heaven, the majority have believed that without being able to adequately defend their position.  In this book MacArthur provides a Biblical examination of the issues and ultimately provides a satisfying answer.<br /><br />In this short review I will not examine the issue itself, but MacArthur's handling of the issue.<br /><br />MacArthur's position is that all children who die, regardless of the era they were born in, their nationality or the religion of their parents, are immediately ushered into heaven.  When Larry King interviewed him in the aftermath of September 11, he asked MacArthur what happened to any children who lost their lives in the tragedies.  His answer was (and remains) \\"instant heaven.\\"  While that answer was all King wanted, inquiring minds are intrigued by the Biblical grounds for such a view.  The author spends several chapters carefully crafting his argument.  He gives examples from the Bible which show that there is some assurance that children can be taken to heaven (David's son is the common example) and provides a mountain of other important evidence.  Most of this, while it helps build the case, does not prove anything on its own.<br /><br />Essentially, though, the argument comes down to this: salvation is by grace, damnation by works - most notably the action of rejecting God.  Infants are incapable of rejecting or accepting God, and thus God chooses to extend His mercy to them.  It is important to note that God saves them not on the basis of justice but on the basis of His grace.<br /><br />After making the argument, MacArthur spends several chapters speaking about whether parents will see and know their children in heaven, why the child had to die and what others can do to help grieving parents.  The book is interspersed with the stories and testimonies of parents who have suffered a loss and have taken comfort in God's promises.<br /><br />MacArthur makes a compelling, Biblical argument to support the idea that all children who die in infancy are saved by the great mercy of God and are safe for eternity in the arms of a loving God.  I give it my recommendation.ur spends several chapters speaking about whether parents will see and know their children in heaven, why the child had to die and what others can do to help grieving parents.

(LifeChange Books)	Books	4	66	72	N	N	A Great Introduction	It takes a brave man to write another book geared towards convincing unbelievers that being good simply isn't enough to earn God's favor.  There are so many similar books available and most unbelievers have heard the arguments so many times that they simply fall on deaf ears.  Andy Stanley, though, wrote How Good Is Good Enough? to cover this topic one more time and he covers it admirably.<br /><br />The book is based around the premise that every religion other than Christianity is based on the premise that good deeds can earn us a favorable place in the afterlife.  This, the world's most popular theory about heaven, falls flat when examined in depth, and Stanley examines it thoroughly.  He asks the usual questions (\\"if you were to stand before God and He were to ask why He should let you get into heaven, what would you say?\\") and uses the familiar arguments (\\"Jesus was either a liar, a lunatic or exactly who He said He was\\") yet somehow avoids making the book fell like it is filled with nothing but clich&eacute;.  Perhaps the fact that it is written conversationally, almost as if Stanley was sitting in a room with you and just sharing his faith, makes it feel different.  It is filled with examples from his own life and ministry, giving it a sense of genuineness.<br /><br />The book is divided into two sections.  The first speaks about common understandings of God, the afterlife and how we can secure a place in heaven.  The second section presents the Christian alternative to the arguments of other religions.  Stanley shows, for example, how a common objection to the reality of heaven and hell is that sending people to hell is not fair.  To counter this, he presents God as merciful rather than fair, for fairness would condemn us all to hell.<br /><br />The book concludes with a prayer and the author is careful to point out that faith, not a prayer, is what saves.  The prayer covers sin, the fact that we deserve punishment and the reality of Jesus' substitution.<br /><br />Theologically the book was solid, and examining it from my Calvinist viewpoint I found no significant shortcomings.  Especially noteworthy was that the author used a solid Bible translation throughout and did not \\"dumb down\\" the message of the gospel and neither did he rob it of its power by giving only half the story.  This is the good ol' fashioned gospel presented honestly and powerfully.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this book and recommend it as a gift for a friend or family member who does not believe.  It is easy to read, short (a mere 92 pages) and covers the topic as well as any similar book I've read.d, and examining it from my Calvinist viewpoint I found no significant shortcomings.

I set out to write a full review of this book but after a while just had to give up.  The book was so full of error and absolutely ridiculous nonsense that I just didn't have the heart to document it all. Honestly, I was frustrated and discouraged to see that a book like Wild at Heart could make it to the top of the Christian best-seller's lists.<br /><br />Some of the greatest concerns are:<br /><br />  * Open Theism - Though Eldredge denies he is an open theist, the evidence does not support his claim. Time and time again he speaks of God in ways that can only be explained if you hold such views. \\"God is a person who takes immense risks\\" (p. 30). \\"It's not the nature of God to limit His risks and cover His bases\\" (p.31). \\"As with every relationship, there's a certain amount of unpredictability.... God's willingness to risk is just astounding.... There is definitely something wild in the heart of God\\" (p. 32).<br /><br />  * View of Satan - Eldredge views Satan as the one who is to blame when we sin. He seems to believe that we are little more than victims rather than being fully, 100% responsible for our own sins.<br /><br />  * View of Jesus - According to Eldredge Jesus failed at something he attempted. When He encounters the guy who lives out in the Gerasenes tombs, tormented by a legion of spirits, the first rebuke by Jesus doesn't work. He had to get more information to really take them on\\" (Luke 8:26-33) (p. 166). This, of course, is a complete misrepresentation of what happens in that passage.<br /><br />  * Use of Scripture - Eldredge does what is becoming all too common in the evangelical world these days. He uses verses and passages from the Bible without giving any context simply to make it sound like this is a Biblically-based book. Time and time and time again he assigns meanings to passages that are completely foreign to their true sense. At one point Garry Gilley says about the particularly ridiculous interpretation of the book of Ruth, \\"after all, no one else, to my knowledge, in the history of conservative biblical exegesis has ever come up with it before.\\" Eldredge seems to make up meanings as he goes along.<br /><br />  * Revelation - Eldredge says that God talks to him directly. He also speaks to him through movies, books and so on.<br /><br />I could go on, but really, what's the point? This book only resembles a Christian book in the most vague sense. Yes, Eldredge attempts to hold everything together with some smatterings of Scripture, but when you evaluate this book honestly you have to see that this is mere humanism and psychology wrapped in a thin veil of Christianity. It speaks volumes about the Protestant world that this book has been so widely embraced.<br /><br />I highly recommend the reviews written by Garry Gilley (find him using your favorite search engine).

One of Satan's greatest triumphs is in convincing Christians to abandon the Bible, or at least keeping them from really mining its depths. He tries to convince us that the Bible is outdated, unimportant or less important than many other things. He tries to convince us that it is difficult to understand and that we should rely on others to interpret it for us.<br /><br />R.C. Sproul wrote Knowing Scripture early in his career to address these concerns and out of a desire to see Christians dedicate themselves to a systematic study of the Bible. Written in 1977, this is one of Sproul's earliest but most important and highly recommended books.<br /><br />Sproul begins with an introduction to why we should read the Bible. He dispels myths regarding Scripture being too difficult to understand or too boring to hold our attention. From that foundation he shows how the principle of private interpretation was a pillar of the Reformation and thus remains a pillar of Protestantism. He explains what private interpretation is and what it is not. He shows, for example, that it does not preclude us from verifying our interpretations against those of others. He also stresses the need for objectivity as we read the Scripture. In short, he keeps us from viewing private interpretation as being a method of forcing Scripture to say what we want it to say.<br /><br />He dedicates a chapter to an introduction to hermeneutics. Do not be scared by this technical word as it simply means \\"a list of rules and guidelines for interpreting Scripture.\\" Some of the concepts he introduces are:<br /><br />  * The analogy of faith. This says that Scripture interprets Scripture, or that one passage supports and explains another. It also means that one part of Scripture never corrects another part, for Scripture needs to correction.<br /><br />  * Literal Interpretation. This says that Scripture needs to be scrutinized as literature, paying attention to grammar, word choice and genre. Just because the Bible is a special book does not mean we can ignore standard literal interpretation.<br /><br />  * Genre Analysis. This says that Scripture must be analyzed for genre and it is crucial that we distinguish between genres such as history and poetry.<br /><br />  * Grammatico-Historical. This is a method of interpreting Scripture that focuses on, among other things, grammatical constructions and historical context. This is the traditional and most accurate method of hermeneutics.<br /><br />  * Authorship and Dating. It is important to understand the dating of a particular book or passage as well as its authorship.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is contained in a chapter that lays out ten rules for Biblical interpretation. They are:<br /><br />  1. Do not change the rules of interpretation for the Bible. Read the Bible just like any other book<br /><br />  2. Seek to empathize with the Biblical characters<br /><br />  3. Narratives must be interpreted by the didactic<br /><br />  4. The implicit is to be interpreted by the explicit<br /><br />  5. Determine the meaning of words using lexicography, etymology and context<br /><br />  6. Note the presence of parallelisms<br /><br />  7. Note the difference between proverb and law<br /><br />  8. Observe the difference between the spirit and the letter of the law<br /><br />  9. Be careful with parables<br /><br />  10. Be careful with predictive prophecy<br /><br />Each of these points receives careful attention. Though some of them may sound shocking (such as \\"read the Bible just like any other book\\") Sproul provides solid reasons for the necessity of each.<br /><br />The author then turns his attention to a discussion of culture and the Bible. Just I am confined to a specific cultural setting, so were the authors of the Bible. We need to be able to discern the difference between principle and custom in regards to the Bible. Sproul provides several guidelines for doing this.<br /><br />The book closes with a discussion of some resources that may help in studying the Bible. These range from commentaries to dictionaries and lexicons. If there is an area of this book that shows its age, it is in this section. There are so many more resources at our disposal now, especially on the Internet, that this section loses some of its usefulness. A discussion of modern translations and some of the newer commentaries would be helpful. Perhaps a second edition of this book is in order. One thing I found amusing is that the author says he does not agree with study Bibles, yet years later was the editor of the New Geneva Study Bible (later renamed the Reformation Study Bible). I presume his view changed!<br /><br />This book does a wonderful job of introducing hermeneutics for the lay person and I would recommend it for any Christian. It presents advanced concepts in a way that it easy to read and understand. My only complaint is that it advances many rules but does not dedicate any attention to the \\"how's\\" of hermeneutics.

Sproul's sequel to the popular book \\"Faith Alone: The Evangelical Doctrine of Justification\\" and is a thorough treatment of the subject of Christian unity. It is essentially a response to a document that tested the boundaries of unity between Roman Catholics and Evangelical Protestants: \\"The Gift of Salvation\\" (also known as ECT II) which was released subsequently to the original \\"Evangelicals and Catholics Together.\\" These documents were both written and signed by leading members of Evangelical and Catholic churches as a means to promote unity between the churches. They chose to find common ground and unite on that basis rather than focus on the differences that separated them. Sproul and several other prominent Reformed Christians stood against this document, insisting that it did not form an adequate basis for unity with the Roman Catholic Church.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections. The first is entitled Controversy Concerning The Gospel and provides background to the importance of Christian unity in traditional Evangelicalism. The section functions almost as an introductory course to Christian doctrine regarding unity. Among other topics it discusses the distinction between the visible and invisible church, the marks of a true church and Christ's desire for unity.<br /><br />In the second section Sproul provides the complete text to \\"The Gift of Salvation\\" and then provides a thorough examination of each paragraph. His amazing depth of knowledge allows him to delve deeply into the document and point out many problems with it. He shows where the language is ambiguous and goes into lengthy explanation about the differences between the Catholic and Protestant views on soteriology. His conclusion is that the two systems of theology are so far removed that they cannot be brought into harmony. \\"The Gift of Salvation\\" does nothing to remove the doctrinal chasm created by the simple word \\"alone.\\" Until Rome concedes on the \\"solas\\" of the Reformation, there can be no unity. Further, unity on such terms as outlined in this document is damaging to the Evangelical churches as it undermines critical theology. There can be no unity without unity in the gospel, which means there certainly cannot be unity at the expense of the gospel. The unity expressed by the signatories of \\"The Gift of Salvation\\" is empty since it denies the importance of obvious and insurmountable differences in doctrine.<br /><br />The final section is an examination of a document drafted by Sproul and other leading theologians entitled \\"The Gospel of Jesus Christ.\\" They feel this document should provide the basis for unity among Evangelicals. \\"The Gospel of Jesus Christ\\" carefully and consistently lays out the foundations of Protestant theology, leaving absolutely no room for ambiguity. As with the previous document, Sproul examines it paragraph by paragraph, explaining the meaning and importance of each of the affirmations and denials. Sproul says that \\"[the affirmations and denials they list] are the foundation that expresses the mission of the church. For the church to be faithful to the Great Commission, we must get the gospel right. When we do, we will both energize the church's activity and encourage deep and abiding unity among Evangelicals.\\"<br /><br />This book is as good a treatment of the subject of unity as I have read. While deeply theological, it is also very readable. Sproul has a gift for presenting deep truths in a way that is easy to understand. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning what the Bible says about unity, and further to people interested in an overview of the doctrinal differences between Protestants and Catholics.on the \\"solas\\" of the Reformation, there can be no unity.

Much as he did years ago in \\"Ashamed of the Gospel\\", MacArthur takes aim at easy-believism and a watered-down, seeker-friendly gospel. In particular, he criticizes the influence of those who preach self-esteem, a health and wealth gospel and aim to be overly seeker-friendly. This book forceful - so much so that there were several places where the force of his words and his anger at the perversion of the gospel shocked me and stopped me short. MacArthur's righteous indignation reminded me of Spurgeon who wrote many similar books and essays in his day. In case you are wondering more specifically who he is writing about, the only person he mentions by name is Robert Schuller and his infamously antibiblical book \\"Self Esteem: The New Reformation.\\" However, it is easy to see shades of many popular Bible teachers if one reads between the lines.<br /><br />While I have utmost respect for MacArthur and regard him as one of my most trusted Bible teachers, I often find that he speaks out against a caricature of a movement rather than a more accurate portrayal. He tends to speak in generalities and criticize a worst-case scenario. I suppose this is necessary lest he speak out against a specific person or church, yet it does cause his words to lose some of their impact. I have been heavily exposed to the seeker-friendly movement and have found that much of it is not as badly corrupted as he would indicate. Despite that small complaint, this book is powerful and contains a clear depiction of the gospel. And even more important, it contains a clear call to maintain the purity of the gospel and to ensure that the church continues to focus on preaching the pure gospel. To allow unbelievers to influence our churches to such an extent that we replace the gospel with something friendlier to the unregenerate is to deviate from God's plan and further, is to lead the church into inevitable decay. The gospel is not meant to be kind to unbelievers; it is meant to either convict or offend. As with all MacArthur's books, he quotes liberally from Scripture and exposits God's word to the reader. Few men are more gifted in that task than he is.<br /><br />I did find one particularly troubling statement in the book. One page 93 MacArthur writes, \\"Salvation isn't the result of an intellectual exercise. It comes from a life lived in obedience and service to Christ as revealed in the Scripture; it's the fruit of actions, not intentions. There's no room for passive spectators: words without actions are empty and futile... The life we live, not the words we speak, determines our eternal destiny.\\" While I agree that faith and actions can not be separated, to say \\"salvation...comes from a life lived in obedience and service to Christ\\" is dangerous ground. I know enough about MacArthur to understand he is not preaching salvation by works, but one could easily understand his words to mean that. In his eagerness to criticize the seeker-friendly gospel, it seems he almost begins to advocate works-righteousness.<br /><br />\\"Hard to Believe\\" presents the gospel as it is - as something that is more than hard, but actually impossible to believe without the Spirit's help. Watering it down - making it easy to believe - can never succeed. When we tamper with the gospel we tamper with the very wisdom of God, who saw fit to share news that is so foolish that none can believe it without His illumination. Our job is to preach the gospel, and full gospel, and leave the results to God. \\"Then, instead of being unbelievable and foolish, these words that are so hard to believe become the only balm that soothes a sinful heart...Those hard words become precious and welcome and treasured. `All that the Father gives to Christ, they will come.' They will come. Our calling is to reach them with the truth.\\" (page 215) That very truth is the foundation of this book.<br /><br />I am happy to recommend this book. I believe it would make an interesting companion to \\"Ashamed of the Gospel\\" which covers much of the same material but from an earlier perspective. While \\"Ashamed of the Gospel\\" serves as a warning, \\"Hard to Believe\\" serves as a wake-up call. And truly the church needs to wake up and return to the clear, forceful preaching of the Good News of Jesus Christ!recommend this book.

I have had the privilege of attending that church many times over the years and have always been blessed by Richard's exposition of Scripture.  He truly is a very gifted teacher.  While he is primarily a pastor, he has also written several books, the most recent of which is \\"20 Controversies That Almost Killed A Church.\\"  The book examines Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, touching on twenty major themes.  While Scripture is featured prominently throughout, the book avoids becoming a dry commentary.  It focuses on thematic discussions rather than a thorough verse-by-verse exposition.<br /><br />Ganz does a great job of interpreting the words of Paul in the light of their historical context while at the same time making the book equally relevant to the twenty first century believer.  He shows how the issues faced by our brothers and sisters in Christ nearly two thousand years ago are really no different from the issues we face today.  The tone of this book matches the tone of Corinthians.  While First Corinthians is a pastoral book, written by a man who deeply loved and cared for his flock, so \\"20 Controversies\\" is written in a pastoral tone.  Just as Paul was not afraid to call his church to task, so Ganz emulates the apostle's example, being harsh when necessary, yet maintaining a respectful, loving tone.<br /><br />It takes courage to tackle the issues of Corinthians, yet Ganz does so unapologetically.  He writes forcefully about the gifts of the Spirit, speaking in tongues, headship and situations regarding marriage and divorce.  Each topic is interspersed with examples from Ganz's own years of ministry which lends a helpful authenticity to the book.  More than mere exposition, this book is built on pastoral experience.  Other topics he writes about are baptism with the Holy Spirit, baptism for the dead, lawsuits against the church, divisions in the church, the scandal of the cross and idolatry.<br /><br />There were two little nagging problems that I found with \\"20 Controversies That Almost Killed A Church.\\"  The first was that the book was inconsistently formatted.  Some chapters were presented ordinally (ie topics were listed 1) 2) 3) and so on) while others were presented with subheadings.  A small problem, I admit, yet I find it is easier to read a book when the formatting is consistent.  The second was that the book was not terribly well-written.  While certainly readable, it is a bit clumsy in parts, especially in regards to sentence structure.  However, neither of those problems significantly detracts from the book.<br /><br />I found this book thought-provoking and, as Jay Adams says in his endorsement, \\"thoroughly biblical.\\"  It is filled with practical guidance that allows Paul's words to ring loud and true through two thousand years of history.

We face decisions every day of our lives - some are as minor as what to wear or what to eat, while others may be huge, impacting our lives or the lives of hundreds or even millions of others. As Christians it is crucial that we understand Biblical principles on how to make decisions that will honor and glorify God. It is to this subject that the book Decisions, Decisions is dedicated.<br /><br />The book approaches the subject matter first from the perspective of how not to make decisions. To illustrate how not to make decisions the author, Dave Swavely, uses several phrases and ideas that are in common use in Christian circles and shows how they do not follow Biblical foundations for decision-making. Among the ones he discusses are: \\"I flipped a coin,\\" \\"God gave me a sign,\\" \\"God told me,\\" and \\"God opened all the doors.\\"<br /><br />To begin the discussion he examines revelation and shows how God's revelation to us is sufficient and complete in the Scripture. To seek God's will in certain ways, such as through signs and wonders, is futile, for God no longer operates in such ways. Similarly, to put our faith in random verses of the Bible or flips of a coin are to deny our responsibility to make decisions on our own. After several chapters outlining how not to make decisions, all of them based on things you have heard from Christian friends or may have said yourself, he turns to an examination of the Biblical principles of making godly decisions.<br /><br />He first examines the prerequisites of making Biblical decisions. These are walking in the Spirit, recognizing God's sovereignty and praying for wisdom and providence. Without these prerequisites we cannot expect to be able to make godly decisions. When these prerequisites are in place he outlines four aspects of decision-making. The first key to making Biblical decisions is Scripture. Scripture rules supreme over any of the other principles. The Bible bears on every decision we make, either directly or indirectly. For example, any decision relies on motive, and the Bible has much to say about motives. Also, the other three principles of decision-making are drawn from the Bible. While the Bible does not describe exactly what to do in any given situation, it does tell us everything was absolutely need to know in order to make a proper decision. Scripture points us in the direction of the right decision, even if it does not tell us exactly what we must do.<br /><br />At this point the author teaches that provided an option is not absolutely forbidden by Scripture, we would not sin by taking that option. We are given freedom in Christ to decide whether or not to proceed. So we may now be faced with two decisions: first, should we or should we not do it and second which of the options should we take.<br /><br />The second key to making Biblical decisions is wisdom. He defines wisdom as \\"a knowledge of Scripture and the ability to apply that knowledge in your life.\\" Wisdom is tied to Scripture since Scripture is the source of God's wisdom to us. The words are often used interchangeably in the Bible.<br /><br />The third key is desire. If we are living by the Spirit and immersing ourselves in the Word of God, we see that God will plant desires in our hearts. It is good and proper, then, to do what we desire.<br /><br />The fourth key is counsel. The counsel of other believers who meet the prerequisites of Biblical decision-making should play a part in each of the other aspects. Other believers can share their knowledge of Scripture, can share their godly wisdom and can interpret our desire.<br /><br />These four principles, each backed with ample Scriptural support, provide the author's framework for making Biblical decisions. He presents his case well and his words are convicting. As one who has often struggled in this area, I highly recommend this book.very decision we make, either directly or indirectly.

His book More Ready Than You Realize was recommended to me by several people. One called it \\"the best book I've ever read on evangelism\\" and another went almost as far, calling it \\"one of the best books\\" he had read on the subject. In my discussion of the book I am going to avoid speaking about the emerging church, since evangelism is the true focus of this volume. Though it is difficult to separate the emerging church from McLaren's approach to evangelism, I will seek to do so.<br />The back cover begins with a warning. It says \\"This is not just another book on evangelism. This book contains fresh, encouraging, challenging, groundbreaking and doable ideas you'll want to share with your pastor, your small group or class, your board, or your parachurch organization.\\" The next heading is Out. Under Out it lists: evangelism as sales pitch, as conquest, as warfare, as ultimatum, as threat, as proof, as argument, as entertainment, as show, as monologue, as something you have to do. As what is In the book lists: disciple-making as conversation, as friendship, as influence, as invitation, as companionship, as challenge, as opportunity, as conversation, as dance, as something you get to do. Clearly this book is trying to bring a fresh perspective to a topic many Christians regard as stale.<br />McLaren uses the term \\"spiritual friendship\\" to describe evangelism that will be effective in our postmodern society. Where in the past people have, with varied degrees of success, used many other methods, today we need to rely on friendships and relationships. We need to change our way of thinking so that we no longer regard unbelievers as \\"the lost\\" by instead see them as \\"the precious ones\\" that God is seeking. When we regard them as lost, we necessarily place ourselves in a superior position to them and this impacts our attempts to evangelize them. We also need to stop speaking about \\"winning\\" people for the Lord, as postmoderns hate the old-fashioned terms of conquest and warfare. We need to regard evangelism as a dance where the believer and the unbeliever move in harmony, first one taking the lead and then the other.<br />The book is based on a spiritual friendship the author shared with a young woman he calls Alice. Their relationship was carried on almost entirely via email and went on for some two years (at which point the book was published). McLaren holds this relationship as a model for spiritual friendship. He shows how initially Alice is filled with questions and with disgust for traditional Christianity. By the end of the book she has just as many questions but has respect for God and claims to have developed some sort of faith. Interestingly, the author makes no claim that Alice ever became a believer.<br />McLaren's theology is poor at best. At one point he is faced with the question of \\"why did Jesus have to die?\\" He realizes that all his standard answers to this question would make no impact on a postmodern mind, so he asks for two weeks to come up with an answer. He pulled out his theological volumes by Stott, Packer and Boice and found no answers. Fortunately his brother provided the answer he needed. His brother told him that we do not really know why Jesus died and that even Jesus didn't know, hence His question to God in the Garden of Gethsemane where he asked God if there wasn't some other way He could accomplish His mission! This revelation opened McLaren's eyes and also made a great impact on the person who originally asked him the question. Of course this is terrible theology that shows McLaren (and his brother) are open theists.<br />The book is filled with other strange and theologically erroneous quotes.<br />At the very beginning of the book we find this strange quote: \\"If you are not a committed Christian yourself, I am sure you will understand that sinceChristian commitment is where I'm coming from, it is the approach of this book. This is not to say there isn't a place for Buddhist or Hindu or Jewish evangelism, but someone else will be better suited to write on those topics.\\" (page 15)<br />On page 142 we read \\"This is not to say that questions of heaven and hell are unimportant. It is that they are not as exclusively important as modern Christians have tended to proclaim them to be.\\" I have to wonder what could possibly be more important. Without heaven or hell there is no gospel and no need for a gospel!<br />These are just a few of multitudes of examples. At the back of the book he lists movies that are great (and recommended) for group discussion. One of these is The Big Kahuna.\\" He writes \\"brace yourself for some tough language...\\" (page 187). It would seem that sinning by watching and endorsing such films is an effective evangelistic technique for postmoderns.<br />In the final analysis there are two major issues with McLaren's evangelistic technique. Traditional evangelism has always regarded relationship as the absolute best way to reach unbelievers. McLaren's approach has no sense of urgency. He was content to allow Alice to go two years without ever challenging her with the heart of the gospel. He allowed her to fumble her way through, often leaving her for weeks or months without guidance as she tried to piece it all together herself. So the first issue I take is the lack of urgency. Though I have little doubt that many evangelistic opportunities have been ruined by moving too quickly, I believe you can also move far too slowly. The second issue is that McLaren's technique does not teach the gospel. There is never a mention of sin or repentance, of heaven or hell. Why should people want to be saved if we never share with them what they need to be saved from? His approach is destined to produce many shallow, ignorant \\"Christians\\" who really do not know the gospel.<br />While I approve of the idea of spiritual friendships, I have to conclude that McLaren's approach is faulty. An approach that regards the gospel message as outdated and unnecessary simply cannot please the Lord. I believe we still need to preach the gospel in all its power and force - as much now as at any other point in history. While it may be necessary to abandon some techniques while creating new ones, we can never lose the central focus of the gospel which is sin, death, forgiveness and life!since Christian commitment is where I'm coming from, it is the approach of this book.

He saw in the church of that era a trend away from the preaching of the gospel and towards entertainment.  The church began to focus on pleasing people rather than preaching the gospel in all its offense and power.  The battle Spurgeon waged became known as The Downgrade Controversy.<br />Now, a full century later, John MacArthur is sounding the alarm to warn discerning believers that the crisis the church faced in the late 19th century has come to the modern-day church.  The church is, once again, on the downgrade.  While Spurgeon fought against the influence of liberalism in the church, today we need to fight against the influx of pragmatism.  Believing that those who ignore history are dooming themselves to repeat it, he has written Ashamed of the Gospel to show that the alarms Spurgeon sounded are equally relevant in the 21st century church.  To prove this point he precedes each chapter with a relevant quote from Spurgeon.<br />MacArthur believes that the root cause of the downgrade of our day is a deep-rooted shame for the gospel.  The church has grown ashamed of the purity and simplicity of the gospel.  In place of traditional \\"old-time religion\\" the church has begun to substitute a \\"show-time religion\\" that focuses on entertainment more than the preaching of the Word.  Pleasing the goats has taken precedent over feeding the sheep - glitter over the gospel.  Doctrinal purity has been replaced by pragmatism, what God commands by what works.<br />The themes of the book are easy to discern from an overview of the chapter titles.  Some of the chapter titles are: Christianity on the Down-Grade, The User-Friendly Church, Gimme That Showtime Religion, All Things To All Men, The Foolishness of God, and I Will Build My Church.<br />Equally fascinating as the book are the appendices.  The first is a history of the Downgrade Controversy, the second an examination of Charles Finney's contribution to pragmatism in the church, the third an essay by the puritan preacher Thomas Boston entitled Carnal vs Spiritual wisdom and the fourth an update on Evangelicals and Catholics Together.  The final appendix is especially interesting as it allows MacArthur a forum to explain how ECT came together and why he stood strong against it.<br />A courageous book that has likely earned MacArthur far more enemies than friends, I highly recommend this book to all believers, both clergy and laity, but especially those who are discontent with much of the modern church-growth movement.  If you have read books like The Purpose Driven Church you owe it to yourself to balance that book with this one.

It seems, though, that the Christian world just laps these books up. Those dealing with Christian living seem to be particularly prone to \\"easy-answerism.\\" Fortunately bestselling author Bill Perkins avoids this concern in his new book entitled Six Battles Every Man Must Win. Based on the Biblical account of King David's mighty men, this book seeks to address the cultural bullies that continually attempt to steal men's hearts. Perkins offers insight on how men can set their sights on God's will for their lives and escape the destructive behavior that is keeping them from being warriors for Him.<br />\\"This book was written for men who...are tired of living like spiritual weaklings. It's for men who believe they were created to be warriors but aren't sure how to fight or what they should be fighting for. It's for men who want to lock on their purpose for living. And it's for men who want to learn ancient secrets from some of the greatest warriors of the Bible: David's special fighting force, the mighty men.\\"<br />For many years our society has told men to cultivate their gentler side and to suppress masculine distinctives. After many years this influence has begun to shape men's identities. Satan builds on this doubt, this disillusion, doing all he can to convince men that they are not warriors at all and that they can play no part in the spiritual battle that rages in this world. Six Battles Every Man Must Win serves as a wake-up call to men who cannot or will not see this conflict.<br /><br />\\"We must wake up. We can no longer deny the reality of the angelic conflict in which we're combatants. We have an enemy who hates us and seeks our destruction. We must discover the secret of masculine strength that's rooted in Christ.\\"<br /><br />Churches, rather than combating the emasculation of men, has contributed by molding the church to create an atmosphere that appeals to women more than men. This process began when men started to forsake their role as the spiritual leaders in the homes and it soon spread to the church. Even Jesus has been given an \\"extreme makeover\\" so that those characteristics he no-doubt possessed that women object to have been downplayed in favor of His gentleness and compassion. As this has happened, the church has ceased teaching godly masculinity so men are unable to resist our society's misconceptions about manliness. The two greatest deceptions are that you are what you own and that you medicate pain with sex. When men lose sight of God's standards for manliness and adopt the world's standards, they give Satan exactly what he is looking for - their hearts. So what are men to do? They are to stand their ground! \\"Recognizing you are engaged in a spiritual battle and deciding to stand your ground are crucial first steps.\\"<br />The subsequent six chapters outline six battles every man needs to face in order to win this spiritual battle. The battles are: Fight for your identity, fight for personal holiness, fight for your family, fight through pain, fight for your friends and fight for a strong faith. Each chapter is based around the struggle and triumph faced by one of David's mighty men. Perkins draws practical, Biblically-sound application from each of their victories. The author avoids attempting to provide easy answers. Like any battle, the battle for holiness of character can be won only through great effort. Instead of easy answers, he provides a solid base of application the reader can build on as he acknowledges and then joins the fight.<br />The book closes not with final answers, but with a final challenge. \\"...enlist right now to fight in the six battles and discover firsthand how God can transform you and use you to strengthen your family and other men. The battle is raging as you read these words...Grab your sword and enter the fight.\\" The bookends with a challenge to begin living a life of greater holiness before God; a challenge to commit my life, my time and my efforts to His cause. It ends with a call for me to be the warrior God intended me to be so that with His help and for His glory I can win the battle that rages all around me and defeat the one who seeks to steal my heart.<br />If I was forced to find a complaint about this book I would say that I was a bit disappointed that it was merely 140 pages long. Several of the chapters provided only an introduction to a topic that I would have liked the author to examine in greater detail. Of course many of the chapters could (and sometimes have been) books of their own so this is probably not practical. I would also have liked to see more exposition of the passage the book is based on. Though most believers have some level of knowledge about David's life, I'm sure many of the references will be lost to readers. Before reading the book I would recommend reading at least 2 Samuel 23: 8-23. For the full story read most of 1 and 2 Samuel.<br />Two things that initially drew me to Perkins' books are his honesty and passion. He draws on many incidents from his own life, being sufficiently honest to use his experiences as examples of behavior others should avoid. He writes with such passion that I could feel the genuine desire he has to see men emerge as the warriors God intended them to be. His passion is contagious.<br />A book that provides many \\"aha\\" moments (as promised on the cover) as well as many opportunities for reflection and discussion, I would recommend this book to men who are seeking to honor God with their lives and are willing to accompany Him into battle.ds with a challenge to begin living a life of greater holiness before God; a challenge to commit my life, my time and my efforts to His cause.

Writing in a simple and straightforward manner, he describes the process of \\"cutting it straight,\\" a term he borrows from Paul's message to Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:15.  Though the passage is most often translated \\"handling accurately the word of truth\\" the literal sense is \\"cutting it straight.\\"  This book is thus divided into three sections.  The first deals with how to make straight cuts, the second with avoiding crooked cuts, and the third with living out your cuts.<br />In the first several chapters Mayhue lays out the proper methods for studying Scripture.  He speaks about presuppositions, methodology and rules for interpretation.  A significant portion of the section is devoted to recommended study tools - concordances, dictionaries, commentaries and so on.<br />The bulk of the book contains rules to avoid making poor cuts.  In other words, the author discusses many of the common errors in interpretation.  The list of errors is extensive, but a few of the topics are: spiritualizing, embellishing, culturalizing, anglicizing and experientializing.  They may seem like difficult terms, but they are all explained in sufficient detail and with plenty of examples.<br />The final chapter provides four pointers for translating straight cuts into a life.  Interpreting Scripture properly is just the first step in allowing the Words of God to penetrate and change our lives.<br />What I most appreciated about this book is that the author provides examples for everything he writes about.  When he discusses rules for interpretation, for example, he exposits Psalm 13, showing how he would go about interpreting this passage.  He shows the questions that should arise when discussing it and how he would answer each of them.  Another strength in this book is the questions at the end of each chapter.  So often I find that the questions authors put in their books add little to the subject, but in this case they truly ensure that the reader has read carefully and understood the content of the chapter.<br />The only shortcoming I found is that the author sometimes does not go into quite enough detail about regular Bible study habits.  I would have appreciated some suggestions on how to begin a regular pattern of inductive Bible study.<br />Despite that small shortcoming, this book is an excellent introduction to the principles of Biblical interpretation and I heartily recommend it.  I would suggest that it might be well complemented by a book that specifically covers the inductive method of Bible study, such as Kay Arthur's \\"How To Study Your Bible.\\"ons authors put in their books add little to the subject, but in this case they truly ensure that the reader has read carefully and understood the content of the chapter.<br />The only shortcoming I found is that the author sometimes does not go into quite enough detail about regular Bible study habits.

I have found few people who are better able to carefully and accurately exposit God's Word.  Because of this ee has become one of my most trusted teachers.<br />The Murder of Jesus showcases exactly what I most admire about MacArthur.  The Murder of Jesus is a fascinating study of last hours of Jesus' life, beginning with the Last Supper and concluding with his death.  It is no coincidence that I decided to read this book around the time that The Passion of the Christ was released for it covers the same period of time, though in far greater detail and with superior accuracy.  The book is filled with interesting insights concerning the plot to kill Jesus and the way the story unfolded.  The author's research leads us through all of the gospels, many of the prophecies concerning Jesus' death and even into the writings of early historians.  While he covers the events, he also shows the theological importance of each of them, whether there were in fulfillment of prophecies or because they supported Jesus' claim to divinity.<br />I would unreservedly recommend this book to anyone who is seeking a deeper understanding of the meaning of Jesus' death.  If you have seen The Passion of the Christ and are looking for answers to your questions about the movie, you could not do much better than this book - it is the best treatment of the subject I have found outside of the Bible.	2004-03-23

This book stands as a call to the church to rediscover the principles upon which the Protestant church was built.  It was Boice's conviction that much of what passes as Christianity today is anything but.  The church will only be able to be an effective witness for God when it returns to the foundation of the five solas that defined the Reformation (Scripture alone, Christ alone, grace alone, faith alone, glory to God alone).<br /><br />The book begins with a critical examination of the modern evangelical church.  The author shows that where the evangelical church was once known for and defined by what it believed, today it is increasingly defined by its style.  He is especially critical of the church growth movement, saying that this movement adjusts Christianity to the desires of our culture.  The modern church does not understand that Christianity can only thrive by offering people not what \\"they already have, but what they so desperately lack - namely, the Word of God and salvation through Jesus Christ.\\"  His thesis (found on page 36) is that \\"the chief problem [with the church] is that we have forgotten God and are not really living for His glory...the reason we do not think about Him is that we have forgotten the meaning and importance of these essential doctrines.\\"  The doctrines he refers to are, of course, the five solas.<br /><br />He turns to an examination of the pattern of this age.  He shows how the world's patterns of secularism, humanism, relativism, materialism and pragmatism have infiltrated the church.  Perhaps even worse is the onset of mindlessness where people in the world and in the church no longer use their minds, deliberately choosing ignorance as a way of life.  Set against these principles are the absolutes of the Reformation which need to be related to our culture in a new and relevant way.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is dedicated to an examination of each of the five principles.  Each section is a fascinating, Scriptural study.  Though he is a theologian, Boice was primarily a pastor and thus a great communicator.  He relates difficult principles in a way that the laity can understand and not become overwhelmed.<br /><br />Having related the principles, Boice spends the final section discussing their application to our worship and to our lives.  I found this section disappointing and for a time was almost convinced that it had been written by a different author.  Where the first part of the book praised the Reformers, this section lauded the pope and Brother Lawrence.  It also seemed to end very suddenly without tying the ideas together and providing a satisfactory conclusion.<br /><br />Regardless of my annoyances with final section I highly recommend this book.  Boice left behind a thought-provoking study of the principles upon which the Protestant church was founded.  He provides a respectful but at times necessarily harsh call for churches to re-examine their principles and determine if they truly are living for God's glory alone.y choosing ignorance as a way of life.

Hostage tells the story of the kidnapping of three American missionaries from a tiny village in the Panamanian jungle. The book is written by Nancy Mankins, wife of Dave Mankins, who along with Mark Rich and Rick Tenenoff was kidnapped by Colombian rebels.<br />The book continually alternates between the day of the kidnapping and the years of preparation that led the Mankins family to become missionaries to the Kuna tribe. We learn about their call to mission work, the decision to leave their life in America and move to the jungles of South America, and the life they built there. We learn about the trials and challenges they faced in trying to adapt to a culture vastly different from their own. The story culminates, of course, in the events of January 31, 1993 when rebels burst into the tiny village and kidnapped the three missionaries.<br />As with most missionary stories, it is inspiring to read about Christians who are so dedicated to God's work that they will leave all the comforts of society to bring the gospel to those who have never had opportunity to hear it. In my view missionaries, God's most humble and unseen disciples, are the true heroes of Christianity - far above the public figures we love to praise.<br />My only real disappointment with the book is that it really isn't a book about hostages at all. The back-story and the story of the day the men went missing fills almost the entire book, leaving just a few pages to tell the little bit their wives know about what happened to the men. Other than that small complaint, I enjoyed Hostage and would recommend it.	2004-01-29

However, I find I am not completely satisfied with it. Primarily I find I am disappointed that the authors have no better solution than bouncing the eyes. I would like to believe that God can truly free men from sexual sin rather than having them lives their lives masking this sin. Perhaps that is simplistic. But can't God free people from the sin that has bound them? I know none of us will ever be sinless, yet I do believe God can set us free from specific sins. The technique the authors espouse seems to leave God's power out of the equation.<br />I also find myself taking offense on behalf of women for much of what the authors teach. For example, they say time and again that men have a 72-hour sexual cycle. Their advice to women is to work with men in this 72-hour cycle. There is very little in the book about building a good sex life where both partners give and receive pleasure. In fact, it seems that the authors believe women are almost asexual and their function in sexual activity is simply to relieve a husband of his sexual burden. On the other hand, the authors present all men as being absolutely controlled by sex. I think this book, when read by women, might really give them an overly-pessimistic view of how men think.<br />A significant concern I had was the many descriptions of the authors' lust. Sometimes they would describe things in such detail that I am concerned the descriptions alone could make men think lustful thoughts. The description of the jogger that one of the authors was staring at when he crashed his car is a good example.<br />In the end I found this book to be deeply flawed and not worth reading.	2004-01-29
US	43519458	RZ8FIV972S69V	0310205719	36906356	The Purpose Driven Life	Books	2	43	51	N	N	Abuses The Bible	There are many reviews here which summarize much of what I discovered about this book, so I will summarize some of my greatest concerns.<br />Thesis<br />Page 25 seems to summarize the thesis of the book. It says \\"We discover that meaning and purpose only when we make God the reference point of our lives.\\" This seems to say that if the reader finds God he will also find himself and his purpose. This is not the gospel!<br />Multiple translations<br />Rick Warren quotes the Bible over 1,200 times in the text of The Purpose Driven Life. To do so, he uses fifteen different translations and paraphrases. Appendix 3 contains his rationale for this and he provides two reasons for the number of translations. The first is that in any single translation \\"nuances and shades of meaning can be missed, so it is always helpful to compare translations.\\" The second is \\"the fact that we often miss the full impact of familiar Bible verses, not because of poor translating, but simply because they have become so familiar.\\" He believes this will \\"help you see God's truth in new, fresh ways.\\"<br />The author's logic is faulty as the two reasons he provides contradict each other. If a translation introduces something in a new and fresh way it will necessarily introduce new nuances and shades of meaning. The way to remove nuances and shades of meaning is to use as literal a translation as possible so that the words are God's alone and are not interpreted by the translator. The author can then exposit the text, clarifying what might require clarification. This is nothing more than the traditional means of teaching what the Bible says.<br />Audience<br />The author aims this book at two distinct audiences - believers and unbelievers. He shows that he is, initially at least, writing for unbelievers by inviting them to pray a short prayer, asking them to say \\"Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you.\\" He then welcomes them to the family of God. I fear, though, that he uses too many Christian terms and phrases to really connect with unbelievers. Similarly, if he is hoping to reach new Christians, I think the same holds true - the \\"Christianese\\" terms and many of the Biblical references may alienate them. On the other hand, if he is hoping to reach mature Christians, much of the book will be too simplistic for them.<br />We know from the Bible that there is a vast difference between believers and unbelievers. Those who have come to a saving knowledge of Christ have had their very natures changed. They have become adopted children of God and have become heirs to His promises. They have special privileges and they have knowledge and faith that unbelievers do not. This is not to say that a book can or should not be written that attempts to reach both audiences. What it does mean is that an author must be sure to distinguish between audiences, being careful not to mislead either audience.<br />Warren often fails to differentiate between audiences. For example, in the second chapter he quotes Ephesians 1:4 which reads \\"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.\\" The context of this verse shows that the author is referring to only Christians, yet Warren makes no distinction.<br />The Gospel<br />The author does not at any time provide a clear explanation of the gospel message. On page 58 he says, \\"Real life begins by committing yourself completely to Jesus Christ\\" but never comes closer than that. He never writes about such crucial doctrines as man's sinfulness and need for a Savior or the work of Jesus. He never mentions the importance Christ's life, the cross or the empty tomb. Yet on page 58 we find him leading the prayer of \\"Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you\\" and then saying \\"Welcome to the family of God!\\" How can a person become a Christian without any understanding of his own sinfulness or of Christ's sacrifice on our behalf?<br />Warren's gospel seems to be one of purpose. He teaches that man's greatest problem is purposelessness and this book will remedy that situation by helping the reader discover his purpose. Needless to say, this is not the gospel as taught by the Bible. The Bible teaches that man's greatest problem is that he is a sinner and is alienated from God. Purposelessness is insignificant compared to the possibility of an eternity in hell.<br />Life Application<br />The aim studying the Bible is application. We are to study the Bible so we can apply what we learn to our lives, with the ultimate aim of conforming ourselves to the image of Christ. Application, though, depends on proper teaching and sound knowledge. It stands to reason that a person cannot apply to his life something he does not understand. Teaching stands as the foundation that application is built upon.<br />Since Warren does not explain the gospel and the real means of salvation, how can people truly apply what he teaches? If everything is application, what do they really believe in?<br />Bible Use<br />We have already seen how the author has used multiple translations as well as his justification for doing so. Of even greater concern is his carelessness in his use of the Bible. He continually removes Scripture passages from their proper context in order to make them suit his purposes. He carelessly applies promises to the reader that clearly do not apply. He also distorts or changes the meanings of certain passages to make them say what he wants them to say.  This is well-documented in other reviews on this site.<br />I can recommend this book only to discerning readers. There is certainly some value in the book, but in my opinion the bad outweighs the good. I would certainly not use this as an introduction to Christianity or as a means of reaching unbelievers.hes that man's greatest problem is purposelessness and this book will remedy that situation by helping the reader discover his purpose.

We quickly learn what behaviour is and is not acceptable when the eyes of our families and friends are on us. But who we are in public is not an accurate guage of our character. Our true character is shown when we are alone and no one is looking. It is at these times that we display our true colours.<br />In Who You Are When No One's Looking, Bill Hybels outlines several character traits that he believes are becoming endangered in our culture and outlines ways we can incorporate these traits into our lives. The traits he focuses on are courage, discipline, vision, endurance and love. Love is so important that he dedicates half of the book to it, dividing it into several kinds of love, namely tender love, tough love, sacrificial love and radical love.<br />Though this book does not arrive at any ground-shaking conclusions, it is well worth reading and would make a fantastic 10-part Bible study. My only real complaint would be a few sentences that undermine Reformed theology (&quot;God loves prisoners, homosexuals and bag ladies as much as he loves stock brokers, dental students and seminarians.)&quot; (p. 62) Of course such beliefs are commonplace in the evangelical world and, frankly, not worth getting too upset about.	2004-01-29

It is indicative of the sorry state of the Christian world that such a book can gain so great a following. The authors misuse the Bible, equate experience with Scripture, and make God into something He is not. They are mystics, relying on their own thoughts more prominently than Scripture. They rely heavily on other mystics, mainly Catholic, such as C.S. Lewis, St John of the Cross, G.K. Chesterton and Phillip Yancey.<br />The authors have two grave misunderstandings that pollute the entire book. First, they have no understanding of human depravity. Where the Bible says that the heart is deceitful and full of wickedness, the authors believe it to be essentially good as long as we understand the importance of a Sacred Romance. Where the Bible teaches that no one seeks after God, the authors teach that all of us seek after God. They quote G.K. Chesterton who said, every man who knocks on the door of a brothel is looking for God. In their view, all we do, whether good or bad, is really a search for God. We all seek after Him, whether we know it or not. Inside of each of us is the desire to know and experience goodness. The second great misunderstanding is in Gods omniscience  His ability to see everything, whether past, present or future. They teach a form of open theism which says that God can only see certain things in the future, but is unable to see what decisions or choices humans will make. Hence God was surprised when humans rejected Him and did not know that Adam and Eve would sin. Of course this contradicts the Bible which says that God knew who would love Him before the world was even created.<br /><br />There are literally hundreds of errors in this book but I will focus only on some of the major ones.<br /> The book is based on the importance of the heart, yet the authors never identify what the heart is. It seems that in their view it represents only good. This blatantly ignores what the Bible teaches about the heart being deceitful and wicked. They teach that it is only wicked when we are outside of the Sacred Romance with God.<br /> The authors paint God as being sad and heartbroken, hoping against hope that we will choose to love Him. It smacks of Arminian theology taken to its fullest extent and reduces God almost to the extent of making Him sound like a whining child.<br /> The teaching that is based on the Bible is often dubious or plain wrong. The authors often quote from The Message, relying on that poor paraphrase when it suits their purposes and when the proper translations do not. This shows especially in Ephesians 1 which they use to say God created the world for our purposes, not Gods. The authors use The Message to teach that Job lost faith in God when a better translation shows he clearly did not. They also say that in Matthew 24 Jesus tells us that in the Last Days people will have lost the Sacred Romance. This is a ridiculous misinterpretation of this chapter.<br /> The book paints God and our relationship with Him in sexual terms. This far exceeds what we read in Song of Solomon and other places in the Bible. The portray God as One who seeks to have an almost sexual relationship with us. He desires from us  an intimacy much more sensuous, more exotic than sex itself.<br /> God is not after obedience, sacrifice or adherence  He is after us. Teaching like this downplays the importance of following Gods decrees for us. This, of course, is a necessary symptom of teaching that does not follow the Bible. When we rely on our minds more than the Bible this type of teaching is inevitable.<br /> The authors rely heavily on the teachings of others as well as books and songs, much more so than they do on the Bible. For example, several pages are dedicated to showing how Lieutenant Jim from Forrest Gump was actually discovering the Sacred Romance through drugs, alcohol and sexwith prostitutes.<br /><br /> There is almost no importance placed on studying the Bible or praying. The tools God gives us to be transformed into His image are ignored in favor of just understanding our hearts and Gods heart. This is a book dedicated to sanctification  the process of living as God desires us to live  that ignores what God Himself teaches about this.<br /> There is no mention of Jesus coming to atone for our sins. The authors seem to say that Jesus had to come to seeks us out and find us  not to save us from hell and take our punishment upon Himself.<br /> A knowledge of God, in the view of the authors, is less important then feeling, experiencing and romanticizing Him. The book bears this out as there is little within it to increase the readers knowledge of God. Yet classic Christianity teaches that we can best learn Gods will for us by having knowledge of Him and what He commands of us.<br />One major annoyance I found with the book was that the authors quoted many sources without citations. This is usually a sign that an author has quoted inaccurately or far out of context. Even many Bible passages are quoted without citations.<br />In the end analysis, the authors have created an inaccurate metaphor for Gods relationship towards us, have attempted to prove it with the Bible and being unable to do so have had to rely on poor paraphrases and mysticism (which can be defined as trying to know God outside of the Bible). Their teaching bears only a vague resemblance to the Christianity of the Bible and should be avoided at all costs!sex with prostitutes.<BR> <BR> There is almost no importance placed on studying the Bible or praying.

Never having heard of Ken Blount I was unsure as to what he was all about, but expected some interesting insights from someone who seems to have for several decades run a successful worship ministry.  Alas, I was wrong.<br /><br />This book is a confused mess of poor theology, bad hermeneutics and some pretty awful teaching.  The few useful teachings are more than overwhelmed by the bad.  The book gets off to a suspicious beginning as the author recounts an experience where the Lord supposedly gave him a prophetic song in a situation he describes as his \\"most powerful encounter with God's manifest presence.\\"  A few pages later he describes his wife's conversion experience where she was not content just to give her life to the Lord but also insisted that she speak in tongues as well.  He attributes his later conversion to his wife's \\"sneaky Christianity\\" where she would lay hands on him and pray over him in tongues while he was sleeping.  Later on he teaches that worshipping God in spirit (John 4:24) means \\"to pray in the Spirit in other tongues.\\"  Doing this will activate your \\"spirit man.\\"  In another place he says that Jesus had the \\"gift of the Spirit called the word of knowledge\\" which enabled him to get people's attention (specifically the woman at the well in John 4).<br /><br />A large portion of the book is dedicated to an explanation of the Old Testament tabernacle and how it was a shadow of New Testament worship.  His explanation is faulty and borders on the bizarre in many places.<br /><br />For sake of brevity I will leave it at that.<br /><br />The book is not all bad.  The author does make some interesting and valid points.  For example, he discusses the importance of worship in the dry times of life and the importance of being on guard for unbiblical manifestations of the Spirit.  But in the end, the bad so far outweighs the good that I cannot recommend this book.	2004-01-27

I have been told of the importance of spending time each day reading God's Word, meditating on it and even memorizing it, but I do not ever recall being taught how to systematically study it.<br />After explaining this predicament to a friend of mine, she recommended the inductive Bible study approach, which she had only just discovered through buying the New Inductive Study Bible.  Kay Arthur edited that version of the Bible and knowing she was a proponent of the inductive method, I decided to read How To Study Your Bible by Arthur.<br />I do not intend to go into detail about the Inductive method of Bible study.  There is any number of resources available in bookstores and online that can outline the method in detail.  Essentially, though, it begins with understanding the context of the big picture (the Bible) then works to the smaller picture (a specific book of the Bible) and so on until the study leads to specific words.  The method relies heavily on note-taking and Bible marking.  There is a whole system of Bible marking that Arthur recommends which helps in identifying themes and patterns.  The appendices are filled with useful information about how to best use concordances and expository dictionaries.  They even go into some detail about the tenses, moods and voices of Greek verbs!<br />Although the book sometimes appears as an advertisement for the New Inductive Study Bible, it does a fantastic job of outlining the method and rationale for the inductive approach to Bible study.  This book is a valuable resource and I highly recommend it.	2004-01-27

Though written over twenty years ago, this book is as relevant to the Christian world today as it was then.  The edition I read is the second edition, which was updated and published in 1992.<br />In recent years the Charismatic movement has completely infiltrated the church.  Aspects of the movement are visible in almost every denomination.  And as the movement grows in strength and acceptance it becomes more and more bizarre.  It is not unusual to hear about flat tires being healed, fillings in teeth being turned to gold and other baffling (and unproven) phenomena.  Almost any time of day or night there is a channel showing a faith healer healing with a touch or knocking people to the ground.  Left unchecked, the movement will continue to grow and spread, becoming ever more strange.<br />The main issues MacArthur focuses on are modern day prophecies, ongoing revelation, Biblical interpretation, miracles, healings, tongues, and the \\"health and wealth\\" gospel.  Ultimately, his arguments against these are based on a few points of doctrine.<br />First and foundationally, MacArthur teaches that experience cannot be accepted as a valid test of truth.  Experience is only valid if it conforms to God's word.  This is hardly groundbreaking theology, yet is theology that has been forsaken by many Christian churches.  Experiences can never be held as co-equal in importance to the Bible.  Where there is a conflict the Bible must always prevail.<br />Second, he teaches that God's inspired revelation ended with the closing of Scripture.  Though God still reveals Himself, He no longer does so in an inspired way.  Therefore, no other revelation can be held equal to the Bible.  This puts all other revelation in subjection to Biblical principles.<br />Third, he teaches that the signs and wonders done by the apostles ended with the end of the apostolic era.  These were signs given by God to achieve a specific purpose.  They were given to prove that the apostles were God's messengers on earth and that they were trustworthy sources of teaching.  MacArthur shows how even through the Bible we see the signs disappearing so that even before the close of Scripture with the writing of the book of Revelation, these signs and miracles had ceased.  This does not mean that God can no longer perform miraculous deeds.  It does mean, though, that God no longer uses men to initiate these miracles as he did in Biblical times.  Speaking in tongues also falls into the category of gifts that were given by God for a short time and a specific purpose.<br />MacArthur deals lovingly yet necessarily harshly with the Charismatic movement.  He pulls no punches in rooting out the teachings that he considers dangerous.  He does this all from a very simple, Biblical viewpoint.  He does not waver in his view that the Charismatic teachings go directly against the pure simplicity of the gospel.<br />A fantastic Biblical examination of the Charismatic movement, this book comes with my emphatic recommendation.principles.  <br />Third, he teaches that the signs and wonders done by the apostles ended with the end of the apostolic era.

There are others that I can pour over hour after hour and still feel like I am only scratching the surface of the book.  Evangelical  Hermeneutics falls into the latter category.  Though not an easy read, this book is rewarding.<br /><br />Hermeneutics is one of the steps used in interpreting and studying the Bible.  Specifically, the author defines it as \\"a set of principles for interpreting the Bible.\\"  Once a passage has been properly interpreted, meaning and application can be drawn from it.  It stands to reason that if the principles of interpretation are wrong, the meaning and application are likely to be wrong as well.  What the author seeks to show is how these principles have changed over the past decades and the effect that is having on Christianity today.<br /><br />The author's goal for this book is fourfold:<br />-To discuss the recent changes in recent hermeneutics<br />-To show new meanings being attached to grammatical-historical interpretation<br />-To compare traditional grammatical-historical interpretation with new evangelical hermeneutics<br />-To identify the dominant principles of new evangelical hermeneutics<br /><br />Robert Thomas believes strongly in the value of the traditional form of hermeneutics, known as the grammatical-historical method.  Throughout the books he cites examples of modern theologians who have either wrongly applied grammatical-historical principles or have invented new methods of hermeneutics.  More importantly, he shows the effects these people have had on the Christian world.  He focuses specifically on several issues: feminism, open theism, missiology, theonomy and a few others.  One of the more fascinating chapters deals with dynamic equivalence (which is a method of Bible translation) and how it is not as much a method of translation as a set of hermeneutical principles.  Some of the other topics that caught my attention were preunderstanding and the New Testament use of the Old Testament.<br /><br />There are several applications to my life and my faith that I have taken from this book.  First, it has solidified my understanding of the principle of single meaning, which states that each passage in the Bible has one and only one meaning.  Second, it has helped me see the value of the grammatical-historical method.  Though this is the system I have adhered to in the past, I am now more confident that it is the most Scriptural method.  Third, I see the importance of removing all possible preunderstanding before I examine a text.  What I mean by this, is if I am going to examine what the Bible says about the role of women in ministry, I need to look at the passages to determine what they mean, not what they say about women's roles.  It is a subtle but important difference.  Finally, I have come to understand more clearly the Holy Spirit's role in helping me understand the Bible.<br /><br />I can't deny that at times I felt lost in this book, primarily because the book presupposes a greater grasp of hermeneutics than I currently have.  The other reason is that it spends a lot of time discussing the end-times and that is not a topic I have studied in great depth.  The author also tends to use words without fully defining them.  An example is the word \\"meaning\\" which he defines as \\"the author's truth intention.\\"  \\"Truth intention\\" is not a phrase I am familiar with, though perhaps if I was more familiar with hermeneutics I would be.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand how Scripture is supposed to be used.  Realize, though, that it does help to have a solid understanding of hermeneutics before reading it.  I suspect I will be returning to this book often as I study the Word.at caught my attention were preunderstanding and the New Testament use of the Old Testament.<br /><br />There are several applications to my life and my faith that I have taken from this book.

The author proceeds from the foundation that much of what we do and see in today's churches is derived from 17th to 19th century culture, and as such has lost much of its relevance to our postmodern society.  We need to critically examine our churches to discern to the world today and what is simply tradition holding over from days gone by.<br />White draws heavily on the writings of Rick Warren, Bill Hybels and George Barna: so heavily, in fact, that it often seems he has little to say that is truly original.  If you have read The Purpose Driven Church and are familiar with Hybels' writings, you will find a lot of repetition in this book.  Still, at only 128 pages it is an easy read and still worth your while.  If you have not read books on this topic before, this makes an excellent introduction.<br />This book does a good job of showing the importance and, to some extent, the methodology of taking a critical look at the church to evaluate if it truly is an effective tool for God's work.  I appreciated that on the whole the author treats the traditional church with respect, seeing the beauty of traditional parts of the worship service and traditional music.  At the same time I appreciated his harshness on the necessity of being willing to make changes where changes are necessary.	2004-01-27

I'm not sure if it was the picture of Greg Laurie sitting on his Harley that turned me off (to my shame) or if it was that I had just read The Purpose Driven Church and I didn't much want to hear another theory on church growth.  My first two minutes of reading only confirmed my irrational preconceptions.  Laurie begins his book by listing the accomplishments of his church (Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, California).  Over fifteen thousand attend the church every week; three to four thousand come to Christ every year through those services and so on.  This all seemed a little self-serving to me.  He then describes the unusual way he was thrust into the ministry.<br />Laurie spends the next 200 pages laying out the principles he used to grow his church from a small Bible study of 30 converted hippies to a thriving fellowship of over fifteen thousand.  What is shocking about the book is not the success of his church or that God could take a man from such humble beginnings and grant him great success.  What is shocking is that the church exploded in growth and continues to grow without applying any of the principles deemed so important by today's church growth experts.  Harvest Fellowship has never advertised in any way.  They have never done community surveys, have never sent flyers out to the homes around their church and have never even placed an advertisement in the local newspaper.  Their growth has come entirely from the people within the church living out the Great Commission.<br />The title of the book reveals a truth about the Christian life and a truth about Harvest Fellowship.  Christians are called to live their lives in a way that appears to the world to be upside down.  Only an upside down heart could love an enemy and turn the other cheek.  The other truth contained in the title is that Greg Laurie's church has used church growth methods that are upside down when compared to today's church grown models (The Purpose Driven model would be an example).  Where these models insist that the only way to be relevant to a culture is to study it, interview the people and then meet their felt needs, Harvest Fellowship's approach has simply been to live out the Great Commission.<br />What I undoubtedly appreciated most about The Upside Down Church is that every point the author makes is drawn from Scripture.  His method of church growth is based very simply on a keen understanding of the early church and an emphasis on studying and applying Scripture.  This compares favorably with a book like The Purpose Driven Church, which draws heavily on marketing and business models, at least as heavily as it draws on the Bible.  Laurie spends a entire chapter of the book discussing the problems with treating the unbelievers a church hopes to reach as  \\"consumers\\" rather than \\"communers.\\"  Laurie also turns to prominent preachers of the past such as Tozer and Spurgeon, whom he quotes extensively, to lend support to his methods.<br />The only real disappointment in the book was that Laurie did not spend more time giving specific tips for growing and mobilizing a church.  He provides many underlying principles but is somewhat short on specifics.  But maybe it is better that way, as no two churches will ever be the same and the specifics of Harvest Fellowship may not apply outside of that congregation.<br />In the final analysis The Upside Down Church is a book I would highly recommend to any believer, especially pastors or aspiring pastors.  I can not say if his church growth model is any more or less effective than the more popular models, the fact that it draws entirely on Scripture gives me confidence that God will bless it.  It is well worth the read, and weighing in at only 219 pages it is an easy read.upside down when compared to today's church grown models (The Purpose Driven model would be an example).

A bold statement, I know, but it truly is an incredible book.  I certainly would not say it is the best book I've ever read, nor the most profound.  But what this book does, and does very well, is set forth in a clear and unequivocal manner, the evidence that Christ existed and that He was exactly who and what He said He was.<br />The book follows journalist Lee Strobel on his quest to discover the truth about Jesus.  His quest begins with his wife's conversion to Christianity.  A staunch atheist, he noticed her life begin to change and through her silent witness started to realize that something real had happened in her life.  So, using his skills as a journalist, he set out to find out who Jesus really was.  Though he read many books and journals dealing with Jesus, The Case For Christ is essentially a record of his interviews with thirteen eminent scholars, each of whom is an expert in a different area relating to Jesus.  Strobel examined, among other things, the life of Jesus, who Jesus said He was, who others said Jesus was and the accuracy of the Scriptures.  His examination is detailed and conclusive and ultimately he leaves it to the reader to decide what to do with the evidence.<br />This book is very well written and can be studied over a course of weeks or read in a couple of evenings.  It is a fantastic read for Christians who are interested in learning more about the origins, accuracy and uniqueness of the Bible.  It is also an excellent choice for anyone seeking to know more about Christianity and wishing to undertake an examination of the case for Christ.	2004-01-27

To that end I purchased \\"When Good Men Are Tempted\\" by Bill Perkins.  It is an honest and often disturbing look at the subject.  The book claims that \\"Bill Perkins details a plan for sexual integrity - one that works. He shows men how to achieve a purity that will preserve the sanctity of their marriages, the security of their families, the vitality of their walks with God, and the strength of their relationships with their brothers in Christ.\\"<br /><br />The book begins with an attempt to understand the struggle men face.  Perkins shows why naked women look so good and why other naked women look even better than our wives.  He speaks of the addictive cycle of trying to repeat \\"young love\\" or our first sexual experiences.  We want to be able to relive the original excitement we felt during those often illicit experiences.  He illustrates these concepts with the example of Samson.<br /><br />The author's solution to this problem surrounding lust is simply to raise the white flag.  We need to surrender to God and admit the problem rather than run from it or try to hide it.  Lust, he says, cannot be overpowered, reformed or starved.  It needs to be dealt with and dealt with now!  To be dealt with it needs to be dragged into the light so we can deal with the shame and guilt.  We need to admit specific sins to God and ask Him for His forgiveness.<br /><br />The close of this section contains a chapter regarding families of origin.  This chapter is confusing and often left me confused as the author discussed the codependent roles we assumed as part of our families and how this leads to problems with purity later in life.<br /><br />Having admitted the struggle, we are now able to find freedom.  To do this we must choose our master and count the cost of the one we will choose.  To cease a lifestyle of lust the cost of continuing needs to be higher than the cost of quitting.  We need to see that continuing in a lifestyle will have consequences in our relationships with our families, our spouses and most importantly, with God.  We need to realize that God can fix us and that He wants to fix us.  As He fixes us He will help us discover the new men we are through Him.  Through Him we have a new perspective, new presence and new power.  With these we can now begin to break the addictive cycle that continually leads us to sin.  The practical suggestions the author provides are: memorize Scripture, call on God and find what rituals lead us to sin and learn to break those rituals.<br /><br />The final section focuses mostly on building accountability relationships with other men.  Every man needs ally himself with a small group of men who can help him win the battle against lust by holding him accountable.  There is a small section about sex and ideas for spicing up a sex life, followed by a chapter detailing some \\"tools for tight corners\\" that can be used in a moment of weakness.<br /><br />The book is written in a personable way that leaves the reader feeling like he has had a personal chat with the author.  Perkins admits his own weaknesses, leaving the reader comfortable admitting his own.  Perhaps the greatest strength in this book is the emphasis on the \\"why\\" of sexual temptation.  Having an understanding of the reasons behind temptation gives a solid perspective on how to deal with it.  The author does not attempt to blame our lust on Satan, but emphasizes that our sin is ultimately our own and we need to deal with it.  If the emphasis on the \\"why\\" is the strong point of the book, I would suggest that the \\"how\\" is the weak point.  It may be, though, that I am looking for a magical key to stopping sinful behavior.  Still, as with Every Man's Battle I am left hoping that God truly can remove this sin, rather than just masking it and helping us deal with it time and time again.<br /><br />In the end, this book does a far better job of dealing with the subject than \\"Every Man's Battle\\" and it receives my recommendation.end, this book does a far better job of dealing with the subject than \\"Every Man's Battle\\" and it receives my recommendation.	2004-01-27

That is not to say, though, that it is not an excellent book.  I read this book in the hopes that it would coach me on methods for more fulfilling Bible study.  It turns out, though, that the bulk of this book is dedicated to why I should study the Bible with only minimal emphasis on how I should study it.  Though at first I was disappointed, I came to see that this book is full of truth and may be one of the best books I have read about truly understanding the Bible.  I have little doubt that the emphasis on what the Bible is will prove more valuable to me than a book filled with advice on how to study Scripture.<br /><br />First I am going to state my complaints with this book.  Primarily, I felt the title misleading.  The book seems to say it is a \\"how\\" book but in reality is more of a \\"why\\" book.  Second, it seems that the book's publication coincided with the publication of The MacArthur Study Bible and How To Get The Most From God's Word sometimes seems to be little more than an advertisement for it.  There are at least 12 references to The MacArthur Study Bible and that not-so-subtle advertising cheapens the book, making it feel more than a little self-serving.<br /><br />Complaints aside, this book speaks of some awesome truths about God's Word.  The author evidently believes that the Bible can only be truly appreciated when the reader understands its value, beauty and necessity.  To that end he first explains how and why we can trust the Bible.  He speaks about the Bible's origins and inspiration and how we can have comfort in the fact that the Bible is true.  He then turns to an exploration of what the Bible can do for us.  He shows that it can change us, make us free, reveal God's will, help us grow spiritually and prepare us for spiritual battle.  Building on this foundation, the final section, which unfortunately is only a few pages long, provides practical tips for studying the Bible.<br /><br />The highlight of this book is the chapter on spiritual warfare.  Through a careful exposition of Paul's teaching about the sword of the Spirit in Ephesians 6, MacArthur shows the power and necessity of the Bible in defeating Satan.  He shows that it is not only a defensive weapon, but also an offensive weapon - the only offensive weapon in our arsenal.  Another important section is the one dealing with proper Biblical interpretation.  The author's teachings about how not to interpret the Bible are important today when so many Christian teachers are using the Bible in any way they want with little regard to its true meaning and with even less regard for proper methodology.<br /><br />This book left me with a greater appreciation of the Bible and certainly with a greater love for it.  The author's long list of reasons for why I should love it, study it and rely on it left me with a greater understanding of the priceless treasure God has given us in His Word.

The book is aimed at a Christian audience and is not so much a defense of creationism as it is a defense of a literal six-day creation. This is not a book that primarily focuses on convincing unbelieving evolutionists of creationism, but rather it focuses on convincing Christians who believe that in some form of evolution (such as old-earth creationism or the Gap Theory) that the only valid reading of Genesis one and two is a literal reading. MacArthur bases much of the book on the view that Evolution is itself a religion that is completely opposed to Christianity. Creationism and Evolution, therefore, can never be mixed. We must believe in either one or the other.<br />After giving many reasons why Evolutionism is antithetical to God and His design, the book spends a chapter on each of the days of creation. In each chapter the author shows why anything other than a literal six-day creation is impossible. In so doing he gives many wonderful examples of the wonders and marvels of creation. Much of the book is focused on refuting the arguments of Hugh Ross, the most prominent of the theistic evolutionists.<br />I would highly recommend this book to any believer that is struggling with the conflict between creationism and evolutionism. MacArthur's ability to accurately draw teaching from scripture and using God's word as the ultimate teaching tool makes this one of the best books I have read on the subject.	2004-01-27

As such, we would expect him to have many interesting insights into church growth.  He does not disappoint.  In Surprising Insights From The Unchurched Rainer presents the results of a fascinating study he performed over two years.  He decided that perhaps the best way of learning what principles of church growth work best would be to interview people who had only recently become Christians and begun to attend church on a regular basis.  He and his team spent thousands of hours interviewing 353 of these people.  And the results, as is obvious from the title of the book, are quite surprising.  In the second half of the book, the focus turns to pastors of successful evangelical churches and seeks to understand what they do to bring success to their churches.<br />The interviews performed by Rainer were focused on members of \\"effective evangelistic churches.\\"  Rainer defines these as churches with at least twenty-six conversions per year and a conversion ratio (membership/annual conversion) of less than 20:1.  The average ratio in American churches is approximately 85:1.  The two criteria eliminate 96% of churches.  This leaves the elite 4% as the focus of the study.<br />Through about 125 pages, Rainer reveals the results of his study.  He begins by shattering myths about the unchurched.  For example, his study found that the name of the church had almost no influence on the unchurched as they chose a church to attend.  The pastor does not need to be a dynamic and charismatic leader for the church to reach the unchurched, and deep and complex Biblical truths do not turn the unchurched away.  These insights seem to fly in the face of many principles associated the church growth movement.  The factors that led people to choose a church were primarily the pastor and his preaching followed closely by solid, Biblical doctrine.  Those two factors rated far ahead of any others.  Once again, those would seem to contradict much of the church growth movement.  Doctrine is so important that Rainer devotes an entire chapter to it.<br />The second part of the book is devoted to insights gleaned from approximately 100 ministers who pastor effective evangelistic churches.  The insights gained from these pastors are also fascinating.  Perhaps the most interesting element of this section of the book is \\"Fifteen Lessons from the Leaders Whose Churches Reach the Unchurched.\\"  In this section, Rainer outlines fifteen lessons he learned in interviewing these men.  He speaks of authenticity, the imperative of person evangelism, the need to retain strong doctrine and many other critical points.  He also devotes attention to their leadership skills and preaching style.<br />If ever I feel I have done injustice to a book in a review of it, this is it.  Honestly, there are so many important principles in this book that they simply cannot be narrowed down to a few short paragraphs.  This book is a treasure trove of information about the ways the most successful churches reach the unchurched.

Though in the media his story is often related as a meteoric rise to stardom, we learn that it was only through time, perseverance and God's grace that Warner ever got a chance to live out his dream.<br /><br />I was drawn to Kurt Warner's story for several reasons.  First, I am a fan of the St Louis Rams, the team with which Warner has had his success.  Second, I love stories about underdogs, and Warner's story is just that.  Third, I love to read about other Christians and the experiences that shaped them.<br /><br />Kurt Warner was an underdog and no stranger to rejection.  For years he faced rejection as he tried to live out his dream of playing professional football.  He was turned down by the major colleges, eventually ending up at the University of Northern Iowa where he spent three years being a backup and only one year leading the team.  When he graduated he went undrafted in the NFL entry draft and was passed up by every professional league.  This went on for several years until finally he accepted a position as quarterback in the lowly Arena League.  After two seasons of leading the Iowa Barnstormers, he was given a chance to play in NFL Europe and finally, at the age of twenty seven, was picked up by the St Louis Rams.  He spent his first season in the big leagues as a third string quarterback and saw action in only one game.  By the 1999 season he had moved up to the position of backup quarterback, and after an injury to the primary quarterback, found himself right where he wanted to be.  He was untested, unproven and no one believed he would make an impact.<br /><br />Who could have foreseen the season Warner would have?  Warner's 1999 season was one of the most successful seasons ever for a quarterback and the most successful for the Rams as Warner led the team to a Superbowl victory while picking up the league's Most Valuable Player award.<br /><br />Kurt Warner is a Christian and credits his faith for his success.  He never misses an opportunity to tell others about his faith and is probably the most vocal Christian professional athlete.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed the story, I found the book poorly written.  It used many colloquialisms and it is not unusual to read sentences such as, \\"They were like, `Yeah right.'\\"  He also speaks about being \\"totally bummed out.\\"  Warner also comes across as a tad pretentious and proud.  I believe he is a humble man who is well aware of Who is responsible for his success, but does not always convey that as accurately as he might like.<br /><br />All-in-all this is an enjoyable book and represents what is hopefully only the first chapter of Warner's career.  He is a man who has faced countless hardships and has persevered in faith.  If sports figures are to be role models in our society, I am glad that there are men like Warner who proudly proclaim their faith.<br /><br />Note.  The book ends at the end of the 1999 season.  The next season Warner was very good, but missed several games due to injuries.  In 2001 he again led his team to the Superbowl but lost the big game when New England scored a last-second field goal.  In 2002 he missed more than half the season to injuries and looked very bad when he was playing.  In 2003 he won the starter's job, but played terribly and was benched after the first game.  It is expected that 2004 will find him on a new team where he will have the change to be a starter once again.credits his faith for his success.

It is expected that 2004 will find him on a new team where he will have the change to be a starter once again.	2004-01-27

I began several times, but each time found I was missing some important aspect of it.  I believe the source of my trouble is that I read this book only after reading many others that came after.  If I had read this book when it was published (1986) I would seen it as groundbreaking.  But today, when we are surrounded by books on the principles of church growth, this book does not seem to have much new to add.<br /><br />One thing that is unique about this book is that it was written by a Presbyterian pastor who also taught at Westminster Theological Seminary.  Though church growth and large churches are generally associated with evangelicalism, this book details the rise of a large Reformed church.  Also, this book deals with outgrowing an existing church whereas many newer books that discuss church growth do so from a church-planting perspective.<br /><br />The book traces John C. Miller's growing awareness of the problem of ingrownness in his calling as a pastor.  Naturally his church was only as good as its leader and it also suffered from ingrownness.  We see the discoveries the pastor made that led him to outgrowing his ingrown church.  The author's journey began with a breakdown as he grew frustrated with his church and with being a pastor, so left the ministry.  During a time of searching he came to realize that as pastor he was the source of the problem and to build his church into one motivated to carry out the Great Commission he would need to make changes.  He details this journey and in so doing challenges others to discover the power of God rather than attempting to abide in their own power and with their own resources.<br /><br />Though a good book full of solid teaching, I believe it would best serve as an introduction to church growth and to outgrowing a stagnant church.  If you have read other books on the subject this many not excite you very much.  Those wary of evangelicalism may also find comfort in the fact that this is written from a Reformed perspective.  When it comes to specifics about church growth there have been many books written since this one that will probably prove more useful.very much.

To that end I purchased \\"When Good Men Are Tempted\\" by Bill Perkins.  It is an honest and often disturbing look at the subject.  The book claims that \\"Bill Perkins details a plan for sexual integrity - one that works. He shows men how to achieve a purity that will preserve the sanctity of their marriages, the security of their families, the vitality of their walks with God, and the strength of their relationships with their brothers in Christ.\\"<br /><br />The book begins with an attempt to understand the struggle men face.  Perkins shows why naked women look so good and why <em>other</em> naked women look even better than our wives.  He speaks of the addictive cycle of trying to repeat \\"young love\\" or our first sexual experiences.  We want to be able to relive the original excitement we felt during those often illicit experiences.  He illustrates these concepts with the example of Samson.  <br /><br />The author's solution to this problem surrounding lust is simply to raise the white flag.  We need to surrender to God and admit the problem rather than run from it or try to hide it.  Lust, he says, cannot be overpowered, reformed or starved.  It needs to be dealt with and dealt with now!  To be dealt with it needs to be dragged into the light so we can deal with the shame and guilt.  We need to admit specific sins to God and ask Him for His forgiveness.<br /><br />The close of this section contains a chapter regarding families of origin.  This chapter is confusing and often left me confused as the author discussed the codependent roles we assumed as part of our families and how this leads to problems with purity later in life.<br /><br />Having admitted the struggle, we are now able to find freedom.  To do this we must choose our master and count the cost of the one we will choose.  To cease a lifestyle of lust the cost of continuing needs to be higher than the cost of quitting.  We need to see that continuing in a lifestyle will have consequences in our relationships with our families, our spouses and most importantly, with God.  We need to realize that God can fix us and that He wants to fix us.  As He fixes us He will help us discover the new men we are through Him.  Through Him we have a new perspective, new presence and new power.  With these we can now begin to break the addictive cycle that continually leads us to sin.  The practical suggestions the author provides are: memorize Scripture, call on God and find what rituals lead us to sin and learn to break those rituals.<br /><br />The final section focuses mostly on building accountability relationships with other men.  Every man needs ally himself with a small group of men who can help him win the battle against lust by holding him accountable.  There is a small section about sex and ideas for spicing up a sex life, followed by a chapter detailing some \\"tools for tight corners\\" that can be used in a moment of weakness.<br /><br />The book is written in a personable way that leaves the reader feeling like he has had a personal chat with the author.  Perkins admits his own weaknesses, leaving the reader comfortable admitting his own.  Perhaps the greatest strength in this book is the emphasis on the \\"why\\" of sexual temptation.  Having an understanding of the reasons behind temptation gives a solid perspective on how to deal with it.  The author does not attempt to blame our lust on Satan, but emphasizes that our sin is ultimately our own and we need to deal with it.  If the emphasis on the \\"why\\" is the strong point of the book, I would suggest that the \\"how\\" is the weak point.  It may be, though, that I am looking for a magical key to stopping sinful behavior.  Still, as with Every Man's Battle I am left hoping that God truly can remove this sin, rather than just masking it and helping us deal with it time and time again.<br /><br/>In the end, this book does a far better job of dealing with the subject than \\"Every Man's Battle\\" and it receives my recommendation.	2004-01-26

I would be hard-pressed to think of a person who lived since the time of Christ that so fully embodied the qualities and character of a Christian.  He was a man who lived with humble faith and firm convictions and seemed always to direct himself by what was right.<br /><br />Perhaps no other character in history other than Jesus has been written about as much as Abraham Lincoln.  There are literally hundreds of books that trace his life, from its humble beginnings in the backwoods of Kentucky to its conclusion at the hands of an assassin.  This book does not attempt to provide an exhaustive biography of his life.  Rather, it traces the growth of Lincoln as a Christian.  It traces the roots of his faith in the teachings of his mother and shows how his faith was tested and sharpened through his life.  It shows how the wisdom which made him famous was godly wisdom, learned through a lifetime of humility and submission to God.<br /><br />Perhaps the most striking thing about Lincoln's life is that while he lived a life of moral purity that would be the envy of man Christians, for the greater part of his life he was not a believer.  It was only near the end, riding across the battlefield at Gettysburg to deliver his famous address, that he could say he fully dedicated himself to God.  Though he was a good man and a moral man, he did not actually become a Christian until that time.  Through his life prior to that time it was his mother's faith and her teaching that had carried him through life's trials and temptations.<br /><br />The author's extensive research has led him to pivotal moments in Lincoln's faith.  The most important influence was his mother, who raised Lincoln with awe for and respect of the Bible.  His mother, who died when Lincoln was just a young boy, made him promise that he would live as she had taught him and to keep the Lord's commandments.  This promise shaped his life as many times in life he overcame temptation by thinking of his mother's words.  Other pivotal moments in his life were the death of his fianc&eacute;e and the later death of his son.  Both of these events shook him to the core of his being, but God sent people into his life to comfort him and minister to him during these times.  In the end, we see, these events left him stronger and helped lead him to making a commitment to God.<br /><br />When we trace Lincoln's life we can see how God was preparing him for the task He had appointed to him - the task of saving the nation.  We see how the development of his character, his faith and his relationships all led to him becoming a great statesman.  We see how these elements brought him through this time and how he stood firm in them until the time of his death.  It was these elements that made him one of the most beloved men in the nation's history.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln serves as an inspiration to me.  I dream of being a man of Lincoln's character and dream of being able to write and express myself as Lincoln did.  I dream of having his simple, humble wisdom.<br /><br />This book is well-written, well-researched and well-documented.  I give it my highest recommendation.vercame temptation by thinking of his mother's words.  Other pivotal moments in his life were the death of his fiancée and the later death of his son.
