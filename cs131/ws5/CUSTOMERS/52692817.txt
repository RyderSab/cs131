It was a fairy tale with fairy tales from different worlds interwoven within the story. Not to mention the fantasy world the story takes place in. The cover art is beautiful and sort of alludes to the wonderful make-believe land inside. A lovelost prince, a determined princess, ogres, one-eyed kings, dragons, aged wizards, etc. all lead you on a merry odessey of the human heart.	2004-10-24

I really can't say all the amazing things about the story. But the world McKillip created was very \\"realistic\\" with detail and dream-like wordings. It felt like the story could be expanded, but then was abruptly cut off at the end. The end just ended---it didn't really conclude as much as I would've liked. Is this normal for this author? But truly, it was a masterful story. <br />I really enjoyed the part about the sleeping ruler in the cave who is buried at the base of the city. The ruler awakens when trouble threatens its kingdom. It made me think of Arthur and I liked that. <br />An orphaned girl lives and translates in the palace library. One day she is given a book of thorns that \\"speaks\\" to her... <br />her story is entertwined with the new queens, and the mages of the Floating School.  <br />	2004-10-04

Helen Fielding, you mean to tell me that my overactive imagination can get me a spy job?! Yeehaw!  <br /> <br />Its readable, a bit slow in the beginning, but enjoyable all the same. Keeps your interest and is a bit sensational. (And why not?) It seems Olivia has built up all these talents and lifeskills to become an instant recruit for MI6. She chases after hunky men, the hunky men chase after her. Shipboard romances, globetrotting, money, designer clothes, scuba diving, etc. Olivia does it all in quirky little novel that would make great aquatic (bubble bath, poolside, beach) reading.	2004-09-27

I have been a fan since \\"Relic,\\" and I have to say that I thought \\"Brimstone\\" was a bit slower paced than the others. <br />There is just too much dialogue. I kept waiting to get to the scary, intense part. It happened maybe once. Then I kept wondering if they were setting up characters and changing the tone of their stories. Perhaps the indestructible Pendergast and his sidekick are the modern day Holmes and Watson? <br />I wasn't thrilled or scared. The whole set up of the story is okay; but it really doesn't go much into the whole aspect of \\"Brimstone.\\"  <br />PS Since others are pointing out discrepancies, I noticed that D'Agosta had a daughter, Isabella, in \\"REliquary.\\" Woops! <br />But don't worry. They are still great authors and not every story has to be excellent. \\"Relic\\" and \\"Thunderhead\\" scared the pants off me!	2004-08-21

I think the author used the title just to grab our attention. Duh! Of course there aren't any cannibals in the book--you can tell if you read the back cover. This is a humorous, fascinating look into an island who is responding---or not, to Americanization. Its a look into how a modern young, educated couple could survive in the Tropics, if they really could persevere. I don't know if I could've made it through all that the author and his beloved Sylvia could have. The trials and tribulations they go through are just----winsome. Its like an anthropology lesson and a comic book; the author has done his research and has also maintained a respect for his subject.<BR>This book is &quot;light&quot; meaning that you can easily read it and enjoy it at the pool or at the beach. I recommend an outside setting when you read it. It adds to the ambiance that is set up.<BR>I recommend this story---and look forward to more if the author feels duty bound to write another in say, 10 years or so. Its an unusual type of book, but its worth the read. I'm sharing it with my friends and family!	2004-07-12

It was the authors first and you could totally tell, but it was well written. Everyone has got to start out somewhere and she did a marvelous job. She also got a great artist for her cover---what drew me more to the story than anything else.(!) Angarrad is a strong character; the story rambles and covers a lot of ground, kills off a main character, alas!, and still managed to keep entertained to the end. I look forward to reading future works.	2004-06-26

Is that really a story?&quot; Coming from the man who wrote, &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; anything is possible. Its quite short and quite disturbing. After finishing the story, I didn't want to turn out the light. But nothing was going to get me! It wasn't the same horror as a classic horror movie, slash and trash the girl... It was almost like a &quot;threatening&quot; horror. <BR>What would happen if women lost everything---what if it were all taken away and replaced with what your husband and children want as a wife and mother? It makes me think about how central a womans role is in her household....the whole story makes me think---totally! Disturbing, very disturbing. I can't help but wonder what a man would feel and say about this, or a woman who has grown children and a lifelong relationship with her husband. Would these people feel powerless, unsettled? Or just creeped out with a smile on their face? Whatever the feeling, the marvelous and unusual feeling, this story evokes these strongly in me. It was published the year I was born....	2004-06-26

It has some of the same appeal to it, medieval books and mysteries, etc. but none of the flowing appeal. I could tell that there were two authors---look at the first two paragraphs---they completely sound different. At times the writing is flowery, other times very descriptive. It gave me the case of the double takes. I was reading this book in sync with a friend who LOVED THIS BOOK...so I felt I had to keep reading it. It was a good story somehow; but it had some major flaws. You can see the flaws listed here by my fellow reviewers, which are sometimes better written than the book. <BR> If these two authors are so hyped up on their Ivy league background, I suggest their returning to school for advanced studies.	2004-06-26

I really enjoy her new style. I got away from her for a few years because I myself was tired of the typical romance theme. But I couldn't give her up. She was just too good. Now this is way more interesting. The style she has now is just my thing. I really enjoy it. Thats why I feel we've sort of grown together. I was at a place where I could enjoy her romances years ago, and now can continue to enjoy her refreshing new style. Its so much more....confident.<BR>&quot;Wild Orchids&quot; takes an insight into the writers world. The story is about a writer who cannot write after his wife died.<BR>There is a link with a devil story and an alluring younger woman. Oh dear, I do have to confess it was the part about the renovation of an older home that threw me. When I read &quot;The Mulberry Tree&quot; I was in ecstasies. I was so pleased to read about recovering gardens and restoring old houses again---and all the other things that went on were great too. I even enjoyed the Pullitzer Prize sarcasm story.<BR>Devereaux has more humor in this story. I am reminded of the fun and humor of &quot;The Princess.&quot; I really enjoyed that one. This has the same quality humor in it. Really, its quite well written. <BR>I recommend reading this for what it is: a story about two people finding their families with cool backdrops. It is not in her old format and all I can say to that is this to Jude: YOU GO GIRL! GROW, GROW, GROW!!!	2004-05-30

It is over 900 pages long---I only read books that long every 7 years or so! But----let me reassure you, there are NO slow or dull parts. Its almost funny how refreshing each new intrigue in 900 pages can be. <BR>The story reads like a story written nowadays---however, your imagination is left in full force. There are no graphic descriptions, except for parts about the Plague. The sex and violent scenes are left up to you; oh gentle reader. Also, there is no sequel; the story of Ambers birth is never resolved (does it need to be?) and it is only a slice of her life--say about 10 years.<BR>The point is---nah---gosh, this is a good book. Its about England in the time of King Charles and the 17th century. What a horrible time to be alive and be a conservative! It reads like a modern novel also partly because the time period was just as scandalous then as it is now. Barring a plague and a great fire in the city of London. <BR>Look, its good. They made a movie out of it, right? :)	2004-04-11

I have read Patricks &quot;Confessions&quot; and I am fond of him. I noticed the poor ratings here but wanted to read it anyway. Lawhead+Patrick would be pretty good, right?<BR>What an adventure! Its such an excellent story! But its like Lawhead took just bits and aspects of Patricks life and used them to make a story---with nothing about the spiritual side of Patricks experience at all. Puzzling indeed. Patrick was a nobleman, whose grandfather was a &quot;presbyter.&quot; Yes. Patrick was captured and sold into slavery, yes. BUT he became a saint!<BR>He prayed everyday on that lonely mountainside. Prayed and prayed. He escaped from Ireland and performed a &quot;miracle&quot; of sorts providing food for the sailors and he when there was none. THATS not in the book either. Its like Lawhead fleshed out Patricks story, but skipped some of the real parts. What puzzles me and saddens me is that he apparently skipped out Patricks spirituality and touch with God. Patrick seemed such a human; able to admit his faults and failings. Lawhead captures this.<BR>Makes sense that Patrick could have experience with druids. I know about Patrick, but I don't know anything about the Ceili Dei. <BR>You've been warned: there is NO saint to this Patrick. Even if there is a sequel, Lawhead will have to address spirituality and Patricks dealing with God and the church eventually---besides just the prologue and epilogue. Strange.<BR>The story is adventurous and good; but its truly lacking the christianity and heart of Saint Patrick.	2004-03-08

They can't make that world as good as her own, but they try. Coraline gets help from a hilarious cat and a couple of ghosts; its really a cool story.

I felt like Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, being the excellent writers that they are, tried too hard and...sort of cancelled each other out. The whole story is just not very original, especially if you've read their work. <BR>The characters and the jokes were either too obvious, not funny or too \\"typical\\" for me.

Its a story about a woman who just lives her life. Gets married to a military man, has child, gets divorce, gets career. Lives. Goes on and interacts with the same circle of friends for most of her life. I enjoyed the characters, I enjoyed the writers style. I liked the story. I didn't like that there wasn't an overall significance, meaning or plot to the story. I could be wrong! There probably is! I am sorry! But I couldn't fish it out of there. <BR>The main character, Peggy, starts her story in a little &quot;town&quot; in England as a pilot's wife. She and her friends meet a British woman and include her in their circle. Peggy and her friends move back to the States eventually, and remain friends through heartache, divorce and distance. Their children grow up and give them a world of trouble in the 60s. This is mostly a story of a womans life.<BR>Its not boring; I kept waiting for something significant to happen. I kept being optimistic; &quot;perhaps Peggy will find love,&quot; etc. in the end, but...<BR>This story is like her another of her books, the main characters don't have a profound love. They exist because of something other than that---not a romantic love, but love in the family ties, or friendship ties way. Its a different sort of book.	2004-02-03

I was disappointed to see it come out; my husband and I had thought up a similar story during a long road trip---I guess Gaiman got the idea up and printed first!<br />So I found it intriguing to see what another person thought up in terms of &quot;American Gods.&quot; Now, to business.<br />I loved the idea. The story. There are some flaws in the story.<br />I have read a lot of the reviews and they all have good points on the negative aspects of the book.<br />What main character do you know nowadays has a really good personality, or character? Look at the main character of this book. His name is Shadow. Do you expect him to have a lot of personality with a name like that?<br />The Gods---Its such a neat idea that the old gods came to America with their people. And that they are &quot;dying&quot; out. For a similar story, read &quot;Forests of the Heart&quot; by Charles de Lint.<br />There is a lot that this story follows in myth---however, I know only rudimentary Norse mythology, so I think I lost out on a lot of the books finer points. But it was still good.<br />The characters that Shadow interacts with---they are just up and weird and I don't recall what significance a lot of them had in the story. His dead wife, for example. Being ignorant in folklore and mythology, I guess I missed the significance of the gold coin and the dead wife following Shadow around.<br />Oh dear, I could write on this all day.<br />Look, you've seen all the reviews. I have never written this long of a review myself; most stories for me in review are a nice paragraph in length. READ this book. Its AWESOME. Its good, its bad.

Its kind of depressing. Its a story of a womans life through the early part of the 20th century. It has a catchy title, but don't let it mislead you. &quot;The Great Husband Hunt&quot;---is not really about a husband hunt. It talks about how Poppy has to whiten her neck and wear things to keep her ears from sticking out so she can catch a husband. Ummm, thats about it. Its really a sad kind of life story. Yes, shes an aviatrix and an arts dealer. She has two daughters, Sapphire and Emerald. They're jewish, depending on the decade.This Poppy sort of staggers through life, through one relationship after another, seeking nothing rewarding or signifcant out of any thing. Shes never happy. Its sort of like an average womans chronicle of life. However, I read fiction for escapism, because I am an average woman. So I feel like I just read---almost a biography of sorts. Did I mention this is NOT a romance? Another reviewer remarked on that, and I feel I should mention that, considering the title of the book is misleading.<BR>But really, the style and the story are not bad. Just not what you think.	2004-02-03

I would recommend for those of you who are not fresh out of college or high school to look elsewhere for help. This book doesn't help kick start your math, its just a REFRESHER. The reading and writing were a help, but I really feel that I could've done better on the PRAXIS math if I would've had more detailed math help in the book. I needed clear explanations on how problems were solved. These weren't present.<BR>The rest of it was fine---the reading question and answers were a bit biased; but on the whole a great help for those who need a quick reference guide but have no real problem areas. <BR>The PRAXIS math is not a hard test, but it is for someone who is a bit out of practice!

I was craving one of their books; I thought I might reread \\"Thunderhead\\" or get into the terrifying \\"Relic\\" again. But ahah! Someone psychically released into paperback for me just in time to get a fix. This is great---science, blood, history, suspense, etc. Great quality of writing and interest.<BR>Some familiar characters here. The story is: An agressive builder \\"discovers\\" a tomb of 36 people all murdered circa the 1900s. Who did it and why? They were all systematically tortured.<br />Mysterious special agent Pendergast requests the aid of archaeologist Nora, who also includes her reporter friend, Bill.<BR>They start unwrapping clues as the site gets destroyed, the information and mystery deepen. It all started with the Cabinet of Curiousities, that used to be on the site before it burned down. Was that where the victims were lured to their death?<BR>Also, why are there killings similarly going on now that the site has been uncovered? Is it a copycat or has the murderer returned from his \\"grave?\\" Or was he alive the entire time?<BR>I want to keep you guessing---its just too good to miss.<BR>My only complaint is the authors always make the ending/wrap up too complicated. The ending has too many twists and turns and surprises and it got me a little bogged down. Maybe if I read the end twice I'd get it---I dunno. Keep it easy, man! <BR>Its suspenseful enough! And scary too. I can't wait to read the Crow book....	2003-06-14
US	52692817	R21UX901EC1FPW	0060938099	416657694	Enemy Women	Books	4	0	1	N	N	War at its worst, written at its best	I liked this book for the simple reason that the author did not glorify the war at all. She made it as horrible as we know it really had to have been. Especially in the Western theatre, to the women, elderly, children, etc. who tried to stay out of it or were involved innocently and became guilty of circumstance. <BR>I did not care for the story where it is written in sort of a bizarre way; call me old fashioned, but I like to see quotation marks when the characters are talking. This must have been in prose or poetic form---right?<BR>The whole story is sad, too. Not just the war part, but the entire story itself. Call me a romanticist, but I like happy endings.<BR>War, war, war. How hard it must have been back then in Missouri. I didn't even finish the book, got about three quarters through. It brought me down. Maybe someone else could appreciate it for what it does----it does accent all tragedy and humanity. The story is practical and true to life. But I like a little more upbeat. For what it made me feel, obviously its a good book. But for someone else to wallow in.	2003-06-02

Dickens is the thing. Christopher Marlowe has practically his own cult, complete with door to door \\"salesmen.\\"<BR>where people travel by dirgible, and participate in Richard the III like they do with Rocky Horror. Time is all an iffy thing, too. Barely explainable and understandable, especially in this book. Then add Agent Tuesday on top---its a pretty interesting fantasy scenario. Not a grabber, but keeps us going along. <BR>The Jane Eyre part was pretty interesting, and there was a subtle humor to the story. I still would've liked to know, then, if Hades couldn't die with bullets, ...Recommended.	2003-06-02

I didn't know anything about it. I just picked it up because it had stuff about ancient Greeks in it. (I'm a nerd.)<BR>I was impressed. Great writing. Sounds like the author completed this in or right out of college---she has captured academia's true (and I feel, ridiculous) essence. What is college all about? Check it out in here---its not too different anywhere else. I feel Ms. Tartt has captured the true mindset of a group of twenty year olds--and that goes with the whole murder thing---why it didn't really put them off at all. When you were that age, did you really care about anyone or anything else? Really? Of course murder didn't BOTHER them, they were self-absorbed, alcoholic, problem laden college students. Ms. Tartt did a great job on the mind of the murderer, and the aspects a murder does to the environment of that person. We get Bunny killed off in the middle of the book----what the heck are we gonna do for the rest of the book? Well, think about it of course! Reflect, respond, react. What each of these---well, children, go through because of the murder is just as bad as jail. The characters are rich. I loved the fact that we didn't skimp on Bunnys character, just cuz hes dead! :)<BR>I could go on and on with this. Obviously my fellow reviewers could, too. Thats what kind of book it is. It makes ya think and reflect. Now, isn't that what we want? Its pretty unusual to have a book like that written nowadays. My regrets on this novel:<BR>The Bacchanal was central but vague to the story. Lots of loose ends to that and no detail. Disappointing.<BR>Serious editing was needed. I decided to skip parts, but then some I just couldn't because her quality of writing is excellent (so is everyones' in college, esp. senior year) and her rich character involvement. This story is the story of the outsider who never really fit in---or was he just a puppet?<BR>Great references to California---how'd she know its like that when a Californian moves East? :)	2003-05-05

That was the year the biggest thing to hit Big Stone Gap occured---Elizabeth Taylor and her then husband, candidate John Warner visited the town. The story sort of uses that aspect as an &quot;off point&quot; of focus. Its really about Ave Maria, (thats Ah-vay to you) an Eye-talian woman who lives in town--in the town of Big Stone Gap. Her misadventures at the age of 35 are followed through the year; but apparently we don't end there, there are two sequels to this story. This was quite enough for me. It was sweet and quaint. Her friends and family woes were very personal and up front. Quite enjoyable. We know that a small town doesn't mean people have small lives, their dreams are just as big as us citified folk. Perhaps even bigger.<BR>There are people in this town without running water or telephone. They live in scary conditions. There are the feriners; there are the overweighters, the teen pregnancies. There are the smokers. This town has it all! Its a very detailed look at a woman who feels her clock is ticking---and needs to take a look at her life and what she wants to do with it. This book was a different line of interest for me. I usually don't read this bestseller, modern stuff. It kept me entertained, thoughtful and sentimental. Recomended.	2003-05-05

A bankers daughter begins (too late) to notice all is not perfect in her perfect household. Her mother dies. Her governess is let go under mysterious circumstances. And a bawdy new governess moves in to take her friend and her mothers place---and all other things. Her father is discovered dead from arsenic poisoning---and she is accused of murdering him. I was surprised at the end---I felt sure I knew who had killed the girls father----but I'm not good at guessing, I guess.<BR>The characters are pretty well thought out---theres a voyage to South Africa and the terrain is detailed. But the most standout of this book is the main characters illusions that the perfect way of life can go on uninterrupted. She certainly left one snare of serpents for another, too. Very well written and interesting.	2003-04-21

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great intro to Ancient Egypt	I teach preschool age children---for two years I've taught Egypt and read this to them---they LOVE it! The art is bold, so are the characters! Everyone has a right to claim---they built the pyramid. This story invites all sorts of questions from the kids, such as, \\"why is that mans face like that? Why is that man darker than the others? Why are they wearing diapers?\\" :)<BR>Which, thrillingly, invites discussion answers, such as, \\"that man is pulling a huge stone up a ramp. Hes big because its hard work, hes sweaty because its hot in the desert and hes dark from being in the sun all day with hardly any clothes on....etc\\"<BR>\\"See the river in the background? Thats the Nile! Remember, the river that flows upwards?\\"<BR>I also liked the part where they DO mention that you can't fit a piece of paper between each stone block of the pyramid. Another amazing fact that just happens to be in there and contributes to the overall quality. <BR>The story takes a page from each person who might have contributed to the entire construction of a pyramid, from Pharoah down to water carrier. At the end of the book, there are some pictures of what the pyramid and Senwosret the Pharoah looked like. Enjoyable for a variety of childhood ages and levels. The kids really pick up on the theme and are educated at the same time----hey, why aren't there more books like this out there???	2003-03-27

Its a slight mystery...who are the parents of Carmel, who was found under the azalea bush? Is she related to the gypsys camped in the woods?<BR>And who really killed that mean invalid? You won't find out 'til the very end. Ms. Holt keeps you entertained along the way---Carmel has many an adventure and misfortune in her short life. She travels with her &quot;Uncle&quot; to Australia and lives there a while. Then shes back in England and involved in suitors, weddings and tragedy. <BR>I noticed in the publication that Ms. Holt was born in 1906. That would mean this woman wrote this in her 80s. I am very impressed! The quality of the story and the reflection of life in it is well thought out and gives insight into whats important to be happy.	2003-03-11
US	52692817	R2H0DOUVKO0A8K	0312264917	149069300	The Marsh King's Daughter	Books	5	5	5	N	N	True to life but not so	This was a story that seemed to follow the way of life in the Middle Ages; during the reign of King John and Henry. It doesn't give romance or value to life that we have nowadays; anyone whos anyone is at deaths disposal. The story also reminds of womens rights back then; there were none. If you were born out of wedlock, or an adulteress, there was little recourse; esp. for the lower classes. The story strives for realism; but I feel the love story part between Miriel and Nicholas is a wee bit more fantastical than keeping with the rest of the story. Which is fine, right? So its well written. <BR>Miriel has made some tough decisions and they are not always to her profit; however, as a woman---and a bastard runaway, she had little choice and her vision of the world is skewed. Her story is pretty sad. But I can see a sort of pattern of survival. <BR>Its almost the same as Scarlett O'Hara's! <BR>Nicholas' story is not as sad; I half wanted him to live happily with Magdalene. That part was bittersweet. Does Miriel really deserve him? I don't know. But does she deserve to be happy? YES.<br />The story: Miriel is sent to the convent against her wishes. She finds Nicholas, a survivor of Johns treasure train disaster and nurses him back to health. When he leaves the convent, she wants to go to. Is desperate to. He grudgingly allows her to come along and thus their adventure begins; together and seperately then together again throughout the novel. Very graphic in descriptions.	2003-02-27

Sequel to \\"Shield of three Lions,\\" I couldn't wait to read this one. Its a bit different than the last. Less of an adventure and more of a romance. Less talking and more FEELINGS. <BR>Starts off with a one-eyed jew who comes to collect Alix from her precious Wanthwaithe. Enoch has been injured and is away in Scotland. She tries to fight the jew, Bonel but of course has to go with him and once again meet up with King Richard.<BR>Man, this chick gets all the guys is all I'm gonna say!<BR>Everyone is madly in love with her---could it because she, as the main character, is utterly stunning with perfect white teeth?<BR>And her silvery halo of hair----on and on.<BR>This book was harder to pick up compared to the first. Its so into Richard and Alix. Its like, \\"I wonder what Richard is going to do today? When is he gonna get hit with that arrow?\\" etc.<BR>We interact with Queen Eleanor, too. Travel all of France's territories and are not in England much. Its a \\"middle book.\\" Think of it as the \\"Empire Strikes  BAck\\" or the \\"Two Towers.\\"<BR>Compared to hopeful trilogies. I was hoping that the rerelease means that the author was going to put out a third book; but the first printing of this story was in 1986. It seems unlikely.<BR>So BE WARNED of two things when reading this book:<BR>THERE IS NO SEQUEL evident<BR>THE ENDING IS A CLIFF HANGER!!!!!<BR>But its good. And if you want to know the further adventures of Alix, sans Enoch, my recommendation is get it!	2003-02-16

It gives us different peeks at all sorts of medieval goings on: Crusades, Universities, Intrigue, Law, Castles, that dumb romance stuff all the feminists are into with Medieval women and Eleanor, etc.<BR>We don't get to deep into much, but I enjoyed it. The story also is woven around a girl whose family is brutally murdered and has to flee, disguised as a boy.<BR>She meets up with an \\"evil\\" Scotsman on her own quest and they have all sorts adventures together trying to get her land back.<BR>The story instantly grabs you in the beginning. <BR>Yes, the author does try to use period language. I didn't know half of what she said; nor could I remember my latin to translate. But it didn't really bother me to much.<BR>Also, she threw in a Robin Hood and Maid Marian scene. I thought that that was a bit cheesy, but it was well written for her intent.<BR>The author has great insight into Richards person. I loved it.<BR>There are a few surprises.

After reading my fellow reviewers, I find it amusing that they were all disappointed and that I LIKED it. Apparently, they were familiar with the authors writings and were disappointed compared to his other works----I say to that----I've got to read his others! If this was good, can you imagine how well the others are written?<BR>I enjoyed this adventure. I FELT that it was an awesome adventure, with lots of twists and turns. I mean, yeah, there were a lot of loose ends and/or what the heck? but on the most part---its good.<BR>Cait goes on a quest for vengeance and plans to use the Holy Cup for her purposes. Its a long road til the last showdown.<BR>I enjoyed the descriptions of the Holy Lands and the Crusaders in the dungeon. Stuff you don't think about and then appreciate what you hear.<BR>Hey, why'd that guy favor his side? We never found out. I thoroughly enjoyed the vision Cait had when encountering the Mystic Rose at last. Also, I missed something. Who the heck was the white priest or soldier or whatever who spoke to Cait? Its never said but it didn't make the book difficult or hard to get into. There were parts in the 20th century, but considering this was the last of a trilogy that I didn't read the first two of, I skipped that stuff. It has little relevance to ignoramuses. <BR>It seemed the story was a little sped up at the end. We don't seem to dwell on Caits stigmata much, before its battletime and off to Caithness. I would have preferred more interpretation as the Grail Protector, etc.<BR>But I liked it! So if you're looking for a good Grail Quest to read, like to read it from a refreshing womans perspective, want to throw in a couple Vikings or something, this is the book for you!	2003-01-28

The story is fast paced and keeps going well. Things are always happening, so it makes it hard to put down! I'm so tired! :)<BR>Jane reminds of Jane Eyre. The trod upon Jane who falls for the powerful Mr. Rochester. Except hes now Mr. American Kilkenny.<BR>Hes got Irish and Indian blood in him. Hes running the town. <BR>And he finds her intriguing. <BR>She has a painful secret. She doesn't want to share with anyone and this keeps her and Kilkenny apart for most of the story.

It keeps you going and its a sweet romance. Its built up enough to make it believable and sentimental throughout the story.<BR>Jane grows close to several other women in the story as well as Kilkennys people.

Sometimes if you read a series out of sequence, you're lost and disheartened. But this was easy to step into.<BR>Its the story between a half Cherokee war hero and his wife, a red headed writer of Westerns. Seems they were miscommunicating on the death of their child. He shipped off to war and she would never forgive him---or would she?<BR>It seems a theme for Garlock to have an obsessed dude running around through the story. He provides the suspense in the end.<BR>After reading several of her books, I can say that that part and the everpresent some-woman-is-getting-beat-by-her-man is starting to make me uninterested. I don't know how her faithfuls put up with it. Maybe this is teaching her readers that if you're abused and reading romances, its time to leave him.<BR>Or maybe its to educate the readers on how much abuse is out there. Whatever the case, its present in all the stories I've read. <BR>Back to Kathleen and Johnny--well, this romance seems to drag on through the book. Not much happens in the meantime until she gets kidnapped by the obsessed dude.<BR>The highlight was the post-war stuff and the usual period detail prevalent in Garlocks stories. After reading \\"House on a Hill,\\" which was so good, this was a bit of a let down. But go for it anyway!	2003-01-09

I have since read 3-4 others and am in the middle of another. So yeah, her writing totally impressed me. You can see here that the story is about Bootlegging in Missouri in during Prohibition. But the whole package---what you're getting is not so much your typical romance, where the story focuses on one man and one woman, with subtle humorous secondary characters.<BR>In Garlocks stories, so far that I've noted, she intertwines others stories so theres not just one romance/relationship blossoming. Its not all about the main characters! Woohoo!<BR>The details she provides really impressed me. She'd add little descriptions, or talk about the cars, or how to cook on an old stove, or going and getting ice for the freezer---its amazing to have all the period detail, quality writing and a sweet little romance all wrapped up in one. And I like the fact that some of the resolution ends in DEATH----seems another taboo thing for a romance novel---makes it, to me, stand out as more realistic.<BR>I loved it!

I was dying, ha ha, to read Ms. McMillan's book and got tired of waiting for the paperback, so I ordered online, used, from Amazon.[com] I was not disappointed. Her Civil War mystery series is getting more in depth. <BR>This time the story seemed to focus more on Narcissa and less on Judah; it seems like the last book had more of Judah and less Narcissa; which I suppose is as it should be. Poor Brit Wallace isn't mentioned in the attempts to get you to interested in these mysteries (jacket cover, publisher summaries, etc)---however, as the newspaperman from Britain in Richmond, he is just as much a \\"detective\\" as the other two.<BR>I kept going back and forth between Brit and Cameron Archer; which would be the better suitor for Narcissa? Theres plenty of tentative romance to keep us on tenterhooks for a few more books; do we have to wait that long? <BR>The story does have more of the hospital and nursing aspects; we learn about smallpox in the city of Richmond and the possible threat of an outbreak when a contaminated jacket is stolen. <BR>Ms. McMillan kept me guessing but I was grateful that I could actually figure out \\"whodunit\\" before she let us in on it.<BR>Isn't that the goal of every mystery reader? To figure it out before the author lets you in?<BR>Anyways. Very good. She has a way of writing that makes you feel like you're really there. I don't know what it is. Thats why I was a bit out of sorts at the end---I thought it ended abruptly.<BR>Is that another typicality of a mystery series? <BR>Looking forward to buying a used hardback of the next book! :)	2002-11-28

Good.<BR>I always wanted to read one of those holiday books that seem to be popping up more and more each Christmas, so this one just happened to be sitting there and I was in the mood. I was a bit thwarted by the price for such a slim volume. Nature of paperback, nowadays, I guess. Anyways.<BR>The story is about smart-mouthed, college going triplets, their evil dad gone astray and their tough old granny, whos also head of a candy factory. Will they make dad realize what a mistake hes making with his life before its too late? Will Christmas be ruined? They were too late for Thanksgiving.... <BR>Some of the story is silly. The \\"trips\\" go searching for their squeezes, saving their lives on a dangerous snowmobile expedition. Yet, other people are still out driving around in cars in a Christmas Eve snowstorm, the very moment they are out doing James Bond stuff. <BR>Everything goes along perfectly and predictably. I didn't cry, but Ms. Michaels tries her hardest to get you to. I think its because its just too fast paced and not so very indepth to get emotional. Its a good read to pass around the fire at the holidays.	2002-11-24

Scary in more ways than one. Vampire love story. Vampire romance novels. <BR>Think about it. Anyway. The back of the book sort of gave me an impression that this wasn't a vampire book. Silly. So I read it but got a bit into the story before I realized the silly subject.<BR>Its quite a good story, and its interesting. I guess every individual author has to make up their own vampire rules...<BR>I just don't understand the vampire/undead sex romance thing. Then to throw in a werewolf angle, it was too much. I have read this author before, when she writes/wrote normal stuff, and was impressed by her quality. But was shocked about this stuff.<BR>The story is about two cousins in France who fall in love with vampires and werewolves. An archaeolgical expedition goes wrong; a vampire is unearthed and kills people etc. We all fall in love chasing her down. Its pretty believable in scenarios---she keeps true to the storyline, etc. Its just....I just can't get over it.<BR>I read a vampire romance; part of a series of romances. And they have sex. OK. Gotcha. Hope she moves on from here.	2002-11-11

I wish she would've added a small ending explaining why the author chose to go into some subjects and neglect others entirely. Weird. This is supposed to be a love story, but we mostly read about George's passion for his neighbor; or his house. Where is this love story in the body of the text? They apparently like each other, George and Martha...<BR>Some of the story looks like it is taken from their letters. But the author assures us it is all true. There is not much to the story---love or otherwise. Washington doesn't care for much---the Presidency or the way Martha spoils her children. He is stiff because his mom was a hag---another part played up. As for his Revolutionary campaigns or life in the White House, look elsewhere, baby!<BR>I believe I saw somewhere that this was Clarks first book. That explains A LOT. Its a short story. Readable, not boring.<BR>But I still feel like I know very little about George and Martha and their relationship together. But obviously it was written with love and admiration!<BR>Would I recommend it? Sure, why not. Go for it. Don't expect much.	2002-10-29

I love British authors. I love stuffy, scholarly stuff. But my goodness! Boring from page one.<BR>I tried so hard to like this story, especially since they made it into a movie and its got such good reviews here. And the storyline itself is good. Maybe its writing style or something.<BR>But I got about half way and gave up. The story as far as I got was about a loser grad student who may eventually fall in love with this feminist over a bunch of letters he found about his idol. His idol is boring, too. I just couldn't strum up interest in an illicit affair between a married man and a fairy tale writer. So? I didn't care for the characters, \\"historical\\" or otherwise. I guess I'll wait for the movie to come out. I hope its not as 'long' as the book. I just want people to be forewarned that its not what they expect. Its not an easy flowing, cushy romance. Its stilted and long winded and rambling, this story. But try it! You may feel differently.<BR>I'm just sorry I missed out on whatever everybody else seemed to get from this???....	2002-10-23

After constantly \\"talking\\" about these two characters, and having a mystery on our hands, you'd think Ms. Ramsland would go the extra mile and have closure/resolution. What really happened to Wraith and Christian that dark and dreadful night? What about the book in the box? Wasn't anyone gonna get convicted for murdering all those people that followed the psychic lady from Nebraska for weeks, weeks, weeks? <BR>There story is supposed to keep her busy and is supposed to be I guess a little theme or something through the book while she chases orbs and visits cool scary places. THAT part was entertaining. But geez, the haunted ring ... was so TEDIOUS and BORING!!! Who EVER heard of a haunted ring anyway? For heavens sake!<BR>At least she proves to me that mediums still seem to have no credibility. She doesn't pass judgement on the many mediums and other loonies she meets. She just tries to be objective, which she mentions in the beginning. Granted, she never \\"sees\\" these ghosts, but she still either is incredibly nieve or is trying very hard to stick to the story and not give up.<BR>This book is hard to get through. If not for all the ghostly stories at cool haunted places (Gettysburg, Lizzie Bordens house, New Orleans) and the wacky stuff all the mediums say, it would just be so----gosh, I don't know. So not worth my time.<BR>But it does chronicle a womans efforts to see a ghost, to work with equipment to see a ghost, to try to explain orbs ( a bunch of nonsense if you ask me), to visit scary haunted places such as graveyards, battlefields and sights where people were murdered. She interviews mediums and weirdos and ghost hunters. <BR>The most interesting and thrilling was when she supposedly recorded ghostly voices. I don't know what yet to think about that. That was scary! Yay! But I was disappointed overall.<BR>I could tell she is a good writer and is interested in the Occult and New Age stuff. And I hateto give a bad review.<BR>But it sure was hard to stay interested in a menancing ghost that was never menancing and could never be proved to be menacing in real life---because there was no closure, resolution or final discovery in the end. Don't write like you've got a mystery on your hands and not solve it! Geez!	2002-10-17

Its not supposed to be.<BR>Its a fictional story of a woman and the way she survived when her family was brutally murdered by Indians and taken by those same people. She adopted their ways and was married to two Indian men. Its supposed to be written like she is recounting it. Its not going to be a drama, or a rich unfolding tale of sweeping magnitude.

The story was excellent.<BR>Well written. Not a grabber; not engrossing. Not a \\"I am dying to read this right now\\" book. But all the same, its well written, seems like its well researched, well thought out. I agree with my fellow reviewers and say I didn't care for the way the book ended. I see Anna in a different place that would've been more in the context to the story. But the ending does make sense. <BR>The story is about a woman who takes care of the preacher, his family and her whole town during a year of the plague. Man, its terrible. The suffering is brought home, literally. The author doesn't skip on the vivid descriptions. But we want that. I mean, why else would we read this if we didn't want to know what the heck was it like for people during the a plague outbreak?<BR>This story is believable and based on actual events. <BR>Sometimes the character herself gets a little thin on personality, for example, I don't recall ever reading a physical description about her. But...I guess the focus was more about the social atmosphere and how people dealt with their beliefs about God at that time. I was especially impressed by how she could continue to reiterate certain points and overviews; mentioning the title in the context of the story. Not many authors have the quality to do that anymore. QUALITY. Very interesting; indeed, very well thought out book. I hope she'll write another historical novel; I look forward to reading it.	2002-09-11

I don't know what; but I picked up \\"The Thief of Time\\" cautiously. It didn't sound very interesting on the back cover. But its not...too bad.<BR>It starts out entertainingly and amusingly enough. Pratchett holds our interest with the time \\"thing.\\" Hmmm....its hard to describe the complexity/confusion of this book. Its amusing. Its got DEATH, Susan Sto Helit, Igor, a dash of Nanny Ogg and two new characters, Sweeper and Lobsang Ludd/Jeremy. These two are Monks of History. Sweeper is Lobsang's trainer and they travel time in a confusing manner. The world is going to end if they don't get to stop the Glass Clock from ticking in time. So they \\"slice time.\\" The story almost reads like a mystery: who is Time's child? Thats probably the only thing that kept me going: who was it? And to see how the Auditor (more confusion) turned human ended up. Yes, the Auditor battles the Auditors with Susan in the end, an enjoyable messily written scene of battle with chocolates. If this review is confusing, its probably because I still haven't sorted the story out myself! And this is the way YOU will feel afterwards! HOWEVER: the good thing is: There is an excerpt for Pratchett's new story, Night Watch at the end.<BR>Sam Vimes again. I'm not a big Vimes fan, but Prachett seems to slip into the glove of writing Vimes much easier and skillfully than any of the other characters. I enjoyed that wee little review much more than I did the entire \\"Thief of Time.\\" Read it if you have nothing else to read. Read it if your dying for Prachett. Read it if you can't stand waiting for \\"Night Watch.\\"	2002-08-10

I don't know why I'm reviewing, after reading the others. We are all saying the same things, feeling the same things. This is a good read---its a complete, modern copy of the classic Pride and Prejudice. Its almost disappointing for the lack of originality. But it is humorous and well written. I was saddened that she thanked so many people but forgot to thank the women who put her on the market: Jane Austen herself. The story is about Mr Darcy and Lizzy Bennett enacted in a theatrical play for breast cancer that plays one night only. But the characters are played by modern versions of themselves---got it? Lizzy doesn't have quite so many sisters this go around and as you can tell, shes a journalist. I must say this story was all very cleverly thought out for all that it is \\"used\\" material. What would the writer write next? A \\"Wuthering Heights\\" rewrite? Or something entirely original? <BR>But all in all--I was put off by all the reviews here of all the P&P sequels. But I just kept coming across this one. It didn't look bad and I was desperate for a read the other night! And, thank goodness, it wasn't bad at all. Disappointing in its unoriginality, yet refreshing British humor and insight into my fave book and characters. Neat storyline. Interesting how the family can be scandalised in this century...Better written than Brigit Jones, in my opinion.	2002-07-27

In this one, a diet and a nose job. Ahem. She gets left a &quot;charming&quot; farmhouse and a perfect ten acres by her billionaire husband, who dies under mysterious circumstances. This book reads like somebodies dream come true. Like a fantasy played out in printed pages. So fat lady billionaire is welcomed to the small town and on and on (in VA) and gets to solve a mystery of her husbands past. Its pretty interesting. Everything held together well, even if it is....well, its good to me. The ending seemed a little rushed, and some parts aren't pieced together well, but all in all, a good story. Don't expect any romantic stuff to be the focus of the story---its all about the Golden Six and starting your own jelly business. Oh yeah and I thought it was very...interesting how our main character grabbed her &quot;canning&quot; past when she grew up in suburbia but then later Kentucky----all in the middle of the book.

And did they love it. I sang and flipped pages as fast as I could. Over and over. I teach preschool and this was America week. This was pretty much the only book about America their \\"level.\\" It has beautiful \\"impressionistic\\" painitings of all sorts of beautiful and significant places in America that you can talk about. And if you are proud and interested, the kids will be too. We sit on a map rug so the kids are getting familiar with all our landmarks. But this book helps learn the song and gets them familiar with our nation. The last page has a picture of the Statue of Liberty in the harbor, \\"from sea to shining sea.\\" I felt so good to read this to the kids. Please get this to make not only children feel good about where they come from, but also you as well!	2002-03-05

And I went into it knowing this. But after reading about her ancestors and their adventures, who even cares about Peggy? They are so much more interesting! I could care less how the story was pieced together poorly as a bunch of ghosts popping in and mind reading a foul-tempered Peggy. But their stories were great! And that they were told by ghosts....<BR>The characters have so much to them that they are hard to let go of when you finish the book. Theres a lot to this book. After I finished, I went over a couple of the scenes again because they are so good. <BR>This book was written in the fifties, so the art is a bit bizarre, but its really a good book on Rev War in New York.<BR>Pretty good in the history sense, too. I was quite impressed.	2002-03-05

My daughter checked this book out of the library and made me read it to her over and over again. I didn't see the appeal of this book! But she loved it. So for Fire Safety week with my preschoolers, we read this book. They loved it! My god, they made me read it over and over and over again. They followed me around the room and made me read it. I still don't see the appeal. But kids love this book. Each Mrs. is on the proceeding page, they tell the story of a fire in an apartment building. It takes a bit of explaining for 4 yr olds to get the concept of a flaming cake, but they got it. They even counted the candles. The old lady is represented by about 30 candles---thanks to the author for that one!	2002-03-05

This version is the one I grew up with!<BR>Y'know, where RRH and her granny get EATEN! Gasp, swoon! AND its written with the good ol' James Marshall humor. I loved it as an adult. I read it to my 4 yr old preschool class, not knowing it had the \\"surprise\\" ending...tee hee...they were a bit shocked to know that RRH and granny get eaten instead of being locked up in the closet or chased around the room. What will their parents think? The room was dead silent when the wolf gobbled them up, humorously, of course. Nah, I recommend this book for those who want to keep up the tradition in the fairy tale world.

It had magic, faeries and the Green Man in a believable setting. How rare is the line between these topics split between good and cheesy? Well, Mr. de Lint did a very good job of convincing me of the spirit world and all sorts of other neat things, medicine women, shapeshifters and forest spirits, etc. The story takes place in Newford, and the faerieland near it. (I'm not as up on my Irish or Native American folklore as i used to be...what was the whole thing with the sleeping salmon that never woke in the pond?) Its got an art colony and a music store and people talking about magic. (Ooh! Ooh! And an ice storm, too!) Its got people working for charity and a little bit of romance, too. See, its good! This is the second book I've read by Mr. de Lint, I also read &quot;The Little Country&quot; which was pretty good. Doesn't have as much about fairieland as this one. But from the reviews I've read of his other works, I've just read the two best. Or at least the two best that I'm interested in. Will be looking for more on this type of subject. Thanks, Mr. de Lint!

It usually doesn't take me that long to read a book. I keep thinking its because its seperated up into different characters perspectives---or because it is so detailed. As a historian, I am not too familiar with the French Revolution, so I can't tell you how &quot;accurate&quot; it is. I can tell you to, read the authors introduction, in which she states she superimposed our current culture onto the culture of the French people. IE it means she didn't mess around with historical jargon. I didn't mind that at all---especially since she explained that to us in the introduction. Some others find fault with it, I guess. It depends on what you prefer in historical fiction.<BR>Ms. Piercey tells the story of women from several different walks of life, as well as the story from some of the major players in the Revolution. I can tell you that after I finished this book, I went to the bookstore and looked through a general history of the Revolution and was able to identify everyone pictured in it, as well as all the scenarios and events. So---yes, its very detailed. I liked it, it was just hard to get through...<BR>Theres an actress, a chocolatier, Mme. Roland, whom I didn't care for, Nicholas Condorcet, who I did like, Danton and Robespierre. She shared all different walks of life for me, as far as I'm concerned. I appreciate that she took the time and effort to share with us the different aspects of the people, the very real people of the Revolution. She makes them so real.<BR>She is obviously a feminist, too, by her style. But using her feminist background, she was able to explain to us exactly how and why so much of the Revolution depended on THE WOMEN. And NOT the rich, &quot;educated,&quot; women! Pretty good; Just expect to take it slow!!	2001-12-10

Which I appreciate. But it is really addicting. You wonder at odd moments, &quot;whats going to happen next? And to this person?&quot; But feel no urgent pressure to flee to the book and find out. I agree with the person above--the first sentence had me hooked. Something about &quot;Janey Little loved two things most in the world--books and music, and not necessarily in that order.&quot; I figured with a statement like that, I could definetely relate! <BR>The story takes place in western England, tied to the Faerie world and folk music in the modern world. Barrow stones and magic, sheer magic. Its a pretty neat story with an extremely simple solution to everything----music is the tie that binds us.<BR>The story is also your basic good v. evil; the only complaint I can say is there are two &quot;J&quot; characters, I got into the 40s and realized I was reading about 2 different people and had to reread. Not a good one, Mr. de Lint! Bookwriting 101---keep the characters names seperate! Yes, if you haven't picked that up, either, there are two stories intertwined. Sadly, they don't really quite meet up in the end the way one would wish. But on the whole, its a good story relating to Faeireland. I wish I hadn't read it so fast....I want to go back to &quot;The Little Country.&quot;	2001-11-25

Du Maurier really outdid herself. She took the heart of a woman and made it plain. What romantic wouldn't like this story? Pirates, adventure, philosophy and romance....better than those frilly romance books nowadays. Dona went on a quest and fulfilled it. The first chapter is boring---skip it; I put it down for a time because I was unimpressed. But it is really good. I read parts of it to people as they were working (while I joyfully read) and they kept asking, &quot;what happened next?&quot; Every time I would give a little giggle of glee. This is really good. Rebecca and Jamaica Inn are &quot;dark&quot; novels; but this is an exploration into a womans mind. I comprehend and adore Ms. Dumaurier! Another good writer found!	2001-11-14

The first half of the book is a social history of what an English peasants life was like in England from 1590-1642. In HUGE detail. Trust me, hes pretty darn thorough. I can't stand social history. It doesn't &quot;read&quot; well; why not just make a list: Food eaten by Peasant: Brown Bread<br />Size of Peasants house: varies Roofing material: see boring book. I understand this is a popular book. Its great for genealogy as well. But its boring. The author tries to cover so much it ends up jumping all over the place. From very specific in the beginning, to broad and general in the end. We go from English poor, to monarchy, to across the seas in America. We jump around indiscriminately in 40 English counties, and jump from colony to colony in America. Its a social history with zero readability. Great reference, but I'd make heavy use of the index, don't get bogged down in the text. Social history as the written word, what a dumb idea!<BR>PS You may notice there isn't much reference to &quot;vexed and troubled&quot; in this review. There isn't much in the book, either. Its all up to the reader to deduce it on their own. No problem, but as mundane as some points are (a &quot;huswife&quot; is a housewife; she got that title because she worked around the house all day...) you think the author could've reiterated his purpose a coupla times. Its just me, though. Go ahead and read it if you want to! :)	2001-09-12

Its fast paced and interesting. WARNING---its hard to put down. I read reviews about it but made sure I didn't have any idea about the ending---so I was intrigued and curious to the very end. The abridged version keeps you going. If you are incredibly curious and are way into the story, reserve the next 24 hrs or so just for reading the story! A good and happy man is imprisoned wrongly....he spends the next---what 14 years of his life in the cell of a prison for a shallow crime he didn't even commit. (The author doesn't dwell on that point). What happens in prison? Well, Edmond Dantes discovers a story of a hidden treasure and eventually an escape. It takes him years to set up his revenge and come to terms with it. (We don't dwell on the years, either). The author explicitly states that Edmond has God's approval to carry out his plans on his &quot;backstabbers.&quot; The revenge is great---for he only pushes these evil people's deeds in their faces. They choose what to would do with the realization of their numerous crimes. I hope I'm making sense. But don't except a sweeping tale of love, any romance or swordfighting here. This is abridged and its all about REVENGE and righteousness. It reads like a modern screenplay.	2001-08-30

I picked it up this book on a whim. It starts out a bit slow, but picks up steadily. I wish there would've been a pronounciation guide for all the Celtic names---they're always a phonetic challenge. As to the story---I thought it was good. I know my fellow reviewers sound pretty unimpressed, but it was a good mystery. I appreciate that it was solved with the main characters, not so much new character crap in the end, or a weird twist at the end that made it implausible. I appreciate that! As to Fidelma and her fellow christian, Eadulf, well, name me one murder slueth who isn't cold and boring? The main characters always seem to be pretty----typical....with the sidekick just a wee bit more interesting. Well, as for the plot and story, etc. Sister Fidelma stumbles upon a grisly murder. Whodunit? Follow her to the intimidating kingdom in the valley and find out....twists and turns, the suspicions, the contempt, the theology, makes for an entertaining read. I'm almost tempted to read the others in the series. Almost..... Isn't it unusual to have a mystery set in 7th century Ireland?

Was told it was a good &quot;positive book for girls&quot; etc. kind of stuff. Yeah. Its okay. The rhymes just aren't very in-sync. Sorry, but its just okay. Some of the phraseology is not easy for younger children to understand. Since this book apparently is supposed to flow, by rhyme, taking time to explain (why Isabel gave the doctor a cure by giving him his own shot in the butt, for example) each new rhyme on each new page of Isabel's weird adventures makes it unappealing. I haven't been asked to reread this book since I bought it.  PS. James Marshall does a great job illustrating, though! :)	2001-08-18

Tarot. Halloween. Duh. Two favorite things in one, with a &quot;classic&quot; approach. I looked a bit more into this set; everyone all over the Internet has given the Halloween Tarot great reviews. When I saw such things as the Bride of Frankenstein, the Werewolf and a Hearse for the Chariot, I knew I had to have it. If you are interested in Halloween from a &quot;Nightmare before Christmas&quot; point of view, are just learning Tarot and/or prefer a Rider-Waite background, then this deck is for you! The book that comes with it gives a little more details to the cards and a history of Halloween. I was impressed with the History the authors gave us. It sounds like they put some thought into it than just regurgitating stuff outta books. The author and illustrator both love Halloween. I confess I found the cat on every card a bit tedious, but I know I am a bit picky---get it before it goes out of print!	2001-08-18

This book is not only a great read, but orients you to the trip Lewis and Clark made overland out to the Pacific Ocean. High readability; however, pay attention to the title: this is a book about Merriweather Lewis' expedition west. Anyone looking for much on Sacajawea or York will have to look elsewhere, which is fine with me. Lewis deserves his own book. The author loves his subject---with that it is easy to stay with the story. Its not a heavy read at all. If you are even a bit curious and don't want to get in too deep, this book is perfect for you!

A young niece comes to live with her aunt and go to school in 1960's Georgetown; she becomes in tune with the &quot;cold spot&quot; in the living room....etc. Full of ghostly encounters and researching historical/local sources to track down what may have happened to cause the haunting. There is the typical set up of two couples in a haunted house (romance)and a big load of arguments coming from a young student and an anthropology professor. Bascially, HONESTLY quite alot of this book is about the deduction and means of a haunting, from  &quot;psychological&quot; and &quot;anthropological&quot; aspects, among others. Barbara Michaels is having fun arguing with herself on the possibility and plausibility of ghosts. How to explain them? It almost is like shes trying to convince herself, in paperback form, of why she should believe in something that shes profitted from. The fictional SUPERNATURAL! Around this argument, is the backdrop of the 60's and the hippie generation. Its interesting---what a time and place to write; however, I was not part of that era, so I can only get tantalizing snipets from a seemingly first hand account of the scariness of the 60s and 70s. Yikes! But the two young people aren't too bad, just your average, ageless college students. HONESTLY, the book will keep you enthralled and you can skip over the deduction stuff if you wanna; if you already believe in GHOSTS and just wanna have a good time. Its a good one; not her best but not her worst.	2001-08-06

Its quite impressive. The author explains to his probably mostly pagan audience that pagans and christians can live side by side in religious tolerance; after all, we are Americans.  Very good introductory to paganism; however, it should be pointed out that his history is not recognized by true historians, only new agers who've done a lot of regurgitations on each other stemming from Victorian literature.  Modern day wicca was created in thus, the modern day, about the late 1800's. Suffice to say, the true &quot;pagans&quot; those of the medieval countryside, kept up their festivals and celebrations, even superstitions, but were born and baptized Christians.The &quot;pagans&quot; of the medieval countryside were a conservative lot, with christianity taking hold in the cities first....etc. Well, the lot has turned around. You have for conservatives christians in this century, and attempting to change or alter their rigid beliefs is probably an incredibly slow and dangerous process. This book is a starting point for those in consideration of the topic.  That aside, the author has painstakingly set out his argument as to why paganism should make sense and can be acceptable to Christians. He is kind enough to share his philosphies and beliefs with us in an attempt at agreement. I was surprised at how much I related and did agree to his feelings/arguments. I also had a similar divine experience as mentioned in Chapter 3, leading me to believe that the Divine truly is a part of us and that if the Divine is love, that GOD IS LOVE, then a lot of Christians, and perhaps some hardcore pagans should stop and reflect on how they consider their neighbors, enemies and friends. Would love to see more books like this out there; but on the Christian shelf, too. This book should also be listed in religious studies/christian books, not just new age. But that is up to the discretion of the publisher, Llewelyn, who only publishes new age/pagan titles, and the book store that sells this stuff.	2001-08-03

To truly appreciate this book, I suggest becoming familiar with Western Civ, on a first name basis, before reading this. Mr. Cahill doesn't explain who Catullus is to the reader, he just assumes we know. Or Cuculain. Who are both awesome characters by the way.  The good about this book: Excellent readability! Just wonderful, modern overview on early church and Irish history. Makes his topic interesting. Honestly, you don't get around to why the Irish saved western civ until the last quarter of the book---but, who cares!? We are having so much fun reading about stuffy old Augustine, or the marvelous character of Saint Patrick himself, to pay much attention. If you have the wee'ist bit of Irish in you, this will make ya proud to have it. It truly glorifies the Celtic race on that little isle of green.  I also wanted to mention that his quotations, with Irish poetry thrown in, are delicious. Something unexplored by the modern masses, Irish poetry.... Bad thing about this book: Mr. Cahill LOVES to jump around and go on tangents. I didn't mind it in the least in this book. It makes it easy to pick up and put down if you are doing other things. It is a light read, bring it to the beach or the pool. And you will surely become enlightened and proud! Thank goodness they saved as much as they did! :)	2001-08-03

I give this book to my spiritual friends--- and is also a GREAT book to read and reflect on in the BUBBLEBATH! If that sounds sacriligeous, I beg your pardon!

I found many similarities between myself and with the author and her characters in the book and outside: The character is a small business owner in the vast DC-Land area. Looking for any area to settle and profit in, mentioning locations and suggestions was amazing. So was the story, by the way! I could so relate to the main character--Ms Michaels sounds like she put a lot of herself and her feelings and interests in this book.  The story is about a woman who is dumped by her husband. What to do after being the dutiful wife for so many years? And why was she dumped? She explores the meaning of it all, and rather busily are explorations of friendship and respect, love and deliciously descriptive tales of old clothing. My grammar is horrible, but I hope you get the picture. Its good. Its great! I was very impressed.  For those of you exploring similar &quot;quality&quot; Michaels, I suggest Vanish with the Rose, the Wizards Daughter, Buried in the Rain, the Dancing Floor. DO NOT trouble yourself with that new-ish one, the Other Worlds or whatever it is.	2001-07-21

I was introduced to this book in a feminist spirituality class, taught by a methodist (woman) minister. This and its sequel, Weaving the Visions, helped change my spiritual life. It affirmed the feminine face of God for me, and it did help me to know there are others out there seeking the Femininity of God. That we all have our own, bizarre path to the Divine One; be it one sex or another. This book opens up to a world of feminist thought and ritual; how different feminists, scholars and religious leaders experience divinity and come to terms with it. There are Christians, Jews and Pagans here. An excerpt from &quot;The Color Purple&quot; which Christ seems to favor in other publications. Truly a wonderful work of art for women. A feminist must have.	2001-07-21

Geez, I actually used one of the recipes in this book, put in towards the back. I believe its one of the authors favorites....however, I was surprised at how uncooked my chicken came out according to instructions, non-verbatem, &quot;put chicken in 500 degree oven for about 10-12 minutes.&quot; I guess I'm nieve; either that or I figured a little old lady would know how long it took to cook chicken! Thank goodness it wasn't six breasts! Anyways, the rest of the book is pretty hard to get through. There are pockets of good storytelling, but the book wasn't as absorbing as I thought it would be.  The book is a little bit about everything on the life and family of Ms Emily Whatley, a South Carolinian who gives us her families history back to Eve. I guess I was supposed to be transfixed. I kept thinking I could take this book in spurts of different &quot;mood.&quot; Alas, it was not to be so. When you pick up a book with a grimace, donate it to the library or the goodwill instead!  She does mention her garden----but she also mentions alot of other stuff. Its a rambling piece of a little old ladies history of her life; take it or leave it. Its not the most happening thing, but I guess you have to be from Charleston. I have to wonder why this book was published in the first place....I don't understand the appeal....it must be &quot;A Southern Thing.&quot; Whatever.	2001-07-05

The story is hilarious, with the characters as the odious flasher Foster Pig, the typical hypochondriac in the story is &quot;Don Coyote,&quot; and silly squirrel twins. The Cootie family really IS a cootie family! &quot;Fennimore Cootie&quot; (tee hee) to be precise! Ah, and don't forget the Ladies String Quartet, consisting of large lady baboons.....this book is a must for any kid who will sit still long enough to make it through 27 short (whew!) chapters---but if they are dying of curiousity and they are hooked on the characters, you won't be able to put it down!	2001-06-19

You will not be disappointed with the story. Very inventive and action packed. Granted, there isn't much into character exploration and interaction, but I didn't expect this book to be the end-all, be-all. I expected it to entertain me while I commuted back and forth to grad school an hour away. I found myself listening to it on all my errands, too, entranced with the suspenseful tale of the modern day owner of the island, Mallen Hatch and his partnership with a treasure hunter, Needleman and his crew. They make a deal to split the treasure 50/50; etc. With these authors, I wondered what was dreadful about the treasure and which of the &quot;main&quot; characters was going to bite it. I sat in my driveway, with ice cream getting warm in the trunk, after an excuse to listen to the tape made me drive to the grocery store, my 6 year old daughter insisting we listen to the rest of the tale of pirates and buried treasure.

Is it going to be a modern classic? I think Helen Fielding hits womanhood on the head pretty well, even if she did totally and unabashedly rip off &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in so many ways. Bridget Jones, thirtyish and single, obsessed with her weight, going through relationships and employment. What is the appeal of this story?

Upon rereading this book, I again reiterate: sweet tale, surprise ending. A story of an innocent country girl, drawn by circumstance into a world of spiritualism and seances. A world of the corrupt and of the decrepit, which has trouble believing our heroines innocence and honesty. I love stories that point out all the &quot;peculiarities&quot; of the upper crust, their eccentricities and their evils. Help from Jane Austen here, I think. I hate to stuff Ms. Michaels into a stereotype, but this is one of her &quot;bits of fluff&quot;. Not at all insulting, mind you. This is just the sort of tale I enjoy reading at times. The &quot;Wizard's Daughter&quot; is a good &quot;bit of fluff,&quot; and I recommend it most emphatically. Expect to be entertained!	2001-04-24

I don't know what we're really doing until then.... Entertaining story eventually.... this review is a compliment to the story......going off in to nowhere. But I disagree with a previous reviewer---I think our heroine was a strong female for the late '60s.

It was so long and covered, so much of nothing but a little bit of everything. Very sweet tale, with wit and good taste, I'd wager to say in the same vein of writing as Jane Austen. Yet Jane could tell her tale a bit quicker than this, for such a simple tale of English country life in the 1860's it is. Enjoyable and engrossing, the story is told around the doctors daughter, and the events that occur with her fathers remarriage to a rather shallow former governess and schoolteacher. Molly Gibson, the main character, is an upright citizen and honest soul, after her fathers example. Watch for the predictable love triangle between Molly and her new startlingly attractive stepsister, Cynthia. I was tired of the tedious overuse of the phrase, &quot;tete a tete&quot; but intrigued by several characters. Gaskells characters, such as Lady Harriet and the Sisters Browning, are fleshed out and their personalities pursued with familiarity. Don't you know someone just like Hamley of Hamley, today in 2001? Or maybe the new Mrs Gibson reminds of you of one of your friends? This is what you can look forward to: familiarity and the historicity of all sorts of little tidbits; how &quot;the apple of his eye&quot; was considered a vulgar term, for example. Please read if you are coming off of a Jane Austen high and are desperate; but see if you can find an abridged version, if one exists, for it is sorely needed! PS I got this book to read along with the PBS show currently running. The movie doesn't do it justice, but intrigued me enough to literally hunt for this book! Go for it!	2001-04-11

This is a tedious book. At times, I couldn't read it because it was so tediously drawn out. Others, I had to put it down to marvel at the author's insight. Yet, its too long in some parts--did he get a lot of this stuff from his notes in college or what? What was the point in writing this book---besides the obvious?   A commentary and historical outlook on the Bible. How original. The author is so bitingly sarcastic at times, I had to half wonder if it was just as hard to write this little tome as it was to read it. Frankly, when he changes his focus of the book half way through, (whatever it was in the first place, I am not too sure) to ONLY the Bible as a reference, it gets boring. Very boring. Fast. Lets get some outside sources in there, history or otherwise in this part. Yes, Cahill scoffs at and also acknowledges the Gnostic Gospels, but at least use some of them to, just to make it a WEE BIT MORE INTERESTING PLEASE, compare and contrast. Or whatever.  It was just tedious to go over those same familiar passages of the Bible, yeah, just like reading the Bible, and analyze them. Honestly, I can do this at the Sunday sermon at church, or in a class on Christianity. I do not recommend this book for pleasure or curiosity reading. Maybe as a supplement to an introductory religious class for college. His first book was excellent. Hope his next few will turn around and head in the interesting and readable once more. Just looking at this book gives me a headache when I think about trying to finish the last two chapters. HELP!	2001-04-11

Granted, I have not read &quot;Living in the Lap of the Goddess,&quot; Ms. Eller's other book, but I would like to say that despite the finally published &quot;proof&quot; that there is NO truth to the matriarchal stories wiccans and pagans set such great store by, that Goddess worship can go on. A great part of a religion is faith---I think Ms Eller distinguishes this. I have faith that the Goddess does exist---but I am so VERY thankful that she wrote this book.  It helps back up the minority argument that there is NO CASE for all the matriarchal stories that we have fervently fooled ourselves into believing. In college, I fell to the spell of the Goddess; but studying as a historian, her past did not check out! The answers are out there---seek them with the true scholars. I am so very thankful this book is out there for the few of us to accept the truth. But you can still believe there is a feminine face of God---but not that our ancestors worshipped her for thousands of years. That she was broken up and trodden upon. That she prevented war and men were dumb; that women created everything---society, agriculture, law. Whatever. Someone needed to burst the bubble. This book has it all. I especially love reading, here and in other rare sources, how pagans have created a &quot;pagan holocaust&quot; out of the Inquisition and Witch Hunts. How supposed MILLIONS of women suffered for their &quot;powers&quot; and &quot;secret pagan ways.&quot; &quot;Holocaust&quot; is thrown around a little too loosely these days. Lets just keep it to WWII, okay? Please continue on in your quest, Ms. Eller, for seeking the truth. Truth is something which is hard to take sometimes. But it is a good standard to live by. Please make this book part of your feminist reading lists!	2001-03-09

Its---Ok. Yeah, Mr. Hitt is very detailed about his pilgrim's progress, yeah, he doesn't tell us why exactly he is a pilgrim---thats good---but.....I just was not impressed with this book.  It wasn't a life changer. Was this journey a life changer for the author? If you are looking for a read that gives you----something----an insight, a little education, a little relief from boredom....look elsewhere. Its not entirely too clear to me why this book was written in the first place. Its as rambling as the many pilgrim roads his feet trod upon. Read it if you're a relative or a friend, but my advice would be to skip and reexamine Canterbury Tales.....again......	2001-03-09

She can do anything! Deftly interweaves the stories of a Roman elite, Marcus Julianus during the era of Nero, and the warrior priestess, Auriane, of the Germanic tribes. Excellent detail and thought. You are right there with Marcus, traveling down the street to the Forum or turning up your nose to the sights and sounds that greet you on the way to the Colisseum. You struggle with Auriane, as daughter, mother and leader to her people. Aurianes religious dilemmmas---Marcus' ethical dilemmas. Gladiator school. Beltane. Battles. Your blood runs cold at Marcus' wedding---Highly engrossing. This is the second read for me. I read this while driving across country in 1994. Surprised to see its still out, knowing how excellent it is, I got it again and was not disappointed. I close with a plea to Ms Gillespie---when will she write more? The time is NOW! :)	2001-03-04

I went looking for what Barbara Michaels has to offer: I wanted a modern &quot;gothic&quot; romance. I wanted a a creepy old house on a vast old Virginia plantation, dripping with creeper and ivy, with crumbling foundations and spooky attics. Something like an adult Nancy Drew. (I beg your pardon!) Ms Michaels always manages to set the perfect stage; regardless that the story flows excellent, the dialogues are excellent, too excellent. Ok, yeah, she misses the last star because the story wasn't the best---but atmosphere, my dear, is everything! I'll bet is was a joy to write this story and what a joy it was to read it. If you are looking for a book that has a little of everything....suspense, mystery, romance, etc. This is it. Graveyards, archaeology, family secrets....read on! Don't forget to check out her other stuff to! All in the same sort of line. The &quot;feminist&quot; heroine, the Mr. Rochester-type hero, the spooky background...ahhhh, the spooky background....	2001-03-04

I thought &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was good, but this one is even better! All elements are here: heartbreak, jealousy, happiness, romance, death, suspicion.....what lies next for Harry Potter?<br />Who is the mysterious loyal follower of Voldemort at Hogwarts? Is it Professor McGonagall?<br />This was an excellent book; I was on vacation and could barely take my nose out of it.  Very good; just the right amount of magical lore and wizardry for a good summer read into something basic such as good vs. evil. If only adult sci/fi fantasy were as simple! Three cheers for J.K. Rowling; lets get that 5th book out please!	2000-09-26

I don't know how many times she mentioned chocolate, but I have been cramming chocolates into my mouth during and after finishing this delightful book. Oh, I never dreamed how much she could write about chocolate. Not only is creating chocolate an art, but it seems eating it is as well. What a cute little story! Such wonderful descriptions, a light story on the outside but full of meaningfulness in the center. Ms. Harris creates a wonderful dream world, real and imaginary for her characters.<br />Her characters! Such fascinating &quot;insights&quot; into the lives of French villagers!  The best part, I think: Viane vs. the cure---what an imaginative ending; I kept waiting for a &quot;showdown&quot; between indulgence and mad conservatism---but you have to be patient. Ms. Harris writing style reminds me of Judith Merkle Rileys; if she were to right in the present. Such a sweet, indulgent book!	2000-09-26

This book tells you in detail--it even gives you the details of her children and her role in the mormon community during and after the prophets life. I am not a mormon; however, I have mormon history and I find Emma Smith fascinating. She believed her husband and followed him through so much. She never questioned his teachings except for the polygamy issue; how betrayed she must have felt when those women so very close to her were &quot;chosen&quot; to be Joseph's wives and &quot;hid it all behind her back.&quot; I fail to see what is so holy about that, life threatening or not. I see those women as enamoured by Joseph Smith and his position of power, status and celebrity in the Church---&quot;groupies&quot; basically.  It seems Emma has proved she was not impressed so much by his authority, but of her human husband. Capable of much folly and error, yet wholly human. The authors paint Mr. Smith as just such a man.  I feel they have Emma's personality down right. She had an unlucky time with her husbands. For a woman of such wit and intelligence, as this book proves, it is too bad.  The authors show us also how Emma was seen by the Church and its members after Josephs death. I feel the book was not biased, for it seems an effort was made to keep it objective. I appreciate that it was not an attempt to convert me or prove &quot;mormonism&quot; to me at all, either. It was simply a good, researched, interesting book. Truly, Emma Smith was an &quot;enigma.&quot;	2000-09-21
US	52692817	R3ULI6ROEGMTJO	0140432108	866295104	Agnes Grey (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Only Amazon had it!	Thank goodness for Amazon.com. I searched for this book in two different towns and came up negative in every single book store. Why is it that Anne  Bronte is denied the spotlight that should be shared with her sisters  Charlotte and Emily?  This was a very good story, very in tune to the  romanticism of the era. I found Miss Bronte's entries on the punishment and  discipline of children amusing and applicable to todays standards. She has  a very sweet but determined heroine, who sounds like a reflection of  herself. I haven't read her other book yet. But judging by the quality of  this, I recommend both of her works. Cheers to the Bronte sisters!	2000-08-22
US	52692817	R2BCZHDD71S2L5	0812564669	596423105	Household Gods	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Time travelling to exotic destinations	I have to disagree with my fellow reviewers....I enjoyed the novel  immensely. I felt the reason why Nichole was so whiney was because she was  in part her own antagonist. She had to be an extreme feminist whiner so she  could go with the story, develop herself. Granted, I got tired of her too.  But thats what made the story work. Absolutely engrossing, fascinating  details. Yes, the accuracy was on some accounts poor (didn't know there  were female actresses back then) but I felt that I had a taste of what it  might be like to live back then. Mr Turtledove and Ms Tarr give horrendous  detail, so much so it feels as if you have time travelled back yourself. In  fact, with my conservative nature, I am sure I could adapt myself more  readily to the situation than Nicole could. But that is the intended view  of the authors, isn't it? If you would like to know what its like to  experience birth, death, pestilence, war, faminine, slavery and not to  mention a day at the circus, I thoroughly recommend this book. I wish there  were more like it. And I wish there had been less time spent in the 20th  century; I already know what its like to live here, thank you. And also,  regarding how we are left hanging as to the fate of Umma after Nichole  comes back to this world, well, use your imagination!	2000-08-22

Having written my senior thesis on Confederate Nursing, I was surprised to find a fictional story about womens role in Civil War Nursing. History has given us much on the role of Yankee women nurses, but Southern womens  efforts are still to a large part neglected. In jumps Narcissa Powers. A  believable Southern belle; too effeminate and simple at times, you wonder  why she is the heroine and not Jubah?  A most respectable woman. I don't  agree with the war being entirely focused on slavery--the one inconsistency  in the book I found. But her in depth information on hospital conditions  and womens issues is great---I really enjoyed this book. Forget about the  murder and mystery! I had fun enough exploring the characters and the  medical and cultural body surrounding it. I recommend this story for women  enthusiasts of the Civil War. Can't wait for the sequel to come out in  paperback!	2000-07-04

This is a very positive and intriguing book for young women who like to read about ancient history and clever girls. You can read this book over and over again--this was the first and only book I read again right after I  finished it. The first and only after a lifelong love of vociferous  reading! Mara is someone you can relate to; Sheftu is admirable and someone  you would die to have Mara fall into the arms of...if only Sheftu, if only.  Mara's struggle for happiness is something we all wish feverently for her  and ourselves as we take on her character and navigate through the tale.  Good ending, enough to leaving you guessing &quot;whatever happened  to...?&quot; and giving you enough to use your own imagination---something  unheard of in todays world!	2000-07-04

I could not stop reading the story; these two authors write about all the interesting stuff. They had me curious,  terrified and worried.  Their heroines are admirable, strong and  believable. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to seriously escape  the world for a day or two and enter into the Lost City of Gold!	2000-07-04

This is the book I read after every semester in school, after vacation or when I have &quot;Riley withdrawals.&quot; I had to include my review here, because it is so very good. This is my favorite story of all her books;  Genevieve Pasquier is a believable and remarkable heroine--she actually has  weaknesses! Shes &quot;ugly&quot; and is upset about it! She has a mind and  a father that reads philosophy--how unique is that! (Ok, so her mom is  looney and poisons people and her sisters a romantic fool, but hey,  family's always weird!) Then you've got the interwoven story of the witches  and D'Urbec for a great page turning tale! Too bad this isn't a literary  classic; I truly feel it should be!	2000-07-04

We picked this book up to read when my daughter and I were browsing through a bookstore--it looks like it must be one of James Marshalls minor works; but trust me, its good! Its hilarious! (as usual) Watch out for Mr  Raisintoasts' speedboat and the fat lady with a moustache who will  &quot;BOP&quot; you if you don't give her a kiss! Sigh. Hes such a great  author! Thank goodness for James Marshall; even though its not something  that jumps out at you at first, you won't be disappointed!	2000-07-04

I confess I skipped through a lot of the future to focus on the past.  Ms Benson, the love interest for Alejandro killed it;  it got boring with that little interjection. But the medical history and  the witch Sarah were very fascinating. I was pleasantly surprised by how  much I enjoyed this story!	2000-07-04

Thanks Mr. Lund for mentioning them! I find the books to be a bit tedious  in the &quot;cutesy&quot; and wholesomeness; his embodiment of the female  is seriously weak! I as a woman feel my sex is misrepresented with hand  wringing and soulfull eyes, etc. But on the whole, the first three have  been good. Very spiritually motivating and descriptive. It gets hard to  read about all the suffering the early church went through; but it always  turns out good in the end.  The ending is good. It brings to a positive  close the nail biting issues of the first two books. Very curious to see  how the rest will come out! My encouragement to you, Mr Lund!	2000-07-04

Its so personal, but yet you still want to know more. I have been wanting to start planting bad, but this book has sustained me and inspired me. Its  such a wonderful, light book full of goodness and light. It includes  stories on the authors life and family, as well as bits and pieces of world  myth and Irish traditions. An excellent book to pick up for a sunny day! I  wish there were more books like this out there!	2000-03-13

It does lack the greatness of &quot;A Vision of Light&quot; and &quot;Oracle Glass&quot; and her characters are not as well-formed, but all in all a  good tale. The historical bits (Nostradamus, Medici Queen) broke up the  story and made it choppy; but I did enjoy the usual interweaving of  characters and their quirks. Menander wasn't such an evil head so much as a  witty one. Do pick it up when if you get the chance, you won't be sorry!	1999-12-05

Ms. Purkiss refutes such  &quot;popular&quot;&amp; &quot;New Age&quot; researchers, whose  evidence/research are in question. Starhawk, Barbara G. Walker, Barbara  Ehrenreich, among others wrongly paint a portrait of the witch in history.  Ms.Purkiss helped me regain my path of knowledge after being led astray-she  did it so conclusively that I could not regain my composure for days. Thank  goodness there are people like her out there, or women's history in Western  Civilization could get out of hand with lies and media stereotypes.	1999-01-26
