This book is so wonderful.<br />Nevermind the fact that i've been having a blast breaking out the crayons and coloring the beautifully drawn vaginas...<BR>But this book helps to de-mystify and remind women (or men) of the beauty of the female parts.<br />This book contains about 25 drawings of flower-like genitalia.  Each drawing is beutiful and unique - just in the same way that every woman is beautiful in a different way.<br />This book presents women's sexuality is such a matter-of-fact and positive manner.  I wish all women could see this book as a child, again as a teen, and again as an adult -  to remember to always be proud and never be ashamed.	2003-02-15

This book is haunting my thoughts days after i read it.<br />In 138 pages, there's not much room for action to occur - but the characters are developed just enough so you feel like you know them - but just too little that they remain mysterious and can surprise you.<br />It takes place on a college campus - in a woman's dorm - and in a poetry class.  All of the students fall madly in love with the teacher - but the narrator also becomes fascinated and intrigued by his wife.  The couple takes an interest in several of the girls - which excites them at first  but ends up disastrous.<br />This book shows true human nature, which many people like to ignore.  Joyce Carol Oates portrays people as beasts, no different than the ones that the scupltress-wife creates - which disgust and repulse the town as well as the narrator.<br />Most of this book is slow with little action and then the ending is explosive and left me thinking for days.  <br />This little novella is incredible once it has time to sink in!	2003-02-14

I picked up this book for two reasons: first of all, i work in a book store and since it came out, we've been selling tons of copies of the book off the display tables, which always makes me curious to read a book.  And secondly, the author is compared to William S. Burroughs, and to compare any modern author to a great such as Burroughs, makes me skeptical, so i had to see for myself.<br />This book is very well written.  The story is a flashback, so it keeps foreshadowing as to what may happen... but doesn't give away too much until the last few pages.  She keeps hinting at what happened in little bits and pieces, which makes the reader very curious to put together.  This makes the reader want to keep going - and for this reason i read the whole book in 3 or 4 days (while working full time and X-mas in between - so i didn't have much time!)<br />The story, is a little unbelievable though.  It seems a little bit exaggerated that one little girl could have so many adventures in the course of a week.<br />But the author does depict the pettiness of high school well, and the boredom of kids growing up in small cities or suburbs.<br />I'd consider this a good read.  Great to polish off in one weekend and feel accomplished... but then think about for days afterwards.<br />If you enjoy this... try also<BR>Francesca Lia Block's \\"Dangerous Angels\\"<BR>and<BR>Douglas Coupland's \\"All Families Are Psychotic\\".	2002-12-29

I feel like it was maybe 8 years ago or so... i was 17 (i think, by looking at the publication date).  I don't even remember where i got it.  Did i buy it?  A gift?<BR>I just remember loving this book.  It's the story of 2 unlikely people to date... by unlikely, i mean people from different \\"sides of the tracks.\\"  I remember being enthralled by their romance (and by some sexy scenes in which they do some things in a car).<br />Kevin Canty's new book \\"Honeymoon and Other Stories\\" came out not too long ago.  I manage in a book store and didn't even realize that it was the same author, and picked it up when i noticed how many copies i was selling and after selling one to a musician i like.<BR>Then when i went to my mother's house for X-mas, i rediscovered \\"Into the Great Wide Open\\" on my childhood bookshelf and remember loving it.  So not i'm really excited to read \\"Honeymoon\\" and to re-read \\"Into...\\"<br />This is a book you can read and re-read.  I think Kevin Canty definately knows how to tell a story!	2002-12-29

He is dying, and some of the scenes are his dreams/afterlife visions - whichever way you want to look at it.  It flashes back, and you get to see some of Vishnu's life as a young boy & man in order to further understand his situation.<BR>   There are three married couples in the building - each of them with different marital problems, issues with their children, and religious standpoints.  Two of the wives are always bickering, which makes for some comical scenes.<BR>   There is one widower in the building, who we don't learn much about until later, but his story reflects a lot upon the way Indians are married and how some deal with it.<BR>   All of the characters are wonderfully developed, and the narration is done by several of them, so the reader gets a glimpse into each of their thoughts.<br />THE SETTING:<BR>   It is set in an apartment building.  The neighbors are all fighting over whose responsibility it is to care for the dying Vishnu or who needs to remove his body when he dparts.<br />THE RELIGIOUS UNDERTONES:<BR>   Vishnu is a Hindu god, and in his death, the character Vishnu begins to wonder if he himself is a reincarnation of the god.  There are many references to Hindu folklore and mythology in the story - but even if one is unfamiliar with these tales, it is explained well.<BR>   One of the families in the building is Muslim and the rest are Hindu.  One gets a glimpse of the ongoing rivalry and hatred between the two groups on a small scale as well as some of the differences and similarities between the personal lives of the two religions.  The author does a good job of not making the reader prefer either of the two religions, especially by plotting for the son and daughter of the two families to maybe elope - and Romeo and Juliet type plot.<br />INDIAN CULTURE:<BR>   Indian culture and flavor can be sensed from this novel - even for one who is unfamiliar.  The foods, the cafes, the movies, the churches, the city, etc. are all touched upon.  And bless the author for putting a comprehensive GLOSSARY at the back, for all of the Indian terms that he uses.  It makes it informative and a pleasure to read.<br />OVERALL:<BR>   This book was very enjoyable for both it's cultural knowledge as well as the family aspects that everyone can appreciate (well, everyone that HAS a family!)	2002-12-10

I can't help but be faced by a major dilemma when considering the purchase of this book.  As a die-hard fan of Nirvana (i was in high school in their prime and i can recall exactly where i was at the moment of Kurt's death)... i am remarkably CURIOUS to read the words of this beautiful man.  But at the same time... GUILT eats at me when i think about buying it.  I feel like i am handing over money for someone's soul.<br />The book is BEAUTIFULLY made.  The dust jacket/cover is designed by Chip Kidd (author of the Cheese Monkeys and desginer of many-a-cool dust jackets).  The jacket is a glossy, glossy black with just the simple words \\"Kurt Cobain, Journals\\" in red and pink.  And then underneath the jacket, it looks just like a \\"Mead\\" notebook - the front red, and the back the manilla color of a notebook.  <BR>The inside is high quality color reproductions of the pages - whole - with the spirals visible.<BR>Most of the pages are not dated, either by Cobain himself or by the editor.<BR>The book is rather large - think coffee table book - not actual notebook or a book you'd carry around and read page by page on the subway.<br />All in all - the display at the book store looked like an arrangement of funeral notices - and there were many people browsing... but i didn't see anybody buying.<BR>I am curious and i'd love to own a piece of K.C. - but it just doesn't seem right to BUY a piece of his soul in this manner...  Thanks, but No Thanks.  Rest in Peace.	2002-11-05

I've read ALL of Palahniuk's books (except for Fight Club, but i feel i don't have to because the film was such an awesome adaptation)... and this one definately ranks with the others.<br />The story is about a male reporter and a female real estate agent that accidently (and at a sad cost) find out about an ancient culling song, that when sung to someone, will take their life.<BR>One of the two uses the song for power and money.  And the other is just trying to fight himself and his desire to use it.<BR>The two, along with a younger couple) decide to go on a road trip to find every existing copy of the book and destroy it as well as to find the master copy - which must have other spells in it.  One of them intends to destroy it to save the world... and one plans to use it to take over the world.... if only it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.<br />This book, like all of his others, is a biting satire on human kind... and even more specifically, on Americans.  You definately need to be able to laugh at yourself to enjoy his books.<br />I would definately recommend this book... and Choke and Survivor as well... Invisible Monsters is his weakest work (in my opinion) and should be read last by the die-hard fan!	2002-11-03

And of course... the stories mingle as the characters begin mingling outside theor social circles.<BR>The way i'd say this book was different than some of her others (and i've read about 10), is that it's more... well... more like a soap opera.

He talks about \\"Natural\\" vs \\"Artificial\\" flavors, which was something i never paid much attention to... and now know to avoid!  He talks about the meat packing  plants... which was kind of gruesome....  but being a vegetarian, it didn't affect me much.  Then he tosses out some surprises... McDonald's fries are flavored with beef!  Watch Out Veggies!   This middle section was the most interesting part of the book.<br />And the third part is how fast food has affected the whole world.

I knew that the film (Starring Angelina Jolie and Jenny Shimizu... yum!) version was based LOOSELY on this book - but i didn't realize HOW loosely!  The book is 1,000,000 times better than the movie.  The characters are more real (not 5 very attractive girls being a little &quot;naughty&quot;), the acts of rebellion more extreme, the setting (small blue collar town in New York State, 1950's) more appropriate... and it's just all more compelling.  The novel really helps you get into the mindset of the sisterhood of the gang - and is more racey.  Everything was toned down for the film, and loses a lot of the intensity.<br />Even if you didn't like the film - you should check out this book.  It exhibits some female rebellion in a time/place where women could hardly expect the respect that FOXFIRE demands.	2002-05-13

It's about the daughter of a legendary artist - she just turned 30, and is still trying to find her place in the world.  The story is told through all of her break-ups with the men she thought woul each be \\"the one.\\"<br />If you just survived a break-up, you may find some consolation in this book... there's no way any real person is as pathetic as this character.  Or if you ENJOY hearing your best friend whine about her break-ups, you may like this.<br />But if you don't feel like hearing a yuppy complain about how life is so unfair, you might want to steer clear of this book.<br />The one redeeming factor is the language of this book.  A lot of slang is used (which could be good or bad)... but MoonUnit uses a very casual tone, and very frank language - which makes the narrator seem more like a close friend than an imaginary character.<br />All in all, i found this book very ordinary.  Had it not been written by a daughter of an already-famous person,  i seriously doubt its publication.  It was an entertaining read, but definately not worth the 3 days of my time that it tok to read it.	2002-05-06

The main characters naivete becomes our own foolishness.<br />The language of this book, like all of Palahniuk's, reads like a music video - very fast paced, uptempo, and vivid.  I read this book in only a few days; it was very hard to put down each time.<br />This book was excellent and humorous, just like &quot;Choke,&quot; but also like &quot;Choke,&quot; could become offensive for religion fanatics and/or people with no sense of humor.	2002-05-05

The second in the Mrs. Murphy series... \\"Rest in Pieces\\" is equally as cute as the first one, \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"  The plot is very simple, the ending predictable... but fun nonetheless.<BR>The relationships between the animals (and this book includes more than just the cat and the dog... but a possum, 2 horses, a snake, and an owl as well) is fun and cute to read.  And the relationships between the characters are developing well... the reader is introduced to everyone in the first book... and reading the second one is like being re-united with old friends.  And i am looking forward to the third one to see if the budding romance from this novel continues.<br />Whereas i'd hardly call this book quality literature... it was a lot of fun for a rainy saturday afternoon... and for [money] is a lot better than most of the movies in theaters now!  It's a great read for animal/mystery lovers.	2002-04-21

Whereas this novel is different in concept and theme than Neil Gaiman's past (Neverwhere &amp; Stardust), it is equally as magaical and transporting.<br />It tells the story of a man, Shadow, that was just released from prison.  He meets Wednesday, who offers him employment - which seems like a streak of good luck... or is it?  Shadow is sent on a series of adventures all over America... risks danger, meets ghosts, and of course... gods.<br />Like all of Gaiman's novels, this is a fantasy novel with language so rich, you can step into the story.  But unlike the others, this is the first one to take place in America (Gaiman himself is British), which makes it kind of fun for American readers.<br />In story form, he reminds readers what happens when people start forgetting the past and their heritage and allow for technology to take over.  With personified gods and an outrageous, yet incredible story... this book gets the point across delicately.<br />&quot;Neverwhere&quot; was the first Gaiman book i ever read... and still remains my favortite.  It was so enthralling, i couldn't even put it down.<br />&quot;Stardust&quot; was the second i read... and was a fairy tale told for adults... which was uplifting and beautiful.<br />But &quot;American Gods,&quot; is like a whole new sophistication for Gaiman.... i was shocked at the intensity and complexity... but pleasantly surprised... and i can't wait for more.	2002-02-19

A friend bought me this book... it was her favortite book in college.  (I think she read it in Germman, though).  <BR>It tells the story of a man that bears no scent... but has the most incredible sense of smell in all the world.  He goes from a rodent of Paris society, to a town curiosity, to a hero of sorts.<BR>The language of the book is so intense, you can almost imagine the smells, then curse yourself for not having the characters same gift for storing scents in his brain.<BR>This book was easy to read, in the way that the story was compelling and the language so wonderful, that it just left you wanting more.	2002-02-19

Bender writes a group of seemingly unrelated scenarios.  Each one takes place within a couple of hours or a day or two... and each one encompasses an average of 10-15 pages - making for a light, entertaing read.<br />A few of the stories stand out in my mind... but the rest just blend together.<BR>--- One story tells about a rich girl in a fancy dress that follows a man home... blah blah... it kind of dragged on.<BR>--- One story tells of a woman's lover who biologically regresses to a single celled organism - symbolic i guess, but kind of weird.<BR>--- A story about a woman who recieves a mysterious gift in the mail (a bowl), lacks explanation.<BR>--- One story tells about the strange occurance with a woman giving birth... just weird.<BR>--- The librarian story... was GREAT and funny.  It made me smile.<BR>--- The Fugue tells several different tales in one, but then they all seem to connect in an incredible way - this was my favorite... very profound and beautiful.<br />All in all, most of these stories were just average... but a few stood out to make it an OK read.<BR>Some short story books i prefer:<BR>   \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" by Neil Gaiman.<BR>   \\"Complete Poems & Short Stories\\" by Dorothy Parker.<BR>   \\"The New F*&@ You\\" edited by Eileen Myles.<BR>   \\"Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy\\" by Tim Burton.<br />Check out \\"Girl in Flammable Skirt\\" ... but those i recommended above as well!	2002-02-19

For whatever reason, this is the only Kerouac book i've read so far (people tend to read On the Road first, or maybe Dharma Bums).  I liked it a lot, it is a very sweet story about the relationship of two teenagers. But being a female teenager when i read it (i'm 22 now), it was a little hard for me to relate. I think a teenage boy would enjoy this a lot more than I did. There was a lot of good dialog... and parts of the plot (sports, friends, family)other than the relationship that were enjoyable too.<br />Overall, I would consider this a good read.	2002-02-10

This book is informative and well-written (it's not boring like a biology book, but also not dirty like pornography). It talks about safety and basic how-to's on the subject, but also talks about why you'd even WANT to attempt this. After nagging my girlfriend about this for months, it was after i gave her this book that she finally gave in. This book gave us both ideas and helped us find more options. <BR>There are FAQ's and little anecdotes.<BR>I recommed this book if it's an idea you've already have and just need info... or if you find it a shocking activity, and just are a curious person!<br />(It makes a great gift!)	2002-02-10

Neil Gaiman rocks my world... so i tried to read Fellowship of the Rings.  Whereas, i will say that the language is beautiful, and the characters are charming, and the plot interesting... it can be considered long-winded.  This book is fun, but don't expect it to be light reading to whiz through.  They spend 80 pages walking down the same road - it's almost as though the book is written in real time.  I wanted to say, &quot;Frodo... Are we there yet?&quot;<br />I do recommend this book... it is wonderful... but only if you have the time and patience to get through it.	2002-02-08

This is the story of a woman that travels into the future... and is dismissed as crazy because of her race, poverty, and her claims of a feminist, hopeful, future.<br />I had to read this book for a college sex & gender class a few years ago... and out of all the feminist literature that i was required to read, this was my favorite.<br />It's an entertaining story... but it harbors important messages.  It's like a \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"1984\\" for the educated woman.	2002-02-08

(Yeah, yeah, i know... you can't judge a book by its cover - but being the perfect consumer that i am, something as beautiful and ineteresting as this caught my eye.)<BR>The book tells the story of a boy going to his state college to major in &quot;art.&quot;  Eccentric art skool friends, nutty professors, and the pretentions that come in the field, are accurately portrayed.  Because I graduated art skool a year ago, i find this book particularly amusing.

This book is a fantastic journey through a land called Faerie... with several characters all in search of different matters of the heart.  Neil Gaiman has a wonderful way of creating fairy tales for adults with the same naivete as children's tales, but with an incredible maturity.

I am not a teenager (college grad), but i love her books for a step away from reality.  She deals with modern issues (homosexuality, tattoos, popular music, rape, sex, etc.), but adds details like fairies and magic to keep it light-hearted and wonderful.<br />This book was sweet and entertaining... but by far not her best novel.  I'd recommend Violet &amp; Claire (a story about 2 best friends), Nymph (her book of adult erotica short stories) or Girl Goddess #9 (a young adult book of short stories.)	2001-04-12

This is the story of a budding romance between two seventeen year old girls - about their insecurities with their homosexuality and their insecurities with love in general.  This book rates as &quot;children's&quot;, but i found it to be written on a very mature level (i am 20-somthing, definately not a child).  It is one of those wonderfully happy-sad stories that makes you remember your own lovers and the issues that tried to keep you apart, but drove you even closer together.  This book is well written and an over-all beautiful love story.  I highly recommend this book to young women, and experienced women as well.	2001-04-01

Rita Mae Brown's dialogue and plot is interesting from the very first page.  The book tells the story of a lower-class girl growing up, her learning about sex and dealing with her own homosexuality, leaving home and starting a life of her own, college, city life, dating, etc.   The reader identifies with Molly through all of her hardships and celebrates with her through her joyous relationships.  This book deals with lesbianism in a very realistic manner, but at the same time could appeal to heterosexual women and men of all types.  It is a coming of age story that is simplistic, yet incredibly ... can i say perfect.  It's a very short book, and easy weekend read for pure enjoyment.  I'd highly recommend this book - to anyone.	2001-03-20

As a feminist, lesbian, and avid reader/student of women's studies, i have to say that this is the best book i've read all year.  Inga Muscio talks about female anatomy, rape, abortion, orgasms, menstruation, and prostitution.  While i didn't agree with EVERY point she made, i was shown an itelligent point of view that made me think of things i had never thought of before.  She made me feel even PROUDER to be a woman.  I have purchased copies of this book for my girlfriend and another female friend, and i intend on buying a copy for my mother.  I wish i could give this books to everyone that has ever meant anything to me, male and female, to share her  beautiful points of view.  She embraces life, praises women, and entertains all at the same time.  I recommend this book to everyone for an education and a new appreciation for women and for life.  I recommend this book HIGHLY, and you'll want 3 copies (one for yourself, one for your best friend, and one for your mother/sister!)  ENJOY!	2001-03-14
