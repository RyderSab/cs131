The young daughter of Doc Horror gets herself into a lot of trouble in this one but she either gets by with a little help from her friends, or figures a way to get herself out of trouble. A little cutesy in places but still a worth while read. I do recommend you get this with one or two of the other books in the Nocturnals series as it will make some references easier to puzzle out. This is one of three books I bought because I was interested in having a look at the Nocturnals series as a whole to go along with the genre book for the Mutants and Masterminds game published by Green Ronin. I have rather eccentric tastes but the whole of the Nocturnal series stands alone in my mind as some of the most ghoulish fun I've had reading comics.	2005-07-28

The series intrigued me, B Movie Horror with elements of Lovecraft and Film  Noir? These are not really what you would call \\"Super Heroes\\" Doc Horror and crew have more in common with the Punisher than Captain America. They are however a motley crew of monsters that live in a nocturnal world in which Halloween never truly ends. It is a dark world and while the Nocturnals fight and bleed for humanity they ask for no recognition and must shun the sun. For those that enjoy dark heroes this one is worth picking up.	2005-07-28

These monsters and there adventures were initially purchased by me to go along with a genre book for Green Ronin's Mutants and Masterminds game. And as with Black Planet, I was not disappointed. Much of the story in this has shades of Lovecraft. Weird places and weird adventures, but if you've Black Planet you know what to expect. The Nocturnals is a wonderfully weird and wacky world to get into. If you are looking for cheery heroes that bask in the glory of their great accomplishments, look elsewhere. But if you like dark and gritty supers who are never thanked for what they do but still do what they to combat evil than the Nocturnals is deffinately worth picking up.	2005-07-28
US	47766723	R24HFUEXV67LQM	1883847036	327599714	Xanadu: Thief of hearts	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Swashbuckling Fantasy of the Furry Kind	One of the best graphic novels I have ever picked up. Now I am a devoted furry fan and fantasy gamer so I may a little prejudiced but I picked this up some time ago and it has never ceased to satsify me whenever I go back into reading its pages. The rigid class system that existed before the book opens up is on the verge of changing thanks to the young, inexperienced and oh, so lovely Empress Alicia. Her tastes in lovers apalls her chief advisor, the dragon wizard Octavious but as the daring thief Tabbe Le Fauve steals into the palace he inadvertantly leaves his heart behind, enraging the corrupt gryphon Sir Reginald Plume and setting in motions events that are as entertaining to watch unfold as any of the swashbuckler films of old. Hard to find but a treasure to read, if you can find this book anywhere, acquire it for yourself. You will not be disappointed by this gem of a graphic novel. Tasteful nudity and erotic subjects are contained within so if that ofends you it may not be as good of a read but even then if you can overlook certain bits like that you are certainly in for a treat none the less. For those that have the maturity to appreciate it, this is one book that you will read over and over again.	2005-05-11

Granted I play Wood Elves for their favored class of ranger but still, I rather liked a lot of this book. Many new arrows and a new treatment of bows I fully intend to expand beyond the elves. In fact tweak a lot of things in here and they can be useful to anyone. The swords are mostly refitted weapons from previous editions. More racial substitutions given provide new options for those that want to play up stereotypes even more than previous. I was also entirely less than enthused with the raptorans but then again, I rarely see the need for avian races in any capacity and this did not change my mind. Although I will say that while reading it I became very tempted to make up a gnoll character, something I have never been inspired to do.	2005-03-19

This is the suggested focal point of most adventures in Eberron. And what a focal point! This place is really well imagined from depths to the heights. Plenty to see and do in this place. Although parts of this is not for the kiddies so becareful of this. Brothels are mentioned, frequently, not to suggest this be the main focus of your stay here but those that have an itch to scratch have their choices. Although this is usually quickly mentioned and then the book moves along. At least one D20 modern critter is featured in the roach thrall although they shoved this buggy in the somewhat limited monster section. Sharn is apparently built on an area of Khorvaire that enhances levitation and flight magic so the sky is the limit is more ways than one. A history is given and a good sketch on how things are done is detailed as well. Beyond Eberron you'd have to figure out how make certain things work for it to be useful, but for the first actual supplement for the new setting of Eberron, this book is very good.	2004-12-18

This book has a lot of goodies for DMs although a lot of what is in here is very, very powerful the price for this power can be quite steep. Designed to slipped rather seamlessly into virtually any campaign this little tool box is a treasure trove of toys that can be used for great effect by any DM for a good old fashioned scare or used as \\"Things Man was not Meant to Know\\"	2004-11-11

Like Draconomicon, Libris Mortis is a tool kit. Most of the material is geared towards DMs but there are toys for players as well. Some more prestige classes and feats of course but most of the prestige classes are geared toward NPCs than players. Although there are some good toys for undead hunters as well. Much more new monsters in here but very well done. The small section on undead PCs bears mentioning as it was well done and if a DM wants to allow it, the idea is intrigueing, not something I would want to pursue myself but the option is there. All in all a great book.	2004-10-15

The feats, magic and monsters within are all geared towards this end. If you want to turn your caapaign into a winter wonderland, this is the book for you. If you want to run a medieval Ice Age, this is your book. For those that like it cold, this is your book. A word of caution on classes, the wilderness classes will get a lot more out of this than the others especially Druids and Rangers. Frostburn stands out in that hands down, Rangers get more new spells than Paladins but at least in my opinion, this is how it should be.	2004-09-24

So far this is the best so far. A word of caution, Steampunk is their most ambitious project yet. From Background Points to Traits, races to classes, the book follows the genre step by step. Do you want to walk into a world like Sherlock Holmes would have found familiar? Or wander through the pages of a Charles Dickens novel as a character he might have forgotten to mention? Would you like to experience first hand the reality of LXG? Well, look no further than this book. Mongoose took elements of the classics (Wells, Verne, Doyle among the more marquee names) and combined elements of their tales into a narrative alternative reality of what could have been. Many of us know and love the setting and elements can easily be borrowed for other games but it stands on its own as well. It was well worth the wait and well worth the price I paid for and I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the genre of Steampunk or is merely curious about it. This book well worth the price.	2004-07-30

I'd seen articles for this in Dragons and though it looked interesting enough but passed on it in the past. The closest I came to purchasing it in the past was the Alternity version which I'll be getting from here soon I hope. Now that I bought this version and I'm suddenly inspired and my mind is running up new ideas. OK, maybe the community rules are better served in the Game Master's Guide but I like having this now instead of later. I just wish there could have been a longer filmography. The Moreau idea I rather like and may make a campaign out of it. Maybe this book is more those like me without all the emotional baggage from previous editions but I love this game. Not a lot of mutations and the sentient plant idea might have been a good idea to include but I'm waiting for the second book in the series to make any real judgements. Again I like what I see so far and recommend it to anyone.	2003-11-29

Finally a book of goodies for those of us who prefer to play true heroes. Book of Exalted Deeds has to be the deffinative book for play Good aligned charactes in D&D/D20. I don't mean just Paladins and certain Clerics, there is something for all D&D style players who want to traverse the moral high road. Their term for truly Good characters is a little pretencious calling them Exalted, but for who choose the \\"straight and narrow path\\" as they put it, there are rewards a plenty. New feats, prestige classes, magic and monsters are found here as well as discussions on how to play a Good Guy/Girl. Robin Hood on par with King Arthur in Exalted status? According to this they both can be. The straight and narrow path is a little broader than one might imagine but while in some cases there is a lot of breathing room for the forces of Light there are perils. This book has a warning label for mature content and in some cases themes that truly require a bit of maturity from the reader. It is also meant to be used in conjunction with the Book of Vile Darkness. Having purchased both books I must heartily concur with this. Book of Exalted Deeds and Book of Vile Darkness are two extremes of the D&D world. Even if you don't use the defaul setting of Greyhawk these two books are meant to be used in the same campaign as a way of differentiating between the Dark and the Light and in this they do their job quite well. Some of the material is drawn from real world faiths which some may find disturbing. But this is also a distinction of the maturity this and its companion volume not just simply require but demand of its reader. Challenge yourself; challenge your world and get this book. And if you don't have Book of Vile Darkness, get that too.	2003-10-28
US	47766723	R17PEBAX2SMQ4	0786932813	338074125	Miniatures Handbook (Dungeons & Dragons Supplement)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Big battles for small tables	I must say that this new idea from Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast is a little better than their last offering. This book is really meant to be used hand in hand with the new miniatures with its skirmish rules. But it also shines on its own merits as a supplement for regular D&amp;D. The first four chapters are the most versatile as they will lend themselves readily to the mainstay of the RPG with new core classes, new spells, new monsters and new magic items. Some of the ideas in rules will seem confusing to some but it is worth the read through none-the-less. I have some problems with some of the material as presented but on the whole this is a very solid effort worhty of notice and possible use in a given campaign. The current set of miniatures are also worth the time to collect and use with this book as they help some of the more visually challenged of gamers understand certain situations a given GM can devise. And they have pics of minis and the guiding illustrations for the sculptors throughout the book so you get a preview of what's coming out in the near future as well as what is already out there. I think they've finally gotten the message and given us a versatile system miniatures that can be used as a light skirmish game or as characters in a given campaign. It doesn't deserve a full five stars but it does deserve four as this is a deffinative work and one that will an interesting generator of ideas.	2003-10-28

While not entirely complacent with 3.5 (none of FFG's products are so this is of little surprise)conversion is quite simple for anyone with half brain in their noggin. The aberrations and oozes in the book need no conversion but the shapechangers do due t the fact shapechanger is now a quality of other categories of monsers rather than a category unto itself. I can easily recategorize all the shapechangers in this volume as either magical beasts or monstrous humanoids (lycanthropes as a general rule become humanoids but this is the exception that proves the rule). Most of the monster described in this tome are ghastly beasts that will expand the mind of the DM using them as well as the players facing them. Generic enough to plop into any campaign with a little or perhaps no effort on the part of the enterprising GM, Twisted Lore is wicked fun for all gamers.	2003-10-20

The book has three main sections which bear mentioning. First up is the critter book. No matter what kind of game you play critters are absolutely essential. There's something for virtually everyone in the first section. Alternity fans rejoice! You will old friends and foes in here as the Fraal return and are expanded slightly to make them available to UFO conspiracy enthusiasts as the enigmatic Greys. Weren are back as sasquatch with an interesting explanation on why their here. The weird winged humanoids have also returned to meet and in some cases become PCs. Next is a bunch of cardboard cut-outs for a given GM to play with in stock NPCs and they even gave some sample teams to possible use. Finally there is a faction book with real and made up organizations. Among the intriguing new comers are an extreme terrorist organization loosely based on Al-Qaeda and a bunch of would be world conquerors (Cooobraaaa! Whoops, wrong game ;)) as well as the American agencies CIA and FBI. Anyone interested in more adversaries and possible allies of any d20 Modern type campaign would be well served by this book. There are suggestions for some of the groups in the suggested campaigns or if you want to design your own campaign, this gives some more options, something that is always warranted.	2003-09-24

Whereas Arsenal came out before d20 Modern, Factory has suggestions on integrating itself with d20 Modern to make a more complete settings as well as give even more options for say an Urban Arcana game. If you combine Arsenal and Factory you essentially have Shadowrun d20 and that's not a bad thing. Factory gives us examples of robots as well as some idea of making your own. Technomagic is the buzz word with this book even moreso than its elder brother Arsenal. Computers get a similar treatment with dizzying ideas on hacking. Enchanted cyberware is also included with a tongue-twisting name but some good ideas here. Quite similar in some respects to Dragonstar's spellware but this is more convergent evolution I'm sure. All in all there is a lot here to like and play with. Good ideas and their integration with d20 Modern is a plus which gives adequate cause to recommend this book quite highly.	2003-09-24

Now that I have it, I can see my expectations were rather justified as Urban Arcana looks like a kind of amalagamation of dark modern ideas like the X-Files and mixes it with a bit of Harry Potter's world. Freaky in some respects but intriguing none the less. Most of the standard D&amp;D races are availble for play as well some non-standard races. I'm getting some other stuff to play with this and I may just try to do a kind of D20 Shadowrun when all is said and done, the possibilties are endless.	2003-09-24

In someways this is SpellJammer advanced in timeframe to the era of Star Wars or Star Trek. The people at Fantasy Flight Games continue to push for their Thug NPC class, which could just as well be served by the generic Warrior NPC class but I digress. The ranger has been altered from a mellee to a missile specialist and fighting with two guns has been relegated to a seperate feat away from two weapon fighting. Wizards now have the option of trading in their spellbooks for a datapad. New stuff is in abundance in this book and in this settings. New skills, new classes, new races and new feats, including one that for many classes is a freebie feat that serves as a gateway into the new toys away from the traditional sword and sorcery fare. Fans of Brent Spiner's role in the ST series he starred in with Levar Burton, Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Merina Sertis and Michael Dorn, will be pleased to note the offering of a new type of construct, the SoulMech which in many ways is science fantasy version of the android. The two new core classes are the Pilot and Mechanist both of which are pumped up Experts but offer a unique flavor to the game and to any party that includes them. All in all a wonderful setting that offers a real alternative to the tried and true formula of the D20 genre. If you prefer the future to the past and don't mind a bit of whimsy Dragonstar is a good setting to explore however a word of caution: Much of the setting is designed as a dark and scary place so if you are turned off by that sort of thing you can still work with it, although alterations may be necessary.	2002-12-27

In any game being the GM/DM/Referee is like being the Wizard of Oz before Dorothy came to visit. The Galaxy Guide is for the Game Master running a Dragonstar campaign. Like any good storyteller you need to know the history and working knowledge of what lurks beneath surface and behind closed doors of a given setting to give it true life. Described within is the history of the setting, major players for good or for ill as well as some mechanics necessary for the genre that traditional sword and sorcery never need worry its pretty little head about. There are also toys to dole out to the players in the form of spellware (the Dragonstar equivalent of cyberwear)and new monsters to possibly spring on your unsuspecting players. Enchanted armor and equipment(including guns) are discussed here as well. It is an excellant book, but it can be a bit bewildering if you have not read its companion the Starfarer's Handbook first. If you have the basic trilogy(Player Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide and Monster Manual) from Wizards of the Coast, these two offer a bit of fine tuning as well as new option. Keep in mind that Dragonstar fully works within the framework of the Dungeons and Dragons game just that it presents the game within the fabric of a science fiction universe with slight tang of Fantasy for a bit of extra taste and flavor. If you have the money to get all three, buying this with the aforementioned Starfarer's Handbook and Imperial Supply for the same campaign setting will not only give you a lot of enjoyable reading to do but a very complete science fantasy setting that you can use to transport yourself and your players on a magical, mystical journey into uncharted territory where the only limit are the collective imaginations of your group.	2002-12-27

Some of the computer stuff in here will have you thinking of earlier science fantasy setting by FASA called Shadowrun I'm non too sure about that but the same geniuses that brought us Arsenal is going to be visiting this subject Factory(a book I plan on getting without even bothering to paw through first as I found Arsenal to be that good) so we'll know more when it comes out. Standing on its own merits, Imperial Supply crams computer equipment, weapons, armor, robots and vehicles into one book. There is so much gear in here there is not enough room for a prestige class even if they wanted to shoehorn one in, and this a good thing. Vehicles and vehicle design comprise a good hunk of the back of the book but the vehicle design rules are well though out and rather concise making the whole book a nice tool box for customizing a given campaign. Someone else has recommeded geting this with Arsenal and it's a good suggestion, keep in mind that Dragonstar leans more heavily on hard core science fiction in concept and execution than magic where as Arsenal seeks to fully combine the two into a seamless whole. Convergent evolution at its finest compare and contrast these two at you leisure and decide for yourself. Personally, I'm keeping both and using both in the Dragonstar campaign I'm planning.	2002-12-27

Monty Python fans rejoice! Your Holy Handgrenade has arrived! But, seriously, this is a truly wonderful book to wrap your brain around. This book gives you some tools to help create a truly unique science fantasy campaign setting as it partially explores many genres of sci-fi and gives suggestions on how to run them using this book. It also gives each of the main core classes an overview in wake of such powerful new weapons. Many new spells and feats and while they couldn't resist the temptation to add new prestige classes(are we up to a thousand of these things yet?)to the myriad of prestige classes from various sources, the number is kept blissfully short at two and two only with the Sniper for those of us who like the idea of taking out enemies from afar with one shot and the Gunman for your more contemporary action hero. New armor is also presented as well as the borrowed concept of armor as damage reduction. Overall when you're done prancing around in the Dark Ages and want to come back to some semblence of reality or beyond to the future that thankfully never will be or might come after we've all breathed our last then this book is for you. DragonStar fans take note, a lot of this is better than the guns presented as is so you'll have to be careful about what to allow and what to disallow for your own campaigns.	2002-12-19

So it comes of no surprise that someone would want to make this basic type of spellcaster a part of the D20 landscape. The Dungeon Master Guide makes passing reference to the Witch class as a way for DMs to make their own classes but beyond a suggested spell list, not much development is given. Steve Kenson does a wonderful job filling out the class as a worthwhile addition to the base classes. The suggested spell list is expanded with new spells and the hows and why of the type of spellcaster a Witch should be is explained. Keep in mind that the Witch is not not supposed to be someone who gets into the thick of things with spells that fry opponents with Lightning or otherwise reduce an enemy to ash, her magic is much more subtle. No new skills worth noting but a few feats that are good for filling out a Witch's personality and while the selection of Prestige Classes is rather lean what is there is rather interesting with classes to represent the traditional wicked witch, Circe, the Wizard-Priestess and the Crone as well as a warrior oriented class of persons who defend Witches and their covens. Influences of powerful places and times of the year are given some well thought discussions with a calendar of Pagan holidays given as an example from our own world. All in all I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to add this classic type of spellcaster to their campaigns.	2002-11-14

The booklet itself is absolutely necessary to run Scarred Lands not for the adventures, which are not all that great but for the information on the various races of Ghelspad, the main continent used for the adventures in this campaign setting. Between these few pages and the sheer versatility of the screen itself, it's very much worth getting. The adventures are short little nubs good for filler or for when the big adventure you, the DM have been plotting and crafting for a whole week gets flat out rejected or by passed by the characters and you need something quick to fill in. But again, you'll use the reference material in the front a lot more than the adventures and the screen is a DM's little helper par excellant.	2002-10-10

My first impression is that they took the format they used in the first Relics and Rituals(which I loved, especially the Vigilant prestige class) and repeated much of it with new material. Among the great new features includes Astrology as part of the game mechanics for play and a Prestige Class that is basically an old kit from the Shair's Handbook of the old Al-Qadim campaign setting for 2nd Edition(based primarily on 1001 Arabian Nights, good campaign setting to run that kind of campaign) revamped and made a little more divorced from that setting. Spells are nice, I like a few of the enchanted stuff and the rituals are always nice. Tattoo magic was interesting concept and they expanded it in this edition slightly but not at the expense of other sections. All in all, it's a great rescource for the Scarred Lands in particular and D&amp;D/D20 in general.	2002-10-07

Martial arts enthusiasts, you will find several prestige classes and a few feats that you like very much.  The weapon section is almost worth the entire book in of itself. Add to that the fact that they cram in floorplans for several types of fortresses, rules for charioteering(adaptable for other animal drawn vehicles to be sure)and some really neat feats make it well worth it.	2001-10-17

More than Sword and Fist, Defenders of the Faith is geared towards those characters with a religious bent. The four divine spellcasting classes have power-ups here. More spells for you to pray for and an overview of most of the major faiths as described in the Player's Handbook arranged by alignment. The feats are geared more towards clerics and paladins but many of the items in the equipment section can be used by anyone. In fact the illustrations are rather useful for both players and DMs alike. There are even suggestions on how a pc relates to a particular temple as well as how to handle the day to day workings of these houses of worship. While it's geared mainly towards clerics and paladins, rangers and druids will find things they can use here as well.	2001-10-13

I also have the original oriental adventures as well as materials for Kara-Tur. The new Oriental Adventures uses much of the history and mechanics of Rokugan(the world of L5R) with other cultures to produce a book that will provide a lot of options for any campaigns. Japan, China and India are tapped to provide most of the scource material but at it's core are pieces of a great campaign that can be assembled however you like. There's even a section for suggesting how to put it all together. New races, new classes and a boatload of new ideas, all laid out for a dm to pick and choose what they want and what they don't want. Not much on Toturi's Army(my favorite faction due to their wolf mon) but this is a minor quibble. I bought it in the store and was very satisfied with the results.	2001-10-13

Fast forward the time frame a little to the age of steam an age that never existed save in such classics as Jules Verne's 20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea. This first adventure surrounds an evil artifact and one teenage girl's thirst for vengeance. Firearms exist in this adventure so DMs need to be a little wary about the possibility of the PCs getting their hands on them. However they are considered exotic weapons so getting them and using them may not be that much of an option. Privateer Press's website promises further development of this setting if you find you like the idea after running this adventure of a Steampunk style campaign. It's a refreshing idea whose time has come. Looking for a change of view and change of seting to a more &quot;civilized&quot; age? Try this adventure on for size.	2001-07-13

It will also bring much more diversity to the game as many of the monsters contain within have notes on character classes. Now in order to actually play some of these beasties you will need the Player Handbook and many cases the complete book of humanoids(a second edition player's handbook supplemental) for ideas on adjusments to characters stats but all in all, a great book for the new game. It also includes monsters never before scene so you have a good mix of old stand-bys and potential new enemies and allies. A great book that I highly recommend.	2000-10-15

Once I read it, I knew that this was a vast improvement to the game I was playing and in many ways more accessable to those new to the game. I play rangers and was a little dismayed by the fact that they redid followers but then I read the spell list and how rangers get them a little sooner, I like the idea of having a pack of wolves about my ranger to aid him in his endeavors and now he won't have to wait until tenth level to get them. I also like how they redid half-elves and elves. All in all a very good revamping of the system and it makes the game a lot better.	2000-10-08
