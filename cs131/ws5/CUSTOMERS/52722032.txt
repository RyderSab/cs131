The writing has a lovely, bittersweet quality as most of the characters find out that what they were looking for was perhaps not really what they wanted from life.  And of course, being set in WWII time period, the war is a constant presence in the characters lives, motivating, changing, and devastating some of them. Perhaps that's why the author chose her ending - to leave the story on an upbeat note.<br />Overall, an enjoyable book.	2004-07-16

This is the story of Nazneen, a Bengali woman \\"Left to her Fate\\" at birth, who marries and moves to England to marry Chanu, an older, pompous man who seems unable to get anything right. The story follows Nazneen over many years as she grapples with the Big Questions of Life: Is there such a thing as fate?  Can an individual control or influence it?  Are you bound by it?  If this sounds dull, rest assured, it isn't.  This is a wonderful story filled with vibrant, unforgettable characters.  The author does a wonderful job of allowing us to see Nazneen's slow progression from dutiful daughter and wife to quietly confident woman.  What makes it so true to life and keeps the book from being a feminist screed is that she shows that Nazneen's progression is not without hardship: \\"she was as startled by her own agency as an infant who waves a clenched fist and strikes itself upon the eye.\\"<br />Hard to believe that this is a first novel, it is so well-written.  A true pleasure!	2004-04-28

I've really enjoyed other Marian Keyes' novels: \\"Lucy Sullivan\\" and \\"Last Chance Saloon\\" come to mind.  I enjoyed them for the wonderful characters: flawed, but funny and decent people.<br />Unfortunately, the characters in \\"Angels\\" were not sympathetic characters.  Sleep-around Troy, the new age neighbors, Lesbian Lara, it was just one stereotype after another.  And I just wanted to slap Emily, who can't seem to pull herself together enough to realize how worthless the path she's chosen is.<br />The premise of the novel was great: can you, should you, still love/care for/live with someone who has let you down?  How do you steer your marriage through the rough spots?  This thread of the novel was well-written and I could have done with more of it and less of Emily's screen writing adventures.<br />I'm hoping Ms. Keyes' next novel \\"Sushi for Beginners\\" will bring us back to the wonderful type of characters she wrote in earlier books!	2003-06-16

Because of her wonderful literary ability, these stories are vivid and thought-provoking.  They deal with the cultural differences, class differences, and wartime conditions she experienced.

Although this book is going to be a Christmas present for a 7 year old, it was so good that I admit that I thought about keeping it for myself!<br />This picture book tells the story of Ike, a fun-loving dog who gets into trouble once to often.  His person, Mrs. Larue, send him to obedience school, from whence he sends letters to Mrs. Larue describing the \\"awful\\" circumstances of the school.  The joke, which kids will get due to the contradictions between the illustration and text, is that the school is more of a resort than the prison Ike makes it out to be in his letters home.<br />A very funny book with charming illustrations and real way with words.

Although this is an easy read (it's a compelling story and I read it in one sitting - a long sitting, but still) the author does his audience the credit of believing them to have intellectual curiosity.  So, no, he doesn't give you chapter and verse on the motivations of his characters, he leaves you clues and assumes that you can interpret them as you choose.  Hey, you've been warned - the author opens this book saying, &quot;Watch you step.  Keep you wits about you; you will need them.&quot;<br />I thought the characters were fascinating.  Why does Sugar help Agnes?  Perhaps because she sees their similarities and views Agnes as being just as trapped by her position in life as Sugar is.  Hmmm... doesn't sound like a one dimensional character at all.<br />833 of the best pages I've read in years.  Savor them!	2002-11-21

They led interesting lives (two were friends of Hitler, one ran away to the Spanish Civil War with Winston Churchill's communist nephew, one became the Duchess of Devonshire, one wrote best-selling novels based on her family, and one, apparently the sensible one, lived quietly), but this is a family that appeared to court disaster.<br />The story is a tragic one involving a suicide attempt, permanent estrangement, and a great deal of pain within the family.  It's fascinating material for a biographer to work with, yet this book is disappointing.  Lovell tell us what the sisters did, but rarely delves deeply into why they did these things.  And she lets one sister, Diana, an apologist for Hitler, off the hook, saying that Diana is incapable of lying.  Well, perhaps that's true, but I think a more insightful look at her character might have suggested that she is also incapable of seeing the truth about her actions and those of the men she followed.<br />I hope that another biographer will delve more deeply into these women's motives and tell us why such gifted women, with every advantage in life, were so self-destructive.	2002-02-22

I probably never would have picked this book up, except for the glowing reviews it's been getting.  And, are they ever deserved.  This is the story of Bobo Fuller, daughter of gone-to-the-dogs parents in 1970's Rhodesia, on the losing (depending on your point of view) side of a civil war.  Covering her growing-up years of moving from one place to another in Africa always searching for a way to exist in a place where white Africans no longer had power and privilege, Ms. Fuller writes unsparingly, unsentimentally, and honestly about her family and their remarkable experiences. Don't miss this terrific book.	2002-01-06

They range throughout the center of the city, Vasilievsky Island, the Smolny area and the outlying palaces (and full attention is given to five of them rather than just Peterhof and Tsarskoe Selo as in most guidebooks).  It also includes a walk in the Hermitage.  These walks include good maps.  Additionally, this book has excellent sections on the history of the city, customs and various subjects (the &quot;mafia&quot;, icons, vodka, etc.) that provide context for your visit.  The author is an excellent writer who, although she obviously loves the subject, presents a thorough picture.	2001-07-07

I read this book when I was six and enjoyed it very much.  But when I re-read it over 30 years later, I loved it with all my heart.  This is a wonderful story about a mother bunny who never lets go of her dream.  It's a wonderful story for showing the love between mother and child and for inspiring bunnies (and people!) to never give up.  And to think that the author did this without being &quot;preachy&quot;.  I can't think of a better book to read to your children or give to your niece/nephew/grandchild for Easter.

Foreman shows us a woman who had flaws (a gambling habit every bit as bad as a drug habit) but also had imagination, intelligence, drive, and a willingness to live her life apart from the standards of her time.  Combine this character with a husband to whom she was hopelessly unsuited, and an &quot;All About Eve&quot; friend and this book reads like a wonderful novel.  Read and enjoy.	2001-03-09

Let's get right to it:  The middle section of this book which tells the mother's story of her life in China is superb.  This section is a marvelous mixture of myth and reality and is beautifully written. When will Amy Tan give us an entire book like this?<br />And there are other nuggets of good writing in this book, especially when she's writing about writing.<br />But.....haven't we seen this story before?  Mother-daughter conflict, unhappy relationship with live-in boyfriend, self-worth problems.  Since I've read Ms. Tan's previous books, this all seemed pretty familiar to me, almost formulaic.<br />Overall, the book seemed to have a number of interesting ideas that should have been developed more fully.  For example, is this a book about memories, about secrets, about language, about caring for aging yet independent parents?  Any one of these ideas deeply and insightfully developed would have led to a better book.  As a wonderful professor once told me, &quot;say more about less.&quot;	2001-02-27

It is indeed a panorama - as the author notes, volumes could be written abut the events covered in any single chapter - but it has telling details that make for memorable reading.  For example, the author illuminates the terror that Stalin's purges caused by telling a story of a disagreement between two upper-level communist party members over what star they saw in the sky.  They sent a secret policeman to the country's top astronomer who promptly died of a heart attack upon seeing him.  The next astronomer in line committed suicide by throwing himself out a window when he was summoned.  Such memorable illustrations of the times are noted throughout the book and bring this terrible decade to life.	2001-01-03

Why? Because every time we go to one of the parks (remember there are 4 theme parks here plus 3 water parks), we always see people having a miserable time!  It doesn't have to be that way, and this book is great for showing people ways to avoid the misery and enjoy the fun.  Don't worry about doing everything the book recommends, but read it and you'll have a much better idea of how to get the best Disney experience for your family/group.  The one area that this book could improve upon is its lodging information which has breadth but not much depth.  In other words, you'll get hotel names, phone numbers, and value ratings, but no descriptions of the properties which vary widely, trust us!  For the best information on accommodations, try Frommers.  PS-the author's not kidding about the importance of comfortable shoes and sunscreen!	2000-10-08

True, this is not Ms. Pilcher's finest work: for that, see either  &quot;September&quot; or &quot;Shell Seekers&quot;.  Still, there are some  things she does well.  I liked the premise of unhappy people coming  together at Christmas, and thinking they'll just try to get through the  &quot;happy season&quot;, then finding real happiness.  The character of  Lucy seemed very real to me when thinking of some of the lonely, indeed  nearly abandoned teens I see today.  Finally, no one, absolutely no one,  can describe a house like Rosamunde Pilcher can.  I don't know that that  matters greatly in a writer, but even though I'm not in the least domestic  myself, I find her descriptions of gardens and house to be terribly  soothing (perhaps the insomnia reviewer was right in that regard, we just  had different reactions to it!).  Yes, the ending of the story is  predictable, but you don't buy a Rosamunde Pilcher novel for shock endings  and radical surprises.  Generally speaking, they're literary comfort food,  and we could all use a little comfort.	2000-08-20

This year, however, he gets &quot;Dumb Bunnies&quot;.  Why?  Because  it's silly, funny, and will make him laugh out loud.  And, in my opinion,  it's harmless fun.

I don't know  about the rest of you who've read it, but I could spot every plot  development well before it happened - not much of a mystery.  Anyhow, the  rest of the book was great, especially the section called  &quot;Possession&quot; which had fascinating ideas on how people can be  possessed by ideas, by other people, by their circumstances in life; and  about who &quot;possesses&quot; nature.  The character of the narrator,  Louisa, was very well-drawn, substantial, recognizable, and interesting.  Overall, I'd say read this novel for its interesting ideas and main  character.	1999-08-29
