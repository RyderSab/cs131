The English is contemporary, the wording generally clear and uncluttered. <br /> <br />Most of the caveats are found in the introduction.  By the way, if you're not in the habit of reading Bible translation introductions, I highly recommend it.  A little careful reading of the intro. will yield valuable dividends in your studies, and in weighing the pros and cons of different translations. <br /> <br />Basically this is categorized as a \\"thought-for-thought\\" translation, as opposed to a literal, or \\"word-for-word\\" translation.  Which is good in terms of readablity.  But something will inevitably be lost in the process, so it weakens its value as a study Bible. <br /> <br />If you believe in the inspiration of scripture, then you would have to believe that the words, as well as the thoughts, are important.  Thoughts are more nebulous than words, hence, translation of thoughts becomes much more subjective, and prone to the translator's bias, intentional or unintentional. <br /> <br />Take as an example, Matt. 7:13 in the NLT, \\"The highway to hell is broad and its gate wide for the many who choose the easy way\\"  As the footnote says, though, it is \\"the way that leads to destruction\\" which Jesus is referring to.  A check of an interlinear or Greek Bible will reveal that Matthew did not use the Greek word Hades, which translates \\"Hell\\".  So the translators have added their own spin, changing Jesus' words to fit their own theology.  Every translator will do this to some degree, but the reader needs to be aware when he is reading the translator's thoughts, not the Bible writer's thoughts.  In almost every case where the New Living Translation has opted to footnote a verse, I find the footnoted rendering to be more accurate, and hence, preferable. <br /> <br />The introduction also reveals that cultural idioms have been revised, to make them more understandable to the modern reader.  However, a literal translation that presents them as they were written can offer valuable insights into the cultural milieu of the Bible's writers - you wont get that with the New Living Translation. <br /> <br />The NLT follows the pack of modern translations in substituting LORD or GOD for the divine name.  This is a whole area of controversy, and this is not the place to address that controversy.  Just to note that the NLT translators, like most others, have taken it upon themselves to eliminate something that the original Bible contained, changing it to fit an agenda which prefers not to include the divine name in those thousands of instances where it was originally included in the Bible. <br /> <br />The footnotes of the NLT, as mentioned, are valuable.  The meaning of Bible names are sometimes footnoted, and many times when a verse contains a pun or a play on words, it is footnoted.  Footnotes in the New Testament alert readers to quotes from the Old Testament, but unfortunately, the verse quoted is NOT footnoted in the Old Testament portion, a sad omission. <br /> <br />Overall a very readable modern translation, and worth having a copy of.  Along with this I would recommend The Interlinear Bible by Jay Green (a very literal translation, along with the interlinear word-for-word), and Truth in Translation by Jason Beduhn.	2005-04-05

I am interested in the plight of those who live and think outside the box, and who overcome special challenges.  The beginning was very strong, and contained some poignant and poetic prose passages (it does also contain some poetry, which struck me as less than memorable). <br /> <br />But once the book shifted over to the author's sexual proclivities and activities, it was almost like another author had taken over.  The tone became whiney and self-absorbed.   <br /> <br />From that point on, the book remained wildly inconsistent, with some great passages, in the midst of mundane musings worthy of an adolescent's diary.  The author's non-mainstream sexual preferences are given thorough coverage, and I wasn't quite sure of the reason.   <br /> <br />In the end, I have to say it was a noble effort for an autistic person to have written such a book, and I suspect that fact may have wow'ed reviewers into giving it higher marks than it merits.  Any book must be judged on its own merit, and the quality of writing is too inconsistent to rate much more than 3 stars.	2004-10-18

This welcome treatise might appropriately be subtitled: \\"To Boldly Go Where No Man Has Gone Before,\\" as it takes a hard, objective look at the accuracy of our popular New Testament Bibles in a way that hasn't been done before (at least any time recently, to my knowledge - and I've been looking for a long time).<br />The author must be credited for his boldness in tackling this volatile subject with such an objective approach, as he adds up the score card of accuracy (plus points) and bias (minus points) on 9 very popular New Testament translations.<br />If your favorite is in here (mine is), you will be challenged by the information in this book.  But also, hopefully, inspired to dig deeper, think harder, pray more, and search ever more diligently, as you evaluate those cherished beliefs which are based on your favorite Bible translation.  There are winners (two very surprising translations stand out from the rest) and losers (again, two others are rated so low that the author contends they shouldn't be called \\"Bibles\\" at all, but labeled as \\"Commentaries\\"), but absolutely none remain unscathed by Beduhn's burning textual spotlight.<br />The author is detailed and specific - nothing vague or nebulous about his approach.  The Greek original is shown (in \\"interlinear\\" English), and the 9 are lined up for comparison.  The criteria and conclusions are explained in detail, in layman's terminology that is easy to follow (in just a very few places the book lapses into technical jargon that I had to struggle with).  The author must be credited with bringing us non-Greek-speaking Bible adherents one step closer to the Greek manuscripts upon which all modern New Testament translations are based.<br />The 9 translations discussed are the King James (or Authorized Version), the Amplified Bible, the Living Bible, the New American Bible, the New American Standard Bible, the New International Version, the New Revised Standard Version, the New World Translation, and Today's EnglishVersion.  The verses chosen for analysis are so clearly explained that any translation could be tested, so the book will be of equal benefit to those who might favor another less popular translation.<br />I can't say I agree with every conclusion that the author reaches, but I'm grateful for his opening this dialogue, and for doing so with an obviously studied attempt to avoid bias and polemics himself, a rarity among textual critics.  I paid a little more for this book (the softcover edition) than I usually do, but it was worth every penny.  This is a thoughtful and thought-provoking work that should be welcomed by any who are curious about the accuracy of our modern Bibles, and by all who look to their Bible for life-giving words of truth ~ for it is only by the truth that we are set free.  <br />As a parting note to the author: You challenged my beliefs and my Bible, so I would like to make this challenge to you...(it's so obvious that your book begs the comment without my saying it) - Produce and publish a New Testament of your own, one that scores 100% on your Truth in Translation scale.  I'll be one of the first to buy it and review it.  Note: a complimentary review copy would help =)	2004-01-26

The author is overly enamored with the affected elegance and churchiness of the King James Bible, and shows it to be the work, not of men of God, but men of the Church - clever, wealthy, powerful, politically motivated church literati (Protestant and Puritan) of Jacobean England.<br />The work is born of an enthusiasm for the men and the times that gave birth to that noble and beloved translation, and a celebration of the decidedly un-spiritual and worldly atmosphere it breathed.  Vernacular versions are bashed, from Tyndale to the Twentieth Century.<br />There is a good deal of material about the scholars, but disappointingly, very little about the scholarship that went into the translation - no details of the particular recensions used (we know that Erasmus' Textus Receptus was the basis of the King James' New Testament, but we hear little of it or it's history here).  The King James Bible, it turns out, was essentially a cut-and-paste job, from the contemporary versions of the day.  The author admits as much, but some insights into the use of original-language manuscripts and recensions would have been apropos - very little is said on the subject.<br />The author does not appear to be a serious student of textual transmission, and his occasional forays into exegesis are hard to take seriously.  And I personally couldn't subscribe to his nostalgia for an age where religious passion for a churchly authoritarianism results in the death of innocent dissidents, nor could I appreciate the parallel drawn between Jacobean religious intensity and the beliefs of modern day religious terrorists.  <br />As for the author's ridicule of all Bible translations guilty of a blunt simplicity, lacking in ornamentation - if this is a crime, it was the crime of the original.  The New Testament was written in Koine Greek, the workingman's Greek, what one scholar called the \\"coffee and doughnuts\\" Greek - a plain and unpretentious language of the everyday person.<br />To people like William Tyndale, and many others since, the beauty is in the message, not in the eloquence of language used to express the message.  By the author's own admission, the King James Bible was written in an affected, formalized literary English that was never spoken, not even at the time it was written, based on an antiquated English of a previous century.<br />Still, the King James Bible is a very good translation for all it's shortcomings, which the author argues persuasively.  The story of it's creation is interesting, and there is an attempt to explain the Jacobean literary influence by likening it to an architecture enamored with overt ornamentation and overlay, married to a utilitarian simplicity of egalitarian elegance.<br />The book jumps around quite a bit, wandering off in various and sundry tangents, exploring this tenuous detail, then that.  In spite of which, it remains relatively readable and informative.  I learned something of the circumstances and milieu that gave birth to this most popular translation.  <br />If you think the King James Bible is the be-all do-all of Bible translations, you'll probably enjoy this book.  If you lean toward a vernacular, colloquial rendition, be prepared to have your feathers ruffled.  And don't expect a scholarly look at the textual geneology of the King James translation from this enjoyable but rambling essay.	2004-01-11
US	51148121	R2125NFI5L4H0F	0195127366	383795949	In Discordance with the Scriptures: American Protestant Battles Over Translating the Bible (Religion in America)	Books	4	14	15	N	N	RSV - NIV American Bible Translation Battle Review!	The subtitle is American Protestant Battles Over Translating the Bible, but the heart of the book is really the RSV (Revised Standard Version) vs. NIV (New International Version) controversy.  The curtain of public veneer is pulled back on the ideological translation wars, to reveal a compelling tale rife with politics, posturing, and power struggles.<br />The introduction gets off on the wrong foot, with some esoteric blather about epistemological hermeneutics (or some such sespequedalian verbiage) and iconoclastic biblicism, that seemed pointless to me, other than as filler.  I suggest you skip the introduction and get right into the book itself. Early on, the author takes some unwarranted stabs at William Tyndale, that only aggravated the situation.<br />But once you get into the controversies surrounding the Revised Standard Version translation, the author hits his stride, and the fascinating story behind this influential translation begins to unfold.  Then the fundamentalist-reactionary NIV is introduced, and the plot thickens palpably.  Great nuts-and-bolts, blood-and-guts reading.  I found myself almost unable to put the book down at this point, since this subject fascinates me, and it seems very little is written on the subject.  This battlefield history is obviously the author's strong suit, and he plays it well.  <br />He comes across with a hard-boiled cynicism, that at times can be a little grating, and at other times, gives his work an edge.  When he philosophizes about the implications of various ideologies, he seems on less solid ground.  His observations are trenchant without being incisive.  Ultimately, the author's thesis was unclear in my mind.  Should Bible translators NOT strive to get closer to a perfect ideal of the &quot;inspired original?&quot;  What role should religious bias play in the translation process?<br />But no matter.  Despite that, and despite an ending that fizzles rather abruptly, the strength of the story survives its weaknesses, and what emerges is a fascinating, well-researched and well-documented battle history of Christendom's American Bible Translation Civil War of the mid-century.   I wish such a treatise was available for every translation out there!	2004-01-04

This book was a real treat for me - I've been bogged down in scholarly treatises of late, and it came as a breath of fresh air to find this small, simple, and concise overview of the scrolls and their impact some 40 years after discovery.  The controversies, the gossip, and most importantly (to me), the impact on textual criticism - all are discussed in a clear and understandable way.  Its easy to underestimate the value of a small, simple book, but believe me, wordiness does not equal value, and good things still come in small packages...this one is a gem!	2004-01-02

His style of writing is spare but powerful (\\"As I witnessed the Hitler Youth parades, my blood turned to ice.  I beheld the heaving of swastika flags.  I saw the edge of the abyss.\\")  He describes the false security, then the confusion, and finally, the despair of the Jewish situation in Nazi Germany.<br />He himself was imprisoned in Auschwitz (his father's hometown), Sachsenhausen, and Neuengamme.  Like all the concentration camp victims, he witnessed atrocities it is painful even to read about.  He carried his father's dead body to the mass crematorium, the last tiny dignity he could bestow upon a broken man.  <br />Never bitter, he describes his wonder at the pervasiveness of the virulent anti-Jewish sentiment that swept the nation.  During his incarceration and torment, he converted from Judaism to a messianic Christianity, \\"Bibelforschers,\\" who were prevalent in the concentration camps.  Not the doctrine so much as the living examples of faith that he witnessed won him over - he describes the inner tranquility and compassion that attracted him to the group.<br />His book is valuable on several counts, probably moreso than I can fathom at present.  I enjoyed the insights into his traditional Jewish upbringing and belief system - the faith that to him was Judaism.  He describes the differences between the devout and the peripheral practicer, the country and the city Jew.  I was touched by the faith of his father, even in such bleak and hopeless surroundings, pronouncing a traditional Jewish blessing on his son, just prior to his own death.  And I was surprised at the insight the book gave to the tragic plight of even many Nazis - imprisoned by an ideology futureless and dying, from which there seemed no escape but death.  <br />It was enlightening to see the juxtaposition of the strength and yet frailty of the human psyche - an unbroken inner dignity of faith, but yet a latent emotional frailty in the wake of such numbing human cruelty - to the point that a visit to the site of such trauma provoked a heart attack in the author even some half-century after the fact.<br />Mostly, I think the benefit of this work is the lesson that survival of the spirit is dependent, not upon an abstract or intellectual faith of doctrine or dogma, but upon a human bond of pragmatic love and recognition of the dignity of the human condition, even in the most vile and desperate surroundings - a faith that is lived in the heart, not merely professed with the mouth.  This is what saved Max Liebster in the true sense of the word, and I think there is a lesson for all of us in that fact.<br />I can't imagine anyone reading this important biography and not being moved, but then I can't imagine those who could perpetrate such atrocities - and yet they were everyday people, as Mr. Liebster demonstrates.  A study in the dichotomy of the human condition: cruelty and kindness; weakness and strength; desperation and faith, fear and love.  Recommended to students of the Holocaust, of the Jewish and the \\"other\\" victims, to students of the reaction of the human condition when under test in what truly is a \\"crucible of terror.\\"<br />My only complaint is that the book ended too quickly - I wanted more!  I almost gave it a 4 instead of a 5, for this reason, but in the end I couldn't think of what else it needed, only that I resented it ending so quickly.  Which may, in the final analysis, be more of a positive than a negative - so I'm going with 5 after all.  An important and thought-provoking work.	2003-12-28
US	51148121	R27L3FZMBO1AD1	0310220211	668177661	The Book of God	Books	3	110	132	N	N	The Bible as a Novel - NOT	I read the book because I enjoy comparing different translations of the Bible, but way too many liberties are taken with the Bible narrative to qualify for the sub-title THE BIBLE AS A NOVEL. It has some good points - it flows well, and reads easily. Certain Bible stories are brought to life and fleshed out, with a good feel for the climate, topography and geography of the Bible lands. But when you read it, have a literal translation of the Bible handy, along with a comprehensive concordance, and a good Bible encyclopedia. <br />Inexplicably, the book skips some of the great Bible stories altogether. The \\"sons of God\\" who fathered the Nephilim, precipitating the flood - not mentioned. The account of Esther - nope. Nor Naaman. Nor Job. Nor Jonah. Shadrach, Meschach and Abedndgo are on leave. Daniel in the lion's den - a no show. The handwriting on Belshazzar's wall - erased. The account of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram was apparently devoured by the editor's fire. Dinah's unfortunate incident with Shechem - not there. Nabal's rude rebuke and Abigail's averting of disaster are not mentioned. Gone is the account of a handful of David's mighty men risking their lives to boldly enter a Philistine stronghold just to get David a drink of water, and him refusing it, so angry was he at their cavalier disregard for the sanctity of human life - their own! <br />Of course, to put the story in novel format, there would necessarily have to be some interpolation.  But the author's creativity leaves a lot of the accounts sounding very different from the Bible version. Esau's relinquishing of his birthright isn't caused by a lack of appreciation for spiritual things, its just that Jacob is a fast-talker, like a used-car salesman, bilking him as he hovers near death-by-starvation. In the account of Uzzah's irreverent handling of the ark of the covenant, which cost him his life, now we find the whole affair resulting from a mis-step in some ox doo-doo. You won't find that detail in any Bible I'm aware of. <br />After Tamar is raped by Amnon, she falls in romantic love with another half-brother, Solomon! Again, what Bible is that in? In fact, Wangerin has Tamar uttering words of the Shulemite maiden (of the Song of Solomon) - but she's pining, unrequited, for King Solomon's love! His Jews are prescient, viewing the divine name as \\"ineffable\\", following a tradition a thousand years before it's development. They speak to God in antiquated language, an affected formalism not present in any of the original Bible accounts.  <br />In the account of Jesus' conception, Joseph is a widower before he weds the virgin Mary, and old enough to be her father. When Mary takes off to visit her relative Elizabeth for some 3 months, her parents at first assume she's shacking up with Joseph, who is remodeling their house. Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist, makes nails for a living, works on the Sabbath, and dutifully fulfills an order for some crucifixion spikes for Herod to hang his sons with! <br />Here is a Jesus who, like the pagan Romans, shaves his beard! (Wouldn't this be unlikely for any Jewish man in the first century, other than in times of mourning?). When he heals a man, he yells at him angrily not to tell anyone. This Jesus doesn't base his teachings on the Bible, but makes up his own teachings!  A disciple (Andrew) weeps in sorrow when chosen to be an apostle, viewing the privilege as a death sentence! Most egregious is the lack of the dynamic Kingdom message - Wangerin's Good News is just about repentence and forgiveness, the Kingdom of God, such a dominant theme in Jesus' teachings, is only barely mentioned in passing. <br />Judas is a good guy - his betrayal of Jesus is motivated by an altruistic urge to force Jesus' hand to accept his messianic political calling! Herod's role in the trial of Jesus is completely left out. The night-time kangaroo court at Caiphas' house, rife with perjury, and the ensuing hearing before Pilate, where threats of mob violence and slander are used to extort an illegitimate and unwarranted judgement - all of this is declared perfectly legal. The account of Ananias and Saphira didn't make it in, apparently dying at the editor's transom. <br />There were portions of the narrative I enjoyed very much. And if it stimulates interest in the Bible, I think that's great. But be forewarned - proceed with caution: the Bible it isn't.	2003-12-25

One is introduced to the story of the scrolls, their exciting discovery, and their contribution to our understanding of the history surrounding the Jewish nation and culture - as well as some of the challenges and controversies that have attended the handling of the scrolls by an elite group.<br />Almost every scholar who has anything to say about the scrolls has indulged in a little over-interpolation or over-extrapolation, which is to say, reading more into the scrolls than is actually there.  Examples of this are the sensational claims made by some that the scrolls contained evidence that John the Baptist was an Essene, or that Christianity was based on Qumran doctrines - all unfounded speculation, of course.  You'll find a little of that in here, but the discerning reader can filter it out, if you keep in mind that scholars are just people, and they like to gossip, speculate, and run off at the imagination as much as the rest of us do.  And you'll find an equal dose of myth-debunking here too, exposing the folly of some of the sensationalism.<br />I like this collection of essays, and consider it a valuable window to the mysterious world of Qumran and its hidden scroll collection.  Recommended.	2003-12-23

I liked Dunning's Cliff Janeway novels, and I liked this one, although I would have preferred another Janeway, given a choice.  Still, Dunning's mysteries always rise above the grocery-store paperback level, with more literary aspirations.<br />The book is a WWII-era noir fiction historical mystery with a tie-in to old time radio drama when it wasn't quite yet old time.  There are mysterious disappearances, hints of subterfuge and espionage, references to historical atrocities that have been covered-up or ignored, a few surprising scenes that are graphically macabre, and some sexual explicitness that adds nothing to the story.   Dunning is a very good writer, with occasional flashes of brilliance, and the book is close enough to a great book that I feel compelled to express my frustration at its foibles.<br /> Eastern Wartime has a compelling mystery at its heart, at least it starts out that way.  But it seems to get thinned out along the way, only to be resuscitated at the end.  Too much sidetracking with the goings-on at a certain radio station, to the point some of the mystery atmosphere lapses for pages at a time.  A flaw with all Dunning's characters is that they appear to be emotionally stilted, unable to access their feelings at times, unable to  sustain emotion beyond a paragraph or two, at others.  Which takes something away from their otherwise human complexity.  And many of the characters are painted so vaguely that I couldn't remember who they were or what they were doing there. <br />The \\"historical\\" atmosphere is weak, and unlike Caleb Carr's Alienist (with which it is compared on the jacket blurb), I would frequently forget that the story was taking place in another era.  Another minor irritation is that Dunning can't resist taking pot-shots at the Bible and at religious faith.  I'll line up with the rest who detest religious hypocrisy and duplicity in the name of God, but I resent being proselytized to the secular humanist cause.  Again, these littleforays add nothing to the book, and only serve to weaken the story line.  <br />Still, the mystery kept me guessing, and the sense of comeraderie and creativity was almost palpable in the radio drama scenes, which comprise a large part of the story.  A character named Anne Riordan makes a cameo appearance, in a nod to Ray Chandler's Philip Marlowe books, which have clearly influenced Dunning.   I'm not sure if 4 stars is too many, or two few.  It is, when all is said and done, a very good book.  I just hope Dunning can raise the bar a notch or two for his next effort, (hopefully a Cliff Janeway novel), as he's certainly shown he's capable of it.	2003-08-07

I thoroughly enjoyed this scholarly but readable review of the historical context of the formation of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and the Divinity of Christ. Sometimes it seems as though certain doctrines were handed down from on high, and it's very revealing to look behind the scenes, as it were, to find a very human conflict colored by power struggles and political posturing. <br />If you've ever wondered what all the fuss about \\"Arian heresy\\" is really based on, and why the \\"Athanasian Creed\\" is so widely accepted today, you'll want to read about the pendulum swings of power, prestige, and persecution attending these two influential thinkers, Athanasius and Arius.<br />I think the author did a tremendous job of making church history come alive, giving personality and flavor to the tumultuous times and great names of the early church. I hope we hear more from Mr. Rubenstein - I'd love to hear his rendition of the history of textual transmission!	2003-06-12

His contribution to the English language has been largely overlooked, and Daniell labors to correct that oversight. William Tyndale worked almost alone, unaided by his church, virtually exiled from his homeland, to translate the Bible from the original Greek (and later, Hebrew) into the English vernacular of the common working man, and at the risk and eventual cost of his life. Before Tyndale's affordable printed English New Testament, the only copies of the Bible available in England were either in Latin, which very few people understood, or a few copies of Wycliffe's Lollard Bible, an awkward handwritten version based on the Latin Vulgate.<br />Tyndale bucked the incredible power of the 16th century church, burdened by its bias against a vernacular English translation, and showed outstanding scholarship in producing one the most remarkable Bible translations in the history of the English Bible. He was outspoken in courageously opposing both the official church policy and the hypocrisy of its clergy. He owed a great debt to Luther, yet, as Daniell so well demonstrates, he remained independent from Lutheran bias and dogma, despite the persecution he undeservedly received as a result of the prevailing anti-Lutheran (and anti-Lollard) sentiment.<br />One area that the book clearly demonstrates is the bitter and virulent opposition to Tyndale from Thomas Moore - it transcended all reason, reducing the renowned scholar Moore (\\"A Man for all Seasons\\") into a foul-mouthed firebrand. History has painted Mr. Moore far tamer than his anti-Tyndale writings would indicate.<br />The book is a treasure, and all students of textual transmission, and the history of the English language, owe a large debt of gratitude to Mr. Daniell. It does have a few weaknesses worthmentioning: the book gives us Tyndale the translator, but alas, Tyndale the man remains an enigma. This is not Daniell's fault, but the result of the dearth of biographical material on the man who so often lived and worked in clandestine anonymity. And one might well accuse Daniell of overstating his case from time to time, but I suppose history's oversight of Tyndale's true accomplishments may well merit the sometimes heavy-handed treatment. <br />Overall, well worth the read, and one that you will come away from with a newfound appreciation for the faith and Christian humility of this great and largely overlooked scholastic genius.	2003-06-09

Thomas has put together a bit of information on the modern translations of the Bible in popular use today (& some which are not popularly used), as well as the history of the English Bible, to present a readable, if not overly sophisticated, introduction to translations and the textual criticism underlying them .<br />The historical information is on a grade-school level, but the background information on the King James translation committee is a welcome entry to a large void of common misunderstanding and ignorance of the origins of this revered version, and a real plus to the value of the book.<br />The author leans toward a literal translation, and rightly so, in this reviewer's opinion. A helpful chart lists several translations in use today and their degree of literalness or looseness in conforming to the original language texts. <br />Unfortunately, the section on theological bias gives little clarification of it's legitimate role in translating, and promotes that idea that one should shop around for a translation to buttress one's own theological bent. Translations that veer from the author's own pet theological bias are clearly denigrated for doing so, even if their renderings are philologically accurate.<br />In line with the title, the author throughout promotes the notion that everyone should pick the ONE Bible translation that will be the basis of their faith. Oddly, it is not suggested that a Christian might regularly use and study several different translations, and no encouragement is given toward the use of an interlinear translation with a lexicon.<br />Still, for readability, for the information on the King James translation committee, for the useful chart on literalness vs looseness (I find myself consulting it frequently, as I build my collection of different translations), and for valuing literalness in a translation, I rate this book a 3-plus, and recommend it as a starting point for someone desiring to embark on the road to the studyof the modern Bible translation, and the history of its textual transmission.	2003-04-15

This book, the entire Bible in the original languages, with an interlinear English translation, as well as a marginal literal translation, and Strong's numbering over the original language words, is a welcome addition to the library of any sincere student of God's Word.  I think this is the first complete Bible, Hebrew &amp; Aramaic as well as Greek scriptures, in interlinear format with marginal translation.<br />I love this book for Bible study.  I can see what the original language states, and using Strong's system, I can then go to a lexicon and research the meaning of the original word.  Like many students of the Bible, I am skeptical of paraphrased and other translations that take liberties with the Biblical text.  Green obviously has a deep respect for the Word of God, and doesn't play loose with wording while translating. <br />While I have heard that Westcott &amp; Hort's Greek text is more accurate than the Textus Receptus that Green used here, I consider that a minor point.  <br />The drawbacks that must be mentioned: The single-volume edition, which I have, is large and unwieldy, with tiny print that can strain the eyes if used extensively.  At least the print quality is good - very crisp and clear.  There is a 4-volume edition, but it can be rather costly.  Eventually I'll probably invest in one, 'though.  One point I question: the inclusion of &quot;a few readings&quot; from the Latin Vulgate which the author clearly states are NOT considered as &quot;true scripture&quot;, but which are included anyway, with the appendix serving as &quot;corrective&quot; - WHY?  I'm of the opinion that if its not true scripture, it doesn't belong in with the inspired canon.	2003-01-18

It is handsomely bound, with a beautiful glossy cover, in a comfortable size and weight, and with a very user-friendly typeface. <br />I've been searching for a good, modern, doctrinally neutral history of the Bible text from ancient manuscripts to compilation/recension to modern translation, and thought I might have finally found it. But I was mistaken.<br />After four chapters worth of heavy-handed doctrinal polemics, I decided to close the book and look elsewhere. I want a research thesis, not a Sunday School theology lesson! The author seems unable to set aside his desire to promote his own pet theological bias (and to denegrate all others), and just focus on the objective history of the Bible text. Which is fine for a church lesson-book, but inappropriate in a scholarly treatise in layman's language.<br />I bought the book based on the strength of several of the reviews I read here on amazon's site, as well as the praise from the back cover, all from sources I respect. But I just couldn't go with the crowd on this one, I have to call it as I see it. A real disappointment. <br />I got much more benefit from OUR AGELESS BIBLE by Thomas Leishman and THE MAKING OF THE ENGLISH NEW TESTAMENT by Edgar Goodspeed, both of which are basic introductory texts, but unfortunately out-of-print.	2002-12-12

Do I recall that Pat Taylor Allanson served as the model for Caleb Carr's cold-blooded, manipulative, and realistic if fictional \\"Libby\\" in his chilling classic \\"Angel of Darkness\\"? If she didn't, she certainly could have.<BR><br />The tale of a monster? Perhaps, but a common monster, one that breeds and multiplies and festers in the milieu of our modern society, that arises again and again, in ever more resistant strains, to test the limits of our enfeebled enforcement and justice systems.<BR><br />Ms. Rule adroitly demonstrates the chameleon nature of the sociopath, the quicksilver-like ability to evade culpability and responsibility, while churning a carnage-laden path of ruined lives and festering emotional trauma through the lives of those who love them. We sense the frustration of a legal system than can never adequately resolve those crimes against the innocent which ultimately only a higher power can fully and fairly address, as is acknowledged in the novel's concluding and ironic axiom.<BR><br />A fascinating read (I read it in about 3 long sittings) for those willing to wade into the restricting mire of non-idyllic reality far removed from Hollywood fantsies of quick revenge and violent retribution. Recommended.	2002-10-24

Its a raconteur's culinary romp only thinly disguised as a mystery, too busy having fun restaurant-hopping and people-watching to make much effort at anything deeper.  The characters are likeable, if somewhat two-dimensional, the story line is plausible, the satire palpable.  The book pokes fun at the effette artistic pretenses and materialistic snobbery of the rich and famous, while drooling over the culinary escapades their incomes allow.  <br />What it lacks in plot-layering and tension-building, it makes up for in the upbeat tempo of the bon vivant lifestyle.  I could have done without the salacious innuendos and the veiled chauvenism, but it was mild enough, and in the end I just gave in to the gaiete de coeur.	2002-09-25

Roberta Ritter teen sleuth extraordinaire is about to find out how ugly the truth can be, and in the process not only will she blow the perpetrator's cover, but she'll ultimately carve a new identity for herself light years beyond anyone's expectations.<br />A coming-of-age teen sleuth novel for the new millenium, Crusader gives us a teen protagonist who is up to the task of taking on the sordid world of video violence and subsurface racism, of politically correct hypocrisies and parental failures, and manages to emerge not only intact, but the stronger for it.  <br />Lively, entertaining, and flirting with controversy, the story's main weakness seems to be that it tries, in the end, to be too many things to too many people.  The point of view seems fragmented by the time we reach the roller-coaster credibility-straining end, but it's a fun ride nonetheless.<br />Recommended for teens and young adults, the book is a lively read for the rest of us also.  We can only hope that Bloor will continue to hone his skills, and we welcome his worthy contributions to this much-neglected genre.	2002-04-05
US	51148121	R2QQRSCWOJEB64	0439286034	932563878	Tangerine	Books	4	2	2	N	N	a refreshing new voice in young adult literature	Tangerine is a teen coming-of-age story you can really sink your teeth into - but be careful, this one bites back!  Edward Bloor has done a phenomenal job of weaving some thought-provoking social and environmental issues into this teenage tale of self-discovery and self-respect, with an underlying theme of the imbalance of sports-worship in our society.<br />The book is not a mystery per se, but it has elements of the mystery novel: how did Paul Fisher lose most of his eyesight?  What are the haunting memories that tease, torment, and elude him?  Who is robbing Paul's neighborhood pond of the resident koi fish?  Who is robbing Paul's neighbors of their valuables?<br />Paul Fisher is a young man to be contended with as he seeks to find the truth in himself, and the painful honesty of the events that have shaped his young life.  We just wish Bloor would give us someone else to admire in this novel of the hype and shallow hypocrisies of the suburban school sports scene.<br />Ultimately, the ambiguity that makes Paul Fisher, A.K.A. \\"Mars\\" and \\"Fish-Man\\", a three-dimensional character, and that makes life in Tangerine, Florida akin to life in a real-world suburban community, is also the achilles tendon of the novel.  It's strength, in the end, has also become it's weakness.  <br />While lamenting his parents' (and the community's) sports-mania imbalance, Paul Fisher also revels in his own sports accomplishments and in the glory it brings to him, if for but a fleeting moment.  While decrying the violence of his sociopath brother, Paul Fisher revels in the war mentality and bloodletting of his own team associates.  While contemning the brutality of the \\"gangsta\\" culture, Paul Fisher revels in being feared as a 'bad dude' when an impulsive act of violence puts him at odds with the authorities.<br />This is a minor flaw, possibly erring only by degree (a subjective matter at best), outweighted by the strengths of a strong plot, convincing simile, strong character development(in the case of the protagonist), and hard-hitting action scenes that at times are outright stunning.  <br />A good read.  I would like to see a sequel, or even a series.  Paul Fisher, like Grisham's Ricky Sway (The Client) is a teen character worth spending time with.	2002-03-06

But his plot is too loose and disjointed, and the story's potential is never fully explored, like it is in his earlier works.  Has success spoiled John Grisham?  This book argues: Yes.  And yet, it has flashes of brilliance that seem to indicate he may have a classic in him yet.<br />He's on familiar territory with his southern childhood setting, ala The Client (abeit first person narrative is a new and enjoyable variation).  I picked up shades of Ivan Doig, Mark Twain, and even Steinbeck.  Oh yes, and Ricky Sway too.  The problem is that Grisham has departed from his home-ground legal-thriller venue, and hasn't found his sea legs yet.  <br />I enjoyed the vignettes of southern life, of the hardscrabble cotton farming business, of family life and rural life in Arkansas in the 50's.  I enjoyed his character development, and I liked Luke, the 7-year old protagonist (do seven-year olds really use words like &quot;cajole&quot;?).  But in the end, the characters seemed little more than passing acquaintances, the story unmemorable if enjoyable.  A good read, not a page-burner, and not up to Grisham's potential.	2002-03-02

Walsh did his homework in analyzing the details of Rick, Ilsa, Renault and Victor Lazlo's pasts, and I don't think the blame for his inability to really pin down their personalities can be laid entirely at his doorstep - after all, the script of the film had been worked on by many different hands, the characters themselves were inconsistent in the film (which actually contributed a sense of realism), and much of the characters' backgrounds and motivations were left to the viewer's imagination.  <br />The book involves an assassinatin plot on famous Nazi Reinhard Heidrich, who is tall, slender, handsome, and elegant in this fiction, unlike the wide-hipped large-bottomed homely Heidrich of historical reality.  And while Walsh casts him as a Hitler admirer, historically it is probably more accurate to say that Heidrich resented the Feuhrer, viewing himself as more qualified to lead the nation.  There is some speculation that Hitler felt Heidrich a threat, and in fact Heidrich's widow swears that he was recovering nicely from the bombing, when Hitler put him in the care of his private physician, followed shortly thereafter by Heidrich's death.  <br />All this aside, 'though, the book is an entertaining read (if not exactly a page-burner) for those who long for another story with the familiar cast and crew of one of the most beloved films of all time.	2002-02-11

Another noir classic by the master, in this episode detective Philip Marlowe finds crime as deadly in a lakeside resort as it is on the mean streets of the city of angels, and the body count mounts as the suspense builds and the plot twists. The character development is impeccable, the dialogue lively and bright and suitably sarcastic, and the plotting as convoluted as any Chandler classic would be likely to be. <br />The mountaintop setting for much of the story lends itself to some poetic prose from the sensitive tough-guy with an eye for beauty and an ear for simile. The narrative flows easily as Marlowe unwinds the mystery to it's inevitable conclusion, observing, lamenting, and condemning the corruption and injustice of the American social structure while withholding judgement from even the most vicious and violent, in his typically refreshing blend of cynicism and naivete. <br />The writing is spare and straightforward, but it's an illusion, an act of synergy, for the totality of effect is magnified beyond the sum total of the parts, proving that in literature as in art, less is more.	2001-11-06

James Wight, son of the famous &quot;James Herriot&quot;, does an admirable job of filling in the often less than idyllic real-world background for an idyllic life and phenomenal literary success, without spoiling the effect of a humble, sensitive, and rewarding life. James Herriot often averred that he was 99% vet, and 1% writer, but he was 100% human, and beloved for his warmth and concern for all creatures great and small. I thoroughly enjoyed this book as an insightful and readable account of the Yorkshire vet known the world over, and find it a fitting conclusion to the Herriot stories.  How pleasant to think that it might also be the beginning of a literary career for yet another &quot;Herriot&quot;, as James Wight's aptitude with the written word moves the account along admirably, and does his father proud.	2001-10-22

Much more than just a look at historical errors, the book is a scathing and unrelenting expose of the pernicious mythologies perpetuated in the name of history, as a subtle (and sometimes overt) means by which our collective memory is subverted and manipulated.  Loewen is at heart an idealist, who sees things as they could be, and asks &quot;why not?&quot;, an outlook that has gotten others in hot water before. His thesis seems to be that to benefit from history, we must first learn history, embrace it, and teach it, in all it's blemished and tarnished glory. As long as we continue to allow history to be distorted, revised, and altered to suit the propagandist needs of political ideologies, we build our world viewpoint on shifting sands of myth and fantasy, for which we and our future generations will pay a hefty price.  Written with wit and, at times, biting sarcasm, Loewen's book is an enjoyable and yet disturbing guidebook to American Memory Lane, a journey that, without the doses of reality his book provides, might at times resemble more a confusing ride through the hall of mirrors.  A book well worth reading, digesting, and discussing, I was sorry when it ended.	2001-10-21

True, we'd like to see more religions represented, but one has to start somewhere if one wants an understanding of religious faith in America, and this is a good place to start.  Perhaps an updated version will appear, addressing some of the faiths that have gained ascendancy in more recent years.  The real beauty of this book lies in it's approach - rather than being one person's interpretation and explanation of various religious beliefs, a representative spokesman FROM each faith explains the beliefs of that faith, and answers frequently-asked-questions ala Barbara Walters style.  The views presented then, are as each faith would like them presented - from the horse's mouth, as it were.  This eliminates a lot of error due to bias which taints so many of the books published along these lines.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning what DO other (mostly mainstream) religions believe?  What does MY religion espouse?	2001-10-04

The film, of course, is not based on this book, but on the lengthier THE KENNEDY TAPES, transcripts of secret tape recordings made by JFK and only recently made available to the public.<br />Still, the book and the film correlate nicely, and complement one another. The book is not a finished product, in that we find that RFK was assassinated before completing his work on the memoirs; we also find that he did not speak as openly as one might after the key players had left the stage - his comments reflect a certain guarded caution.<br />The edition which I read contained an introduction by Bob McNamera, which was written shortly after Bobby's assassination, and was very poignant and touching, if somewhat emotional. The book is too brief, just touching the rough outline of events and feelings as recalled by Bobby Kennedy, one of the key players himself. I gave this book 5-stars for being a valuable contribution to our understanding of events that were largely hidden from the American public at the time of their transpiring. But for a more in-depth look at the clash of ideologies and the ensuing power struggles during this crisis, one has to consult other sources. I'm well into the Kennedy Tapes book, and will review it upon completion.	2001-08-13

I've followed most of the conspiracy theories and anti-conspiracy theories pretty closely, and find it rare to encounter a study like this one, that doesn't add confusion for every point it clarifies.<br />While there is a lot of additional material worthy of reading and research, this book is a good objective overview of the assassination in in's historical context, and of the only prosecution of anyone anywhere for the crime of the century.	2001-08-04

In this enlightening and engrossing book that chronicles the life of a huge, freak storm that leads to disaster at sea, the author gives us a front-row seat to the events and circumstances that lead, inexorably, to the disasterous finale.<br />As events unfold, we come to understand and admire these men, everyday working people who regularly put their lives on the line for their paycheck. We gain an appreciation for the dangers they face at sea, we see firsthand both the beauty and the brutality of the ocean. And much more so in the book than in the movie, we see what kind of economic factors and pressures, as well as what kind of personality factors, drive these men to put themselves at risk, so that what at first appears to be reckless abandon ends up looking much more like economic necessity coupled with an absolutely unpredictable twist of nature.<br />Also included in the unfolding drama are some amazing stories of survival, rescue, and heroism. And you really get a feeling for the awesome power this incredible threefold-storm generated!<br />While some have criticized the movie for being &quot;pure fiction&quot;, the book is a different story. True, no one made it back to tell all, but there was radio contact up until the very end. And what the author does, in areas where all the facts are not known, is research other very similar situations at sea, to show what happens when a boat is in such-and-such a situation; what does the captain do, what do the crew do, what do sailors think and feel under those circumstances. Because no one made it back to tell, the author wanted to put absolutely as much information as COULD be known down as a record of this incredible event. The movie takes liberties that the book does not.<br />The book comes across as a fitting tribute to the men who died on the Adrea Gail, and the countless others who have died at sea, and who never returned to have their story told. I hope we hear more from Sebastian Junger in the future!	2001-07-20

At the heart of the writer's understated style lies a belief in the humanity of man, in the quiet strength and unspoken virtue within, that lends a certain dignity to his characters.

A fun and engrossing whodunnit in the tradition of Ray Chandler's Marlowe, or Ross Macdonald's Archer, with a bibliphile slant. Beloved by collectors who have been paying big-bucks for a 1st edition, the book is a lively noir fiction romp well worth the ride. The book is Dunning's tribute to Chandler, and he has learned from the master how to build atmosphere layer by layer, and to create tension that is palpable. Witty dialogue and 1st-person narrative, complete with introspection, ala Chandler also.  Janeway is a fearless book-loving cop who makes some rash decisions, but never strays from his own chosen vision of justice as he unravels the mystery of the murder of a local impoverished bookscout, and crosses the path of a vicious criminal who vows revenge. Overall a four-star-plus read that will send you to the sequel The Bookman's Wake, and leave you wishing for some more in the bookman Cliff Janeway series!	2001-06-25

Parker's Sequel to Raymond Chandler's the Big Sleep	Books	3	14	15	N	N	half-hearted romp through the mean streets	a little background is in order (as I understand it): the heirs of Chandler approached Parker to finish the Poodle Springs manuscript, and part of the deal was that he had to write one more Marlowe story. 'Dream' is that one more. The job was almost impossible to begin with (Chandler's drinking had taken the edge off his talent by that time, and the Poodle manuscript got off on the wrong foot to boot), the Chandler fans ripped it for not being up to Chandler's prime (which even Chandler himself wasn't, towards the end), the Parker fans ripped it for not being true Spencer, and Parker felt the strain of wearing another man's shoes. So by the time he got to this one, my guess is, his heart wasn't in it. He's said he'll never do another Marlowe book. That said, it's still good to have Marlowe back, cracking wise and cruising the mean streets again. I liked it better than Chandler's &quot;The Pencil&quot;, and better than some of the Spencer books! I just wish Parker would reconsider, and do another Marlowe book without the pressures and constraints of a contract. Marlowe, like Sherlock, is a detective who deserves to live on after his progenitor, but the return of L.A.'s hard-boiled prose-poet is, perchance, just a dream.	2001-06-23

The reason I say &quot;archaic&quot; is that the hand-held pocket calcuator has made the use of &quot;tables&quot; obsolete long ago. If you're serious about learning the almost-forgotten art of true roof-cutting, multi-hips with broken ridges, and so forth, get yourself a good little trig calculator, a used introd. trig text, and a copy of &quot;A Roof Cutter's Secrets to Framing the Custom Home&quot; by Will L.

There is a dearth of information on this complex subject, and this text is a welcome entry for that void. Unfortunately, while Mr. Gross is himself a talented roof-cutter and carpenter, he is less talented as a teacher and writer. I found his explanations lacking, although well-supported with drawings and diagrams. He introduces some very useful concepts, such as theoretical lengths and height-above-plate, and he encourages the solution to roof calculation problems by means of a trig calculator, rather than obsolete math tables. I found this book very useful, although weakly bound for the rigors of an oft-consulted text. In conjunction with Gross's book, I also recommend &quot;A Roof Cutter's Secrets to Framing the Custom Home&quot; by Will Holladay.	2001-06-23

This is a fairly dry, book-by-book account of 100 &quot;banned&quot; works of literature. Actually, &quot;restricted&quot; would be a better choice than &quot;banned&quot;, since many of the books weren't outright banned, but banished from the shelves of school libraries. So the book vacillates between books that were outright banned for the threat they represented to an existing power bloc, and books that were removed from schools for the inappropriate material they contained for schoolchildren.<br />It gives one pause for thought to realize the extent of the threat that books represent, for as has been commented, history is written by the victors. This book shows that another viewpoint with a different agenda can cause panic and animosity among the ruling elite, regardless of how factual or well-documented - and regardless of how futile it has proven to be, in the long run, to try to bury or hide the truth from the masses.<br />In another sense, this book is an examination of our own societal narrow-mindedness and fear of ideas, a malady which remains epidemic throughout the modern world. For it's fearless examination of this prevalent problem, and for it's readability, I rate it 4 stars.<br />But, as I mentioned earlier, the book does not distinguish between banning a book for it's ideology vs restricting a book for morally degenerate or offensive material, which is a horse of a different color, in my opinion. I have no problem with schools or parents striving to provide moral direction to the young, and restrict access to offensive material. To remove a book from a school library or curriculum is not to attack the book or the author, only to avoid condoning or promoting it's contents to schoolchildren, and I don't see this as being on the same level of seriousness as attempting to restrict an ideology or bury a historicaltruth. <br />Overall, a thought-provoking and informative little book, easy to read in small bites, since it's broken down book-by-book. I recommend it to parents, teachers, librarians, booksellers, civil libertarians, and literature lovers!	2001-06-23

I also mention &quot;antiquarian&quot;, which is the field this handsome little reference seems to favor, whereas there are numerous fields of collecting more egalitarian which are untouched upon. So if you're into antiquarian books, and want to learn more about the British market, this is the book for you.  An overview of the field in general it isn't.

On the surface, it's a vintage (1939) whodunnit with a wealthy geriatric patriarch, a missing Irish ex-bootlegger, a beautiful but shallow blonde with some unsavory connections to a purveyor of smut, a long-legged raven-haired beauty who seems surprisingly unconcerned about her missing Irish husband, and a series of corpses that keep littering the path to a resolution of matters.     The convoluted plot may strain credibility like a politician's campaign promises, but never mind that. The book is not about plot. It's about the details of death, the emotions of danger and the smell of fear, the corruption of power, and the power of corruption. It's about hedges trimmed as tidy as poodle-dogs, stained-glass knights in shining armor, damsels more dangerous than any alleged distress that might serve to lure a chivalrous private eye into their web of deceit. It's about a Don Quixote of the mean streets waging a private war between his own base desires and his own impossible standards. It's a guided tour of the small triumphs and victories of decency and honor and human conscience in the face of the overwhelming flood of depravity, dishonesty and degradation.     It's a fun and easy read, and while some of the slang may be dated, the symmetry of syntax and the graphic power of simile never gets stale, read after read after read. A watershed work that has inspired generations of mystery writers from Ross Macdonald to Michael Connelly, and echoes in the works and words of countless of wordsmiths of the macabre persuasion.	2001-05-22

That said, I hope you get the feeling this is not a book that everyone will love - it will wrankle some feathers because many will find their comfortable sterotypes exposed as heroic cardboard cut-outs obscuring real 3-dimensional people with egos, flaws, and ulterior motives.  It is a fascinating look at history textbook errors through the eyes of a history professor who has learned that the motives of the author or publisher may affect the content of a history book far more than historical facts. <br />The surprising part, to me, is how open the secret agenda of high-school textbook publishers really is. And this is really the crux of the matter - not the fact that Helen Keller was a socialist, or Woodrow Wilson was a white supremacist, or Columbus thought nothing of torture or genocide to accomplish his ambitions.  Of course, for textbook publishers, the profit motive is first and foremost, but related to it is this issue of building better citizens by means of propaganda which inspires loyalty. Textbook publishers seem to feel that history books are to incite young folks to fervent chauvenism, and truth and historical fact are expendable commodities in this noble quest. They openly admit that historical truth is not their objective!  To me, this admission reverberates through the entire book, through the entire grade-school curriculum, through all of our collective memories and perceptions of the foundation teachings of our youth.  <br />Another very important issue this book confronts is the school textbook's negation of the cause/effect principle in human history, the unwillingness to look for reasons for unrest or protest or reactionary violence. Textbooks present history as a one-dimensional linear march of &quot;great&quot; men who just keep making the world better and better.  The reality that is glossed over is that history is a complex series of power-shifts and reactions to a rich milieu of varied stimulants, and it is pointless to analyze an event or attitude without looking for the social/historical realities that spawned it.<br />The book is filled with fascinating revisions of those trite historical stereotypes we all grew up with, and for this, and for the author's passion for his subject matter, I rate it a 5. However, it does have some flaws worth mentioning, to wit: It is heavily slanted toward Native American revisionism, whereas it does not deal with the overall subject in a balanced spectrum, and the language is sometimes overly stiff and scholarly (keep the dictionary handy while reading this one!). <br />Like many, many others, I grew up thinking history was boring. What this book shows is that it's only the neutered, decaffeinated, lobotomized, sanitized, liposuctioned and implant-enhanced version that will bore you to tears - the dirt reality is as gripping and fascinating as Real Life with all it's warts showing, for after all, isn't that what history is REALLY made of?	2001-05-17

And all of this is delivered with a caustic sense of humor, a wry wit, and a hypersensitivity to the visual world and it's translation into the language of the mean streets. <br />Although Chandler died shortly before I was born, I grew up in L.A., and I can say that the L.A. Chandler wrote of is in many ways the city of my childhood memories, so well did he capture the ambiance and ambivalence of the 'city of angels'. <br />Some have criticized his plotting and plausability, but emotion, action, and detail were what interested him the most, and in these he excelled. FAREWELL MY LOVELY must be viewed within the context of it's era (published in 1940) to be fully appreciated, but the flow of action, the visual aspect of it's language, and the insights into the very human conflict of corruption verses conscience are timeless. <br />This book, like the first in the Marlowe series (THE BIG SLEEP) was written at the height of Chandler's creative career, and exemplifies the style that has made him a writer's writer, possibly the most imitated author of the past century.	2001-05-15

The book is too short however, and some of the letters just aren't that funny - like the sincere compliments to certain establishments for the mundane chores performed by the lower-echelon staff. I for one wish more people DID appreciate these unsung heroes, so I didn't find it humorous. And letters to hotels to see if they would accomodate some outrageous physical defect - this borders on mocking those with physical defects, so I didn't find them as funny either.  But overall, none of the flaws are in any way mean-spirited, and the humor is intense - I was crying and hyper-ventilating while trying to read these to my wife, I was laughing so hard.

The heirs of Raymond Chandler, one of the most imitated writers of all time, approached Parker, an obvious disciple of the master, to finish an incomplete manuscript the deceased author left behind. This was a tough assignment: The story was begun when Chandler was past his prime, his habitual alcohol abuse having taken it's toll on his creative powers. There was no plot to speak of, just a few initial chapters, with Chandler's writing sounding like a maudlin parody of his earlier work. Still, the talent was there, and the playfulness and wit had not died out completely, in spite of all else. And like Sherlock Holmes, Philip Marlowe is too good to let him fade away just because his initial author has passed on. So Parker had to finish someone else's novel, with someone else's style and someone else's protagonist, in another place and time that wasn't his own. And he did a remarkable job - funny, witty, and as true to the original as the first five chapters that were given him would allow. It's a period piece that re-creates the decadent world of Marlowe's California, with a nod or two to contemporary tastes for violence and sexual content. So once you understand the obstacles, you can appreciate the result even more...a fun novel that stands on it's own as a parody and as a hard-boiled romp through old L.A., and a chance to spend some time with a much-missed thick-skinned soft-hearted galahad of the golden state, after a long goodbye.	2000-12-27

The book provides an eye-opening look into the mentality and sensibility that fostered naziism, but the show was not without cost, and the author is almost drawn into the maelstrom of the self-serving dogma of fanaticism, and the insensitivity to the suffering that it produces. In the end, I found myself wondering if it was worth it - to speak firsthand with the leaders of this demented movement provided valuable historical insights - and yet, by pretending to go along with the nazi mentality in order to gain their trust, the author both allows them another venue to promote their caustic dogma, and finds himself befriending some of the most reprehensible emenies of human brotherhood, peace, and dignity - all the while claiming to abhor their agenda while admiring their &quot;courage&quot;. The author manifested great personal courage also, if courage means to risk personal danger in the commitment to a cause. But what of moral courage? Brandenburg's quest for truth is rooted in moral courage, and might parallel the courage it truth for many americans to question the warren commission, and look long and hard at the facts supporting a high-level govenment conspiracy and coup. Yet, somehow the moral issues got derailed along the way, although the final act, of actually publishing the book, seems to be in defiance to the tangent, a final-ditch effort at absolution for compromises along the way. The book raises some deep and disturbing issues, while itself being content to deal with the more superficial aspects of the nazi regime. Definitely worth reading, if for nothing other than the human touch of gritty reality that it lends to an almost abstract historical era.	2000-12-23

But here, the author takes a lighthearted but very personal look at the impact of books, and reading, on her life. She probes the question that is seldom addressed - just what impact does reading actually have? Is reading living, or just the written record of living? If we read and then forget, how has what we're read impacted us? Does reading make us a better person? Or even a different person? While everyone will have their own answers to these questions, I enjoyed the author's unstructured reminiscences and ruminations, appreciative that she would share this portion of herself with other booklovers who also ponder these abstracts. One thinks of Louis L'amour's rambling biography, for while these two authors are world's apart in personality &amp; perspective, both are confirmed, card-carrying bookaholics, just sharing their love of and commitment to the written word.	2000-12-22
