Bill Maher is definitely a ranter, and let me tell you that's what this book is about, because it's formatted that way of course!  Sorry, his sarcasm is getting to me, and maybe it should, because I found the book rather funny.    Sure, you don't have to agree with all the jokes (and if you do then you're probably Bill Maher).  Instead, look at each joke individually, because if lambasting Bush over the missing WMD's is too much for you, then wait because the democrats will take the hit next.  Or do you fit one of the jokes too well and feel hurt?  Well, don't worry.  Oh he meant it, but he means a lot of things and that is half the humor.    The only real complaint I have is that this seems more appropriate for the audio format, because these are brief frustrated vocal musings and should be treated as such (he does have an unabridged audio format with him speaking.)  Plus, when you tell that many jokes, or \\"new rules\\", then you know some won't be funny.  Sometimes he even points that out.	2005-07-27

Three excellent qualities that help reach us as the readers, and then simultaneously show us our reality.  That reality is that corporations are running America. <br /> <br />Yes, we have our doubts, but honestly Hightower sets up this scary truth quite well.  For example, who did you think was more similar Bush/Gore/Kerry.  Sure they have their differences, but maybe Nader isn't as crazy as he seems in blurring them together.  Luckily, as Hightower shows us there is also hope, but I don't want to ruin the book for you by sharing all of the anecdotes.  Nope, I'm mostly above that. <br /> <br />So instead just realize what's happening today in our world.  I mean if you're a liberal then you've even heard conservatives complaining about the same kind of stuff (although these are traditionally the middle-to-lower class conservatives.)  And conservatives, you know you've heard liberals address these issues many times.   So I think this portrays a common and urgent message of self-realization, which Hightower highlights for us quite well.   <br /> <br />It's time to take our country back.	2005-07-27

I heard about this book quite some time ago and never really got around to it recently.  Now that I have though I say I'm quite for the better.  Sure there were challenges, such as reading through the lengthy raves of the characters, a few in particular might I add, but overall the novel was still much a pleasure.<br /><br />The plot goes a bit like this.  There are three brothers, all with the last name Karamazov, and they've been separated for a few years as they have edged into their adult life.  Each following their own paths, whether that be of a priest or a sinner or neither, and all ending up back at their house with their father.  Then their relationships with each other and many others develops into a fair number of assorted, yet connected, subplots, in a style I find reminiscent almost of Alexandre Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo.<br /><br />Aside from being a classic, particularly in Russian literature where it is much more approachable then Tolstoy's War and Peace, the novel was indeed entertaining, and at points even quite intriguing.  The amount of culture one learns and history just from following this fictional family is quite astounding, and I greatly appreciated it.<br /><br />So those who shun length of any sort stay away, because the book itself is decently long and as I mentioned Dostoevsky likes to include lengthy narration parts too, including those of the \\"narrator.\\"  But those who like a challenge, literature, or just a complex but good story then Karamazov may just be waiting for you.	2005-07-27

My political persuasion is, more often then not, about as far (leftward) from O'Reilly's as it could be, yet I was surprised, for better or worse, about the quality of this book.  Now you see three stars and you probably do not think quality, but considering what he normally is on his TV show I think three is an excellent start.    On television, he has become the pinnacle of the right-wing network that is Fox.  There he will rage on and on about not just the left, but anything slightly out-there.  Yet, as opposed to Ann Coulter who writes like she speaks (not good in her case), O'Reilly seems to be reaching out to a more common grounded middleman with this book.    Yes, in my opinion he still has a lot of \\"off\\" ideas; however, he differs with me on the conclusions and I found myself often agreeing on the problems.    For instance, O'Reilly would like to have religion in public schools (or at least be more allowed), and while I agree with the right to practice the religion of your choice and I see the good out of following a moral-based religion, I disagree with the position that schools and religion should mix.  Still though this much agreement may be amazing, and admittedly I have often been called slightly conservative (maybe just stubborn) by my liberal friends.  In addition, I have to also accept that perhaps part of this is the moderate political tracings of Bill O'Reilly.    For O'Reilly, if I remember correctly, was one of the few conservatives who ever openly spoke about being tricked by Bush over the WMD's, and to me that shows progress/openness.    Now, I can't imagine how this author is the same as the TV host (although of course he is), who goes off angrily on television from topic to topic, mouthing off his interviewees, and just plain sounding pretty dumb, but somehow it is.    So overall, I cannot say if I recommend this book or not, but I can say at least there is middle ground to be found.	2005-07-26

Sewanee, T.N. is currently known for the school there by the same name (or a.k.a. University of the South).  However, when Ely Green, the subject and author, was growing up in the early 1900's, his little town of Sewanee was everything to him, and not just the school but the people too, and more.  Even in the tumultuous times Ely clinged to this idea of a beautiful sanctuary, but being black in a small southern town was still no picnic, even in this quasi-oasis of Sewanee. <br /> <br />Ely, in a distinct (and mostly accurate) format tells of his life from his birth till his early twenties.  He tells of how he was born of an anonymous white man, a local noble of Sewanee, and his black mother, whom died when Ely was young.  Ely also tells how this mixed-heritage placed him in a quandary where the other African American distanced themselves from him, while the wealthy whites for the most part appreciated him.  And Ely also tells how isolation seemed to come like the tides. <br /> <br />But that is merely a small part of Ely's past as he describes in much more detail his unusual life and that of his favorite town and estranged mother, Sewanee.  Because few have ever had a life like Ely, and until this book few would of ever known of one such as Ely's either.	2005-07-26

Up to, and still a bit since the September 11th attacks most Americans have always considered terrorists to be far away.  But Emerson paints a more disturbing picture, where terrorists over seas, and mostly 'imported' terrorists at collaborate, openly and often. <br /> <br />Because that is the beauty of our system, with free speech especially, but also the right to congregate.  Yet Emerson points out that these sacred liberties are being used against us, and throughout the book he demonstrates how. <br /> <br />I personally found this book to be rather insightful, if not a little, okay very, unnerving.  The ideas for the most part have crossed my mind before, but then again Emerson was researching this from the late 80's on, and for the most part information has only come out when attacks occur. <br /> <br />So this book is almost to keep us watchful.  Yes the release, or perhaps re-release, is also timed with recent terrorist incidents, mostly the few years post-9/11, but we should be keen to this knowledge always. <br /> <br />And remember, Emerson is not trying, I believe, to be hateful or even spiteful, for he is merely focused on one aspect, the Islamic fundamentalist side, of the overall treacherous world that is terrorism.	2005-07-13

Shane is the story of a kid named Bob Starret and his family, and Shane, and how that connection there helped changed everyone in their town's lives.   <br /> <br />The Starretts and the other local farmers had claimed their stakes of land, as the government deemed proper, but free-ranger Fletcher is losing his because of their 'squatting' and has been trying to get it back.  Then, Shane enters, a mysterious old-gunman who has ended his shooting days, only to become stuck in the middle of this ensuing property battle that could bring him back to the steel. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the book as a whole is not that bad, and thus I understand why some English teachers have their students read it.  However, this is also not a fine piece of literature, as some make it out to be.  Too much emphasis is put on Shane being almost a deity, with everything happening because of course, he is Shane.  And the whole time I was reading this book, I felt that the over-use of description was merely compensating for the true, and often apparent lack of story. <br /> <br />In the end, I believe the message gets across, but if you're looking for some good westerns, maybe not as heartfelt, then I'd recommend any of Louis Lamours books.  Because when it comes to a story, Shane has the potential for emotion and excellent plot, only to fall short.	2005-07-08

Yet this book is more then just a book of Crusoe survival.  In fact, this could be Golding's sociological view of youth when tested.  Of course, this is solely fiction.<br /><br />Either way though, this story of cohesion and division can touch one, but then it can also frighten.  Now whether that skill is attributed to the plot or Golding's writing is debatable, although it's probably both.<br /><br />Like I said though, this is a classic for all, espesically the middle-schooler.	2005-03-24

He decrees that he shall no longer be burdened by intelligence, critical analysis, or culture.  Instead, he wants to be stupid.      Now, this may seem like an idiotic thought, but to Antoine it makes sense because his attempts at becoming an alcoholic failed, after only a half-glass, and his suicide instructor accidentally led him away from the morbid path.  Go figure.      Overall, this book is a glimpse, as one reviewer put it, into Antoine's \\"wonderful existential journey.\\"  Not too deep mind you, and that is one of the main faults.  This book, sensibly enough, is especially alluring to the reader who finds that he or she relates to Antoine - pre-stupidity attempts.  In this sense we feel his pain, and see a tidbit of ourselves.  However, as previously mentioned, this book is short and does not offer us the expanded view, into either ourselves or existentialism in general, that we might have wanted.      (Also especially poignant for the Huckabees fan)	2005-03-08

Richard Condon's extraordinary novel about political upheavals, assassinations, and Communist meddling is probably one of the best politically based fiction books ever. <br /> <br />The story is about a man named Raymond and how, for political gain, he is mind washed into becoming a top political assassin.   <br /> <br />That is mere formality, for this story is already well known.  Now, this story is more known for the movie versions, original and re-make; however, as is often the case the book is even grander then the films. <br /> <br />I was enchanted by this story, as it still has at least some cultural relevance, (especially for those who lived during the assassinations of JFK and his brother RFK.)   <br /> <br />In short, Condon directs us to look at more then just the crazy political system, but the whole wacky world.  Thus, this is why the book is such a classic, and deserves and should be read by all.	2005-01-29

Robert Draper's Rolling Stone Magazine: The Uncensored Story is a stunning testament to the magazine which helped herald in an era, and has been here ever since.  This book isn't about the artists that were covered; instead it's more about the staff, the writers, th editors, and especially founder Jann Wenner, almost biographically so.<br /><br />Now out of the 60's came many things good and bad but in the late 60's Rolling Stone the magazine was formed.  However it's never that simple and Draper conveys that well.  With inside information due to hundreds of interviews and just some good research he pieces together what life was like behind the cover.<br /><br />My only fault is that I wish this book could have been written in 2004 instead of 1990 so that I could learn about recent events.  Overall this is a great book and I highly recommend it for musicians, journalists, and any Rolling Stone magazine avid fans out there.	2004-12-14

I personally loved Watership Down so that is naturally why I picked up this book.  However, it was disappointingly less new storyline than I expected.  In fact the first half of the book was just the rabbits telling more adventures of El Ahrairah.  Now this was not boring, yet I expected another great adventure or at least a series of adventures about Fiver, Hazel, and the others.  I still recommend it to those who truly liked the first book, but do not expect the same rush that you got from the first book.	2004-04-18

Cory, a young kid growing up like you did or are doing, is just enjoying life until one day when his father witnesses a brutal murder.  Now, Cory is still enjoying life but the whole rest of the book is wrapped with the murderous thought lurking in the background.  Now do not be depressed either because the book is one of life, in general, its joys and its sorrows.  On another note I thought the beginning was a bit slow; however, once you get into the book and &quot;know&quot; Cory you should find it a very entertaining tale, all about that magical time called childhood.	2004-04-05

In this book Nylund is bridging the gap between Master Chief's defeat of the Covenant on Halo itself and the return to Earth that is Halo II.  This book is not just about picking up fallen remnants of what happened previously, but it also takes new twists of its own.  Other than the fact that this is a Halo book, it is just also a good little story to read and I recommended it.  Oh, and don't forget to read the other two first.	2004-04-05

First Meetings is the perfect book for a simple introduction into Ender's world, so why not start there.  This book, like his other Ender books, is just amazingly well written.  For example, OSC presents a semi-futuristic world, yet we can all relate and just enjoy reading about the characters; that is not an easy task.  It does help that this book is more than just a book. It is really a collection of his Ender short stories, including the one that started it all.  For any Ender fan, this is an obvious book to add to the collection, but for the casual reader it presents stories about child geniuses, space wars, and even family.  It is a very enjoyable book, and if you like this, and I think you will, then you should definitely read the series.	2003-08-20

However, with his great writing skills and able storytelling, he keeps the reader's rapt attention.  This book does not have to introduce any major new character from the beginning, so the action just runs throughout the whole story and takes you right along with it.  I was amazed at the connection that I felt with the characters, but especially near the last moments of the book.  I really love books when I feel I can relate to them, and this book has something for everyone to connect to.  It is one, if not the best ending book of a trilogy, I am pretty sure he is not writing another, that I know of.  I highly recommend this whole series.  However, if you have read the second I can only say this.  Read on, read on.	2003-07-16

Not in the sense of the story, because there are plenty of great new adventures with some great character development, including a key new character.

I probably did not appreciate it as much as I should have if I understood it better.  However, the exact same thing happened with the fifth book.  Harry starts so much more emotionally darker than before, that I was just caught off guard at his mood change.  Some say teenage angst, but also he does have a lot more to deal with, I mean considering Voldemort's return and the standardized tests that helps decide a large part of his future.  In addition, with so many more pages, Harry's personality is delved into deeper and deeper, especially in his relationships with his friends, his godfather Sirius, and his crush, Cho.  All this made for a busy book, but I felt it was so different then before, that I was kind of overwhelmed.  Overall I did like it, but it just was not, in my humble opinion, as great as the first three.	2003-07-07

Also, how many ranchers are not making enough money to support their families because meat companies are controlling the prices.  These are the kind of questions presented and answered in this book. Fast Food Nation, The Jungle of our times, shows how food safety and food health issues are still current issues in this powerful cosmopolitan world of ours.  I recommend this to any fast food consumer, not to make them quit eating fast food, unless you want to, but to become more aware of what goes on in the world, especially on the home front, wherever that may be.	2003-07-07

This book covers most of the life of a few unique individuals, the Master Chief and his fellow Spartans.  This book follows much of the development of the Spartan program and the fight against the Covenant.  Yes, this is the book where you meet such characters as Cortana and Keyes, but you meet others such as Dr. Halsey, the founder of the Spartan program.  This book covers much of what the normal Halo player does not know and it gives great insight into the life of the Master Chief, the character you are in the Halo game.  This is just a great book.  Although I preferred the Halo book I think this is right about there with it.  So read this one first to get the intro, then read the book and if you haven't played the game already, do that.  Even if you're not a Halo fan now, you probably will be, or you'll just enjoy this as being a good sci-fi action book.	2003-05-16

It is the same story with a lot, if not all, of the game's dialogue in the book.  But that is not all of the dialogue for it goes much deeper; in fact, you even get to see the action play out from the Covenant perspective, and, yes, even a flood perspective.  These different views allow you to get a much broader grasp of the overall operations including what the soldiers are doing without the Master Chief, the Xbox game's main character.  Speaking of the Master Chief, you get a lot more insight into his character and the history of the SPARTANS of which he is one.  For those of you who know the game, be prepared to see it in a well told new light, for those of you who don't, you need to buy this good quick sci-fi action book for the story alone.	2003-05-10

This has never been truer nor better done than in his book Band of Brothers.  This book is not about all the allies, nor is it even about all the American soldiers; instead, it is about one rifle company, Easy Company, doing what had to be done.  Ambrose does not paint pretty pictures about their heroisms; he just tells their story and lets their actions speak for themselves.  In fact, Ambrose does such a great job at this that I felt personally involved, which is something that history books usually discourage.  As you read about Easy Company from their training to their final action at Hitler's Eagle's Nest you cannot help but be awed by their actions and wonder if you, in the same position, would be able to do the same thing.  This great book tells more about the soldiers themselves than the numbers of kills they got.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, even if you have little interest of World War II.	2003-03-19

After his talk, I decided to read the book for myself.  At first, I noticed that the authors took a lot of time to research the subject thoroughly, so much so that I think they know more about Chattanooga than I do, keeping in mind Leroy Phillips does live here.  What also impressed me the most was the nonfiction story itself.  The story is about a black man named Ed Johnson who was put on trial at first as a scapegoat.  However, he eventually was a target for all anti-black aggressions.  I mean, for me the 60's were scary, but the brutality and violence of the early 1900's, especially these incidents, are just terrifying.  This book will show a detailed look at Chattanooga's past; it will show some historically fascinating law and court decisions, and it will just be an amazing read.	2003-03-09

Germ attacks have become a major issue, yet many people do not know even the slightest information about biological warfare.  This book helped fill me in on a broad view of the biological program, but at the same time it went extremely in depth and discussed essential specifics that helped me get the in-depth grasp that I needed to better comprehend biological warefare.  I thought that the newsy approach and style were great, because, although it is a fact-filled book, they keep the reader coming back for more.  With the authors many different angles, their journalistic approach, and just the relevance of the topic, I believe that this book is a must read for anyone who wants to keep up with current happenings about biological warefare or just learn a little about recent history.	2003-02-19

This book is just as great as his D-Day one and for all the same reasons.  Ambrose's use of detail, much of it received from oral interviews, never bores but thoroughly enhances the read.  So pick it up and learn how that famous chapter of U.S. history came to a close.	2003-01-25

This may or may not be a good thing.  One main difference is that in The Victors the book goes chronologically like the others; however, The Victors is not focused on the timeline of events.  For example there is a section for each of the two American landing beaches at D-Day, and then there is a section for Hedgerows; neither of the sections are certain dates or times.  I personally love reading WWII books so I do not believe that the repetitions are superfluous, as other casual readers may.  In my opinion, it is a very well-written and truly great book.	2003-01-25

To me, war is one of the most intriguing aspects of human society.  Enter, Stephen E. Ambrose's D-Day book.  If you are looking for a real good book about one of the most pivotal points in history, then I doubt you could find much better.  Ambrose takes you everywhere, from the generals to the privates, from the offices to the beaches.  He does it very factually, while still keeping it interesting.  You can learn so much about D-Day from this book and still just love it for the read.  It is a truly terrific book.	2003-01-25

Joseph Campbell takes an in-depth view of mythology and claims that it is really just composed of products of the subconscious.  He backs his claim up with many stories from such well known religious stories such as the bet about Job to myths told by the Eskimos.  You do not have to believe what he is telling you, but his points are very intriguing ones to think about.  This is some pretty heavy stuff, definitely not meant for a light read, but if you have a basic idea of Freud then you will be able to take that knowledge and expand it into the realm of mythology quite easily.  You may yet discover that there is still new and intriguing stuff to learn about.	2003-01-19

I didn't until I got this book.  Instead of L'Amour's regular 19th century American west, it is now 12th century Europe and Asia.  A slight change? I think so, but one for the better.<BR> The book follows the heroic Kerbouchard as he works for vengeance, love, and, unlike most heroes, knowledge.  He is not that much different than L'Amour's western heroes.  In fact, the book is just as good as his shorter westerns and maybe even more filling, since he does use a couple hundred more pages.  And although it is not a traditional one of his, it is definitely one of his best.	2003-01-19

What starts out as an eloquent yet simple tale about Howard Roark the striving architect becomes a struggle to maintain man's individualism.  The true hero of this novel is egotism, while selflessness, as surprising as it might seem, is the evil.  This is easily one of the greatest, most profound, books I have ever read.  By the end of this book you will be thinking really deeply about your personal ideals and societies.  Sure, it is not short but it is definitely worth the length!	2003-01-17

I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project. But anyway, this is a truly great book.	2002-08-24

At first I was thinking maybe the same thing that you are, a book about a dictionary, how incredibly boring. But it really is quite interesting. I had never heard of the Oxford English Dictionary and therefore knew nothing about there being a story behind it or that the story of it's making is so fascinating. It is not all about the dictionary but more about the two main forces, two people, that helped create this book. I like this approach a lot because this way you don't get bogged down in the book, which nobody wants. At least try it, it's a suprisingly intriguing book.	2002-08-21
US	47260821	R3EWDOAE56WD7F	0375707972	153296191	The Reader	Books	2	0	1	N	N	and the connection is?	First of all, I never found any connection between the part of the book where Hanna and Michael are having a deeply sexual relationship and the part where she is on trial. I know that Michael ties it together with illiteracy, but to me that seems weak. I also didn't understand Michael's having an obsession with Hanna, which was not always sexual, for all those years. At the end something did seem to be showing a deeper message but I don't understand it still. The language kind of confused me, but it's really not that difficult. I don't know, see if you can understand this book or just enjoy it.	2002-08-21
