Hadamard was not only a brilliant mathematician, but a stimulating mentor, a man of wide-ranging knowledge, insatiable curiosity, humility, and most of all, great humanity. When Japan  invaded Manchuria, he proposed that the League of Nations send  peace-keeping forces there, only to face ridicule from the French press.  Hadamard, more than most of us, deeply felt the tragic wastefulness of war.  He lost two beloved sons in World War I. Of his son, Etienne, he once said:  &quot;what I did in mathematics is nothing compared to what he could do if  he were alive today.&quot; (Half of the brilliant graduates of the Ecole  Normale were killed in that war). I finished this book with feelings of  gratitude and regret--gratitude to Hadamard for sharing his remarkable  gifts with such generosity, and deep regret that &quot;fate&quot; was so  grievously unfair to him.	2000-04-29

But more than the character sketches of great scientific minds like Szilard and  Monod, I appreciated two startling stories in particular, one of which is  told in more fascinating detail than I'd encountered before, and the other,  which is shocking and, if true, deserving of wider publicity. The first  story details the work of Nobel prize-winning chemist Fritz Haber, whose  synthesis of ammonia enabled Germany to sustain its military effort in WWI.  Haber, a gentle man of tremendous culture and erudition, was also  ambitious. Perutz describes in more detail than is readily available  elsewhere Haber's efforts to sustain chemical warfare experiments after the  war under the guise of agricultural research. Tragically, he supervised the  development of Zyklon B, a deadly gas that would later be used to  exterminate millions of people of Jewish descent, including some of Haber's  own relatives. Fortunately for him, Haber died in exile before learning the  full extent, and horror, of his folly. More startling to me was the story  of Albert Schatz who, Perutz contends, is the real discoverer of  streptomycin. Schatz, writes Perutz, &quot;was the son of poor Jewish  farmers in Connecticut and had studied soil microbiology to find ways of  increasing the yields on his father's unproductive farm. He embarked on the  search for antibiotics only because Waksman made it a condition of his  meager offer of $40 a month to work in his laboratory; but then Schatz  threw himself into the research, testing hundreds of different soil  micro-organisms for antibacterial activity.&quot; Perutz claims that Schatz  displayed all the initiative and effort warranted for a Nobel Prize, and  that Waksman did nothing more than sit in his office while the experiments  were going on. Later, claims Perutz, Waksman denied Schatz the recognition  he so richly deserved. Unless I missed something, I wonder why Perutz is  telling us this only now? Wouldn't it have been better for this information  to have been revealed when Waksman was alive to defend himself? And can we  expect forthcoming reference books to take note and set the record  straight?	2000-04-06

What a pity. Author Ake Daun shows that such studies, intelligently handled, can provide a  wealth of reliable insights into other cultures. Covering everything from  child-rearing to academia, he sheds considerable insight into Swedish  culture and answers, in the process, some worthwhile questions. Why, for  example, is Swedish society, on the whole, so dull? Students interested in  the cultural components of creativity will do well to take note of the  Swedish distaste for novelty, the predilection for order, peace,  literalmindedness, and the surprising salience of envy.	2000-04-05

Compared with the other Jews of Islam, whose experience of persecution was generally milder  than that of their European brethren, Yemenite Jewry often fell prey to  religious fanaticism, suffering the most grievous oppression, humiliation  and social disruption. As a result, particularly since the seventeenth  century, Talmudic study fell out of favor, while mysticism gained  popularity. In other works, I had read that Yemenite Jewish parenting was  more punitive than that of many other Jewish communities, and that  alcoholism was rife. After reading this fine but harrowing history, I think  I understand why.	2000-04-01

Peter Pulzer's chapter on the role of Jews in drafting many of Germany's  legal codes is interesting, as is Steven Lowenstein's chapter on Jewish  participation in German culture. Personally, however, I believe  Lowenstein's attribution of Jewish intellectual and cultural efflorescence  during this period to their marginal status in German society, while valid,  underrates the important strands of continuity between religious and  secular forms of socialization among Jews.	2000-04-01

Make no mistake  about it. Behind the academic facade and feigned detachment is a polemical  tract by a professor who perceives himself and other non-Jewish Caucasians  as embattled and ultimately doomed to second-class status by Jewish and  East Asian &quot;eggheads&quot;-- unless defensive measures are taken.  Think I exaggerate? How I wish that were so. MacDonald writes: &quot;The  war goes on but it is easy to see who is losing&quot;... &quot;If present  trends continue, in the long run the United States will be dominated by an  Asian technocratic elite and a Jewish business, professional and media  elite.&quot; He even perceives the &quot;increased vulnerability of  democratic and republican political institutions.&quot; Then, under the  guise of prediction informed by social identity research, MacDonald  (sounding chillingly like Louis Farrakhan) advances what is clearly his  fervent wish: that &quot;the European-derived peoples of the United States  will become increasingly unified&quot;, and that they will &quot;develop a  united front and a collectivist political orientation vis-a-vis the other  ethnic groups. Other groups will be expelled if possible or partitions will  be created, and Western societies will undergo another period of  medievalism.&quot; Ultimately, MacDonald (now sounding a bit more like the  jaded aristocracy of 19th-century Victorian America) dreams of the downfall  of the liberal individualist legacy of the enlightenment based on natural  rights, superceded by 1) &quot;the republican ideal of a cohesive, socially  homogeneous society&quot; [founded on what he calls &quot;hierarchic  harmony&quot;] and 2) the 'ethnocultural' strand emphasizing the importance  of Anglo-Saxon ethnicity in the development and preservation of American  cultural forms.&quot; Readers who are not offended by the barely concealed  malevolence of MacDonald's prose (not to mention his most tenuous grasp of  Jewish history and culture) will no doubt counsel others to keep a cool  head. (Rather like insulting someone's mother and then telling him not to  get his hackles up.) But for the rest of us, the quality of MacDonald's  scholarly rigor can be gauged from such gems as: &quot;intense hatred of  perceived enemies appears to be an important psychological characteristic  of Jews.&quot; Remarks like these should not be dignified with a response,  but I will anyway. Although two-thirds of the Jews of Europe were  exterminated by Hitler, Jews after the war sought neither violent  retaliation nor  vindictive punishment of Germany and others. And I wonder  what it was, other than &quot;intense hatred of perceived enemies&quot;,  that motivated Nazis and their sympathizers to take some two million live  Jewish children and gas them; pour acid on them; slowly starve them to  death in locked, decoupled train cars; hack them to death with meat  cleavers; and murder them in countless other unimaginable ways. Whatever  the case, the unpardonable brutalities of the past did not prevent my  Jewish father (who lost all his Polish relatives) from marrying my German  Gentile mother, nor me from loving and visiting my German relatives. So  much for intense hatred. Believer as I am in the &quot;decadent&quot;  values of liberal individualism (including free speech),I am satisfied that  MacDonald found a publisher for his labors.

The implications of the perspectives advanced here have great value not only for people interested in the ancient world, but for anyone  seeking a deeper understanding of Judaism, or even &quot;Jewishness&quot;,  today. The author depicts Rabbinic thought, as compared to ancient Greek,  as indeterminate and contingent, paradoxical, and tolerant of ambiguity.  Greek thought, of course, introduced rationalism: natural laws,  unquestioned principles, and self-evident proofs. In this fascinating  study, we can (ala Matthew Arnold) trace the roots of modern thought to  both Greece and &quot;Judea&quot; (properly speaking, Babylonia). From  Greece, rational thought; from Judea, a surprisingly modern &quot;openness  to hypothesis, to all aspects of a problem&quot;, &quot;a relativization of  generalization and conclusion&quot; and &quot;a search for alternative  explanations,&quot; habits of thought that are integral to the practice of  all natural and social sciences today.	2000-03-31

It was only after he decided to establish an empire in Africa that he began to pay attention to racial &quot;problems&quot;. One of the first racist acts of the fascist government was the warning, in October 1935, against intermarriage with Africans. Michaelis concludes: &quot;That Italian Fascism arrived at some sort of racial doctrine independently of German influence is perfectly true; for the ban on miscegenation in Africa was decreed before the birth of the Axis. It is equally true, however, that this doctrine did not take on an anti-Jewish character until Italy became a pawn of the Reich.&quot; Although we should be careful not to overgeneralize from this study, it seems clear that in the Italian case, at least, anti-semitism was more the product of calculation than fervent hatred.

Actually, if anything, the sudden flash of &quot;aha&quot; he describes in satori appears to have relatively little in common with the Western experience, and much more in common with the Buddhist. &quot;Aha&quot; in the Western sense represents sudden insights built upon a process of inquiry, interpretation, and a multifaceted search for meaning. Satori, as Torrance describes it, is associated instead with a process of developing competence and mastery, and has seemingly little to do with a search for novel or unfamiliar insights.  Satori may be a fascinating experience worthy of further study, but Torrance fails to convince me that it has any bearing on current research into creativity, or that it sheds any promising new light on the subject.	2000-03-31

Of the book's many virtues, the one I appreciate most  is the justice it does to the extraordinary role of German-Jewish women in  the development of social welfare and women's rights organizations in  pre-1933 Germany. After I read this treasure, I reflected on another book I  read entitled Great Jewish Women; unforgivably it profiled Goldie Hawn and  Ann Landers but had nary a mention of truly towering figures like Alice  Salomon, the founder of modern social work in Germany, and &quot;Soup  Kitchen Lina&quot; Morgenstern, whose herculean, selfless and pioneering  efforts on behalf of veterans, children and women were all the more  admirable given the anti-Semitism of the times. Kaplan's book provides a  sorely needed perspective on what really astonishing achievements are all  about.	2000-03-29

Hadamard was not only a brilliant mathematician, but a stimulating mentor, a man of wide-ranging knowledge,  insatiable curiosity, humility, and most of all, great humanity. When Japan  invaded Manchuria, he proposed that the League of Nations send peacekeeping  forces there, only to face ridicule from the French press. Hadamard, more  than most of us, deeply felt the tragic wastefulness of war. He lost two  beloved sons in World War I. Of his son Etienne, he once said: &quot;what I  did in mathematics is nothing compared with what he could do if he were  alive today.&quot;(As the book points out, half the brilliant graduates of  the Ecole Normale were killed in that war). I finished this book with  feelings of gratitude and regret--gratitude to Hadamard for sharing his  remarkable gifts with such generosity, and deep regret that  &quot;fate&quot; was so grievously unfair to him.	2000-03-29

Interdisciplinary studies are exciting because they hold the promise of radically new insights into familiar subjects. This book lives up to this promise in every way; in fact, it ranks as one of the most  thought-provoking and enlightening books I have read in years. Applying  anthropology to the historical study of Judaism, the author argues  persuasively that circumcision among the ancient Israelites, as indeed  among many other people, originated as a symbol of kinship and as a means  of cementing solidarity between father and son and all male cohorts. Only  later, as Judaism evolved in the directing of ethicizing and historicizing  all human experience, did the circumcision rite become invested with  distinctively Judaic religious significance. Many other provocative  insights await readers of this book. Admittedly, anthropological studies  into worlds now vanished can rarely provide conclusive evidence for their  theses. Still, this author's approach deserves serious attention from  anthropologists, historians, and the general public.	2000-03-29

With all the naivete of Don Quixote tilting at windmills, much of  the German democratic press placed an inordinate faith in the power of free  speech to make Germany a more open and just society. Unfortunately, as the  author ably argues, most miscalculated the impact that so much economic and  political disorientation would have on the country's fledgling democratic  institutions. This book deserves a wide readership.	2000-03-29

In the ongoing dispute over how much Hellenistic thought and society influenced Talmudic Judaism, this is yet another contribution from the side that lends weight to Hellenistic influence. Shavit acknowledges that the  Talmud was not quick to adopt Greek words and mythological motifs, but  argues that the influence of Greece and Rome were considerable nonetheless.  The main task of the Talmudic sages was to reinterpret the Torah in light  of changing social and economic conditions, conditions that were powerfully  influenced by Greece and Rome. Shavit's contribution will not settle the  dispute, but his is a useful addition to the burgeoning literature on the  subject.	2000-03-29

More than any other person, Alinsky was dedicated to empowering others and is  rightly credited as the founding father of community self-help. In this  highly readable account, we come to appreciate Alinsky's empathic genius  and his flair for showmanship. He had an uncanny personal gift for  discerning which acts of protest would get attention and results, as well  as an ability to teach others some of the tricks of the trade. Of all the  anecdotes in the book, perhaps the most memorable concerns the time that  young Alinsky was hauled before his rabbi for socking a kid who had beat up  his own best friend. Alinsky excuses his behavior as &quot;eye for an  eye&quot; and part of the &quot;American way.&quot; His rabbi's response is  memorable. &quot;You think you're a man because you do what everybody does.  Now I want to tell you something the great Rabbi Hillel said: 'Where there  are no men, be thou a man.' I want you to remember that.'&quot; And Alinsky  did.	2000-03-29

Harburg's gifts were uniquely  his, but this book shows us how his (financially, but not spiritually)  impoverished father cultivated Harburg's talents by taking him regularly to  the Yiddish theater on the Lower East Side and reading funny stories to him  in the evening. Harburg's insights into the elements of creative writing--  a sense of passion, an eye for paradox, an intelligent plan, e.t.c.-- are  recounted in loving detail.

It's what it  leaves out that troubles me and troubles me greatly. Historian Peter  Fritzsche maintains that the Nazis prevailed in 1933 not because the German  people embraced authoritarianism, militarism, and nationalism (as other  right-wing parties did) but because they offered them something the other  political parties did not: a &quot;refreshingly moral vision of the  nation&quot;, and &quot;a political movement that was unabashedly  nationalist, forward-looking, and socially inclusive, that recognized the  populist claims of constituents without redividing them on the basis of  occupation.&quot; World War I, says Fritzsche, accelerated the populist  yearnings of the German public for political enfranchisement and national  solidarity as exemplified, for example, in America's July 4th celebrations.  That this yearning was ultimately satisfied by a Hitler rather than a  German version of Jefferson requires quite a bit more explaining, however,  than we get from this book.             Weimar politics, like Tennyson's  depiction of Nature, was &quot;red in tooth and claw&quot;, full of the  rhetoric of ressentiment, humiliation, militancy, spite, and political  paranoia-- but don't expect to find any of that here. In this sanitized  rendering of events, we learn nothing about the pre-1933 collaboration of  the right-wing police and army with the Nazis, how this collaboration  intimidated the public, and finally, utterly desensitized them to brutal  conduct and brutal speech. Or how the Social Democratic leadership's own  decency and naive faith in the German public led them to discourage  youthful supporters from standing up to Nazi intimidation in the streets.       As for the social reform and political participation that Germans  hungered after, nowheredoes Fritzsche acknowledge that it was the liberal  Germans, disproportionately Jewish, and not the right-wing, who were  actually doing something-- a great deal, in fact-- to transform German  society in this direction. As early as the 1860s, a German complained in  the press, &quot;Why is it necessary that a Jewish woman [Lina Morgenstern]  has to manage the soup kitchens: why can't Germans do that; does everything  have to be left to the Jews?&quot; But, in fact, reformist causes remained  the preserve of liberal Germans in the Weimar period as well. Liberals  drafted labor legislation and implemented reforms in the realms of law,  social welfare and education. If the right wing, and most of the German  public, felt themselves unmoved, and uninterested in participating in these  developments, we must ask why. Fritzsche, who I hasten to add is no  apologist for the Nazis, fails to explain why Germans condoned and even  supported the vile expressions of Nazi antipathy toward Jews and liberals;  nor does he offer a convincing explanation of why they were drawn to Nazi  &quot;idealism&quot;; his portrait of Nazis as savvy local politicos and  grass-roots organizers is short on substance and ultimately unpersuasive.  Until 1933, the Nazi's concrete-- as opposed to rhetorical--  accomplishments amounted to little more than organized hooliganism and  grandiose spectacle.	2000-03-28

It affords an unflinching and incisive look at the nature of Japanese democracy by a Japanese scholar  who pulls no punches. While quite a few Western scholars have characterized  the Japanese elementary school classroom, for example, as less  authoritarian than its American counterpart, Sugimoto contends that  authoritarianism is pronounced but subtly pervasive throughout Japanese  society. Instead of accentuating top-down coercion by authorities, as  Korean and Chinese societies do, Japanese authoritarianism is more subtle,  relying heavily on indirect controls such as small group pressures,  extensive surveillance, moralistic ideologies, positive reinforcements,  mythologies of benevolent leadership, and pleasant rituals to mask  underlying and potentially coercive power. As Sugimoto persuasively  demonstrates, &quot;Japanese friendly authoritarianism does not normally  exhibit its coercive face.&quot; But when all else fails, it can and does  exercise the full measure of its power. Sugimoto's book should inspire more  Western scholars to take a closer look at the informal mechanisms of  control in Japanese society. If Sugimoto is right, Japan has far to go  before it becomes a full-fledged democracy.	2000-03-28

Many Americans have grown increasingly disenchanted with the quality of national news coverage and journalist Kenneth Walsh is one of them. Taking aim at the vindictiveness and sensationalism that pervades coverage of the  White House in particular, Walsh attributes much of the blame, not  surprisingly, to shorter news cycles that encourage reporters to  &quot;advance the story&quot; with &quot;hard-edged&quot; analysis and  predictions, fierce competition for ratings, and the public's appetite for  entertainment over hard news. The strength of the book, I believe, lies in  his interviews with White House reporters and network news anchors. Their  reactions to Walsh's questions struck me as running the gamut from  surprisingly self-aware and candid to hopelessly defensive, sarcastic and  naive. The weaknesses of the book, while not outweighing the strengths, are  manifold. Walsh takes too much time to detail how, at the outset, Clinton  and his youthful press secretaries needlessly antagonized the press; in the  end, he concedes that Clinton's aversion to &quot;gotcha&quot; journalism  is well-founded, and that even deft handling of the White House press would  have done little to curb rampant negativism. And while he criticizes the  Clintons for failing to reveal enough of their private personas to the  media, Walsh also acknowledges that the unquenchable press appetite for  this sort of information exceeds the limits of human toleration. My most  serious reservations concern the author's conclusions. After identifying  the competitive pressures that drive the news business, Walsh seems to  forget about them as he lamely calls on journalists to restore professional  standards. And although many would agree with him that Washington reporters  often seem out of touch with the public, his cliched recommendation that  reporters reconnect with the &quot;real&quot; America, MIddle America,  seems to contravene his own agenda. If Middle America had a greater  predilectionfor hard news and reasoned presentation, as offered for  example on public radio and TV, it seems to me that commercial news sources  would be only too happy to oblige them.	2000-03-28

Notwithstanding its scholarly, measured language and meticulous documentation, this is a passionate,  absorbing, and infuriating story of corporate greed and criminal contempt  for the health of our country's foundry workers. The authors persuasively  argue that the lower the status and power of the workers, the greater was  their exposure to occupational health hazards. Despite the efforts of  courageous lone voices in government and academia, the facts about  silicosis were often suppressed. For example, a prestigious academic hired  with industry approval to investigate the relationship between sandblasting  and silicosis could not even publish his findings in a U.S. journal; his  article was published in Germany instead! That millions of workers suffered  severe disability and premature death due to silicosis had nothing to do  with ignorance. As in the case of the cigarette industry, the facts were  there: what was lacking was the government mandate and power to act on the  facts. Anyone who carefully follows this tragic tale of unrelenting,  unregulated greed and callousness by the foundries would do well to ponder  the overly generalized assaults on the evils of big government in the U.S.  Greater accountability and regulation earlier could have saved millions of  lives. By the way, as the authors point out, industry was quite willing to  embrace big government when it suited them. &quot;Employers who had opposed  the inclusion of silicosis... came running to the State pleading for the  inclusion... so that they would be protected against the unlimited and  terrifying common law damage suits which were being filed.&quot;	2000-03-28
