As a novel, it is less successful.  Jack Havoc never comes across as the truly wicked man all the other character say he is, and the famous scene in the church is grossly over-rated.  Thus, a rather pretentious return to the author's early `plum pudding' approach combined with her late style, which is often very good but equally often requires close and careful reading to avoid headache (particularly in the scenes with the ghastly ex-service men).	2003-09-23

Although the three murders seem to have something theatrically extravagant in their appearance, behind the gaudy costumes and elaborate stage-setting is nothing more than a rather dull series of murders, committed by a villain we hardly know for reasons that seem insufficient in a manner that is unconvincing.  The star performer, Dame Beatrice Bradley, hardly appears, and, however good company Laura Gavin and Kitty Trevelyan-Twigg may be, they are really no more than understudies.  Unsurprisingly, the audience is not amused.	2003-09-23

The best story is certainly \\"Rex v. Burnaby,\\" which offers a method of poisoning (by belladonna) nearly as clever as John Rhode's Vegetable Duck.  \\"Phyllis Annesley's Peril\\" is obvious but oh so ingenious in its description of how unbiased witnesses can, in all good faith, observe something which isn't there; interestingly, it is related to Sayers's \\"The Haunted Policeman\\" and John Dickson Carr's The Bride of Newgate.  The title story is an entertaining account of professional crime (burglary) and a safe that opens to a chronogram, allowing Thorndyke to demonstrate his genius at code-breaking.  In the same way, \\"A Mystery of the Sand-Hills\\" displays the sleuth's ability to reason from sand and sea; full of good Thorndykean detection, but the plot is rather obscure.  Analysis of dust and sand found on \\"The Green Check Jacket\\" allows Thorndyke to discover two murders caused by a will; a will is also at the root of the problem in that other account of physical detection, \\"The Mysterious Visitor.\\"  The three remaining stories are much weaker.  \\"A Sower of Pestilence\\" is too improbable and unmotivated a villain to carry conviction, and his plot is incredible, while the theft of \\"The Seal of Nebuchadnezzar\\" makes for a rather dull tale.  The very worst, though, is \\"The Apparition of Burling Court,\\" which is in almost every respect a reworking of \\"The Mandarin's Pearl,\\" and hence not worth the bother.	2003-09-23

Inspector Hemingway does a good job of discovering the persons who strangled a blackmailer / drug-dealer and his mistress.  The identity of the first murderer comes as a distinct surprise, although the alert reader will latch onto the second murderer as soon as the Marriages and Legitimacy Act is mentioned.  Several good red herrings, a nice use of the drug trade, and plenty of wit and amusing characters (Insp. Grant, Cynthia Haddington, Lord Guisborough) make this a  memorable tale.	2003-09-23

At once an elegant and deftly-observed social satire in the manner of Thackeray and an ingeniously complicated detective story, the book is virtually flawless.  Campion is in superb form throughout, both as detective pitting his wits against a superhuman Nemesis of a murderer, and as a lover (even going to the extent of throwing his fiance in the lake during a quarrel); Lugg is as amusing as ever; and there is much interest in the character and methods of the villain, \\"who can set the murderous Machiavel to school,\\" weaving webs of a subtlety and diabolical ingenuity matched only by his creator.	2003-09-23

The plot is a mess, with a lot of needless complications (all recounted in Allingham's obscure manner that makes Gladys Mitchell look sober and straightforward) failing to disguise the fact that there is no actual plot to speak of.  The murderer is known very early on, revealed and killed some chapters before the end, which is an anti-climax rivalled only by the behaviour of Albert Campion.	2003-09-23

The victims are two present-day Oakingtonians, brothers, and one of the masters, and the detective is an old Oakingtonian, Colin Revell, in the mould of Trent and Sheringham.  Hilton writes with wit and verve, and his character studies are uniformly excellent, while the false theories he devises show considerable ingenuity and make it a great pity that this was his only work in the genre.

The situation is wholly generic: murder done under cover of `The Murder Game,' and all the suspects have cast-iron alibis.  The murderer's is clever rather than convincing, but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues.  It is not, however, the central murder that damns the novel, but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements.  The facetiousness is embarrassing: Alleyn and Bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness, giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls, while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme.  The final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant \\"Russian element,\\" which badly dates the tale; indeed, the preposterous bratsvo-torture scenes are reminiscent of Walling and Wallace at their worst.  The previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling Cyrillics in the margins.	2003-07-13

It is more suspense than detection, and feminine at that: amidst a welter of domestic detail, the narrator and other characters keep discussing their feelings, rather than bothering to detect; hence, speculation takes the place of ratiocination.

When murder does take place, the victim is repellent, but arbitrary, and it is hard to take much interest in the unravelment of what passes for the problem.  The solution is notably unconvincing: if the murderer is planning to take his own life, why take another's to cover the traces?

With the second murder and its accompanying alibis, and a rather gruesome and sensationalistic third murder, the plot becomes extremely baffling.  Plenty of ingenious complications keep the reader interested in the plot and hesitating between three good suspects, and the book benefits from the absence of fat: none of those apt-to-become-tedious speculative sessions with Priestley, who contributes very little.  Where the book fails is in the solution: Waghorn pulls the solution out of a hat, with none of those pyrotechnic mental fireworks we expect from Priestley, but fireworks of a very different kind.  For this reason, the solution is rather thrillerish, and unconvincing: indeed, rather artificial, and a disappointing ending for what began as a good tangle.	2003-07-13

After the bizarre but effective opening, involving the utterly contemptible conman Routh, it runs out of vim.  The Oxford scenes are long-winded and singularly unamusing, populated by stereotyped dons and ghastly children of the sort that ought to be strangled at birth.  When the action \\"shifts gear\\" into a more thrillerish line, the book becomes merely dull: chases and abductions are inadequate compensation for an absence of detective interest and the irrelevance of Appleby.  At the end, a rather surprising villain is revealed, surprising only because the book relies, as it should never do, on a single clue.	2003-07-13

Dr. Priestley is both mentally and physically alert as he investigates the death of his friend Sir John Claverton, a near-perfect murder; indeed, so foolproof and unprovable is the method used that Dr. P. is forced to resort to a theatrical (if effective) sance in order to extract a confession, and one wonders whether the murderer would have been suspected had he not been forced by the conditions of Claverton's will to attempt a second (and obvious) murder.  Surprisingly for Rhode, the interest of the book does not lie wholly in the plot, for Street's writing is excellent, both drawing original characters (the Littlecotes; Dr. Oldland-Rhode could draw character, but his regulars, such as Merefield, became more stick-like as time went on) and steeping the book in spiritualistic gloom.	2003-07-13

It is the diverting story of an innocent (middle-aged scholar named Meredith) abroad, plunged into murder (one of which he commits, the other he instigates) and crime (the doings of the International Society for the Diffusion of Cultural Objects), against a picturesque backdrop of warehouse, ruined castle and Highland moor, and a lunatic nouveau riche connoisseur's American mansion.  Dialogue splendid, and the humour makes this Innes's funniest book: not only mild academic jests, but superb farce, largely provided by the pick of the gallery of certifiable lunatics: an endearing psychologist who is as mad as his patients (whom he believes have abducted him by furniture van to be instructed in sexology), who begins by believing that the furniture vans that keep following him are psychosexual hallucinations; to keep himself sane, he refuses to believe in any of the adventures that ensue when he is kidnapped.

Throughout, one is conscious of straining for effect, and, until the murder, the reader will find this one of the author's most tedious and uninspired jobs since the early books.  The matter is not helped by a particularly irritating hero, a snobbish and precious aesthete, nor by Alleyn's late appearance, after which he does little except talk to witnesses.  After the murder, if one can accept the large doses of hysteria, both masculine and feminine, the book becomes quite solid, and there is a novel twist on the alibi by wireless gimmick.	2003-07-13

Despite the excess of melodrama typical of the period and the extraordinary coincidences, many of the scenes are excellent, with just the right touch of the picturesque to suggest the \\"Baghdad-on-Thames\\" common to Stevenson, Carr and Freeman.  Where the book suffers is by comparison to the later D'Arblay Mystery (1926), which reuses the plot to much greater effect.

There are only two suspects, who, of course, each need a detective to follow their trail: an interesting technique that, dividing the reader's sympathies between the cocky and impetuous Lott and the unimaginatively logical Dawle, focuses the interest on the detection without the need for any silly most unlikely culprit.

Although the solution is justly famous, it is but a variation on \\"The Norwood Builder,\\" at much greater length.

Since the murder is committed three-quarters of the way through, and to the accompaniment of excessive coincidence and too many cardboard mad villains, there is little room for any interest in the crime, so the solution is as anti-climactic as it is unconvincing.	2003-07-13

Poirot faces a group of super-criminals: a fiendish Oriental (a la Fu Manchu), an American millionaire, a mad scientist (\\"mad-mad-mad with the madness of genius!\\"), and \\"the destroyer,\\" who are behind all the world problems: \\"the world-wide unrest, the labour troubles that beset every nation, and the revolutions that break out in some,\\" as well as Lenin and Trotsky, \\"mere puppets whose every action was dictated by another's brain.\\"  Their ultimate goal is, of course, to use a laser beam to take over the world.  The bulk of the book concerns various loosely related cases (some of which, such as \\"A Chess Problem,\\" are ingenious enough), but too many episodes are appropriate to a shilling shocker: e.g., Hastings, having refused a fiendish Oriental devil's order to lure Poirot into a trap on pain of death (with typical English understatement, \\"that Chinese devil meant business, I was sure of that.  It was goodbye to the good old world.\\"), capitulates when he learns that his wife will die by the Seventy Lingering Deaths.  And so it gets sillier and sillier as it goes on, until, Poirot having died and come back from the dead as an imaginary twin brother, it ends with the Big Four blowing up the Dolomites in a mass suicide pact.

It gets off to a flying start with French's investigations into the disappearance of Magill in the vicinity of Whitehead, the discovery of his corpse, and the stripping away of the preliminary levels of the plot.  Halfway through, though, the rattling pace comes to a grinding halt, and is replaced by a steady, if steadily unexciting, walking pace.  It cannot be said that French does much reasoning: there is much inquiry into the movements of trains and boats (too mathematical for the lay reader), but his detection consists largely of interviewing witness after witness and letting them solve the puzzle for him.  The reader is more fortunate, for the solution is obvious from the very beginning.  Since the sleeping draught is given on Wednesday and much attention is paid to the details of Wednesday night, it is quite obvious that the Thursday night business is fake.  The solution is over-complicated, and the mass conspiracy to murder one man seems a case of overkill.  How superior is The Five Red Herrings!	2003-07-12

While Parker remained unconvinced, Wimsey believed that he had found \\"the case [he had] always been looking for.  The case of cases.  The murder without discernible means, or motives or clue.  The norm\\"-for he believed that there were far more unsuspected murders than the \\"failures\\" known to Scotland Yard.  There was no evidence to suggest how Miss Dawson could have died other than from natural causes-yet all the clues pointed to murder having been done.  For example, there was the death of Miss Dawson's maid, Bertha Gotobed, also of natural causes-yet the presence of an empty bottle of beer, the absence of a bottle-opener, and the presence of highly expensive ham, discovered in a Baileyesque investigation, all indicated that somebody else had been on the scene.  And Bertha Gotobed's sister, Mrs. Cropper, returning from Canada, saw Miss Dawson's great-niece Mary Whittaker waiting for her at the train station.  Mary Whittaker, who stood to gain if she killed her great-aunt before the New Property Act was passed, struck Wimsey as the main suspect-and this is one of Sayers' books, like WHOSE BODY? and STRONG POISON, where the villain's identity is obvious from the start, allowing Sayers to create a memorable portrait of evil, for \\"when a woman is wicked and unscrupulous, she is the most ruthless criminal in the world-fifty times more than a man, because she is always so much more single-minded about it.\\"  Wimsey sends Miss Climpson-who is his \\"ears and [his] tongue, and especially [his] nose.  She asks questions which a young man could not put without a blush.  She is the angel that rushes in where fools get a clump on the head.  She can smell a rat in the dark.

Three Act-Tragedy (1935) and Murder in Mesopotamia (1936) are examples of this-a pity because both books have interesting personages, well-drawn depictions of a particular society (here the demi-monde; an archaeological dig in the other), and a particular tone (light and amusing in the style of Anthony Berkeley in the one; in the other, an ominous atmosphere quite unlike anything else Agatha Christie ever wrote).  But the solutions to both are wholly incredible: the reader of Murder in Mesopotamia is expected to believe that a highly observant and intelligent woman is utterly blind to the disguise adopted by her murderer; while Three-Act Tragedy offers an utterly murderer who commits three crimes, two of which are wholly superfluous, tripling the risk of detection to no benefit.<br />The impossible murders themselves are by nicotine, \\"an odourless liquid, ...[of which] a few drops are enough to kill a man almost instantaneously\\", and which can be derived from rose-spraying liquid and from ordinary tobacco.  The first victim is a particularly mild and benevolent parson, who is killed at a party given by the actor Sir Charles Cartwright (who suspects murder).  The guests include the impoverished Lady Mary Lytton Gore and her daughter `Egg', née Hermione; the actress Angela Sutcliffe, Sir Charles' former lover; the dress-maker Cynthia Dacres (with whose salon L.W.T., maker of the POIROT televison series, would have a great deal of fun) and her drunken husband; the playwright Muriel Wills; and the journalist Oliver Manders, in love with `Egg'.  The regular reader of Christie, however, will recognise both Hercule Poirot, who is bored, only begins to function on p. 117, and is staying (for some unknown reason) at the Ritz; and Mr. Satterthwaite, known to the reader from the excellent short story collection The Mysterious Mr. Quin.  Both of these sleuths, with the assistance of Sir Charles and `Egg' Lytton Gore, assist in the detection of the crime-but it is, however, only Hercule Poirot who is not taken in by the stage trappings, who \\"see[s] only the facts without any dramatic trappings or footlights\\".  The second victim is the nerve specialist Sir Bartholomew Strange, killed at a party in Yorkshire, attended by the same people (with the exception of Poirot, Sir Charles, and Mr. Satterthwaite, who are all in France); his butler goes missing, and the clue of an ink-stain on the floor of his room leads to the discovery of blackmail letters and the possibility of his murder.  While certainly not one of Christie's best, the reader may still find entertainment in the book (and doesn't have to put up with Peter Ustinov's over-acting and a horde of bad actors loose in Mexico).	2001-12-29
US	47307239	R3RG8MI61SN9EB	0586072535	487480104	Exit Lines	Books	5	25	25	N	N	Review	EXIT LINES (Reginald Hill, 1984) is a particularly good book, even by Reginald Hill's particularly high standards.  It tackles the themes of death and ageing in both a humorous and a tragic way, showing the keen intelligence and humanity of the author.<br />The book opens with the deaths of three old men on a November night: as Detective Inspector Pascoe remarks, decidedly \\"not a good night for the old\\".  One was murdered in his bathtub, his daughter arriving just in time to hear him gasp \\"Charley\\" and die; one died of exposure on playing fields, the discoverer of the body hearing him cry \\"Polly\\"; and the third murmured \\"Paradise!  Driver... fat bastard...pissed!\\"-understandably so, for Superintendent Dalziel was in the car which hit him.  The dying messages serve as clues as enigmatic as death itself, reinforced by the choice of dying words as chapter headings (great fun for those quotation spotters and spouters out there!).  Police work uncovers connections between the supposedly separate cases-and police corruption hovering in the air, with Dalziel going on a shooting spree (of pheasants, that is)-\\"grand\\".<br />Reginald Hill shows himself as a keen observer of humanity, fascinated by the human race-but not becoming bogged down in Ruth Rendell's social conscience or P.D. James' bleak pessimism, but instead remembering that the writer's first duty is to the reader, to entertain.  Take, for example, Ellie Pascoe's father's senility as an example of how to handle family background problems without intrusion: it is secondary to the plot, but is there as a play on the book's theme of ageing, and also serves to provide a vital clue.  Characterisation is superlative, the reader really feeling sympathy for the characters, or despising those who view the old as a burden.  Hill achieves this through a remarkable mixture of humour and genuine emotion, contrasting-but never clashing-humour with grief in succeeding paragraphs.  Old age is really brought home to the reader by the senile dementia of Mrs. Escott, a genuinely pathetic and well-drawn character.<br />The whole-detective story, novel elements-culminates in a particularly neat and moving ending in which all the loose ends tied up, with both good clues and affecting murderers.  This book shows Reginald Hill at the height of his powers-without any doubt the best of the modern writers of detective stories who are still writing.	2001-12-06
US	47307239	R19OH6L891A2B	0156658992	30158	The Nine Tailors	Books	5	68	74	N	N	Review	This novel, Dorothy L. Sayers' best-known, is, without doubt, one of her best-if not the best.  Sayers takes the customary English village, and makes something new of it, by setting it in the Fen country, and by giving to it a church, which, as the well-drawn rector describes, \\"East Anglia is famous for the size and splendour of its parish churches.  Still, we flatter ourselves we are almost unique, even in this part of the world.\\"  The church services show great feeling and power, and neatly tie in with the theme of religion.  The church possesses bells, the book being best-known for the bell-ringing, described in such powerfully beautiful descriptions as:<br />\\"Out over the flat, white wastes of fen, over the spear-straight, steel-dark dykes and the wind-bent, groaning poplar trees, bursting from the snow-choked louvres of the belfry, whirled away southward and westward in gusty blasts of clamour to the sleeping counties went the music of the bells-little Gaude, silver Sabaoth, strong John and Jericho, glad Jubilee, sweet Dimity and old Batty Thomas, with great Tailor Paul bawling and striding like a giant in the midst of them.  Up and down went the shadows of the ringers upon the walls, up and down went the shadows of the ringers upon the walls, up and down went the scarlet sallies flickering roofwards and floorwards, and up and down, hunting in their courses, went the bells of Fenchurch St. Paul.\\"<br />The bells are also eerily threatening-\\"Bells are like cats and mirrors-they're always queer, and it doesn't do to think too much about them.\\"-which is fitting, as the plot hinges on bells: both an ingenious cryptogram (again, to quote the rector, \\"I should never have thought of the possibility that one might make a cipher out of change-ringing.  Most ingenious.\\"), and an ingenious murder method.<br />The whodunit aspect of the story is not neglected; for once, it is a genuine problem.  The body is buried in a grave, and involves a complicated problem of identity,and an unknown method.  The victim, as Wimsey describes, is \\"a perfect nuisance, dead or alive, and whoever killed him was a public benefactor.  I wish I'd killed him myself.\\"  Wimsey is engaging here, and not the parody of Bertie Wooster he sometimes is-he is a human being, without being the equally obnoxious creature found in Gaudy Night and Busman's Honeymoon.  The detection is excellent, and, as was to be the trend in nearly every detective story following (especially Nicholas Blake's), the detective \\"felt depressed.  So far as he could see, his interference had done no good to anybody and only made extra trouble.  It was a thousand pities that the body of Deacon had ever come to light at all.  Nobody wanted it.\\"  These tie in with the burden of guilt and innocence, redemption and repentance.<br />Finally, the book comes to its powerful climax in a flooded village, \\"with an aching and intolerable melancholy, like the noise of the bells of a drowned city pushing up through the overwhelming sea.\\"<br />This is not a detective story-this is, if anything, a novel.	2001-12-06

US	47307239	R1A0O5ZXDHOQOU	0060921390	222691730	With a Bare Bodkin	Books	2	0	4	N	N	Review	This is a rather dull entry in Cyril Hare's usually excellent series of detective stories.  Francis Pettigrew makes his second appearance, as Legal Advisor to the Pin Control, an obscure government department lodged in a former mansion belonging to the late Lord Eglwyswrw, who \\"chose this really lovely, but confoundedly breezy, site overlooking the sea, to plant this monstrous structure.  How anybody can have seriously proposed to live in such bloated magnificence, I can't imagine.  Perhaps nobody really could-at least, his lordship died within a couple of months of making the attempt, since when it stood empty until some genius realised that the marble halls were simply ideal for accommodating platoons of typists and that the endless marble corridors were just made for female messengers to run clattering down with files, or more often teapots, in their hands.\\"  It is teapots which are at the heart of the mystery, for the victim is a former lunatic, murdered while preparing tea.  Ironically, the victim was the proposed murderess in a fictional murder plotted by the suspects-\\"now in some nightmare fashion the plot had come alive, the silly farce turned itself into grim tragedy.\\"  A similar plot exists in Ngaio Marsh's ARTISTS IN CRIME.  Unfortunately, as in Ngaio Marsh's detective stories, the mystery is dull beyond belief, the detection consisting entirely of serial interviewing in the worst Ngaio Marsh style-even the policeman feels `that we're not going to make an arrest in this case by sitting here and talking about it!'  The most probable suspect is the murderer, and there is no ingenuity.<br />The civil service aspect of the story is well-depicted, with several amusing caricatures, bearing out the Pin Controller's statement that `the temporary civil servant is the bane of government in war-time.'  There is \\"a very pretty little Black Market affair which affects the Control\\", dealing in pins, and run by some of the suspects.<br />There is some good characterisation--Miss Brown who wishes to marry a surrogate father, and who ends up marrying Pettigrew, the unwilling detective, who feels of murder that \\"this was precisely the set of circumstances that he would instinctively seek to avoid, with which he felt utterly incompetent to deal.  All his working life had been spent in resolving other people's problems, but they had been the problems of strangers, dealt with at arm's length through the medium of a solicitor, and considered in the quiet, dust-laden atmosphere of the Temple, where matters of life and death, fortune and bankruptcy resolved themselves into carefully phrased opinions and the comparison of reported cases.  ...  He felt deeply aggrieved that fate should have set such a burden on his shoulders, but he saw now that he could no longer simply pretend that the burden wasn't there.'<br />The burden in the book, however, is mainly on the reader's shoulders, for the book is so utterly dull that it is impossible to sustain any interest in the plot.	2001-12-06

They're not easy people to get at from a police point of view, and now there's a poisoner loose among `em.\\"  Allingham sketches in the strange culture of the Palinode family as effortlessly as she did the family in Police at the Funeral.  The eccentricity of the Palinodes can be gauged by their habit of speaking in crosswords-\\"If the Palinode `family language' consisted of references to the classics, a good memory and a comprehensive dictionary of quotations should go a long way.\\"<br />It is into this strange boarding-house inhabited by eccentrics that Mr. Campion enters, posing as the nephew of the house-owner Renee Roper, who first appeared in Dancers in Mourning.  Faced with these eccentric yet impractical geniuses, Campion \\"felt that, intellectually speaking, he was having a conversation with someone at the other end of a circular tunnel, and was in fact standing directly back to back with her.  On the other hand, of course, it was possible that he had become Alice in Wonderland.\\"  The effect is the same on the reader, who steps into a world in which the unusual is commonplace, and in which everything normal is twisted out of recognition into some new mathematical perversion, so that the reader, like Alice in Through the Looking-Glass, finds himself stepping through the door-and ending up back where he started, utterly confused-a maze, amazed.  Like Lewis Carroll's classics, the book is at once humorous and disturbing, the whole approach summed up in the following dialogue:<br />`If you hear any thumping it's just the undertaker.'<br />`The ultimate reassurance, said Campion.<br />Humorous and hilarious-but the undercurrent of something wrong, of death, of insanity, of things not being quite right, is vividly tangible.  London suburbia is transformed into something rich and strange, a world in which the sordidness of gangsterdom is contrasted with the bizarre symbolism of the means they use to escape the law--somehow involved with the shady undertaking business of Magersfontein Lugg's brother-in-law Jas. Bowels, a symbol of the unpredictability of the book's approach-\\"an unreliable interment hardly bore imagining\\".  The whole culminates in a surreal chase of a coffin brake through London by police squad cars-the real world has fused with the world of the bizarre-the mad world of the Palinodes.<br />The solution is perhaps rather cluttered, with the villain's professional criminal activities successfully carried out on one hand, his bungling amateur murders on the other.  Yet the criminal's desire to \\"stop the clock\\"-a motive corresponding to the fact that the book's Dickensian approach is \\"an impressive anachronism, unlikely and nearly as decorative as a coach-and-four\\"-is well-conveyed, suiting the impression of the character the reader has received from his description and profession-character takes the place of clues, although the clues that are there are well designed, one of glasses in particular being well-hidden yet stressing the idea of frozen time, old habits dying hard.<br />More Work for the Undertaker is one of Margery Allingham's best-a book which lingers in the mind, filled with unforgettable characters and scenes, and with a plot bizarre and baroque, a rich triumph of the imagination-the reader can only applause and say, \\"Oh, very good, very good indeed...  Nicely told and very good work.\\"	2001-12-06
US	47307239	RVOCS4HMW4J90	0425093255	973285060	Five Little Pigs (Also published as Murder In Retrospect)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Review	\\"The truth has a habit of making itself known.  Even after many years\\"-a maxim that sums up Five Little Pigs (Agatha Christie, 1942), quite simply one of the best books she has ever written, combining the well-written \\"novel\\" of The Hollow or Taken at the Flood with the classic plotting of her books of the 1930s--producing a book as satisfying as Nicholas Blake at his best.<br />This book, the first investigation into a murder committed in the past (and one of the many nursery rhyme books, the rhyme inappropriate to the general tone of the piece), tells of the murder of Amyas Crale, apparently poisoned by his wife Caroline sixteen years before, found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment, dying in prison.  Their daughter, also Caroline, believes that her mother did not kill her father, and hires Hercule Poirot to find out who did, on the grounds that \\"a case of murder is a case of murder whether it happened yesterday or sixteen years ago\\".  Poirot is, of necessity, at his most cerebral here-as Caroline Crale II tells him, `It's psychology that interests you, isn't it?  Well, that doesn't change with time.  The tangible things are gone-the cigarette-end and the footprints and the bent blades of grass.  You can't look for those any more.  But you can go over all the facts of the case, and perhaps talk to the people who were there at the time-they're all alive still-and then-and then, as you said just now, you can lie back in your chair and think.  And you'll know what really happened...'<br />In an attempt to find out the truth, Poirot approaches the five survivors of the tragedy-Mrs. Crale's sister, the explorer Angela Warren; Crale's mistress, Elsa Greer, \\"a discordant shriek of triumph\\", whose youthful callousness and vibrancy are well-handled; Crale's boyhood friend, the stock-broker Philip Blake; his brother, Meredith, the local squire whose hobby is manufacturing poisons; and the governess, Cecilia Williams-and asks them to write for him their accounts of the tragedy, as he \\"genuinely want[s] to re-create the past, to feel and see the events that took place, to see behind the obvious and to visualise the thoughts and feelings of the actors in the drama\\".  The five accounts of the tragedy offer a different perspective on the events, serving to round out the characters-Angela Warren comes across as youthful and innocent, Elsa Greer as passionate and selfish, Meredith Blake as verbose and meandering, Philip Blake as blunt and direct, and Miss Williams as rigidly intellectual-the various characters contrasting with each other to produce more varied characterisation than Christie's usual efforts, vivid though they are.  Much depends on how the characters view the three characters at the centre of the triangle.  Is Mrs. Crale \\"a cold, calculating woman, a scheming woman who planned ... murder ... and got away with it\\", or a \\"gentle creature\\", a martyr to her husband's adulteries?  Is Elsa Greer \\"one of the loveliest, crudest most flamboyant bits of exciting colouring [Amyas Crale] had ever seen\\", \\"a predatory Juliet\\", or \\"vulnerable\\" by benefit of the \\"youth, the sheer blazing vitality\\" that attracted Crale to her?  Only Crale himself is \\"a ruthless, selfish, good-tempered, happy egoist ... [who] was a full-blooded man and ... loved life\\"-cut short in the middle of it by a hand believed to be that of his wife.<br />Finally, after mulling through the accounts, and deducing from excellent clues of dialogue, physical clues, and symbolism, Poirot-for once not the centre of attention, but the five characters themselves-announces a very startling solution-an excellent reversal of events as the reader has been led to expect them-yet seeming inevitable, due to the skill of character-drawing, so that the solution is deeply moving.  It is unlikely that the murderer will be arrested, as the punishment is self-inflicted.<br />Five Little Pigs is perhaps Christie's best book: the characterisation is vivid and affecting, the solution startling and moving, the clues well-chosen, and the atmosphere sorrowful and tender.  This is Christie writing at the top of her powers.	2001-12-06

And so, \\"once more a murder is announced-for the benefit and enjoyment of Miss Marple.\\"<br />The setting is Chipping Cleghorn, which is perhaps Christie's best-drawn village setting-and certainly the quintessential Miss Marple novel.  Christie vividly captures the feeling of how \\"the world has changed since the war...  Fifteen years ago one knew who everybody was...  If anybody new-really new-really a stranger-came, well, they stuck out-everybody wondered about them and didn't rest till they found out.  But it's not like that any more.  Every village and small country place is full of people who've just come and settled there without any ties to bring them...  And people just come-and all you know about them is what they say of themselves...  Nobody knows any more who anyone is.\\"  It is this feeling of insecurity Christie admirably captures that allows the ingenious plot-quite simply one of her best-to take place.  Despite the beauty of the village, however, the simple rural cosiness, \\"there was a nightmarish feeling at the back of [Detective Inspector Craddock's] mind.  It was like a familiar dream where an undertone of menace grows and finally turns Ease into Terror...\\"  Neighbour cannot trust neighbour, and the tension slowly mounts-no atmospherics here, simply first-rate characterisation, with Christie particularly good at depicting elderly spinsters, with a sympathetic treatment of lesbianism and of old age.<br />Miss Marple's statement that \\"one is alone when the last one who remembers is gone.  I have nephews and nieces and kind friends-but there's no one who knew me as a young girl-no one who belongs to the old days.  I've been alone for quite a long time now\\" captures the whole feeling of the book-elderly spinsters living in solitude in the country, dependent upon each other for their comfort.  At the heart of the novel are five old women: Miss Marple, the detective, \\"the finest detective God ever made.  Natural genius cultivated in a suitable soil...\\"; Miss Blacklock and Miss Bunner; and Miss Hinchcliffe and Miss Murgatroyd.  Miss Blacklock and Miss Hinchcliffe are the dominant partners, shrewd and capable; while Miss Bunner and Miss Murgatroyd are woolly-minded and amiable, dependent upon their stronger-minded friends for security.  Yet when Miss Bunner and Miss Murgatroyd are both murdered, the true depths of the feelings-of the dependency-Miss Blacklock and Miss Hinchcliffe felt is made apparent.  These portraits of love and grief are unrivalled anywhere else in Christie's books, and show her ability to create human characters.<br />Miss Marple herself is at the top of her powers, actively detecting.  Sir Henry Clithering remarks that \\"an elderly unmarried woman who knits and gardens is streets ahead of any detective sergeant.  She can tell you what might have happened and what ought to have happened and even what actually did happen!  And she can tell you why it happened!\\"  Although she deprecates her abilities, modestly claiming that she has \\"no gifts at all-except perhaps a certain knowledge of human nature\\", her ability to reason from both material clues and dialogue is seen at its best; and she is an active player for once, reasoning and sleuthing like the best of them.<br />Setting and characterisation aside, the plot itself is one of Christie's best.  It is complicated, \\"all so complex, nearly all so trivial and if one thing isn't trivial, it's so hard to spot which one-like a needle in a haystack\\", but not cluttered-one of Christie's gifts.  The motive, stated quite clearly from the beginning, is money, and Miss Marple \\"know[s] only too well the really terrible things that people will do to lay their hands on a lot of money.\\"  Yet the identity of the real beneficiary / murderer isso well-hidden, aided by \\"the most amazing impersonation\\", that the reader will never work out the meaning of the clues, despite Miss Marple's listing them.<br />\\"You could get away with a great deal if you had enough audacity\\", Miss Marple reflects at one point-and both murderess and author do have enough audacity.so well-hidden, aided by \\"the most amazing impersonation\\", that the reader will never work out the meaning of the clues, despite Miss Marple's listing them.<br />\\"You could get away with a great deal if you had enough audacity\\", Miss Marple reflects at one point-and both murderess and author do have enough audacity.	2001-12-06

It seems to the police and the prosecution a `sealed box' mystery, for there are only five suspects: three hotel staff-members, and two guests, so that one of them must have done it-and Mlle. Lamartine the likeliest suspect.  However, as Macrea, counsel for the defence, proves, \\"the whole thing [is] like a jigsaw puzzle which has been half done by an inexpert child.  Any bit that seems to fit has been left in.  Any bit that doesn't fit has been disregarded.\\"  All of the suspects have connections to either the French Underworld or Underground, so that, although this is a murder committed in England, it is in fact \\"the murder of a man who had done most of his war service in France, by a French girl, whom he was alleged to have met in France, in a hotel kept by a Frenchman with an Italian waiter who had spent all of his war service in France.\\"<br />It is in France that the deep roots lie-the deep roots which must be uncovered to expose the dirty truth.  It is amongst \\"the hate and the fear, the hysterics and the exaggeration and the heroism\\" of occupied France-\\"an unknown and rather frightening landscape ... where it might be necessary-where it might be most necessary and desirable-to be able to kill yourself quickly\\" that the pasts of Major Thoseby, of Victoria Lamartine, and of M. Sainte the hotel manager lie.  It is in France that \\"forces [are] at work, forces which ... had already reached out and touched [Nap] at the extremities of their huge, opposed organisations\\"-gold smugglers and the Sûreté.  And it is in post-war France-a country which \\"is not a very happy one at this moment\\", as Gilbert vividly depicts-that Nap Rumbold, the lawyer for the defence who appearedin other Gilbert novels, \\"fight[ing] a long, dirty, blackguarding campaign in which we shall use every subterfuge that the Law allows, and perhaps even a few that it doesn't\\", searches for the truth, his efforts alternating with scenes of the courtroom drama.  These thriller elements are well used, and do not stick out like a chewed-off ear.  Although Nap complains that \\"[American magazines] have one habit that I find irritating.  They start a story, get you really interested in it, and then-what happens?  You turn the page and find you are in the middle of quite a different one...  That's exactly what's happening here, don't you see?  I started out reading a murder mystery.  It seems to have turned into a gold smuggling melodrama.  What's the connection between the death of Major Thoseby last March in the Family Hotel and a large-scale gold smuggling racket?\\", it soon becomes clear that all the elements tie neatly together, forming a cohesive and extremely satisfactory whole, in this, one of the classic post-war detective stories.	2001-12-06

Having written several donnish detective stories of outrageous complexity, Innes turned his attention to the thriller, in the manner of John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps and Nicholas Blake's The Smiler with the Knife-and the result cannot be highly praised.<br />The book opens well, with the inexplicable murder of a particularly harmless and wholesome poet-a beginning both intriguing and humorous, with Appleby actively detecting.  \\"And yet this element-the intellectual element, you may term it-is not the thing's main fascination.\\"  With the beginning of Chapter 4, originality is thrown to the winds, as Appleby and detection are replaced with the story of Sheila Grant, a heroine on the run in Scotland-\\"untroubled by whatever issues-grave they might be or petty merely-hung upon the strange intrigue on which she had stumbled.  She was escaping; she was manoeuvring; she was going to turn the tables yet.  It was the game of games.  On just this all games ever invented were exactly based.\\"  Actually, this \\"game\\" was \\"exactly based\\" on John Buchan...  The Scottish setting is not up to the level of Innes' earlier Lament for a Maker, nor up to Gladys Mitchell's standards, despite the evocation of \\"a smell of peat and bell-heather and true heather and pine-needles thick upon the ground.\\"  As in The Journeying Boy, the story alternates between Appleby and Sheila Grant.  Sheila Grant having been introduced, Appleby fades into the limelight, doing very little until very late in the book, when an outrageous transvestite battle takes place.<br />The elements of the plot are not themselves distinguished: poetry and espionage, and inadequately combined.  Poetry is used by spies to convey secret information before witnesses-\\"a smart way of going about something plumb crazy\\", it is termed, but the idea of poetry used to conceal hidden messages is an old one, and not up to the standards of either Dorothy L.

Until he meets his demise (a chapter or two from the end--an unusual step in a detective story), however, the reader is entertained by the background of the life led by a Circuit Judge, surrounded by ritual; enthralled by the amusing and vivid characterisation, the characters deftly touched with real sympathy and empathy-the story is to the fore without diminishing the impact of the detection; and bamboozled by an ingenious and complicated plot relying on an obscure legal point, disclosed by the disillusioned and disappointed lawyer Francis Pettigrew, a most unlikely yet very human (anti) hero, who appeared in other detective stories by Cyril Hare.	2001-12-06

Sayers introduced her famous detective Lord Peter Wimsey, or \\"Sherlock Holmes, disguised as a walking gentleman\\", and established herself as a mistress of the detective story.<br />Although Lord Peter Wimsey is here perhaps too bright and breezy, he proves to be an entertaining companion to crime, despite his suffering from conscience.  He enjoys the detection, \\"but if it comes to really running down a live person and getting him hanged, or even quodded, poor devil, there don't seem as if there was any excuse for me buttin' in, since I don't have to make my livin' by it.  And I feel as if I oughtn't ever to find it amusin'.  But I do.\\"  The reader, who has no conscience to worry him, enjoys the whole thing without needing to consult their consciences, for the story is bright and amusing, well-written and often very funny, even if somewhat in the Wodehousian vein.<br />Although Lord Peter Wimsey is a vivid but undeveloped character, the rest of the characters are all quite vivid: the Dowager Duchess of Denver is an excellent character, and, by the standards of the day, Sayers seems to have not too much racism / anti-Semitism.<br />Despite all the humour, the serious business of detection is not neglected.  Opening with the fine and striking idea of the body in the bathtub-rightly described as an \\"uncommon good incident for a detective story\\", and an interesting problem of identity-the trail gets more complicated with the disappearance of Sir Reuben Levy.  The murderer's identity is revealed half-way through-a trait that would recur in later Sayers novels, and the pleasure of the second half of the book is in seeing an elaborate, ingenious, and often gory, plot unfold.<br />It is interesting to note that Sayers, an Anglo-Catholic, chose a scientist / atheist as her murderer, a villain who believes that \\"the knowledge of good and evil is an observed phenomenon, attendant upon a certain condition of the brain cells, which is removable...\\"-a belief striking at the very core of Christianity, and a belief leading the murderer to the belief that murder is a justifiable action.  In this, Sayers resembles Chesterton, and, in particular, \\"The Wrong Shape\\".  In Lord Peter Wimsey's realisation of the murderer's guilt, Christianity is again apparent, for Wimsey seems to solve the crime through receiving a divine revelation (although the clues are all there-detection from physical clues in the Thorndykean manner): \\"he remembered-not one thing, not another thing, nor a logical succession of things, but everything-the whole thing, perfect, complete, in all its dimensions as it were and instantaneously; as if he stood outside the world and saw it suspended in infinitely dimensional space.  He no longer needed to reason about it, or even to think about it.  He knew it.\\"<br />An excellent first attempt at the detective story, and the reader can agree with Wimsey that although \\"this is only a blinkin' old shillin' shocker ... we're up against a criminal-the criminal-the real artist and blighter with imagination-real, artistic, finished stuff.

It is much to Christie's credit that she is able to play perfectly fair-or, as Poirot says, `Of facts, I keep nothing to myself.  But to everyone his own interpretation of them.'  Of course, this being an Agatha Christie-and her masterpiece-the reader's interpretation is certain to be wrong.  The solution is Christie' best known, and certainly her most ingenious, use of misdirection and playing on the reader's expectations.  As well as being ingenious, it is also emotionally disturbing in a particularly subtle way.<br />The plot is-apparently-quite standard.  The book is set in a small village, \\"King's Abbot, ... very much like any other village. Our big town is Cranchester, nine miles away.  We have a large railway station, a small post office, and two rival `General Stores'.  Able-bodied men are apt to leave the place early in life, but we are rich in unmarried ladies and retired military officers.  Our hobbies and recreations can be summed up in the one word, `gossip'.\\"  This is the first depiction of village life-complete with gossip grapevine-in Christie, something that would become central to the long and indifferent series of Miss Marple novels.  The squire, Roger Ackroyd, is stabbed to death in the study of his country house-although never stated as such, it is clear that the book is an effective parody of the generic detective story.  Hercule Poirot, now in retirement and growing vegetable marrows, but growing disillusioned-`Can you figure to yourself, monsieur, that a man may work towards a certain object, may labour and toil to attain a certain kind of leisure and occupation, and then find that, after all, he yearns for the old busy days, and the old occupations that he thought himself so glad to leave?'-is called upon to investigate the case, assisted by the narrator, Dr. Sheppard, \\"a man of middle age, a doctor,a man who knows the folly and the vanity of most things in this life of ours\\", who, it seems to Poirot, \\"must indeed have been sent from the good God to replace my friend Hastings.\\"<br />Poirot's statement that \\"everyone has something to hide\\" is borne out, as the little Belgian detective unravels a complicated strand of secret marriages, mysterious strangers, blackmail, and three village tragedies.  Poirot's detection relies on physical clues, for \\"a tongue is not enough.  [The walls] would have to have also eyes and ears.  But do not be too sure that these dead things are always dumb.  To me they speak sometimes-chairs, tables-they have their message!\\"  The clues are chosen with skill, and it would be impossible to improve upon the masterly juggling with times and alibis-relying on the now worn-out Dictaphone gambit (which is more convincing than in THE CANARY MURDER CASE of S.S. Van Dine, published a year later).<br />Finally, Christie does not neglect the humorous side of the story.  The tone is witty and malicious, and the characters vivid even for Christie: Miss Sheppard (a prototype for Miss Marple) and Mrs. Ackroyd are both genuinely funny, and the Mah Jong evening, where \\"a good deal of gossip is handed round at these evenings, sometimes seriously interfering with the game in progress\\", is a classic.<br />This, then, is one of Christie's masterpieces-if not THE masterpiece.	2001-12-06

Superintendent Spence, who arrested Bentley, does not feel that Bentley was guilty, and turns to Hercule Poirot for help.  Poirot, aged and bored, jumps at Supt. Spences request for help, and travels to the village of Broadhinny (one of Christies few working-class backgrounds), going as himself, pretending that [he] know[s] a great deal  [is] not satisfied about the verdict in the McGinty case  [has] a very shrewd suspicion of what really happened [for] there is a circumstance that [he], alone, estimate[s] at its true value  And then, having made [his] effect, [he shall] observe the reactions.  For there should be reactions.  Unfortunately, the most immediate reaction is that he is nearly pushed underneath a trainone of the few cases in Christie, outside of the execrable The Big Four, where Poirot himself is endangered.  And to what avail?  For Poirot, like the reader, has no sympathy for Bentley, a pathological case if ever there was one, a self-centred creature who had never thought much of anyone but himself.  A man ungrateful for the efforts that were being made to save himalmost, one might say, uninterested in them.  Coupled with this unprepossessing suspect, Poirot also has to stay at an amusingly bad guesthouse, where he suffers the cooking of Mme. Summerhayes  [which] is not cooking at all.  And the draughts, the cold winds, the upset stomachs of the cats, the long hairs of the dogs, the broken legs of the chairs, the terrible, terrible bed in which [he] sleeps, the tepid water in the bathroom, the holes in the stair carpet, and the coffeewords cannot describe to you the fluidwhich they serve to you as coffee.  It is an affront to the stomach. <br />Yet, despite the insult afforded him by Bentley and the horrible circumstances in which he finds himself, Poirot, working on the clue of a bottle of ink purchased by Mrs. McGinty two days before her murder in order to write a letter, is led to the conclusion that Mrs. McGinty was killed for recognising a photograph of one of four Women Victims of Bygone Tragediesa blow to the desperate respectability of the middle-class inhabitants of Broadhinny, who are all very nice people  That has been, before now, a motive for murder. The suspects (including the tiresomely invalid Mrs. Wetherby) and dialogue are entertaining and well observedthis is Christie at her liveliest.  Among the best characters is Christies self-parody, Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, in her first appearance since Cards on the Table 16 years beforeused by her real-life counterpart to comment on the adaptation of her plays:<br />So far its pure agony.  Why I ever let myself in for it I dont know.  My books bring me in quite enough moneythat is to say the blood-suckers take most of it, and if I made more, theyd take more, so I dont overstrain myself.  But youve no idea of the agony of having your characters taken and made to say things that they never would have said, and do things that they never would have done.  And if you protest, all they say is that its good theatre.<br />As well as being a thoroughly entertaining read (as most Christies except the late ones are), the management of suspicion is well done, and the book boasts one of Christies best surprise!!! solutions, in which she plays such devilishly ingenious tricks with the readers assumptions, relying on the ease with which [she] misled [the reader] without uttering an untrue word, his bafflement, his stupendous astonishment when he at last perceived the truth that had been clear to [Poirot] all along.  Thesolution is well-clued to boot, clues that mean everything to the detectiveand nothing to youuntil the end when you fairly kick yourselfand, as in the best of Christie (of which this is a prime example), he does.  Congratulations to Mrs. Christie for constructing such a baffling and entertaining detective story.	2001-12-06

It is a long time since I enjoyed anything so much.\\"  That said, the book is perhaps not to everybody's taste, for, in this day and age of mindless sensationalism, who has time to read a book three times as long as the normal detective story, full of literary allusions, and with a wit and style all its own?  Those who do miss out, however, will be missing something, for this is one of the half-dozen best detective stories I have ever read.<br />The most noticeable thing about the book, apart from the extraordinary length, is the original idea at the core of the novel, the idea which is \\"just the sort that such books should have-something imaginatively convincing but not actually possible\\": the intrusion of the Spider into reality, escaping from the books of Mr. Richard Eliot into the books of Mr. Michael Innes, \\"the effect as if the inanimate-seeming husk of [Mr. Eliot's] books had trembled and cracked-and from the chrysalis there had struggled a living thing.\\"  This gimmick of \\"our own imaginings, our own stock-in-trade, being brought to bear against us\\" is completely unusual in detective fiction (although Innes would reuse it in Appleby's End and in Appleby's Answer)-and is completely successful, for the atmosphere created by a house \\"echoing to ambiguous sounds, to ditties of no tone which had existed hitherto only in the silent paraphrase of print\\" is memorable stuff.  Allied to this is the fascinating (and original) impossible \\"crime\\": how can the perpetrator of the deeds know of Eliot's discarded, unspoken, and unwritten ideas?  The play with the discarded ideas-medical hypnosis, telepathy, paramnesia, and metaphysics-is ingenious and well-sustained.<br />The plot itself is excellent, both highly complicated and lucid.  \\"Plots don't ramify; they thicken.  This plot thickens.  To an improbable, fatiguing Eliot-Spideresque degree.\\"  Innes keeps his balls in the air like a master juggler, continually posing challenges and riddles-and the reader, far from being fatigued, enjoys the entire farce.<br />The atmosphere is effectively menacing in an original way.  Unlike many stories where the reader spends the book impatient for the victim to be bumped off, the minor outrages create a feeling that \\"something is being worked up to.  A bastard artistic process.  And we haven't reached the climax yet.\\"-but that when the climax is reached, something dreadful is going to occur.  The later revelation that somebody is going to be a murderer, and somebody else a victim, allows for more complications and ingenuity, for Innes repeatedly poses the question of who victim and villain will be.  Suffice it to say that the reader will be unable to work out the puzzle, despite the fine clues provided.<br />The writing is flawless-no, better, it is simultaneously brilliant and perfect.  The literary wit could not be improved upon, even if most of the story seems to be taken up by a long series of highly entertaining digressions; the book is hilarious, and \\"the comedy [is] of the classical sort which is based on character\\", with Innes' characterisation equally flawless.  The bookishness is, as Innes points out, not a handicap-\\"rather it helped him to a useful critical control of the magic carpet, so that his contraptions of the sort flow straighter and cleaner than most.  And it gave him from the start a good deal of craft.  He had pondered Gulliver's Travels and knew that the best way to pass off an improbability is to set another improbability hard up against it.\\"<br />And, although the book is certainly improbable, it is such sheer delight that only a realist would complain.	2001-12-06

Although genuinely funny, with good dialogue, the plot is a mess.<br />The setting is Rome, vividly depicted, and seen through the eyes of a plebeian, with emphasis on the waterworks, \\"a vital state concern, and had been for centuries.  Its bureaucracy was an elaborate mycelium whose black tentacles crept right to the top\\", and on the bureaucratic complications of the aqueducts.  To these waterworks, someone is adding various pieces of human anatomy-gore, with much scope for black comedy.  It soon becomes apparent that the murders are linked to the many Roman Games, giving the informer hero Marcus Didius Falco \\"an excellent excuse to spend much of the next two months enjoying himself in the sporting arenas of our great city-all the while calling it work\\".  The atmosphere of \\"watching scores of gladiators being sliced up while the Emperor snored discreetly in his gilded box and the best pick-pockets in the world worked the crowds\\" is vivid and almost tangible.<br />Setting, therefore, is quite good (although certainly not comparable to the brilliant depiction of Rome in Robert Graves' superb I, CLAUDIUS).  What is not so good is the actual plot: the detection is not very good, with few clues to speak of, and no suspects; and the murderer's identity is a complete let-down, completely characterless, and introduced on page 231 of 294.  This is not what I expect from an author The Times suggested as being \\"well suited to assume ... the title Queen of the Historical Whodunnit\\".	2001-12-06
US	47307239	R1XCJECC9203CS	0061002798	974937155	The Clocks	Books	2	6	9	N	N	Review	The Clocks (1963) is late and average Agatha Christie, a rather mundane plot set in a rather mundane setting.  The setting is suburbia-Christie's exploration of changing times and social mores, but much better done than Third Girl.  Wilbraham Crescent, \\"a fantasy executed by a Victorian builder in the 1880's\\", is \\"a half-moon of double houses and gardens set back to back\\" in which \\"the houses were neat, prim, artistically balanced and eminently respectable\\".  Into the middle of this respectability is placed a dead body: a man, stabbed to death, the body discovered in a room filled with strange clocks in a house belonging to a blind woman.  \\"It seemed wildly unlikely that a man should be found murdered in her neat, austere house-but the unlikely happened more often than one would be disposed to believe,\\" reflects Detective Inspector Hardcastle.  However, the solution to this agreeable touch of fantasy is a great disappointment: a red herring with no relation to the plot other than to make things difficult.  The plot itself is mundane, although well-plotted, and with an excellent clue in the shape of a stiletto heel.  The characterisation is indifferent to poor, no character standing out, and the murderers' identities are not particularly interesting.  Detection is done mainly by police procedure, a bored Poirot acting as an armchair detective, reading detective stories (including John Dickson Carr and Freeman Wills Crofts, the latter under a pseudonym), and doing little else-the story is seen through the eyes of the disillusioned spy Colin Lamb, son of Poirot's old friend Superintendent Battle, a Carrian hero who falls in love with a girl who may be a murderess (...).  This then is a rather indifferent Christie, not bad, but not particularly good either.	2001-12-06
US	47307239	R2KV2WKF3AX1EC	0060810149	270087905	The Night of the Twelfth	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Review	Nothing epitomises the changes in the detective story more than a comparison between Nicholas Blake's A QUESTION OF PROOF (1935) and Michael Gilbert's THE NIGHT OF THE TWELFTH (1976).  Both are school stories, and in both the victims are children.  In Blake's book, a boy is strangled-brutally and quickly-and thrown into a haystack.  There is a credible reason behind the murder.  In Gilbert's book, on the other hand, the child is tortured to death-murder for sadism, and off-puttingly graphic, the author \\"speaking quietly and with a lack of emphasis which seemed to make the words he was speaking more horrible\\".<br />As the book progresses, however, the tone gets lighter and more humorous-it is worth putting up with the highly disturbing opening chapters to reach Gilbert's amusing and well-drawn depiction of a prep. school setting, with believable students, and entertaining depictions of lessons and of games.  One of the masters, Kenneth Manifold, is an undercover policeman, both keeping an eye on Jared Sacher, the son of the Israeli Ambassador, who could be under threat from the P.F.O., as \\"any servant of the Israeli State who lives or moves abroad is a target\\"; and attempting to discover which of the four well drawn masters is the sadistic murderer.  The theme of intrusion of violence into the secure world of childhood-almost a passing of age ritual, mirroring the problems of adolescence-is well handled without cliché: \\"There's violence everywhere in the world.  It's increasing and it will go on increasing.  Nobody who is young today can expect to go through his whole life without meeting violence.  By coincidence you have run up against it twice in the last few months.  It could be useful, or it could be harmful.  That depends on you.\\"  Gilbert sees schoolmasters as people who have never grown up, who have attempted to \\"lock the gate ... shut out the disturbing influences, and live for ever in an innocent cloud-cuckoo land among people who never grew up.\\"  Common problems of boarding schools crop up: corporal punishment is attacked as being \\"all bound up with sadism and sex\\"; while homosexuality / paedophilia is also ascribed to sadism.  Michael Gilbert memorably draws a relentless portrait of inhuman evil, bringing about an ending surprising, depressing, and disturbing, with a genuinely evil and horrifying murderer disclosed after a genuinely edge-of-the-seat chase, \\"a game of blindfold chess ... played across the board of the English countryside\\"; the one flaw being that the true villain does not get all he or she deserves.<br />Despite the emphasis on psychology and characterisation, Michael Gilbert-as much a master of the genre as Nicholas Blake-does not neglect detection or clueing.  The clues discovered by Ken Manifold relate directly to sadism, being clues of character and clues of opportunity; while those discovered through workmanlike police detection are believable and realistic clues.<br />An excellent school story, effortlessly combining the innocence of childhood with the depravity and cruelty of the adult world-one of his triumphs.	2001-12-06
US	47307239	R3LCGX9CJM2LH9	0425169219	627310548	Death in the Clouds	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Review	Death in the Clouds shows Christie's fascination for transport in its aeroplane setting, as well as her ability to concoct an unusual murder in a humorous vein-the ingenious solution ably reached by her famous Belgian sleuth, M. Hercule Poirot.<br />The murder is that of one Mme. Giselle, a Parisian moneylender-\\"a woman who enjoyed power; [who] had power ... [of] the type of hard-headed Frenchwoman who would never allow sentiment to affect her business interests; but [who] had the reputation of carrying on her profession with scrupulous honesty\\".  As such, she is one of Christie's power-hungry women: like Mrs. Boynton or Mrs. Doyle, the sort of woman who is usually murdered.  And the murder here is, as Inspector Japp, a \\"bit too sensational to be true.  I mean, blowpipes and poisoned darts in an aeroplane-well, it insults one's intelligence.\\"  And Christie, committing her murder with \\"native\\" (although she really means &quot;extremely foreign&quot;) darts tipped with the venom of the African boomslang snake, is satirising those writers-such as Edgar Wallace-who concoct sensationally silly murders-\\"the crudest detective story dodge coming out trumps!\\"  At the same time as she parodies, she also sets a most intriguing puzzle, for \\"the manner of the crime was one of unparalleled audacity.  In the full view of ten ... witnesses, the murderer had placed a blowpipe to his lips and sent the fatal dart on its murderous course through the air and no one had observed the act.  It seemed frankly incredible, but there was the evidence of the blowpipe, of the dart found on the floor, of the mark on the deceased's neck and of the medical evidence to show that, incredible or not, it had happened.\\"  A John Dickson Carr crime!<br />The detection in the case is ably done-straight-forward and solid, \\"proceed[ing] a step at a time, with order and method\\", and carried out on both sides of the Channel by the French and British police, Hercule Poirot intervening, and assisted by two not-too-bright young things, Jane Grey and Norman Gale, both passengers on the plane, whose romance is well done (although we can do without their list of likes and dislikes).  The three clues in the case are excellent, their meaning well hidden despite Poirot's stressing their importance, and the solution is an ingenious Chestertonian flourish.<br />Although this is not the best of the Poirot novels, it is an ingenious little puzzle, well-characterised, and amusing.  By the standards of most other authors, it would rank as a masterpiece; with Christie, it is only a \\"good\\" novel.	2001-12-06

It must be noted that the fine revelation of his true character is a genuine surprise.  Williams murderstabbed through the heart, most probably by one of his two wivesseems to coincide with a series of stabbing attacks carried out on men approaching, or approached by, young womenan extraordinary picture Budds story had created and one which appealed to his imagination.  The dark wet night, the knife flashing purposefully, even frenziedly, the girl running into the rain with a sack slung over her shoulder.  It was like an illustration in a fairy book of Andrew Lang, elusive, sinister, and other-worldly.  It transpires that these women are all members of the feminist organisation A.R.R.I.A., whose emblem is a raven woman [with] a face like Britannica or maybe Boadicea, one of those noble, handsome, courageous, fanatical faces, that made you feel like locking up the knives and reaching for the Valium.  It is the raven emblemand its followersthat gives the book its title, for ravens are not soft and submissive.  The collective noun for them is an unkindness.  An Unkindness of Ravens.  Appropriate, wouldnt you say?  In their attitude to the opposite sex anyway.  They stab at us with knives rather than beaks.  Despite her liberal politics, Rendell is clearly against extremism, although she makes the point that revolutionaries are always extreme.  Look at the Terror of 1793, look at Stalinism.  If they're not, if they compromise with liberalism, all their principles fizzle out and you're back with the status quo  Thats what's happened to the broader womens liberation movement. <br />Chief Inspector Wexford, as always, is actively detecting, showing his human side as well as his intelligence, as he tracks down clues and suspects, continually making comparisons to literature and to history.  Although the surprising ending, well-clued, shows Rendells interest in psychology, with terms such as solipsism, folie à deux, and Freudian seduction theory being tossed around with gay abandon, there is not too much psychology, even though Wexford feels he sounded like a psychotherapist, though any interrogating policeman was one of those, and Burdens familial problems do not intrude.<br />Quite simply, a modern classic of detective fiction, tense and gripping, a book genuinely unable to be put down.	2001-12-06

The characters are one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs, all actuated by some horrible form of revenge or sadism, and all plotting against each other, all two-faced (...). What little comedy there is, is black as the soul of the Moor Aaron: the comedy comes from the scene in which the Andronici are arguing over which of them will chop off their hand and send it to the Emperor; and from some of the worst lines in Shakespeare (...).

The characters who populate the typical country-house `The Hollow' are vivid and believable, motivated by love, jealousy, hatred or despair-but handled in a unique manner.  The most important character is the victim, Dr. John Christow, whose death is the centre point of the romantic triangles amongst the eccentric Angkatell family, and who is linked with three women, all in love with him, but in very different ways: his wife, Gerda; his mistress, Henrietta Savernake; and his former fiancée, Veronica Cray.  Naturally, the motive is jealousy, but the themes of love and jealousy are superbly handled.<br />The detective story elements are not, however, Christie's best.  The murder is quite simple-the murderer is obvious, but the circumstances, involving several guns and a painting of Ygdrasil, are inexplicable-and the entire thing is a reworking of LORD EDGWARE DIES.  Poirot is very much in the background, acting only as a deus ex machina at the end-it was a mistake, Christie later felt, to have him in the book.<br />The result: a beautiful yet somewhat flawed masterpiece.	2001-12-06
