US	52532871	R1SOG7Q8U9Y5UG	B0009PMOXW	425597726	Alistair Cooke's America	Books	5	11	13	N	N	A Book for All Thoughtful Americans	Alistair Cooke, who died very recently, was a Briton who first came to America during the dark days of the Great Depression as a very young BBC correspondent. The venerated justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was one of the very first people whom he met - and he writes eloquently of that encounter in the Civil War chapter of this book. Finding our spirit and our optimism contagious, Cooke spent much, if not most of his life here for the next seven decades, getting the know the best and the brightest, the celebrity and the common man on the street, learned about our history with an appreciation that very few - even many Americans - have for this country.    The result is \\"Alistair Cooke's America\\" first published as a loving tribute to this country at its Bicentennial in 1976, with a revised forward in 2002, though with no mention of the tumultous events of September 11, 2001. Cooke writes movingly of our history and of the spirit of the American people, the fight for Liberty during the American Revolution, the move westward, that \\"firebell in the night\\" (to quote Thomas Jefferson) as the country tore itself apart over the question of Slavery. He writes of the Civil War, interestingly considering Antietam to be a much more significant battle than Gettysburg. His views on Abraham Lincoln are also surprising, in his view that President Lincoln was venerated in great part due to his death, and being the leader of the winning side.    Cooke also spends much more writing space on Woodrow Wilson, whom he clearly admires for his domestic and foreign policies,  but either ignores or just wasn't aware of Wilson's Racist policies. By contrast, Theodore Roosevelt, whose Presidency bridged the gap between the Civil War years and America becoming a major power, gets barely two pages.    Cooke's chapter on the \\"Arsenal of Democracy\\" is a revelatory look at how America's policy of \\"Lend Lease\\" and our subsequent entry into World War II did save the world from Hitlerism, especially when France had fallen and Britain was on the ropes.    Despite some of his views, or perhaps because of them - This well-written and profusely illustrated book deserves the five-star review because Alistair Cooke wrote a history that belongs on every thoughtful American's bookshelf alongside Stephen Ambrose's \\"To America\\". The things we take for granted about how great this country is were never missed by this great British writer.	2005-10-09
US	52532871	RFLZ2QJ7QNLU6	0743228286	531331883	The Bob Dylan Scrapbook, 1956-1966	Books	5	11	14	N	N	A Fascinating, Hands-On Keepsake of the Dylan Experience	\\"The Bob Dylan Scrapbook, 1956-1966\\" has been described as a companion volume to \\"No Direction Home\\", and it is  - but it is also so much more. While the Scorsese documentary is now being shown on PBS, this scrapbook is a hands-on readable documentary of the Dylan experience. It chronicles his early days in Minnesota, then his drifting off to the folk clubs and coffee houses of the New York City scene, the friendships with Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie and others, and those subsequent hits recorded by him and by Peter, Paul and Mary - \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\", \\"Don't Think Twice\\", \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" - and finally Dylan's decision to go electric - no doubt inspired by the Beatles, the Byrds who took his songs and made Folk-Rock classics with them, but also by a young Scot who sounded very much like Dylan and had already added electric guitars to his folk sound, namely Donovan Leitch. The book, like the film, ends with Dylan's controversal decision to go electric with a bunch of guys from Canada and Arkansas - the famous Band, the performance at Newport and the tour of Britain, and the impact of Dylan's changing sound (\\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", \\"Rainy Day Women 12 & 35\\")on the not-so-happy folk purists as well as the enthused rock and rollers.    Throughout the pages Dylan emerges as a complex man and musician, but surprisingly human - humorous, quite funny and not as political or serious as he has been portrayed as in the past.     I am disappointed just a bit by the altogether brief mention of the Byrds in this scrapbook - one or two pages, and not even the famous photo of Dylan onstage with them at Ciro's as \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" became a monster hit, but this is more than compensated by the pullout lyrics, the imagery, and the flaps chronicling those wonderous times. This book is a coffee table gem for the Dylan admirer.	2005-10-06

Unlike most works on the Arnhem battle, Powell, who was a company commander in the British \\"Red Beret\\" paratroopers who fought there, gives the reader the full scope of the campaign - not just the battle for Arnhem bridge. <br /> <br />He chronciles the bitter strife between the Allied commanders involved - not only Montgomery versus Eisenhower but within First Allied Airborne Army, between the American Air Force General, Lewis Brereton, an \\"odd choice\\" to command this Airborne Army, capable but with the shadow of the destruction of his command in the Phillipines at the beginning of the war hanging over him, and with his deputy, the brilliant but irascible British General Frederick \\"Boy\\" Browning, who as a genius in Airborne warfare had never actually fought in an Airborne engagement! Pressured by the quick Allied advance into France and the Low Countries after D-Day, Brereton and Browning kept planning airborne operations that were stopped at the last minute by Allied successes on the ground, Brereton and Browning clashed bitterly, and at one point the high-strung Browning (husband of \\"Rebecca\\" novelist Daphne DuMaurier)submitted his resignation - but chose to stay on. <br /> <br />Then Montgomery came up with his plan to secure the Rhine Bridges in Holland and open the gates into Germany's Ruhr - Operation Market-Garden. Browning became an enthusiastic proponent of this, in no small part for finally unleashing his trained and beloved 1st British Airborne Division into battle. (its sister division, 6th Airborne, had already seen combat on D-Day as chronicled in Stephen Ambrose's \\"Pegasus Bridge\\") The normally cautious Browning failed to heed or take seriously all warnings including one from his chief intelligence officer, Major Brian Urquhart (later Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations) that the Germans, far from beaten, had brought tanks into the Arnhem area, Thus, as thousands of brave, enthusiastic British and American paratroopers prepared for battle, a tragedy was already in the works. <br /> <br />Powell surprisingly is not as critical of Browning as are other British participants, including the Arnhem field commander, the late John Frost are. Colonel Frost (later a Major General in the British Army) was wounded and captured along with the majority of his command trapped alongside the Arnhem bridge by German tanks and infantry. His only criticisms of Browning is for taking his battalion-sized headquarters into Holland at the Groesebeek Heights outside the town of Nijmegen, where the American 82nd Airborne had landed and were more successful than the British were, however suffering extremely heavy casualties. Powell felt that Browning, desirious to see combat, should have stayed in Britain and directed the battle from there, including further drops by Polish paratroopers and the subsequent relief effort. Being \\"on the ground\\" in the midst of it all could not and did not give Browning an overall sense of the fight. Otherwise Powell's criticisms of Browning are mild compared to other Airborne personnel - including Frost who bitterly writes how Browning told airborne commanders - Arnhem Bridge - take that, and then went on to say to the Americans - and seize Groesebeek Heights. <br /> <br />General John \\"Shan\\" Hackett, a great British Military Historian who was also one of the 1st Airborne Battalion commanders, was wounded and narrowly evaded capture in the confusing, swirling battles that marked the aftermath of the failure to take Arnhem Bridge has rightfully credited Powell with writing a full book about the full campaign, including the splendid contributions of the American paratroopers of Jim Gavin's 82nd Airborne and Max Taylor's 101st, who did achieve their objectives albeit with heavy casualties; and of the efforts of the Polish Airborne, who tried to relieve their British comrades - wishing though thatthey had been deployed over Warsaw instead of the Dutch countryside. The Polish commander, a very experienced officer who had fought the Nazis in the battle of Warsaw and had escaped via the underground to France, had constantly warned Browning about \\"the Germans, General, the Germans\\" and had been rewarded with being dismissed from command following the debacle. <br /> <br />If not the best book written on the scope of the Arnhem campaign, Powell's book is indeed the best one written by an active \\"Red Beret\\" participant of \\"The Bridge Too Far\\". <br /> <br />	2005-10-06

Or Paul Jones, (Paul who?) or the great untold stories of the Stones?    For example, when Mick Taylor chose to bottom out - in some ways a survival instinct, since brilliant guitarist Taylor was well on his way to emulating his predecessor, the late Mr. Jones, Keith Richards, who always had an eye for suggesting those whose appetites rivalled his, enthusiastically suggested Stevie Marriott to replace Taylor. Marriott having just left Humble Pie. Marriott, himself an excellent showman and strong vocalist - he had been a child actor in his youth - came to the Stones' rehearsal, cautioned by Richards to not get too exuberant - otherwise Mick would feel threatened!     Well, Marriott stayed low-key for awhile, going through a couple of songs with Mick and Keith, the gigging was going great, and then screamin' Steve's basic instincts of stealing the show got the best of him - and he started wailin' as those of us who were fortunate to see Humble Pie live in concert know so well. Well, to make a long story short, Mick got angry, felt threatened, and alledgedly told his \\"glimmer twin\\" - NO MARRIOTT!     So after going through the motions with American guitarists Harvey Mandel of Canned Heat and Wayne Perkins, and even considering Badfinger's Joey Molland, Mick and Keith settled on Ronnie. Considering Keith's ill-starred friendship with Gram Parsons - also appetite, or shall we say, pharamecutical related, one can only wonder what a Stones' front-line of Jagger, Richards, Marriott could have been like.    I don't believe Mr. Davis' covers this episode in his book; or also notes that the Stones - namely Brian, actually considered Paul Jones, then known as Paul Pond, or \\"permanently pissed Pond\\" to be their original lead vocalist. For those not in the know, Paul Jones (not Zep's John Paul Jones) became the immensely popular vocalist of Manfred Mann (\\"Do Wah Diddy\\", \\"Pretty Flamingo\\"), and then went on to brilliant careers as a leading man on the London stage in Andrew LloydWebber musicals, including the first \\"Evita\\" soundtrack, and as a respected and formidable Blues man - his Blues Band, and the reformed (without Manfred Mann) Manfreds are very successful in Britain today, though alas, not in the U.S. - Jones may not be as famous as Mick is, but he remains a very popular and genial figure in Britain. But yes, Paul Jones almost beat out Mick for the Stones' lead singer position. Oh, how pop history might have been different.    And yes, Mr. Jagger may seem flamboyant and wicked on stage; offstage his love of history - he's reading a bio of \\"Mao\\" according to the London Daily Telegraph; his appreciation of the knighthood, and his strong believe in discipline - he dressed down Keith's buddy Gram Parsons for hanging around the Stones too much when he should have been recording with his own Flying Burrito Brothers, speak volumes about his own multi-faceted character. Not that he is the role model for the perfect spouse - lol, or parent, but that there is so much more to Mick than what meets the eye, while Keith still looks like (if he no longer acts like) a southern-fried chicken!	2005-10-05
US	52532871	R1T7ZVUL2KNU53	0385507380	386669978	Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times	Books	5	38	47	N	N	Andy Jackson -  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly	And unlike open admirers like Remini and Schlesinger, H.W. Brands should be given credit for presenting the man as he was. <br /> <br />Most of us with any sense of American History know that Jackson routed the British in the last major military engagement of the War of 1812 - the Battle of New Orleans, fought actually two weeks after the war ended. Most of us know what a capable and determined President he was, Professor Brands sheds light on the things that we either do not know or know little about. <br /> <br />For example: <br /> <br />Thanks to Andrew Jackson, we have a Bank of America but NOT a Bank of the United States! There was actually a national bank whose power became too all-consuming. Jackson closed that bank, allowing open competition to flourish.  <br /> <br />Jackson was extremely popular not just as a war hero, but as a common man - reared on the then-frontier of the Carolinas and Tennessee, rough sown territories where men would settle accounts by duels, where children were often the product of illegitimate relations, and where hate of the Indians and of Blacks flourished. Jackson was a product of the backwoods, shared many of their prejudices, and tended to alienate friends as much as he did foes. For example, Davey Crockett was a valued scout and soldier in Jackson's war against the Creeks - and a friend to boot. That friendship ended when Jackson cruelly chose to force the expulsion of peaceful Cherokees along with the Creeks to the Oklahoma territory. The then Whig Congressman Crockett stood firmly and bravely against President Jackson's \\"Treaty of Tears\\" policies - and ended up ousted by Jackson's cronies in the following election. Crockett of course is better known for his subsequent death at the Alamo than for his gallant stand against Jackson's anti-Indian policies in Congress. <br /> <br />Another friend who had unease over Jackson's hate of Indians was Sam Houston, who actually went to live with the Cherokees following the scandal thaterupted over his wife's desertion of him when he was governor of Tennessee. But Houston chose political expediency over standing up to Jackson, and kept mum - and in Andy's good graces. <br /> <br />Jackson's hate of Indians came out of his hate of the British, who killed members of his family, indirectly caused his mother's death tending to American prisoners-of-war on a British prison ship (she took ill and died due to exposure and neglect), and his own experience as a teenager when refusing to shine the boots of a British officer was slashed almost to the bone by the officer's sword in the bitter, backwoods fighting in the Carolinas. But fighting armed warriors is one thing; expelling peaceful citizens is quite another, as well as defying the Supreme Court's Chief Justice John Marshall who sought to prevent the Cherokee expulsions. In one of his more infamous statements, Jackson asserted that \\"John Marshall made the law. Now let him enforce it\\". Of course a modern day President might have faced impeachment, but not Andrew Jackson.  <br /> <br />Jackson also held the Racist views of his time - promising, then going back on his word, the freedom of slaves who fought alongside American soldiers in the Battle of New Orleans. As a Southerner and Slaveowner, Jackson was sympathetic to the States' Rights of the South - but to his everlasting credit, he did put the preservation of the Union first over territorial rights, and was willing, as Professor Brands notes in much of the book, to stand firm and even threaten the South with military force. His main antagonist during the 1832 secession crisis was not only another old friend but his own then-Vice President, John C. Calhoun, who favored secession - and stood down when Jackson threatened to send Winfield Scott and the United States Army down to Charleston. <br /> <br />Jackson's firmness prevented South Carolina from seceding in 1832, and in doing so, kept the rest of the South in line. But his pro-south policies otherwise, including his fervent wish for the annexation of Texas would only mean trouble ahead for the future and weak Presidents such as Pierce and Buchanan. <br /> <br />As one reviewer stated, Professor Brands does not have the narrative gifts of a David McCullough. In fact, his \\"T.R.\\" bio came up far short to McCullough's biography of Roosevelt's early years - \\"Mornings on Horseback\\". But he does give us an excellent biography of Jackson that does give us a full picture of the man - and does include the Racist and mean-spirited warts and all.	2005-10-05

First and foremost, it is a worthy companion to the novels of Louis L'Amour, and sheds historical light on his fictional west. While I loved \\"How The West Was Won\\" - one of the very first movies besides Clint Walker's \\"Yellowstone Kelly\\" that I ever went to see, Mr. Wexler's book brings the Rawlings family, particularly Zeb and Linus into proper historical perspective. He also does the same for the famous Sackett characters, and others like \\"Utah Blaine\\" here as well. <br /> <br />Secondly, it is a coffee table book filled with artifacts, paintings and graphic images of those who fought for, settled, and left their mark on the West - the good, the bad, and yep, the ugly too. Wexler might have provided a stronger narrative on the Indian and the Wars for the Plains and the Desert; he did not. Those wonderful sepia toned photos of Cowboys on the plains are also conspiciously lacking; and I'm surprised he was so minimal when it came to discussing Buffalo Bill Cody. There are no discussion nor imagery of the great scout's \\"Wild West Shows\\" - but then again, the old Colonel never really passed through Mr. L'Amour's novels. <br /> <br />Wyatt Earp and the dynasty of Western Outlaws, plus women of the west, good and bad, proper and soiled get their due; there are also fine photos of the gambling tables, the scout's gear and acroutments, the ghost towns. If you already have coffee table books on \\"Western History\\" then there's not much difference about this one from the others save the homage to Mr. L'Amour...but for the Western History beginner, or for someone who would love a good and new coffee table Western History book, this slim volume makes an purdy awesome book. <br /> <br />\\"The Wild, Wild West of Louis L'Amour\\" is also a companion book accompanying the wonderful new \\"Guns and Gamblers\\" exhibit at the Desert Caballeros Western Museum in Wickenburg, Arizona.	2005-10-04
US	52532871	RKZ2QQR1GIUM5	078581597X	249673113	Two Roads to Sumter: Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis and the March to the Civil War	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Lincoln and Davis - A Brilliant Study In Contrasts	By the Grand Master of American Historians, the late Bruce Catton and his son William. <br /> <br />In \\"Two Roads to Sumter\\" the Cattons brilliantly analyze how the Kentucky roots of both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis molded their character and their Allegiance to the Union, but also why those two great men chose to walk down different roads in the quest of keeping the United States united. <br /> <br />Always thought of as a kind, gentle man - which he indeed was, Lincoln nonetheless emerges from the Catton work as someone in the Sam Waterston (himself a Lincoln admirer of great standing) lawyer role on \\"Law and Order\\" - passionate, yet a pragmatist - and someone who was willing to compromise as he was to stand firm on principle. Lincoln detested Slavery, and was willing to do all he could to preserve the Union - but he chose to be pragmatic in those crucial, fatal months between the outcome of the 1860 election and the firing on Fort Sumter - staying quiet up to the inauguration, and appearing to be uncertain in those last two months before Beauregard gave the order to open fire. David Detzer in \\"Allegiance\\" has criticized the great man for this approach, submitting to the reader that a Jacksonian approach to the South might have prevented war. <br /> <br />But - it might have forced the \\"war hawks\\" hands much sooner, and that point is well taken by the Cattons. Their premise is that the South was ready and willing to go to war - and might have felt that way from the Kansas-Nebraska Act on. Unlike Detzer, the Cattons applaud Lincoln for staying the course, and being the brave and true man he was. <br /> <br />By contrast Jefferson Davis - who was described by Sam Houston as being as \\"ambitious as Lucifer\\" - and with his pointed beard even bore a sad resemblance to him, comes off better than he has at the hands of other historians. The Cattons were among the first to show that while Davis was uncompromising in his views on Slavery and state's rights, he was afervent believer in the Union who unlike Lincoln had actually shed blood in battle for this nation. They describe his outstanding tenure as Secretary of War in Franklin Pierce's administration; his role in the Gadsen Purchase, in establishing the Camel Corps, in urging the building of railroads across the country. In all this Davis took the high road of country first, region second, even if he was also bettering the South. <br /> <br />When push came to shove however, Lincoln chose the Union, while Davis eventually became an uncompromising acolyte of secession and the south as a separate entity, even if his initial decision to leave the U.S. Senate and declare for a Confederacy was a reluctant one. <br /> <br />An immensely readable history of the story of two Americans - Lincoln and Davis, and the events leading up to the Civil War. To be placed alongside the three great titles on Secession and Fort Sumter - Detzer's \\"Allegiance\\"; Swanberg's \\"First Blood\\", and Klein's \\"Days of Defiance\\".	2005-10-04

My problem with this book is while I do agree with Ms. Crier about the EXTREME Right - Ms. Crier only sticks it to the one side, NOT to the EXTREME LEFT judges like Marianna Pfaelzer in California who deliberately spat on the views of the voters who passed Proposition 187 - including over 50% Hispanic-Americans who felt ILLEGAL Immigration was not only a violation of American laws but also a serious drain on the economic infrastructure of California. Or to others on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court, including the equally LEFTIST hubby of the ACLU's Queen Bee Ramona Ripston, who has almost always skewered the law to the liking of the Left's constituency.    That court just declared that the Pledge of Alleigance is \\"unconstitutional\\" because a self-proclaimed atheist has a problem with the word God in it. Catherine, where are you? Did you say the pledge when you were a child in Texas?  What is wrong with reciting our fealty to our country?     What is Constitutional, Catherine? Is it strictly for judges who see nothing wrong in Illegal Immigration? Or doing away with the Pledge of Alleigance because it offends the non-believer; Is it for judges who wish to accord terrorists who come to slit our throats the rights of prisoners-of-war? (which they are assuredly NOT). Is the Constitution strictly for judges and their supporters who have a problem with any kind of religious display - whether it be a Chabad Menorah on the occasion of Hanukkah or a Cross shining down from a desert mountaintop? (and for those Left Fascists who only feel that the law applies to them and not to all, and are ready to throw their brickbats, well, I'm not a religious person myself, but I respect the rights of those who are - as well as our Judeo-Christian ethic) Even the seal of the County of Los Angeles must be changed because there is a little cross within that seal that offends the Left Fascists of the ACLU? Are they members of the Extreme Right, Catherine Crier?    Miss Crier can make all kinds ofreferences to Judge Greer and the Schiavo case - but Catherine, not one reference to the Taliban-like behavior of the ACLU in regard to the L.A. County Seal, or to Ms. Pfaelzer's hobnail boot treatment of the voters of California. Heck, she ignores this as she'd rather freak out over the judge in Alabama and the Ten Commandments!    Celebrity Judge Crier (whom was once considered for the Supreme Court by the current President's father) is taken aback by the outrage demonstrated towards Judge Greer, who blithely ignored the parental feelings and rights of Terri Schiavo's parents in favor of the \\"thumbs down\\" decision by an ex-husband who had abandoned her. This is her opening shots in her new book. Would she have felt the same if a Judge had said the same thing about Christopher Reeve?     Miss Crier is concerned, and maybe justly so, about extremist and fundamentalist judges on the far right - but in her quest to go \\"Hollyweird\\"  she has become so blind in her ignorance of the terrible excesses of those on the far left.  This one-time Republican judge is about as fair and partial as Arianna Huffington, which is to say not at all. If you can only denounce the extreme right - and not those who has squashed our rights, our liberties, and our laws on the EXTREME LEFT - then you are wrong, Catherine.     Our nation is equally at peril from those \\"activists\\" who on the extreme Left and ACLU wish to legislate their warped agenda on morality, ethics, security and law on the American public as it is from the fundamentalists. Miss Cathy just doesn't get it. Worth a casual look-see in the library or bookshop, but not worth a continental otherwise.	2005-10-04

From Valmy in 1792, where a French Revolutionary Army stopped the disciplined, well-trained Prussians in their tracks to the Croat rout (with U.S. help) of the Serbs in Krajina in 1995, Newark has spotlighted the men, the commanders, and the material used to turn defeat into victory. The maps are detailed, and to his credit he also uses brief statements by those who fought in those battles, or by other military historians. Waterloo, Gettysburg (a slight disappointment, as Newkirk ignores Lee's decision to go north, or provides much detail about the fierce fighting of the Second Day), San Juan Hill, Gallipoli, Midway, Stalingrad, Inchon, the Six Day War and Desert Storm are all here, as are the colonial battles that either brought decline or doomed the great empires - Isandlwana, the Brusilov Offensive (1916) in which my grandfather participated in, in what should have been a clear-cut Russian victory but only accelerated the collapse of Tsarist Russia, Singapore, and Dienbienphu.    There are some interesting inclusions, including the 1881 battle of Geok Tepe, where the armies of the Tsar crushed Islamic rule and brought nearly 100 years of Russian and Soviet domination to the peoples of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, and the battles of Port Stanley (the Falklands War of 1982) and Kabul (1988) - no, not the American liberation of Afghanistan but when the Afghan resistance drove the Soviets out, only to squander the new-born freedom to inter-tribal feuding and the rise of Islamofascism in the form of the Taliban and Bin Laden.    But St. Lo? Or Tarawa?    Missing? Well, there are a few battles that I might have included. Vicksburg, which effectively denied the Mississippi to the Confederacy, Jutland, where the German High Seas Fleet was forced back into its anchorage even after sinking moreBritish ships; to me, Arnhem was also significant due to the gallant stand of those gallant British paras in their Red Berets, though perhaps not exactly a decisive battle. More of a last stand, alongside the Little Big Horn and the Alamo, though with more survivors. Jutland may have been deleted simply for the fact that the Germans chose unrestricted submarine warfare - but that alone would have been decisive in the fact that going that route brought the Americans, angry over the sinking of the \\"Lusitania\\" into the conflict.    Also - the book was published in the late 1990s - well before 9/11 or the fight against Islamic terror in both Afghanistan and Iraq.     Still, for a rich, comprehensive, nicely illustrated and very reasonable (amazon's affiliate Borders has plenty of copies - stick to the \\"paperback\\" one - the cover graphics are much more striking) history of decisive battles by a gifted contemporary historian, this book is a must in the homes of afficianados of military history or in the public library.	2005-09-06

More of a last stand, alongside the Little Big Horn and the Alamo, though with more survivors. Jutland may have been deleted simply for the fact that the Germans chose unrestricted submarine warfare - but that alone would have been decisive in the fact that going that route brought the Americans, angry over the sinking of the \\"Lusitania\\" into the conflict. <br /> <br />Also - the book was published in the late 1990s - well before 9/11 or the fight against Islamic terror in both Afghanistan and Iraq.  <br /> <br />Still, for a rich, comprehensive, nicely illustrated and very reasonable (amazon's affiliate Borders has plenty of copies - stick to the \\"paperback\\" one - the cover graphics are much more striking) history of decisive battles by a gifted contemporary historian, this book is a must in the homes of afficianados of military history or in the public library.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-06

While I am not finished with it yet I have found it to be a very enthralling read, a crackling narrative that does not overwhelm the reader.    While I still quite haven't figured out where Ferguson actually stands, whether he is a closet Tory or an apologist for Blair and \\"New Labour\\", what is clear is that he does not have the guilt trip about colonialism or the British Empire most current British historians such as the Communist Hobswam and others suffer from.    \\"Because of Empire....\\" Ferguson cites how his family learned to appreciate other cultures; or how some moved away from Scotland and found a better life in Canada. \\"Because of Empire....\\" the English language, the Rule of Law, Seafaring Trade, benefitted the world, and gave rise to the world's great democracies - America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Famous names are liberally sprinkled throughout this work. The Self-Destructive Clive, the Good and Giving Livingston, the unscrupulous Stanley, whom Ferguson brusquely describes as being an American (he was, for part of his life, but British at the beginning and end of it) Disraeli, Gordon of Khartoum, Kipling, Rhodes, Smuts, Kitchener, Lawrence and Churchill.    He also brings up those not so well known. Fanning, the North Carolina woodsman and diehard Loyalist; Macquarie, the governor of Australia who ruled over his convict colony with compassion and giving the wretched a chance to build new lives; Bogle - the original \\"bogeyman\\" whose revolt against British rule in Jamaica led to several reprisals. Indeed, Ferguson doesn't spare the excesses - he writes frankly of the British role in the Slave Trade (for example, the Reverend who composed \\"Amazing Grace\\" was a notorious slaver - EVEN after he wrote that song), of Indians being strapped to cannon and blown to bits in the Mutiny of 1857 (this however, after the Indians savagely slaughtered innocent British women and children after the garrison of Cawnpore surrendered); of the slaughter of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population (here Ferguson does try to make an apology that really doesn't hold water,i.e., that British administrators did try to uphold the rights of the Aborigines while American ones treated our Native Americans with deliberate callousness and cruelty); and of the forced deportations, slaughters and oppression of those who resisted British rule in Africa and Asia. Ferguson acknowledges the excesses, but also forcibly points out the benefits and the progress made in these subjugated countries thanks to British rule.*     Ferguson also interestingly refers to the American Revolution as being our first Civil War, and considering the thousands who flocked to Loyalist regiments in New York and the Carolinas, or people like the aforementioned Fanning, or Benjamin Franklin's own son William, the Loyalist governor of New Jersey, and finally the thousands who fled to Canada following Yorktown and preserved the survival of British Canada, he does have a strong point here.    Ferguson also points out that by the 1930s, even with the threat of Hitler, the British had become largely apathetic about their Empire - on one hand beginning to see colonial rule as a liability, but waxing nostalgic - see the \\"English Pudding Menu\\" designed by the King's chef and including exotic fruits and spices from India, Jamaica, Ceylon and elsewhere (without those ingredients this would be a tasteless pudding of doemstic old bread crumbs and old beer) - they were downright hesitant to give up the Empire even as internal and external pressures increased.    Another reviewers claims that Ferguson believed that the British sacrificed their Empire during World War II for the common good. I'm not so sure about this, but what is known is that the British forces sent to garrison Singapore were equipped with outdated aircraft (Brewster Buffalos, ancient Vildebeeste torpedo bombers, and a scant number of Hurricanes against the Japanese Zeros and Mitsubishi bombers), no tanks, not enough artillery, and outside of the Australian forces and the late arrival of the 18th division - which arrived only in time to end up \\"in the bag\\", second- and third rate troops. Also - a scant naval force of one Battleship, one Battle Cruiser (both quickly sunk)and a half-dozen destroyers to face the might of Imperial Japan. So, again, Ferguson may have another point here.    *For those who wish to push the guilt trip - the apologies for Colonialism, I would ask them to carefully read about what is happening in Zimbawbe, the Sudan, and South Africa since the British left. Or about the resurgence of infantcide and the ritual murder of women in India and Pakistan. Then try to elaborately discuss why the British Empire was so evil; while unscrupulous, murderous native rule is not.     Better yet, take another look at \\"Empire\\".	2005-08-28

However, I am, like President Lincoln, \\"vacillating\\"...vacillating between continuing to read this book or returning it to the bookstore.    Why?    To begin with, while I don't doubt the integrity of Mr. Guttridge, a very good historian, there are too many things here - unresolved issues, unconnected dots, that don't hold water. The authors claim that Lincoln authorized a \\"meat-for-cotton\\" deal to save the Union financial structure. Fine, if one considers that if Lincoln truly needed the cotton, he would have authorized another \\"Red River\\" expedition headed by someone more militarily astute than Nathaniel Commissary Banks. He would not have agreed on a financial deal to save the Union based on Confederate cotton.    Secondly, Andrew Johnson's chief aide? Relations were already bad between Johnson and some of the other alledged co-conspirators (Edwin Stanton, et. al.,) that why would they want someone affiliated with the detested Johnson to run the show. And bringing in John Wilkes Booth, a blatant Confederate symp and hater of Lincoln to be part of the team? C'mon.    John Wilkes Booth was, according to nearly every account that I've read, never married. If he was, where's the proof. On the other hand, women like the relative of Senator Sumner who tried to distance herself from any association with him, or the poor beautiful actress who tried to kill herself after her lover murdered the President are much more numerous and much more known.     As for Lafayette Baker and Stanton, sure, these were very powerful and yes, very despicable men. But this deal to kidnap Lincoln when he vacillated on the deal, preferring, according to the book a decisive military victory, simply is too unwieldly - and there would have been too many people who would have spilled the beans, no matter who might have been involved. General Grant allowing Lincoln to bekidnapped or murdered - and Lew Wallace described as being close to Grant??? Anyone who has read about Grant's anger towards Wallace after Shiloh would have known better, even if Wallace did get back into Grant's good graces after his valiant one-day stand at Monocacy against Jubal Early.     Finally, John Wilkes Booth being smuggled out of the country to India, courtesy of Stanton. This is just too rich for me.     A good conspiracy call,  - but just too unwieldly, too unbelieveable, even if Stanton was involved up to his armpits. I'll leave it to some of my friends who are Lincoln experts to sort this thing out.    Were Leonard Guttridge and Ray Neff playing a joke on all of us??    Has the DNA been checked yet???	2005-08-28

I remember reading stories of Americans, mainly servicemen, who disappeared behind the Iron Curtain following World War II. To the everlasting shame of every single President from Truman to the current occupant of the White House, we have never demanded a full accounting of their fates, not even from so-called \\"Democratic\\" Russia. <br /> <br />Burrows story is a sad, despairing one, of brave men who flew their reconnaisance aircraft over hostile, yes, enemy airspace without fighter jet protection, and often encountered Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean MiG fighters. He writes of that very first aircrew shot down over the Baltic in April 1950, roughly two months before the Korean War. Harry Truman, revered by so many, did absolutely nothing about it even though US Navy life rafts, filled with machine gun holes, were seen drifting off the Swedish coasts.  <br /> <br />When the Korean War broke out, Truman refused to bomb the Chinese Army that massed along the Yalu but continued to send these unarmed planes deep into Chinese and Russian Far East airspace. The pilots who did come back would talk about flying over those eerie mountains and crystal blue lakes of Manchuria and Siberia, always on the lookout for enemy jets, and fearfully knowing that if met, they didn't stand a chance. Even if the planes were close to Japanese airspace that didn't stop the Soviets from blasting them out of the sky. One such flight was blasted out of the sky in 1952, just off the coast of Northern Japan. But instead of U.S. jets scrambling to help the crew, or U.S. Navy ships at full speed trying to rescue them - there were destroyers of the Soviet navy on-hand. Some of the American airmen seen parachuting into the sea were believed to have been picked up by these Russian ships, never to be seen again. <br /> <br /> Most of these flights ended with the advent of satellites and the downing of Gary Powers' U-2 in May 1960. But Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon (although he did try to get a full accounting of missing U.S. personnel in Vietnam), Ford, Carter, Reagan, and even Bush and Clinton after the Soviet empire finally collapsed never even bothered to get a full accounting of what happened to these men. Only after former Soviet officers presented the widows, sons and daughters with personal items of men shot down off the Soviet coast did some word of these secret missions and the fate of these men come out - and not for all. <br /> <br />When a \\"friend\\" of the United States like Boris Yeltsin can rewarded a savage American traitor and Fascist like the late spy Morris Cohen with the Hero of Russia award, then it is time that we press our elected officials to demand a full accounting - and if any might still be alive a release of these American servicemen who gave their all for this country. Otherwise, what are we doing rescuing their sailors?	2005-08-24

A guy who went down to Nicaragua to endorse the Sandinistas, only to have those Marxist thugs make a fool of him by curtailing the liberties of the trampled Nicaraguan people.

The Chamberlain one has been pointed out, and in Ted Alexander's essay on the first Union soldier to die at Gettysburg, he points out that a Cpl. William Rihl of the New York Lincoln Cavalry was killed at Fleming's farm on June 22, 1863 in action with Jenkins' Confederate Cavalry.    On the other hand, the masterful Noah Andre Trudeau in his: \\"Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage\\" notes that Private George Sandoe, of Captain Robert Bell's Pennsylvania cavalry squadron, was the first to die at Gettysburg, killed on the 26th,on the town's western outskirts, while valiantly trying to stop the onslaught of Lige White's cavalry, attached to John Gordon's division of Jubal Early's corps.    I have always been intrigued by the story of Bell's little cavalry squadron, which tried to stop Gordon's initial march into the town, and was scattered for its efforts. Bell and his men seem to drop off the pages of history, save for Trudeau's work.    Eicher also seems to subscribe to the same criticisms of Alfred Pleasonton (the Union Cavalry commander)that Edward Longacre, and more recent historians have seem to suggest. Still Pleasonton performed very capably and competent when he was allowed to by Meade. Meade didn't like cavalry, and as an engineer officer inspecting and improving lighthouses along America's eastern coast before the war, had developed a dislike for Pleasonton's father, a government bureacrat. Simply stated, Pleasonton didn't not have the slack that Phil Sheridan had, later on, under Grant. Eicher also suggests that the doomed Elon Farnsworth never received his Brigadier General commission when he was killed in Kilpatrick's senseless cavalry charge in the vicinity of the Round Tops immediately following Pickett's repulse. When nearly all other sources, including Longacre, suggested that he had.    The Cavalry actions on the third day are as usual, minimally covered. The brisk fight between Custer and Stuart so recently well-covered in Tom Carhart's \\"Last Triumph\\" at least rates an two-page essay. The Farnsworth charge only merits two paragraphs.    Eicher was wise to invite fellow Civil War Historians to provide a number of very well-written essays, and while all of them are exceptional, the beginning one written by James McPherson, arguably our greatest living historian, is a compelling one that urges all Americans who love their history to visit the Gettysburg Battlefield and get that sense of what is was like then.    Photograph choices are very, very good. Some of Eicher's photographs could have easily been taken by anyone with a Kodak instamatic and a good printer, but overall they still convey very well the now as opposed to the then. Many of the \\"old\\" photographs collected seem to have been printed with a deliberately \\"grainy\\" image - note the photo of Buford and his staff, or the remarkable one of Lee near the beginning of the book. I happen to like the effect; some other readers might not.    Well-worth it as an addition to your Civil War bookshelf if purchased at amazon's nice bargain price, and as another reviewer said, would blend in well if you have artifacts of the battle, as I do. Still, I wouldn't pay the full or the paperback price.	2005-07-29

A Tour of Presidential Gravesites	Books	5	4	7	N	N	This Is A Fun Read, & Much More Reasonable than Sarah Vowell	Brian Lamb and his C-SPAN team have written a number of wonderful and extremely-informative essay-filled booknotes on American History and Characters. \\"Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb\\" is no exception.    With contributions from Douglas Brinkley, Richard Norton Smith, and other noted Historians, this compact, easy-to-read volume is filled with vignettes and facts about all of the  deceased Presidents, their last days, presumably their last words, and where they are buried. Admission prices to their libraries and museums (and this includes living Presidents and Jefferson Davis too) is also included.    Brinkley's insightful essay at the end of the book, in which he writes with great eloquence of the attachment of Springfield Illinois to Abraham Lincoln, and of his visits to other Presidential gravesites and museums is almost worth half of the price of this bargain edition.    Note: This book was published prior to the passing of President Reagan, yet it does note where he wished to be buried, and has information about the Reagan Presidential Library and Museum.    The book shows the human and humorous side of the Presidents, including Calvin Coolidge's funny comment to a woman who said she'd bet him if he would say two words (\\"You Lose\\", was Silent Cal's response), or how William Howard Taft, a Unitarian, deftly fought back against religious prejudice.    A solid and fun read, especially around the July 4th holiday, and at 4.99 is a much better buy, and totally devoid of  political commentary ala Sarah Vowell's weak-at-the-knees \\"Assassination Vacation\\".	2005-07-06

Of special interest are the sections of very rare correspondence of American servicemen during the War of 1812. The effects of war are clearly seen in the correspondence of one American volunteer, who enlisted enthusiastically at first, then experienced the horror of battle, including the death of the beloved Army General and Noted Explorer Zebulon Pike (\\"Pike's Peak) at the battle of York (1813). At the end, suffering from dysentry, all that this young soldier wants is to be reunited with his family.  <br /> <br />There is a 20 page section of Civil War correspondence that includes letters from Stonewall Jackson to his wife, and a blunt missive from William Tecumseh Sherman to the Mayor of Atlanta, as well as the poignant Sullivan Ballou letter penned before the first Manassas battle. <br /> <br />There is also much correspondence of British servicemen, from the Revolution up through Waterloo, and the two World Wars, including an interesting note sent to Churchill from a public servant asking him what the Two World Wars should be referred to as.  <br /> <br />There is also a difficult letter to read from a doomed German soldier at Stalingrad. No matter what one thinks of the German war machine, or hates all that Hitler and Nazism were about, this German officer, knowing he will not be going home alive, frankly writes his wife that \\"Hitler has left us in the lurch\\" and \\"we will not be taken alive\\". <br /> <br />The photographs, paintings, and correspondence are all well-chosen, and better yet, this book can be obtained through the amazon.com affiliate Borders in their brick stores on the bargain tables no less at a very nice price!

Manning Force was an officer in the Union Army that moved south into Tennessee at the beginning of the Civil War. This army was involved in the fighting at Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, the carnage at Shiloh, and finally entered Northern Mississippi at Corinth - which began the initial phase of the march on Vicksburg.    Force later went on to serve under Sherman at Atlanta, and during Hood's desperate counterattacks was gravely wounded. However he survived and later became a prominent judge and politician in his native Ohio.    Along with a number of other former Union Civil War officers, Force helped write the multi-volume \\"Campaigns of the Civil War\\" series in the early and mid-1880s. The series became extremely popular with that generation which was beginning to forget about the Civil War.    Even after over 20 years, General Force was able to provide his reads with a sense of the scope of Grant's plans in the spring of 1862. He also sheds light on the operations and generalship of John Pope, who was then a rising star in the Union Army by his successes at New Madrid, Island Number 10, and Corinth - only to fail fast when he went east to confront Bobby Lee later that year. Here Force shows that Pope was NOT the braggart or ne'er do well later Civil War histories made him out to be, as his campaigns along the Mississippi were just as successful as Grant's were, though he faced considerably less resistance.    Force honorably sheds light too, on Grant's opposite - the well-respected and reluctant Confederate Major General Albert Sidney Johnston, quoting much from the late General's son's biography. Forced south after the fall of Fort Donelson, Johnston turned around and surprised Grant at Shiloh Church (Pittsburg Landing) only to be mortally wounded in a description by Force that is pretty terse rather than the dramatic tales of how he could have lived had a tourniquet been applied. With Johnston's death, and the arrival of Union reinforcements, the Confederate surge collapsed - and the Union armies was able to clear western Tennessee and North Mississippi of their foe. With his military experience, General Force was able to illuminate much of the action and tactics involved during this major battle as well as the other campaigns mentioned in this work.    This reprint has the original tiny lettering and ink maps of the period, so it may be a bit difficult to read, as all of the books in this series are. Still, it is a major account of the Shiloh Campaign, and a wonderful addition by a former serving officer in the Civil War enthusiast's bookshelf.	2005-06-25

Among my treasured possessions is an 1898 \\"Wild West Show\\" programme, and a cabinet card of his photograph. I am still hoping to get an actual autograph but that's another story.    This is the first biography of Buffalo Bill to be published in many years, unless one counts the beautiful pictorial by R. L. Wilson, \\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show\\", which essentially was more of a catalog of Wild West show items than a full-length Cody biography. The gifted McMurtry of \\"Lonesome Dove\\" and \\"Buffalo Gals\\" fame (one of his books provided the name for one of my favorite bands - \\"Desert Rose\\")has not only given us a new biography of Buffalo Bill but sensibly combined it with one of Annie Oakley as well.    For the most part, McMurtry's skills as a captivating, gripping, novelist works well here. The chapter on Bill's efforts to try and save his good friend Sitting Bull at the time of the Ghost Dance Uprising is an extremely dramatic one, even though readers familiar with the subject know what the dreadful end will be. He also provides an balanced, easy to follow narrative on the Indian Wars, and what made the Wild West Shows so extremely popular (of course centered around the personalities of the \\"Colonel\\", the Little Queen, and the Cowboys and Indians who joined them)     Buffalo Bill Cody is also presented as the larger-than-life persona he was - warts and all. Hard drinking, womanizer, frontier hero and valiant scout...and failed businessman at the end.    Ironically though, it is McMurtry's consummate skills as a novelist that is my only problem with his fine work. This technique can sometimes be just as distracting as it is meant to captivate the audience. For example, are his meandering into non-sensible quotes by Ned Rorem, and taking novelist's liberties with this dual biography. Another novelist, Michael Korda, sensibly avoided this, though barely with his concise biography of U.S. Grant - perhaps McMurtry should have been more concise, stayedon the historical track, but maintained his rich, high quality writing in that sense. He cannot nor should be faulted for giving us a fine work on a great man - or for his open admiration for both Bill and Annie.	2005-06-19

No, Lee won't defeat Grant, so if that burst anyone's bubble, sorry.    BUT...    to paraphase the Australian scientist John Osborne in another alt-history classic, the horrific \\"On The Beach\\": \\"we may not win, but it is fun finding out\\", so it is with the final volume of Gingrich's Civil War alt-history trilogy.    Grant is faced with a daunting task - how to defeat Lee's victorious army, which, thanks to the recklessness of Dan Sickles, not only has once again shattered a barely rebuilt Army of the Potomac, but is also once again on the verge of marching on Washington, D.C.    Instead of turning North to defend the capital, Grant marches south, towards Richmond, and an alarmed Lee is forced to retreat back into Maryland to face the Northern threat. Grant, knowing that it is Lee's army that holds the key to ending the war, not the Confederate capital, sends the dashing George Armstrong Custer north to smash Rebel railroads (a new character) while sending his own Cavalry commander, Benjamin Grierson, to deal with Jeb Stuart.    Custer does accomplish his objective of smashing the B&O railroad, denying much needed supplies from reaching Lee, but ends up meeting an early demise, not on the banks of the Little Big Horn, but those of the Monocacy, in Maryland - NOT Montana.     Grant also resurrects a mini-Army of the Potomac, and sends it forward under a new commander, George Sykes, one of the few Union officers who survived Sickles' debacle at Gunpowder Falls. \\"Old\\" characters thought dead are also resurrected - namely Winfield Scott Hancock and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. Grant, closing in from one end and Sykes coming in from the other on an increasingly disillusioned Lee, catch up with the Confederates. An epic battle shapes up along the banks of the Monocacy, just miles away from the nation's capital - but where's that author of \\"Ben Hur\\" - General Lew Wallace this time around? (he fought that real battle of Monocacy in July 1864)    The end may be inevitable, but the twists sure ain't! -  \\"Never Call Retreat\\" remains a fun, gripping, and great Alt-History read!	2005-06-07

If for the ability of a trained engineer it need not be so. <br /> <br />But the engineer at the helm of the United States in 1857 was the weak, lilly-livered, effeminate James Buchanan. Northern by birth, never by sentiment, Buchanan not only gravitated towards, but bent over backwards to appease the South. He had no sympathy towards the poor Black Slave, and was coarse towards those who even urged the Slave Power to moderate. <br /> <br /> The prominent members of his cabinet, Howell Cobb of Georgia, Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, and John Floyd of Virginia, all future Confederates were essentially running the show - with Jeff Davis lurking in the background. When the Southerners or Slave Power howled, Jemmy Buchanan jumped. <br /> <br />When it came time for Buchanan to take a stand, as in the case of backing his hand-picked governor for the Kansas Territory, the able Robert Walker of Mississippi, who, though Southern born was Unionist in heart and mind, and urged that the people of Kansas decide whether or not slavery be allowed in that ravaged territory, Buchanan quickly repudiated him and adopted the Slave Lecompton Constitution.His own friends denounced him, and even the blinders began to fall off the pliant Northerners in his cabinet, men like the willing but old Secretary of State Lewis Cass and Buchanan's own sidekick, Attorney General Jere Black.  <br /> <br />From then it was all downhill towards Secession and Sumter - save for the courageous stand of Stephen Douglas, and the rise, rise, and steady rise of Douglas' rival in Illinois, a backwoods lawyer by the name of Abraham Lincoln. Nevins adroitly covers the famed Lincoln-Douglas debates and their affect on the nation as it was tearing itself apart. <br /> <br />There are plenty of moments of high drama throughout this history, for example, in the first pages when Nevins conjures up the horror and bloodshed of the forthcoming Civil War, and tries to convey that if Senators had any idea of what was to come, they would either have allowed the South to secede, or they would have acted resolute earlier. Instead they - and the country got Jemmy Buchanan. And War. <br /> <br />While this is but one volume of a two-volume set, these books can and do stand alone on their own merits.	2005-05-28

Having escaped from American custody, the embittered Rogers turned around and offered his services to the British. <br /> <br />So, you're asking - WHO WAS ROBERT ROGERS??? <br /> <br />Ever hear of the Green Berets or the Rangers? Robert Rogers, American-born and bred, was the \\"grandpappy\\" of our current Rangers and Green Berets. His \\"Roger's Rangers\\" almost singlehandedly stopped the French and Indian atrocities on our Northeastern frontier during the French and Indian Wars. He was also active in putting down \\"Pontiac's Rebellion\\" and suggested a \\"Northwest Passage\\" to the Pacific 40 years before Lewis and Clark. <br /> <br />By 1763, the exploits and career of Rogers had eclipsed those of his fellow American Washington's. So why his fall from grace and obscurity? <br /> <br />Well, I hope David McCullough would have addressed this. Rogers had a dark side.He gambled much, he drank copious amounts of liquor, he was a womanizer, and he was rude and crude - a woodsman who did not have Washington's education or diplomatic skills. His debts landed him in prison time and time again. At the time of Lexington and Concord, he was in a British prison. He got back to America, and almost immediately offered his services to Washington and the Continental Army. Instead, Washington threw Rogers in jail under the suspicion of being a British agent. Rogers escaped, and ended up forming Tory Ranger units fighting against his countrymen three years before Benedict Arnold turned traitor. Embittered, dissolute, heavily into drink and debt, Rogers left America with the retreating British at the end of the Revolution, and died a pauper in London, a decade after Yorktown. <br /> <br />One recent biography of Rogers by John Cuneo mentions Washington's antipathy towards Rogers but offers little more. So why did a Washington, who along with the Continental Congress overlooked the inadequacies of Arthur St. Clair, Horatio Gates and Charles Lee, all ex-British Army officers who incompetently led American troops during the Revolution (Washington, in a famous episode even \\"chewed out\\" Lee after he botched the Monmouth battle)rejected a Rogers whose skills were well-known and respected. Could Washington have been jealous? <br /> <br />(* an aside: Richard Montgomery, the only British General who came over to us and whose star may have shone brilliantly, was killed in the doomed assault on Quebec that might have brought Canada into the United States. McCullough only mentions Montgomery once, in a message sent to Washington informing him of Montgomery's death) <br /> <br />This is something I would have expected David McCullough to investigate, research, and address, and I am disappointed that after \\"Mornings on Horseback\\" and \\"John Adams\\" he did not do so. <br /> <br />He mentions that Israel Putnam was brave almost reckless combat general but unskilled in leading large formations of men. Why? Was the scheming Charles Lee any better? and why no mention - unless I missed it, of Benedict Arnold and Valcour Island?  <br /> <br />McCullough has written a solid history of - THE TIMES THAT TRIED MENS SOULS - a book that deserves its place on the shelf of those who collect American Histories. I just wished that he would have added more. <br /> <br />Any contact information for Mr. McCullough?	2005-05-25

Still he captures the essence of the American Cowboy in that brief period between the end of the Civil War and the beginning years of the 20th Century. Using archival photos by Charlie Belden, L.A.Huffman, and others, and coupling it with a splendid but terse essay, Collins adequately captures the life and the spirit of the American Cowboy; the cattle drives, the chuckwagon, the campfires, the loneliness,the ranch life, the joys and sorrows,including the extremely sad photo of a large group of cowboys surrounding the gravesite of a dead pardner. This last photo is even more poignant when one considers that even when that photograph was taken, the time of the individualistic cowboy riding the open range itself was coming to an end.    A beautiful coffee-table book for anyone who loves the history of the cowboys or for those who wanted to know what it was like back then between the opening of the trails and the closing down of the frontier. Mr. Collins' book, coupled with renowned photographer Jay Dusard's works of contemporary images of cowboys, would make an awesome two-pack gift for all who wished they could be a Hoppy, Gene, Roy, or Teddy Blue Abbott and Andy Adams.	2005-05-16

He became President as American power asserted itself on the world scene, and died just after the end of the First World War.    David McCullough has always been an outstanding Historian with a gift to present History in a narrative form that is relatively easy for his readers to follow. IMHO I think he outdid himself more so on \\"Mornings on Horseback\\" than he did on \\"Truman\\" or even the well-received \\"John Adams\\". This being said even though it is NOT a complete biography of TR.    For McCullough provides the reader with the goods of what made TR - Teddy what he later became. A father whom he loved greatly, yet always seemed disappointed in him for not having served the Union cause during the Civil War.(TR Senior did help the Union War effort, but in great part due to the pressure of his very pro-Confederate wife never served in the Union Army though he wanted to, and regretted not doing so) A mother with Southern views - her brothers - TR's Uncles James and Irvine Bulloch served with distinction in the Confederate Navy; the former U.S. Navy officer James as the procurer of blockade runners and ironclad warships from Britain for the Confederacy; Irvine as an officer on board one of those ships - the fearsome CSS \\"Alabama\\". TR's later interest in building up the U.S. Navy when he became President came in great part from idolizing the seafaring exploits of his Confederate Navy uncles.    Theodore himself was a sickly boy who nearly died of asthma and other diseases as a child. Somewhere along the line he built himself up, excelled at boxing, went on to Harvard, sparred in a literary sense with Jefferson Davis, became a bestselling author - and went on to be a power broker on the New York Republican Party scene. He also went out West and became a Cowboy - capturing outlaws and other badmen, raising cattle on the Montana Badlands - and faced down a hotheaded, obnoxious French bigot by the name of the Marquis De Mores.    Indeed the chapter (\\"Glory Days\\") on Roosevelt's life as a happy Cowboy in Montana as the Old West began to fade are the most appealing and enduring of McCullough's classic biography.    Placed together with Pringle's Pulitzer Prize winning biography, this is a Teddy biography that belongs on the bookshelves of all who are interested in TR's life - or in those times that followed the Civil War as America - and Theodore Roosevelt - matured.	2005-05-11

While a lot of Merde can be expected from the French, the Germans and the Arabs* (see below) Gibson also takes aim at the Brit haters of America - who unsurprisingly are equally anti-Semitic (and probably anti-Christian too). Gibson's pen is clearly aimed at ingrates like the self-loather and so-called Playwright Harold Pinter who gave a hoary hate-America lecture on the eve of 9/11 and then stood by his words even after 3000 innocent human beings were murdered by the Islamofascists.    Of course in his hate of America and endorsements of terrorist sycophants like George Galloway, Pinter convienently seems to forget that if it weren't for Winston Churchill (if he hates Blair, you can imagine what he thought of Churchill), the fighter pilots of the RAF, and maybe a couple hundred thousand American soldiers, Harold Pinter would have been a lampshade in some obengruppenfuhrer's living room.    But like Noam Chomsky, Pinter identifies himself more with the Fascists and the America-haters than with his \\"own\\".    Gibson also points the finger at others in the so-called British Intelligensia, people like Margaret Drabble, and those in Tony Blair's own Labour Party, like Robin Cook, a hypocrite and self-server who resigned from Blair's cabinet because he was more in tune with the Islamofascists than with the British people. Gibson, in a pointed reminder of what Margaret Thatcher told President George H.W. Bush, has shown that the Brits themselves have gone \\"wobbly\\" time after time when confronted with Islamic terrorism and have sought Munich-style appeasement.    Gibson should have the cheers of all good thinking Americans when he takes on the *Germans, the Russians, and the Arabs. He makes sure in his work that the shadows of Hitler, Stalin, the Saddams, the Arafats, and the Osamas are pushed to the forefront when he points out how the German Social Democrats, particularly their Baader-Meinhof thug ofa Foreign Minister will blame America when he refuses to confront not only his own shady past, but also the Hitler era. But hey, it is always nice to compare a George W. Bush to Adolf Hitler, especially when Bush is a strong supporter of Israel - and Hitler, well, he killed six million Jews.     Or when the author shows how the so-called Arab Intelligensia, or those who should be promulugating freedom and democracy in the Arab world - are in the forefront of the Hate America - and 9/11 served us right. His portrayal of that Egyptian professor is especially illuminating. And unlike our President, Gibson is NOT confident that the Arab world, especially the Palestinians are ready for reform - let alone democracy.    As for the French, Gibson skewers them like the kababs they've become. Like others he brings up the two World Wars and the thousands of American bodies that fertilized French soil to save the ingrates so that greedy Vichyites like Chirac who love Arab petrodollars much more than Liberty, Freedom, Equalty, can turn their country into a haven for those who would bring France down for the third (or fourth, or fifth) time.    I recently had a chance to peruse through this book at an airport bookshop, and at amazon's more than fair bargain price, it is worth reading - and thinking about.    Thank Goodness and God Bless Susie from Australia. It is shocking and even chilling to note how many Americans seem to despise their own country and consider us, like the subjects Gibson has written so well about, to be the evil in the world. Ted from NYC who is particularly vitrolic doesn't seem to mind - or get it - that an Al Zarqari would have no problems hacking off the neck of a guy whose last name is Feldman even if he were so willing as to kiss Yasser Arafat's corpse pinkie ring.    Has America done wrong things? Sure. But do we owe up to our warts and all? ABSOLUTELY! I'd like to see the Europeans who TOLERATED Hitler and Stalin and now tolerate the Al Qaeda Mosquesin Britain and France do the same. Or owe up to their collaborations with evil over the centuries. I think you'd find our record pretty clean compared to theirs - and that too is a message Mr. Gibson conveys so well.	2005-05-10

I had first heard of Berga and the 350 American GI's - Jewish - but in many cases not, who were herded by the Nazis into the Berga camp on a PBS special last year - and my reaction was shock, anger, but even admiration - NOT for the Nazis but for that gallant German-American Captain who not only defied the Gestapo by refusing to turn over his Jewish personnel but tried to escape several times.  <br /> <br />There have been stories - even other books written about Jewish-Americans, GIs but also in some cases civilians who were swept into the Third Reich by Hitler's advancing armies.This is the first history of how Americans faced firsthand the Holocaust by a mainstream publisher. While men like Erwin Rommel chose not to differentiate between Jews and Non-Jewish POWs; there were others, including those involved in the Bulge operation who chose to do so. The 350 prisoners at Berga were captured at the Bulge, where the Nazis were known to have committed atrocities en masse - the Malmedy Massacre against unarmed American POWs - and Belgian civilians nearby. <br /> <br />While more fortunate than their compatriots butchered by the SS Monster Peiper at the Malmedy crossroads, at least 70 of the Americans - Jews and Non-Jews alike, perished from starvation, exposure - and execution - at the Berga camp. The Americans too, came face-to-face with the horror of Hitler's extermination program, as they were placed in close promixity to starved, slaved Russian and Polish Jews who were also at Berga. <br /> <br />When the survivors were liberated they were told to keep silent, and worse, Berga ended up in the Soviet zone - and notwithstanding the Soviet's intense hatred of the Nazis - they chose NOT to expose what happened at Berga - after all, to the Russians they were only ZHIDS - and the Russkies too wanted the former Nazis on board with them to fight us in the Cold War. That is NO excuse however,for our government, especially in the face of Eisenhower's hatred of Nazism, to cover over the atrocities committed against AMERICAN GIs at Berga. <br /> <br />Roger Cohen has given us a history that while is appalling - is one that needs wide-exposure, as our GREATEST GENERATION is dying out and anti-Semitism is again rearing its ugly head. The stories of the brave Captain aforementioned; and of the individual Americans who stood up to the bestality of Nazism deserves to be placed in every American school and library.	2005-05-10

After all, Joe Lieberman has practically nothing in common with the Kerry-Clinton-Carter-Byrd MOVEON.ORG mindset that has taken over the Democratic Party lock, stock and barrel, yet he has chosen to grin and bear it - even when those who dominate his party *&%$#@ all over him. <br /> <br />Zell Miller had had enough. He had had enough of the Democratic Party's tepid response to terrorism, to all of the warnings Clinton had about Osama Bin Laden, and his decision to ignore them. He had had enough of a people whose moral fibre lies with those like the Kennedys and the Clintons - or those who would spare (and rightly so) a Christopher Reeve yet put thumbs down on a Terri Schiavo.  <br /> <br />He knew that those who tolerated and even applauded the likes of a Klansman like Robert Byrd would scream blue murder and resort to lies and a smear campaign over his supposed Racism of four decades ago, yet Zell Miller, ex-Marine and Patriot chose not only to support President Bush, but to also tell it like it is - in \\"A National Party No More\\" - and now this, \\"A Deficit of Decency\\" where he not only retells his reasons why he supported President Bush and chose to vote with the Republicans - but how he endured a hate-filled campaign from those who once shared the same party - though not the same patriotism, Zell Miller has. <br /> <br />Miller pulls no punches - for those who chose to send me their obscenity-filled tirades over my criticism of Richard Clarke, Miller also points out the salient and blatant fact that Clarke had all of the Clinton years to fix the Intelligence mess and act upon the warnings that we were going to get hit and hit hard by Bin Laden. But either he chose not to - or his bimbo-loving boss chose to ignore his findings, and that is something, Miller comments, that Mr. Clarke - and Mrssrs. Clinton and Kerry need to own up to.  <br /> <br />Miller also points out the dismal voting record of John Kerry - a man who chose opportunism and disarmament over the necessary security needs of our nation. <br /> <br />A solid, no punches-pulled work from a man who chose duty, honor and country over a party that has largely abandoned those ideals.	2005-05-05

As a longtime lecturer on the Civil War and specifically on the use of cavalry at Gettysburg I have always commented over the lack of solid, good histories on that so-called \\"fierce sideshow\\" that took place at the East Cavalry Battlefield on the afternoon of July 3rd 1863!    Bruce Catton, the late esteemed expert on the Civil War only mentioned that the cavalry was there - and Henry Steele Commager's Civil War Almanac doesn't even mention the cavalry action that afternoon at all!    Sure, Edward Longacre and Eric Wittenberg have written books, but they're more generally known to the Civil War enthusiast community; Noah Andre Trudeau and Jeffrey Wert have written exciting glimpses and passages of the two cavalry actions that afternoon (the other being Kilpatrick's misguided actions against the Confederate flank on the South Cavalry battlefield) but no full-length books.    Now Tom Carhart has presented all Civil War buffs - and all who enjoy a good, crackling History liberally sprinkled not only with \\"What Ifs\\" - but how those what ifs would have been implemented.     For Mr. Carhart is the first historian to push out of the mist and put all of the pieces together to show how Lee did have a clear concise plan at Gettysburg - to use Jeb Stuart's cavalry to break through the Union screen along Culp's Hill and come down swinging in the Union rear while Pickett's infantry advanced against the Union center at the same time!  Thanks however to that guy whose flamboyant uniform made him look like a \\"circus rider gone mad\\" - a guy by the name of Custer - Jeb Stuart and his Confederate cavalry were stopped dead in their tracks amidst that cry of \\"Come On You Wolverines\\".  Yet somehow Custer's valiant stand at Rummel's Farm was almost totally ignored in the drama that took place 3 miles away.    To Tom Carhart's credit he has put all of the pieces together in a narrative that is easy on the eyes and easy to follow. Only wish he had provided illustrations as there are some pretty dramatic scenes from that melee on East Cavalry field - a melee whose greater importance is finally realized in \\"Lost Triumph\\".    Damn I wish I had written this book!	2005-05-05

When I first read about Sarah Vowell's book on visiting the assassination and burial sites of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley and Kennedy, I was quite eager to get a copy. I have many books on the murder of Abraham Lincoln and it is an episode of American History that often brings tears to my eyes. I too have read much on McKinley and his assassination, and have personnally visited the tombs of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy in my lifetime.    However when I read Ms. Vowell's comparison of Theodore Roosevelt to Paul Wolfowitz, and in a manner disparaging to both gentleman, I quickly put the book down and walked away. It is one thing to write a emotive, pathos-filled work on the assassination of four of our most beloved Presidents (whether or not you liked them), it is quite another to put your own political perspective in such a work. In her anger at the U.S. War in Iraq - and taking a swipe at the decision to go to war with Spain in 1898, Ms. Vowell has chosen the deplorable latter over what could have been a major historical accomplishment.    The reasons why we went to war with Spain were honorable ones, whether or not the U.S.S. Maine was sunk by the Spaniards.    Did Ms. Vowell ever hear of the \\"Virginius\\"? or of Weyler and the Concentration Camps??? She even takes a swipe at the heroism of the Rough Riders!!!    Buy the Bishop and Manchester books on the Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations, or Margaret Leach's insightful bio of McKinley.     By far the best book on the assassination Lincoln besides the works written by Jim Bishop and Carl Sandburg is the pictorial history -\\"Twenty Days\\" by the Kunhardts.

Davis in perhaps his best work outside of \\"Lincoln's Men\\". <br /> <br />Unlike \\"Look Away\\" or the two biographies penned by Davis on the two central subjects of this book - Jefferson Davis and former U.S. Vice President-turned Confederate General-turned Confederate Secretary of War John C. Breckenridge, this work concentrates on the last days of the Confederate government, fleeing from Richmond as Lee's final defenses crumble before Grant's all-out assault after the Five Forks debacle. <br /> <br />On one hand you have Jefferson Davis, devoid of all reality even as he flees the falling Confederate capital, exhorting the shattered, destroyed armies to fight on even as Lee's starving men are stumbling into Appomattox Court House, or as Johnston is all but cornered in North Carolina. Davis, Judah Benjamin, and a few other sycophantic souls seem to think the Confederate Armies in Texas and the Transmississippi will fight on till victory. <br /> <br />Then there is the realist and reluctant secessionist but gifted general Breckenridge. Even as he was appointed Confederate Secretary of War, Breckenridge knows the war is all but lost. He urges Lee to send him reports on the true status of the Confederate Armies - and subtlely but firmly urges Davis to come to grips. \\"Let us not end this with a farce\\" he tells Davis as the Confederate government leaves Richmond for the last time. <br /> <br />The true dramatic scenes are in the first half of the book when Davis, attending church the morning following Sheridan's crushing defeat of Pickett at Five Forks, is handed a note from Lee, saying Richmond can no longer be held. Davis quietly gets up from his pew, and walks out of the church, followed slowly by other members of the Confederate government. The congregants slowly realize what is happening and they too, shocked and in a daze walk out even though the minister is still trying to conduct his service! (Jay Winik also retells this tale in APRIL 1865). The government boards a special train bound for Danville on the Virginia border with North Carolina - hoping to meet up with General Johnston's Army of the Tennessee. <br /> <br />The Danville days - where Davis does act like an Adolf Hitler or Saddam Hussein - though not necessarily as evil as they were - exhorts the disspirited folks of southern Virginia and North Carolina to fight on, sends out orders to units that no longer exist, with all of the cabinet realizing they were in danger of being killed or captured by Union Cavalry operating nearby, is probably the most gripping part of the book. Also the flight of Breckenridge from Richmond, and his irregular contacts with Lee, up to two days before the surrender. In fact, Davis sends out scouts that reach a village 12 miles from Appomattox on the morning of Lee's meeting with Grant. Hoping to find the Army of Northern Virginia nearby, they find Breckenridge instead, who, along with Rosser's brigade of cavalry that barely escaped the Union pincers, tell these envoys from Davis the terrible truth that Lee, instead of fighting on, is on the verge of meeting with Grant. As Breckenridge proceeds south with the scouts from Davis, he tells them that he has heard no gunfire from Appomattox that morning of April 9th, even though they are scant miles away from Lee. <br /> <br />Those days in Danville must have been very surrealistic. Especially when Davis refuses to accept the fact that Lee would surrender. But the fog suddenly wears off - with the news that Johnston too, with Breckenridge's support, has entered into surrender negotiations with Sherman. How Davis could even think that Johnston, and his associate commander Pierre Gustave Tourant Beauregard, both of who detested him, would squander the lives of their men just to keep him in temporary power is mind boggling to say the least. <br /> <br />The book slows down its pace following Johnston's surrender, and the assasination of Lincoln, with only bits and spurtsof it a pick up in the successful flight of Breckenridge and his immediate party to Cuba. The capture of Davis by Wilson's cavalry, a tale retold too many times, is just an anti-climatical read here. <br /> <br />And while Davis doesn't cover the final battles in the Transmississippi, or the surrenders of Forrest, Kirby-Smith, Taylor and others, what he does cover here he does so in an exciting, fast-paced narrative. A great Civil War work about the end of the Confederacy - overshadowed by the landscape of Winik's outstanding APRIL 1865.	2005-04-21

TREASON - and while we might not have been at war with North Vietnam - a mistake that the JFK-LBJ Democrats gave us - she took her celebrity and her fame and money and spit on America and on better men and women than she'll ever be. <br /> <br />Jane Fonda was and is a traitor. Sorry, but if you can't accept that, then go and place flowers on that empty boot at West Point.  <br /> <br />And speaking of atrocities. What about the atrocities those whom she supported - and still supports - committed in Cambodia and in Vietnam. Oh yeah, Janey cries that the \\"hard liners\\" took over. Either she is really stupid - or really crass or both. It would have made NO difference in that kind of totalitarian society who took over...they still would have murdered or shoved opponents into concentration camps. <br /> <br />And this is the accomplishment of the Holzers. Not only do they point out the reasons why Janey - pretty as she is - is as bad as Benedict or John Wilkes, and document it thoroughly - but why she should have spent hard time in prison rather than making movies in Hollyweird. <br /> <br />A better buy than her tales of threesomes with perverts like Vadim, or subsequent hangouts with the fellow traitor Hayden and whooping it up (and insulting Native Americans) with Teddy the Yacht Boy.	2005-04-16

Dole spent several years alone in surgery and rehabiliation, something that is not commonly known to those who call him a \\"right wing wacko\\".

But consider this - the average American is spending two-three hours in airports going through all kinds of checks for even a domestic flight nowadays...and so far no major Muslim-American has denounced Islamic Terrorism. None. <br /> <br />And he's also dead on rights regarding prosecution of  moveon.org, or the neo-Fascist wing of the Democratic Party.  <br /> <br />Michael Savage may be shrill and cocksure at times - but the man does the research, does the work - and is usually right.	2005-04-02

The man who wrote and sang \\"I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better\\", \\"Tried So Hard\\", \\"Train Leaves Here This Morning\\" (with Bernie Leadon), and \\"Set You Free This Time\\". A very sensitive man, he was also extremely self-destructive. He had wrestled with demons throughout his brief life. The opportunities that came his way he either squandered or didn't take advantage of. Leaving the Byrds early on proved to be a terrible career move that he never really did recover from.    Furthermore, through his copious use of booze, he always seemed to rub those who could help his career, the hollyweird starmaking machine, the wrong way. Angered by some of his actions, David Geffen for example refused to promote his wonderful \\"No Other\\" recording. A drunken Clark also shocked another, more sympathetic record mogul by telling him to \\"f\\" his wife in front of him at a very well-known Hollywood restaurant!    The photograph of the once-healthy and strong Clark on page 305 taken right before he died speaks volumes. No, he didn't have AIDS, but alcohol disease made him look as if he had.    John Einarson wrote a compelling, well-researched, very sad story of a good man who couldn't handle things. Essential for all Byrds fans - with contributions by Chris Hillman, John York, and Bernie Leadon, among others, including members of Gene Clark's family.	2005-04-01

First Lerone Bennett, who in a book full of falsehoods, lies, and opinions tried to label Abraham Lincoln a \\"Racist\\".<br /><br />Now, C.A. Tripp, who is no longer with us to share his \\"wonderful beliefs\\" says that the evidence proves Lincoln to be Gay, or at least Bisexual because he shared a bunk with men.<br /><br />HELLO!<br /><br />I don't know if C.A. Tripp was Gay himself - and wanted to make Lincoln a \\"Gay\\" icon. Just like countless Hollyweird biographers are still trying to label Randolph Scott Gay because he shared a house with Cary Grant and were friendly towards each other.<br />HELLO AGAIN - they ended their lives as happily married men with children...<br /><br />The fact of the matter is this: During the 19th Century and into the 20th Century men in rooming houses and cabins often did share bunks and beds, and cowboys out in the plains huddled together in sleeping bags in the extreme cold. There was NOTHING sexual or \\"dirty\\" about that.<br /><br />Also, yes, Lincoln was awkward around women. Many men who grew up on the frontier, and remember, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky were the frontier at the beginning of the 19th century, were awkward around women. And he did enjoy the company of men. So What!<br /><br />Tripp could have made a very compelling case - as many others have over the weak and effeminate James Buchanan. But this is nothing more than innuendo and a nasty swipe at our most beloved President. Don't bother with this - do yourself a big favor and buy a copy of \\"The Eloquent President\\" instead.	2005-03-31

NOT	You might be saying that this is a subject Bruce Catton covered so well in his Civil War trilogy about - yes, the Army of the Potomac which culminated in \\"A Stillness at Appomattox\\".<br /><br />What is significant in what Wert does, however, is that he sheds light on things that Catton didn't cover, and with hindsight has also provided a more human perspective on the commanders of Lincoln's army in the east.<br /><br />Example - Wert describes Lincoln's frustration and anger at George McClellan following the battle of Second Manassas, yet allowed McClellan to resume command of the army, if only for the battle of Antietam and a short time thereafter because the soldiers were in McClellan's pocket.<br /><br />Example - it is Wert, not Catton who elaborates why William French was such a lousy corps commander who should have been removed at the time of Gettysburg. Meade kept him on - but soon found to his dismay how incompetent French was when the hard-drinking incompetent muffed a chance for a major Union victory at Mine Run. One of the stories Wert describes is of a soldier in French's corps who upon hearing that French took a bullet in his cap wistfully wished that the bullet had gone down two inches...it would have filled him and many of his fellow soldiers with joy.<br /><br />Wert also sheds light on the Meade-Sickles controversy, and why Lincoln, however pleased with Meade's command of the Gettysburg battle was subsequently displeased when Meade failed to follow up and trap Lee at the Potomac. Meade's cause was not helped when he tried to endorse a monument to former Army commander  McClellan over the strenuous objections of Lincoln. Wert also discusses why Grant endorsed Meade's desire to get rid of Cavalry Commander Alfred Pleasanton, but why Meade wasn't thrilled with Grant's choice of Phil Sheridan to replace him.<br /><br />All of the major commanders, the campaigns and battles, and even the common soldier are covered in this work in an easy narrative and index of 560 pages. Maybe not as riveting or solid as Catton - but deserves to be placed alongside the master historian's works as a perfect overall view of the history of the Union Army in the East.tive and index of 560 pages.

Martin didn't - or couldn't name names then.<br /><br />45 years on, the end of the Soviet bloc and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, plus the accessbility of the Intelligence archives of Britain and the United States, Martin was finally able to paint the full picture of the Mihailovich betrayal - and how the \\"End Justifies the Means\\" philosophy of the British Communist James Klugmann, an acolyte of the traitors Donald McLean and Anthony Blunt, and himself a key officer on the Balkan desk of SOE (British Intelligence) Cairo, and his sidekick, the fellow travelling Basil Davidson, alledgedly falsified reports of Chetnik resistance and sabotage operations against the Nazis and gave credit to their beloved Tito and his Partisans. One of these operations, the successful assault and destruction of the Visegrad bridge, was witnessed by British liaison officers with the Chetniks who heard on the BBC the very next day that Tito and his Partisans were responsible for that action.<br /><br />The end justified the means, as both Klugmann and Davidson wanted and worked for a Socialist (read: Communist) Yugoslavia.<br /><br />Furthermore, Klugmann and Davidson made sure that allied airdrops to the Chetniks were minimal, or of equipment that didn't work, or tropical military dress to men fighting in the bitter cold mountains of Bosnia and Montenegro. On the other hand, Klugmann and Davidson made sure that Tito got the best - including tanks and artillery pieces by the time Mihailovich got the boot by Churchill and Roosevelt in 1944.<br /><br />Even with this betrayal, Mihailovich continued to rescue American and other Allied personnel forced down in Yugoslavia - close to 1000 in total - and 500 in one operation alone, Operation Halyard. Furthermore the OSS officers and Colonel Robert McDowell who were flown into Chetnik territory witnessed how the Chetniks, abandoned by the U.S. and Britain, continued to fight the Nazis - while being stabbed in the back by Tito and his Communist-dominated Partisans. McDowell, fellow officer Gus Musulin, rescued Airman Richard Felman, and other rescued Allied personnel came home and testified on behalf of Mihailovich, but to no avail.<br /><br />In the end, the Chetniks were annihilated - those who escaped to Austria were handed back by the British to Tito to be slaughtered in the pits of Kocevje. 15,000 fortunate Chetniks were able to escape to Italy, where the British surprisingly allowed them to remain, perhaps because by then Churchill too, was having doubts, too late, about his friend Josip Broz. Mihailovich too, ended up judicially murdered by Tito in 1946.<br /><br />Martin not only updates \\"Ally Betrayed\\" in \\"Web of Disinformation\\", he is also able to point fingers at Klugmann, Davidson, and other officers both British and American who helped to engineer Tito's rise to power, like George Wucinich, an OSS officer who had fought in Spain with the Lincoln battalion, and if not a Party member, was as close to them as Davidson was - you might say they were cheating Marx of his dues.<br /><br />This is not a pretty story, and it can be said that with history's hindsight, we might have been better off with a Mihailovich-ruled Yugoslavia than the totalitarian, one-party state of Tito, that despite his aversion to his former friend Stalin, led straight to the Milosevics and the Tudjmans who brought further pain and bloodshed and massacre to a country that had had its fill - and to a Serb people that saw 2 million men, women, and children slaughtered by the Nazis and their allies, especially the Croat Ustashi, but also Bulgarians, Hungarians, and Bosnian SS led by the notorious Grand Mufti, and after all of this sacrifice to fighting Hitlerism -  ended up unhappily ruled by a Broz who chose more murder upon taking power than practicing benevolence towards his opposition. But after all, the end does justify the means...<br /><br />\\"Web of Disinformation\\" is a must read to those who wouldn't believe that Allied officers would put their Communist beliefs over the future of a people already battered and bloodied, or why Yugoslavia has turned out to be the bloody, strife-ridden, broken entity it is today.	2005-03-23

His fight, not just for freedom but to survive, and his quiet dignity impressed liberals like Jimmy Carter and conservatives like President Ronald Reagan alike. It was the latter who finally helped to secure Mr. Sharansky's freedom. From Russia Sharansky and his loving wife Avital emigrated to Israel where he became a government minister and is now Ariel Sharon's Minister of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs. <br /> <br />Even as a government minister, Sharansky still remains the voice of conscience, not only for Jews, but for the oppressed and for those who desire freedom worldwide. This book is not just an outline of his geopolitical thinking, it is a hammer straight to the nail of what is wrong in the world today, especially in the fight against terror, but more importantly what can be done RIGHT. <br /> <br />Sharansky mentions his role as a minister in the Israeli governments of Binyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, and how he urged not only his own leaders but also Bill Clinton that the only way to true peace in the Middle East was if there was true reform in the Arab world, especially in the Palestinian Authority. He compared - and compares - the rule of Arafat and other Arab leaders to those Soviet Communists who not only kept him imprisoned but also kept their hobnail boots on the peoples of Russia and Eastern Europe. Unfortunately Clinton, Albright, and Dennis Ross, in their pipe dreams did not pressure Arafat to commit to peace, and the end result is this Intifada which has claimed the lives of nearly several thousand Palestinians and nearly one thousand Israelis - a loss of life that surely could have been prevented had Clinton forced Arafat to either accept peace or be overthrown. <br /> <br />Sharansky also puts paid to those who blame Israel and by extension world Jewry for the ills of terror. His litimus test of legitimate criticism of Israel vis-a-vis the dark hatred of Jews ala Hitler is one that should not be taken lightly, especially by those like Kenny Livingstone, the Neo-Fascist \\"Lord\\" Mayor of London. <br /> <br />Sharansky's book may have already paid some dividends in the worldwide war on terrorism and also the effort to democratize the Arab world. The people of Iraq have voted with their hearts despite the fear of endless murder; the people of Lebanon are now crying for an end to Syrian and internal oppression courtesy of the thugs of Hizbullah; there are even elections on tap in Egypt, and the post-Arafat Palestinian leadership is finally coming to the conclusion that autocratic fascism and endless war will not bring about a Palestinian state, but democracy may.  <br />This call for Democracy on the Arab street is one that is loud and clear from Sharansky. <br /> <br />Indeed, President Bush has paid tribute to Sharansky and carefully listens to what the man says - he is an avid reader of this book. Rational Thought - from one of the greatest heroes of recent History.	2005-03-15

Dee Brown was NOT a Native American, but his saga of broken treaties, the massacres of Sand Creek and elsewhere, of how the Indian was mistreated, saw their buffalo slaughtered and were forced into war cannot but affect even those who cheered for the Soldiers, Cowboys, and Settlers. <br /> <br />In \\"Showdown at Little Big Horn\\" Brown took his masterful storytelling skills, plus his expertise as a Historian and whipped together a dramatic retelling of the Little Big Horn fight as seen through the eyes of many of its major participants.  <br /> <br />George Custer, Sitting Bull, and Crazy Horse are all there; as are Reno, Benteen, the hapless doomed, such as the Scout Lonesome Charley Reynolds and Newspaperman Mark Kellogg, who wasn't even supposed to cover Custer in the first place but took the place of his boss, who gave him a bloodstained belt as a talisman of good luck. The boss had been wounded in the Civil War, but the belt did not bring luck to Kellogg, who took an arrow in the back as he watched the companies of Myles Keogh and James Calhoun be annihilated by the hordes of Sioux and Cheyenne under Crazy Horse and Gall. <br /> <br />The common soldiers like bugler John Martin - Giovanni Martini, the last 7th cavalryman to see Custer and his command alive; and the braves who fought on both sides are there too. <br /> <br />Brown concludes this slim but mighty work by telling how Comanche, Captain Keogh's valiant horse, was found badly wounded on the battlefield, the only known survivor of Custer's immediate command. <br /> <br />The details of how the campaign took shape and how everything went wrong is there, with a dramatic voice created by Brown but taken from the real words of those who fought on that Greasy Grass on that summer day - June 25, 1876. <br /> <br />For those desiring a simple, yet impressive volume of the Custer fight at the Little Big Horn, writen in almost the same dramatic narrative voice style of Shaara's \\"Killer Angels\\", this is an extremely good book to begin.	2005-03-15

In fact the title of his book was borrowed from Isaac Bashevis' comment that \\"for animals, it is an eternal Treblinka\\", and Singer's own tales of his horror at the slaughter of animals and what happened to the Jews resonates throughout the book. It is not an easy read. <br /> <br />Patterson also points out something that was not known to this reviewer, that Adolf Hitler was not a total vegetarian and that stuffed squab and other game birds had been included in his dinners. <br /> <br />Patterson also cites the inspiring example of numerous Holocaust survivors and their sons and daughters who have given their own voices to the call for Animal Rights. He also warns that unless mankind stops killing animals, mankind will also be prone to murder each other. <br /> <br />Having said that, and having given the book four stars, I must also say that I am not sure if I totally agree that the Holocaust comparison should be a centerpiece of this work, and perhaps it isn't - yet that is how it initially comes across. For any kind of comparisons dilute the total horror of the Holocaust - which without discounting the sufferings and murders of Slavs and Gypsys was in history wasa singular Jewish experience.  <br /> <br />Also - being an non-vegan myself I am not totally convinced that living a total vegan lifestyle would sooth the savage beast within us. Can we treat animals better - You Bet! Can we educate those who kill deliberately or who use animals for fiendish acts, hmmmm, I'm not so sure about that. For example PETA's Ingrid Newkirk's comparison of Palestinians being treated like animals raises serious doubts about the validity of her organization, especially when the Palestinians themselves have tortured or killed donkeys and pigeons in acts of vicious animal cruelty - and have used innocent donkeys as explosive carriers to kill both animal and Israeli women and children. <br /> <br />Still Dr. Patterson has produced a remarkable book - and one worthy of being read - if only for the historical analysis and for cogent debate. <br /> <br />	2005-03-06

A graduate of West Point, he began his frontier service at the time when Custer and the 7th Cavalry were riding to their deaths at the Little Big Horn - and ended it only when denied service at the front in France in World War I. <br /> <br />In the interval period, Parker fought alongside Ranald Mackenzie in the cavalry battles with the Kickapoo, the Kiowa and Cheyenne; he saw the last Buffalo herds, went with Mackenzie to put down the Ute uprising in Colorado, and then rode south to join Crook and Miles in their campaigns against Geronimo. <br /> <br />Parker's life was a rich one - and he ended up a Major General in the Army. But it was one, if he is to be believed, of missed opportunities. For example in the campaign against Geronimo Parker writes that it was his troop that actually tracked Geronimo down - but allowed Lieutenant Gatewood the honor of cornering him and effecting his surrender. Gatewood of course received the credit, not Parker. <br /> <br />Parker's second greatest missed opportunity was in choosing not to serve in the Rough Riders due to an antipathy towards Leonard Wood, the commander of the unit. Wood actually asked Parker to help him form the regiment - and he would have been the ranking Army officer next to Wood in the regiment - or as he put it, Theodore Roosevelt never forgot a friend or someone who served alongside him in Cuba. Because of this decision Parker ended up training troops at Chickamauga camp until the Spanish-American war was over - and then briefly went to Cuba, and from there to the Philippines. <br /> <br />Indeed it is the chapters on Frontier service against the Indians and the savage fighting in the Philippines that covers most of Parker's book - along with vignettes of his personal life and those whom he served with - he is flattering towards Mackenzie and Lawton - less so towards Wood and Pershing. At the end, due to age and some unfortunate remarks about \\"chasing greasers\\" during the Villa Expedition, Parker was denied service in France when America went to war against Imperial Germany, although he briefly went over to the trenches to observe the fighting. Full of self-promotion, though honest, Parker bitterly concludes that although he was in excellent health, he was forcibly retired from the army at the beginning of 1918 after 45 years of service. <br /> <br />Despite Parker's occasional self-indulgent tone, his work is a classic tale of old army life. \\"The Old Army\\" is a worthy choice for the Custeriana buffs - even though Custer is only mentioned in passing, and for those who enjoyed works like \\"40 Miles a Day on Beans and Hay\\".	2005-03-06

Keith, or Kreichman, a \\"true believer\\" went off to Spain in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, and was killed believing he died for the freedom of the Spanish Republic and fighting Hitler. Unfortunately for Keith, it was another Fascist like Schicklgruber, the pockmarked Georgian thug named Koba aka Stalin who sent just enough arms to ensure that the Spanish Republic died a lingering death just in time for him to break bread with Herr Hitler. <br /> <br />Despite this, Radosh was weaning on the Party tenets and dogma. His music teacher at the Communist Camp he attended was none other than Pete Seeger. And Bobby Zimmerman, aka Dylan, was another pupil there - Dylan would flirt with the Left but never join the Communists. The clown below who claimed that Radosh was never in the SDS - namely B. Apetheker was too busy swallowing CP dogma courtesy of \\"her\\" daddy to realize that Radosh was just as much a major part of the Left as this pathetic so-called \\"woman\\" ever was. <br /> <br />Radosh, unlike Bettina had the courage and moral integrity to take in the truth even after it had hit him squarely in the eyes. His epiphany came long after Soviet tanks blasted away the dreams of freedom for the Hungarian people, or even after Brezhnev pissed on the \\"Prague Spring\\". It came, ironically, while Radosh was researching the lives and misdeeds of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, hoping to clear their names but discovering instead that they were indeed Soviet spies and traitors who helped give Stalin the bomb. <br /> <br />Even after exposing the lies of deceit of the Rosenbergs, Radosh still remained steadfast to his own beliefs, even denouncing the election of Ronald Reagan as President of the United States in 1980. Then he went to Nicaragua to celebrate the Sandinista revolution and came back exposing the corruption and totalitarian nature of the Sandinista regime and its thug leadership. He paints a humourous picture of the former Mrs. Mick Jagger as a pathetic bimbo, ever willing to strip off her clothes in a hurry to be the sexual playtoy of one of the worst thugs and torturers of that regime, Tomas Borge. It was in Nicaragua, amidst the freedom fighters of the Contras - that Radosh finally had the guts to acknowledge the fraud that he had supported for most of his life. <br /> <br />Ron Radosh learned a lot and is still learning. Quite unlike the \\"daughter\\" of one of Stalin's worst apologist who was also a self-loather. Irving Keith was a hero - a sadly misguided one as things turned out. The same cannot be said for H. Apetheker.	2005-01-28

Yet Joe Albright and Marcia Kunstel, his (current) wife do an admirable job in explaining why a toady, a pathetic self-righteous \\"intellectual\\" by the name of Ted Hall chose to turn over the secrets of Los Alamos and the Nagasaki A-bomb to the Soviet Union. <br /> <br />In doing so, the Albrights also uncover the story of the parallel Rosenberg spy ring, the one headed by Lincoln Brigade veteran Morris Cohen. Cohen and his wife, two of the most despicable people to ever be born in this country, chose a creed no better than Nazism to betray both their country and their people - the Jews of America, as did Hall. Cohen, who truly believed that the future of the world was better off in the hands of Stalin, went to Spain to fight Fascism but ended up becoming a Fascist himself. Wounded in action, he was co-opted to Soviet Intelligence along with several other Lincoln brigaders. The Hitler-Stalin Pact never fazed him, nor Hall, and like the Rosenbergs they didn't care about betraying the America that ensured their freedoms and those of their families. Indeed, when the Rosenbergs were arrested, Cohen and his equally obnoxious wife fled to their beloved Russia. <br /> <br />The justification? According the commentary attributed to both Hall and the late, unlamented Cohen scum, they felt that with the Soviet Union also possessing the A-Bomb it would be prevent an aggressive Capitalist America from pre-empting nuclear war on both the Soviet Union and China. Indeed, Hall, the scientist who handed over the secrets to the Cohens, was passionate in his belief that he prevented the dropping of the bomb on China in 1949. Ironically, Cohen's buddy in the Lincoln brigade, one Jack Bjoze, who is also quoted in this book, also feels the same way. Of course Mao was such a benevolent agarian reformer. <br /> <br />The book is a well-written read, but one gets sickened when confronted with the depravity and moral cowardice of a weasel like Hall and by his traitor pal Cohen who put Stalin above all including Washington, Lincoln, and everything good about America. Unlike the majority of the Lincolns who later left the Party or at least were honest and open about their Communist affiliations, Cohen comes across as a stool pigeon, a toady, and a servile lackey of Stalin. Ironically, and outrageously, the so-called Democrat Boris Yeltsin named Soviet spy Cohen, before he passed on - too late for the good of the world - a hero of Russia. So much for Yeltsin being America's friend. <br /> <br />The Albrights can also be faulted for not portraying Ted Hall and his friends as what they were - they prefer objectivity and letting history decide, in effect giving Hall a pass. In reading \\"Bombshell\\" one fervently wishes that Hall and the Cohens were dealt with American justice - at least they would have had their day in court, unlike the hapless masses in Eastern Europe during the Stalin era. <br /> <br />While there might not have been mushroom clouds over American, Soviet and Chinese cities, there were indeed the captive nations of Eastern Europe, the icy dread of the Gulag, the savage purges of Stalin, the hell on earth known as North Korea, and the repressive entity known as Castro's Cuba. Not to mention the thousands of American boys who died on the battlefields of Korea and Vietnam because our leaders were (rightly) concerned over the nuclear armed Communist nations - and still must be today. Not surprisingly both Hall and the Cohens would later express solidarity with Yasser Arafat and Palestinian terrorism. Watch your blood pressure while reading this book about some of the worst traitors in American history.	2005-01-26

It is an hand-wringing apology for Palestinian terrorism.  <br /> <br />Ben Cramer argues that Israel is losing its soul by occupying Judea-Samaria aka the West Bank. But he convienently ignores or whitewashes Arafat's decision to reject Barak's offer of a virtual Palestinian state encompassing almost all of the territories and even the unheard of offer to divide Israel's capital Jerusalem in favor of the murder, mayhem and terror that has engulfed Israel and the territories since September 2000. <br /> <br />Even now Arafat's handpicked cronies cannot summon up either the courage or the will to put down the genocidal bombers, even as Ariel Sharon is willing to use force to dismantle Jewish settlements. Cramer barely addresses this in his paean to Peace Now. <br /> <br />When nearly 90% of Palestinians still favor the eradication of Israel and its Jewish population, then books like Cramer's are useless. For the real facts and opinions, read Dershowitz's \\"A Case for Israel\\". Dershowitz, like Cramer is a Liberal, and is willing to see the Palestinian side of the coin, but unlike Cramer rightly places the blame for the end of peace on the shoulders of Arafat, Abbas, Qurei, Ashrawi and the rest of the PLO thugs. <br /> <br />Cramer may be an excellent sports writer, but he is a babe in the woods when it comes to the Israel-Arab conflict.

I have always admired the work of Max Hastings, whether it be his combat reportage from the Falkland Islands or his masterful tome on D-Day \\"Overlord\\" where he first challenged the optimism and the skill of the Allied Armies facing the Germans on the Normandy Beaches.    In \\"Armageddon\\" Hastings further challenges the myths of the superiority of the Western Allies over the Nazi armies, and whether one agrees with him or not, his findings are cause for serious thought and re-evaluation, especially in regards to the way we fight our wars today.    Some of his findings aren't new - but more novel in the way that he presented and flushed them out. For example, Hastings rips Bernard Montgomery, a fellow Brit across the coals for his twin failures to open up Antwerp Port in September 1944, and for blithely sending in three Allied Airborne divisions without adequate armor or infantry support in the ill-fated Operation Market Garden in Holland. In the first case, Montgomery chose to do a \\"Farragut at Mobile Bay\\" in reverse. Whereas the Union Admiral chose to take out the harbor forts at Mobile and neutralize the Confederate fleet before assault the city, Montgomery chose to take the city without moving on the port facilities with the utmost urgency. That cost the allies almost two months of supplies - and perhaps the drive to move into Germany in the fall of 1944. Furthermore, by destroying the 1st British Airborne Division at Arnhem, Hastings shows that even if Arnhem had been successful, Allied forces still would have lack the necessary punch to move in force across the Rhine and into the heart of Nazi Germany simply because there weren't enough supplies. Antwerp was the key to ending the war in the west, and Monty blew it badly.    But Eisenhower also deserves his fair share of criticism. Hastings points out that Patton should have been the commander of the U.S. forces in the Ruhr, and had he been in command, would havepossessed the fire, drive and imagination to move in force into the German heartland. To put in opposite Alsace-Lorraine was a waste. Furthermore, Hastings finds it unbelieveable that Ike, knowing Monty's weaknesses and his spite towards Americans, would let Montgomery take charge of the major operations designed to end the war in the fall of 1944 and fail completely!    The British soldiers were tired, their officers while courageous lacked skill and imagination. By contrast, the U.S. Army had some wonderful elite forces, i.e., the 82nd and 101st Airborne, and the 3rd and 4rd Armored Divisions to name a few, but outside of Patton and a few unorthodox officers, were either too slow or too hesitant to take the necessary initative.    By contrast Hastings gives the Wehrmacht, fighting desperately on its own soil very high marks for tenacity, and also to the Red Army for smashing through the thick German defenses from the Vistula to the Oder. He also notes that the totalitarian armies were the worst when it came to respecting human rights and lives; but better in mortal combat than the humane Allied soldiers. He also notes that Stalin had clear-cut goals whereas the sick Roosevelt vacillated to the dismay of a worn and pessimistic Churchill.    The chapter on the Soviet push into East Prussia is not for the faint of heart or to be read on a full stomach. Even those of us who cheered the destruction of the Third Reich and of the Nazi killing machine will have very little to cheer over the rapes, tortures and murders committed by the Red Army, no matter the justification, including the martyred Six Million and the countless Russians and Slavs slaughtered and starved by Hitler. In fact, much of our distrust of Russia stems from those days when the reality that Stalin was no better than Hitler finally hit home after Yalta. Hastings is not the first to chronicle the murderous rampage in Prussia, Jurgen Thorwald and James Lucas have preceded him. But he is the first to writeof this in relatively unemotional and non-partisan tones.    This is one incredible history of the final 9 months of World War II in Europe. The savagery of the battlefield, the atrocities committed by Germans and Russians, the weaknesses of the West in contrast to the bloodthirsty determination of the Soviets, and accounts by the fighting men themselves (Hastings, like Ambrose and Brokaw wanted to capture the true voices of \\"The Greatest Generation\\" before they passed on, and did so with flying colors)...it is all here in \\"Armageddon\\".     Hastings, like Jay Winik in his treatment of the last month of the Civil War in \\"April 1864\\" has captured the depth and the scope of the killing fields in Europe at the end of World War II.	2005-01-18

And thousands died, never knowing of the deals that pockmarked scum toady was making with Herr Hitler. <br /> <br />Radosh also presents the documents of those International Brigade men who went to Spain fighting for Democracy and Revolution, and when they found out that the revolution and fight against Fascism had been betrayed, they themselves were arrested and many shot. Close to a dozen Americans were shot by the GPU, some on charges of desertion, others like Albert Wallach, Vernon Selby, Marvin Stern and Harry Perchik on political grounds. Even non-Communist Lincoln Brigaders like one-time commander Philip Detro, a self-described Roosevelt Democrat, may have been terminated by a Party that was little tolerant of dissent. <br /> <br />One of the foremost documents Radosh features is one written by \\"M. Fred\\" M. Fred was Manfred Stern or Emil Kleber the vaunted General Emilio Kleber who saved Madrid during the November 1936 siege. Kleber writes a critical document, encompassing almost 75 pages, justifying his role in the International Brigades and acknowledging mistakes. What Kleber was really writing here was a plea for his life, because Stalin had already begun the purges of International Brigade commanders (1938) when this document was written. <br /> <br />And little did Kleber know - he was to perish shortly after returning to Moscow - that Stalin had already made up his mind that no matter how many victories the International Brigades would win, the Republic was doomed and just a pawn, a toy to be played with Herr Hitler. <br /> <br />Many, like Bill Herrick in his excellent \\"Jumping the Line\\" would learn the bitter truth early on. Others, like Harry Fisher, would parrot the Party Line till the day he died protesting the just war against the Stalin of the Middle East, Saddam Hussein. <br /> <br />This is a five star book that only received four stars because I wish that Radosh would write more of the Lincolns and his uncle. Their idealism, and in many cases a sincere fight against Hitlerism and to support the democratic republic of Spain - instead of the cynical betrayal of it by Joe Stalin.	2005-01-14

For Americans and even Canadians who are unfamiliar with the Riel Rebellion of 1884-1885, think Sitting Bull meets Chief Joseph. Big Bear was more a medicine man than a fighting chief, and like the Nez Perce Chief Joseph, preferred co-existence with the Whites. But events, including the chaotic aftermath of the Little Big Horn, the expansion of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, the arrival in Canada of American whiskey traders - and finally the savage decimation of Canada's Buffalo herds by the beginning of the 1880s pushed Big Bear over the edge.  <br /> <br />Urging co-existence and compromise, only to see his efforts largely ignored by the national government in Ottawa, and watching his people slowly starve to death when the Canadian promise of food never materialized, Big Bear, against his better judgment, rallied his people to the side of the equally persecuted Metis, the half-French, half-Indian people led by the fiery Louis Riel. When Riel promised the Indians that they would have a sovereign entity if the rebellion succeeded, Big Bear joined Riel in his desperate rebellion against the Canadian authorities. Despite some initial victories, the rebellion was quickly crushed by the superior firepower of the RCMP and the (British) Canadian militia. <br /> <br />Whereas Big Bear sought only peace and reconciliation, the victorious Canadians, fearing that a successful rebellion would have seen a Metis state in alliance with the United States, as well as a sovereign Cree-Blackfoot entity as promised by Riel, sought only vengeful and reprisal. Riel was hanged, in a trial that borderlined on judicial murder. Big Bear and his fellow chief Poundmaker were sentenced to death, but their sentences were commuted to long prison terms. Although the sentences were later reduced, and Big Bear released after only a couple of years in a Canadian prison, he soon sickened and died, about a year after his release. Many say, as in the case of Chief Joseph, that Big Bear did of a broken heart. <br /> <br />If Big Bear was the kind of warrior chief that Crazy Horse was, and had Riel's rebellion took place right after Custer's Last Stand, when the Metis-Cree-Blackfoot alliance might have even linked up with the Sioux (the Sioux and the Blackfoot were enemies, but they might have considered an alliance of convienence in a war against the hated Whites), history would have been changed - with Canada's western provinces quite possible included into the United States with the possible allowance of a sovereign Indian nation in the Northwest. \\"The End of Freedom\\" was truly an end of freedom - in more ways than one - for Big Bear and for his people. <br /> <br />I read this book many years ago and would love to get a personal copy. I also recommend the out-of-print \\"Strange Empire\\" by Howard.	2005-01-09

Grant: The Unlikely Hero (Eminent Lives)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	A Nice Simple Account of the Life of U.S. Grant	At first glance, Michael Korda (\\"Queenie\\", \\"Horse People\\", \\"Man to Man\\") seems to be a very unlikely writer to tackle the life of U.S. Grant. But he does so, and quite admirably. <br /> <br />No, this isn't a full biography ala McFeely, or Geoff Perrett, or Jean Edward Smith. But for the Civil War novice, or someone interested in a small yet mighty biography of the Union General and U.S. President, Korda's book is chock full of facts, vignettes, and being the writer that he is, depicting a life full of character, action and pathos. Yet also a simple, honest life of a great American. <br /> <br />The other reviewers have pretty much captured the essence of what Korda has written - a biography that showed Grant to be the great military hero he was -  even greater than his adversary, Robert E. Lee. But also a capable and decent President despite the scandals that plagued his administration and the ultimate failure of Reconstruction. <br /> <br />The only reason that I didn't give it a fifth star is due to the brevity of the volume, plus the fact that Korda really doesn't cover any ground already covered by aforementioned writers. But for what he does in his re-telling of Grant's story, he captures the imagination and the interest of the reader. And isn't that what counts???	2004-12-26
US	52532871	RKGMO2A0UVM4K	0807118095	103303292	From Shiloh to San Juan: The Life of "Fightin' Joe" Wheeler (Southern Biography)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	The Fighting Gamecock	\\"God I'd hate to see the look on Old Stonewall's face when he sees Joe arriving at Heaven's gate in that Blue Uniform\\" - one Confederate veteran alledgedly told another, or words to that effect when General Wheeler passed on.    By that time this Fighting Gamecock of the Confederacy had proudly worn once again the Blue of the United States Army, leading Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders through a number of vicious, swirling fire-fights right up to that grand assault on San Juan Hill.    This was something that came natural to Joseph Wheeler. Georgia-born, Ct. raised, and finally a son of Alabama. A West Pointer, several years ahead of George Custer (they knew each other)Wheeler, despite ties to the North, chose to resign his commission and go south at the outbreak of the Civil War.  While he might not have been a brilliant Cavalry Commander, and he did have his run-ins with Nathan Bedford Forrest, who after one operation that failed (against Fort Donelson) vowed never to serve under Wheeler again, he was still outstanding at best, extremely competent at least - and bedevilled Sherman and the hapless fool and suspected coward who commanded the Union cavalry facing him in the Georgia campaign, H. Judson Kilpatrick (his West Point classmate).    Despite a rough time imprisoned after Appomattox, Wheeler turned the other check, and became a U.S. Senator who openly urged reconciliation between North and South. He could be faulted for prejudices towards Blacks, he was a product of the times and considerably less prejudiced than the bigots of his time like fellow Alabama Senator George Tyler Morgan, Pitchfork Ben Tillman, and Tom Watson - and Wheeler did respect, if not like, the \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" who fought alongside him in the 9th and 10th Cavalry in Cuba.    When William McKinley, himself a Union vet who served at Antietam and in Sheridan's Shenandoah campaigns urged Wheeler to once again serve his country in the Spanish-American War, he hesitated only briefly, then went on to don the Union Blue and lead the Cavalry forces to glory in Cuba - marred only slightly by his own rashness at Las Guisamas. Even then Wheeler, momentarily forgetting that he was in Cuba, not at Chickamauga, uttered one of that war's most memorable lines - \\"We've got the damn Yankees on the run!\\"     Wheeler, old and grey bearded, was still full of vigor and served America one more time in the Philippines before retiring and finally dying in that well-known Southern town called New York City. He was finally laid to rest in his U.S. Army uniform at Arlington cemetery.    Dyer gave us the only solid biography of this American hero. I only wish he had provided the reader with more illustrations than just the couple showing Wheeler as a West Pointer, A Confederate General, a U.S. Senator, and finally a Major General of Volunteers in the Spanish-American War.	2004-12-25

When Bill Clinton chose to make those pin-prick cruise missile strikes on empty terror camps in Afghanistan and on an alledged pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan. And where was Mr. Clarke when Bill Clinton chose to send in B-52s to incinerate 2000 non-terrorist pro-American Serbs instead of sending them (or special forces) off to the mountains of Afghanistan?  <br /> <br />Clinton, preoccupied with saving his a** after the impeachment hearings chose to make an Impeachment war over Kosovo, but Richard Clarke (and I don't question his patriotism, or what he did try to do - only where his fingerpointing should have been made) fell into lockstep with Clinton, Madeleine Albright, Sandy Berger, and the rest who are much more responsible for ignoring the threat of Al Qaeda than the Bush Administration (remember, Clinton had 8 years to deal with Osama - and Richard Clarke, if anyone should know that well) <br /> <br />Richard Clarke occupied the same Oval Office that Oliver North once worked out of. There the similarity ends. Yes, President Reagan, God Bless Him, should be rightly blamed for not dealing with terrorists after the bombing of the Marine barracks. But he does deserve credit, as does Colonel North, for the bombing of Libya, and the swift retaliation on the hijackers of the \\"Achille Lauro\\". North was the architect of the latter action, and what did Richard Clarke do that was comparable. <br /> <br />Mr. Clarke did try time and time again to alert Clinton about Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But Billy was too busy with the bims. He wouldn't even meet with James Woolsey, his CIA director (see Gerald Posner's book), something Mr. Clarke doesn't mention here. <br />yes, President Bush can be faulted, but he had only eight months to deal with Al Qaeda and was in the process of cobbling together a plan despite the incompetency of the FBI and of Mr. Tenet, the holdover at CIA whom he should have jettisoned right away. Bill Clinton gave us that FBI, Mr. Tenet, and an emasculated Intelligence. <br /> <br />Furthermore, Mr. Clarke can also be faulted for being cocksure of himself. Tommy Franks points that out in his book, and Clarke did some unfortunate self-promotion on 60 Minutes a good two years before 9/11 about how we were unprepared but hey he was doing a wonderful job. I do believe Mr. Clarke meant well, and maybe working with a Colonel North (whom Clarke's friends in the Kerry camp despised) they would have been a team that Osama would have been reckoned with. It was his misfortune to serve the Carterites and Slick. <br /> <br />And he was NO Ollie North who did get things done. If North was still running that office instead of Clarke, we would have been BOMBING TERRORISTS in Afghanistan, not innocent civilians in Belgrade.	2004-12-25

If one already has Rod Gragg's poignant collection of Civil War letters, \\"From Fields of Fire and Glory\\", or the Civil War in a box collection that was a bestseller some years back, then this book is a must for your collection.  <br /> <br />Mr. Miller has chosen some 32 wonderful and even some little-known maps, including the \\"Cram map\\" that was ill-used by McClellan in the Peninsula Campaign, the bloodstained map that Union General James McPherson was using when he was killed in action during the Atlanta campaign (one can clearly see the blood stains on this removeable map - starkly bringing the reality of the Civil War home). There is even a unique map illustrating the proposed Confederate defenses of Danville, Viriginia, the town that Jefferson Davis and the Confederate cabinet fled to on the eve of Appomattox. The plan to defend Danville as if it were the new Confederate capital came to an abrupt end as Lee met Grant at the McLean home. <br /> <br />This is as close as one can get to holding history in his or her hand without possessing the actual document or map. My only qualm is the $35 price - amazon offers it pretty reasonably - and the knowledge that many books like this one do end up on bargain tables in about a year at a 1/4 of the price. Having said that, though, this is probably the best new Civil War gift book one would be most happy to receive this holiday season.	2004-12-23

Thrice wounded, and saved by a grizzled old veteran, Sergeant Ross, Kern talks about an old Buddhist monk whom he believes is the reason why he is still alive. He recuperates, and then deserts his unit, only to be recuperated by U.S. MP's. Kern is court martialled, but Sgt. Ross, over the skepticism of a fresh Lieutenant named Gallo, claims that Kern was only trying to rejoin his unit when he disappeared, and Kern is let go. <br /> <br />And after only a couple of weeks disappears again. <br /> <br />For three decades the case of Corporal Kern, and whether he is dead, or somehow might still be alive in the mountains of Vietnam, and whether he has become a Doa-Nai, a \\"wandering monk\\" possessed with special but also forbidden powers. Gallo keeps in touch with Ross, badgering him about Kern, sometimes angering and sometimes amusing him, but eventually they do decide to return to Vietnam. Here they find that life and death may have made a certain kind of sense to the boy from Kentucky. <br /> <br />In his dedication, the author cites Lewis Puller, the war-disabled son of the legendary Marine Chesty Puller, who after years of battling his own scars and his own demons, sadly took his life. <br /> <br />I want to thank Larry McAuliffe for turning me on to this gripping and yes, spiritual story, and an aspect of the Vietnam War. It reads like a true story, but it is solid good historical fiction.	2004-12-23

The chapter on the woeful experience of James Woolsey, one of the finest men to serve our country through four administrations (not a Richard Clarke) is worth the purchase of the book alone. Clinton, desperately seeking a Conservative voice on his Carterite National Security team, chose Woolsey to head the CIA, barely knowing the man, and then ignored him. Gathering intelligence on the increasing threat of Al Qaeda, Woolsey time and time and time again urgently sought one-on-one meetings with Clinton, only to be rebuffed. In one astonishing conversation, Woolsey asked his National Security counterparts if they had access to the President - and even liberals like Tony Lake and Warren Christopher responded that they had not. Woolsey, in disgust, resigned. As did a Les Aspin, scapegoated for Clinton's failures to deal with Al Qaeda terrorism in Somalia.    This was Bill Clinton - a guy who was supposed to be on the ball and secure our people. And Liberals still talk about President Reagan nodding off.     What is even more remarkable about this fully detailed, factual account of how the ball was dropped is that the Posners were liberals too. Gerald Posner was best known for writing critical accounts of the Kennedy Assasination and of the Warren Commission. Here he points out how our combined National Security agencies could have brought the war home to Al Qaeda after the first World Trade Center bombing before they could strike us again, and instead how the Clinton team chose to pinprick empty camps and pharamecutical factories.    Perhaps the best of the finger pointing books published since 9/11, and certainly one of the most-researched.    (...)	2004-12-23

Lee never had the chance to pen his own autobiography as U.S. Grant did. He meant to, but kept holding it off until heart disease claimed his life five years after the surrender of Appomattox.<br /><br />Many of those who served under him during the Civil War wrote biographies of the great Confederate General, claiming to know how he felt, and what he thought. But only two of them really came close. The ponderous but solidly written \\"Memoirs of Robert E. Lee\\" by his Aide, Colonel Long, and this volume, comprised of letters actually written by Lee, and the remembrances of those who knew him well, and none more so than the author of the book, his own son, Captain Robert E.Lee, Jr.<br /><br />Captain Lee describes his childhood in the Lee household, of General Lee's love of animals, especially horses. He describes a man who smiled, was warm, as compared to the austere, solemn descriptions and illustrations of him once the Civil War commenced. He writes how Lee agonized within his own family of the decision to leave the U.S. Army, and then join the Confederacy, even though wishing for a quiet, neutral life, and of Lee's personal losses during the war - a daughter who passed on, a son wounded and captured, the son's frail wife also passing on, and the known loss of their dearly beloved home in Arlington, which was turned into the national cemetery of the same name.<br /><br />Captain Lee studiously avoids the controversial sides of Lee, his stand on slavery or the rights of the South, concentrating mainly on the personality of man and how he dealt with others.<br /><br />This is a volume that belongs on the shelf of any Civil War buff, especially those interested in the life of Robert E.

And why should they? The current French leadership, from Chirac on down, and even the so-called \\"Socialist\\" opposition have all benefited with their \\"blood\\" (of American Soldiers and Israeli and Iraqui civilians) for oil arrangements with Saddam. It is all coming out in the wash how Chirac, former French Foreign and Defense Ministers, Businessmen and Financiers have made billions - while Saddam used the monies collected to kill his own people, to seek out WMDs, and to pay Hamas.    As this book (and others) have pointed out, Chirac himself is notorious in this regard. Back in 1974, as the then Prime Minister under the Giscard D'Estaing government, Chirac negotiated with Saddam for the purchase of the Osirak Nuclear Reactor - the same one destroyed by the Israeli Air Force in 1981 . Chirac has never cared what Saddam did to his people, all he cares about is the Franc - and in grovelling to the Arab world at the expense of his own country and the West. In doing so, Chirac \\"sticks\\" it to Israel, (he has always been a supporter of Yasser Arafat) and to America, which in the past was content to take his insults until this current President Bush came along, and until we endured 9/11.    Even then, and even now, Chirac prefers Islamic terrorism to his erstwhile allies in the U.S. and Britain. French weapons, as well as the old Soviet ones, dominated the arsenals of Saddam's Iraq, and are still being used today to kill American GI's. French business contracts were most favored by the Baathist regime. The influx of Arab immigrants into France, even those with the most extreme views of Sharia and Fatwa, was greeting with approval and enthusiasm by Chirac and his cronies - even after French citizens were themselves being raped and killed by the more extreme of the newcomers.    But after all, Chirac is onlycarrying on the tradition of those who instigated the Dreyfus Case, of Petain, Laval, Vichy, De Gaulle, Giscard, Mitterrand - and sacre bleu! - himself. Or why France is no longer any great shakes in the world.    All this and more, the contracts, the deals, the \\"stabbing America\\" in the back is carefully documented by Timmerman. And this isn't anything new - French animus towards America goes back to DeGaulle, even after scores of American boys died on the roads to Paris so that the French could get to the city first, Giscard, Chirac, even Mitterrand and others are part and parcel of this anti-Americanism even after we saved their country in two wars.    Timmerman's book, full of accounts of deceit, of arms sales while civilians starved or were killed by terrorists, of how the Franc was more important than the blood of Americans, is a must read if we are ever to have a cohesive, firm policy with a country that whether we like it or not has chosen to be our adversary, instead of our ally. Regime Change? Yes, in France.	2004-10-08

The first phase of my childhood interest in things Civil War had ended, and it was not until another five or so years later when it was rekindled again, as it has been to this day. <br /> <br />\\"It's fiction\\", and your reviewer was not into fiction, even historical fiction. Still, as he perused the pages of this novel, the familiar characters - Lee, Longstreet, Winfield Scott Hancock, and newer Union and Confederate heroes - John Buford, Lewis Armistead, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain leaped off the pages as if this book was true history. Which in a sense, it is. <br /> <br />What also struck me was the poignancy as expressed in those first chapters when Buford confronted his mortality (he died of disease only six months after Gettysburg), or even more so when Shaara wrote of how the grizzled Confederate General Lewis Armistead looked across the lines at Cemetery Ridge towards where his pre-war friend, Union General Winfield Scott Hancock was waiting, and recalled their final meeting together, right after the war began, at Hancock's home in Los Angeles. Armistead was going South at the side of Albert Sidney Johnston, the Confederate General killed at Shiloh; Hancock would be going North. <br />With tears in his eyes Armistead had vowed that he should be struck dead if he lifted his hand towards his friend Hancock, a preminition that would soon, sadly, come to pass. <br /> <br />Many years later, having purchased the trade paperback edition of the book, and more appreciative of it, I recommended it highly as a piece of American Historical Literature to Junior and High School Students. It is gripping, poignant, full of character, and the events and swirling battle scenes written a way that is accessible to readers young and old. <br /> <br />No, it is not an account of the battle of Gettysburg, nor is iteven a fictional account of the entire drama of Gettysburg. Strong historical fiction, strong human interest story, and gripping vignettes of the major scenes of Gettysburg - it is all there. This is a classic of the Civil War, which is also a classic of American Literature.	2004-10-07

Hmmm. That's interesting. For if the United States did 60 years ago what Soros and so many of the uninformed posters here want us to do now,get out of Iraq, get out of Afghanistan, support the P.L.O., Mr. Soros might be a lampshade hanging in some victorious Nazi's bedroom.    Or to take this analogy one step further. The United States was attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941 - NOT Nazi Germany. President Roosevelt correctly linked Imperial Japan to Fascist Germany and declared war on both. What Soros, and others here advocate would have left Roosevelt only (possibly) responding to Japan, not Hitler.    President Bush is regarded by Soros as being arrogant. Fine. President Bush knew that Saddam had gassed or slaughtered thousands of his own people. He knew Saddam desired to rebuild his nuclear and biological weapons programs. He knew that Saddam had paid $25,000 to the families of the Hamas Genocidal Bombers who deliberately targeted Jewish civilians in Israel.    Get that, George Soros? Jewish civilians. Like a terrified family hiding out with forged papers in the middle of a Budapest full of the SS and homegrown killers of the Arrow Cross. Of course, Mr. Soros is also a cheerleader for the PLO.    President Bush, like President Roosevelt over 60 years ago chose to wage a preventive war for the security of all Americans. Maybe Saddam wasn't a threat - maybe he was. But was Serb Kosovo a threat to the National Security of the United States? No, but Bill Clinton bombed civilians just the same. And nary a word from the Soros, Michael Moore, Kerry kool-aid drinking club.    Mr. Soros has done some wonderful things. I don't doubt that. He has rebuilt the libraries in Bosnia that were deliberately destroyed by Bosnian Serbs (and by the way, yes, that was an intervention that was morally correct - Kosovo, on the other hand, was not - and even worse, Clinton could have sent those B-52s to Afghanistan to terminate Bin Laden before 3000 Americans died).    If anyone in this world has NO right to criticize \\"American Supremacy\\" it would be a guy who hid out on the \\"Gentile\\" side of Budapest while his co-religionists were being slaughtered. And I will repeat this. If Roosevelt behaved in precisely the way the Soros-moveon.org crowd wanted President Bush to behave, Mr. Soros would not be a breathing moneyed Capitalist espousing Socialist views - he would not be with us, period. As it was, we didn't do enough to save the Jews of Europe, but given Mr. Soros' world mindset, he wouldn't have wanted us to save them, him or anyone else for that matter.    Oh yeah, he wants the U.N. to be our moral compass. The same UN that failed miserably in Rwanda, the Sudan, Cambodia, and is supportive of Hamas.	2004-10-07

Ever hear of the \\"Baltic Sky\\"? Probably not, as the mainstream press won't report this, and neither will Richard Clarke. But the \\"Baltic Sky\\" was part of a 15-ship floating bomb factory. It was heading for Greece, and if it had blown, the results would have been worse than Hiroshima. American intelligence and other sources, alerted the Greek Navy, so they were able to stop the vessel before it docked at Athens.    In fact, this Al Qaeda fleet has been effectively decommissioned.    Are we safe? Of course not. Should we be complacent. No, and Miniter tells you why. He points out what really happened in Spain - failures in security, a government that did not tell the populace the truth, and just plain appeasement. He points out that what happened in Spain could take place here, and why it hasn't happened isn't due to Al Qaeda not trying.    Miniter also warns us about Iran - an Iran that wants very much to be a nuclear power, an Iran that not only is a terrorist state, but also an Iran that supports groups like Al Qaeda. Miniter implies that Osama could very well be in Iran - an assertion that is backed by Iranian defectors. If that is truly the case, and President Bush will need to act, he might not be able to do so, thanks to those who have questioned why he went into Iraq (which by the way, Miniter points out the ties Osama and Al Qaeda had with the Saddam regime).    Because some of the information that Miniter reports has not yet been substantiated, this reviewer gives the book 4 stars. But even if most of it is true, and Miniter has been right on regarding the destruction of the Al Qaeda leadership and terror cells, this is a book our policymakers, our people, and even those who subscribe to the Kerry-Moore-Richard Clarke worldview had better read.	2004-10-07

Like U.S. Grant, a man whom Ambrose had written much of and clearly respected, Ambrose faced death not just with courage - but fighting to the end as he wrote this historical love song to America. <br /> <br />In \\"To America\\", Ambrose writes movingly about himself, his family, why he chose to be a Historian,the great American Historians who were his mentors - Hesseltine and T. Harry Williams, how his M.A. thesis - the published biography of the Civil War General Henry Halleck prompted Dwight Eisenhower to call upon Ambrose to edit his papers. Ambrose also writes how he never wanted to write about Richard Nixon, but having done so, found himself respecting, if not liking that complex former President. <br /> <br />In \\"To America\\" Ambrose writes about our major events in a narrative that reads as if he were talking to the American people in their living rooms. He writes how: <br /> <br />- U.S. Grant meant to enforce Reconstruction and preserve the rights of Black Americans, but was unable to do so because the weary North no longer had the desire nor the will to confront a bitter South over Reconstruction policies 10 years after Appomattox. <br /> <br />- That there was no deliberate policy by the U.S. Government to wipe out the Indian tribes; but that a combination of factors, disease, inter-tribal conflict, even buffalo killing by Native Americans, as well as White lies, Manifest Destiny, and the Plains Wars marked the demise of the Indian grip on the territories of the West. <br /> <br />- He writes how he originally felt revulsion over the Atom Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, until he discovered how fully prepared Japan was to commit collective hari-kari over an American invasion of the home islands.He cites how one American officer, future NATO commander Andrew Goodpaster, in projecting American casualties, figured that 800,000 Americans would either be killed or wounded in an assault on Japan, and that Truman's decision to drop the bombs was not only a just one - but a necessary one that saved the lives of both Americans and Japanese. <br /> <br />- He writes of how he was educated to dislike Theodore Roosevelt as a blowhard and braggart - and then grew to admire him for both his domestic and foreign policies. <br /> <br />- And how he met and wrote about those \\"Bands of Brothers\\", whether they be the men from U.S. 101st Airborne who fought from the Normandy Drop Zones to Hitler's \\"Eagles Nest\\", Major John Howard, of the British 6th Airborne who secured \\"Pegasus Bridge\\" and of the German Panzer General Von Luck, who opposed Howard and the Red Berets at Pegasus Bridge yet became a firm friend of that gallant man of the Airborne after the war. <br /> <br />- He writes of how he grew to dislike and vocally oppose our Vietnam involvement yet how he also fully respected the American soldiers, sailors, and airmen who fought there. <br /> <br />Ambrose also wrote of how America, after 9/11 still remained the last best hope of mankind, and how this nation is a force for good, not evil. He wrote all this in a slim, readable volume that should be passed on from generation to generation. For it was not just Stephen Ambrose's lasting legacy - but a lasting legacy from a beloved historian to all Americans. <br /> <br />At 6.99 this book deserves an honored place in the libraries of all thoughtful Americans.	2004-10-07

Ross headed a team of \\"Jewish\\"-Americans (i.e., Ross, Aaron Miller, Richard Haass, Dan Kurtzer) who felt that pressuring Israel to make dangerous concessions, and appeasing Arab terrorists like Yasser Arafat and brutal dictators like Hafez Assad would bring peace to the Middle East.  <br /> <br />In shaping Israel in their myopic, \\"peace now\\" warped state of minds, Ross and company only made things worse for both the United States and Israel, and encouraged, if not deliberately, the scores of genocidal bombings and violations of the Oslo Accords by the Palestinians. <br /> <br />If not directly involved, as both Kurtzer and Miller were, in drafting James Baker's notorious \\"Greater Israel\\" speech at the beginning of the George H.W. Bush Presidency, Ross aided and abetted that \\"stick it to Israel\\" mind-set that was so prevalent in the Bush I White House, and so thankfully gone from W.'s  <br />Ross, always uncomfortable with Republicans, gleefully accepted Clinton's request to stay on in the State Department and saw his career rise under Warren Christopher and Madeleine Albright, both of whom shared Jim Baker's moddycuddlying of Arab dictatorships, Palestinian extremists, and an animus towards Israel. <br /> <br />While he might not have been as blatant as Bill Clinton, Albright, and James Carville were in the undermining of the Netanyahu government, Ross and his new sidekick Marty Indyk certainly were not unhappy to see Netanyahu replaced by the pliant ehud barak. After all, that kind of moderation would help Arafat - whom, even after he had started to violate the Oslo Accords, was still considered to be a man of \\"peace\\" - a statesman. <br /> <br />The blinkers finally came off Dennis Ross' naive eyes when Arafat, angrily rejecting a Camp David peace plan largely drafted by Dennis and giving the Palestinians 97% of the West Bank (Judea-Samaria) and half of Jerusalem, walked away and resorted to murder and mayhem. Dennis Ross finally had the intellectual courage to blast Yasser Arafat and cite him as the main reason why \\"peace at any price\\" failed. It was only 10 years too late. Thankfully Dennis Ross chose not to stay with W.'s incoming administration - and thankfully that had no great desire retaining him. <br /> <br />Why two stars instead of one? Simply because Ross' book should be read for his retelling of historical events and how he conducted, or misconducted U.S. Policy; even if the book itself is a ponderous read. The reader though, would be urged to also read Yossef Bodansky's brilliant and insightful \\"The High Cost of Peace\\" to show how the appeasing Arafat-pressuring Israel policies of BushI-Baker-Clinton-Albright and Dennis Ross ultimately failed, and also harmed the national security interests of the United States.	2004-10-06

For the KKK or the Nazi Party - substitute the \\"Freedom Party\\".    For the Third Reich, substitute the bitter Confederate South and its ancillary allies.    In his latest post Civil War \\"what if\\" saga of a divided America, Turtledove, using familiar characters from his past works (Carsten, Abner Dowling, Featherstone and others), imagines a Fascist South launching the kind of blitzkrieg war Hitler inflicted on Russia. In fact, he even uses the actual date when the Panzers rolled into the then Soviet Union, June 22, 1941, as the date Featherstone launches his surprise attack on the United States.    America is taken by surprise. Philadelphia is bombed in an air assault reminiscent of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. The Southern Panzers have the drop on the U.S. Army and quickly drive through Kentucky to the Great Lakes, dividing the country. The Socialist leadership of President Al Smith, whose policies of appeasement encouraged Featherstone's aggression, nevertheless is able to prevent the Southern forces from moving into the major cities on the East Coast, and U.S. Air and Naval forces immediately bring the war back to the South. Yet the United States is on the ropes.    More disturbing than the initial U.S. defeats are the stories coming out of the Deep South, where the ruthless Featherstone, having killed off his opposition, has appointed a \\"First World War\\" crony, a hard drinking redneck by the name of Jefferson Pinkney to oversee his concentration camp program. Blacks are rounded up, ostensibly to work at these camps, and are taken out to the swamps and killed by Featherstone's equivalent of the S.S.     A few Blacks, including Louis Armstrong manage to escape to the north, where their horrific reports are dismissed by a Northern society that despite the Southern excesses and atrocities are still deeply divided on the issue of Race. And even as the United States gets a grip and its armedforces prepare to respond to the Southern aggression, the Holocaust of Black America intensifies.    It could have happened here. For Featherstone, one can easily substitute Tom Watson (not the golfer), John Rankin, Theodore Bilbo, Robert Byrd, Fritz Hollings, David Duke.    For a weak, U.S. President Al Smith, Henry Wallace, Jimmy Carter and George McGovern easily come to mind...and yes, Dennis Kucinich, Howie Dean and even the current Democratic nominee for President.    Will the Fascist, Racist South prevail - while this book doesn't have the same battlefield intensity as previous Turtledove works  had, he does leave the reader with that queasy, hanging in the air feeling.	2004-10-06

It is the summer of 1863. Lee, using Longstreet's plan to move in against the unprotected right flank of the Union line along the Round Tops, scores a decisive breakthrough at Gettysburg, and the Union Army is routed, its leaders dead, wounded or captured, save for the lecherous Dan Sickles. Lee is poised to march on Washington, and only the remnants of the Army of the Potomac, and troops brought up from the South, including the famed Massachusetts 54th (Black) regiment, are between him and the capital. Acting rashly, Lee chooses to assault ala Pickett the Union fortifications outside of Washington, and is repulsed, with scores of dead and dying Confederates draped across the Union trenches amidst scenes of unbelieveable horror - a cannonball rips a Confederate drummer boy apart in one grisly scene.    Lee turns instead to consolidating his hold on the north, sending Stuart back into Pennsylvania while he himself marches on Baltimore. The operation is successful, Baltimore falls. But then there is a new cloud on the horizon. For President Lincoln urgently calls upon U.S. Grant, recently victorious at Vicksburg, to take command of the Union forces facing Lee, and Lee discovers how formidable Grant is.    Without divulging the rest of the story, let's just say that there are plenty of cliffhangers and plenty of intrigue - including Judah Benjamin's urging Lee to emancipate the Slaves and recruit them into the Confederate Army. Dan Sickles once again proves to be a bumbler. And Grant - he does what Lee really didn't expect him to do.    About the only drawback or criticism I'd make of this book is that George Stoneman remains the commander of the Army of the Potomac's Cavalry, and defeats and kills Wade Hampton in a cavalry battle in Pennsylvania. George Stoneman was a best an average cavalry leader, at worst a bumbler whose Richmond Raid in 1863 did absolutely nothing to impair Lee at a time cavalry was needed at Chancellorsville, and whose 1864 raid to liberate the prisoners at Andersonville and to destroy the railroads leading into Atlanta was a terrible fiasco - with Stoneman himself taken prisoner. Replace him with Al Pleasonton or Sheridan in the next volume, or even bring up a guy by the name of George Custer, but please let's dispense with Stoneman. And to defeat Wade Hampton, one of the very best Southern cavaliers??? Wow! That is stretching it a bit far.    Even if one disagrees with Speaker Gingrich's politics (this reviewer thought he was an outstanding Speaker of the House, thank you), the man knows his Civil War History, and boy, can he write it. \\"Gettysburg\\" might have been a bit predictible in its alt-History outcome, but certainly not \\"Grant Comes East\\". If you are a Civil War and Alt-History enthusiast, you're in for a very big and very pleasant surprise!	2004-10-03

Bob Dylan's \\"Autobiography\\", or the choice passages released thus far are a revelation. Instead of this mumbling, off-the-wall, even angry young man, Robert Zimmerman Dylan comes across as a guy you'd definitely want to have a beer with, or swap stories, or even discuss world events with. <br /> <br />Bob, despite the initial Left-wing background, the bohemian stuff and all, just longed for a picket fenced home, roses in the garden, a wife and kids, or, in short, to be like most Americans were in the 1960s and early 1970s. But fame and notoriety had its black side, as everybody hounded the poor man. <br />Up in relatively remote Woodstock, Mr. Dylan was hounded by the Rock music paparazzi; he was hounded by the fans, he was hounded by the tourists even as he was trying to both recover from that motorcycle accident and enjoy his children. What Dylan experienced there was really \\"Rainy Day Woman\\" - everybody must get stoned - or stone poor Bob! <br /> <br />If one also expected Bob to just \\"hang\\" with the rest of the folkies and the rockers, Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, the Beatles and the Byrds, who took his acoustic-based songs, electrified them and made them something very special, well, you'd be in for a surprise. Bob also liked Hollywood folks and if wasn't pressed by the public was (and probably is) a great neighbor. <br /> <br />Bob Dylan isn't thought much as an innovator - more as a brilliant composer and thinker - but remember when he strapped on that electric guitar alongside The Band at Newport and revolutionized Folk Music. The purists threw the brickbats, but Folk music was never the same again - it was for better, not worse. <br /> <br />The stories about all of those great songs - \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" and the rest - maybe Mr. Dylan will cover them in this fascinating chronicle; maybe he won't. But his life experience, as surprising as it now seems, is something this reviewer is looking forward to read more of.	2004-10-02

Zell Miller, however chose country and national security above party, and the nation should be most grateful to him.     In \\"National Party No More\\" Miller points out his own background, in the mountains of Georgia, his service as a Marine, and his consecutive elections to public office, becoming Governor of Georgia and finally a United States Senator.    He writes of how both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton campaigned from the \\"right\\", i.e., as Conservative Democrats with strong defense and fiscal policies, then immediately reverted into McGovernite anti-defense, tax-and-spend Liberals upon becoming President. He writes why he cannot support candidates from a party that doesn't take the war on terrorism seriously enough, or candidates who have voted time and time again to emasculate our defenses, our intelligence capabilities. The finger is pointed - not just at Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter but at John Kerry and Tom Daschle.     The tone of this book is not anger - but regret of a party that has lost touch with most Americans, and Love of the United States of America.    Miller writes of how he killed rattlesnakes at his remote home for survival; and how that is analogous to this war on terrorism and the battle in Iraq.  He writes of his core values - country above party - security over friends who would deny us a strong military - and he writes why he fully supports President Bush.    Jimmy Carter can't understand this - but Jimmy Carter couldn't understand why supporting a Shah or Somoza was much more important than allowing the Ayatollah and Sandinista killers to take power. And he still doesn't get it.     Zell Miller does get it. And for those who criticize this man, remember he didn't run for the Presidency even though he was more than eminently capable - and much more so than the current Democratic candidate - to do so. Semper Fi, Senator Miller.    P.S. For the ranters who accuse Zell Miller of everything up to being the devil incarnate, and of being a segregationist, shame on you. Senator Miller sincerely renounced and regretted his prior views years ago - and says so, which is something I have yet to hear from Robert KKK Byrd.	2004-10-02

Lindbergh doesn't choose genocide even as he pursues an alliance with Hitler, and even if he did, Roth prefers the subletly of Lindbergh pressuring Jews through collaborators including a Rabbi and Roth's own aunt (this is a fictionalized \\"what if\\" autobiography!)to assimilate, with Jewish-Americans deported to forest CCC style camps in Kentucky, but not for extermination - at least in this novel. Roth prefers subletly ala the quiet horror of Nevil Shute's \\"On The Beach\\" which foresaw the end of mankind after a devastating nuclear war. Indeed, Roth too, is a major character, a little boy who watches as his parents suffer through lost of employment and the constant pressure of losing their Jewish identity as Lindbergh's neo-Nazis spread their influence throughout America. He hopes, as do others, but the fear is always there. <br /> <br />\\"The Plot Against America\\" isn't quite as horrific as Eric Norden's alternative history of a \\"Judenrein\\" world in \\"Ultimate Solution\\" where Patton and MacArthur are hanged under Lindbergh's orders after the Nazi Atom Bombings of Detroit and Pittsburgh, where perversion is the norm, and all Jews throughout Europe and the United States are exterminated by homegrown fascists (including former American army officers) as the Reich prepares for Atomic War with a Japan that still harbors a few surviving Jews. Also - Roth displays his own personal prejudices and hangups by making Lindbergh a Republican. Lindbergh was an \\"American Firster\\" and while many prominent Republicans did endorse isolationism, the party leadership had lined up solidly behind Roosevelt's  Lend-Lease and other prepardness policies; on the other hand, there were many in Roosevelt's own party, from the notorious Soviet agent and Nazi sympathizer Ernest Lundeen whose death in an air crash deprived both Hitler and Stalin of one of their biggest American sycophants; or Joe Kennedy, yes, that Joe Kennedy who did his level best to undermine the British fight against Hitlerism while he was FDR's ambassador in London, and the Dixiecrat Jew-baiters and Negro-haters such as John Rankin and Theodore Bilbo, whom Roosevelt feared to discipline even though they were Lynch-Law enthusiasts. <br /> <br />No, both parties had their fascist sycophants and sympathizers, but the chances of a Lindbergh being nominated by the Democrats was just as great as his being nominated by the Republicans in 1940; the only difference being that there was already a Democratic President - FDR - in place. <br /> <br />Still, \\"Plot\\"'s storyline was entirely plausible, and yes, it could have happened here. And no matter if Roth is a creep, he scores a bullseye with this it could really have happened here tale.	2004-09-25

He doesn't stop there, chronicling how the Vichyite regime of Chirac ships tons of advanced weaponry to countries like Iran and Syria, or how Putin's \\"democratic\\" Russia, itself undergoing a terrifying terror war that recently saw the savage murder of hundreds of children, also doesn't mind helping our enemies in both the Islamofascist world and in North Korea - or a China that floods the American market with toys - but also has flooded the arms stockpiles of murder groups like Al Qaeda and Hamas.    To the previous reviewer who compared this to the shipment of arms to the Contras - it really isn't worth a comment except that the Contras helped bring democracy to Nicaragua whereas his taliban, al qaeda and hamas friends have brought nothing but terror and savagery to the world.     Gertz to his credit (and while I thought him to be a bit \\"over the top\\" in previous books) cites documents, sources, and facts to buttress his case that our so-called allies are NOT. Chirac might be John Kerry's friend - but his actions time and time again have proven he is NO friend of America. The French will not, even under a Kerry administration, help us in Iraq, but as Gertz points out, they will never fail to provide aid and comfort to our enemies.

While I was able to make contact with many vets in the Lincoln Battalion, sad to say, Mr. Cane had passed on before I had a chance to contact him. His obituary told of his valor, and of his idealism, and while he was, yes, a member of the Communist Party USA while in Spain and serving heroically in the United States Army in World War II, Larry Cane had the intellectual honesty to walk away from the horrendous Stalinist sewer once he was aware of its true evil. <br /> <br />His son is to be profusely thanked for releasing this correspondence of a man - yes, a Leftist, but whose Jewish background, perhaps even more so than his CP affiliation, made this man - a decision to fight evil and oppression and believe in the unity of all mankind. Cane writes movingly of the D-Day Battle, of coming across emanciated Jewish concentration camp survivors in Germany, of his pride in America, of being a Jew, and yes, of being a Communist and pride in the Soviet Union as the ally that it was (of course then being unaware of what a murderous fascist Joe Stalin really was). He writes of the common soldiers that he served alongside with, and there is correspondence from some of them that attest to Cane's own bravery in battle. And he writes of his love of his family and of the baby son who now has been able to bring this unique correspondence to publication. <br /> <br />Larry Cane earned the Silver Star and a Battlefield Commission to the rank of Captain in the United States Army for his heroism on the battlefields of France after D-Day, and for his role in helping to smash the Hitlerian evil. A worthy read for all Americans interested in our \\"Greatest Generation\\" - and in the unique experiences of those who bravely chose to fight Hitlerism in Spain before the world recognized what was at stake for all mankind. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-23

After two first-rate \\"what if\\" books covering alternative endings of major events in World History, Cowley and his distinguished coterie of authors (James McPherson, Jay Winik, Caleb Carr, Cecilia Holland, et. al.,) have taken on the major events of American History and have provided a fresh view and sometimes not too pleasant alternative endings to them.    Consider this: Jay Winik's \\"John Wilkes Booth's Wildest Dream\\" - a Union angered by the assassination of Lincoln enacting retribution on Southern leaders, with the South in turn resorting to widespread guerrilla warfare, which by the time Grant takes office, is practically uncontrollable. Winik had already alluded to the possible horror of guerrilla warfare had Lee NOT surrendered at Appomattox; here he elaborates on it.    In another essay, Anthony Beevor writes an intriguing \\"what if\\" Eisenhower had given the \\"green light\\" for American forces to seize Berlin ahead of the advancing Red Army in the spring of 1945, and the probable consequences of such an order. We now know that Stalin was prepared to order Red Army commanders to open fire if the U.S. 9th Army had entered the city.     Or a Nuclear Holocaust where the United States, having experienced a Soviet tactical nuclear response in Cuba, and several strikes on the United States itself, resulting in the deaths of both JFK and Lyndon Johnson, resorts to a massive Nuclear assault on the Soviet Union? A quarter of a million Americans are killed, but that is nothing compared to the virtual obliteration of the old USSR, where only a tenth of the population survive the American air and sea bomber and missile assaults - and the world is so revulsed by this overkill that America is ostracized for the next three decades. Wow!     And that is just the tip of the alternative history iceberg...consider a Nixon Presidency that survived Watergate, or an America wracked by Labor Strife in 1877!    About the only faults that I can find in this remarkable work is the regurgitation of James McPherson's brilliant essay on an alternative Antietam which turned in a Lee victory at Gettysburg, an \\"event\\" already visited in the first \\"What If\\" volume. Also no alternative 9/11 or war on terror essay, as this book ends with Nixon and Vietnam. It also might have been fascinating to see alternative endings to Little Big Horn, where Custer was victorious over Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, or a turn of events in the Spanish-American War. Hope Mr. Cowley and his associates will take on these and other events next time around.	2004-09-22

Even in a Republican state like Arizona Buckey O'Neill is a state hero - and much revered in Prescott. <br /> <br />This son of an Irish immigrant and Civil War Veteran risked death many times, chasing outlaws across the deserts and praries. If he hadn't recklessly strolled along the front lines facing the Spanish emplacements on San Juan Hill, O'Neill might very well had gone on to bigger and better things, including possibly being territorial governor. He was a particular favorite of Theodore Roosevelt's, who took his death very hard. <br /> <br />Dale Walker has already written a superb book about the \\"Rough Riders\\" in the \\"Boys of '98\\" and here he sets the record on the man who is arguably Arizona's favorite son - above and beyond t Goldwater, the Earps, and perhaps even John McCain. Only the late hero Pat Tillman's life and career might be as adventurous and as legendary as O'Neill's was.	2004-09-06

Grant: The American Presidents Series: The 18th President, 1869-1877	Books	4	26	30	N	N	Very Good, But Not the Best in U.S Grant Literature	It has been U.S. Grant's misfortune to rank behind Lincoln and Lee in the pantheon of the major notable Civil War heroes. A Presidency racked by scandal though largely not of his fault didn't help matters. But Grant was a winner - and that's what counts. From defeating the \\"Marble Man\\" Lee to his courageous drive to finish his memoirs as Cancer was taking his life, Grant showed nobility and character, which is the foci of Josiah Bunting's brief tome in this volume of \\"The American Presidents\\" series. <br /> <br />In focusing on the character and the nobility of Grant, Bunting does take a different perspective, though by no means new view of this subject. Indeed, Mark Feely, Jean Edward Smith, and to a lesser degree Geoffrey Perrett have already covered and done justice to Grant's character in their works - and I would recommend both Feely and Perrett to the Grant novice, not to mention his \\"Memoirs\\". I might also note that the late Stephen Ambrose, in his \\"To America\\" wrote a very lengthy essay on why Grant was a good President - not just a great General, and how he did do his best to stop the resurgence of segregation and anti-Black animus in the post-Civil War South, and why he could not succeed. <br /> <br />This isn't to say that Professor Bunting's book does not deserve a wide readership - it does. But do check out Feely, Perrett, and Smith first, and above all, get a copy of those \\"Personal Memoirs\\" - they are by far the best memoirs ever penned by an American President, and a classic of American Literature.	2004-09-05

The truth, of course, is more complex.<br /><br />For while Wilson talks a good talk about the grovelling Senators who fawned upon Saddam (true), he and his predecessor, Miss Glaspie, were diehard Arabists who aided and abetted that kind of mindset.<br /><br />Yes, Wilson did behave courageously in standing up to Saddam's thugs and in shielding those who sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy after Saddam invaded Kuwait. But even a critic of U.S. Middle East policy like John Simpson of the BBC is considered Wilson personally to be a disaster. He was arrogant and a bully, according to Simpson. And this self-serving book proves it.<br /><br />Wilson, like many other Arabists and those in the hypocritical Left dismisses the need to take action against Iraq. He is also upset because someone - and who knows, he might even turn out to be one of his Liberal friends yet - blew the cover on his wife. The other main point of the book is Wilson's assertion that Saddam was NOT seeking enriched uranium in Africa. That, of all things, has been proven wrong by the 9/11 Commisssion, not exactly a fanclub of President Bush!<br /><br />Furthermore, American forces in Baghdad during the early days of the Liberation came across a heavily radioactive area not far from the Tigris river - something \\"our\\" press only briefly reported on, and both U.S. and Polish forces have found small amounts of WMDs - maybe not as much as the administration claimed that would be found, but hey, Saddam had three months, thanks to France, Russia, Germany and the U.N., to smuggle what he had across the Syrian (or Iranian) border, something that the ostriches in the sand, i.e., the Democrats and their French friends refuse to acknowledge. And neither does the VERY discredited Joe Wilson.<br /><br />Wilson's book is worth one thing though - it is a compelling reason to overhaul the State Department and the Foreign Service. We need more hard-headed realists, and yes, Neo-Cons, and much less self-serving types like Joe Wilson, Richard Clarke, and Randy Beers.reason to overhaul the State Department and the Foreign Service.

If Moore had stopped there, he might be regarded as a populist hero in the Woody Guthrie mode fighting for the jobs of laid-off American workers. <br /> <br />But then came \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" with its savage, unwarranted attack on Charlton Heston, which began to show the world what a boorish bully Moore really was - and increasingly, Moore began to reveal his true colors, an anti-American view of the world and a hate of President Bush. <br /> <br />Since then we've had the farce \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" - a Moor-on ranting and raving at the Academy Awards, and \\"Dude, Where Is My Country\\" whom Moore dedicates to the cheerleader of the Palestinian genocidal bombers, one Rachel Corrie, who was dumb enough to connect with a bulldozer. Moore goes to Cannes, and talks about \\"stupid\\" Americans - while millions of those \\"stupid\\" Americans flock to see a film that is essentially propaganda of the Leni Riefenstahl variety. <br /> <br />And Michael Moore, fat, unshaven, slovenly, a slob talks of being a \\"regular\\" guy while flying around in private jets, living it up in Manhatten, not in Podunk, and berating his private staff. Nice guy. <br /> <br />The two authors of this book to their credit reveal what Michael Moore is all about - and he is as loathsome as he looks. They reveal the lies and twisting of the facts in all of his films and books, especially the one where the President allowed the Bin Laden family to flee America right after 9/11. In fact it was Richard Clarke and presumably his minion, Randy Beers, who is now John Kerry's National Security Adviser, who gave the go-ahead for the Bin Ladens to exit - and only after the FBI vetted them. So much for the canard that the Bush family covered up the departure of their \\"friends\\" the Bin Ladens. <br /> <br />About the only fault of this book is that it iswritten in the same choppy, \\"in your face\\" style of most attack books - the majority of them Left - written these days. Franken, Arianna, Press, Coulter, and of course boorish bully himself. Otherwise it is a perfect gift for the Moveon.Org, Howie Dean, or Mikey Moore fan. They need a potent dosage of the truth about this fat fascist.	2004-09-05

Another 400 or so lost their lives as members of the United States Armed Forces during World War II.   <br /> <br />Harry Fisher tells of his motivation in going to Spain - fighting poverty on the lower East Side of New York, joining the Young Communist League, concerns about Hitler and Fascism. He writes poignantly of friends who never came home, like Butch Entin, whose ambulance was blown up by Fascist airplanes; or of the Stone Brothers - two of whom lost their lives within days of each other. He writes of little human interest stories too - of finding a genuine Jewish restaurant - complete with Gefilte Fish, Chicken Soup, Roast Chicken, in a little apartment on a side street in Barcelona and how good the food was, even though the owners were rumored to be \\"Trotskyites\\". <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this is where Fisher loses his moral compass. For Harry Fisher came home and went to work for TASS, the Soviet bureau of Lies and Propaganda. He learned very little from the Hitler-Stalin Pact, or even from the Khruschev revelations of how murderous Uncle Joe Stalin was - or how he hated Jews as much as his friend Schicklgruber. He apparently either remained a Communist (Stalinist) Party member to the end of his days - or at any rate, remained close to the Party. <br /> <br />Fisher also, unfortunately, chose to put one Oliver Law on a pedestal, even though Law, a Black American Communist was regarded by many Lincoln veterans as the most incompetent of the Comintern-chosen American commanders in Spain. Fisher claimed that Law was killed gallantly facing the Fascists; other former Lincoln vets, including William Herrick, whose \\"Jumping the Line\\" is the most honest account of an anti-Fascist Lincoln vet ever written, claim that Law was possibly shot by his own men after leading the Lincolns into ambush after ambush. <br /> <br />The literature - and the first hand accounts of Americans who fought Hitlerism in Spain are few and far-between, and Fisher's book, like Herrick's is a valuable resource. Unfortunately for Fisher, while his decision to go and fight Fascism is to be admired, his affiliation with TASS not only leaves much to be desired - but also is an advisement to the reader to take much of the idelogy lurking in the background with a grain of salt. <br /> <br />Read \\"Jumping The Line\\". Herrick may not have served in Spain as long as Fisher did, but it is a far more solid - and honest - work.	2004-09-02

Not only is Diana Preston a wonderful narrative historian but she is an effervescent speaker too. <br /> <br />William Dampier sailed the globe three times; came up with the words and descriptions for \\"barbeque\\" and \\"marijuana\\" among other terms; his studies of wind currents and how they affect navigation are still used today, and it was Dampier who was the first White explorer to discover Australia well before Captain Cook ever cast his eyes on the Oz shores. The great men of England during his time knew and admired this rugged yet erudite buccaneer. <br /> <br />Yet today Dampier is sadly forgotten but for maybe a paragraph, two at the most, in most histories, and little more in even works on discovery and exploration. Even in his native England, Dampier has been relegated to obscurity.  <br /> <br />In this remarkable book Diana and Michael Preston not only have set the record straight on Dampier's brilliant accomplishments, they have also shed some light on this great man's personality and the reasons why he is largely unknown to this day. This is narrative history worth reading, especially for those interested in the age of seafaring, of pirates and buccaneers, and of discovery and exploration.	2004-09-01

Buchanan Went Wrong	Patrick J. Buchanan may have once been an important though erratic and eccentric figure in Conservative politics. For example, Mr. Buchanan pointed out the obvious problems of illegal - not legal - immigration decades before anyone else had the cojones to do so, and the dire impact of his prophecy has sadly come true in border states like California and Arizona. <br /> <br />However, when Mr. Buchanan became a senior policy adviser for the late President Reagan, he lost touch with his moral compass. He became enarmored with Nazi War Criminals, and was in the forefront of those who advised Reagan to make that ill-fated trip to the SS cemetery in Bitburg, Germany. Furthermore Buchanan supported the rights of Nazi War Criminals and took one step further, he practically endorsed Yasser Arafat's terror war against Israel. <br /> <br />Now Mr. Buchanan has chosen to write a \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" diatribe against the \\"Neo-Conservative\\" advisers to both President Reagan and the current President Bush. He has all but called them acolytes of Ariel Sharon, and things worse. Buchanan has always been regarded as a \\"conspiracy theorist\\" but now has chosen to march in goosestep with Israel-bashers, and may I dare add, America-haters like Robert KKK Byrd, Howard Dean, Michael Moore and George Soros. Or the myriads of those in groups like MoveOn, International Solidarity, ANSWER, and other fringe groups on the left side of the Democratic Party camp. <br /> <br />Never mind that this effectively takes Mr. Buchanan out of the Conservative camp, nor never mind that Mr. Buchanan in his myopic hatred of Neo-Cons seems to have forgotten that they, i.e., Jeane Kilpatrick, Richard Perle, Elliot Abrams, Paul Wolfowitz, and others not were in the forefront of those who stood up to the appeasement and disarmament policies of Jimmy Carter early on (Jay Winik has written a superb book about them) they also not only let \\"Reagan be Reagan\\" much more effectively than Patrick J. ever did, but they have done a superb job (unless you subscribe to Patrick J. - or John Kerry's worldview) in advising President Bush in the war on terrorism. Sure, they regard Israel as a vital ally in the war against terror - who in their right mind wouldn't??? <br /> <br />This book is a nothing more than a sad, mean rant. It is a choppy read, an isolationist tome, like most of Patrick J.'s other works, and a diatribe against Jewish Conservative Republicans. Patrick doesn't deserve a Conservative audience anymore - he belongs with Mikey Moore and the weirdos of moveon.org	2004-09-01

Newell covered the same ground as Mr. Lesser some years ago in his classic \\"Lee vs. McClellan\\" but what Mr. Lesser has done in \\"Rebels at the Gate\\" is take a fine portrait of the bitter, brother versus brother fighting in the hills of West Virginia and turned it into a landscape. He writes movingly of the Rebel General Garnett, who upon taking the West Virginia assignment to stop the Union forces knew he would die there; of little Josie Gordon, the 18 year son of a Union major, who enlisted in the Union Army much against the wishes of his father, and would be found dead on the battlefield by his heartbroken father.  <br /> <br />He also writes of spies, of bushwackers like the deadly Nancy Hart, a little spitfire who killed a Union jailer taking her photo, of the various West Virginia politicians who clamored to 'secede' themselves from the Confederacy, and the figures of history, - Stonewall Jackson, George McClellan, Robert E. Lee, and the sarcastic \\"bitter\\" (Ambrose) Bierce, whose Civil War experience, which began in West Virginia, had a profound impact on his future writings. <br /> <br />As a previous reviewer has noted, Lesser has a storyteller's gift, but he also knows his history. A worthy work to place alongside the Newell book, if you can still get a copy.	2004-08-29

If it were a couple of disgruntled vets with perhaps a bone to pick with Kerry, that would be one thing, but for scores of them, and many who don't even have a bone to pick with the guy except for his character flaws and his inability to tell the truth, that is quite another thing altogether.    Furthermore, the head of the Swift Boats, John McNeill comes across as a honest, patriotic and credible spokesperson. Remember, he debated Kerry on Dick Cavett back then, and apparently wiped the ground with him.    In this book Kerry enlists - and that he deserves credit for - but enlisted already with strong views against the war. He goes over, gets a minor wound which according to his own journals came not from enemy fire but for recklessly tossing a grenade, then asks for a Purple Heart! Kerry also talks about Christmas in Cambodia, which he now says he was near Cambodia and it was after the New Year! (is this the 87 million vote flip-flop all over again?) What is most upsetting, and this according to several vets who witnessed it was Kerry's apparent decision to go into a deserted village and slaughter the domesticated animals - pigs, chickens - left behind.    Then he comes home, links up with a guy named Al Hubbard, who never served in Vietnam despite claims to the contrary, but a guy who had strong times to the Communist Party USA and besmirches his fellow vets. This from a guy who appeared before the American people and said he was \\"reporting for duty\\"! A guy who decrys the treatment rendered a Max Cleland but whose own campaign literature besmirches Ollie North.  Furthermore, the Vietnam Veterans Against the War apparently made secret contacts with those killing Americans at the time. Kerry may or may not have been involved, but he knew about these contacts through his buddy Hubbard.    The Swift Boats men don't discuss Kerry's subsequent \\"tour of duty\\" in the U.S. Senate where he voted against every major defense and intelligence bill as much as they should, but then again, they don't need to. It is all part of the public record if anyone cares to look at it.That 19 year record, I might add, is a pretty pathetic one for someone who pounds the lectern as he says he will defend this country as \\"commander-in-chief\\" (after voting against every major weapons system, improving our intelligence capabilities, and almost anything related to the United States Armed Forces)    \\"Reporting for Duty\\"???    Again, even if only a fraction of \\"Unfit for Command\\" is true, and whether or not you think these men are partisan vultures - do we really want to entrust our lives with someone like John Kerry?    At least pick up the book and read it before drawing your own conclusions.	2004-08-17
US	52532871	R3L6XKUGSCMNF1	1577470354	651273007	Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Squandered Opportunity	I picked up Eric Wittenberg's \\"Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions\\" half expecting a rehash of the epic fight between George Custer and Jeb Stuart at Rummel's Farm on the 3rd Day of the Battle. Indeed I was humming \\"Garry Owen\\" to myself until I opened the book. <br /> <br />Witrenberg gives the reader a fascinating account of the Union cavalry assaults led by Wesley Merritt and Judson \\"Kilcavalry\\" Kilpatrick on the Confederate Left flank at the time of the repulse of Pickett's Charge, and culminating in Kilpatrick's insane decision to send Elon Farnsworth and his brigade to charge across a fenced-in, rocky terrain on the slopes of the Round Tops, a charge that ended in the decimation of the Union cavalry and the heroic death of Farnsworth. <br /> <br />The new ground covered here is Wittenberg's strong assertion that if the cavalry had not been sent in piecemeal, Merritt's men charging on foot just west of the Emmitsburg Road, and the doomed charge of Farnsworth towards the Confederates entrenched by the Round Tops, but had been sent in together, the Confederate line would have been turned, and with Union cavalry pouring through, Pickett's retreat might have turned into a full rout of the Army of Northern Virginia - and even the surrender of Lee on the Gettysburg Battlefield. Indeed, as Wittenberg points out, Merritt's charge actually did turn the flank of the Confederate line for a short time, but without support either from Kilpatrick or Union Infantry on the Round Tops it was doomed to fail.  <br /> <br />Whether or not one buys Wittenberg's premise, he provides the Civil War and particularly Gettysburg student with new insights and food for thought. While Custer's battle with Stuart is very well known, and even Farnsworth's charge merits a few sentences in most Gettysburg histories, the details of Merritt's operations are almost completely unknown.  <br /> <br />To be sure, this is a slim volume that did not run in a precise chronological narrative. The reader has to switch chapters back and forth to see what Merritt was doing at a particular time, or what Kilpatrick was doing at that same time. Instead Wittenberg had Farnsworth's charge, the climax of the cavalry operations near the beginning of the book, while Merritt's assault, which took place a few hours earlier, is near the end of the book.  Good maps, again not in chronological order, and many illustrations hitherto not seen by this reader. Also Wittenberg casts light on the bloody sideshow at Fairfield between the 6th U.S. Cavalry and Confederate cavalry under the irascible \\"Grumble\\" Jones, an affair that ended the killing and capture of the majority of this elite Union unit. Merritt had diluted the potency of his force by sending these men, whose services would have been much more valuable on South Cavalry field, on a foolhardy search for Confederate supply wagons, and instead they ended up running into a Rebel beehive.	2004-08-14

Burns was able to capture the whole panorama of the history of the West, and left no stone unturned. Here was the saga of the pioneers, the cruelty of the buffalo hunters, the tragedy of the Native Americans, the bravery of Custer - and of Crazy Horse and Chief Joseph, the terrible \\"die up\\" where thousands of poor cattle froze to death in the Montana blizzards, and the courage and perserverence of settlers like the Loves. The musical score too was perfect, capturing every dramatic movement, every nuance just right. <br /> <br />And the book too, while perhaps not as comprehensive as Geoffrey Ward's earlier \\"Civil War\\" volume, provided the viewer with a superb text and many, never-before-seen illustrations. The reader can sense the drama of the Earps and Wild Bill Hickok, can hope that Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce reach Canada and safety (which they didn't) and feel the heartbreak when Joseph was cruelly denied the return to his homeland. The reader can also cheer for the courtship of the Loves, and almost live the toil, the disappointments, and the determination of that family through the text, the first-hand accounts, and the marvellous illustrations. I found myself getting angry over the Mountain Meadows Massacre and the Mormon scapegoating of the Paiutes; being sickened and almost in tears over the slaughter of the buffalo, and the old Native American woman's tale of how the last buffalo went into Mount Scott, never to return; and in appreciating how Buffalo Bill Cody and Theodore Roosevelt did their level best in trying to save the West that they loved - Cody through the Wild West shows, and Roosevelt through his conservation efforts. <br /> <br />It is all here in Mr. Ward's excellent text, and more. There may be other books on the West, but for the perfect introduction to anyone interested in Western History, or even for the grizzled enthusiast, this book is not only the perfect companion to the series, it is also a perfect coffee table pictorial history of a history and a lifestyle that is all but gone.	2004-08-08

The \\"Rough Riders\\" is Roosevelt's classic story of these highly motivated volunteers who eagerly volunteered to fight in the Spanish-American war, and whom many, including the regular army officer Capron, the Arizona sheriff O'Neill, Fish and others paid the ultimate price. And not all of the nearly 1000 men who volunteered ever made it over to Cuba. Several troops, to their everlasting sorrow, and nearly all of the horses had to stay in Tampa, the port of embarkation, because of a lack of troopships.    Roosevelt tells the entire story, which helped catapult him to the Presidency, of the feisty former Confederate Cavalry commander Joseph Wheeler, who commanded all of the volunteer cavalry, and who, to the amusement of his men, blurted out at Las Guismas, \\"We've got the damn Yankees on the run\\" - momentarily lapsing into Chickamauga, not Cuba!, and of how San Juan Hill was stormed and captured under intense fire from Spanish rifles, gatling guns, and cannon, and giving praise not just to his own men, but to the accompanying Black Cavalrymen of the 9th and 10th cavalry, and of the regular infantry units that were involved in the operation.     The colorful and fact-based story of brave American men who fought for the freedom of others, now sadly under totalitarian rule. A Classic slice of Americana written by one of America's best.	2004-08-08

Bill and Jan Moeller have taken a new approach in telling the stirring story of George Armstrong Custer, the places where he lived, fought and died. The approach is a photographic one, not of the dashing Cavalry hero but of geographic places where he walked, rode, fought, lived - and died. Places like the farm house of his boyhood home in Ohio, the towers at West Point,and the serene green landscape alongside the Hudson, of the cannons at Manassas, his first Civil War battle, of the blue skies and open field at Brandy Station, the site of the biggest Cavalry fight on North American soil, and of another open field, that one alongside Rummel's farm at place called Gettysburg.    The Moellers continue this photographic journey, through the beautiful flowers and plant overgrowth of that terrible place called the Wilderness, to the bushy ground of Yellow Tavern, where Jeb Stuart was mortally wounded by a soldier under Custer's command, into the beautiful Shenandoah Valley, and on to a place called Appomattox, where their frames captured the beautiful and tranquil southern home where Lee surrendered to Grant.    Then out west, to the desolate brown flatlands of the Oklahoma territory, to the plains where the buffalo roamed (and still do), and on to those desolate Black Hills, and a date with destiny at a greasy grass filled hillside not far from a stream called the Little Big Horn. Throughout this journey, the Moellers provide the reader with strikingly beautiful all-color photographs that capture the natural beauty and the drama of the places associated with Custer. There is also a fine text equal to a mini-biography of Custer. And not one image of him, save for the striking statue on the cover. And not one contemporary photograph or illustration either.    I believe that the Custer book was the first photo-history that the Moellers chose to do. Since then they have covered the Oregon Trail, Lewis and Clark, Chief Joseph, and Crazy Horse, among other topics. But their Custer book represents their best work, and while the original hardcover is out-of-print and a rarity at used book stores, they have reprinted this slim volume in a paperback edition found here. If you are a Custer enthusiast, or just interested in Western history captured in remarkable photographs,  this is a worthy and very unique book to include in  your collection.	2004-08-06
US	52532871	R2HDTW4WQFLA4L	B0001CJ9I6	220335700	Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Gripping, Terrific Narrative of how Gettysburg Unfolded	Day by day, hour by hour. <br />  <br /> I was honored to host and have lunch with Noah Andre Trudeau a couple of years ago when he was doing a short tour to promote &quot;Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage&quot;. Over a Quizno sandwich lunch we talked briefly about Cavalry operations at Gettysburg, of missed opportunities, of the personalities, and of some of the myths about the battle (Lee muttering &quot;It's All My Fault&quot;, Chamberlain may have been heroic at Little Round Top, but it just wasn't the 20th Maine nor did fixed bayonets save the day). I had promised Trudeau then that I would review his book - a couple of years later, I'm keeping that promise on the bargain edition! <br />  <br /> Trudeau's account is a solid one because he chooses to mix analysis, which could be a turn-off with a gripping narrative that manages to take the reader to the various dramas taking place on the battlefield without making his or her head spin. He also starts his book with how the Gettysburg campaign unfolded - and yes, Lee wasn't as much interested in taking Washington, D.C. as wracking havoc in Pennsylvania and Maryland, and upsetting the Union home front so that the people of the North would demand an end to war. He also covers the &quot;first&quot; occupation of Gettysburg, when Confederate Cavalry and Infantry under Jubal Early routed the small groups of militia and cavalry under the brave Captain Robert Bell, and entered the town several days before the actual battle (I wish he had mention what became of Bell and his horsemen, who fought a courageous fight against overwhelming odds). <br />  <br /> Trudeau also argues that once the battle commenced, Lee's strategy was a sound one, but that he should have relied more on Longstreet whom history portrayed as a culprit but if his advice on turning the Union flank had been followed, as Newt Gingrich and other alternative history writers have suggested, the battle may very well have ended in a Southern victory. Trudeau isalso sympathetic to Daniel Sickles, stating that Sickles decision to move forward out of the hilly ground by the Round Tops was also a sound strategic one, as he had expected Union reserves to move in behind and occupy the Round Tops once he moved his corps forwarded. The reasons why it did not happen, and why disaster struck Sickles' corps are generally answered. <br />  <br /> Trudeau also covers in gripping detail the Cavalry actions of the third day while Pickett's charge is unfolding, but not just Custer versus Stuart at Rummel's Farm, but the piecemail, reckless assaults by &quot;Kilcavalry&quot; Kilpatrick and Wesley Merritt by the side of the Round Tops. If Merritt and Kilpatrick had succeeded, the Confederate flank would have been turned just as Pickett had been repulsed, and an orderly retreat would have turned into a rout, and perhaps even a Confederate surrender. That was not to be.  <br />  <br /> The maps keep the narrative alive, but honestly, illustrations, photos, paintings would have been appreciated, and fact I even asked him why there weren't any - to which he responded that most of the other works had already included them. That might be so, but there is always something to be said for the visual as it keeps a historical work in focus. Still deserving of four stars for the strong narrative, new insights about men like Lee, Sickles, and Chamberlain, and great (hour by hour) maps.	2004-08-05

There had been Draft Riots on the streets of New York only the year before. The war itself was not going well for the North, and the fighting had grinded down to a stalemate along the Rappahanock River in Virginia, and in the mountains of Northern Georgia.Many were beginning to believe that Robert E. Lee was invincible. There were many in the North, especially the Ohio Congressman Clement Vallandingham, who urged &quot;peace at any price&quot; - including Southern Independence and a repeal of the Emancipation Proclamation. <br />  <br /> There were pressures for Lincoln to remove his loyal Vice President, Hannibal Hamlin, and replace him with a &quot;War Democrat&quot; - which he did. <br />  <br /> And the Democrats on a solid Anti-War platform chose the war hero turned peace advocate Major General George McClellan as their Presidential candidate, with the anti-war George Pendleton as his running mate. <br />  <br /> Sound Familiar??? <br />  <br /> How Lincoln turned it all around, captured the hearts and minds of the nation (with a little help from Union victories at Mobile Bay, Atlanta, and the Shenandoah Valley), and how people were convinced that George McClellan, who ironically did not like the platform he ran on, was not the right choice for the nation, is the basis of John Waugh's excellent, readable and dramatic book. He takes you to the cabinet meetings, the conventions, the behind-the-scenes machinations of the Lincoln supporters, John C. Fremont, McClellan and the Democrats, and even what the press was reporting (and it wasn't favorably inclined towards Abraham Lincoln). <br />  <br /> The parallels between 1864 and 2004 are pretty eeery. But if that alone piques your curiosity, what you will find in this book is solid History. The bargain hardcover is no longer available, but a new trade paperback edition has just been released - and just in time for the 2004 election! <br />  <br />	2004-08-05

While many might question the results of the Iraq war, the failure to find WMD's (anyone care to check in Syria or Iraq - thanks to the U.N. and France, Saddam Hussein had three months to smuggle anything he might have had across those porous borders!), or whether we should have sent in a much larger force, the results of Frank's lightning campaign - Baghdad in less than three months, the destruction of the Republican Guard, the capture of Saddam Hussein and practically all of the Baathist leadership it is quite an accomplishment, much more so than what Schwarzkopf did in the original Gulf War.      Remember, it was also Franks who oversaw the operations that ended the rule of the bestial Taliban in Afghanistan in and smashed Al-Qaeda into a pulp - a dangerous pulp to be sure, but a pulp whose cowardly pig has to hide in a cave - so much for martyrdom...      PERHAPS our military should have put more resources into Afghanistan; PERHAPS we should have &quot;taken out&quot; Al-Zarqari in the beginning of Enduring Freedom; PERHAPS... Franks is indeed critical of our intelligence failures but also provides a strong account that they too were also the failures of our allies. Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan were also talking &quot;up&quot; WMDs to Franks right to the beginning of the war.PERHAPS we should have sent in a much larger force to Iraq (Franks also addresses that and the &quot;armchair general mentality&quot;). But honestly, could John Kerry or Wesley Clark, whose own heroism pales to that of Franks, done any better? And what Tommy Franks and his Generals did, in spite of the on-going &quot;insurgencies&quot; (read: terrorists) in both Iraq and Afghanistan was nothing short of brilliant.      To know what kind of man serves in our armed forces, and in doing so, serves to preserve our freedoms, and to know where we might be heading in the war against terrorism, read &quot;American Soldier&quot;.	2004-08-04

The Rage of the Left, the Truth, and What to Do About It	Books	5	96	123	N	N	Our Country Right or Wrong - This book is a Wake-Up Call!	A group of us recently met for dinner with a well-known radio talk-show host in the Los Angeles area. While the main foci of the dinner-table discussion was about the Civil War, our talk-show guest, who would be considered a Liberal politically, though he hates labels, sadly lamented how polarized this country has become. It came at no surprise to me that he likened the red-hot political divide between those who support the President to the Bush-haters to the atmosphere in this nation just prior to 1860. <br />  <br /> Thankfully this nation is not, God Forbid, on the verge of a violent split. However, it did remind me very much of another Presidential election, the one held 140 years ago between Abraham Lincoln and the Union War Hero George McClellan nominated on an anti-war, pro-peace (with the Confederacy) platform drafted by an equally anti-war, pro-peace and disunion Democratic Party (sound familiar??).  <br />  <br /> I later mentioned the comparisons to this speaker, and while agreeing that it wasn't quite the same - after all, America in 1864 was in the midst of a Civil War, the comparisons of personalities, a President who was a Republican and hated by many; a war-hero turned Peace Democratic candidate, were pretty much on the mark. <br />  <br /> (Read John Waugh's EXCELLENT &quot;Reelecting Lincoln&quot;) <br />  <br /> Ben Stein's book not only also makes similiar references to the Civil War and why we must stop ourselves from tearing this great country apart, he points his brilliant finger at those who are causing the greatest harm, and takes no prisoners. He equally savages the media, the Howard Deans, George Soros' and Michael Moores who have nothing good to say about America, the Left Fascist college professors who instead of teaching our children are indoctrinating them with &quot;hate America&quot; lies. <br />  <br /> Stein shows how stupid and harmful those Left Wing Pundits ala Michael Moore and Janeane Garofalo among others are when they have the gall to call America &quot;Fascist&quot; as Garofalo recently alluded that we are. He points out that in every war that we fought to save Europe, we never conquered any European country, unlike the Germans and the Russians, nor slaughtered anyone. All we wanted in the end, as he said this morning on &quot;Dayside&quot; was to have a little corner in those ungrateful lands like France to bury our boys who died to bring freedom to these lands. <br />  <br /> The book also contains a great bibliography of American History and Civil War source material for further reading. <br />  <br /> This is a must-book that not only should belong in every thinking American's personal library, but should be given to every student going off to a college campus so that they know - and can refute the Hate America sludge of the Zinns and the Chomskys. Thank you for this book, Ben, and for real humor, real intellectual honesty, and the truth unlike a &quot;Stuart Smalley&quot;  <br />  <br />	2004-08-04

So, if you are already biased and are inclined to blame Israel for Palestinian terrorism, or if you don't wish &quot;to be confused by the facts&quot;* - or the blunt truth as it is, this book isn't for you. But if you are open-minded and wish to know more about the realities of the Israeli-Arab Conflicts, this is a must book to read, along with David Fromkin's &quot;A Peace to End All Peace&quot;. <br />  <br /> *I had recommended this book to a gentleman who had been studying the problems between Arab and Jew, and had in fact been reading books by Benny Morris and Tom Segev, two Israeli Leftists very biased towards the PLO (Morris has had somewhat of a change of heart since Arafat's Intifada began). The man, a Leftist of Jewish background, was one of those who wouldn't even take a look at this book. So again, if I'm not preaching to the converted, and if you do have an open mind and can deal with the facts, this is a must-read. <br />  <br />	2004-08-03

You'll find entries about the best and worst Civil War Generals, the Best Regiments, the strangest hairstyles (Ambrose &quot;Sideburns&quot; Burnside an obvious choice), the ugliest generals (Nathan Bedford Forrest occupies a prominent spot here),and Generals who served in the Mexican War,and the Union and Confederate Generals who helped unite the country 33 years after Appomattox by their service as U.S. Army Generals in the Spanish-American War. They include Union Cavalry Generals Wesley Merritt and James Harrison Wilson, both contemporaries of George Armstrong Custer; and Confederate Generals like &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Wheeler and Robert E. Lee's nephew and cavalry commander under Jeb Stuart Fitzhugh Lee.      There are entries on women who served, Black-Americans, Native Americans and significant actions (though victories by Stand Watie are curiously omitted), on foreign born officers on both sides, and even on Jewish Medal of Honor Winners - six of them.       Even fairly comprehensive lists of casualties. The Union losses in battle or died of disease are fairly accurate, the Confederate ones ??? (they're not broken down as completely as the Union figures are), and are initially hard to locate.       Edward S. Salomon of the 82nd Illinois, a Jewish Colonel who fought gallantly at Gettysburg and was promoted later to the brevet rank of General is not even mentioned as one of the top ranking Jewish officers on either side in the Civil War.      Overall, a solid work, but the inaccuracies are not that minor, especially regarding the great Cherokee Stand Watie, or Salomon, who later was appointed to a Governorship in the Northwest by President U.S. Grant as recognition of his services. Also, I'm not sure if John Pope would qualify as one of the worst Generals of the Civil War. He performed admirably at New Madrid, Island Number 10, and at Corinth, and he was poorly served by McClellan and his minions at Second Manassas. Judson Kilpatrick, the coward who recklessly sent Farnsworth to his death on the 3rd day of Gettysburg and who later rode to the gates of Richmond and was scared off by a few militia, would qualify many times more than General Pope would. For what it does contain, however, it is still an excellent reference tool for Civil War researchers.	2004-08-02

When &quot;The Civil War: Strange & Fascinating Facts&quot; or, &quot;Our Incredible Civil War&quot; was first published in 1960, America was on the eve of &quot;celebrating&quot; the 100 anniversary of that poignant, defining moment in our history. We were also on the verge of finally bringing those rights to Black Americans that rightfully should have been granted after Appomattox. <br />  <br /> Burke Davis' book was an instant bestseller then. And almost 45 years later still is. <br />  <br /> Mr. Davis covers the all of the major and minor incidents of the Civil War, from 1812 war veteran and Gettysburg civilian John Burns grabbing his musket and going to fight alongside the Union Iron Brigade at that decisive battle, to the tragedy of Confederate Isidore Guillen, who inherited the horse that his two brothers were killed riding on, only to be mortally wounded himself, to the humorous story of Jason the mule, who would go into the tent of a Confederate colonel late at night because that colonel resembled his owner! <br />  <br /> Davis also cites practically all of the amazing inventions of the Civil War, and he was the first historian to cite the story of the C.S.S. Hunley, the Rebel sub that was the first to sink an enemy vessel, but went down with all hands in Charleston Harbor.  <br />  <br /> There are also enthralling chapters on foreigners who served on both sides, on spies,on famous sea battles, including the one between the U.S.S. Kearsarge and the C.S.S Alabama in the French harbor of Cherbourg, thousands of miles away from North and South,and yes, there is even a chapter on sex in the Civil War too. <br />  <br /> This book is a treasure trove for Civil War enthusiasts (I have sent copies of it to my friends) - and the word &quot;trivia&quot; demeans its importance.

He has called for higher taxes, claiming he would only go after the wealthy. Sorry, Democratic politicans tax increases always seem to impact the middle class hardest. I live in California, and this is something that I know all too well. Of course John and Teresa Heinz would never feel that kind of economic pinch. <br />  <br /> Kerry also claims he will reduce our dependency on foreign oil. How, brown cow? If you are against drilling in Alaska or off the California coast, what is your alternative? In fact, every recent Democratic (as well as Republican President) Carter and Clinton have sucked up to the Saudis, Clinton's ambassador Wyche Fowler going so far as to place obstacles on anguished American parents of kidnapped Saudi children who tried to contact their children (see Pat Roush's excellent book). So what will John Kerry do that will be any different than what his friends didn't do? He doesn't say - nor provide us with his vision. <br />  <br /> Finally, Vietnam and his voting record on defense issues. John Kerry likes to wrap himself up in the flag and boast about those medals. Fine. But what he do when he came home? What about the campaign literature besmirching Ollie North? Ollie North helped bring freedom and democracy to Nicaragua - something that would never have happened if John Kerry and Jimmy Carter had their way. <br />  <br /> And finally, while Kerry claims he will push for a stronger military and a nation &quot;safe at home and respected aboard&quot;, the fact is, John Kerry's voting record has been anything but pro-military. On every crucial defense item, including our B-1 and Stealth Bombers, Kerry has voted against it. If Kerry had his way in the '80s, we'd still be in the middle of the Cold War. <br />  <br /> Deeds not words count. This book is merely words.

Grant (Modern Library War)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	THE BEST AND MOST POIGNANT MEMOIR BY A PRESIDENT	&quot;The Personal Memoirs&quot; of U.S. Grant are not only the very best memoirs ever penned by a former President, but they are also the most poignant. <br />  <br /> Imagine this. A man who was a failure at business and is even rejected by the pompous George McClellan when he practically begged for a regimental command becomes one of the greatest military commanders in United States History, perhaps even a more solid and accomplished leader than the Robert E. Lee whose &quot;Marble Man&quot; legend has eclipsed Grant (don't forget the unassuming Grant not only paved the way for a Union Victory in the West, but also bested the noble Lee from the Wilderness to Appomattox). He was elected President, but despite his own personal honesty and integrity, his administration was wracked by scandal.  <br />  <br /> After the Presidency, Grant settled down for what he and his family hoped would be a quiet, successful life. His involvement and investment with a crook, however, left the Grant family almost totally penniless - and at practically the same time he learned he had cancer of the throat. <br />  <br /> In a valiant race against time, Grant agreed to pen some articles for Century magazine. Mark Twain caught wind of this, and urged Grant to write a book of memoirs. In the one year of life remaining, and all too often in great pain, Grant didn't write one book - but a two-volume set of memoirs that are regarded not just a classic of war, but of U.S. History and Literature as well. He proved to be a winner once more, finally writing the last sentences of the memoirs less than 2 weeks before he died. <br />  <br /> These Memoirs flow with great descriptive writing of events, battles, and characters. While there are no really &quot;legendary&quot; moments that pop out at the reader, i.e., Lee and the wounded Union soldier at Gettysburg, for example, all of the moments written, of friends who came to prominence in the Mexican war, and some who,like his protege, General McPherson, later died, are gripping ones. His description of the love and respect he had for Abraham Lincoln is touching. As in the description of what took place at Appomattox Court House. <br />  <br /> A must set of books essential to all Americans who loved their country and respect their history. <br />  <br /> I was presented with the limited leatherbound first editon 2 volume set as a gift from my parents, something I will always treasure (I can only guess whom they might have belonged to) I can heartily recommend the Konecky and Konecky hardbound volume, or this modern library edition that I am reviewing here.

His story is told with clarity, with character, and wit. All of the joys and sorrows of his Presidency are captured here - from the highs that included rebuilding  a strong military and a strong economy, to the end of the Soviet empire, and the liberation of Grenada, to the sorrows of the dead Marines in Lebanon, the Challenger disaster, and the Iran-Contra scandal.  Ronald Reagan's story is a Presidential Autobiography that should be passed down from generation to generation as proof that character, optimism, grit and courage really matter. Unlike the &quot;legend in my own mind&quot; lengthy drivel recently written by one of his successors.<br />In short, Ronald Reagan told a good story here - and it was the truth, warts, or no blemishes at all. He was a Great American President - and a Mensch.	2004-06-28

No, not the kind of intelligence one gets as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, but in attending a small college in the Midwest. This President too, penned his memoirs, and they were full of hope, pride, and optimism - not for himself, but for the American people.<br />That President's name was Ronald Reagan, and his book was entitled: \\"AN AMERICAN LIFE\\" - and it truly was. Readable, Honest, Humorous, and Poignant. A Book all Americans should hand down to their children and grandchildren.<br />Another President has chosen to pen his memoirs. However, this lenghty tome is self-serving, poor-written, jumps back and forth, and while acknowledging character flaws that unfortunately are now part of the Historical record, this President still doesn't get it, and incredibly sees being Impeached (no, not for sexual harassment, but for lying under oath) as a \\"badge of honor\\".<br />This book is Bill Clinton's long anticipated, lengthy on narrative and egomania but short on substance and honesty memoir \\"My Life\\".<br />While Mr. Clinton does take pride in his accomplishments, and there were a few, he studiously avoids or ignores the people and the failures. For example, he writes chapter and verse about his opposition to the Draft, but contributes only 3 pages about Vince Foster's suicide. He blasts Gingrich and the Republicans for refusing to accept the nomination of Bill Lann Lee as Assistant Attorney General, insinuating that Mr. Lee was rejected because he was of a different color or race; the reality is that Mr. Lee was rejected because he defended radical thugs who had murdered innocent people. He blasts Ken Starr, a man recognized for his integrity by both Democrats and Republicans, and while paying lip-service to his own character flaws, still refuses to get it. (and ladies and gentlemen, character is king for anyone wishing to be President)<BR>The man responsible for Clinton's early success, Dick Morris, who crafted Clinton's image as a \\"moderate\\" or \\"centrist\\" Democrat is also given short-shrift here, and needless to say so are Paula Jones, Kathleen Wiley, and Linda Tripp. But we are fed a steady diet of Monica - and oh yeah, Hillary too.<br />Impeachment is NOT a \\"badge of honor\\". Remember, while he does recite chapter and verse about his friend Monica, we lost opportunities to put Bin Laden in our gunsights. <br />Mr. Clinton also bemoans Yasser Arafat's refusal to make peace even when the pliant \\"puppy\\" of the Clintonites, Ehud Barak, was prepared to retreat to the 1967 borders and give up half of Jerusalem to the PLO. Mr. Clinton and his policymakers invited Yasser Arafat to the White House 9 times - a man who has the blood of Americans on his hands, and only at the end when Arafat chooses the violence that was part and parcel of his nature does Clinton get angry with him. The failure of the Middle East Peace Talks in Clinton's memoirs reads like a soap opera - and a poorly scripted one at that.<br />Even when Clinton discusses events, such as the growing crisis in Bosnia, he tends to jump from events and personalities. Colin Powell's resignation is mentioned at the beginning of one chapter, yet then-General Powell can be found a few pages later, still Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in conference with Clinton, Christopher, Madeleine Albright and others. <br />Indeed, one doesn't have to dislike Clinton to dislike this book. It doesn't have the honesty, the intelligence, the day-to-day events that unfolded in the White House and the good writing that characterized President Reagan's memoir. <BR>This isn't Presidential Memoir calibre writing. It is choppy, inexcusable, and self-aggrandizing.<br /> I did read through Mr. Clinton's memoirs while waiting for a flight. and believe me, it wasn't worth the trouble. Barely worth this one star. Do yourselves a favor - pick up a copy of the Memoirs of Ronald Reagan instead.	2004-06-28

For example, he cites Colin Powell's retirement from the Army halfway through the book, but several pages later recites an episode concerning Bosnia where then General Powell was a participant.<br />Mr. Clinton also disparages or ignores those who opposed him. While one might dismiss a Paula Jones or a Kathleen Wiley, the fact remains that his behavior towards them helped paved the road to impeachment just as much as the affair with Monica Lewinsky did. Dick Morris is also convienently ignored, even though Mr. Morris helped craft and shape Clinton's image of being  a \\"moderate\\" or centrist democrat.<br />Oh yes, Bill seems to imply that prejudice towards non-whites was  the key factor in the rejection of Bill Lann Lee as Assistant Attorney General. Not the fact that Bill Lann Lee defended radical thugs who had murdered innocent people.<br />And get those buckets out. Bill practically sobs over Arafat's   rejection of peace in favor of murder and mayhem. The 9 White House visits and feasts bestowed on this terrorist couldn't even  push him to make peace. Nor Clinton and Carville's mechanics in undermining Bibi Netanyahu in favor of the more pliant and naive Ehud Barak who was willing to give up the Israeli store to make peace - a peace Arafat had no intention of making nor keeping.<br />Nowhere is mentioning, except in passing, the day-to-day goings-on and policymaking that past Presidential Memoirs have discussed. For all of the anti-intellectual commentary made about the memoirs of President Reagan or President Nixon, both books were far better written, and even controversal issues were  dealt with far morehonestly than the Clinton book. The memoirs of both Presidents Reagan and Nixon were readable, whereas Mr. Clinton's left much to be desired.<br />Reagan's book was warm, engaging, and honest, even when he discussed Iran-Contra. Clinton's - hmmm. He doesn't even discuss the secret deals he approved smuggling arms from Iran into Croatia to use against the Bosnian Serbs, or the hundreds of Al Qaeda operatives that subsequently entered Bosnia thanks to this policy, along with a score of retired U.S. military officers, who, with the Clinton administration's covert blessing went to advise the Croats and their Holocaust denier President Tudjman in his campaign to ethnically cleanse Knin Province of Serbs.<br />For a former President to write haughtingly and arrogantly about his impeachment (don't forget he did lie, folks, and character is all-important when you finger is near that proverbial button) and calling it a \\"badge of honor\\"...enough said. This book is barely worth the one star given.<br />The memoirs by Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, or U.S Grant's are far more honest, far more readable, and a much better gift to give someone than this \\"legend in my own mind\\"  ode to self-indulgence.	2004-06-27

McPherson and Stephen Sears.<br />Wert gives good, solid narrative to the desperate clash on Culp's Hill, and hails the little-known George Sears Greene, the oldest General in the Union Army on the battlefield, as the unsung hero of the battle, as  the failure of the Confederates to crack the right flank of the Union forces commanded by Greene at Culp's Hill (Gettysburg) seriously impacted Pickett's charge later that day.<br />The poignant aspects of the Culps Hill fight - the death of a scruffy little dog that charged with the Maryland Confederates against Maryland Unionist, and received a \\"Christian burial\\" from the heartbroken Union General who found him on the battlefield; the death of Wesley Culp, who was born nearby, went south to Virginia and joined the Rebels and died on his own property, and the horrible, suicidal charge of Charles Mudge's 2nd Massachusetts are  part and parcel of Wert's narrative.<br />As a Cavalry enthusiast, I certainly have no complaints only complements for Wert's descriptive of the East Cavalry Battle, or the subsequent attempts by Merritt and Kilpatrick to get behind the battered Confederates by the Round Tops just after Pickett's charge. The reader will get a true feel of the ferocity and desperation of the Stuart-Custer fight, and of Kilpatrick's senseless order to Farnsworth to lead a mounted charge across the rocky and tree-filled landscape just south of the Round Tops. <BR>Wert, to his credit, also writes of the little-known cavalry battle at Fairfield on the 3rd day between Merritt's Sixth U.S. Cavalry and Confederates led by \\"Grumble\\" Jones, a useless fight that resulted in a severe Union defeat (one of the captured Union cavalrymen was a Major George Cram, who was later commended by the Union Cavalry Chief Alfred Pleasanton in a document in this writer's possession).<br />By contrast, even the brilliant Gary Gallagher's series of essays in \\"The Third Day at Gettysburg and Beyond\\" doesn't even mention the cavalry fights!<br />Yes, the book is printed on rag paper, and yes, some of the maps described the wrong battles. For example the map depicting the fight on the South field (Round Tops)is actually the East Cavalry battle between Stuart and Custer, and vice versa. And yes, those were reasons why I gave this work a four-star review rather than the five-star which, with modifications and improvements it really deserves.<br />A good solid work on Gettysburg at an even better price!	2003-06-12

Bodansky provides all of the grim evidence needed to convict. <br />A must-read as our forces approach Baghdad and more intelligence revelations will be made very soon.	2003-03-26

Ropes has written a classic history of the Union Army of   under the brief leadership of John Pope which ended with Pope's defeat at the hands of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson at Second Manassas in August 1862. This slim book was part of a &quot;Campaigns of the Civil War&quot; series originally published in the 1880s, and the current edition is a verbatim of the original.<br />While much has been said about Pope's bombastic &quot;Headquarters in the Saddle&quot; speech that offended many of the rank and file, and of his &quot;scorched earth&quot; policies that prompted  Robert E. Lee to label Pope a &quot;miscreant&quot;, recent histories suggest that it was the  selfishness of George McClellan and the uncooperative attitudes of  McClellan's lieutenants who served under Pope, specifically Fitz-John Porter, that were primarily to blame for Pope's resounding defeat.<br />This contemporary account of the actions of Pope's army pretty much affirms the recent accounts, commenting on how Pope was able to consolidate the scattered and badly beaten (by Jackson) elements of the Union forces in the Shenandoah into one cohesive force. Pope also established a pretty credible Union cavalry force that unfortunately was not supported by the Union infantry. This actually led to Pope's undoing when John Buford and a small cavalry force found itself alone up against Longstreet's entire corps in the Thoroughfare Gap. Forced to concede the Gap, the Union cavalry alerted Pope to the fact that Longstreet was coming in to relieve Jackson, who was pretty badly battered. Pope refused to heed this warning until it was too late, and was soundly thrashed. <br />The reluctance of Fitz-John Porter to commit his corps to the fray, and of his mentor McClellan refusal to send troops already promised to Pope only contributed to an inevitable, though not necessary defeat.<br />If only Ropes' book, with its small print wasn't so difficult to read!<br /> Even the wonderfully graphic maps are barely legible. I would recommend &quot;Second Manassas&quot; from the Time-Life Voices of the Civil War series, and &quot;Return to Bull Run&quot; by John Hennessey for further exploration of the Pope period in the Union Army.	2002-10-19

You've apparently never read James McPherson before, and<br />2.) Even Professor McPherson stated in the introduction that this was NOT a full battle history of Antietam.<br /> With the notable exceptions of \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" and \\"Lamson of the Gettysburg\\" Dr. McPherson writes tight, moving, beautifully written book-length essays. \\"Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam\\" is no different. He captures the mood of the country, the defeat of Pope at Second Manassas, and Lee's decision to go north, the battle itself, and President Lincoln's decision to go forth with the Emancipation Proclamation as a result of the Union  victory.<br /> The passages describing the drama at Harpers Ferry when Stonewall Jackson hemmed in the hapless drunk Dixon Miles, and the vacillation of Union commanders, are among the best written on thst prelude to the Antietam battle, and while Professor McPherson may not write a lengthy battle history, he does capture of the drama and pathos of the battle exceptionally well. <br />And as he pointed out, this book was not just a battle narrative, and he recommended that the reader interested in such do read other works including John Priest's \\"Antietam: The Soldier's Battle\\".<br />\\"Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam\\" is just as solid and just as good as some of his earlier works including \\"For Cause and Comrades\\", \\"What They Fought For\\", \\"Images of the Civil War\\" (with Mort Kunstler), as well as \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\".<br />If I am effusive in my praise for this book, it is only because it is Right, and I am also indebted to Dr. McPherson's encouragement and kindness to me when our book \\"Civil War: Garments, History, Legends and Lore\\" was published. Dr. McPherson, thank you, and once again you have come through with a winner!	2002-09-08

And the not-so-well known - men such as William Rufus Shafter, the corpulent former Union officer and presumed model for \\"Pecos Bill\\", who was named commander of the expeditionary forces in Cuba and who often clashed with both his superiors in Washington, and with one certain volunteer colonel by the name of Theodore Roosevelt.<br />To be fair, I haven't gotten to the military operations nor the logistical problems experienced by the U.S. Army - poisoned (embalmed) beef, lack of smokeless cartridges (the antiqudated Spanish Army was  more \\"modern\\" in this respect), as Musicant's account is an excellent read.

Keith Thompson, and James Madole eagerly sought ideological alliances with the Soviet Union against their own country!*<br />Fact: Yasser Arafat had a cordial ideological relationship with Otto Remer, the betrayer of the brave Anti-Nazi Germans of the July 20, 1944 plot to kill Adolf.<br />Lee exposes the machinations of the bizarre Francis Yockey, a Fascist ideologue who once worked for US prosecutors trying Nazi criminals but was fired when he was exposed, and later committed suicide in mysterious circumstances in a San Francisco jail. He also exposes the shadowy H. Keith Thompson, who by his own bouyant admission worked for German Intelligence during World War II, and admitted to acts of sabotage against the U.S. Yet this wealthy native-born traitor, who openly admits to hating the country of his birth, was NEVER arrested by the FBI - not once, despite a lifelong career of sucking to hate groups.<BR>This is one major unanswered question given the recent and not-so-recent failures of the FBI. Who was protecting this scumbag who applauded the deaths of Americans who fought Hitlerism???<br />Lee never addresses the reasons why Keith Thompson was never arrested and prosecuted by our authorities, whereas the sicko Yockey was. This is one major flaw in this book.<br />His tantalizing glimpses sometimes lack the detail needed for a work of this calibre. As a Republican, I also find fault with his readiness to accuse the GOP of cuddlying up to the wackos despite the Democratic Party's habit of welcoming with open arms former, unrepentent Communists and \\"Liberation\\" movement supporters. Thus the 4 stars instead of the five that it deserves.<br />A scary, necessary book for all Americans who hate extremism of all kinds.

Here we find that Robert Lincoln clearly was not too thrilled about his father becoming the Republican Presidential nominee in 1860, how Abraham Lincoln clearly fussed and agonized over son's Tad's missing (but eventually found) goat, all the more poignant because of Willie's death, and the tragic fire that claimed Willie's pony (not mentioned in this book). Or how Lincoln seemingly dispassionately mentioned in his correspondence to his wife the loss of Mary Todd Lincoln's Brother-In-Law, the Confederate General Ben Hardin Helm at the battle of Chickamauga.<br />Donald has given us a beautifully presented and written book, a worthy gift to the Lincoln and Civil War reader - the only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five was that it is too pricey for a non fleshed-out biography, but would definitely be worth the fifth star at a bargain-based price.	2001-12-31

His &quot;Tale Tales of the Civil War&quot; and &quot;2,000 Questions and Answers About the Civil War&quot; are books that I have consulted in my own Civil War research, and occupy an honored place on my bookshelves.<br />But &quot;Civil War: Schemes and Plots&quot; unfortunately does fall short of Garrison's usually master touch.<br />Yes, Garrison does highlight the famous Kilpatrick-Dahlgren Raid of March 1864, the attempt by Union Cavalry to free their comrades languishing in Richmond's Libby Prison - and which is now considered by many to have been a plot to kill Jefferson Davis and his Cabinet.<br />Yes, Garrison also covers the bungled attempt by the ironically-named Confederate Agent Robert C. Kennedy to burn down New York in November 1864, an act that eventually sent Kennedy to the gallows.<br />But where does he get off in calling Jeb Stuart's &quot;Ride around McClellan&quot; a scheme. It was a masterful Cavalry raid. But a scheme?<br />Or the seizure of Confederate emissaries John Slidell and James Mason from the British steamer Trent by the daring Union Naval officer Charles Wilkes. A Scheme??? A Plot???<br />And I'm not sure how Winfield Scott's &quot;Anaconda Plan&quot; to strangle the South was a scheme or a plot as well. Grand strategy, Yes. Plot, I don't think so.<br />While Garrison does correctly label the pro-Confederate &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; as being active plotters against the Union in the Mid-Western states, he ignores the notorious activity of Confederate agents in plotting and igniting the infamous New York Draft Riots of July 1863 - riots that nearly brought the &quot;Big Apple&quot; down to its knees and which were only put down by the arrival of Union Infantry straight from the Gettysburg battlefield.<br />A worthy, though not major addition to the established collection of Webb Garrison's fine trivial-based works on our Civil War.	2001-12-31
US	52532871	R2HWK7TEK89G3G	0060187239	630454514	April 1865: The Month That Saved America	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Engrossing, Moving, Graphic - Can't put "April 1865" down	I rarely like or do pay the humongous price when a book is first published, but based on the glowing reviews of \\"April 1865\\" written by James McPherson, among others, and on solid excerpts published in both \\"American Spectator\\" and in \\"Parade\\" magazine, I was sold - and definitely NOT disappointed.<br />One might never have expected Jay Winik to the tackle that crucial last month of the Civil War. After all, Winik is the author of an excellent work on the Neo-Conservative Policymakers of the Reagan era. But he has definitely risen to the occasion with this worthy and thoughtful work.<br />Winik accurately captures the tormented soul of Abraham Lincoln, who might have conceded earlier in the war after disastrous defeats at Second Bull Run and Fredericksburg, and even as late as the autumn of 1864 the issue was still in doubt. Yet the majesty and the perseverence of Lincoln comes through, as well as his nobility and frailities. Lincoln, as Winik comments, lost 30 pounds by war's end, was prone to constant headaches, was haunted by the possibility of the South resorting to guerrilla warfare, yet he pressed on in his determination to reunite America and end Slavery.<br />The crucial role of Robert E. Lee is also examined in depth. Lee, urged by his artillery commander, Edward Alexander to go \\"bush\\" (pardon the pun) and resort to guerrilla warfare, something enthusiastically seconded by Jefferson Davis, chose instead to surrender and spare the south - and the nation as a whole the horror of partisan warfare and terrorism.<br />And that spectre was not too far off in the shadows. In discussing Lee's dilemma, Winik conveys the horror and heartbreak of Missouri - torn apart by murderous guerrilla warfare in which Rebel partisans wore civilian clothes or often donned blue when setting upon Union-held communities...or Unionist wore grey in their grim retribution....<br />Even closer to the main theatre of war in Virginia, this savagery was all too apparent only three days before Appomattox, when Union forces caught up with Lee's desperate, starved divisions at Sayler's Creek. During the initial flush of battle, the combatants resorted to knives, to fists, even biting and grabbing at their opponents - or even their own....<br />The devastation of the south and its institutions, the human toll, is captured graphically in a chapter entitled \\"Surrender\\" in which the author makes the comparison of what the North would have suffered under similiar conditions - New York, Philadelphia and Washington destroyed; Libraries burned, \\"West Point ransacked and torched\\"; \\"Manhattan - a national Confederate graveyard\\": - Theodore Roosevelt, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Andrew Carnegie all dead or maimed.<br />The country was spared this - but just barely - and even after Appomattox, the generous peace of Grant and Lincoln nearly unravelled with the murder of the latter five days after Lee's surrender. It was the military leaders, not the politicians, who behaved like statesmen and came forward, grimly clearsighted in knowing what the alternative would be.<br />Where else can one note that Judan P. Benjamin, the Confederate Secretary of State and a noted Slaver - actually endorsed the full emancipation of the South's Slave population, or that the South itself was much more willing to emancipate at war's end than what the Historical record indicates.<br />This is a gripping, narrative which enhances previous works such as Noah Andre Trudeau's \\"Out of the Storm\\" and Hoehling's \\"After The Guns Fell Silent\\".<br />My only disappointment - and it is a significant one, is that in capturing the desire of the Southerners to fight on, Winik barely glosses over the reaction of Northerners to the events, especially Lincoln's assassination. To get this view, one must turn to Catton, Sandburg, or William C. Davis' \\"Lincoln's Men\\" - where the final chapter mentions the murders of Confederate POWs who unwisely applauded the assassination. The North too, was fully prepared to fight on - and the outcome would have torn the country apart.<br />A must for anyone's Civil War library - especially with its dramatic images of Sayler's Creek, Appomattox, and the death of Lincoln and always in the background - the dreaded \\"What If\\" - and why it wasn't.	2001-05-10

Rosecrans who deserves much of the credit for the Union victory. Rosecrans was aggressive, and he didn't hesitate whereas his boss did. Indeed, Rosecrans own career skyrocketed after his success in West Virginia, only to nose dive so quickly two years later at Chickamauga.<br />McClellan also had the services of General Jacob Cox of Ohio, who would later distinguish himself in Sherman's Atlanta Campaign, and of the famed explorer Frederic West Lander, who at one time rivalled Fremont in his Westward explorations, but who died so suddenly after the West Virginia campaign.<br />Also involved was a then little-known NCO named Ambrose Bierce, whose own macabre writings, including &quot;A Horse-Man in the Sky&quot; and &quot;The Mocking Bird&quot; came directly out of his experiences serving in an Indiana regiment during the fighting in West Virginia. If you like the twist and turns of Bierce's fiction, then this non-fiction work is a must.<br />Also going for McClellan was the key factor of a mountain populace that was on his side.<br />In contrast Lee suffered from poor generals - one of them, John B. Floyd, bicked constantly with his fellow generals. Floyd, the treasonous Secretary of War in the pre-Lincoln Buchanan Administration, was in constant fear of being captured and hanged. One of the more gifted Generals, Robert Garnett, was killed early on in the retreat from Rich Mountain. Garnett's cousin, Richard, would die in Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg almost two years later.<br />Lee's troops suffered from poor morale - a fact not lost on the future Confederate commander, who learned from his lessons here, whereas McClellan quickly forgot his.<br />Of additional note is the fact that two future Presidents - Rutherford Hayes and William McKinley, served in the 24th Ohio during the West Virginia battles, while the Grandfather of George S. Patton fought with the Confederate forces.<br />Not only does Newell cover fresh ground, but the illustrations, particularly those at the beginning of each chapter, give the reader a &quot;you are there&quot; feel.	2001-04-18

From the start, the &quot;purists&quot; (what an inaccurate term for these cretins!) like Ralph Emery pooh-poohed the genre, and even to this day dedicated Country and Country Rock artists such as Haggard, Owens, Hillman, and even Dwight Yoakum aren't totally accepted in Nashville. On the other hand, the &quot;with-it&quot; underground rock stations looked with askance on what the Byrds, Burritos, and Poco were trying to accomplish. It was only the Eagles, who freely borrowed from Gram Parsons, Chris Hillman and Richie Furay, who achieved real success, and only after they became an atypical stadium rock band - leaving their country roots in the dust.<br />Parts of the narrative do leave the reader dangling in mid-air, especially when the author skips from one band to another without a clear, concise summarization - i.e., how long did the Corvettes back Linda Ronstadt, and who actually succeeded them, Swampwater or the future Eagles, for example? Or the time future Burrito John Beland backed two guys named Glenn Frey and J.D. Souther at the Troubadour club. And where is Steve Gillette? Or the influence of one Bob Stane, whose famed Ice House once energized the careers of White, the Dillards, the Dirt Band, and Jackson Browne, among others?<br />But to Einarson's lasting credit, he hasnot only filled an important cultural gap in his storytelling of the history of California Country, but those in the know will find the true and honest voices of ex-Byrds Hillman and John York, among others. He also gives a voice to those like Hearts and Flowers Larry Murray, whose own valued contributions have regrettably stayed in the shadows to this day.<br />Thanks to the pioneers of Country-Rock, the Byrds taking flight with &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;, and the Burritos taking it further along with &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; - Country Rock, a California original, has remained so influencial to this day - which is more than can be said of the dribble of one Ralph Emery. &quot;Desperados&quot; is a worthy and very important chronicle of that fabled time when as Gib Guilbeau put it, &quot;when the steel cried and the 12-string jangled...&quot;	2001-03-03

The account was written was a fellow member of the British Battalion, and although presumably a Communist, the passage spoke of Wales, family and the Spanish earth in which the boy died.<br />The family accounts telling of RAF fliers who never returned from their bombing missions over Germany, or the haunted German tank officer in a Berlin shelter at the onslaught of the Russian advance telling his fellow Germans to fight to the death because of the depravations done by the Wehrmacht and SS in France,Russia and elsewhere.<br />Then there is the horrifying and heartrending account of a Jewish rickshaw driver in the Warsaw Ghetto being tortured to death by a sadistic SS officer for crossing his path.<br />These passages provide a worthy though not always matching narrative to the photographs.<br />Yes, there are complaints about the photographs. But remember, colour photography was about as new in the Second World War as black and white photography was in the American Civil War. It wasn't always possible to match a colour photograph with an event,especially in the case of the Holocaust, or when a battle was in full rage.<br />And the photograph of an atomic bomb explosion over a Japanese city was in reality the explosion of an H-Bomb over a pacific island in the 1950s.<br />The book is very much worth the purchase to experience to newness of colour photography combined with readable reference of what the common man or women experienced during World War II. At least it kept my interest in that almost 12 hour flight home.	2001-02-02
US	52532871	R2WWZ0ICVU1YIK	0517162113	723991642	Civil War A to Z	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Not Comprehensive But Good Civil War Introduction	&quot;Civil War A-Z&quot; is not, nor does it pretend to be a comprehensive history of the Civil War. There are approximately 200 entries in little more than 100 pages of text. So we're talking a pretty slim volume here.<br />But as Author Kalman points out to her credit, &quot;...Civil War A-Z provides a point of reference for the general reader. It describes  the important, and sometimes unusual people, ideas and events of the war&quot;...<br />And it works.<br />While the major personalities and battles are reiterated in brief passages perhaps frustrating to the not-so-novice reader, Kalman also mentions those who weren't so well-known, including the Confederate General Felix Zollicoffer, a one-time Whig Congressman and colleague of Abraham Lincoln, who decided to wear a white raincoat while riding into Union lines during the Battle of Mill Springs. For this folly Zollicoffer paid with his life, when a Union soldier, ironically another friend of Lincoln's, shot him dead in the saddle!<br />&quot;Civil War A-Z&quot; also sheds light on the secret organizations that supported the North and South. Ever hear of the &quot;Heroes of America&quot;?  They were southerners living in Tennessee, Arkansas and elsewhere who actively opposed the war and did what they could to discourage Southern men from enlisting in the Confederate Armies. Or &quot;The Knights of the Golden Circle&quot;?  They were Northerners for the most part, aided and abetted by Confederate Agents who tried to bring down the Union War effort.<br />Ever hear of Edmund Raffin? Or Stand Watie? Or the Hampton Roads Conference or General Order Number 11? They are among some of the other topics that can be found here. The role of minority groups are represented, albeit frustratingly brief, as are technological advances which came to light during the Civil War. Even Thaddeus Sobieski Coulincourt Lowe is mentioned here for his development of airship reconnaisance for the Union Armies, but his role in the development of Cal Tech is sadly neglected.<br />All in all, &quot;Civil War A-Z&quot; is a good beginner's manual to the Civil War, and compliments the Civil War Society's equally slim volumes &quot;Civil War Generals&quot; and &quot;Civil War Battles&quot; or those excellent trivial volumes written by Webb Garrison. But only a beginning. Kalman's book is a good vehicle for the young, or Civil War novice reader -  but not substantial. <br />To those readers interesting in increasing your knowledge of the Civil War, this writer heartily recommends going on to &quot;The New American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War&quot;, U.S. Grant's &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Burke Davis' &quot;The Civil War: Strange and Fascinating Facts&quot;, and those fine volumes of Sandburg's biography of Abraham Lincoln, to name just some of the myriad of Civil War works available.	2001-01-08

I have just finished reading &quot;A Passion For Truth: The Selected Writings of Eric Breindel&quot; and have been truly stunned by the power and truth of this young man's writings. And I cannot keep his book down - nor one of the final pieces that he wrote (not in this slim volume) - a scathing criticism of State Department official Aaron Miller for shoving Yasser Arafat down the throat of the United States Holocaust Museum.<br />Breindel died two years ago, 42 and way too young.<br />In many ways he might have been a contemporary of mine - his worldview of the former Soviet Union and of those stupid Americans who spied for &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; based upon his impeccable research was the same as mine; his unbridled contempt of Racists whatever their skin color mirrored my own feelings; as well as his blunt perspectives on the refusal of the Democratic Party to ferret out Left Fascists.<br />And while I might not be a son of Holocaust survivors as the author was, I too share the views on Israel and on Nazi collaborators and terrorists expressed by the author in the chapter entitled: &quot;Fate of the Jews&quot;.<br />This small book which only scratched the surface of Breindel's powerful writings, is one that should be a part of every thoughtful American's home library whatever your race, religion, or creed might be. For Eric Breindel was a decent, true patriotic Jewish American whose writings reflected his deep love of Country and Religion, and who sadly passed on much too early.	2000-09-24

Lee and Stonewall Jackson, meticulously chronicled  the Civil War career of Jeb Stuart. <br />The book begins with a stirring  accout of John Brown's raid at Harper's Ferry prior to the war, and  Stuart's critical role in his eventual capture. The narrative grabs the  reader's attention, and never lets go - even into the maelstrom of battle  and Cavalry engagements. Stuart riding circles around McClellan during the  Seven Day's Battles, his role in being Lee's eyes at Antietam and  Fredericksburg, and his taking command of Stonewall Jackson's Corps when  that great Confederate leader was mortally wounded at  Chancellorsville.<br />Then it all goes downhill from there.  No,not the book,  which does keep the reader enthralled to the grim end, but for Stuart and  the Confederate Cavalry. Mistakes are made at Brandy Station, and shortly  afterwards at Gettysburg, where Stuart encounters a Union Cavalry General  just as flamboyant as he - George Armstrong Custer. <br />Other Union  Cavalrymen make their mark - Pleasanton, Buford, and finally Sheridan - as  the worn and tattered Confederate Cavalry decline towards the bitter end  and Stuart rides to meet Sheridan and Custer at a little hamlet called  Yellow Tavern.<br />Davis' narrative makes the reader feel as if he or she is  indeed riding with Stuart - the smell of leather, of gunpowder and the  sweat of the horses. The Rebel Yell and the fast gallop.Stuart's family is  also given fine coverage, his devoted wife Flora, his hapless  father-in-law, General Cooke, who remained loyal to the Union, and who was  soundly thrashed by his ownson-in-law! and his entourage, including the  amazing Heros Von Boercke and banjo man Sam &quot;Jine The Cavalry&quot;  Sweeney.

Williams was a real person, a member of several New York volunteer regiments that were part of the Union Army during the Civil War. Williams himself was both a soldier and a volunteer, and his &quot;Bullet and Shell&quot; written nearly twenty years after the end of the war is his  account of the actions of the Union Army of the Potomac.<br />Be aware that  this is a work of fiction based on true events and true people - including  U.S. Grant, Generals Meade, Warren, Kilpatrick, Sedgwick, Custer and  others. Williams apparently did not wish to go to a strictly  autobiographical account as was the custom in those days. Here he  skillfully chose two young protagonists - Frank, based on himself, (as was  Osborn, the war correspondent) and Tom, a Virginian, who while pre-war  friends argued over secession and slave rights - and then when war broke  out found themselves on opposite sides.<br />The carnage of battle is vividly  described here - at Seven Days, Chancelorsville, Gettysburg and the  Wilderness, as well as the final drama of Appomattox. Here Frank describes  as close friends are killed nearby, the tedium of camp life,foraging for  food in a destitute country, the adventures of scouts behind enemy lines,  and the true events of the war as they built to a climax.<br /> In one  dramatic scene &quot;Frank&quot; (Williams)  temporarily captures his  former friend Tom at Gettysburg, then let him go - their friendship  apparently still intact.<br />He also describes the characteristics of the  Generals to a tee - Warren, nervous and irritable; Grant - &quot;steady  calm and confident&quot; and Meade, &quot;courtly&quot;.<br />Again, this is  fiction based on fact, whereas it is presented as being strictly factual.  This being the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars as it is indeed a  classic work of the War Between The States.<br />And yes, the wonderful  illustrations of Edwin Forbs are a plus!	2000-04-03

I remember reading &quot;Gray Fox&quot; many years ago, and for some reason it didn't leave a major impact on me then... Then I recently bought the &quot;new&quot; version, and found it extremely gripping, and more  importantly - quite readable.<br />The first chapter sets the tone of the book  - it tells of the inner crisis that Lee faced with Secession, the attack on  Fort Sumter, and his decision to reject President Lincoln's offer of a  command of the Union Army.One can sense the full drama of the moment, as  Lee turns his back on his love of country and army in favor of his state,  about to join the Southern Confederacy.<br />Above all, Burke Davis is a  master storyteller - and his Civil War Histories, though basically written  from a Southern perspective (he has also written biographies of  &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson and Jeb Stuart, as well as the wonderful  &quot;The Civil War: Strange and Fascinating Facts&quot;)are on a par with  those written by Catton, Foote, and McPherson.By emphasizing both the  history and the human interest aspects of Lee, Davis makes the reader feels  a part of the story; as if he were at Lee's side at Antietam, Gettysburg,  Appomattox...<br />For those interested in learning both the realities as well  as the legend of Lee, I would strongly suggest purchasing this book, as  well as Alan Nolan's controversal &quot;Lee Reconsidered&quot; (which  presents a more sobering view of Lee the man) as vantage points to begin  reading about the man considered by many to be America's &quot;finest  General&quot; - though I'm not so sure about that opinion myself.	2000-02-22

Davis,  the volatile Union General, Thomas Custer, George Armstrong's Medal of  Honor winning brother, and Confederate Sergeant Richard Kirkland, the  so-called &quot;Angel&quot; of Fredericksburg, whose compassion towards  wounded Union soldiers on the Fredericksburg battlefield is now part of the  Civil War legend (less than a year later, Kirkland, by then an officer,  died gallantly on the Chickamauga Battlefield). Brothers who fought on  opposite sides, such as Percival (who was Farragut's flag captain at Mobile  Bay) and Thomas Drayton and James and William Terrill (&quot;...perhaps  their education either reflected - or influenced - their decisions&quot;).  In the latter case, both Terrills died on the battlefield, Union General  William at Perryville, and Confederate General James at Bethesda  Church.<br />Davis also brings to life Women, Blacks, and Native Americans  such as the Confederate Cherokee Stand Watie who served in the Civil War.  For those already familiar with Davis' earlier works, he also brings to  this volume his antipathy (less than well-concealed) towards Confederate  General Joseph Johnston (&quot;Afterwards Johnston fought Davis with a  vigor he never showed against the Yankees&quot;).<br />Outside of this  opinionated analysis, and the exclusion of other colorful figures such as  Medal of Honor Winner Union Nurse Mary Walker and Confederate General  Joseph Wheeler (in a 128 page book you can't have everybody), this book of  fine portraits and well-written profiles clearly belongs on the bookshelves  of both the beginning student and the diehard enthusiast, and makes a fine  holiday (or otherwise) gift for those in both categories!eler (in a 128 page book you can't have everybody), this book of  fine portraits and well-written profiles clearly belongs on the bookshelves  of both the beginning student and the diehard enthusiast, and makes a fine  holiday (or otherwise) gift for those in both categories!	1999-11-22

An early volunteer in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion fighting  Fascism in Spain, Herrick was badly wounded in the first major battle  fought by the Lincolns at Jarama. Transferred to a hospital, Herrick  witnessed firsthand the betrayals and backstabbing policies of the Soviet  Secret Police and their minions. In one horrific episode, Herrick recounts how, as an \\"unreliable\\" he was forced to be involved in an GPU\International Brigade execution of accused \\"Trotskyist\\" civilians, an event that has haunted him to this day.    Returning home, Herrick then suffered the  emotional wound of the Hitler-Stalin Pact, and being Jewish, promptly broke  with the Party - courageously demonstrating as \\"a veteran of the  Spanish Civil War - victim of the Hitler-Stalin Pact. He went on to  adventures serving as a majordomo of sorts for Orson Welles - and some of  the tales told here about \\"Citizen Kane\\" are quite hilarious.  Herrick once told Life Magazine that his reasons for going to fight  Hitlerism in Spain were that \\"As A Jew I know what Hitler is doing to  my people\\".While he later admitted that it was the Party who  instructed this to say the aforementioned remark, his pride and emotional  attachment to his people clearly stands out in \\"Jumping The Line\\"  as well as his \\"no prisoners taken\\" attitude towards both Fascism  and Communism. This is indeed a memoir that Jews and all interested in the  Spanish Civil War worldwide should read and while Herrick is a man who will  admit his faults with candor, he is nonetheless a brave man and excellent  writer - \\"Hermanos\\" is also strongly recommended by this  reviewer.	1999-02-21

This first volume, which actually covers the conflict from secession to the climax at Gettysburg contains  some of the best photograpy culled from the files of Matthew Brady,  Alexander Gardner, and others. While the photographs alone would be worth  the price, it is the accompanying text, written in the main by William C.  Davis  (with James M. McPherson and Shelby Foote arguably our finest Civil  War historians) and Bell Wiley which captures the reader by tieing together  the imagery with the fact. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the  pre-war photographs of a timid-looking James Buchanan or the lean, mean  look of the fireeating James Lane of Kansas are no exceptions. Or the dead  Confederates laying near &quot;Burnside's Bridge&quot; following Antietam,  or the bouyant beau sabeur Wade Hampton on one page and a youthful George  Custer with his dog Rose on the next in the segment describing the cavalry  fight at Gettysburg.<br />This compact work is thick, it is true, but a lot  easier to carry along than the oversized volume. The only drawback to this  and the companion volume is the small print of the text and captions.

Wideman's narrative is balanced, and he has indeed chosen the best  illustrations from the past as well as from today's Civil War artists, as  he himself pointed out in his comments.  Wideman not only covers and covers  well the major actions (&quot;Monitor&quot; vs. &quot;Merrimac&quot;,  Farragut at Mobile Bay, the &quot;Kearsage&quot; vs. &quot;Alabama&quot;),  he also covers the lesser-known incidents as well; i.e., the Red River  Expedition of 1864, and the assault on Fort Fisher in 1865. All of the  major naval personalities are also mentioned here, although he only gives  scent coverage to Cushing's daring assault on C.S.S. Albemarle. Again, very  value-priced and a finely illustrated narrative of civil war sea combat and  innovation.	1998-10-31
