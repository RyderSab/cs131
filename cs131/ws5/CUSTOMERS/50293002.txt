What I'm doing now is reading a Book by Butler, then I compare it with a Book by Pope. I used to dislike prose translations, but I'm getting so much out of Butler's that I've changed my tune. Anent nothing, I'm not such a big fan of Fagles.	2004-03-08

(Now and then I realize how esoteric my books about Joyce and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; are.) Anyway, Marshall McLuhan's kid Eric dove headlong into the Frey oops fray and came up with a winner. &quot;FW&quot; takes place on a Thursday, as does &quot;Ulysses.&quot; And Feb. 2, 1882, was a Thor's Day too. Oh my gosh...how does one write a review of this book. I guess it's for Joyce fans, or those who have read &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; more than once. To me, reading &quot;about&quot; the Wake is as fun as reading the Wake. &quot;Oh; THAT'S what that means!!&quot; Let's face it, we all need a lot of help. If you've seen the paperback &quot;War and Peace in the Global Village&quot;---where, I think, the page called &quot;What the thunders said...&quot; is found---you'll have a headstart. Enough! or too much. Thanks, Eric McLuhan.	2003-12-31

One may read it for his style alone. Large book, many small chapters. Book II is something of the life of the 17th Earl of Oxford, but Book I is my favorite--I love Ogburn's quoting of the Orthodox scholars of Shaxberd (or Shagspere, or Shakesper, or Shakspre, or Shaxper, or Shaxpere, or Shexpere): did you know that the &quot;university of life&quot; is &quot;more exacting&quot; than the education you'd get at Cambridge? No? Important Stratfordian scholars would have you think so. They also say there is little &quot;book learning&quot; in the plays attributed to William Shakespeare. Then Ogburn lists all of the learning and various subjects Oxford was more or less an expert on...or had firsthand experience with (like travel, the law, falconry, botany, science, music, art, classical literature and philosophy, jousting, the military, etc.). The orthodox scholars now think that &quot;Shakespeare&quot; must have seen Italy in order to write about it as one who was there.<br />Indeed.	2003-06-05

A play-by-play exegesis of unexplainable passages; it's as if the Earl himself is explaining &quot;what he meant.&quot;<br />I bought this book from the publisher, via the Shakespeare-Oxford Society.

I like the added lines in &quot;Lear&quot; within square brackets. (The Oxford edition printed the play twice, in its two versions. Bevington's way is better.) I like the front matter, and each play's introduction. I like the footnoted scene divisions.

I wish Wills would write (say that 5X fast) separate books on (a) Wayne's popularity; (b) his life; (c) his movies; and (d) John Ford, Howard Hawks, Harry Carey, Yak Canutt, et al., etc. John Wayne has a supporting role in  this book. It's good reading, don't get me wrong, but Wills doesn't nail  his thesis on the head. He's more comfortable writing about John Ford's  personality than the nature of celebrity in America. So really, we don't  need to be told the obvious: John Wayne is still popular because he was so  stinkin' good at what he did. Period. To Wills: I like Wagner's music, but  I probably wouldn't like Wagner himself. So what. Wayne was a movie actor  and did his job well; I enjoy his movies. Full stop. I'd recommend reading  this book, though, until the definitive study of Wayne's films comes along.	2000-06-06

I'm sugar-free ever since reading &quot;Sugar Blues.&quot; I was sluggish, moody, hungry, etc. I remembered that John Lennon mentioned Dufty's book in an interview once. So I bought it at the local health food store. He starts  off with his own sugar hell and redemption and then delves into the whole  history of the cane. Very interesting, healthwise and also politically.  This is the meat of the book. (The Boston &quot;Tea&quot; Party? More like  the rum party.) I like his writing style; he keeps it homespun. (Why did  some think this book needs more &quot;hard science&quot;? Isn't it already  in there? It's not intended to be in a medical journal [which can't always  be trusted!].) When I tell people I'm sugar-free they usually scoff, saying  sugar's not that bad for you, why give it up completely. Well, now I wake  up clear and I get through the afternoon w/o any flagging of energy. At  various times of the day I'll feel some energy racing through my body. (A  great feeling; keeps me motivated.) Now I need less food on my plate, and  my hypoglycemia has all but disappeared. (Think about THAT one, folks.)  Never eat &quot;refined sucrose&quot; again!

That would be &quot;'Ulysses' Annotated.&quot; But, Ellmann's views on Joyce's masterpiece are extremely  valuable to those who've read Joyce, and more than once. Like Lang in his  &quot;Music of Western Civilization,&quot; Ellmann says much in little  space. I'd say a top 10 book on &quot;Ulysses,&quot; all told.	2000-01-25

Full stop.	\\"Finnegans Wake\\" (no apostrophe, kids) is the logical conclusion (\\"It's Phoenix, dear!\\") to Joyce's creative life, the last work of the greatest master of words in any language since Shakespeare. (Admit  it!) If you think \\"Ulysses\\" is \\"incomprehensible,\\" then  head for the Mystery section at your bookstore. I'd recommend reading a  page, tho', to see what all the shouting is about. For me, I knew I  couldn't look back, and Joyce has been a blessed thorn in my side for 20  years. Good gosh, what would I do without this man James Joyce, the last  heavyweight in the pantheon of godlike writers. ADDENDUM: I just celebrated my 30-year anniversary of my first read of \\"Finnegans Wake.\\" I wish I were younger; so, I'd have more time to spend with it. To the Wake's admirers: are we all a bunch of freaks? Or are we just really turned on by words in general. To the haters: everything in the Wake is there for a purpose, and yes, has meaning. Joyce was the most disciplined writer of all time. And please, folks, he didn't write it to tick you off. Really. (And the edition pictured is NOT the one to purchase; you must buy the edition incorporating all of the author's corrections. Viking Press, I think.) The last italicized word in the Wake is \\"Flood.\\" Just threw that out there. Homer? Took the epic as far as it could go. Shakespeare? The most eloquent writer ever. Joyce? Took words as far as they can go. (Maybe TOO far, judging by all of the 1-star reviews!)	2000-01-25
