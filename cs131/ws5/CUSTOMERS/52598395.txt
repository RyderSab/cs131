Might be a little difficult to unde for young kids	I like the look of this book over \\"365 Read-Aloud Bedtime Bible Stories\\", but not its content.  While the stories are virtually the same this author seems tries to be more poetic in describing the stories.  I found she used words my 4 - year old did not understand. I found myself reading ahead and replacing some of the words I felt my child would have difficulty with.<br /><br />I suppose when my daughter reaches reading age she will like this book more.  The illustrations on these pages are nice.	2004-09-20

Each story is a page long with two questions at the bottom.  The questions are usually simple, but help to reinforece the story.  I can also see why others have said this would be a good book for adults wanting to learn about Christianity.<br /><br />I don't know if I would recommend this book as an introductory to Christianity, but for a new Christian trying to understand the Bible this would be a great book.  Many new Christians have felt intimidated going to church and seeing others who seem to know all the Bible stories by heart.  This book can be a quick introduction to the stories.  But I would not recommend this to be your only source.  Get an easy translation of the Bible and rad along with these stories and that will be helpful.	2004-09-20

I was looking for a reading light that allowed me to read in bed without turning on a light.  This light wedge did the trick.  It is an interesting gadget.  By illuminating the plexiglass your book page underneath also gets lit.  I will admit it was difficult to get use to.  Having to move this from page to page was annoying at first, but I got the hang of it soon enough.  The glass does scratch easily.  Whether or notep it in its protective foam it will get scratched.  Most of the scratches come from the paper pulp itself.<br /><br />All in all this is a great light and I have been enjoying it for almost a year now.	2004-09-20

Everyday she asks if we are going to the hospital to pick up her baby sister (she insists it will be a girl).  We chose this book because we had read that other books talked about conception and we thought for a 3-year old that was a little much.<br />The author does a great job of explaining issues about what life will be like when the younger sibling arrives.  This is a must for all those expecting a new arrival.  Also the author's picture book regarding this subject is exceptional.	2003-05-05

After reading 4 Drizzt books in a row, I needed a change.  This series seemed like a good choice.  I like the character development, except they were a slightly predictable.<br />The only thing that disappointed me was the authors storytelling technique.  It seemed choppy and it jumped around a bit.  The author would set the scene and tell you what was happening.  Then right when you are ready to ask, &quot;Explain how this character got to this point&quot; the author would give you a paragraph, or two, explaining what happened in between scenes.<br />His writing style did not have a smooth flow and can be confusing.  But still it was worth the read.	2003-04-25

Even if you know your CFML and ActionScript it is best that you have developed a couple of projects first (before trying this book).<br />I personally like the layout of the book.  Yes it takes a little getting use to.  I did not realize some people disliked the unimaginative way most computer books are written.  Having notes pasted in at odd angles gives the book a &quot;real world&quot; feel.<br />I have only looked at the mail client example, but from that I am very impressed with the book.  The code provided in the book was straight forward and easy to follow.<br />I am a CF programmer by trade.  While I know some Flash, I would not consider myself an expert.  The Flash coding was what slowed me down the most.  However, after completing the mail client I must say my Falsh skills have improved (but I am still no Hillman Curtis).<br />If you are an advanced CF user who knows Flash, this is the book you have been waiting for.  Even though this book is beyond the beginner-intermediate level, I would encourage them to read the book lightly.  There are many concepts that are explained in this book that could shed some light on CFMX and Flash.	2002-10-24

This is not your typical instructional book.  Do not purchase this if you are just learning CF.  For the advanced user who wants to learn CF project development (pertaining to intranets) grab this book.<br />I love the concept of this book.  Currently my bookshelves are lined with books that give me snippets of code explaining the various tags in CFMX.  This book assumes (requires) you know CFML and don't need an explanation of the tags or their attributes.  You become part of the development team.  As you read this book you will see how this team will build a content management system.  Starting from an idea and ending with a working CMS (hopefully) you will learn the \\"big picture\\" of CFMX.<br />With most basic instructional books it can be difficult to see how all your .cfm modules will fit into one grand application.  This book will help you.The book is filled with mock notes and memos from the team members discussing requirements and ideas for the CMS.  Also the code used is written out for you.  The code is divided into small coherent pieces and there are plenty of editorial comments to explain the team's methodology.<br />If you are looking for code you can cut-and-paste from a CD; look elsewhere.  This book is to give you real-world experience coding a project.  Simple pasting modules into you CFMX server would not teach you anything.  Besides, if all the code for the CMS you are building was placed on a CD, it would be easy to just copy the files onto your intranet and have the worlds cheapest CMS available...	2002-10-24

The way Ben (and Nate) lay out real-world examples helps visualize the concepts. Many of the examples in the book not only show you how to use a particular tag, but also give additional notes to enhance performance.<br />I am particularly impressed with the attention they give to the application.cfm file.  The previous versions of this book never seemed to fully explain the many uses for the file.<br />So far the chapters on session scope and security have been a great help, but I am also looking forward to delving into the charts chapter.<br />I have yet to fully read this book, but I am impressed with the fact that almost 300 pages is devoted to using &quot;Client-side&quot; Java within CFMX.<br />For anyone wanting to learn CFMX I suggest getting this book.

The Magehound is an excellent opening to what looks like an intriguing trilogy. In this book magic rules the land, and the author does an excellent job describing the laws that govern this world. The characters are very interesting. I believe Kiva will become a villain readers will love to hate. I like that Ms. Cunningham uses more fanciful creatures withing this storyline. Readers tire of the same goblin raids and epic battles against dragons. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is a fan of the FR world.	2001-08-24

With it, a programmer should be able to develop for most platforms.  Currently, REBOL supports 40 platforms by using 10 built-in Internet protocols.  REBOL can exchange GUI content.  Not only from machine to machine, but from users to machines.<br />This book shows you the basicis of what you can do with REBOL.  It is a quick read, so you can make some development decisions without investing a great deal of research time.  The book is easy to read and I preferred it over the typical &quot;Dummies&quot; book.<br />It is however, debateable as to whether you can get more from going to the REBOL website.  If you are an experienced programmer the website may become your source.  If you are a new programmer looking for &quot;cutting edge&quot; languages, but prefer to learn in a more casual manner, get this book.	2000-12-04

If you are questioning whether this book is right for you, you just need to answer the question; Do you want to be an intermediate Flash developer or an advanced Flash developer?  Anyone wanting to be a the top of Flash development will realize the need to understand ActionScripting.<br />The book tries to explain how you can write scripts that increase interactivity for your users.  The book covers everything from Variables and Data Types, to Conditionals and Loops, to Built In Objects and XML Objects.<br />If this book falls short anywhere its that it could be longer.  At barely 300 pages the author tries to be too brief in explaining a subject that could occupy a book twice this size.<br />The fact that you won't find any other books that cover ActionScripting as well as this book is why I would advise purchasing it now.  You could wait until late Jan/Feb 2001 and see if &quot;Flash 5 Magic ActionScript&quot; will be better, but that was a chance I was not willing to take.	2000-12-04

Otherwise beware.  This book sets you up for learning the how to use the Microsoft endorsed tools for db programming.  For that purpose this is a good book.<br />Where this book falls apart is trying to teach you Oracle stored procedures and programming.  You are better off getting a book specific to Oracle 8i.  The SQL also is not Oracle friendly.  If you want a good understanding of SQL, there are a number of books I would recommend over this one.<br />By no means is this a bad book, it is just tailored more towards the Microsoft way of life than the Amazon review would lead you to believe.

I bought it so that members of my team who were not experienced with Flash could understand quickly how the program worked.  Once we received the book I looked it over and was impressed with what I saw.<br />As the name implies this book teaches visually.  Pages are divided in half. One column for an explanation in text, and one column with a visual example or illustration.  Also, as the name implies this is a Quickstart guide.  You will not become an expert Flash user from just this book.  It is not designed for that.  You will however, have a basic understanding of the program after reading and using this book.<br />One thing this book lacks are lessons.  If you are a person who learns best from having mock scenarios to complete, this book is probably not for you.<br />Another thing this book lacks is Flash concept.  Once you know how to use Flash, you need to know the concepts of designing a Flash site.  You won't find much of that in here.<br />I must say I was impressed with the amount of space the author gives to the Flash drawing tools.  She spells the first half of th book describing what many authors describe in a couple of chapters.  Most authors assume you know how to use graphic tools, this author guides you nicely through them.  Its not until chapter 8 before she begins talking about animation and tweening.<br />For the Flash newbie, grab this book.  You will use it as an instructional guide and a nice reference tool.  Other Flash users may want this book just as a quich reference guide.	2000-11-21

There are no earth-shattering revelations and your not going to find any truisms here (which is the case with most fantasy novels).<br />The characters are constructed fairly well.  The villians are truly the most developed characters.  I found myself anticipating  what would happen to the villians more than I did the heroes.  In fact, if this weren't a Harpers book this could have made a nice starting point for a villians series.<br />To me the story reads like a good translation of a D&amp;D module (unlike &quot;Against the Giants&quot;).

Charles Mohnike has filled a niche that seems to be lacking in other books.  This is truly a beginners book.<br />While being a good beginner's lesson book, I would not use it as a day-to-day reference book.  This is where both of Ben Forta's books shine.  I bought this book for one of the members in my team and once he finished with it, it was placed on the bookshelf and ignored.

Lets face it there are no truly advanced Flash books available.  All Flash books assume you know little more than rudimentary tweening skills.<br />This book does expect you to know more than just your tweens, which is good.  Many of the topics in this book can't be found in any other books.  The designers even do a decent job showing you how to re-create their designs (although little concept and reasoning is applied to their actions).<br />The problem with the book is the tutorials are specific to the design created. This is probably the same reason advanced Flash books are not published.  There are no generalized tutorials.  If you are lucky enough to pull pieces from the designs and use them within your own , great.<br />As far as the designs themselves, they are inspiring, but you can view them on the web for free.  By going to the designers web sites you can view their protfolios and see their work.  Of course, they won't provide the tutorials.<br />This is a nice book to get ideas from, I just wish it had more instruction and reference material.	2000-11-10

Its to the point that sometimes you wonder whether Macromedia should even try writing the manuals.  The UltraDev manuals are no exception.  While the manual tells you about UltraDev's features and the basic steps for those features, they rarely give good real world examples.<br />That where this book comes in.  As the name implies the author will get you using UltraDev quickly.  The author does a good job showing how to connect your web pages to databases.  Included are examples for ColdFusion, ASP, and JSP.  The author also goes into using XML to generate custom menus and dialog boxes.<br />With so few books available on this program, this is a must have.  The book did get me up-and-running quickly, but I can see there will be a point soon where the book will have outlived its purpose.<br />Get this book if you are like me, new to UltraDev.  Even if you are experienced in the Dreamweaver environment, but haven't been using UltrDev, this book will help.  Since I am not experienced with UltraDev I can't speak to how effective the book is for experts.	2000-11-07

The problem is this book was not meant for the marketing person as a lesson on how to brand their company on the Internet.  This book was written for the web designer, as an introduction to branding.<br />The book itself has a problem in that the only company profiled that can be considered a success would be Yahoo!  Anyone who uses the Internet regularly will recognize most of the other sites, but has anyone ever bought anything, or even visited these sites?<br />The author claims that when people are faced with unclear choices they will revert to what is comfortable, which is true.  The question that arises is, other than Yahoo! do you feel comfortable with any of these companies.  It seems the author chose second-tier websites because the top-tier weren't available.	2000-10-30

I enjoyed this story and the characters were fun to read about.  This is not an earth shattering piece of fantasy fiction, but it is good.  It is the type of book you read just for pleasure, with no expectations.<br />I have never played the computer games, so I can't atest to whether the book follows a similar storyline.

The code is fairly straight forward that seeing screenshots instead of code snippets seem to be a waste.<br />The book might be helpful to the absolute beginner as a lesson in HTML.  Beyond that I can't imagine using this book as an everyday reference guide.<br />Also, the book does not go into as much depth as some books, like HTML: The Definitive Guide (O'Reilly Press).

When people e-mail me with book suggestions this one is always on the top of my list.  I have yet to hear any negative responses.<br />Of all the shark books I have seen, not only is this the most organized, but it is also the most complete.

There are a host of beginner guides out there, but few are written and put together in such a way that even the casual PC user can understand them.  Also the format is consistent from book-to-book.  So if you have read one &quot;Dummies&quot; book you will feel comfortable with another.<br />The Windows Me OS is a perfect topic for this type of book.  Typically, the casual user wants a quick concise answer to a question without needing to read a complete history on why Microsoft decided to implement the change that is causing him/her trouble.

Since most people learn visually the concept seems interesting.  The best desription I can think of is a classroom in a book.  If you were taking a class to teach you Dreamweaver 3 your instructor would more than likely show you screenshots to walk you through the lesson.  That is what this book does, walk you through the lesson visually.<br />Unfortunately, the visual concept seems to be light on explanations, especially when there are exceptions.  Also, in a classroom setting you have the luxury to ask an instructor any questions, you can't with this book.<br />This is a great book for the absolute Dreamweaver beginner.

Its concept of web design with minimal coding appeals to many new designers.  This is also a downfall, especially with more experienced designers who like to type all their code themselves.<br />Most of the books available for Dreamweaver have focused on how to use the basic functions of Dreamweaver, ignoring things like database connectivity with ColdFusion.<br />This book not only covers the basics of HTML, but it goes into some more advanced topics like CF.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who is serious about web design with Dreamweaver.	2000-10-23

As I started to read this book (yes I read computer books cover-to-cover, pretty sick) I realized I had better pull out some of my Java books as references.  This book is not for the inexperienced Java programmer.<br />Trying to read this book without a solid grasp of the language will prove difficult and possibly frustrating.  I had a couple of my students look through this book after class and I could see their eyes just glaze over.<br />So far, I have found this is a very authoritative book on XML &amp; Java, but be warned it is not for the faint of heart.	2000-10-19

Everyone saying that XML is the &quot;wave of the future&quot;.  Actually, it is the &quot;wave of the present&quot;.<br />If you are a web designer and you still don't use XML, you are behind the curve.  This book will catch you up quickly and help you understand how XML will organize you pages and save you time. Clearly written, this book was an ease to read.<br />If you aren't a web designer, don't start with this subject.  Learn your HTML and then come back and get this book.	2000-10-19

My regard for O'Reilly Publishers is so high I will often purchase books from them without checking reviews.<br />The subject matter is not many authors are willing to tackle.  Not many people can compitently write a book about Java programming for XML.<br />The audience for this book is unique though.  You must know Java and not know XML.  If you don't fit both qualifications this book is probably not for you.<br />Being a beginner Java programmer, I struggled a little with the code, but I was able to keep up after a couple reads through some chapters.<br />All in all this is a great book and I reccomend it to those programmers who think their brains aren't full enough already.	2000-10-19

If youwant a book that will teach you more than the usual annoying web trick(window:open, mouseovers, etc) get this book.<br />As far as I can telltheir code examples are virtually bug free.  Usually any errors areposted with corrections on their web site...<br />Even if you are brandnew to JavaScript I would suggest buying this book as your reference.Then go to the web and learn basic JavaScript from one of the manyJavaScript tutorials available on the web.	2000-10-19

The author didn't get to look this way by sitting around on the beach drinking Pina Colada's.<br />This is an excellent book for those who have just learned XML and want to go to the next level.  This is a hardcore book for the hardcore web designer.<br />It is not difficult to read or understand, just a lot is explained in its meager 700+ pages.  I love the book and can't wait until my next project to implement some of the teachings.  This is a great book for those of us who actually stay at home and code on Friday and Saturday nights.	2000-10-19

Lie gives clear examples od CSS and the layout of the CSS classes is very clear.<br />I purchased the first edition a few years ago, and have now updated with this book.

Instead of preventing the thief from stealing your car, just track them down and apprehend them.

Also, just because most web pages make the same mistakes, itg doesn't mean you should follow suit.<br />This book is meant for the experienced web designer.

One of the current buzz terms around is &quot;usability&quot;. Everyone likes to advertise their sites are designed with the user in mind when very little usability testing is truly done.<br />I had the pleasure of attending a conference where Jared was speaking and listened to him for a day long lecture on usability.  It was the first time I had thought about the &quot;usability&quot; of a web site.<br />This book covers much of the &quot;research&quot; UIE has done on usability.  The problem with the whole concept of usability is, does it really matter?  People tend to adapt to what they are given.  If you give them crap and that is all they know, then they will adapt to it and use it.<br />This is how many badly designed pages are successful.  This will probably not last (can anyone say boo.com).  Eventually people will want good design.<br />Jared's book opens the door, but I don't think it is the answer (nor do I think Jared considers this the answer).  Usability testing takes time and money, two things most designers lack.  So until he can develop a quick method of testing usability, the jury is still out.	2000-10-18

This was my favorite AD&amp;D module as a kid.  Unfortunately this book read like a module and less like a novel.  It was almost painful reading  about Lhors' encounters in the city.<br />Describing characters like Malowan  as a &quot;paladin&quot; seemed unimaginative.  With a good description the  reader would have understood he was a paladin.  I almost expected  characters to introduce themselves as &quot;I'm a thief with a dexterity of  15; what about you?&quot;<br />I did not like the magic system in the book,  because it also seemed modulized.  There was nothing mystical about his  powers, it was all a matter of memorization.  I could envision the wizard  discussing with the other characters, &quot;Should I memorize 7 reveal  spells and 10 silence spells, or 9 reveal spells and 6 silence  spells?&quot;  Also, there was never any doubt the wizard would have a  spell that would keep the party undetected.<br />I also agree the two main  characters Lhors and Vlandar were the least interesting.  The history of  the two characters was weak.<br />This would have made a good trilogy.  The  encounters with the frost and fire giants were rushed.  Neither the  characters nor myself wanted the adventure to continue past the hill giant  lair.<br />If you loved the module, then go ahead and read the book just to  bring back memories.  I just wish a better storyline about giants would be  created.  I am getting tired of reading about dragons.	1999-11-29

I liked the way the authors structured the information in the for of answers to some basic questions people have about sharks.  If I had any complaints it would be about the shortage of color pictures.  Also all the color pictures were inserted as plates into a 12 page section of the book, instead of over the whole book.
