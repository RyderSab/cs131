The effort to use campaign experience as business expertise is awkward and doesn't quite work.	2002-02-07

He was not trying to advance an ideology. Lomborg looked into the science of current environmental woes and discovered... things are a lot different (and a lot better) than we've been led to believe.<br />What makes Lomborg's book refreshing and valuable is that it is NOT politically motivated. He is no apologist for industry; rather, Lomborg embarked on an objective examination and learned that the real ecological situation is markedly different from what those who make a living preaching eco-doom want you to think.<br />All sides of the issue will find much to be angry with here. But if they're honest, they'll find a lot of truth, too. It's proof of Lomborg's even-handedness.	2002-02-07

Bernie Goldberg can reveal the truth about how media bias works, and have it matter -- since he is an \\"insider\\" himself. More importantly, he is not a conservative ideologue, as he points out. That keeps his book from being tossed in the remainder bin of \\"right-wing-anti-media-rant.\\"<br />In addition, his argument is unique. The media is not left-leaning by intention, Goldberg writes, or because they're the dupes of some liberal cabal. Rather, it's because the media only knows other members of the media -- well-educated, wealthy, generally northeastern individuals. And those folks are liberals, more often than not. It's a benign \\"conspiracy,\\" but Goldberg says that makes it all the worse: They really don't know they're biased.<br />Goldberg richly reveals his own personal experiences, and these make the book strong. But they also house the book's one real flaw. While Goldberg is sincere in stating that \\"Bias\\" is not a personal vendetta against CBS, his outrage at the bias he witnessed there too often comes across as personal anger and hostility. Because he writes in a breezy, conversational style, Goldberg is unable to fully show that this isn't just a hurt-feelings hit-back. That leaves him open to criticism that his otherwise-well-crafted argument doesn't deserve.	2002-02-07

But on closer inspection, the arguments he cooks up result in a serious case of intellectual indigestion.<BR>Schlosser, a talented writer and even better self-promoter, came to fame with the 2001 publication of the book. With the help of the media, which hyped the book without challenging Schlosser's &quot;facts,&quot; Fast Food Nation made The New York Times bestseller list. Many publications put it on year-end lists of the &quot;best books of 2001&quot; -- resulting in renewed interest.<BR>Schlosser was smart enough to know that a study of the intricacies of the &quot;fast food&quot; industry would not appeal to most book-buyers. So instead of presenting an objective investigation of this major industry, or giving a fair shake to companies like McDonald's (which offers one in 15 Americans entr√©e into the workforce), Schlosser used &quot;fast food&quot; as the basis for a rhetorical assault on capitalism.<br />&quot;Greed&quot; is the ingredient that gives Fast Food Nation its flavor. Schlosser seems utterly shocked that these businesses exist... in order to make money! And to rage against business, Schlosser had no problem in engaging in what The Wall Street Journal called &quot;cavalier manipulation of data.&quot;<BR>Fast Food Nation is piled high with anecdotes and served with a heaping helping of skewed data. It's all intended to support Schlosser's case that &quot;fast food has infiltrated every nook and cranny of American society&quot; in harmful ways. It's not about the food itself; Schlosser himself says fast food tastes &quot;pretty good&quot; and that &quot;the odds are low that eating a burger is going to make you sick.&quot; Instead, it's a diatribe against the very concept of making a profit by creating a product that consumers enjoy.<BR>Schlosser says he doesn't eat &quot;ground beef anymore,&quot; but not because he's &quot;worried about gettingsick from it; I'm pissed off at the corporate greed.&quot; He blasts McDonald's for reaping in &quot;17 cents in pure profit&quot; on every large Coke it sells, assuming that the sort of people who buy his book (at a profit to the author) will be disgusted by the notion of making money. <BR>But he's strangely silent on the benefits to consumers of a hamburger that costs only a dollar -- except to use this, too, to attack the industry. Schlosser claims that &quot;increasing the federal minimum wage by a dollar would [only] add about two cents to the cost of a [99-cent] fast food hamburger,&quot; ignoring a nearly endless supply of available economic data to the contrary generated by university economists including winners of the Nobel Prize in economics. <BR>Instead, Schlosser uses one report from the Department of Agriculture to make his case -- and inappropriately at that. His two cents &quot;evidence&quot; comes from a study of labor costs and price hikes for the sale of prepared food and drinks in general, not just the fast food industry. More importantly, 75 percent of the employees studied were not even in the minimum wage range.<BR>Schlosser is too savvy a polemicist to let something as small as facts stand in the way of a good rant. Counting every minor scratch and bump, Schlosser claims that meatpacking is &quot;the most dangerous job in the United States.&quot; The government's Bureau of Labor Statistics disagrees. On its ranking of truly dangerous industries -- those with the most &quot;injury and illness cases involving days away from work&quot; -- meatpacking doesn't even make the top 25.<BR>But bad data and a lack of logic do not stop Schlosser from claiming the worst about the fast food industry. He tries to have it both ways on overtime hours, favorably noting that the Depression-era Fair Labor Standards Act placed limitations on mandatory overtime. <BR>Then, on the very next page, Schlosser complains &quot;managers try to make sure that each worker is employed less than forty hours a week, thereby avoiding any overtime payments.&quot; In fact, labor unions support the very practices Schlosser condemns, in part because they keep workers from being overburdened, and also because they encourage the creation of more entry-level jobs.<BR>This is not the only place where, despite Schlosser's progressive politics, he seems almost reactionary. Schlosser notes that &quot;inside job&quot; robberies at fast food restaurants occur because those they employ -- the young, poor, and minorities -- are also responsible for much of the nation's violent crime. Is he suggesting these at-risk individuals should not be given jobs and a chance?<BR>Decidedly selective in his presentation of data, Schlosser realizes that a cavalcade of deceptions is necessary to leave the reader with his funhouse-mirror image of the fast food industry, where fat-cat executives in fancy suits get rich while entry-level restaurant workers struggle to get by.<BR>These are just a few selections from Fast Food Nation's menu of mistruths. Schlosser, himself the wealthy son of a former NBC president, knows exactly what he is doing: Crafting a politically motivated weapon to fire against restaurants that play such a vital role in helping entry-level and at-risk Americans enter the workforce.<BR>Professional rabble-rousers like Schlosser pretend to care about those poorer than them -- just like Schlosser pretends to care about the facts. But in reality, these are just the means to an end: The glorification of political dogma at the expense of truth. And that is the most unappetizing morsel of them all.	2002-01-15

In novels such as Mysteries of Pittsburgh and Wonder Boys, Chabon dealt with smaller themes -- a neighborhood, a group of friends, a single small university, all centered in Pittsburgh. Here he shifts radically, moving swiftly between Nazi-occupied Prague, New York in the Forties and Fifties, and even Antarctica. While the book at times turns gimmicky or falls back on stereotypical comic characters (like the low-rent editor of the boys' comic book company), Kavalier and Clay is Chabon's best work by far, and that is saying a lot.	2002-01-15

But that does not mean her final work should go without scrutiny.<br />Olsen was one of the smartest of the recent crop of female conservative pundits, and I always found her insightful. But she had an anger about her that sometimes clouded rational argument. That unfortunate quality is on display in this book.<br />The shenanigans of the last days of the Clinton Administration were pretty blatant -- even once-loyal Democrats were appalled. It seems, then, that an objective, almost detached, examination of that period would have been more effective. Olsen instead deploys rancor and emotion. The result: The book comes off as one more right-wing attack, not a factual assessment of very real dirty doings.	2001-12-14

These days he just wants to talk about how important he is, and whine about why nobody wuvs him.<br />I realize I'm writing a review more of Bill than of the book. But they're interchangeable. Like so many talk-show host tomes, this isn't really a book at all, just an extension of a media franchise. If you still like O'Reilly, you'll like the book.

As such, we were unaffected by the hype, and bought the book purely out of curiosity. We were impressed.<br />The stories are a clever blending of the oldest sort of fantasy stories and modern sentiments and technology. Harry's quests smack of Tolkien, his upbringing of Dickens. But the gadgets and gizmos found around Hogwarts could come from Ian Fleming's spellbook -- part of what makes the stories fun.<br />Also admirable is that Harry is not the hero of every scene. His friends, and even hapless Neville, sometimes save the day. It's a refreshing break from the one-protagonist model of so much fantasy and children's literature.<br />I expect in fifty years these books will be as treasured as the Narnia series. But it is odd that a box set is for sale when every fan knows three more volumes are yet to come. I guess marketing casts strong spells of its own.	2001-11-30

This is, of course, the archetypal &quot;quest&quot; story, and in that regard succeeds. Tolkien revisits ancient hero stories and spins them all into an original odyssey -- made all the more intriguing by the fact that his heroes start off as meek and uninterested in adventure. In this respect, the books inspire readers to seek greatness within themselves.<br />However, where one word would do, Tolkien devotes entire chapters. I have read few books as needlessly verbose and rambling, and this took away from the experience. The Hobbit and Ring books are not for those with short attention spans. Indeed, some monastic hermits might even find them hard to bear.	2001-11-29

While I wonder if this book wasn't a bit unfair to Henriksson's students, his seamless weaving together of history examination errors into a Bizarro-universe world history is original and uproarious.<br />One warning: Some of the jokes will be lost on those unfamiliar with the minutae of history.

I am told many enjoy them, though I did not read them until I was an adult. As a former theology student, I found them enchanting, and an exciting and unique presentation of the principles of Protestant Christianity. I wonder, though, how much of the message is lost on younger readers.<br />I have read some of Lewis's &quot;adult&quot; books -- essays and &quot;Pilgrim's Regress&quot; -- and I feel the Narnia books are his best writing. Maybe that famously reserved man felt more free to express himself in this format, and more open since his intended audience was anticipating a yarn, not a proselytizing work. In any case, these are Lewis's best works, and I absorbed them quickly.<br />I concur with several other reviewers that rearranging the volumes is nonsensical, if not downright disrespectful to the artist. Lewis intended for the story to unfold in an oblique format, and this rejiggering is simply disruptive.	2001-11-29

With a unique and lively style, the author tells the generally unknown history of the Spiritualist phenomenon's role in the early U.S. women's movement.<br />Goldsmith discloses how the mid-19th century rise of Spiritualism impacted not just Woodhull but also better-known figures like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. As a side story, she also shows how Stanton's racism negatively impacted the drive for votes for women, and probably delayed suffrage by at least fifty years.<br />It's also the story of a compelling woman in Woodhull, who used charm, beauty, and &quot;street smarts&quot; to rise from poverty to prominence and wealth. She may have been a charlatan, but she had a greater impact on the lives of American women than previously revealed.	2001-09-30

Still, the book is one of the most enjoyable novels I've read of late.<br />Like Tolstoy or Dickens, Seth's novel is a grand epic potboiler, meant as an intelligent entertainment. It would be easy to imagine &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; broken up as a serial and spread across months of periodical publication. It is, in short, a soap opera, but a delightful and witty one.<br />It's not a deep book, but it is well-crafted and the characters -- not deeply drawn but intriguing nonetheless -- kept my attention. Despite the book's length, it flows quickly, and I found myself having passed 100 pages in what felt like the time needed for 20. Perhaps it's the simplicity of the story, but its 1,500 pages seemed like 400, so the length should not deter.<br />&quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; is a great light read even though the tome itself is heavy.

I am not a Johnson fan; in fact, my estimation of him is fairly low. So I was not partial to the book or seduced by the subject.<br />What makes this book great is that Caro concentrates on Johnson's rise, a ruthless and calculated &quot;path to power&quot; from LBJ's poor rural Texas roots to the United States Senate. We see how Johnson masterminded every action of his life from high school on, in order to gain influential friends and jump from East Texas to Washington, D.C. Most illuminating are the portions on Johnson's college years, when despite his unpopularity he was able to take over virtually every position of power available to students, and his days as an aide on Capitol Hill, where he first made himself more powerful than the congressman he served.	2001-08-31

Also like Atwater, it is essentially skin deep, offering little assessment on how a figure like Atwater could arise and become so powerful within the Republican Party so fast. There's also not much about Atwater's innovation -- &quot;oppo&quot; research-based politics that turned the nascent 24-hour news cycle to the advantage of the savvier campaign. Atwater invented the style of &quot;war room&quot; campaigning that was enhanced by another southerner, James Carville, four years later.<BR>Still, the book is well-crafted and does an excellent job of chronicling Atwater's life. It is especially admirable for revealing the truth about Atwater's alleged deathbed renunciation of hardball politics -- which never really happened. The real story is far more interesting.	2001-08-30

While a few of the stories are plausible, most here are intentionally comic and fantastic -- an all-Kennedy rock band playing for President Elvis Presley, or a neutered JFK forced to spend a chaste eternity in hell with Marilyn Monroe. Resnick's Alternates series is my personal favorite collection of alternate history stories, as editor Resnick has commissioned a wide variety of fiction writers in each to imagine alternate timelines and individuals. This one is well written, and good for laughs.	2001-08-28

Here, Horowitz tells the story of his red-diaper youth and his years in the socialist and Black Panther movements, and the murder that led him to reevaluate his politics. While Horowitz is a sparkling writer and entertains throughout, the narrative has two major flaws. The first is Horowitz's stubborn and juvenile refusal to take responsibility for his own actions -- hardly an attitude befitting a conservative! He justifies each radical swing of his life by blaming his peers and the times, never himself. Second, and related, is the emotionalism of his politics. Horowitz seems to have swung far right after coming to loathe the far left, but fails to justify his new politics as anything other than quite literally reactionary.	2001-08-28

The author is something of a long-winded blowhard, commenting at length (and I mean LENGTH) on every topic imaginable. In that respect he is America's Voltaire, creating reams of comment and interpretation on politics, the arts, and religion and morals. It's hard to say where Vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism, as he is not a conventional leftist. Because of his iconoclasm, this collection can only inform the reader about Gore Vidal, not his times nor any intellectual or political movement. All that said, Vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit. This book is much too much for the casual reader -- stick to one of his many shorter collections instead -- but for a Vidal fan (or, say, a reader of &quot;The Nation&quot;) this book is worth the time commitment.	2001-08-28

But he has a hard time sticking to that goal, and his efforts to justify each juicy tidbit with historical significance are increasingly herniating as the book plods on. Really, this is Woodward's book about the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment events of 1998. He does a workmanlike job of that, but others have done better with the same information. He tries to make the book about &quot;five presidents,&quot; but Clinton's travails get more than half the book to play around in. The first half of the book is excellent, though. There, Woodward concisely handles the scandals faced by Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush -- remember the Bert Lance Affair? me neither -- and shows how an ever-more-suspicious media and public influenced each White House's handling of the same. For the first 200 pages alone, the book is worth the read by students of the presidency. But if you're just looking for Clinton dirt, dig elsewhere.	2001-08-28

Strom Thurmond's remarkable march across 20th century politics. But they don't do anything else. While it is interesting just to read about a politician so long-lasting that he ran for president in 1948 and still holds office today, the book does not attempt to delve into the meaning of Thurmond's extraordinary tenure. Thurmond's political career is a mirror of the evolution of the South from Dixiecrat to Republican, from racist to mainstream conservative. The authors opted not to tell this story, however, and stubbornly insisted on offering just a journalistic account of Thurmond's life.	2001-08-28

Kershaw gets past the myths of Hitler to present a detailed, encyclopedic examination of his early life and rise to power. He manages the neat trick of remaining relatively dispassionate and objective about Hitler's political evolution. Kershaw also takes other historians to task for their assertion that Hitler was an energetic genius, revealing that much of the time Hitler was lazy and slothful and could not be bothered to pay attention to matters that did not intrigue him. The one downside of the book is that, in refusing to indulge the Hitler mythos, Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris can be a bit dry in stretches. Still, it's worth it to see this new interpretation of Hitler's life and career.	2001-08-28

The story of the Ochs/Sulzburger clan appeals on two levels. First, it is the story of the making of the newspaper, the ethical and financial decisions required to make the Times both reputable and profitable. And second, it is a good old scandal story, filled with affairs and family altercations, and Times Square palace intrigues. While the book remains superficial about the journalism, it delves deeply into the characters, who are of course the most fun part of the tale.	2001-08-28

Matalin especially is willing to fess up to her errors of judgment near the top of the Bush campaign, and bravely reveals what it's like to see a candidate you support and love see victory slip away. But the Carville/Matalin relationship is a bit too cute for politics, and the he said-she said back and forth of the book gets stale after the first couple hundred pages. With the exception of the personal looks inside the campaigns, there's little new here, and nothing that hasn't been covered better by other chroniclers of that strange election year. Matalin and Carville are both very good at what they do, but what they do is not professional writing, and neither is very good at it.	2001-08-28

While Reelecting Lincoln necessarily deals with the issues of the Civil War -- not to mention the bizarre circumstance of holding a presidential election under cannonfire, with half as many states as four years prior -- the book is about elections, not the presidency. That interim period between the modern primary and convention system and the pre-partisan campaigns of the Federal era are disclosed. In Campaign 1864, not only was it not odd for a president's own Cabinet to mull challenging the boss for his party's nomination, it would have been odd if Cabinet members had not. And with no polls and no primaries, candidacies rose and fell entirely in the salons of Georgetown and the conversations in D.C. pubs -- an elegant set of smoke-filled rooms. Abraham Lincoln does play a central role, but as the savviest politician of his time, not as a president trying to run a war. The book's most amusing moments come as Lincoln lulls his rivals into thinking him a dull-witted country bumpkin, doomed to lose renomination, not to mention the White House -- then going on to a landslide win.	2001-08-28

The Washington Post's Peter Baker took a topic everyone was sick of, and summarized it -- sticking to what really mattered. The book chronicles the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Period. Baker shows what went on behind the scenes, what deals were cut to keep Clinton in office, and the ambivalence of Republican leaders about pursuing a politically unpopular course. He shows why some members of both parties came to loathe Clinton, and how Clinton's own lieutenants felt. And he reveals why events unfolded as they did, and how once started, the process could not be stopped -- despite the efforts of some Republicans to &quot;turn off impeachment&quot; for fear of rushing down the wrong track of history. This is not a book about sex, nor a book about the Clinton marriage. Baker is writing a history for history, and sifts through all the pundit babble and misdirected salaciousness to report accurately on one of the most important events of recent American history. For anyone who was transfixed by the magnitude of the events but couldn't stomach the way it was handled by much of the press, this is the book for you.	2001-08-28

However, it remains an esoteric pleasure for those who are aware of it. With some of the most beautiful illustrations of any book I've ever seen, and a fully imagined landscape of a past America, Michael Flanagan creates a fictional world that crosses tracks with our own. In addition to the narrative, which is fine, one can enjoy the story just by flipping through the many pictures -- bent and torn &quot;photographs&quot; of decaying and dying old towns along a railroad line. This book works on several levels and is unlike any other book I've encountered.	2001-08-28

Like much alternate history, Resurrection Day has a great setup and a great idea, but the plot itself is strained. It is fascinating to read Dubois's vision of the United States ten years after a limited nuclear war, with President Kennedy maligned as the reason for the nation's collapse. The most original idea is Britain's smug condescension as the U.K. is called upon to offer aid and assistance to the now-impoverished United States.	2001-08-28

This was the first book I'd ever read on Dada and I found it quite sufficient -- all the personalities are introduced, and their motivations and how they came together are revealed. Richter is best in the earliest sections, while discussing the birth of the influential Cabaret Voltaire and how the First World War helped amplify Dada's influence in Europe. The book peters out a bit in later chapters, but is still a detailed look at the subject. If you are simply seeking an understanding of the movement, this book is a fast and entertaining read.	2001-08-28

It pains me to give American Aurora a relatively negative review, as the book was entertaining and well-prepared. I must do so, however, because the book offers only part of the story. James Thomas Callendar is one of the most amusing characters of early American history -- the forefather of folks like Walter Winchell and Matt Drudge, the first American &quot;scandalmonger,&quot; as William Safire calls him. But he was motivated by money and personal pique, embracing and denouncing Washington, Adams, and Jefferson in turn to sell papers and whenever he felt one had slighted his ambitions. American Aurora focuses only on the period of the Alien and Sedition Acts and Callendar's campaign against Adams. The book makes Callendar out to be a John Peter Zenger-caliber hero of free expression, ignoring the fact that Callendar once praised Adams, and would later tarnish Jefferson -- Callendar's hero in American Aurora -- and breaking the story of Sally Hemings. This is a fun read. Too bad it's not the whole truth.	2001-08-28

I was disappointed largely because Harris seems less interested in his setting -- Berlin in 1964, under a 75-year-old Hitler and anticipating a visit by President Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. -- than in telling a detective story. If you like that sort of thing, you might enjoy this book but would be bored by what alternate history there is. If you're an alternate history fan, you'll be bored by the sleuthing. Harris does offer some entertaining visual descriptions of alternate Berlin, where Albert Speer's mammoth monuments and buildings have been constructed, but because of Harris's ambivalence about what kind of book this is, the result is the perfect novel for no one.	2001-08-27

Unlike most of Rushdie's other novels, Midnight's Children is almost relentlessly serious, with little of Rushdie's trademark quipping interfering with the progress of the story. And while some fans may miss it, it works, as Rushdie delves into magical realism to tell the story of children across India born at the stroke of the nation's independence in August 1947, and their telekinetic powers and ability to communicate with each other across great distances. In addition to mirroring the history of India during its first half-century as an independent, unified nation, Rushdie uses the children's &quot;superpowers&quot; as a metaphor for India's own erratic and often misdirected ascension as a nation-state.	2001-08-27

While Midnight's Children is Rushdie's best novel, Ground Beneath Her Feet is the most fun. It is not a book for someone who is not a veteran Rushdie reader, as the author's puckish jokes and references to pop culture abound, and would irritate anyone who hasn't learned to love his puns and wordplay. In some ways Ground Beneath Her Feet reminded me of what Kurt Vonnegut said about his Breakfast of Champions: it's a book the author wrote as a gift to himself. Here, Rushdie is riffing and having fun with language. If you don't take it too seriously, it's a great ride. (It's also tremendous fun trying to catch all the fictional characters who are alive in Rushie's alternate reality.)	2001-08-27

On top of that, Mysteries of Pittsburgh is a fun and funny book. In true Chabon form, it's hard to tell what to expect or what will come next -- is this a story about college friends, or a summer of partying, or budding bisexuality, or gangsters and gunfights? The answer: Yes. All of these elements are stirred together in this short book that can be read in an afternoon, and relatively successfully. While there are bumpy and awkward moments, Mysteries of Pittsburgh will please anyone who enjoyed Kavalier and Clay or who saw the film of Wonder Boys and wants a taste of the novelist who penned its inspiration.	2001-08-27

A parody of archaeologists' tendency to declare what we &quot;know&quot; about past civilizations based on their artifacts, the book presents the unearthing of a nondescript motel two thousand years after the sudden collapse of Western civilization. The fun is in the labeling of the various elements discovered: a showercap becomes a ceremonial death cap, a dinner tray an offering to the gods, a toilet seat a piece of sacred religious neckwear. Macaulay makes his point and has fun doing it. I pick up this book again and again whenever I'm in the mood for an intelligent chuckle.	2001-08-27

In novels such as Mysteries of Pittsburgh and Wonder Boys, Chabon dealt with smaller themes -- a neighborhood, a group of friends, a single small university, all centered in Pittsburgh. Here he shifts radically, moving swiftly between Nazi-occupied Prague, New York in the Forties and Fifties, and even Antarctica. While the book at times turns gimmicky or falls back on stereotypical comic characters (like the low-rent editor of the boys' comic book company), Kavalier and Clay is Chabon's best work by far, and that is saying a lot.	2001-08-27

I did not know about Michael Chabon until after seeing Curtis Hanson's film adaptation of Wonder Boys (robbed of a Best Picture nomination), and did not read Wonder Boys until much later, coming across several other Chabon works first. That said, it is hard to know how I would have reacted to Wonder Boys if I did not know the story in advance. Unlike the broader Kavalier and Clay, which is in all a better book, Chabon does not slip into occasional caricature here. Yes, the &quot;doped-up novelist with writer's block&quot; and the &quot;spooky, haunted young genius&quot; are archetypes, but Chabon's Grady Tripp and James Leer come off as original inventions due to Chabon's skill with subtlety. While revealing characters through a road trip is hackneyed, it comes off better in the novel than on the screen. Chabon's uniqueness lies in his combination of the mundane and the bizarre -- well-crafted characters wandering through a strange landscape. Wonder Boys is not the choice for a reader who wants just one Chabon experience -- Mysteries of Pittsburgh is odder and funnier, and Kavalier and Clay is bigger and better. But for a Chabon fan, Wonder Boys is an excellent diversion.	2001-08-27

Nick Hornby's &quot;NippleJesus&quot; is my favorite thing he has ever written, and Hornby is one of my favorite authors. Also good is a story by Colin Firth, an actor who really should write more often. The best story in the set is narrated by a cook in a prison's kitchen, who has the chore of preparing last meals for the condemned. But many of the rest are poor. The wonderful and brilliant Dave Eggers submits a gimmicky story narrated by a dog. It seems like he had the clever idea of such a story, but couldn't make it do anything but roll over and play dead. And Helen Fielding, who I'd never read before and don't plan to ever read again, submits a piece that proves why so many of my acquaintances find her irritating.	2001-08-24

What Cramer did in What It Takes is create a psychology of politics. He was not attempting to cover the election or go behind-the-scenes a la Germond and Witcover to expose the inside baseball. His goal was to show what sort of people run for president -- and what inner demons drive them to do it. It's interesting that this book predates Bill Clinton, as it was under Clinton that the presidential psyche went under the microscope. We've all read far too much about all Clinton was trying to prove and overcome. Here, we see a different set of men using the campaign for different kinds of therapy: The son of a strict religious upbringing trying to be a good boy despite his own desires (Gary Hart); the Boy Scout overachiever (Dick Gephardt); the injured veteran who had to prove his impairment did not make him less of a person (Bob Dole); the ambitious but cerebral climber who couldn't figure out why he was running (Mike Dukakis) and several more. Seeing what it takes to get through an election, and the damage it does to one's dignity, why do they do it? The names may be forgotten, but the story is worth reading even now.	2001-08-24

As such, many of the details in Hornby's memoir of a lifelong obsession with Arsenal seemed arcane to me. But, surprisingly, I found Fever Pitch to be one of Hornby's stronger efforts. It helped me see how an intelligent person could become preoccupied with sports, and come to see a team as a family -- even more important than one's actual family. In addition, the book is both funny and reflective, especially when the author's ambivalent empathy with football rioters can be seen through his disgust at their actions. A worthy read for any memoir fan, football enthusiast or not.	2001-08-24

The breadth of the book is astounding, even replacing such forgettable figures as Millard Fillmore and James Garfield to great effect. Some of the stories are fantastical -- protest candidates like Belva Ann Lockwood and Victoria Woodhull winning the White House pre-suffrage, and the bizarre world post-President Goldwater -- but most stay true to possibilities, like an unslain Huey Long winning the presidency in Depression-scarred 1936, or Mayor Daley casting his lot with Nixon over JFK in 1960. If you can find it, buy it.	2001-08-24

Mostly	I learned about this book through a third-party mailing list, and I did find it a lot of fun to read. Best of all was the extended Election Night sequence, written hour-by-hour as the returns came in. The author's story of a credible third party presidential candidacy is a page-turner, and brings up important questions about the perils of the Electoral College. However, Field spends far too much time promoting his own agenda, which is a sort of New Age progressivism, heavily reliant on alternative energy, vegetarianism, and drug legalization. No matter what one thinks of these views, a serious political analyst would know that they are anathema to most voters. The fact that the candidate's campaign is reborn when he announces he supports legalizing drugs is simply implausible. If you love close elections, read it for the campaign, and skip over the speeches. You won't be missing much.	2001-08-24

He writes with a barely veiled motive -- to cast doubt on the United States's dangeous and footloose way of choosing vice presidents -- and the book was clearly a product of the Quayle era, now almost forgotten. Still, his history of the federal government's most irrelevant office is detailed and thorough. But is this book still accurate? Quayle's successor, Al Gore, became the most involved vice president in history. And Gore's successor, Dick Cheney, has surpassed Gore in clout already. Gore and Cheney have redefined the office that once neutered figures like Hubert Humphrey, and hopefully this will lead to greater emphasis on veep choices in the future.	2001-08-24

That said, much of the book drags, as Roth preaches about NLP views on several issues at great length, and gives short shrift to the party's actual plans for future electoral action. Perhaps silliest -- though most telling about what a minor party must face -- is a lengthy section about the creation and publicity of just one press release.	2001-08-24

Many of them may seem to be caricatures, but for some that's the point -- to revel in the &quot;types&quot; they portray, and the special and peculiar realm of geekdom that music nerds inhabit. (Think of Phillip Seymour Hoffman in &quot;Almost Famous&quot; to picture the type.) Like his follow-up, the superior About A Boy, in High Fidelity Hornby follows a not-quite-adult man in his thirties as he learns about adulthood. Cocooned inside his music shop, Hornby's protagonist comes to see he is in exile from the world, not living in a castle of his own making. But I make it sound too serious. While there's a lot to think about in High Fidelity, it's also a terrifically funny book, and a quick read, great for the plane or for an afternoon of escapism.	2001-08-24

I think he is the epitome of the new wave of Internet journalists, and to some extent he inspired me in the creation of my own Orvetti.com. But he should stick to the Web. Drudge Manifesto reads like his website -- perhaps that's the point -- and is rambling and often incoherent. In short, there's no book here, just lots of snippets that Drudge doesn't even try to tie together. There is one section I highly acclaim, though: The bit at the end where Drudge quotes Peter Orvetti of the Orvetti Political Report.	2001-08-24
US	42498897	R3H4GDD9RYNLGO	1573227331	602052020	About a Boy	Books	5	0	0	N	N	His Best So Far	Devotees of Nick Hornby can see his craft develop through his early works, from a memoir (Fever Pitch) through High Fidelity to this excellent novel. In Fever Pitch Hornby wrote about himself, and in High Fidelity created memorable characters, many of whom were two-dimensional. But in that book he also created a complex, if rather extreme, protagonist, and his now-acclaimed skill at dialogue was revealed. About A Boy takes High Fidelity's promise to the next level. Here, Hornby shows a man-child learning how to be an adult -- but, more importantly, why that's worth doing, and why a life of sloth is not as fun as it sounds. He also manages the difficult task of creating a realistic child character, with all the awkwardness and uncertainty that a preteen geek would reveal. If you just want a sample of Hornby, read About A Boy first.	2001-08-24

His work seemed to improve with each novel, and so I was excited to learn of the release of How To Be Good. Unfortunately, I found the novel very disappointing. While the central question -- what does it mean to be a &quot;good person,&quot; and should one really have to struggle to do it -- is interesting, the book lapses too often into caricature. That's the point, Hornby might say, since the man &quot;being good&quot; in the book has a quasi-religious conversion from petty nastiness into sickening do-gooder self-righteousness. But too many of the other characters -- a strange masseuse cum guru, a ne-er-do-well brother, a lumpish mediocre Anglican minister -- wander into the book and are not given much to do. Hornby, a &quot;guy writer&quot; with a strong masculinity in his writing, deserves credit for creating a female narrator and protagonist, and he is actually quite successful. But she deserves a better book to live in.	2001-08-24

Maybe it's just that '88 was the first campaign I followed. But it was a dirty, sleazy fight, with two unappealing nominees. Both campaigns were riddled with mistakes -- Bush's choice of Quayle, then-frontrunner Dukakis refusing to campaign during August. Most interesting is the desperation inside the Democratic Party as they see their best shot in years collapse before their eyes. This is just a good, solid campaign book in the tradition of the old Making Of The President series.	2001-08-24

I have a bit of bias, as Adams has always been my adopted Founder, my favorite of the bunch. Popular history has all but ignored his pivotal role, and the success of McCullough's book will hopefully reverse that. In addition to providing the first detailed biography of Adams in years -- far surpassing Joseph Ellis's book -- McCullough also shows just what it was like to live at that time, as Adams crosses the ocean and mans a gun along with the crew, or spends months crossing mountains to meet his next diplomatic assignment. It's a great work of history, but also a great yarn. McCullough also gives ample space to Abigail Adams, one of the greatest female figures in early America, as well as budding diplomat John Quincy. But the author does lose a bit of credibility for glossing over Adams's complicity in signing the Alien and Sedition Acts -- an error history should forgive, but one that should not be ignored.	2001-08-24

The Germond/Witcover series is the best set of &quot;campaign books&quot; in recent years. And while the solid reporting continues in this effort, there's something missing. Many political junkies rank 1992 as the oddest election in memory, stranger even than the de facto tie of the 2000 race. Why? Two reasons: the inexplicable buoyancy of Bill Clinton, and the Perot phenomenon -- that brief springtime period when a businessman on a third party ticket shot to 40 percent in the polls while the Democratic nominee fell to third place (less than 25 percent!) and then recovered to win the election -- and oust an incumbent Republican who had polled a 91 percent approval rating less than two years earlier. Germond and Witcover tell the whole story, but the sense of the bizarre that pervaded that election is lacking.	2001-08-24

He is intelligent and cerebral, but comes off like a somewhat slick salesman. In this quick-read book, he makes strong and understandable cases for the positions he presented in his 1996 presidential campaign. Here, the salesman quality helps: Browne offers a persuasive conversation, rather than a dense, dry tome. Whether you agree with Browne's ideas or not, this book is a good way to quickly learn just what that &quot;other party&quot; that always seems to be on the ballot is all about.	2001-08-24
US	42498897	R748FSJZQRDAZ	0465045901	212702260	Smash Mouth: Two Years In The Gutter With Al Gore And George W. Bush -- Notes From The 2000 Campaign Trail	Books	3	15	15	N	N	Too Clever By 537 Votes	I enjoyed this book, but it's too clever by half. Milbank is a humorous and reasonably insightful political author, and he could have produced a great work on the 2000 campaign. Smashmouth's failings are less Milbank's fault than the fault of a churn-'em-out publishing culture that needs to race campaign books to the shelves before they're cooked. Basically, Smashmouth is just a recycling of Milbank's funny Washington Post columns from the campaign trail, wadded up and wrapped with a bit of flimsy conjunction. Besides creating a superficial and weak narrative, it also results in redundancy, as repeated puns (like &quot;JugGoreNaut&quot;) that might bring a chuckle once a week are repeated again and again just pages apart.	2001-08-24
