And is this type of business really conducive to an amateur sleuth series? It's nice that the author has a hobby she enjoys so much that she wants to turn it into a series, but I just don't see how this series can go very far with this premise.<br /><br />I thought the mystery itself was pretty straightfoward, with the culprit obvious almost from the beginning. I also found some of the character relationships silly -- Bradford and his aunt Lillian don't talk because she ate his banana pudding when he was a kid? Sara Lynn leaves her husband to move in with her sister who's in danger? I also found it a tad annoying how the characters always referred to each other by their relationship rather than their names since there weren't all that many of them and they're all related to each other.<br /><br />I'll give the next installment a shot, but I just don't see this theme holding my interest for very long.	2005-10-07

It comes across as awkward, juvenile and cliched. And the italicized asides are very annoying -- if there wasn't so much drivel, the asides could be worked into the actual conversations, rather than distracting the reader by appearing after Lacey speaks.<br /><br />Rose and Cherise were like a couple of cartoon characters. There was nothing believable or enjoyable about them at all. And it made no sense that an independent adult like Lacey would drag them around with her and put them in danger, catering to their idea that crime solving is fun, rather than putting her foot down that she had to work and they couldn't come tag along with her.<br /><br />On top of all this, the ending was very predictable. You could figure out the murderer almost as soon as he appeared in the story.<br /><br />I gave this series enough chances. I'm done with it.	2005-10-04
US	52063173	R17R5YF9DQPYB7	0425197085	563578537	After Hours	Books	2	1	2	N	Y	Predictable	I found this book very difficult to read. It started slowly and really didn't move along at a decent pace. Most of it seemed to drag on and on and on.<br /><br />Portia also came off as stupid and helpless, constantly whining about not having a man in her life. The story would've been a lot more interesting if she'd been portrayed as an independent woman who found herself having no choice but to rely on the help of a stranger. It also seemed to me that a good portion of the dialogue was Nick saying \\"Huh\\" or \\"Uh.\\" Talk about filler.<br /><br />And there was one thing that really bothered me. Perhaps in her effort to portray Nick as a New Yorker, he attended a Yankees/Rockies game. Any baseball fan knows that a Yankee/Rockies game would be a rare occurrence since they play in different leagues and would only meet once every three or four years. Then, while at the game, Nick looks around at the large crowd and thinks to himself how there are only 3000-4000 fans at a game on a weeknight back home. Again, misinformation since the Yankees normally draw 40000+ every night. Finally, the next night, his new cop friends invite him to a sports bar to watch the Yankees/Rockies game, which is \\"the fourth of fifth of a series.\\" Again, any baseball fan knows that most series are three games, a few are four games, none are five games. And an interleague series is *always* three games. To me, this whole \\"sidebar\\" showed me that the author did little to no research on something she felt the need to add to her story in order to develop her character.<br /><br />Lynn Erickson's put out much better stories. This one really wasn't worth the time.	2005-09-26

However, the author must've finally realized how overboard she was going with him, and with him toned down in this book, it was a much more enjoyable read.<br /><br />The Jerk is gone. Hallelujah! That was another thing that was getting tiring -- that Goldy would allow her ex-husband to continue to harass her, and that her cop husband wouldn't do something about it. With this thorn now gone, there seems to be much more potential for the characters.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I felt there were just too many characters to keep track of. Good for red herrings, bad for continuity.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next installment...and hoping the author doesn't slide backwards.	2005-09-18

And that's what this series has become...a suspension of belief.<br /><br />Not only do the police encourage the civilian Chris to solve their cases, but they enable her by providing her with all their information. Even her husband, a NYC cop, encourages and assists her. They let her enter crime scenes with them, they give her names and addresses of witnesses so she can interview them, they allow her access to all their evidence, they inform her when new information comes in. Her husband supports her as she withholds information and evidence from the police, and as she leaves her five-year-old son behind to fly around the country chasing clues. Even the victim's daughter gets in on the act, refusing to talk to the cops, but telling her story to and teaming up with a complete stranger with no ties to law enforcement or her family, who was called in by her parents' landlord simply because she stopped by to ask him questions about them a few days earlier. And of course we get our dose of Sister Joseph with her cryptic clues, which always enable Chris to suddenly come up with the solution to the crime.<br /><br />Having Chris be a housewife/mother/teacher no longer works. If she's going to continue to be involved in cases, then the author should make her a PI or send her to the police academy. You have to suspend so much belief where her involvement is concerned that it ends up taking away too much to make the stories enjoyable.<br /><br />The author has a gold mine on her hands with her new Manhattan series, so perhaps it's time to let Chris and Jack ride off into the sunset and concentrate her efforts on Jane Bauer.	2005-09-13

It seems that she's repeating the same ones from book to book, and with such a short series, it's not really that hard to remember something you've already read when you see it again.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that she didn't flesh out the storyline with Joy a bit more.

I had to go back to the author's website to see if I'd missed an installment because I was really surprised that she'd marry the characters off and have it happen \\"off-screen.\\" That could've been a book all by itself.<br /><br />I do sense the series will be winding down soon with all the hinting about April not feeling well, and her mother's potions to try to get her pregnant.

But in this book, it just stretched the imagination too much.<br /><br />Renie has been obsessed with a house since she was a child. Suddenly, 40 years later, she redevelops her obsession, mentions it to Judith, and brings her over to see the house. Next thing you know, Judith is showing up there on her own and gets involved in a murder mystery. She then proceeds to demand information on the murder from the cops, find lame excuses to show up at the house constantly, stalks the family members asking personal questions that are none of her business, and finally, breaks into the house in the middle of the night to satisfy her curiosity. And when all is said and done, the cops don't so much as arrest her on the breaking and entering charge, because she smiles warmly at them while telling her story.<br /><br />As the series has continues to regress, so have the characters. Judith has always been an annoying, nosy buttinsky, but she's crossed the line to unbearable. Renie has gone from mildly humorous to downright idiotic. Gertrude, who used to be the best characters in the series, has become a cranky afterthought. At times, it almost seems like Mary Daheim is going for the slapstick of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plus/Lula/Grandma Mazur, only she's failing miserably. Even the secondary characters, such as Phyliss, Mike and the Rankers, have gone over the top to the point that the whole lot of them come off looking like morons.<br /><br />It's time for Ms. Daheim to stick a fork in this series and concentrate on her Alpine series. While that one is also starting to go downhill the longer it goes on, it's still better than the garbage this series has become.	2005-08-26

I found the shifting viewpoints distracting, especially in the beginning of the book when I didn't know who half these people were.

There's nothing even remotely likeable about Sam -- she's stupid and shallow. She was so broke she had to move herself and her two sons in with her grandfather, yet she used her husband's life insurance money for a boob job and slut wardrobe, rather than for her kids' future?<br /><br />This series tried to be Stephanie Plum from the beginning, but Jennifer Apodaca will never ben Janet Evanovich. Perhaps if she'd realized that from the start, her series would've worked. Exchanging ruined clothes for blown-up cars and private investigating for bounty hunting doesn't work, and this series has just become so flat-out bad that I won't even pick up the next book in the series.	2005-07-23

What an absolute disaster.<br /><br />Kill off an animal for no good reason and you've already lost me. But what was worse was the way Lucy reacted to seeing her \\"beloved family pet\\" run over in the street. Her first thought? Rushing over to the neighbors to offer forgiveness for the hit & run, see if the neighbor's car was damaged and offer restitution if it was. If someone ran over my dog without stopping, I'd be paying them a visit alright -- but not to offer restitution...rather, to make sure their car never made it onto the road again. Lucy's been a moron in the last few installments of the series, but this one really took the cake.<br /><br />And the murder was pointless. It just kind of happened, and then it just kind of was solved. Nothing Lucy said or did solved it -- she just happened to go to the person's house to pick something up and they confessed. And, frankly, I really had no idea who this person even was, since they really hadn't been mentioned throughout the story.<br /><br />And what was maybe the worst part -- on page 240, while everyone is attending a baseball game, we get this gem regarding the National Anthem: \\"The singers belted out the last words of the song - \\"and the home of the free...\\". These are *not* the correct words to the National Anthem. Ms. Meier should be ashamed of herself for including this in the book and getting it wrong..and she should be equally ashamed of her crack editing team for missing it as well.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or your money.

As much as I enjoyed \\"Point Deception\\" and \\"Cyanide Wells,\\" I wish Ms. Muller would make a new installment of Sharon her first priority so that we get at least one every year.<br /><br />A few reasons I enjoyed this one so much:<br /><br /> - It was nice to take a trip down memory lane and remember some of the old cases. I started reading Sharon many years ago, so I enjoyed having my mind nudged on some of her previous adventures. I may have to go back now and read some of the earlier books again.<br /><br /> - Little to no Rae. For some reason, this is the one character in this series to whom I've never been able to warm up.<br /><br /> - No Hy smothering. I might be in the minority, but I'm not a fan of Sharon's relationship with Hy, so I was glad there wasn't too much of him in this book. One of the things I love most about Sharon is her independence -- she works hard and takes care of herself. Since Hy entered her life, now we have private planes and second/third homes, and access to the highest tech gadgets and world-class security. It's made Sharon seem a bit less believable. Unfortunately, based on the ending, it looks like this will only increase in the future, and I just hope Ms. Muller keeps it under control and doesn't completely ruin the character.<br /><br />I anxiously look forward to the next book and hope I don't have to wait two years for it.	2005-06-23

I finally fell asleep with the book in my hand. Unfortunately, when I woke up and began reading again, something jumped right out at me in the first five minutes that made it obvious where the storyline was going -- something I might not have picked up on as quickly if I'd fallen asleep a bit earlier or later and it hadn't been so obvious to my fresh mind.<br /><br />I do think there were low points -- the characters were caricatures whom you really couldn't grow to care about very much. Some of the plot twists were really implausible, such as the coincidences of Casey's storyline and Ashley being left alone in a dorm on the grounds of a huge academy right after the tragedies she'd just been through, with only two police guards to keep an eye on her. I also was surprised that the final chapter involved wrapping up Joshua instead of Ashley, since she'd been the main character throughout the story.<br /><br />Regardless, it's still a worthwhile read that'll leave you unable to put it down until you have to.	2005-06-03

I should've known that!\\" This only left you thinking \\"Oh, it was him.\\" It could have ended up being any of them and I wouldn't have been surprised.<br /><br />Still though, it's MHC, so it's definitely worth the read.	2005-05-31

Send Stone Barrington back 65 years, move him to California, and welcome to the world of Rick Barron.<br /><br />Rick, a beat cop, happens to witness a car accident, and scuttles the drunk movie actor back to his studio with no regard for the person he killed. For that, he's rewarded with a job as the studio's director of security and Stone's lifestyle -- a great job, new car, house and wardrobe, rich important friends, tons of money and all the beautiful women he can eyeball. Then, for some inexplicable reason, he's suddenly a movie producer, producing Hollywood blockbusters. Then, suddenly he's a Navy pilot. and we get rushed through the last 50 pages of Rick's war adventures.<br /><br />I guess Woods knows that his Stone Barrington series is down the toilet, so he decided to deceive readers into thinking he had a new character and storyline in order to get them to buy his latest piece of garbage, when in fact it was the same old, same old. Holly at least was different when she started out, and didn't fall into the trap until she inherited money and met up with Stone in New York. Now Woods can boast of having three lousy series going at the same time.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, particularly if you're a Stone Barrington reader...you've seen it all before.	2005-05-26

So much more time was given to Amy that you expected Tara's short parts to really give insight into the character that would make you realize she's different from how Amy is portraying her. However, not only did that not happen, but Tara's passages made her even more unlikeable to me, so I'm not really sure what the point of them was.<br /><br />Definitely worth adding to your summer reading list.	2005-05-23

With Jane being a NYPD detective, the stories are a lot more plausible and the writing just seems to be on a much higher level.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the series is Jane's relationship with Hack. She comes across as such an intelligent, self-sufficient heroine in the books that it's disappointing to see her acting like a lovesick schoolgirl over a married man. Hopefully, as the series progresses, Hack will become history and Jane will find a real romance.	2005-02-21

With no one to care about or root for, the book seemed to go on for ages, with pages and pages of nothing but filler, and nothing of substance happening.<br /><br />What kind of woman finds out her brain-dead husband has been cheating on her for 12 years, is being investigated by the IRS, gets stonewalled by the family attorney, who happens to be her husband's best friend, and doesn't seek her own legal counsel?

It comes off sounding as if her characters are a bunch of kindergardeners who just learned a new word that their parents told them not to say, so they overuse it to the point of ridiculousness. It's not a speech pattern in a character -- it's every single character in every single book she writes. I'm not sure if it's meant to make her books more \\"mature,\\" or to make her characters sound tough, but it's distracting and makes her dialogue annoying to read.<br /><br />I'm also not sure why she feels the need to fill her books with so many characters. I've finally learned that when reading a Heather Graham novel, it's impossible to keep track of everyone, so I no longer try. And don't even try to figure out why the culprit killed anyone, because he and his reasons get so lost in the shuffle of all the characters and their roles in the story that it'll take you an extra week to try to figure it all out.	2005-02-08

The author beats us over the head with the fact that Charlotte minds her own business and respects peoples' privacy, but the entire story consists of her sticking her nose into places where it doesn't belong -- sneaking in to clean the office of a man she suspects, questioning her client about her personal life, asking a former client questions about her best friend. She does stupid, dangerous things and gets indignant when her police detective niece and ex-cop next door neighbor get angry at her for doing these stupid dangerous things (and then the niece and neighbor always end up being the ones to apologize -- go figure). If Charlotte is going to keep investigating cases, then the author should really tone down on Charlotte's goody-goody persona. She's nosy, she's intrusive, she's overbearing. Let's just call a spade a spade.<br /><br />There's also an inconsistency in this book from the previous installment. At the end of the last book, we found out that Louis was estranged from his son because his son was involved in robbing a liquor store where the owner was killed. In this installment, it's mentioned that Louis was estranged from his son because his son was involved in mugging a tourist who later died. This is the second inconsistency I've found from one book to another in this series, which isn't a very good track record in a series that only three books old.<br /><br />And I'm not sure what's up with all the dramatics in the writing. Charlotte never walks anywhere...she marches, stomps, trudges and plods everywhere she goes. She never smiles...a smile tugs at her lips or plays at her lips or curves the edges of her lips. Every time someone compliments her, or she has an argument with someone, or thinks an unkind thought about someone, her cheeks flame red, anger boils inside her or shame washes over her body. This all seems really overdone for such a benign character in such a benign series, and becomes annoying after awhile.<br /><br />The concept of the series is cute, so hopefully the author can get back on track.her cheeks flame red, anger boils inside her or shame washes over her body.

If you're looking for an in-depth mystery, then it's not for you.<br /><br />The problem I do have with the series is that Charlotte constantly talks about not butting into the personal lives of her clients, and how confidentiality and discretion are so important to her that they're grounds for immediate termination of her employees. Yet she goes right ahead and sticks her nose into things and places where it doesn't belong, such as tracking down BJ at school and sneaking into Sam's bedroom to snoop while supposedly using the bathroom. The author should let up a bit on how goody-goody Charlotte is if she's going to do these things and get herself so involved with her clients.<br /><br />Also, one discrepancy from the first book bothered me. In Book 1, Judith didn't want Charlotte to let the victim's wife know that she's her niece. In this book, when Judith shows up at the house where Charlotte is working to talk to the owner, the owner stares at the two of them and Charlotte comments on how she probably recognized the resemblence between them, since she and Judith are often mistaken for mother and daughter. Shouldn't the wife in Book 1 have noticed this same resemblence if it's so strong, considering she had much more dealings with Judith than the homeowner in Book 2?<br /><br />I look forward to Book 3.	2005-02-01

It works for Bubbles Yablonsky because she also works for her town's newspaper as a reporter. It doesn't work in this new series.<br /><br />The mystery itself wasn't too bad (though it was a bit confusing with all the characters that kept getting tossed in as the story went along), but the characters were awful. The author seemed to be going for the madcap humor of Stephanie Plum, but she fell far short of her goal. Reyn wasn't all that likeable, let alone funny. We found out very little about her in this book, other than the fact that she has three Labs, wears cheap underwear, and has a bad haircut. And Trudy has got to be the most annoying sidekick ever in the history of amateur sleuth series.<br /><br />The editing was also really poor. There were so many spelling and grammatical errors that I lost count of them about halfway through the book. And the cute little pet names for Scythe (Detective Delicious, Policeman Perfect, Lieutenant Lucscious) were just nauseating after awhile.<br /><br />While not as bad as Nancy J. Cohen's \\"Bad Hair Day\\" mysteries, I don't see this hairdressing sleuth staying on my reading list very long.	2005-01-30

However, I did enjoy this one. And that's because the story wasn't overfilled with the annoying sidekicks, Illuminada and Betty.<br /><br />Both characters have outworn themselves in this series, having turned into a couple of unlikeable, stereotypical caricatures. Illuminada, the impatient Cuban, can't get through a paragraph without throwing out a \\"chiquita\\" and looking at her watch. Betty, the controlling African-American, can't get through a paragraph without throwing out a \\"girlfriend\\" and barking out orders. These two got old a long time ago, and the series is just so much more enjoyable when Bel is interacting with Sol, Ma, Sofia, Wendy, her kids and her students.<br /><br />Hopefully the author has realized this and the series will continue in a positive manner, as it did with this installment.	2005-01-26

But I guess this is what happens when an author tries to find a new career for a cozy series and picks one that really has nothing to do with police work, causing their character's involvement to be more and more forced the longer the series goes on.<br /><br />The mystery itself was very easy to figure out, mainly because the culprit's name kept being dropped into paragraphs here and there that somehow tied to a clue that came up a few pages later. If the author was going that route, then she should've spaced these things out better.<br /><br />There were also way too many subplots going on -- the cooking school, the pregnancy, the cat diet...which had to be the stupidest of all, since anyone who owns a pet knows that you change their food by gradually mixing it with the old food, not by changing it abruptly, giving vitamins or cooking boiled liver.<br /><br />Hannah's lovelife has also gotten silly already. Two guys dating the same woman are not going to show up to take her out on a date together. She seems to be casually dating them while deciding which one she likes better, but it seems she's not thinking about who she like more, but rather which one she wants to marry. Can we slow down a bit please and develop a relationship before we start picking out wedding china?<br /><br />The supporting cast are a bunch of buffoons. Andrea isn't able to take a leak without calling Hannah to see if she should pull down her pants before or after she sits down. Lisa seems to have some kind of woman-crush on her. Bill is an officer of the court who encourages Hannah to investigate his cases and stick her nose into police business. The townspeople don't seem to have any faith in the local police since they all encourage Hannah to solve every crime in town, offer her every bit of confidential information and family secret. And even when the other cops do try to discourage her involvement, Hannah thinks nothing of breaking the law in order to keep investigating. Why they don't just change the name of Lake Eden to Hannahville and elect her as mayor, I have no idea.<br /><br />The writing is also completely amateur. Character's names are overused (\\"Hannah walked into her bedroom. Then Hannah put on a sweater. After getting a glass of wine, Hannah sat down on the couch. Hannah then reached over to pet Moishe.\\" Does this author not believe in pronouns?). Every little detail is written out for us (\\"Hannah backed the car down the driveway. Then Hannah backed into the street. Putting the car in gear, Hannah drove forward down the street.\\" I'm glad we were informed that Hannah drove forward down the street or I never would've figured out how she got where she was going!). Go back to basic creative writing school.<br /><br />On page 223, while watching a movie, Hannah says she enjoys watching this type of flick because \\"I watch to pick the plots apart and see how many mistakes I can find.\\" That's what reading a Hannah Swenson novel has turned into. As she says on page 229, \\"the dialog was trite...the plot was nonexistent and the characters were unlikeable....\\" The only difference is that this series is not immensely enjoyable. Rather, it's gone the way of Nancy J. Cohen's \\"Bad Hair Day\\" mysteries -- leaving me wondering if it's true that anybody can get published if they have the right connections.volvement, Hannah thinks nothing of breaking the law in order to keep investigating.

Unfortunately, this series keeps getting worse.<br /><br />There were so many things going on in this book that it was hard to keep track of them all -- a murder in a neighbor's home, an incident between neighbors, animal cruelty, illegal fur business, exotic bird trade, competing salon owners, baldness, citrus canker, teenage angst, bad deeds from the past. Way too much to keep track of.<br /><br />Marla never learns her lesson and keeps putting herself into stupid, dangerous situations. Her cop boyfriend does nothing to discourage her from involving herself in his cases other than shaking a finger now and then, but yet he turns around and tells her that the case is \\"our case.\\" Cops do *not* encourage civilians to get involved in their investigations, particularly a civilian as stupid and careless as Marla.<br /><br />After she finds out about two hairdressers being killed, Marla thinks she went to school with one and doesn't recognize the name of the other. After she goes to her beauty school and finds out they were all classmates, we suddenly learn that the three, along with two other students, were part of a tight \\"gang\\" who hung around together and basically ruined another student's life. So why doesn't Marla recognize the name of someone she was supposedly so tight with? That really lost me.<br /><br />This author has enough trouble trying to write mystery -- the last thing she should do is try to add romance. There's really no chemistry at all between Marla and Dalton, and her attempts at writing romance for them come off as juvenile and amateur. On one page, Marla is fretting about their differences and how a relationship between them won't work, then on the next page she's discussing the changes she'd make to his decor if she moves in with him. No consistency and certainly nothing about these two that makes you want to read about them having a meal together (which will, of course, be filled with leers and attempts at sexually suggestive comments and feelings) much less living together.<br /><br />This author really needs to go back to writing school, because she's a textbook for \\"How To Get Your Novel Published.\\" There's no red, yellow and blue in Marla's world -- only crimson, lemon and azure. Clothing, table settings, meals, cars, everything is described in painstaking detail to the point where you end up skimming over paragraphs at a time.

If you're looking for information specifically about the Border Collie breed, as I was, don't waste your money. You can get 90% of what was in this book by picking up any book on dogs, and you won't know any more about Border Collies than you did before you read it.	2004-12-29

I hope it's not totally out of left field too or I'll be done with this series, which is definitely not on par with Stephanie Plum.	2004-12-20

It was too pat and convenient, without Desiree having to do any legwork or dig for the truth.

Six books into the series, repeating storylines is not a good thing.<br /><br />While the premise for this series was decent in the beginning, it's already starting to get old and worn down. Skye is such a geek that there's no way on earth a bunch of high school students would trust or confide in her. She runs around town sticking her nose into everyone's business, putting herself in danger, and generally making a nuisance of herself. And yet we're supposed to believe that the police are so incompetent that they ignore her leads and \\"force\\" her into solving crimes on her own?<br /><br />I'm also not sure if the author is now going for romance as well as mystery, but it's just not working. There's no chemistry at all between Skye and Simon, and there's even less between Skye and Wally. Skye's trysts are not sexy in the least, and the author is really damaging the series by continuing to try to push them on us.<br /><br />I realize the setting for these books is small-town midwest America, but can we please try to bring Skye into the 21st century? How many people do you know come out with conversations like, \\"He's not a possible instrument for harm\\" when talking about the safety of a student? Ugh.	2004-11-20

In this series, it seems that the mystery is secondary to the gimmick of Juliet being a stay-at-home mom who really doesn't want to stay at home.<br /><br />While I'm sure this is appealing to other mothers who've been in this same position, it makes for boring reading. I want to read about the mystery...not pages about Juliet scouring her son and his classmates' heads for lice or her son pooping in his pants at a public park. I'm sure these stories were cute to her family and Mommy friends, but to the average reader, they're stupid and take away from the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these kids who are such a focus of the books are spoiled brats and completely unlikeable. At 4 and 2, they had the vocabularies of college professors. At 2 1/2, Isaac was still nursing and demanding that Julet \\"bring me my breasts.\\" All I kept hoping was that the killer would get these two next and spare the rest of the cast. No one was more annoying than them.<br /><br />Since the author has molded this series completely after her own life, and according to her bio she has four kids, I guess we're in for a few more brats and a lot more stories of pooping and spitting up. I don't think I'll stick around to find out about it.	2004-11-18

I don't like when books aren't wrapped up in order to force you to buy the next installment -- I'd buy it regardless of knowing who Wolf really is. I didn't see Sphinx's identity coming...it would've been awesome if he'd turned out to be Wolf.<br /><br />And the Christine stuff...ugh. The woman abandoned her kid, and she can just waltz right in and take him away from the only family he's ever known? Call Alex what you will, but he's definitely a loving father who takes care of his kids and raises them the right way. That part of the book really turned me off.<br /><br />If you want to read an author that's given up effort and is coasting on his name, pick up Stuart Woods' Stone Barrington series. Ugh.	2004-11-14

After the last Stone Barrington novel, I swore I would never read another book in the series again. However, when I saw that he'd teamed Stone up with Holly Barker, I decided to give it a final shot. Big mistake.<br /><br />Holly had always come across as a smart, no-nonsense cop. In this book she came across as just another of Stone's bimbos. She wants to nail some guy for murder, and we're really not sure why she's so hung up on this. She and Stone get kidnapped out of their car and almost killed until, as usual, Stone tosses out a few words of wisdom and stops a professional killer from putting bullets in their heads...after the obligatory sex romp in the cellar with the killer listening in.<br /><br />Stone has been deteriorating for awhile now, but I was really disappointed that Holly was portrayed as a stupid reckless bimbo who never stopped to think through her actions or take appropriate cautions, but rather seemed intent on two things -- killing her perp and getting into Stone's pants.<br /><br />I still wonder how much Elaine is paying to get her name mentioned in every book. And how is it that Dino can eat in this restaurant with Stone and his floozy-of-the-week so often while he has a wife and baby at home?<br /><br />Basically, this is the same garbage Stuart Woods has been churning out for Stone for awhile now, only this week's bimbo was given the name Holly Barker to try to hold onto his dwindling audience. I feel cheated and deceived, and I will never read another thing from this author. I only wish I had the ability to give it negative stars.	2004-10-17

And while less Ruby is a good thing, too much Isaac is a bad thing.<br /><br />Another silly pretense of Juliet sticking her nose into something that doesn't concern her, and people telling her everything she wants to know for absolutely no reason at all. Nothing makes a novel less enjoyable than having no clue at all why the main character is involved or why people are opening up to her.<br /><br />I'll give this series one more shot, but if the annoying brats continue to overshadow the actual story, I'm done with it.	2004-10-16

However, not even Renie and Gertrude could save this one.<br /><br />The \\"surprise twist\\" at the end was lame. But worse was the story itself, with Judith continuing to stick her nose into things that don't concern her and get people to yap her ear off just because \\"she likes people.\\" It's been a lame premise for getting her involved in the mysteries through entire series, but it just came across as completely ridiculous this time.<br /><br />The dialogue is painful to read, the writing has become amateur. Ms. Daheim should put this series to bed and concentrate on the Alpine series, which is still enjoyable.	2004-08-21

It's sad that there a good, talented writers who can't get published while this one continues getting published solely on her name.<br /><br />I'm not sure which is worse -- the shallow cartoon characters that appear in each of CHC's books or her complete and utter lack of writing talent. After six books, Regan has still never been flushed out as a character, other than being a PI and the world's most perfect daughter. It's also gotten exceptionally silly the way CHC has to manipulate things so that all these characters show up in one place to be part of the story, including Regan's mother, \\"the best-selling author.\\" I can only think of one book in this series where her presence has made any kind of sense to the story and wasn't just designed to shove her in there somehow to coo all over her perfect daughter. And the writing just gets worse and worse -- why can't people ever just say things instead of crying, declaring and piping in? Why is so much time spent on every silly little detail, such as what type of pajamas Regan put on when she got to her hotel room or the flavor of Chap-Stick found on the floor? Draw me a picture...don't drown me in words.<br /><br />In the case of this particular book, it was by far the worst of the bunch. It was easy to figure out which couple would be declared the winner since all the attention was on them throughout the book. It was easy to figure out what would happen with the two shows at the end. And it if was designed to be some kind of zany slapstick, CHC fell far short of her goal.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or your money. Stick with Mom.	2004-08-14

There were also a very limited number of characters, which meant that even if you couldn't figure out who the guilty party was from the storyline (which was fairly easy to do), you could pretty much figure it out by process of elimination since there weren't many choices. Most of the main characters didn't come across as particularly likeable or intelligent, which also made it hard to feel for any of them.<br />A decent enough read, but by far not her best work.	2004-06-26

Sure she still does stupid things that put herself and those around her in danger, but there seems to be a little more believability to the things she does. And her transformation from soccer mom to slut isn't beat over your head like it was in the last book.<br />The supporting cast really should be fleshed out a bit more. I'm not wild about Gabe and think that Vance has much more potential as a suitor. Barney has the promise to be a terrific character, a more toned-down version of the over-the-top Grandma Mazur. And even Sam's mother has the potential to be fun.<br />There were still some little things that bugged me in the book, but they were mostly from an editing standpoint. Early in the book, Sam tells us that she keeps pepper spray on her keyring. About three pages later, she gets herself into trouble and reaches for her keyring, \\"where I keep a canister of pepper spray.\\" You just told us that...I can figure out why you're reaching for your keyring. I also found it highly annoying and lazy that throughout the book, the author misspelled \\"Acura\\" as \\"Accura.\\"<br />Looking forward to the next book in the series.	2004-06-20

This book wasn't in the least.<br />Hannah takes it upon herself to investigate a murder in town. She then informs the police of this decision and rather than discouraging her, like real police would, they all giggle about winning their bets, and set up a time to meet with her to go over details of the case. As the story progresses, Hannah storms around town questioning people, demanding answers and spouting off as she sees fit, and not one person tells her to take a hike. She then involves herself in an old bank robbery because she coincidentally gets a bill in her cash register that looks suspicious and the bank president is all too happy to look up the serial number and give her details on why she was right. It gets to the point where all belief must be suspended because everything is so ludicrous.<br />If Hannah isn't annoying and obnoxious enough, the supporting cast is just as bad. Her partner, Lisa, seems like she has a crush on Hannah, babying her, cooking for her, running Hannah's business for her. Norman and Mike are supposed to be the two men she's dating, yet she attends &quot;extended family&quot; events with both of them where she sits between them and holds both of their hands. Andrea is as annoying a character as I've ever seen. None of them make you care about them in the least.<br />And the writing in this book is just awful, with way too much attention paid to every little detail. We get two full pages of Hannah walking upstairs from her car and unlocking her door. We get a full page of her drive to work. And we get pages upon pages of Hannah mixing up cookie dough. Did the author have a word count to fill?<br />I hope the next book in the series is better, or this author will be going the way of Nancy J. Cohen...right out the door.	2004-06-19

That line has been erased. Bennie is portrayed as &quot;one of the girls,&quot; and the associates (whom she annoyingly refers to as &quot;the kids&quot; throughout the book) seem to have taken over the asylum, demanding to know Bennie's financial situation as if it's their right, and standing by their homegirl as one united entity. That's all well and good, but in the real world, single women would be hitting the pavement looking for interviews if they found out their job might not last another two months. The dialog between them seems as if they're in a high school home ec class, filled with silly slang that isn't befitting a group of women professionals. And some of the writing left a lot to be desired -- his change jingled unhappily in his pocket as he ran? Do coins have the ability to be happy or unhappy? Where on earth would Ms. Scottoline come up with drivel like this?<br />The problem with the story is that it's too scattered. Bennie's twin is back playing havoc with her life, but we never really understand why, even after she tells us. She breaks into Bennie's house and kidnaps her dog, who Bennie obviously loves dearly, and all she does the next day is put the dog in the basement as a safeguard? Then there's the &quot;mysterious stranger&quot; who shows up to save the dog and suddenly devotes his life to trailing Bennie to make sure she's safe. Wow. That sure happens every day. Then you have the client to whom Bennie seems to form an unnatural attachment, her law firm's financial troubles, the offer to buy her firm, the trumped-up charges against her -- there was just too much going on, but not enough detail paid to any of these things to make you care much about them.<br />Bennie also came across as stupid in this novel. She's a lawyer, yet she has no problem interfering in a police matter just because she feels like it (because of this unnatural attachment to her client). She gets arrested and doesn't know enough to keep her mouth shut while Carrier represents her. She knows her life could be in danger, yet she takes off on her own looking for a pay phone -- in a construction area. It was just too ridiculous to believe. And then she figures out who the murderer was -- with no clues or hints at all...it just comes to her in the blink of an eye! Maybe she should join the police force.<br />This was a very disappointing effort from a writer I usually enjoy very much.are much about them.<br />Bennie also came across as stupid in this novel.

However, it wasn't quite as good as her usual fare.<br />Helen started out so annoying that I couldn't care less about her. And Stacey was such a wimp where her mother was concerned that I found it nearly impossible to care about her either, especially after she succumbed to going on a tour of a tuna fish factory just because her mother bullied her into it. Grow a spine, woman! I thought the romance with Jack had potential, but it was introduced so early and nothing really happened there either to make me care much about it.<br />The whole thing was very predictable with no twists and turns to surprise you even a little bit.

In this case of this series, it's obvious that's just what this author has done, just by reading the little bio blurb in the back cover. At least try for a little deviation from yourself, whether it be physically, mentally or emotionally.<br />Skye has become increasingly annoying as the series progresses. There's no justifiable reason whatsoever for her sticking her nose into these cases, and even less reason for a police chief to not only allow her to do it, but give her access to confidential information in order to faciliate her \\"assistance.\\" It gets even more ludicrous when her mother, the town police dispatcher, gives her permission to go into the store room to poke through evidence while the chief is out of the office. Shouldn't that be grounds for termination?<br />If Skye's romance with Simon is supposed to be sexy, the author is doing a poor job of portraying that. These are two grown adults, neither is attached, the whole town knows they're dating, and yet they feel they have to sneak around? That no one has figured out they're sleeping together? What is this, junior high school? There's nothing at all appealing about this couple.<br />Add in the silliness of Bunny, Frannie and Justin at the end, and this was almost a painful book to finish. If the author wants to continue this series, then she needs to have her characters grow up and stop acting like a bunch of teenagers trying to form their own \\"in-crowd.\\"	2004-04-23

She sticks them in at least two or three times on nearly every page, into every conversation, to the point that it comes off sounding like a bunch of pre-schoolers who just learned a new word that Mommy and Daddy told them not to say.<br />The storyline was so coincidental that it was unbelievable. Ashley and her friends see a bad accident on their way out of town on vacation, and it just happens to be an old friend lying in the road -- a friend Ashley hasn't seen in years, but who she just knows would never turn to drugs, and fights the police on this point, even though the victim was found with a bodyload of heroin in his system. His parents lie to the hospital personnel to allow this person who hasn't seen their son in years to pose as family, to come and go from his hospital room as she pleases when they're suspicious of his accident. The whole thing was just way too contrived to be believeable.<br />And the \\"romances\\" seemed forced as well. Ashley and Jake had absolutely zero chemistry, and the \\"animosity\\" between them seemed ridiculous for something as silly as Jake startling Ashley and making her spill her coffee on him. The Karen/Len subplot was stupid and out of the blue, and in the end, even the two remaining characters were hastily paired up to give everyone a partner and a happy ending.<br />I'll never understand how Heather Graham has become a \\"New York Times best-selling author,\\" since I've never read anything by her that's been all that good. Her Florida settings and a lack of any other authors I like having new books out are the only reasons I continue to read her.	2004-02-07

Now it's just getting stupid.<br />Lucy has turned into nothing but a whining, complaining buttinsky. The police have told her to keep her nose out of their investigations and so has her husband. Yet she keeps sticking it into things that don't concern her, putting herself in danger, for absolutely no realistic reason at all.<br />Ms. Tilley has been a fixture in this series since the start. I found it highly unbelievable that no one in town was real concerned about obvious con artists showing up and moving in with her, other than Lucy and Rachel. And it was even more unbelievable to me that they didn't try harder to get in to see her or find out what was really going on.<br />This book also seemed too &quot;busy,&quot; with too many stupid little things going on. Way too much time was given to Sara's birthday party, which turned out to be nothing. Lucy's new obsession with exercise and her looks became downright annoying. And I can only assume all the little Toby stuff was leading up to the next book.<br />If the author is starting to run out of ways to believably keep her amateur sleuth involved in cases, perhaps it's time to hang this series up.	2004-01-25

However, I've read several of this author's Bennie Rosato stories before it, and this one left me confused about the character of Mary.<br />In the Rosato books, she's portrayed as a religious, mousy, goody-goody wimp who's afraid of her own shadow. However, in this story she's portrayed as an impulsive, foul-mouthed, pushy broad. Perhaps there's some development over time and one needs to read these books in order to understand it. But I found it very distracting.	2004-01-24

Sadly, the opposite seems to be true.<br />Ms. Cohen still hasn't learned how to write a lick since she began the series. Page after page is taken up with filler that lends nothing to the story. The dialogue between characters is inane, and it's so stilted and unnatural that you can't even stretch your imagination to pretend that people actually talk this way. People discuss things that both parties already know as a means of conveying it to the reader. The language used is unrealistic (\\"my salon is situated in that shopping center\\"), the haphazard Yiddish phrases are annoying and the stupidity of just about everyone in the book leaves you shaking your head (a woman is shot in the middle of a crowded circus and no one notices anything as a dead body sits among them?). Any South Floridian can easily figure out that the story is set in the Plantation/Davie area, so why would Marla act shocked that her brother and sister-in-law \\"came all the way from Boca Raton!\\" to attend her birthday party? Boca is only 1/2 hour away -- it's not like these people travelled from Siberia. Three times we were forced to read detailed descriptions of the feelings in Marla's mouth after taking a bite of food. And there's still no blue, green, yellow or red in Marla's world -- it's all sapphire, jade, sunflower and crimson.<br />As far as the relationship with Vail, it seems the author is shooting for sexual tension and ending up with oversexed, hormonal high school juniors. There's nothing sexy about this relationship, and there's nothing likeable about either character or Vail's daughter.<br />The murderer's identity was easy to figure out -- if you care enough to even try after wading through all the extraneous garbage. After four installments, all this series has proved is that anyone can get published if they have the right connections, whether they have talent or not. With all the good, and even half-good, amateur sleuth series that are out there, save your time and money for one of them. This one's not worth it, and I'm through giving it chances.series that are out there, save your time and money for one of them. This one's not worth it, and I'm through giving it chances.	2004-01-11

When the case was wrapped up and Britt was packing for her trip, there were still enough pages left to know that something was going to happen, but few enough pages to know it was going to be weak. I'm not a fan of this type of plot device because I don't like feeling &quot;forced&quot; to buy someone's next book -- if I like their work I will anyway.<br />Other than that, while not her best, I thought this installment in the Britt Montero series was very good, and I would've given it 4 stars on its own.	2004-01-10

The problem with it is that the author is trying too hard to be Janet Evanovich and trying too hard to make Sam into Stephanie Plum...and moving too fast to make either work.<br />Stephanie's involvement as a bounty hunter makes some warped sense -- she's out of work, desperate, and forces herself upon her cousin in order to make what she believes will be fast money. Sam is a soccer mom who runs a dating service. While I can see her wanting to protect her boys, it didn't make much sense that she'd involve herself in the danger that went along with this case when she had so many people willing to help her. Also, it made no sense at all that this woman who's struggling so bad financially that she had to sell her house and her husband's vintage car and move in with her grandfather would use the money for a boob job and slut wardrobe, rather than putting it away to take care of these boys she's so concerned about.<br />The other problem is that Stephanie and her posse are characters we've gotten to know over time as the series has progressed, which has allowed us to feel for them and \\"pick a side\\" in the Joe/Stephanie/Ranger triangle. In this, the first book of the series, two men are vying for Sam and she ends up having sex with one of them. The whole thing just moves too fast without letting you get to know the characters, so it's hard to really care much about them or who Sam ends up with. And while it took three or four books for Stephanie's exploding cars to get old, it only took about 100 pages for Sam's ruining her clothes (and whining about it) to get old.<br />The author really does have the potential here for a fun series, but she needs to slow down and take her time, rather than trying to force nine installments of Stephanie Plum into one installment of Sam Shaw. Perhaps she could pick up Nancy Bartholomew's \\"Strip\\" series to see how it's done.	2003-12-30

There also seemed to be too many &quot;subplots&quot; going on at the same time, which made it difficult to follow along with the main story.<br />Gail has gone from a feisty, independent attorney to an insecure whining shrew. One wonders if she can go to the bathroom without checking with and getting Anthony's permission first. She whines when she thinks he doesn't want to marry her, then after deciding that maybe it's not a good idea to get married in the Keys without letting her daughter know, she gets upset when he suggests putting the wedding off until he's not in the middle of a case. She's still being manipulated by her daughter, but at the same time, she's breaking promises to her because she can't bear the thought of leaving Anthony's side for even a day. The character is turning into a caricature of who she used to be. And Anthony, ugh...I'm not sure I can think of a more stereotypical character except perhaps Carolina Aguilera-Garcia's Lupe Solano. The Spanish phrases, repeated in English in the next line, are overdone already. I've had enough of this rich, well-heeled Cuban to last me a lifetime. No one is this &quot;perfect.&quot;<br />Hopefully this series will get back on track...though I'm not sure that's possible as long as Gail and Anthony remain together. I'd like to see the author return this series to the &quot;Gail Connor&quot; series that it used to be, rather than the &quot;Gail Connor and Anthony Quintana&quot; series that it's become.	2003-12-07

Her dislike of Colin for not letting her do whatever she wants is getting old. This is a grown woman with three children, not a 10-year-old child. Grow up, Torie.<br />Unfortunately, Torie comes across as so stupid and unlikable in this story that it was hard to really get into it. All I wanted to see was Colin lock her in a cell for good and throw away the key.<br />The worst part is that the supporting cast encourages her idiocy. Even Colin, who is supposed to dislike her constant meddling, allows her to read confidential files and shares confidential information with her, even after she blabs details of the murder that were kept secret to the entire town, in front of the press. Are these people stupid?<br />The other thing that was most annoying was that half of Torie's dialogue seemed to consist of her saying &quot;Oh&quot; in response to people. Did the author need to fill a page count?<br />I hope the next installment is better, or I won't be visiting New Kassel anymore.	2003-12-02

After living in South Florida for 16 years and having witnessed them in action with my own eyes (particularly since Hurricane Andrew), those parts made me really laugh out loud.<br />The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that it was a bit graphic and violent.

We know Illuminada is an impatient Cuban -- can we get through a scene without her looking at her watch and throwing out a &quot;chica&quot; or &quot;Dios mio&quot;? We know Betty is an organized, African-American control freak -- can we get through a scene without her pulling out her Palm Pilot to take notes and throwing out a &quot;girlfriend&quot;? Sol is a laid back Jew...Raoul is a devoted to his wife Cuba...Vic is a macho Italian -- we get it already.<br />This story was just silly. Bel was able to solve the murder because someone had a business flyer...the same flyer she's seen in just about every place she goes during the book. I still have no idea how seeing that flyer for maybe the 9,000th time suddenly allowed her to wrap the whole thing up into one tidy little package.<br />Let's calm down with the characterizations and try to focus on the stories here...not in trying to paint pictures of characters who're becoming unlikable.	2003-11-29

Lime Jell-O mold on the head might be somewhat amusing, but added to a high-speed bookmobile chase, head-shaving and an old teacher in pink leather, it started to cross the line into silly and even ridiculous.<br />The most annoying thing was the constant use of &quot;my laundromat.&quot; We know it's hers...we didn't need to be reminded of it in every sentence.<br />I'll read the next installment, but there's definitely much room for improvement as the series moves along.

There's nothing new there (other than no coincidental appearance by Arrington at the most inopportune time). The rest is what sends the book into the depths of ridiculousness.<br />British intelligence is working to track a serial assassin who's been killing their own, and Carpenter (Stone's latest conquest) is next on the list. No one's been able to get a handle on \\"La Biche\\" for years. Yet within five seconds, Stone has not only managed to easily track down her cellphone number, but to call her and arrange to meet her so he can be her liaison to safety. Yes, I'm sure a serial assassin is going to take an out-of-the-blue call from a hot-shot NY attorney (who's sleeping with her latest target, no less), put all her trust and faith into him, and allow him to take over her affairs and her life.<br />As usual, Stone barks orders and people jump. He demands a meeting with Carpenter and her boss, the head of British Intelligence, and not only do they agree to it, but they agree to every demand Stone makes for the meeting. The assassin goes along with every silly plan he comes up with, and actually considers giving up her life of crime after a few kind words from Stone. He orders around the NYPD and the FBI, tags along with Dino on police investigations and generally makes a nuisance of himself. And to me, the worst part was that Carpenter tells him the story of how this assassin has been tracking her, yet after Stone goes behind her back to ring the assassin up and become her attorney overnight, Carpenter acts like nothing is wrong and continues trying to get him back into her bed.<br />There's nothing real or likable about Stone. He's an arrogant, pompous windbag who acts morally outraged that an assassin is a target of British Intelligence for killing their men and woman, yet he has no qualms whatsoever about breaking the law himself when it suits his purpose. While Dino remains a fun character, the women Stone beds keep getting lamer and lamer. And please, someone tell me...just how is Elaine repaying Stuart Woods for all this free publicity?<br />Finally, how many more times is the author going to put that idiotic self-serving note in the back of his books telling readers what they can and can't write to him about? All that does is make me fire off e-mails to him pointing out all his mistakes. Next is adding him to my address book for chain letters.<br />Save your money...this series started going downhill a long time ago, and it's not getting any better.nce for killing their men and woman, yet he has no qualms whatsoever about breaking the law himself when it suits his purpose.

However, several reviews that said her later works improved made me give it another try with this book. I'm glad I didn't invest any further time or money with her.<br />This book is pure garbage. A man is killed and no one seems to care very much. The houseguests sit around the living room making plans to go out on the town. The victim's brother decides to join them with no thought for his three small children (the victim's step-children) until his neighbor, a woman he's met about five minutes earlier, offers to take care of them. He and his wife then go about their business without a second thought, only remembering to check on the kids when Susan shows up to stick her nose into more business that isn't hers...even when their oldest child goes missing.<br />The local &quot;police person&quot; treats Susan like her deputy, sharing case information and basically allowing her to run the investigation...even going so far as to tell others beforehand that they should answer any questions Susan asks them, whatever they may be.<br />The ending was so confusing that after reading it twice, I still have no idea where half of this stuff came from. And that's one of the biggest problems I had with this author the first time around -- she keeps &quot;secrets,&quot; only throwing out information when she's trying to wrap things up. Susan finds something on the floor that turns out to be a clue...but we don't find out until after the mystery is solved what this item was. She goes to talk to people who're only identified as &quot;the woman Susan went to talk to.&quot; People who've never met her before confide things to her like she's their best friend. It's totally unbelievable.<br />Add all this to the fact that Susan is a totally unlikeable character, and there's nothing redeeming about this book, or this series, at all.	2003-09-13

All she has to do is simply smile, use a compassionate tone of voice, and tell people how much she loves people and BOOM! - they spill their guts to her. Oh, they complain and tell her to butt out and mind her own business, but they spill it all anyway, even when she's following them around town or showing up in their hospital rooms. Why, even airline employees give her passenger manifests over the phone, which everyone knows is just not done.<br />The supporting cast is also starting to wear thin. Renie's antics used to be amusing, but it's gone beyond the point of silly when she's crawling into a kitchen cabinet because all three of her kids have suddenly decided to get married out of the clear blue sky. Even Gertrude seems to have lost her sharp edge.<br />The premise of this series has always been cute, but how many murders can happen at a B&B before word gets out and people stop staying there? Or the B&B Association no longer endorses the property? This series has gone on long enough. With the more enjoyable \\"Alpine\\" series still going strong, perhaps Ms. Daheim should concentrate her efforts on that and just let everyone at Hillside Manor retire in peace.	2003-09-02

She comes across as stuffy, nerdy and silly -- certainly not someone schoolkids can relate to or feel comfortable with. The whole character just seems too forced to me, and her adventures are not at all entertaining. There's way too much minute detail -- what she wears, what she eats, what her phone messages say.<br />This book in particular I found very slow and confusing...like the resolution was something I was supposed to care about but didn't in the least, because I didn't know a whole lot about it.

It was very &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; rather than the murder/suspense novel I thought I was buying. Anne was totally shallow and unlikeable, and even the other Rosato &amp; Associates ladies, who I'd enjoyed before, got on my nerves.<br />And I'm glad to see by reading these reviews that I'm not the only one who got tired of the Mental Notes.

I read them quickly and anxiously awaited 8...mainly because I wanted to see where Stephanie/Ranger went.<br />This was the best Evanovich could do with them? After the buildup, this was an incredible letdown and affected the rest of the book for me. One would think that at least a couple of pages could've been used on this relationship instead of the wham-bam resolution we got. A horrible effort.<br />And to top it off, the series itself is just starting to get redundant and silly. Enough blowing up cars already -- it was funny in the first book, mildly amusing in the second book, and outright annoying in the third book. Enough with Grandma sticking her nose into everything all the time. Enough with thugs on the balcony. Enough with quirky FTAs who evade capture. It'd be really nice, just once, to see something original in these books.<br />With Evanovich's other new series being so awful, I hope she's invested her money wisely...because if she doesn't start improving soon, I'm betting she can kiss much more income from her writing goodbye.	2003-06-21

From the Key West setting, to the annoying habits (fisting and flexing fingers constantly), the the overuse of some words for emphasis (tossing them into inappropriate places to punch up dialogue), I could've sworn that was Graham's work all the way. However, this book at least kept you turning the pages, which Graham's rarely do anymore.<br />Hopefully Ms. Spindler will return to normal with the next book.	2003-05-18

The story just didn't seem to flow smoothly at all. And I didn't see the purpose of the sub-plot with Paolina and Marta.<br />On that subject, it's time to dump Paolina. At first she was an okay distraction, playing on something that the author is obviously fond of (Big Sisters). Now she's turned into a surly, smart-mouthed brat who seems to have no respect for Carlotta and all she's done for her over the years. Why Carlotta didn't belt her across the mouth a few times, I couldn't understand. On the same subject, Roz is also getting old after being an interesting distraction. I don't think the author could make her any freakier in upcoming books, and she's lost some of the spark she used to add to the books. Her attitude is also getting annoying -- she's Carlotta's tenant, and if Carlotta doesn't want murals of Big Macs on her walls or picked-up-in-a-bar one-night stands staying in her house, I find it annoying to have Roz mouthing off to her, telling her it's her life and none of Carlotta's business.<br />I hope Ms. Barnes gets back on track, because Carlotta is one of the few female PIs out there that I actually enjoy.	2003-04-30

This one is no exception.<br />However, I found little things annoying me. Too much legal jargon which wasn't explained for the non-lawyer readers. Too many Spanish phrases that weren't translated -- I speak a bit of Spanish and had to stop reading to think through what was being said; I'd find it more annoying if I didn't speak Spanish at all. And Anthony seems to be nothing but a stereotype -- a wealthy Miami Cuban who's a flashy prince of the city without much substance beneath the gold rings and cufflinks. I'd love to see him do something out of the \\"norm\\" to show another dimension to him.<br />Still an enjoyable read.	2003-04-13

This one was so bad, it's a miracle I finished it.<br />Arch needs to be shipped off to boot camp immediately. He used to be a cute distraction to the stories, now he makes them unreadable. He sneaks out to get a tattoo and when Goldie sees it and questions it, he tells her to \\"back off\\" -- which she does. He demands thousands of dollars in birthday presents and threatens her if he doesn't get them -- so she does. There's not a single redeeming quality left in the little punk, and he needs to be gone.<br />Tom has become a spineless wimp. He allows Arch to abuse his mother, he keeps his mouth shut as Goldy breaks the law and puts herself in danger to stick her nose into things she has no business sticking it into. And he's a cop, for God's sake! I get that he's supposed to be a great guy after \\"The Jerk,\\" but this type of behavior just doesn't cut it. He's become unlikeable.<br />Even Goldy has become unlikeable. Why exactly does she allow all this stuff to happen with Arch? She feels guilty for doing what most of us have to do -- working? Would it somehow be better if she was at an office from 9-5 instead of working from her own house on her own schedule that allows for things like taking Arch and his friends to a school field trip? She's even wimply with her clients, threatening that she won't set up their meals if they don't pay her, and then setting up anyway when they sidestep her. And she still continues to put herself in dangerous situations and get herself hurt. There's nothing at all to like about her anymore.<br />Finally, the book should've been about half the length it actually turned out to be. Pages and pages are spent on things that could've been said in half a page. I don't need detailed descriptions of every ingredient Goldy removes from her side-by-side, of every vegetable she chops, nor of every cup of espresso she downs. I also wonder who told this author it was a good idea to stick her recipes right in the middle of chapters, often breaking up a sentence...I find that highly annoying. And if we're going to get the recipes right there, why do we need detailed descriptions on Goldy's preparations? It's overkill, and I found myself skimming through at least half the book.<br />About the only thing positive I can say is that at least Julian and Marla are still somewhat amusing...but based on the way the rest of this series has been going, I don't expect that to last much longer.<br />It's time to stick a fork in Goldy...she's done.idea to stick her recipes right in the middle of chapters, often breaking up a sentence...I find that highly annoying.

However, there are just some things about it that prevent me from giving it more stars, and unfortunately none of these things have been resolved in this installment.<br />When a murder takes place in town, it seems everyone seeks out the local cookie shop owner to make sure she'll be investigating. The police forbid her to get involved, yet turn around and give her confidential information, which she then proceeds to tell to others. She questions suspects as if she's an official and they immediately spill their guts to her. She even refers to the case as \\"her murder investigation.\\"<br />I also find it annoying that everyone in town seems to whine and snivel at her feet. Her sister can't make a move without getting Hannah's approval and reassurance that she's doing a good job. She orders people around, all the way up to the mayor, and they just do whatever she says. People break the law and totally ignore the police in order to assist Hannah with whatever she needs. It just seems there's got to be a more believable way for an amateur sleuth to work on a case in a novel than by blatantly breaking the law and doing things she shouldn't be able to do since she's not an official.<br />I also can't stand the writing style when it comes to dialogue. Conversations between the characters comes off as stilted and unnatural. And enough already with the constant use of characters' names in every sentence (\\"Hi Hannah.\\" \\"Hi Norman.\\" \\"How are you Hannah?\\" \\"I'm fine Norman, how are you?\\" \\"Good, Hannah.\\") -- I'm quite capable of keeping track of who's talking to who without being reminded of it in every sentence of the conversation.<br />Finally, there's really no need for so many subplots to be going on at once, especially when they're obvious. I knew what the relationship between Alex and Janie was as soon as it was questioned. The same holds true for Paul. The ghost plot did nothing for the story. And I'm still trying to figure out how Hannah could draw the conclusion that her sister was pregnant just because she had a bigger breakfast than usual, especially when she states that she was away at college during Andrea's first pregnancy.<br />The author really does have a nice idea with this series, but she needs to work on these things for me to be able to give the books any higher of a rating.could draw the conclusion that her sister was pregnant just because she had a bigger breakfast than usual, especially when she states that she was away at college during Andrea's first pregnancy.<br />The author really does have a nice idea with this series, but she needs to work on these things for me to be able to give the books any higher of a rating.	2003-03-20

A novel is 300 pages or so. At close to 600 pages, this started to feel like a chore to finish, especially since there was so much I felt could've been condensed or omitted to make it more manageable.<br />It was also hard for me to get into it because I found the character of Bennie so unlikeable. She thinks her client might be the twin she never knew she had, yet she constantly refers to her by her last name? That just didn't sit well with me, nor did the almost condescending way she treated her associates and boyfriend. I also found it unbelievable that someone who was supposed to be so smart and ethical would not only fall for the &quot;you're my twin&quot; bit with no proof, but that she wouldn't walk off the case when she came to know all the horrible things Alice had done. A lot of the events also seemed too contrived and convenient.<br />Ms. Scottoline really should concentrate on paring down her books. That would go a long way to increasing the star rating.	2003-03-19

However, this one just spirals back down.<br />I could figure out no reason for Leigh to be as involved in this case as she was, and to continue her \\"investigation\\" for as long as she did. She didn't know these people, she wasn't involved in any way (other than the remote connection of her father being named to care for the cats in the will), and it made no sense that she would continue to stick her nose into other peoples' business and put herself in danger...and even less sense that they'd allow it by continuing to answer her questions and give her information.<br />Characterization has always been this author's low point, and she's done nothing to improve that. Earlier in the series, I was put off by how quickly Leigh went from seeing Warren as her old college buddy to being in love with him and then seeing them married by the next book. This installment did the same thing with whether or not she was pregnant (after the fourth time she got dizzy, I really didn't care anymore). I read series because I like feeling like I know the characters and watching them go through all the important things in their lives. In this series, everything happens \\"off-camera\\" -- Leigh's falling in love with Warren, their wedding, their house purchase and attempts to have a baby. By the next installment, I figure she'll have three kids already in middle school and Warren will be President of the United States.<br />I was also disturbed by the author's choice to have Leigh keep pestering her best friend's mother, who's confined to an assisted living facility with Alzheimer's. Was this really necessary?<br />Leigh is unlikeable, does stupid things, seems to have no purpose or directions in her life, and there's nothing that makes her stand out or gives her reason to be involved in the cases she is. Warren and Maura dislike her sticking her nose into other peoples' business and discourage her all the time, but neither hesitates to tag along when she interferes or continues to involve herself in things that don't concern her. Why hasn't Maura thrown her ... in jail for interference?<br />Ms. Claire really should work on character development and realism. Perhaps then I might consider reading another one of her books. Until then, I'm done with this series.ther hesitates to tag along when she interferes or continues to involve herself in things that don't concern her.

During the last 1/3, it picked up enough and made me reconsider my earlier decision not to continue with the series -- though even now I'm not sure if I will.<br />I found Casey to be one of the most obnoxious, unlikeable characters I've ever read about. I was not amused by her obsession with sex or the constant descriptions of her 350 pound boss' eating habits. I was not interested in reading about her black roots in every chapter (if they need to be dyed that bad, dye 'em already -- stop talking about it), nor the sexy barely-there clothing she squeezed herself into. I think the author went overboard in trying to paint a picture of a character who was a bit too unreal and who it was nearly impossible to relate to.<br />I also found the mystery thin and predictable. The murderer's idenity, as well as Stoney's \\"mystery woman\\" were both obvious as soon as they were brought up. I also thought the ending bit with the dog came out of nowhere and was a bit too \\"convenient\\" to its ultimate resolution.<br />I may or may not read the next installment...but if I do, it'll be courtesy of my public library or local used book shop.	2003-02-23

But at least in this book we didn't have characters &quot;flexing their fingers&quot; on every page as well.<br />The plot is thin, the murderer transparent, and the book a total waste of time.

I enjoyed the premise and the story, which reminded me of Wendy Corsi Staub.<br />However, my only problem with this book was the predictability. I knew before I was even halfway through the book who the culprit was, mainly because it was the only person in the book that no one suspected at all -- every other character that it could've possibly been fell under someone's suspicion, and that suspicion was discussed with another character, which is almost a sure sign that they're not the one.

Women fall at his feet.

One day Billie shows up to take polo lessons, then suddenly Nick's got his cousin moving in with her, he's in love with her, and they're talking marriage. There was no development of the relationship at all. And since the two characters hopped into bed together so early in the book, there was no buildup -- the rest of the book seemed like filler until the \\"big climax,\\" which was about as predictable as I've ever come across, since it was obvious who the bad guy was the minute I first saw their name appear in the book.<br />The book was also poorly edited -- Nick was referred to as Neil during one paragraph, Billie's son Joel went for two or three pages being called Joey, and the lady who sold Billie her wedding dress was introduced as Emma, then became Ida in the next paragraph.<br />Romance is obviously not this writer's forte, nor is proofing and editing.

There was some laugh-out-loud moments and the writing is very good...but by the time I finished this book, I was getting tired of the whole thing.<br />Food falling out of Daddy Plum's mouth got old by the fourth book. Stephanie's drooling, runny nose, tingling \\"doodah\\" and checking to see if she wet her pants got old by the third book. Her ineptness got old by the second book. And her car being destroyed was old before I even finished the first book.<br />In seven books, you would think this woman would've learned something about the job she's been doing, or that Vinnie or Ranger would've canned her by now instead of letting her continue to go out, put herself and everyone around her in danger, and jeopardize every case that she touches. Even Grandma Mazur is no longer funny. Looking in caskets once is funny. Looking in them six or seven times is just repetitious.<br />The author has many talents as a writer, but character development is not one of them.

As a matter of fact, there's nothing that you can even stretch your imagination to believe. Holly's fiancee is killed on the way to their wedding and she barely sheds a tear. Ham is basically able to show up in a little central Florida town one day and suddenly he's the main marksman for a militia group, making a hit on a VIP, while one of the former leaders of the group is suspected of being a spy because of all the suspicious goings-on that suddenly started happening right around when Ham showed up. Huh?<br />The dialogue also sounds like it was written by a 12-year-old. Characters constantly to refer to each other by name in every sentence, and we're subjected to ridiculously long descriptions of dinner menus and word-for-word phone conversations to get a single point across. And when the author wants us to know something, he inexplicably has the characters telling each other very obvious things -- for example, as Ham is getting ready to make his hit, John is explaining their escape plan and says, &quot;And, of course, you're wearing your disguise.&quot; Ham doesn't know he's wearing a disguise and has to be told? Certainly there had to be a better way for Mr. Woods to let readers know Ham was in disguise than something this inane.<br />And, as I've seen mentioned in other reviews, I found the &quot;Author's Note&quot; at the end of the book offensive, where the author instructs readers on what they may and may not write to him about, and informs them that unless they contact him via e-mail, they will not receive a response because he basically can't be bothered. I'm sure that sounds very warm and welcoming to readers who may not own a computer or know how to operate one.<br />The Stone Barrington series has gone way downhill since it started, and this one seems to be headed in the same direction.

And after reading it, I'm still trying to figure it out since the author really didn't give us too many details or ultimately tell us what happened. So, what was the point of doing it, especially if this was to be the last book of the series?<br />And I didn't like what happened to Kat. I realize the loss was devastating to her, but she came across as stupid and careless in this book, which is not something I'd seen in her in other books in the series. Why would she let herself be bullied into taking a case she didn't want to take with what she'd just been through? And after finding out the case wasn't what it seemed and pulling herself off of it, why would some wheedling from an old friend make her stay on it? With the supporting cast pretty much missing and a totally different Kat showing up, it was a very bitter disappointment for the end of the series.	2002-11-03
US	52063173	R1XFSD29MHA3GA	0553097105	959685156	Romeo	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Predictable	This book was supposed to be suspenseful, but it was only one thing...predictable. I was able to guess Romeo's identity almost from the start, and the attempts at making just about every character we came across a suspect except the one it turned out to be just enhanced my suspicion. I kept reading more to find out if I was right (and hoping I was wrong) than to find out who did it.<br />I also didn't care for the main character at all. While I understand Sarah had problems and trauma in her childhood, she was totally unlikeable -- to the point I began hoping that they'd catch Romeo, but only after he'd done her in.<br />I also found it annoying how the book fluctuated back and forth between tenses.<br />Quite a disappointment that it was so predictable. Had I turned out to be surprised by the ending, I would've definitely given it more stars.	2002-08-28
US	52063173	RXECRJ8XKQ2EJ	0451188969	225364947	Thief of Souls	Books	3	0	0	N	N	So-So	This book has been sitting in my \\"to read\\" pile for years, so I finally got around to picking it up this weekend. I had no idea the book was going to be about a cult, but it was something different, so I kept reading. And while I stayed up late to finish it, it was more to find out how the author was going to get out of this mess, rather than because I cared about the characters.<br />Dan comes across as stupid and silly. OK, we know he loved his wife, but if abandoning him and his daughter to join a cult wasn't bad enough, I would think that stealing everything he has or injuring him physically would be enough to make him stop and realize he was better off without her...not continue to pine away for her like a lovesick puppy. And the relationship with Laura was awkward - she seduces him, he wants to be with her, then suddenly he doesn't and decides to end it, but she comes back from a walk and confides her past to him and he does nothing. It made it very hard to care about him and what happened to him, since he didn't seem to care much himself.<br />The last part of the book seemed unrealistic. Why would Noah so openly accept Dan into his special group when he obviously doesn't trust the man and when Dan attempted to steal his wife back from the cult? Wouldn't he be a bit more untrusting of Dan than to just stick a guard behind him and allow him access to so many confidential things?<br />Sadly, the most interesting character was Felice, and her supporting role was never really developed.<br />I'm definitely not disappointed this book took me so long to get around to reading, because it was really nothing more than a time filler.	2002-08-25

Each installment of this series has gotten worse, to the point they're barely tolerable anymore.<br />The characters are never really fleshed out, and with the connection of Regan and her novel-writing mother, all you can do is picture the Higgins Clark women, since there's nothing to tell you otherwise about them. The writing is also very poor, often seeming very juvenile. And too many supporting characters makes for a very confusing story.<br />The author really needs to work on her writing skills. She's already a step ahead, having the in to get herself published. She should take the time to use that chance to her advantage.	2002-08-04

Once again, this author has presented her political views on Cuba under the guise of a novel.<br />Lupe is an interesting character and the books are well-written. However, they continue to be so overrun with everything Cuban (obviously the author's personal feelings on the subject) that they end up turning intolerable. Couple this with the author's constant need to hit us over the head with Lupe's wealth and background, and the whole concept of the novel gets lost under the trivialities.<br />Pages and pages on Cuban sugar mills is not why I picked up this book. Had I wanted to learn about that, I would've bought a history book. I find it hard to believe that the author can't find anything in such a vibrant city as Miami to write about without drowning the entire story in Cuba. She'd do herself and readers of her books a great service if she could manage to produce one novel that wasn't a history of Cuba and its politics, and that didn't focus on her obvious obsession with the country.	2002-07-31

Judith, who I usually find enjoyable but stuffy, comes off as totally dippy. Gertrude, who's usually the highlight of the series for me, is barely seen.<br />People wander into the cousins' hospital room to spill their guts. Bill breaks his professional ethics as a psychologist to tell them confidential patient information &quot;to get their minds off Joe.&quot; Though the hospital staff doesn't seem to like them very much, particularly Renie, they still give them whatever information they're seeking. The whole thing is just totally unrealistic, in addition to the fact that a story which takes place in the confines of a hospital comes off as stifling.<br />Maybe it's time for this author to choose between this and her &quot;Alpine&quot; series and devote her full time to one or the other, where she can put more effort into the stories.	2002-05-07

I like the old days when Stone was a NY cop with Dino as his partner. Now he's a pompous overbearing snob who's become totally unlikeable. How come he can never work a case for a regular Joe? How come every client who hires him is richer than dirt and gives him full access to yachts, sports cars, private planes and more money than I could spend in a lifetime? This all makes it impossible to relate to the character or the situations he finds himself in.<br />And why is it that no one in these books seems to have a brain except for Stone? Cops and FBI agents defer to whatever he says and basically let him take charge of their investigations and cases (he even tells them what they can and can't do, for God's sake!). Store clerks and hotel employees give out information to him off the street without a clue who he is. Other peoples' employees take orders from him. Friends turn on long-time friends based on Stone's suspicions the first five minutes after meeting him. People don't make a move without checking it out with Stone first, unless, of course, Stone was the one who told them to do it. It's utterly ridiculous.<br />And while I don't have any clue at all what Stone is like physically (I've always pictured him in my mind looking like Tom Cruise, though I believe one book indicated he was a blonde), I find it a bit hard to believe that all these rich, beautiful women fall (and drop their clothes) at his feet within minutes of meeting him. I think this book set a record in that Stone only had sex with one woman (though the other offers were there). People stroll around naked, proposition him, try to get him into bed. It's way too much.<br />And the ending is just horrible. It's not only predictable, but it's played out very lame in all the plotlines (and there were several). This is the first time I've ever read the last page of a book and turned it expecting to find another chapter, because I couldn't believe it had just ended like that.<br />Mr. Woods is one of the few authors on whom I normally will pay full price.

There's next to nothing about him.<br />The book is also confusing and reads more like the author's memoirs. He'll start telling a story, then go off on a tangent into the past (which can last anywhere from two sentences to two pages) and then suddenly he's back at the original thought. It was nearly impossible to follow.<br />I'm a huge Yankee fan and have read lots of books on the team...there are better ones out there. This definitely isn't one of them.	2002-04-12

The way she kept sticking her nose into the investigation and determining what was and wasn't important for the police to know just left me wondering why she hadn't been arrested for withholding evidence, witness tampering, and several other charges.<br />I also wish the author would get out of the annoying habit of having the characters use each others' names in every sentence they say to each other (Hi Hannah. Hi Lisa. How are you Hannah? I'm fine Lisa, how are you? Fine Hannah. That's good Lisa.) This drove me nuts during the first book, and it didn't get any better this go-round. The story isn't hard to follow at all, so this really isn't necessary, and makes for a very distracting read.	2002-04-05

It makes no sense that the victim's families would allow her to dig up something that happened 12 years ago, nor that people ranging from strangers to the police would answer her questions and give her information. It's also ludicrous to think that Jack, a cop/lawyer/husband/father, would not only support her sticking her nose into this thing, but would also advise and assist her, even when it involved taking their young son out on investigations.<br />Too much of the book seemed to be taken up with filler -- questioning sessions that led nowhere (sometimes accomplished in numerous visits), trips that yielded no clues, the obligatory meeting with Sister Joseph to dispense suggestions out of thin air, every small detail of setting up for her son's fourth birthday party. And quite a bit of attention was given to an incident in the beginning of the book involving her son which turned out to have absolutely nothing to do with the case. Three-quarters of the book seemed to just be stuck in there to fill up the word count.<br />If Ms. Harris is going to continue this series, perhaps the time has come to give Chris a reason for being involved in these situations -- making her a cop, detective or PI. As an ex-nun-turned-schoolteacher, each installment seems to be getting further and further out there as to why she's involved in the first place, and it makes for tedius, unrealistic reading which is no longer enjoyable.	2002-04-01

However, with nothing else to read, I decided to give it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised.<br />The storyline is good and it's a nice change from the usual \\"civilian gets involved in yet another murder\\" theme we tend to see in these kinds of mysteries. It was also nice to have some of the characters' history explored.<br />The series still isn't great literature. The writing tends toward the amateur side and I still find the character of Leigh to be somewhat irritating. I also think the author needs to slow down a bit and put some more effort into her characters. I was bugged earlier in this series by how fast Leigh seemed to fall for Warren...and I groaned out loud to find they were already married in this installment. How many people wake up one morning, decide they're in love with their best friend, and are suddenly married to them? This doesn't happen a whole lot in real life, so it makes the characters seem less realistic to move this thing along so fast. Had I been able to see the relationship grow, I might've been able to care about it some more. And while giving Maura a boyfriend was nice, to hint that it was someone that would disturb Leigh and then not introduce him until the last few pages of the book, and have it turn out to be someone that you really had to have read previous installments to understand, was just kind of lame for the way it was being built up.<br />This series and the author both have potential, but I really wish she'd just relax a bit and let the series and the characters develop over time instead of trying to rush the whole thing.	2002-02-08

How can she can just walk up to the police in a strange city that are investigating a murder, ask them what's going on, and receive access to the case and all their information? Why is she the one everyone running the contest and all the contestants come to in order to resolve their problems? Why is she even involved in the first place?<br />The supporting cast continues to grow in number and again it's nearly impossible to keep everyone straight, both because the names are so similar and common and because none of the characters are developed in the least. And the murderer was so obvious that I was honestly shocked at the end to find that it could actually be this person.<br />The character of Heaven becomes more overbearing and obnoxious with each story, without a single redeeming quality to her whatsoever. She's brash, pushy, nosy, annoying and just plain unlikeable.<br />The book is also poorly written. The characters converse constantly about things that they already know in order to convey information to the reader (i.e., when talking to Joe and Chris about her ex-husband Sol, Heaven uses his full name and gives background information on him that anyone who's read previous installments knows the guys already know). And the recipes in the middle of the text are just flat out annoying.<br />I'm done with this series, which is possibly the worst I've ever read.	2002-02-06

In this installment, not only were all the original members of the supporting cast back, but we had a whole new supporting cast to learn as well. Why can't this author at least put an effort into naming her characters in a way that will make them stand out? We've got Sam, Sal, Sol, Stephanie, Bonnie, Bo, Barbara, on and on and on. And since none are developed very well, it's nearly impossible to keep track of who's who, and I eventually gave up caring.<br />What made this book worse than the first in the series was that I couldn't see any reason whatsoever for Heaven to be as involved in this case as she was. Just because she found the body means she now has to stick her nose in and solve the crime? And what's up with Bonnie? This woman is supposed to be a police detective, very good at what she does, yet despite the fact that she warns Heaven and her friends to stay out of it, not only does she turn her head to their involvement (even when it's illegal) and use what information they give her, but she attends their covert neighborhood meetings, where Heaven continues to take charge and push forward with her own private investigation? And she allows Heaven to basically run the show? All this did was make her look totally incompetent as a law enforcement official.<br />I don't know if the character of Heaven is supposed to come across as worldly or charming, but she comes across to me as a lowlife - the former career as a stripper, the disbarment for setting up a drug deal, the five ex-husbands, the boyfriend young enough to be her son. This has done nothing at all to endear me to the character.<br />The writing is also poorly executed. Many of the characters have conversations with each other about things they already know in an effort to convey information to the reader (such as Heaven talking to her friend about why she can no longer practice law). I also find the recipes right in the middle of the story to be distracting and annoying -- the author should take a hint from Diane Mott Davidson or Katherine Hall Page and include an appendix with all her recipes.<br />I've already purchased the next book, so I'll go ahead and read it...but unless there's a drastic improvement both in the characters and the storytelling, this will be my last visit to Kansas City.dy know in an effort to convey information to the reader (such as Heaven talking to her friend about why she can no longer practice law).

Even with the surprise twist at the ending, I truly enjoyed it. However, my only problem with this series is the character of Vida. In the beginning, she was kind of fun in an ornery sort of way. Now she's become such a stuffy, snippy pain in the butt that I'm surprised one of the townfolk hasn't done her in themselves.	2001-12-30

It comes close to being the worst, period.<br />Whitney is totally unlikeable and ruins the story. She's annoying, arrogant, selfish and spoiled, from writing down every cent she gives Doug to the use of the formal &quot;Douglas&quot; whenever she speaks to him (his constant use of &quot;sugar&quot; isn't much better). It seems like every time they turn around, someone is on their tail, no matter where they go or what they do...totally unrealistic. And most of the book consists of them evading capture, rather than doing anything worthwhile.<br />If this had been my first Nora Roberts book, I never would've read another. As it is, the only reason I finished it is because I had no other books in the house.	2001-12-24

Yet when Bel drags her two friends into helping her, they all decide not to tell the former student anything. Huh? They don't even know this person...why would they try to solve his murder if not for Ashley? Why would they care?<br />So much time was wasted on ridiculous conversation between Bel, Betty and Illuminada that it began to feel like I was reading more filler than story. I mean, a whole chapter about Illuminada's &quot;reconcilliation&quot; with her daughter?<br />It just gets worse as it goes on. Bel figures something out out of nowhere, and within a couple of days, she's got some guy flying across the country to meet with her by posing as a recruiter. If I went across the country for a job interview and the recruiter suddenly told me she wasn't really a recruiter and started asking me questions out of the blue about something I'd rather forget, I certainly wouldn't sit there and allow her to tape the conversation...I'd be on the first plane home.<br />But the worst part of all had to be when Bel caught the murderer...by COUGHING ON HIM?!?!? I could not believe what I was reading.<br />Add all this to the fact that so much of the book is a history lesson in the Jewish religion, and you'd be better off taking a nap rather than reading this one.	2001-12-05

This at times caused the book to read more like a botany textbook than a novel.<br />I also found the plot very weak. The first &quot;victim&quot; isn't even introduced to the reader until the last few pages of the book, and the second &quot;victim&quot; seemed to be glossed over.<br />I also didn't understand what the subplots had to do with the story -- Jane's broken leg, the cooking classes, the purchase of a new TV. It's nice to have other little distractions going on when reading a novel such as this, but these things usually tie into the story somehow, which was not the case here. And I found Jane's made-up explanations of how she broke her foot to be really silly...the first time or two it was cute, but after that it was annoying. It seemed like the author tried to use that as a running joke through the book, but it just didn't work.<br />For a series, I also felt the characters I've previously gotten to know were left pretty flat. Jane's youngest son Todd isn't present in this book, and no mention is given as to where he is. Her mother-in-law, who's been present in every other book, isn't even mentioned. And Shelley's husband is never seen, heard or talked about, which leads one to wonder why she's over at Jane's house every single night for dinner and chitchat.<br />I certainly hope the next installment is back on par with her usual work.	2001-11-30

However, this one was so full of politics and history that I skipped over a lot of it, something I rarely do. And her attempt to authenticate it with the Irish dialect was distracting and made it even harder to follow.<br />One thing I wish this author would get a grasp on is the basics of writing. I'm a writer and one of the first things I was taught was that &quot;said&quot; is the best way to describe conversation - it's short, sweet and to the point. This author should be used as an example of what not to do by every writing professor in the world as far as this subject. The characters wailed, breathed, muttered, responded, cried, questioned, murmurered, retorted, and just about every other word you can possibly think of to excess. It was very annoying, as were the pages and pages of &quot;filler&quot; that really said nothing and did nothing to move the story along (i.e. &quot;Where were you?&quot; &quot;What are you, my mother?&quot; &quot;I asked where you were.&quot; &quot;I was out.&quot; &quot;Out where?&quot; &quot;Why are you questioning me?&quot; etc.)<br />Another thing that's very annoying with this author is her overuse of characters. She packs so many into each story that it's nearly impossible to keep track of who's who. And in every scene, the details are painstakingly described, and every character must be accounted for. Frankly, I really don't care who sat next to who at dinner, who rode in whose car to church, what everyone wore to sleep and where each member of the family was while Grandma was cooking breakfast.<br />A very poor effort from a very mediocre author.	2001-11-16

Normally one of my favorite authors and my favorite series, I found this book to be pretty bad. The dialog was shallow (do we need to hear his telephone calls word for word, including details of him identifying himself and leaving word on how to reach him?), the characters even shallower (are there *any* women in this book besides Mary Ann who don't walk around buck naked and throw themselves at Stone?). Even the main characters were pretty unlikeable this time around -- doesn't Stone have anything else to do but boink everyone in sight? Doesn't Dino have a job to do in NY? Why is a mob boss so easy on Stone for dumping his princess daughter? Why isn't Arrington at least grieving for a husband she certainly didn't dislike? Why would Mary Ann invite her sister to dinner knowing the circumstances?...	2001-10-30

However, each time I read one of this author's Lupe Solano books, I find myself asking why.<br />OK, we get that Lupe is Cuban. But why does every book have to revolve so totally around this fact? I don't recall any other mystery series where the main character's background or heritage is so prominently featured in every single story. There are plenty of other aspects to Miami which could be incorporated into these books...every breath Lupe draws, every step she takes, every time she goes to the bathroom, does *not* have to revolve around Cuba, or the history of Cuba, or thoughts of Cuba, for the book to be worth reading. Maybe the author should take a few hints from Edna Buchanan or Barbara Parker, who manage to instill a Cuban flavor in their Miami novels while not making you feel you're having it shoved down your throat with every page you turn.<br />I've been around Cuban &quot;society&quot; for many years, and the author goes overboard with it, making her characters come across as snooty, stuffy and unbearable...and not at all real. The Mercedes, the Hattaras, the Armani suits, the ostentatious house...enough already. Lupe is well-off, we get that. We don't need to be hit over the head with it in every paragraph.<br />I feel that Ms. Aguilera-Garcia uses these books as a springboard for her own political agendas and personal feelings on Cuba and being Cuban. If that's what she wishes to do, that's fine. But these books should be promoted that way, rather than as mysteries. Because in reality, that's all they really are -- a chance for the author to hop up on her Cuban bandwagon and sing a very repetitious tune.	2001-10-20

There was so much silliness -- from the cops who &quot;forgot&quot; to withhold something from the public to the way Brenda finagles her way into a temp job at the law firm to the private eye wannabe ex-boyfriend -- and it just kept getting more ridiculous as it went along.<br />I certainly hope this series improves as it goes along, because it really does have potential.	2001-08-08

What a disappointment.<br />The plot was extremely confusing and uneven. It seemed to flop back and forth between two separate crimes and a totally unrelated situation while attempting to tie all them together...of which the author did a very poor job. And the conclusion was very lame, being we knew nothing about the person and had no reason to care about them. None of the characters were well-developed, including the ones we've met before in previous installments. I finished the book last night, and I'm still trying to put together in my mind all the pieces in this jumbled mess.<br />I do recommend this series, but don't start with this one...and don't worry about skipping it entirely.	2001-07-29

Though I didn't know exactly who the murderer was until the end, I felt that was more because I didn't try too hard to figure it out. Other aspects of the story were blatantly being set up for other purposes and I found myself trying to figure out what those were instead...and on those items, I was never wrong.<br />Still a very nice, easy summer read that only took me a few hours.	2001-06-28

There were quite a number of ways she could've gone to really surprise me, and I felt a bit cheated that she took the one I thought was the most obvious.

She's nosy and annoying, and it's a wonder Tommy hasn't just thrown her in jail already. There's no reason whatsoever for her to be sticking her nose into these murders and putting herself into dangerous situations, and the author's done a terrible job at showing us her motivation for doing so. Instead she's just made her come off as simply meddlesome and stupid.<br />Also, for a series, it's disappointing that the secondary characters haven't been more developed. In the six years the series has spanned, we barely know her best friend Lauren. Jim is just kind of there. And with all they've been through, you'd think by now Stephanie could've been softened just a bit and made a bit more human, instead of continuing to be such an overblown adversary.<br />Ms. O'Kane has good potential for a well-written series, but she really needs to work on character development. Oh, and she needs to cut her use of the word &quot;trot&quot; -- no one &quot;trots&quot; around as much as Molly and her friends and family do.	2001-06-10

Normally I like Ms. Collins' work, but I don't understand where this one was coming from.<br />There was no sense of closure when you finished reading the book. Tons of questions were left flapping in the breeze. If she wanted to leave it open for a sequel, that's fine...but it was left *too* open-ended, which just left me wondering why I'd invested two days in reading this book, rather than anticipating the next installment. Did Ms. Collins have an appointment or something? Because she sure seemed to rush into her ending without resolving anything.<br />I also don't understand how the two stories fit together. The first 2/3 of the book was spent alternating back and forth between Madison and Rosarita's stories. However, in the end, I couldn't find anything to tie the two together, other than the fact that they all happened to be out in Vegas for the same prizefight. If the two stories were going to be kept separate with only the tiniest of ties (i.e. Dexter being the jogger Madison sees whenever she walks her dog, Rosarita sitting across the aisle from Jamie on the plane to Vegas), then I'm not sure why Ms. Collins didn't just write two separate novels.<br />I do hope there's another one so that maybe we can find out what was really going on in this one...but I'm not holding my breath.	2001-06-05

What a let down.<br />Molly came off as nothing more than an annoying buttinsky who had no reason at all to be involved in this investigation. Why would she stick her neck out, and risk her family, for someone she hates? Why would she put her children in danger? Why would she keep pushing herself into the investigation when the police and her husband told her to back off? Why did the police allow her to keep interfering, even after they told her to back off? A grown woman can't think of a better way to get information than to attempt to pose as a teenager? If she went to the high school posing as a college student from across the country, why would it matter if she didn't speak the same lingo as the high school kids?<br />Aside from the fact that the murdered man's wife was her arch-enemy in school, she had no tie to the whole thing...so added to the fact that she and the wife still don't like each other, and the man's wife treats her like dirt, it was ridiculous that she'd get herself this deeply involved and put so much at risk. And the ways she went about it were completely ludicrous. I certainly hope the rest of this series is better because Ms. O'Kane is batting about .500 right now.	2001-06-02

And when it was revealed that the murderer was the most obvious choice of all the people Skye suspected, I felt like I'd wasted my time. I also was bothered by the fact the author kept hinting at some secret in Skye's past that was the catalyst for her returning home, but we never got any details about it.<br />I certainly hope the next story in the series is told better.	2001-04-13

I was mistaken.<br />The book really wasn't that suspenseful, and I was disappointed to find that due to the poor construction of the story, I'd managed to figure out whodunnit it extremely early in my reading, and never even wavered from it to suspect anyone else.<br />While I didn't mind the main characters (though I didn't exactly like them), I really didn't like any of the numerous secondary characters, most especially Jennifer. Even though she wasn't a very major part of this book, as soon as I started reading, everything I hated about her in the first book of the trilogy came flooding back so that I cringed each time I read her name.<br />The main problem I have with this author is that the dialogue between characters seems very forced and contrived...and ends up sounding very unnatural. I also find myself bothered by her constant use of the words &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;damn,&quot; which she seems to toss in wherever she can get away with it, whether it's appropriate or not, in order to punch up the writing and make it more...I don't know...dramatic, maybe.<br />I don't like to leave things unfinished, so I'll most likely pick up a copy of the next one at the library or a used bookstore.

However, there are some things that make it somewhat tedious and annoying.<br />For some reason, the author felt compelled to overuse the character's names, both in their individual scenes (Hannah went into the bedroom to change her clothes. Ten minutes later, Hannah went and sat on the couch. Hannah then reached over to pet the cat) and in dialogue (&quot;What's up, Hannah?&quot; &quot;I need to talk to you, Bill.&quot; &quot;Okay, Hannah, what is it?&quot; &quot;Well, Bill, it's like this...&quot; This wasn't a very difficult book to follow along, so I found this constant use of the character's names to be very distracting, to the point of annoyance.<br />I also don't understand where Ms. Fluke is going with Bill, the brother-in-law. The book indicates he's a good cop who asked Hannah to help him solve the crime to make detective...yet he couldn't seem to make a move without checking it with Hannah first or asking her what he should do next. In most stories of this type, the officials usually discourage civilian involvement, but in this case, not only was it being encouraged, the civilian was made to look more competent than the official.<br />Hopefully these little things will improve as the author goes along, and I look forward to reading the next book in the series.	2001-04-01

It would've made more sense to me if Shelley had been the one planning the wedding, since she's always been presented as the &quot;take-charge&quot; part of the team in all the previous books, and Jane had gone along to assist her. The whole thing being set up as it was just seemed odd to me, and not at all in character for the Jane and Shelley I've come to know through reading this series.<br />All in all, I still recommend this series highly. This latest installment wasn't bad...it just wasn't up to the par I'm used to with Ms. Churchill.	2001-03-27

However, the book turned out to be a letdown.<br />I was disappointed to find that Faith was the same shallow, self-centered snob she always comes across as...only it was ten times more annoying without the usual cast of characters (particularly Pix) and the small-town New England setting to even things out. And it was even worse with the book being set in New York City, and Faith's intermingling with the &quot;upper crust.&quot;  The rich society cliches and constant use of expensive brand names and designers was way overdone. The author seemed to put so much emphasis on Faith up on a pedestal (she'd always been the dumper rather than the dumpee, there were plenty of men who'd drop everything for a call from her) that after awhile she stopped seeming real and stopped being likeable.<br />I also found the story not up to par from this author, whose work I usually enjoy greatly. Certain branches of the storyline were never resolved. Did Todd ever manage to track her down? Why did Harvey tell his mother to make her leave? Did she ever hear from Richard again? What was the connection between Lucy and Adrian? Why did Phelps want to borrow money from Hope? And, being that this was a prequel, I seriously doubt we'll ever go back 20 years again to find out. Since the author included a present-day epilogue, it seemed that some of those minor loose ends could and should have been wrapped up for those who read the series regularly.<br />The main plot wasn't too bad, but by the end of the book I'd already figured out whodunnit, which doesn't usually happen in this series. We were never told how Faith figured it out and what made her realize who it was, so I was left wondering where her conclusions came from...certainly not the same place as mine (one paragraph that seemed out of place and unnecessary, and made it obvious the author was trying to work in justification for her conclusion).<br />I'll look forward to the next adventure of Faith, and the knowledge that as trifling as I find her at times, Tom, the kids, and especially Pix, will be back to make for a very enjoyable read.orward to the next adventure of Faith, and the knowledge that as trifling as I find her at times, Tom, the kids, and especially Pix, will be back to make for a very enjoyable read.	2001-03-23

The way she went about setting out to prove the person's guilt was extremely contrived, and the ending much too convenient and uneventful for this type of book.<br />I also didn't understand why the reader seemed to be getting teased with other potential subplots that led absolutely nowhere. Desiree's desire to see all she could of the opulent Manhattan residences she was visiting, Jackie's food poisoning, Pat's birthday party and Ellen's trip to the bridal shop in New Jersey served no purpose to the story whatsoever, and seemed like they just occurred to fill pages.<br />An utter disappointment from a usually stellar author.

How does one know whether an answering machine is happy or sad?). The series itself does have potential, so I really wish Ms. Claire would take a few writing classes and turn these books into something more enjoyable and less distracting.	2001-03-18

The book held my attention, and was the typical mystery I love. However, I was quite distracted by the amateur writing style. Since this is the author's first book, I'm willing to give her more time and have already purchased the other books in the series, but I do hope that as I continue to follow Leigh in her travels, the author's writing style improves.	2001-03-17

The only bad thing I can say about it is that it's written in the present tense (Rory shrugs her shoulders), which can be a bit distracting.<br />I admit that about a third of the way into the book I was sure I had figured out who the killer was, but I kept reading...and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I couldn't have been more off base. A definite must-read.	2001-02-05

Supposedly, they were meant to be tied to each other, but I'm still trying to figure out how they actually were. I also found it very distracting that the book was written in the present tense.<br />The series has potential but needs to be tightened up overall so that the reader is less confused when they finish the book, not more.	2001-01-29

There was way too much space wasted on every minute detail of what the characters were doing or wearing, their gestures and movements. Colors were listed by shade rather than name (she wore a daffodil sweater, crimson shorts and applied putty eye shadow to her lids), awkward wording was used to &quot;punch up&quot; what was being expressed (&quot;The woman expired in my salon!&quot; when most people would say &quot;The woman died in my salon!&quot;). I also didn't need to have what Marla was feeling in her mouth and throat described to me each time she took a bite of food (the yogurt slid down her throat, cool and slick). While I'm sure the author did these things to give the story a more visual feel, I only found it so distracting that at times I could barely concentrate on the story itself.<br />I'll read the next book in the series...but I certainly hope it's written better than this one.	2001-01-12

It had nothing to do with her, and very little to do with anyone she was associated with -- certainly not enough to warrant the extent of her involvement. And even more difficult to comprehend was her annoyance with others, especially her boyfriend and best friend, when they tried to get her to back off something that had nothing to do with her and kept putting her in danger.<br />I hope the next book in the series is better.	2000-12-15
US	52063173	R15MVHGP1CNRZM	0312971370	277858790	Soap Opera	Books	1	3	4	N	N	Go Back To TV	I think it's very sad that so many aspiring novelists go unpublished, while someone who obviously lacks writing talent is able to get something published based on the fact that they're a &quot;name&quot;. While the storyline had some potential, this was probably the most poorly written book I've ever read in my life.<br />The author's constant use of exclamation points was very amateur. The dialogue between characters was contrived and asinine. The characters themselves were completely undeveloped, with only the slightest description of them physically. I was uanble to form a picture of *any* of these characters in my mind, as I usually am when reading a novel.<br />As I said, the storyline had some potential...had it been better developed. I mean, what 18 year old from &quot;the midwest&quot; (since when is Virginia in the midwest?) gets a couple of hundred bucks from her widowed father, hops on a plane to NYC, checks into her conveniently-arranged Village sublet and within weeks is suddenly the star of a television soap opera? What widowed father readily hands over money to his wimpy teenage daughter (and yes, this character is a wimp) and sends her off alone to NYC to break into show business? Why does Jade take such an instant dislike to Amanda? Why does Monique treat her like a daughter? Why does a guy who fights with her on the plane trip to NYC fall in love with her almost immediately the day he meets up with her at the show? Why has her ex-fiancee stayed around for months while she makes her decision? These are just a few of the things the author really should've developed if she wanted to put out an even halfway decent novel.	2000-11-06

US	52063173	RMAM4RY9DW363	0449146855	587712893	Fortieth Birthday Body	Books	1	5	8	N	N	Disappointing	The second in a series, I found this book, and its predecessor, to be extremely disappointing.<br />I'm not sure why these books are called the &quot;Susan Henshaw mysteries&quot;, when her friend Kathleen is the main  character. I also don't understand how Kathleen went from being a state  police officer who detested the wealthy suburban lifestyle in the first  book to &quot;one of the gang&quot; in the second book -- the details  behind this major character shift were revealed in no more than three  obscure sentences.<br />And that's the problem with this series. Crucial plot  events happen &quot;off-screen&quot;, and we find out about them whenever  the plot happens to demand that we should know them. Character viewpoint  changes randomly with no rhyme or reason, from chapter to chapter, chapter  section to chapter section, or paragraph to paragraph. Minor characters are  never identified by name, but rather as &quot;the woman on the other end of  the phone said...&quot;. Semi-major characters are also referred to in the  same way until it suits the author's purpose to have us know who's speaking  or phoning or arriving. The characters also spend a great deal of time in  dialogue about details that are obviously known to them, and whose sole  purpose is to obviously provide us with information the author was unable  to find any other way to provide.<br />The reason I like series mysteries is  the opportunity to gain a familiarity with a core group of characters.  Aside from her immediate family and Kathleen, only the next door neighbors  can be found in both books as minor characters. As the first book of the  series stressed the closeness of the community and the &quot;group&quot;  that Susan belongs to, I found it hard to buy that her husband would throw  her a surprise birthday party, and aside from the next door neighbors, not  a single character from this close group was present. More of my time was  spent trying to learn all these new characters (of which there were many)  than in being able to concentrate on the plot.<br />Usually a great fan of  amateur female sleuth series, this is the first series I've found that I  won't complete. A totally disappointing experience.here were many)  than in being able to concentrate on the plot.<br />Usually a great fan of  amateur female sleuth series, this is the first series I've found that I  won't complete.
