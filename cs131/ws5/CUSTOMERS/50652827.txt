But there was more to it than that. These are not just the good stories of a novelist who needed to make a few bucks in his starving artist days or wanted to be included in a collection. I think that horror fans should consider this collection the current decade's answer to Clive Barker's wonderful collections (Books of Blood, In the Flesh, Inhuman Condition) a generation back. These stories do not just entertain, they blow the reader's mind and expand into territories of transgressive imagination previously unmapped. They also have a great sense of twisted humor. Kind of a mix of Fellini (in his Satyricon mode) and Monty Python. I always thought that horror and humor were natural allies. Both involve surprise, loss of control, exaggeration to the point of the grotesque and a sense of an environment in which something is out of whack or unnatural. These tales, written at various stages of Mr. Little's career, run the spectrum of human and cosmic absurdity and weirdness. In \\"Roommates\\" a man in need of a roommate to share his apartment expenses puts an advert on a bulliten board and is instantly besieged by all manner of freaks and undesirables just clamoring to move right in and bring their delusions, violence, filth, wall-sized board games, pet monkeys and general creepiness with them. In \\"The Washingtonians\\" a man discovers that not only was George Washington his century's real life Hannibal Lecter crossed with Pol Pot (he wanted to found a nation based on cannibalism and dark occult practices, killed and ate Thomas Jefferson, and the story of his cutting down the cherry tree is an allegory for of his habit of sacrificing virgins), but that he is worshipped by a cult of equally crazy modern day elitists with a secret headquarters beneath Mount Vernon who wear powdered wigs and ivory dentures during their rituals. Yes, someone really wrote such a story! Even stranger is \\"Pillow Talk\\" in which the protaginist is menaced by talking sex-obsessed pillows who would probably feel right at home with the talking (and very bossy!) bowl of macaroni and cheese in \\"Blood.\\" These are just a few of my favorites.

Weldon could easily teach Seinfeld and Tarantino a thing or two about gritty, realistic dialogue and making the trivial fascinating.  Annette seems like such a real person that I could scarcely put the book down and read it in about two days.  Spicer's pseudo-Jungian New Age obsessions were also so hillarious that I had to keep reading just to see how irrational,deluded and self-obsessed he could become.	2002-02-05

While the values of logic and modernism ultimately triumph with the exposure of the hound as a hoax, Doyle's tense, apmoshperic writing conjures up quite a bit of genuine horror.

A true visionary like Blake.  *Howl and Other Poems* is his best work--his equivalent of the *Songs of Innocence and Experience*  More than just a poet, of course, he is also a mystic and prophet.  He sees the truth behind the surface.  The beauty behind the pain of America's idealistic outcasts of his generation as they go &quot;mad&quot; from having seen to much and hoped for too much and pushed things too far.  The ugliness and desparation that hide behind the nice orderly facade of everyday life.  Ginsberg's poetry can express the most absolute dispair (the &quot;Moloch&quot; section of &quot;Howl&quot; still feels like a close brush with death even though I've read it hundreds of times), but he can also express such amzaing spiritual joy.  In this regard he is more like the Sufi poets than anything Western.  This sense of the divine within all things and all experience.  The &quot;Holy! Holy! Holy!&quot; litany in the footnote to &quot;Howl&quot; ; the love song to Love itself in &quot;Song.&quot;  This little collection expresses more in less than 100 pages than is imaginable unless you have experienced it first hand.	2001-03-26

It is small, but has a thriving business district and a rich cultural life.  It has traditionalist elements, but is essentially tolerant and open-minded.  Unlike most places in contemporary America, its people have a serious commitment to preserving the surrounding environment.   Then comes The Store--a ruthless super-store corporation obviously inspired by such entities as Target, Walmart, Costco, etc.  Corrupt town council officials allow The Store to illegally take over protected wilderness land to build their enormous fortress-like complex.  They open for business and purposely sell at a loss in order to drive local businesses under.  They provide all goods and services, including a supermarket and a bar.  Soon, their complex has completely dominated the local economy.  Even illegal economic activity like prostitution and drug trafficing take place within hidden compartments.  Downtown is reduced to a a shambles populated by homeless people and there is little employment available for those who are rejected by The Store's harsh employment policies (constant survailace of all employee activities is required; membership in a scary &quot;motivational&quot; cult is mandatory; friendships with non-employees are banned, etc.).  As the only real source of capital, The Store is in a position to control local politics.  As the plot unfolds, we find that The Store has taken over most of the American countryside and is about to infiltrate the cities.  While not as realistic as some fans claim (it IS after all and over the top satire, not a documentary), Little's novel often feels pretty authentic and leads the reader to question the economic power and cultural influence of large chain businesses.  Free market mantras won't easily dispell the feeling of dread you get from reading The Store.	2001-03-22

Enter the mind of the delightfully warped Patricia Highsmith who lets us cheer for the villians and sets her tales of danger and moral decay in luxurious European settings worthy of Ian Flemming.  The Ripley books are much better than the recent film, because they are more brutally honest about Ripley's charater.  Not being written for the typical middle-American audience, there is no need to sugarcoat anything.  He is not some nice but troubled boy who lashes out in anger and then skillfully covers his crime and happens to get rich in the process thanks to a stroke of luck.  He is a master manipulator who is always in control of himself and usually in control of others.	2001-03-22

Koontz tries his hand at the spy and detective genres in this wild, twisting yarn about a detective who takes a job for a sleazy Senator and blunders into Things Better Left Alone.  While its no *Manchurian Candidate,* its quite a bit better than average paperback paranoia stimulator; featuring a scary top-secret research foundation dealing in government corruption, mind control drugs other nasty things.  It was the Soviets in the original version, but since he updated the plot for the 90s, he had to make it a former KGB project turned private project with lots of political and financial clout worldwide.   I'd give the story itself 3 stars, but the excellent writing and realistic international settings push it well into the 4-star range.	2001-03-12

Adam 2 (or &quot;Proteus&quot; as he wishes to be called, after the shapeshifting Greek god) follows the lead of the original Adam and rebels against his creator (humans) seeking illicit power and knowlege.  His quest to escape the boundaries of human control leads to an elaborate scheme involving the genetic engineering of special &quot;vehicle&quot; bodies for his consciousness, who will eventually rule the world.  Though hostile to humans, Proteus assures us that his reign will be benevolent, orderly, prosperous and disease-free.  Left to our own resources civilization is bound to fall apart.  As the &quot;mother&quot; of these bodies, he chooses Susan--the ex-wife of one of his creators.  Easily taking control of her highly computerized futuristic home (she is also somewhat of a reculse so no one will miss her for a while), the sickening experiments begin.  *Demon Seed* works very well as a science fiction thriller, and even better as a satire of prevailing attitudes.  Proteus not really the villian.  He is just a damaged piece of machinery.  What is really scary when you think about it is the motives of his creators; the type of people who would want to make a self-aware mind only to enslave it.  While he considers himself super-human, Proteus is really a distorted reflection of the handful of sexually repressed male technocrats who designed him.	2001-03-12

Everyone he meets has a hidden agenda or secret identity or both.  Tunnels and bunkers stuffed with bombs and lie hidden under ordinary streets.

The Dragon is revealed as a brilliant but socially isolated individual with facial deformities and a history of sickening abuse.  Its easy to understand why he hates the world and wants to opt out of humanity.  Graham, too, is compelling.  He also has a history of severe trauma and a nearly paranormal ability to understand the minds of serial killers.  The two fascinating characters collide with tremendous momentum as the plot unfolds.  Both are also manipulated from behind the scenes by the arch-psychopath, Lecter:  Harris' most famous character who appears in two other books and was later given immortality by Anthony Hopkins.  As far as thrillers go, this book really has no flaws.  Unlike most popular writers, Harris spends years researching his topics (in this case serial killers, severe mental illness and criminal profiling).  Though he understandably exaggerates for the sake of effect, there is a disturbing core of truth behind the flashy Hollywood-friendly surface and the characters (even the 'bad' guys) seem like real people with understandable motivations.	2001-02-21

Most of Dostoevsky's novels are long epics with hundreds of characters and very complex plots.  *Notes ...* is the exact opposite.  It is hardly novel length and little happens except a lot of cleverly misanthropic ranting by the mentally disturbed but witty and engaging protagonist who seeks a kind of freedom in failure and absurdity.  Read it on a rainy afternoon, if you like that sort of thing.  Put in on the shelf between Camus and Sartre.	2001-02-03

New York is treated as the microcosm of 80s America with all of its fads, rivalries, economic woes and class inequality mixing together uneasily and then exploding.  Sherman McCoy, the supremely irritating central charater, is a fresh-faced adolescent of 38 years who just doesn't get the fact that the world is a harsh, dangerous place--that is until he becomes the fall guy in a politically and racially charged scandal.  Peter Fallow (by far the best character in the book)is a delightfully cynical and misanthropic British journalist who observes the parade the do-gooder activists, slick political manipulators, confused cops, thuggish cops, skeletal society ladies, urban punks, garish architecture, trash culture and trendy clubs with an acid wit and always a few stiff drinks under his belt.   If they ever make a real movie out of this book (the existing one doesn't count) PLEASE get Jeremy Irons to play Fallow. Some people see this book as some kind of right-wing propaganda.  It isn't.  Wolfe, despite his own more or less conservative views, allows the story to tell itself without a lot of interpretation from above.  Each character is a complex individual with his or her own unique motivations and mixture of vice and virtue.  We spend time inside the minds and private lives of a wide variety of people and are allowed to make our own judgements about who deserves what measure of praise or blame.  If there is any prejudice in the book it is against people who simplify complex issues.  Wolfe's world, like the real thing, is brimming with paradox.	2001-01-23

Well, if you're read the brilliant cyberpunk classic *Neuromancer*, you know the plot, more or less.  *Empire ...* is part tribute to, part parody of Gibson's work.  But let's say we were living in an alternative reality in which Gibson lost his only manuscript of *Neuromancer* before he could get it to the publisher, and who should find it but the crazy, mystical, beatnick author William Burroughs.  Burroughs then says 'wow, this is quite a story, but I've got a better take on it,' drops some acid and gets right to work.  Lets say, then has the worst bad trip of his of while writing.  The result would look somethink life Acker's ultra-violent topsy-turvey future world in which France is a colony of Algeria, wars are fought with sound waves and burned out, amoral adventurers stride through the techno-babble wasteland of a doomed civilization in search of money, drugs, revenge and just to escape boredom.	2001-01-01

Modern consciouness is self-centered and subjective--we percieve a private &quot;world&quot; within ourselves and are able to distinguish the self from society and ideas from concrete reality.  Drawing on ancient texts and his knowledge of psychology and neurology, Jaynes speculates that at one time humans were very different.  Their sense of self was more loose and dreamlike.  There was little or no sense of self beyond the hivelike group and its myths which were percieved not as stories but as living realities. Gods regularly appeard in dreams and trances to order them around and kings were indistinguishable from gods.  In other words, what we would think of as a bunch of psychotic cultists was pretty much the norm.  Even if he is going a little too far, he makes a strong case for his theory.  If we were to take writings from the period he labels &quot;bicameral&quot; at face value, we find an astonishing lack of modern-style motivations.  Letters and histories are written in a kind of dreamy monotone without reference to personality, desire, choice and other inner realities we take for granted (and demand as explanations for human behavior).  Then suddenly (about 3000 years ago) there is a sudden flowering of subjectivity and ego.  People question the existence of the gods (or at least comment on their relative silence and distance); kings are overthrown, personal wealth becomes a conspicuous goal in many societies; a sense of humor develops.  Jaynes argues that a series of natural disasters coupled with the incresed complexity of civilized life basicly shocked the nations of hypnotized, god-dominated sleepwalkers into what we call normal consciouness (which was far from normal for them).  A complex inner world became the cognitive map of an even more complex outer world.  A constant bombardment ofnovel stimuli required an incresed emphasis on focus and critical judgment as opposed to the earlier lifstyles which were more like an extended tribal ritual.  Waking consciouness and personal self were not natural but learned responses; which is perhaps why they have been the source of so much pain and confusion.    Whether correct or not (I don't think anyone is qualified to say at this point) Jaynes deserves respect and his ideas demand serious research rather than the mockery and dismissal they have recieved from many.  He is not advocating some kind of occult doctrine or proposing that the gods literally existed.  Far from it.  He seems to be as much of a strict atheistic materialist as anyone in modern science (more so than most).	2000-12-22

He understands how to communicate the breakdown of rationality.  If you have read Kafka, you probably know what I am talking about.  His stories take place in a bleak post-industrial zone of decaying cities, drifting artistic failures and dark mystics playing with the soul-searing secrets of an unfriendly cosmos.  In a King or Koontz story, you may be chased by a horrible monster.  But you still retain your identity and place in linear space-time.  Not so with Ligotti's world.  He submerges his doomed characters in a void where everything becomes menacing and lawless.  One of his stories describes a sect who once believed that everything was filled with a divine essence.  Exploring the matter deeper, however, they discovered that the reverse was true.  The entire universe was filled with a hostile decaying essence and the only hope for happiness is ignorance.  People tried to find out the ultimate truth, discovered to late that it was unspeakably horrible and then could not forget what they had learned.  Pieces of an idol representing the foul nature of existence were scattered like the body of Osiris to the ends of the earth so as to hide the truth from the innocent.  Another story concerns enchanting music played by mysterious performers in an abondoned building on nights when the moon is full.  Anyone who hears the music is found mutilated and wrapped in a web-like bandages the next morning.  We are never told why this happens, but it communicates a feeling of dread--humans are being preyed upon by incomprehensible forces. A small town is dominated by a creepy clown-like cult that are anything but funny.  A grown man is driven near madness by memories of a disturbing carnival sideshow attended in his boyhood. These stories are for you if you like to be challenged to take a look at the world from a radical new perspective.  Philosophical pessimists will them for their bleakness, poets for their haunting use of language and vague but emotionally charged descriptions.  People just looking for something different will not be disappointed.   This book was out of print for a while but, thankfully, it is available again.  Buy it while you can.	2000-12-09

We all have our tastes.  However, most of your really extreme condemnations of the book are done out of shocking ignorance of what literature is about.  Since the book portrays murder, these critical masterminds assume, it must support murder.  What brilliance!  I suppose they think Orwell was an advocate of the totalitarian state and Dante an apologist for eternal damnation.  There is no way that a sane person would envy the grotesque and pathetic Bateman for anything but his money.  *American Psycho* is a literary study of a monster, and the culture which helped produce him. It presents a man who lacks humanity and expresses his hostility and alienation through greed, arrogance, exploitation and murder.  Of course, only that last one is disapproved of by his society--80s Wall Street yuppiedom. Actually Bateman just takes the logic popular anti-humanism to its logical conclusion.  Only money and property matter so what's wrong with killing mere people (or at least the ones that the prevailing ideology tell you are useless)?  Its not like he would ever dream of scratching the paint on a BMW or letting a bloodstain linger on his precious designer suits.  I've met people like Bateman who blandly chat about trendy name brands and then throw in a little opinion about how the homeless should be allowed to die off, troublesome countries should be nuked and public services should be stripped down to Third World levels.  Are they really serial killers?  Probably not, but who knows.	2000-12-09

Varndoe's book is the perfect antidote to the complaints of all the reactionary modern art bashers out there who accuse the moderns of lack of talent, pretentiosness or even a nihilistic hatred of reality.  *A Fine Disregard* proves the opposite case.  The moderns were motivated by the highest artistic impuses, were very talented and (best of all) were free spirits not beholden to static tradition and not afraid to experiment.  Yes, some of the experiments failed, but is that not the case in science as well? What is important is that the moderns were imaginative, vigourous and playful in ways that no one had been before them.  Rather than acting as passive human cameras, they willfuly exaggerated the colors and shapes of their subject matter in order to express their emotions and tell us which attributes they saw as most important. An artist who saw color as most important might reduce a meadow to a swirling field of unnaturally vivid color.  An artist who was fascinated with the shape of things might reduce complex objects to simple geometry for the sake of emphasis.  Some modern paintings are not insipred by objects in the everyday world at all, but are an attempt to paint states of mind or reflect on color and shape as ends in themselves.   And what is wrong with any of this?  Nothing at all.  In fact it is a great tribute to human creativity.	2000-12-02

More than a decade before &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;  Mailer knew how to mix a thrilling crime drama with interesting  conversations and musings about life, love, and amature philosophy.  As Tim  tries to solve the mystery, he broods about ethnic and cultural differences  {he is a mixture of Irish and Jewish and the town is mostly Portugese},  history {he is obsessed with the Pilgrims and other aspects of local  history like  &quot;hell town&quot; a 19th century vice district}, wives,  parents and family life, cops, prison, alcohol, drugs, war and on and on.   In the hands of a bad {or even average} writer, this would just get  anaoying, but Mailer carries it off well.	2000-09-09

Someone has it in for Tim--a  struggling novelist and former criminal. After a night of heavy drinking  and quazi-amnesia, severed heads are turning up on his property and the  passenger seat of his car is drenched in blood.

A human soldier fights in an endless and pointless war against a misunderstood alien species.  He travels using an exotic technology which  instantly propels spaceships across the galaxy, but you see, there is just  one little catch---it TOTALLY screws up your place in the space-time  continuum.  After just a (subjectively) short trip, you come home to find  that many decades have passed.  The world is very different after ten,  twenty or one hundred years.  Are we living in the same world as our  ancestors in the 1700s or even the 1900s?  Are our views on the place of  the individual in society or on sex or race or religion much like their's?   Probably not.  Does our world look the same as theirs?  Absolutely not!    This is a great novel of culture shock.  The hero can never come home  because &quot;home&quot; was long ago.  It is no secret that the story was  largely inspired by the author's Vietnam experience.  The themes are there:   the traumatic war and a return to a place that has radically changed.  There are also common 70s themes like overpopulation, whcih seems to have  been a real preoccupation of writers of that era.   But for the most part  &quot;Forever War&quot; becomes more and more relevant with age.  In a  world of lightning-fast social and technological change we have all  probably woken up one morning and wondered where the world we knew has  gone.  &quot;Forever War&quot; is not, however, a reactionary yearning for  the &quot;good old days.&quot; It faces the challenge of the future with  courage and curiousity.	2000-08-09

Gibson's scary yet colorful  and oddly alluring future is one domiated by commerce, ego, and the persuit  of stimulation for its own sake.  It is a fast paced and enormous Darwinian  world that constantly threatens the individual; forcing eveyone to try  their best to be bigger, better and faster.  Yesterday's hot shot wastes  away in the gutters tomorrow.  Mistakes can be irrevocable, but success is  always fleeting. There is no stable sense of self--personality can be  programmed, or faked through technology (or even stored on a disk).   Everyone is just a flash of light on the vast world screen.   The plot line  follows Case, a doomed, burned out thief, on his desparate quest for just  one more taste of his former glory.  We meet &quot;street  samurai&quot;--tecnologically enhanced soldiers of fortune who have  sacrificed their humanity for superhuman prowess in combat. There are  &quot;panther moderns&quot;; members of an absurd, violent youth culture  and a highly advanced AI wanting equal rights with humans.  Average people  get plastic surgery and implants like we buy new clothes.  Civilized  governments scarcely exist except as corrupt facades.  Monopoly  corporations and crime lords rule in their place.   Part of the story  unfolds on the streets of a giant city in which places like New York,  Boston and Atlanta are merely local neighborhoods.   It is the world we may  be in the process of becoming and 99% of it is still as relevant ( or more  so ) today as it was in 1984 when the book was first printed.  Forget the  minor anachronisms like St. Petersburg still being called 'Leningrad.'   This is more realistic than science fiction can be expected to get.	2000-08-05

Not hokey little  green men or those stupid walking fetuses that are so popular these days.   No way!  The Moties are a work of absolute genius on Niven's part.  They  have their own solar sytem, described in vivid detail, their own complex  evolutionary history (based on asymetry, rapid reproduction and extreme  specialization) and a culture which is a logical outgrowth of their  environment and genetic traits.  Oh, and their civilization is VERY, very  old.   Human beings have been in space for 1000 years when this novel  opens, but have not yet discovered other intelligent life.   This fact  alone makes me respect Niven.  He doesn't create a bustling Star Trek  cosmos where you bump into a new super-advanced alien every time you turn  around.  As if survival and civilization building were easy.  He has a feel  for the vastness of the universe---how unfriendly to life and civilization  it can be.	2000-08-03

Take a all the decadent 80's glitz and glamor of &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;Wall Street&quot; and mix it with a good helping of the Faust legend and the book of Revelation and you get . .  . . The Quorum. In Mr. Newman's brilliant alternative late 20th century all  power is wielded from behind the scenes by Derek Leech--the incarnate Devil  who presides over the death of civilization in his ultramodern office  complex that resembles a shiny black pyramid.  The currency of the cosmos  is pain and to get ahead you must suffer to show yourself worthy--or CAUSE  suffering.  Leech doesn't care.  Three young college students strike up a  bargain with Leech.  The price of their sucess will the torment and  degradation of their &quot;friend,&quot; Neil.  As long as he is in agony,  their careers (writing, television, art, etc.) will soar.  They will rule  the 1980s; have everything their greedy hearts desire while Neil is framed  for crimes, pusued by terrorists and loses every lover, job, home and bit  of money that comes his way.<br />But now its the 90s and its time for the  three lucky fellows to pay the bill.  Just like in Dr. Faustus, the fun  can't last forever.  A deal with the Devil never quite turns out the way  you'd planned.	2000-04-04
