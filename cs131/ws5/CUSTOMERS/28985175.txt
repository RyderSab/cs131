Books	5	36	41	N	N	A Gutsy Move	With so much emotional attachment to the identity of being \\"Celtic\\", it was a gutsy move to publish a book bringing the Celtic identity of Britain into question. However, despite this, it is always good to take a fresh look at evidence from a different angle, whether one agrees with the conclusions or not.<br /><br />James presents his argument against a unified \\"Celtic\\" people in the British Isles, and presents this argument well. He especially calls into question the theory of a mass migration of Celtic peoples from Europe, demonstrating that there is very little archaeological evidence for it, especially when compared to regions where such migrations are known to have happened. In fact, the archaeological record just does not square with the theory.<br /><br />Unlike some, I did not find James' book overly burdensome with the details of what James was trying to say and how he approached it. Being from a non-archaeological background, I found this information both helpful and interesting. Admittedly, if you are experienced in such matters, you might find it a bit boring.<br /><br />It seems that James treats the evidence available from the archaeological record reasonably fairly, and presents a reasonably plausible argument for his views. He covers a lot of territory in such a small book, and at times, I would have liked to get more detail on some aspects of it.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed a book that dared rock the boat, and take a new look at the available evidence. In concluding that the identity of the British people as \\"Celtic\\" is an 18th century response due to political and social conditions of the time was a gutsy move, but one that needed to be made. James has hit a nerve, and some of the threats he has received are testament to that. A brave man, indeed!<br /><br />One note of caution: if you have absolutely no knowledge about Celts and theories of the Celtic identity of British people, I would suggest that you read a broader introduction. This book is not really an introduction to Celtic history in itself.to Celtic history in itself.	2005-10-10

For anyone who is interested in the story behind the music and the theatrics, this book simply is a must-have.<br /><br />The book itself is divided into three broad sections: a biographical account, an account that covers some territory in their later career and a section cataloguing and giving commentaries on every album and song KISS produced. This is one seriously detailed book, and one that is unique, (as far as I know), among KISS books, on a couple of aspects.<br /><br />For me, the most important \\"plus\\" for this book is the use of extensive notes taken by the author in 1979 during long interviews with the band. The manuscript back then never made to publication and sat forgotten until now. What is presented is that manuscript worked from the words of KISS themselves. What you get is pretty much solid quotation of what Paul, Gene, Ace and Peter said back in 1979, as well as comments from Bill Aucoin. Again, as far as I know, this has never been done in any other KISS book.<br /><br />Anyone from the hardcore fan to people discovering KISS for the first time, (or just rediscovering some long lost remnant of their youth, like me), \\"KISS: Behind the Mask\\" is a great read that engages you, grips you and takes you on the wild journey that was KISS. Totally awesome!	2005-09-30

The puns can be silly, but they completely cool and a good laugh.<br /><br />In addition, the humour of the situational aspects of the story line is also top notch.<br /><br />Graphically, the pictures are simple, but very pleasing and well executed for the type of book. The expressions, dialogues and details all add something nice to the mix, and make for excellent reading.<br /><br />Few graphic books have endured from childhood for me, but Asterix certainly has. I still enjoy having a good read of Asterix and his mate, Obelix.<br /><br />For something light, that still tickles the brain, and is a pure joy and laugh to read, Asterix can't be beaten.	2005-09-28

This is a story book, and not a graphic story like the others. So, if you are really looking for the graphic books, then don't buy this one.<br /><br />The story is mildly entertaining, but hardly up to the same standards of the comics. Without the graphics, some of the humour is lost, such as the expressions and other details that make the comics so endearing.<br /><br />Except for the most fanatical and hardcore Asterix fans, approach \\"The Twelve Tasks\\" with caution.	2005-09-28

In order to make the village come to heel, he decides to show them the benefits of Roman civilisation. Obelix starts selling menhirs to the Romans, and enjoys huge wealth and success. Soon, competition is breeding and jealousies erupt.<br /><br />This story is a great lesson on money, its corrupting influence, and also friendship.

There is a huge number of books that didn't and certainly are still notable for their contribution to the early church and its development.<br /><br />The Penguin Classics \\"Early Christian Writings\\" gives you a relatively good introduction to some of these books, including Clement's Epistle to the Corinthians, (it seems they didn't stop being naughty after Paul bashed them), letters from Ignatius of Antioch on his way to becoming pet food for lions, the Didache and a couple of others.<br /><br />Like other Penguin books, it is not the best translation available, but it is a good, cost-effective introduction to the books involved. It also affords you a nice insight into the early life of the church and what some branchs of it thought about various issues.<br /><br />I particularly found the Didache and Ignatius' letters interesting for various reasons. The Didache especially so for the brief glimpse it gives of early church life and teaching.<br /><br />Additionally, I found the translation to be more readable than other Penguin books, and this made getting through it that much easier. The translation is pretty good, and it is accessible and reasonably well styled for the modern reader.<br /><br />For a little reading that is different and interesting on early church matters, this little book is very good. I recommend it, and you won't regret spending just a few bucks on it.	2005-09-26

While not the best around, I did find it has some definite redeeming features, (apart from the end, of course).<br /><br />The NIV has a very useful cross-reference system, (for which it is justifiably well-known), that makes pursuing a particular topic or item through the Bible very easy. This makes finding things a breeze. In addition, and contrary to some, the subject index and concordance are pretty good. Yes, they are very basic, but this is a Bible and not a concordance in itself. I did not find anything wrong with them, and they were pretty useful.<br /><br />There has been some comment about the introductions to each book, and I have found to be reasonably balanced and realistic about the evidence. In some cases, I would personally suggest even later dates for the books than the NIV gives. While the introductions are not perfect, (for more detailed information, see the real evidence out there), they do the job. I don't see how dating books accurately according to evidence is \\"godless\\" or in anyway detrimental to the Bible. Anyway, back to the point: the introductions are not detailed, but they are adequate for the task.<br /><br />I found the translation to be ok in most cases, though in some places, it seems to soften the ideas and teachings of Christ. This is noticeable when it is compared with other versions, which take a more literal translation as a technique. A teaching on marriage and not being married seemed to be softened in the NIV as compared to others. While I have no problem with the \\"dynamic equivalence\\" method, (it is not paraphrasing, as some seem to think), the NIV highlights the need to check with a couple of translations, unless you are going at it from the Greek, as well. This is something which makes me cautious to recommend the NIV as a primary study reference.<br /><br />While limitations of space have a significant effect on how much commentary you get, the NIV could have a little more. Admirable effort at leaving the real thinking to the reader, but in some nasty places there was very little commentary given, and it would have been useful.<br /><br />Overall, the NIV is not bad, and certainly not worth burning along with the other heretical works. It does a good job, and it has some very good features that make studying it easy, functional and even fun. Apart from the concerns above, it is pretty good.itations of space have a significant effect on how much commentary you get, the NIV could have a little more.

Some of his thoughts on church discipline and just war had long term results that he may have disliked, but his personal journey was an interesting one.<br /><br />Written as a \\"letter\\" to God, \\"Confessions\\" takes the reader through Augustine's life of wandering searchs in a variety of places for the spiritual solace that he desired. His comments on Manichaeism, philosophy and Christianity are personal and coloured by his own experiences. His own thoughts are very negative and dark in places, though \\"Confessions\\" smacks of a brutal honesty that is rare. At times, his writings are coloured by his disappointments, such as meeting with Manichaean priests.<br /><br />The Penguin translation is sometimes a touch dry in the presentation of Augustine, and that can make reading a bit difficult in places. At times the style is a touch on the hard going side. However, being quite cheap, this book gives you a very cost-effective introduction to the life of the man.<br /><br />However, this should not detract from the overall value of such a personal look into the life and reflections of one of theology's great historical figures. While I felt this version was not the best, the personal look at Augustine's life, loves, and disappointments put some \\"flesh and blood\\" on the person who is so often quoted in theological text books and so on.<br /><br />If you have not read this, then I recommend doing so. It is a cool book.	2005-09-25

Segal's book \\"Life After Death\\" is my first read of his work, and certainly the most massive book I have read in some time. Considering the sheer scope of the topic Segal has attempted to cover, the size of the book should come as no surprise. However, the physical weight is where the \\"weightiness\\" ends.<br /><br />Now, before you freak out about over 700 pages of text on life after death, it should be emphasised that Segal writes in a very accessible and easy going manner. A few of the words he uses require a dictionary, (at least, I needed one), but the incidence of this was not a burden. Segal keeps you moving and presents a great level of quotation from ancient sources to highlight his points. His manner and style of presentation and discussion are absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />Segal presents the beliefs of different cultures from a more social viewpoint than anything, and deals with how these beliefs can illustrate what the people thought of about themselves and the world about them. What you end up with is a very interesting discussion not just on life after death, but also some of the political, cultural and social concerns that went into them. This makes for a very well-rounded discussion.<br /><br />Segal takes you through various cultures and civilisations, and throughout he inter-connects various ideas between them to show how they illustrate each other by contrast or simularity. These cultures include chapters on Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and Canaan, Israelite, (broken into various chapters), and much more, including detailed chapters on Christian views and their development through the centuries.<br /><br />This book is really a great overview of the topic, and it is relatively easy to find from Segal's referencing further material for more specific reading. Segal has done exceptionally well to squeeze such a vast topic into about 750 well-written and dynamic pages.<br /><br />This book gets a big \\"thumbs-up\\" from me. I will certainly be reading more of Segal's work in the future.inly be reading more of Segal's work in the future.	2005-09-22

While this is great, it also means that there is a lot of rubbish out there with \\"Kabbalah\\" printed on it. For the beginner or the curious, this can make getting at the real thing a bit daunting and difficult.<br /><br />Scholem's book \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\\" is rightly considered a classic in the field of Kabbalah and the study thereof. While somewhat aged, the book still retains its status as among the most respected of works.<br /><br />Scholem covers the major phases of Kabbalah, and includes sections on each one. He delves into the details, teachings, personalities and the impact of each phase, and brings the reader an erudite introduction to them. He includes early Jewish Merkabah mysticism, Lurianic Kabbalah, Abulafia, the Zohar, (a big section on this!) and even the very interesting Sabbatianism.<br /><br />I found some points of terminology a little objectionable in connection with Gnosticism, but this would not be an issue for the general, non-Gnostic reader. As such, it should not discourage you from reading it.<br /><br />As a starting point, Scholem's \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\\" is unbeatable for both its scholarly approach and also for Scholem's ability to make it all understandable and absorbable. This is a fantastic book and one worth getting. I could not praise this book enough.<br /><br />To be honest, if Gershom Scholem wrote it, you can't go far wrong with it.	2005-09-17

When sufficient cells started functioning to generate thought, it was \\"What the ****?\\" I believe I had run into the \\"Cow Tools\\" cartoon, so that might have had something to do with it.<br /><br />Over the years, I have grown to love Gary Larson's humour and sometimes warped way of seeing the world around him. Larson is one of the undoubted greats in humour and it was a sad day when all the bugs, cows, fat kids and dogs went their own ways.<br /><br />For anyone who has similar nostalgic feelings and longings for \\"The Far Side\\", \\"THe Prehistory of the Far Side\\" is an essential addition to the collection. The book covers pretty much everything, and includes a lot of cartoons in their original forms before the editors backed off publishing them in fear of the public outrage.<br /><br />The book oozes Larson's humour and wit, and not only informs, but it is a good laugh as well. Larson is not only a good cartoonist, but he is also good and writing something a little more narative and informative.<br /><br />\\"The Prehistory of the Far Side\\" is a must for any fan.	2005-09-15

As with public opinion about the movie, the opinions within the book are likewise mixed, though with a more thoughtful response.<br /><br />The book itself deals with the movie in 20 essays in 5 sections. They deal with everything from the alledged anti-semitism, the violence, Christ's suffering and so on. The contributors come from a variety of backgrounds, including theologians and philosophers from various stances. With such a good mix, the views presented are as wide and varied, while maintaining a consistently high level of thought and expression.<br /><br />The book goes some way to make the shock of the film itself more understandable and somewhat less of a brutalisation of the senses. Putting the excessive gore and blood of the movie into a wider philosophical context is an important function of the book.<br /><br />As per usual, I have thoroughly enjoyed this installment from the \\"Popular Culture and Philosophy\\" series. Once again, a big thumbs up to this volume. It is very good and recommeded to people from all walks of life.	2005-09-15

It is a tough one, and it is even tougher to understand, should one even want to try understanding it.<br /><br />\\"Interrogations\\" by Richard Overy goes some way into seeing how those brought to trial at Nuremberg dealt with the reality of what they had done and how they tried to explain it. The book gives some background information on the charges brought against them, the people carrying out the interrogations and so on. There are a couple of chapters on individuals such as Goering, Hess and Von Papen. Other chapters are based on topical issues, like genocide, Hitler himself, and so on.<br /><br />It is interesting the way which legal implications of the trials developed. One example is the way in which organisations themselves were deemed \\"criminal\\" and then anyone associated with them was open to arrest. The Nazi prisoners protested the move, of course.<br /><br />Of the individuals, I found Goering the most fascinating, in the sense that he did not seem to attempt any avoidance of responsibility. Others tried to distance themselves, or in the case of Speer, tried to show himself as a neutral civil servant. Goering never seemed to do that, and just accepted his part in it.<br /><br />People interested in the Nazi phenomena and the Holocaust of the Jews and other victims of the Nazi death camps, \\"Interrogations\\" is \\"essential reading\\", as another reviewer stated. Thoroughly engrossing and thoroughly recommended.	2005-09-10

Each religion covered is necessarily brief, but the main points are covered and should give someone a basic idea of what each religion is about.<br /><br />It should be remembered that McDowell is not writing from a purely intellectual and neutral stance, but is attempting to show why non-Christian religions are false. This really could be termed a work of polemics, though somewhat softer than the venomous prose of Tertullian. Before considering buying this book, it should be remembered that McDowell does have an agenda in writing it, and he is not neutral about the religions he discusses.<br /><br />As an adjunct to that agenda, McDowell will attempt to show why, from a Christian viewpoint, these religions are \\"wrong\\". That he would include his opinions should come as no surprise to anyone, seeing that he is a Christian and has a purpose other than merely describing these religions.<br /><br />One the bonus side, McDowell does not get into the overly technical language, and keeps it aimed at people who have had little to no exposure to the religions concerned. He has written a very accessible book.<br /><br />For Christians, the book has undoubted value. For others, there are much better and more neutral books available that do the same thing. Or even better, get the information straight from the source itself and read the religion's books for yourself. They are far more interesting, anyway, despite the large amount of time that it may take you.	2005-09-09

He claims he has used many sources, and has even included some hearsay or otherwise unconfirmed information. He certainly was not shy about airing their dirty laundry.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of ancient authors that get translated into English, Suetonius' style is very relaxed and very easy to get absorbed into. Even in translation, the book maintains a brisk pace and has enough to keep one interested until the last page.<br /><br />Suetonius' \\"The Lives of the Twelve Caesars\\" is a fascinating book, written with access to sources long lost to us.

Throughout the book, Williams systematically addresses central issues that have been cited as making up the Gnostic category, such as Gnostic interpretation, concepts of the body, ethical issues, and so on.<br /><br />I would like to mention a couple of examples where I find Williams' discussion lacking. These are only examples, and will precede some good points from \\"Rethinking 'Gnosticism'\\" as well.<br /><br />Firstly, Williams largely presents the category of Gnosticism in very simplistic terms, claiming that it is presented as \\"cliche\\" or \\"caricatures\\" of the religions so categorised. For ethics, Williams presents the ascetic or libertine options as the ones emphasised by previous understandings of Gnosticism. In contrast, while these elements have been discussed by other authors of note, they have not been presented in a way that obscures the complexity of Gnostic ethics in all its range, (a point in reference would be the Valentinians, who were very mild, middle-of-the-road types). In this sense, Williams seems to be shooting at shadows a bit.<br /><br />Secondly, Williams claims that the Gnostics had, at times, a more positive attitude to the body. While there is great complexity and variation among differing Gnostic sects, the basic negative view is fairly consistent. Even the Valentinians take a reasonably negative view to it, though they are relatively mild by Gnostic standards. The apparent positive statements and knowledge Gnostics found \\"encoded\\" in the body that Williams mentions do not negate this underlying negativity to the material world overall and the body in particular.<br /><br />While I disagree with Williams' overall position, I still feel that this book has definite value for someone studying Gnosticism's history and controversies. Williams reminds us that we must not get trapped by the \\"cliches and caricatures\\" that can easily influence our understanding. He does well at reminding the reader of some of the complexities of Gnostic thought.<br /><br />One aspect I particularly thought Williams handled well was the aspect of asceticism and libertinism. He draws out important details and discusses the evidence in fresh ways. While I do not think the evidence is there to support his position of throwing the category of Gnosticism out of the window, he does make some interesting and strong points in the details. While this is not consistently so, Williams does raise some very good issues.<br /><br />Despite some of the problems I have with Williams' overall conclusions, his book is an important contribution to the study of Gnosticism. He has dared rock the boat and get some rethinking going, which is always healthy. I would recommend the book to anyone who seeks an understanding of the problematic side of studying Gnosticism.world overall and the body in particular. <br /> <br />While I disagree with Williams' overall position, I still feel that this book has definite value for someone studying Gnosticism's history and controversies.

Most people seemed to love Scot and David Hicks' translation, so I thought it would be worth trying it. That choice was, indeed, a very good one, so thanks to all the reviewers who raved about this translation!<br /><br />Unlike some translations of older works, this one does not have that dry feeling to the style, and the language is very modern and easy to flow through. It has to be said that the translation has been with done with a lot of consideration for the meaning of Aurelius as well as the sensitivities and preferences of the modern reader in terms of language and style. Overall, an excellent translation to get into and read.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor's Handbook\\" is the first translation I have read of Marcus Aurelius' book, and I was surprised that Aurelius did not write it to be published. It is, rather, Aurelius' personal reflections and thoughts on life, himself and other things. His scope of topic matter is comprehensive, and the concise aphorisms give easily remembered ideas to think about yourself.<br /><br />The translators claim that you do not need to read it cover-to-cover, but can really start anywhere in the book. I tested this out, and they are right. I started reading in random places, and still got a good insight from the reading.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I would say that if you are looking for a good translation of it, buy this one. The reviewers here before me were right: it is an excellent translation and a very, very useful book. Food for life, one might say.	2005-08-27

A Maori \\"nobody\\", (Kooti), finds himself exiled to the Chatham Islands sometime after meeting Fairweather. After some time, the same guy manages to return to New Zealand with a band of fellow exiles and all full of the religious zeal of a \\"New Israel\\". Fairweather gets caught up in the events surrounding this, with his remarkably honest outlook on life and his position in it.<br /><br />The narrative itself is excellent, and maintains a frenetic pace that keeps you guessing at what will come next. In some places violent, the plot captures the essence of the day well, and Shadbolt's attention to detail is very much noted. Shadbolt's descriptions of the terrain and New Zealand of the time capture the land well, and almost drop you in the middle of it.<br /><br />The dialogues are very long in places, and you sometimes need to keep track of who is speaking. It takes a bit of time to get used to the English that is a little different from modern conventions and styles. However, once done, the dialogues themselves are rewarding reads in witticism and observations by the characters. Contrary to another reviewer, I did not find these a problem, nor did they get in the way of the overall plot.<br /><br />It is also in the dialogues that Shadbolt captures the prevailing attitudes of the colonists and settlers of the day regarding the Maori population. The arrogance and complete self-assurance that lead to some resounding beatings at the hands of the so-called \\"savages\\" who often displayed a far more Christian and civilised attitude than their \\"Christian betters\\".<br /><br />In short, \\"Season of the Jew\\" is a surprising book that is well written, colourfully filled with characters of substance, and keeps one going on for more to see what or who is lurking behind the next fern.<br /><br />For those with an interest in New Zealand, the book is based on true events around 1868, so it is well worth the read and effort to get.

The book did not fail to impress or keep me interested.<br /><br />Let me just say to begin with that Peter Lampe is very thorough in his approach and the scope of his study. Through this book, he looks into a variety of aspects within the Roman Christian community, using many different sources. Lampe looks at the locations within Rome where Christians tended to live, using a few different criteria. He also covers aspects of economic well-being within the Christian groups, and also what he calls \\"social stratification\\". Lampe also traces the origins of Christians, and tries to show where they tended to come from in terms of background and geographical origins. Lampe additionally looks at individuals, and how indicative they are of the community as a whole.<br /><br />Lampe's use of different sources is impressive, and he is very thorough in this respect. Sources include literary sources, (Jewish, Christian, pagan, philosophical, etc), along with archealogical sources from the catacombs to quite detailed discussions on grave sites around Rome and more. Lampe also uses computer-compiled lists of names found in the region, as well as other scholar's work. Lampe also makes use of the New Testament, though is is far from uncritical, and he is quite cautious and careful in his application of its data. Overall, I have found Lampe to be a careful and methodical scholar in his use of sources.<br /><br />Lampe also uses a lot of sources from Latin, Koine Greek and some other languages, (including French). While laudable, Lampe does not always provide translations in English, which can be somewhat frustrating at times. His quotations in Greek can be a paragraph long, and if you can't understand the language, you may miss out on some of the details.<br /><br />Peter Lampe also has some interesting chapters on individual people, including Marcion, the woman in Justin's \\"Apology\\", (some interesting theories here from Lampe), the author of \\"The Shepherd of Hermas\\" and others. I personally enjoyed these aspects of Lampe's study immensely, as he was able to throw some light onto the more individual and personal aspects of early Roman Christian life.<br /><br />Apart from the point about untranslated languages above, I found this book to be both informative and dynamic. At times, it can get a little swamped in the details, (such as tracing phrases and common motifs through various sources), but this is a rare thing. Usually, the book covers a lot of ground with flair and skill.<br /><br />For a look at Roman Christianity as the evidence seems to point, Peter Lampe's book is very good and it is very thorough, with lots of references and good, generous helpings of footnotes. I am rather glad that I read it, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.er Lampe also has some interesting chapters on individual people, including Marcion, the woman in Justin's \\"Apology\\", (some interesting theories here from Lampe), the author of \\"The Shepherd of Hermas\\" and others.

Logan's book \\"Gnostic Truth and Christian Heresy\\" has a controversial title, but is in itself a very detailed and scholarly work. It is not written for people who have not had some exposure to Gnosticism, or are unfamiliar with texts from Gnostic sources.<br /><br />Logan's basic theory is to posit an underlying myth to various works and to trace the various influences that can be seen throughout a group of Sethianised books. He posits two main redactions and also tackles the doctrinal content of them in each stage from given premises which he makes clear.<br /><br />For this book, I would recommend access to and familiarity with some of the following books: \\"Against Heresies\\", by Irenaeus of Lyon, (especially Book 1, Chapters 29 and 30), \\"The Apocryphon of John\\" in both the Short and Long Recensions, \\"The Gospel of the Egyptians\\", \\"The Three Steles of Seth\\", \\"The Trimorphic Protennoia\\", \\"On the Origin of the World\\", \\"The Hypostasis of the Archons\\" and a few more. Fortunately, most of these are available in James M. Robinson's \\"The Nag Hammadi Library\\", which makes it somewhat easier. Others are available from other sources, (some online).<br /><br />Logan's organisation is very clear and logical, as he deals with a broad theory of Gnostic origins. In some points, he is in broad agreement with other scholars, (eg. Carl Smith in \\"No Longer Jews\\"), though he does differ on some points of location and cause. He also deals with broad aspects of developing myth and doctrine thoughout the books he traces. These broad aspects include cosmogony, anthropogony, eschatology and much more. Logan places primary importance on the textual evidence, and his book reflects this concern.<br /><br />A second point is Logan's vocabulary, which can be pretty tough going at times. I found myself reaching for the dictionary on more than one occassion. In that sense, it was very challenging for me, but I learned a lot of new words, which is always good.<br /><br />Logan's book is a very detailed and very specialised look at the textual evidence that seems to point to Sethian and, to some degree, to Valentinian Gnosticism. Logan's writing is extremely weighty, though considering his task, I fail to see how it could be otherwise. Textual criticism figures highly in his book, so one should bear this in mind when considering it. In this sense, if textual criticism is what interests you, this book is surely to be heaven-sent.<br /><br />Logan covers a wide range of material, and he is very thorough in his approach and work. In short, it is a great book, but not one to introduce yourself to Gnosticism on.ogan's book is a very detailed and very specialised look at the textual evidence that seems to point to Sethian and, to some degree, to Valentinian Gnosticism.

Every time I mentioned the Qur'an, I heard the name Abdullah Yusuf Ali, it seemed. So, armed with a name, I came upon his translation and read it.<br /><br />Firstly, as a non-Muslim, I appreciated the fact that it was a translation by a Muslim that was widely recognised as the best available in English by Muslims. In this sense, the translation was handled with flair and skill. Ali did a marvelous job of translating a book and presenting the Qur'an in an easily understood form.<br /><br />The book has a lot of comments in it, in terms of commentary, and these proved helpful in gaining a Muslim's view of the verses being discussed. It is very easy to understand things through our own filters, so to have those commentary notes was a bonus. They are not comprehensive for the most part, but they are quite handy.<br /><br />The Ali translation also includes a study index to the Qur'an, which is exceptionally useful of you are looking for sections about a paricular topic. This is very useful if you do not wish to wade through the entire Qur'an looking for one or two sections.<br /><br />While the Qur'an can't give you the full range of Muslim theological thought and speculation in all its complexity, it does present the reader with the essential \\"Word of God\\" as Muslims know and read it. As a starting point, this is certainly an excellent choice coupled with the commentary notes already mentioned.<br /><br />For non-Muslims seeking to understand a religion that has been much maligned recently, Ali has given us a very accessible insight into the central book of Islam. The language is a little \\"King James Version\\" style, but it only adds to the character of the book.<br /><br />It is a great book and it won't get you laughed at like showing up with a Penguin Classics \\"Koran\\". I am still embarrassed by that....	2005-07-29

Some responses to the problem have been very extreme, (such as getting rid of the entire category of \\"gnosticism\\"). \\"No Longer Jews: The Search for Gnostic Origins\\" gives yet another theory in the long tradition of them.<br /><br />Smith's basic theory is that Gnosticism came out of the Jewish religion of Egypt as a response to the devastaion caused by the suppression of the Jewish Revolt of 115-117 AD. In doing this, Smith provides some good discussion on other theories, and even examples of scholars who have exemplified those theories. Smith has also made clear that he cannot directly link the Revolt to the \\"Gnostic turn\\", as he calls it, but demonstrates a strong argument based on what evidence is available.<br /><br />He has also discussed in detail some of the foundational guidelines he has used in order to arrive at his conclusions. In Smith's opinion, the unique idea that formed Gnosticism is its \\"radical anti-cosmic dualism\\", without which Gnosticism would never have been known except as \\"another Judaism, Christianity or Platonism\\". It is this thought that he has primarily used to trace the beginnings of Gnosticism. Other aspects of Gnostic thought, while important, are not seen as totally unique to Gnosticism and Smith refuses to use parts to postulate the whole. For example, there were many docetists around in the 1st century, though one cannot argue a 1st century Gnosticism because of the them. Later Gnostics were not all docetists and not all docetists were Gnostic. In this sense, I think Smith has wisely and clearly defined his thinking.<br /><br />In addition, Smith has delved deeply into the chronology of primary sources, (including the Nag Hammadi Library), the heresiologists, Gnostic teachers and much else. Smith also deals wiht the historical background surrounding the Revolt of 115-117 AD, and this serves to illustrate later points.<br /><br />Smith uses a huge range of other scholars to interact with, and also to highlight his own points. The footnotes provide a plethora of reference material for further reading. I have noted that some of the references are from an evangelical Christian background, (such as Edwin Yamauchi who shows up in Christian dictionaries at times, and Pheme Perkins). While the types of scholar do not constitute anything like the full range, I did sometimes wonder how far they had influenced Smith to argue for a later date to Gnostic origins. Despite these misgivings, I found Smith to interact honestly and openly with the evidence he presented and to be very clear with his assumptions, guidelines and principles of methodology. My misgivings are probably more a product of my own paranoia.<br /><br />\\"No Longer Jews\\" takes a very thorough and scholarly look at the problem of Gnostic origins and does so with a keen eye to detail and careful explanation. Smith is also cautious in the conclusions he draws, and is careful not to overstate his case.<br /><br />In addition, anyone would find the book accessible, though a previous knowledge of Gnosticism is assumed. If you do not know what Gnosticism teaches or believes, (from scholarly sources), then do not start with this book.<br /><br />Smith has sparked my own interest in this mysterious question of just where the Gnostics came from and why.

This is not sci-fi in the usual sense, though it is in the same Heinlein vein of pushing the creative envelope to new extremes.<br /><br />The plot follows ultra-normal Alexander Hergensheimer through a series of dimensional leaps. After each leap, he has no idea where he is or what he is doing. His identity also changes as people are convinced he is Alec Graham. The leaps are timed exactly to be at the very moment Alexander gains his footing in a new world and life. Add to all this, Alexander being a fairly religious soul, and his attempts to respond to the unreal events, the book takes on a depth that is intriguing.<br /><br />Again, this book is not a blast through inter-galactic reachs of space, fighting off hoardes of raging, man-eating beasts from Struncklebor VI. However, it does take a good hard look at life as we experience it, and postulates what would happen and how it would feel if your life spun out of control at a fundamental level that you could neither understand or could not even imagine. And if this happened merely for someone's entertainment.<br /><br />It is an interesting book for those spiritually inclined, and also for those of a more Gnostic bent. The book provides a good discussion about beliefs and the type of God who would play games with a human life just for the sheer entertainment of it. In addition, Alexander's attempts to understand and interpret his experiences in terms of his faith, which remains steadfast, add another dimension to a very deep book.<br /><br />I have read the book twice and have gained something different from it with each reading. I am now considering a third reading to see what it is like from an \\"older\\" perspective. This is the type of book that will be readable for years to come, and will change with you.<br /><br />Of course, that is if this is the type of book you get a buzz from.

US	28985175	R1PSLSL8NI8CJF	0449213943	15707610	All Quiet on the Western Front	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Through Their Eyes	Based on the experiences of the author in the German army during the First World War, \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" is unique and has endured as a classic tale of men fighting in the trenches. Its uniqueness comes from the fact that it tells the story from a German perspective, and from the viewpoint of looking out over No Man's Land, not from some command post miles behind the lines.<br /><br />The story basically follows a group of schoolmates who enlist in the German army, influenced by the patriotic exhortations of their teacher. The reality of their situation soon sinks in and they find themselves in a war that is incomprehensible in its mindless use of human life to achieve nothing, and the requirements for ever younger boys to go and fight.<br /><br />The parallels to the Anzac and British experiences are poignant, such as Paul Baumer and his mates joining up with patriotic dreams of honour and adventure. The average German soldier was not the barbarian invader that British propaganda made him out to be. He had much in common with any French, Anzac, or British soldier.<br /><br />Another element that is portrayed well, particularly in Paul, is the soldier's struggle to maintain some level of humanity in the face of such inhumanity. Powerful moments are when Paul shares a shellhole with a dying French soldier who Paul has stabbed. Paul's realisation that the French soldier was a human being, a person, and someone with a family was a powerfully emotive moment.<br /><br />\\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" is not a happy book, nor does it make any comments about the necessity of war or otherwise. What it does present in graphic ways is the cost of war in terms of immediate loss of life, and also in wider terms in the struggle to avoid some loss of humanity on the part of those unfortunate enough to have to fight.<br /><br />This is a great book and a deserved classic, and one that should be read by anyone seeking to understand war.	2005-07-24

I have often been taken with his willingness to push the envelope and tackle some interesting questions with a unique and, at times, disturbing angle.<br /><br />The basic theme of cheating death by having your brain transplanted into another person's body is weird enough in its own right. However, add that the main character, Johann Sebastian Bach Smith, is male and he wakes up to find he is now a she in the body of Eunice, his personal assistant. The book basically follows his struggles to cope with the new identity, and also deal with the residual presence of Eunice in the body.<br /><br />Action-packed sci-fi this is not, but it is interesting in the ethical issues that it raises. The questions posed about prolonging life by the use of another's body are interesting and distasteful in some ways.<br /><br />The association of a name carrying heavily religious and musical connections with such a selfish man as Smith adds something of a commentary on the book's central premise and the issues connected with it.<br /><br />\\"I Will Fear No Evil\\" is not a bad book, but certainly one for select tastes and only hardcore Heinlein fans. Those readers who have some philosophical interests in ethics might also enjoy the book. For those looking for more conventional sci-fi novels, treat this one with caution.	2005-07-24

I am not a great fan of comic books and have never really been into them in any way. I have also not really been impressed by the movies made from the more popular comic book heroes, (though X-Men was very cool). \\"Superheroes and Philosophy\\" proved to be an excellent choice of read despite these issues for me.<br /><br />If you are likewise someone who has never read a comic book, or does not have Daredevil Issue #134, don't worry! Even if you missed the movies, don't worry! The contributors to the book have written their essays in such a way that anyone can enjoy them. Also, some superheroes are such cultural icons that any familiarity with the comics or the movies is basically unnecessary. The essays quote some of the comic books, but even the most unfamiliar characters pose no problem due to the explanations given.<br /><br />Another aspect that was notable is that not all of the contributors are philosophers in the strict sense. Some of them are working in the industry of the superheroes for the companies that publish the books themselves. Shattering my previously held mythical belief that people who wrote comics were just adults going through prolonged puberty, some these contributors made the most astute and detailed observations about their craft. I was singularly impressed with the reflections they made on their own work, and the characters with which they dealt.<br /><br />Other contributors made their essays relevant by focusing on the challenges that superheroes present to us and the questions they raise over how we live life. Bringing the more personal element into philosophy as shown through various heroes drew the concepts into reality and made them less abstract and more \\"concrete\\". This was something this volume achieved more than other volumes that I have read in the same series.<br /><br />Comic fan or not, this is a book that fits well with the high standard set by other books in the \\"Popular Culture and Philosophy\\" series.

These opponents were defenders of \\"orthodox\\" faith, so they had their own agenda to push. Irenaeus of Lyon, (c. 185 AD), said that to mention the Gnostic teachings is to refute them, so confident was he in the inherent stupidity of Gnosticism.<br /><br />With the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library, we finally have the Gnostics speaking for themselves and presenting themselves in their own ways. Our knowlegde of Gnosticism has increased by light years. After decades of politics, back-biting and dealing, the NHL has finally arrived in a single volume, translated into English.<br /><br />It should be made clear that not all of the works found at Nag Hammadi are strictly Gnostic, though a majority are. Works in the corpus include \\"The Gospel of Truth\\", \\"The Gospel of Thomas\\", \\"The Apocryphon of John\\", \\"The Three Stelaes of Seth\\", \\"The Hypostasis of the Archons\\" and a huge range of other works. You will find everything from quite moderate Valentinian Gnosticism, (like the Gospel of Truth), right through to the more intense Sethian Gnosticism. In addition are books that are arguably Gnostic, but having elements that are decidely not Gnostic at all, such as \\"The Teachings of Silvanus\\". There is even a book of Gnostic polemics against the \\"orthodox\\" Christians!<br /><br />Another note of caution is that some of the works are very strange and symbolic in nature. Some are reasonably clear, though there are elements that are certainly confusing. For example, \\"The Apocryphon of John\\" is reasonably easy to get to grips with. However, others are truly hard work. My point: this is not suitable book to begin with if you have never read about Gnosticism or have only read a little about it.<br /><br />On the other hand, for people looking for more detail and a deeper knowledge and appreciation of the Gnostics, this book is a priceless aid and addition to any library. For those looking to walk the Gnostic path, the book provides a wide range of ideas that will give you a lifetime of speculation and work. In fact, it is hard to know where to start in this book, there is so much there.<br /><br />An example of something that surprised me pleasantly is the great deal of Gnostic ethics that is presented. These ethical standards have a high level that stands in stark and glaring contrast to the picture painted by the likes of Irenaeus, (mentioned above).<br /><br />To conclude, I would caution people about buying this book as an introduction to Gnostic belief. For introductions, you would be better with Jonas' [[ASIN:0807058017 The Gnostic Religion]] or Rudolph's [[ASIN:0060670185 Gnosis: The Nature and History of Gnosticism]], both being very good.

Introducing a much neglected area of study in English, Lupieri helps bring the Mandaeans to a wider audience.<br /><br />The book itself covers a large range of topics, and can sometimes get a little disorganised within each chapter. However, Lupieri does write with style and once he is through the drier section on Mandaean ritual, Lupieri really comes into his own. It is when he starts to discuss the beliefs and history of the Mandaeans that Lupieri's enjoyment and love of the subject shine.<br /><br />Perhaps the most endearing aspect of the book is that Lupieri assumes no previous knowledge of either the Mandaeans or the wider religion of Gnosticism. In this sense, the book really makes the perfect introduction to Mandaean religion. The reader is not weighted down with heavy, theological concepts and the discussion keeps moving at a healthy pace.<br /><br />Lupieri is also very clear about the variety of Mandaean ideas, and even the way they contrast with each other. As he writes, sometimes Mandaean thought just doesn't fit our sense of \\"logic\\". This makes it all the more interesting.<br /><br />With a good section that gives you more ideas for further reading, \\"The Mandaeans: The Last Gnostics\\" is a fantastic starting point. For me, this could be start of a beautiful journey in reading....and extensive damage to my financial state.	2005-07-12

Being a majorly fanatical fan of anything connected with [[ASIN:B00000K19E The Matrix]], I was also somewhat disappointed at first with the two sequels. So, with some interest, I approached \\"More Matrix and Philosophy\\" wondering what the contributors were going to say about these two movies.<br /><br />First up, as others have mentioned, I would also reiterate that one should read \\"The Matrix and Philosophy\\" before approaching this book. Some contributors make reference to that book, and use it as a spring board for some further development of ideas. Also, on one occassion, a contributor in \\"More Matrix\\" takes a mild stab at a contributor in the first volume.<br /><br />In this current volume, one is taken through 4 Scenes, which have 16 essays categorised across them. Some who contributed to the last book are back again. The essays cover a very interesting range of ideas, and have a lot of diversity among them. These include essays on faith, nihilism, God, Islamic cosmology, the Vedanta of Hinduism, race, determinism and choice, and a lot more besides. The range of topics is impressive, and kept me hooked right through the book.<br /><br />For those frustrated by the first volume's repeated flogging of Plato's \\"cave analogy\\", you will be gratified to know that it is only mentioned a couple of times, and not really discussed in any detail outside the first chapter.<br /><br />In general, I found that the contributors made an excellent survey of the movies, and also brought out some very interesting issues. I didn't find that I disliked any of the essays, though on some points I disagreed with them. In general, the contributions were interesting, well-written, at times humorous, and easily understood.<br /><br />In this follow-up volume, I think that the book defies Lou Marinoff's idea that sequels are generally bound to fail, (\\"Why the Sequels Failed\\", in this book). I found it to be in some ways more interesting than the first volume, and wider in the various aspects that it discussed.<br /><br />If you have read and enjoyed [[ASIN:081269502X The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real (Popular Culture and Philosophy)]], then I really recommend this book to you.

The final book, \\"Mostly Harmless\\", is a surprising one, and pleasantly so.<br /><br />The book simultaneously follows the exploits of Arthur, Ford Prefect and Trillian in a universe that is made all the more bewildering by the fact that there are millions of dimensions. It also adds into the story a sub-plot of the Guide being taking over by Vogons, which then puts the Earth in danger. Add to this heady mix the teenage angst of Random, and something even for conspiracy theorists in The King.<br /><br />Adams retains much of his scalpel of sardonic observation in this book, though he cuts all the more deeply in what we consider reality to be. It is with disturbing, and sometimes confusing, explanations that he rattles our sense of having a handle on it all. In this sense, Adams has achieved a lot in \\"Mostly Harmless\\", creating a book that both gives the reader something to think about, as well as a very funny story.<br /><br />The only thing I would say is that the ending seems a little lacking in substance and it seemed like Adams was in a bit of a hurry to finish it. The ending was not memorable, and in this way was a little disappointing.<br /><br />However, if you have made it through the previous 4 volumes, then reading the fifth is certainly something worth doing. It is certainly better than the previous 2 books, and it has a lot of positives. It is a funny book, and very well written. Adams really has a gift for using language to play games with one's sense of perception and reality. It was a great book to end a great series.	2005-06-24

This relationship develops into something quite deep, and adds a new element to very different book from the previous three books.<br /><br />The freakish element continues with Wonko the Sane's inside-out house, and the Rain God who doesn't know he is a rain god. Overall, the book largely centres on Arthur and Fenchurch on Earth, though they are both suitably weird to be entertaining.<br /><br />The book seems to end very suddenly just when Ford, (absent for most of the book), Arthur and Fenchurch set off to find God's Final Message to His Creation. The end comes very abruptly, and surprised me. I was expecting more in the way of galactic adventures, actually. Apart from this sudden ending, the story is easier to read and has less of the silliness than the last volume indulged in. However, God's Message was simply cool, and worth the read. Tinged with some sadness, the Message makes a fitting end to any book written by Adams.<br /><br />Once or twice the details lacked continuity, such as when Fenchurch and Arthur were moving her cello. It suddenly appears at the second floor. These breaks sometimes caused some interruption to flow, though not a big deal generally.<br /><br />\\"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\\" is an improvement on the last book, and this is especially notable in the funny dialogues that happen between characters, such as with Wonko the Sane. While not in the league of the first book in terms of laughter-factor, it adds a new and interesting side to the saga that is nice and entertaining.	2005-06-20

I would not agree that it has lost some focus, but it certainly has shifted it to more fundamental aspects of life we hold dear, such as cricket.<br /><br />In some ways, this volume delves into a somewhat darker side of Adams' imagination, or at least makes it more obvious and clearly visible. This dark side also achieves new heights in sheer weirdness, which is sometimes genius, but sometimes merely silly. For instance, Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged has a magical sense of timing in his quest to insult a universe that he no longer finds any joy in. His response to those who questioned his quest's technical feasability: \\"A man can dream, can't he?\\" I love the guy! However, this is counter-balanced by some pretty silly stuff, too. At the end of it, even the silly stuff is just plain old fun: pointless, stupid, and really silly, which is everything fun should be.<br /><br />At times, the book does fall into the danger of repeating itself at times, or repeating sections of information again. While not a very common thing, it happens enough to be noticeable. If I can notice it, most people would probably see it like a 300m neon sign advertising McDonalds in Bombay.<br /><br />Overall, in this book Adams turns his comic eye to more fundamental issues of life, I think. This he started in the second book, \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\", but it really hits top speed in \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\". Issues such as reincarntion and coincidence come up, (remember those petunias that thought, \\"Oh no, not again\\"?). Also the way we see our world around us is also poked and prodded via the people of Krikit and their unique response to the wider universe. I really think this book delves a bit deeper than the previous two, which has taken awhile to realise.<br /><br />While the book is not painfully funny, it still retains a similar humour that is distinctly Adams. In some parts, it may seem a bit out there, but it is also truly broad in its scope, (from reincarnation to bistro billing is pretty wide in range).<br /><br />I liked the book a lot, but I cannot say that I loved it like the other two.

It is with such scenes that Adams continues his story from the first book and continues to take to human sensibilities with a scalpel.<br /><br />\\"The Restaurant At The End of the Universe\\" is full of wry and completely mind-distorting characters, scenes and information about a universe we didn't imagine. Following the intrepid Zaphod, Trillian, Ford and Arthur on more Galactic adventures, the book takes you through some amazing places.<br /><br />The book is replete with weird characters, such as Hotblack Desiato, who is spending a year dead for tax purposes. Also, the Man who Rules the Universe, who proceeds to spend a week talking to a table, after a fruitless encounter with his cat. Also, there is the Total Perception Vortex, the only machine to be able to destroy one's soul, though with Zaphod it just told him what he always knew: he was the most important thing in the universe.<br /><br />This second volume in the series continues and develops the mystery of why Zaphod became President of the Galaxy, why he stole the \\"Heart of Gold\\" and other seemingly insane schemes in the previous book. The mystery comes more into the foreground, though this does not distract any from the adventures of Dent and Ford. The sense of Zaphod being driven by something that he has no hope of understanding, including himself, takes a more urgent feel in this volume.<br /><br />This second volume really requires the first, \\"The Hitch Hikers' Guide to the Galaxy\\", to lend context to \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\". However, the second volume loses nothing in the comic genius of the story, and it is an excellent continuation. This all the more remarkable as the first book set the bar very high.<br /><br />If you liked \\"The Hitch Hikers' Guide to the Galaxy\\", then you will be sure to enjoy a dinner of apocalyptic proportions.	2005-06-12

I have not read the book since I was in high school, so I was very interested in seeing what would seem different. I was very, very surprised at the difference. What had been an amusing, but hardly nerve-shatteringly funny, was transformed into a very funny book indeed.<br /><br />The success in Adam's skills in seeing completely normal human life from a totally alien perspective is amazing. It is something that has been exceptionally noticeable the second time around. For example, the way in which mice were conducting experiments on humans and Slartibartfast marvelling at their genius in doing so.<br /><br />The book also takes a keen stab at human nature and our foibles in more than one way. From God \\"vanishing in a puff of logic\\" to \\"pan-dimensional beings\\" trying to find the answer to life, the universe and everything, and then finding that they needed to work out the question to the answer. Confused? So were the \\"pan-dimensional beings\\".<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a genius in comic, Monty-Pythonesque humour mixed with healthy doses of sci-fi. Even if you have read it before, it will entertain you for another run through it. I loved every part of it, and don't wonder that it is a classic.	2005-06-07

While much of the book is devoted to the pre-war years and life in country Victoria, the book presents a unique insight into a soldier's experiences and memories written in later life.<br /><br />Roy Kyle began writing the notes for this book when he was 89, and then died before he had completed it. Bryce Courtney worked on the introduction and provides a chapter called \\"Background to the War Years\\". Courtney's notes provide useful background information that sets the context for Kyle's memories, without which Kyle would be hard to understand in some places unless the reader were Australian or had previous knowledge of Gallipoli. I learned a few things from reading Courtney's additions. Courtney does betray a sense of disgust at the sheer numbers of lives lost and the commanders' apparent disregard for the lives of their men. I suspect that Courtney's disgust was a heartfelt response to the research he needed to do in editing Kyle's notes.<br /><br />Kyle's writing is very informal and is very much that of an ordinary person making notes about what he remembers. He also makes note of those people and events that have \\"faded from memory\\" in places, though it has to be admitted that his memory for details was amazing after so many years.<br /><br />In some parts, Kyle's memories are truly harrowing, and I was pretty sickened by some of the things he saw. At least once, he just leaves the details out, and states that someone's death was \\"truly horrific\\". For someone as Kyle to say that something is \\"truly horrific\\" must be a classic in understatement.<br /><br />In some parts, Kyle's memories are truly hilarious, and add something of a lighter side to the whole affair. Of particular note was when a divisional parade collapsed into chaos when a hare decided to make a run for it across the beach through the legs of the men at attention. Apparently, the General just left in disgust. The hare....well, you will just have to read the book.<br /><br />The book, at times touching, at times harrowing, but always honest, direct and moving, is a fantastic read and a great memoir of a man who fought with the Anzacs. Unlike books written by the armchair historians and those commanders who were safely behind the lines, Kyle takes you right into it, and puts you smack in the middle of the sweat, flies, stench and dysentry.<br /><br />Although a \\"sideshow\\" to the main war in Europe, Gallipoli is permanently burned into the Australia and New Zealander pysche. \\"An Anzac's Story\\" gives you a first hand glimpse of life and death there.

Jung, vol.11) (Bollingen Series) (v. 11)	Books	5	59	59	N	N	Compact and Comprehensive	Jung's \\"Answer to Job\\" was recommended to me by friends, and after some procrastination, I finally decided to give it a read. My only regret is that I waited so long to get around to it. I was surprised by both the candor and the comprehensive sweep of the book.<br /><br />It should be understood that this book is not a book on pure theology, though theological issues inevitably arise. Jung himself emphasises that he is a \\"layman\\" in this area. He also makes plain that the book is a subjective response to Job. Jung also works from an orthodox premise, taking as given that the Father of Jesus Christ and Yahweh are the same being. With these born in mind, Jung's book is informative, interesting and very thought-provoking.<br /><br />Jung's book has three main sections to it, as far as I could tell. First, he discusses the Book of Job, and the situation surround Job's life, trials and the drama played out with Satan. This section is darkly humorous, often eliciting a chuckle at Jung's descriptions of Yahweh. This aspect truly surprised me immensely, though pleasantly so. Jung treats Yahweh honestly, and is not shy of pointing out Yahweh's faults, which are many and abundant. Yahweh's apparent willingness and readiness to take Satan's bait, Yahweh's readiness to violate his own laws and so on are all mentioned and raised.<br /><br />As the book progresses, Jung starts to address the pyschological processes within Yahweh, as he sees them. The book also gets more serious, losing that dark humour. Some aspects were a bit difficult understand the workings of, like the failure of Yahweh \\"to consult his omniscience\\" in dealing with Job. It seemed to me that there was a separation between Yahweh and some part of his being, which I could not grasp very well. That said, this is the first book of psychology that I have read, so those more familiar may have a better understanding of it than I.<br /><br />Thirdly, Jung enters into a discussion on the psychological processes of people who have become \\"incarnations of the spirit\\", (Jung's words, paraphrased a bit). In this section, Jung discusses the Book of Revelation in detail, tackling some of the issues that book raises, especially in the contrast between the Jesus of the Gospels and the Jesus of Revelation.<br /><br />Overall, the entire book is definitely interesting, and gives one a lot of food for thought. Jung takes an honest and very open look at the problems raised by Yahweh's dealings with Job, and uses that as a spring board for a broader discussion on psychology from Jung's perspective.<br /><br />Despite my own problems of understanding parts in detail, I still enjoyed the book immensely, and have a lot of new ideas to think about. The book was well written, and certainly has a lot crammed into the 108 pages of text, (not including other stuff).<br /><br />However, nowhere does Jung go so far as the Gnostics to say that Yahweh is an inferior and ignorant demiurge. While criticising Yahweh, Jung offers a pyschological explanation as to why Yahweh seemed to be an absolute cretin to a man who was blameless in his sight; as good an explanation as I have ever read or heard.<br /><br />For such a topic, it is pretty rare to find a book that gives so much to ruminate on in such a small space.

It was with relish that I began to get into this book.<br /><br />Andrew Welburn wisely and makes quite clear that he is not getting into the arguments that do not directly concern him, such as the status of the New Testament canon and what should have or shouldn't have been included. In this sense, Welburn stays completely focused on the specific task he has set himself. In this book he attempts to show that esotericism was not an anomaly in Christianity, but a central and vital aspect of it and its development.<br /><br />Before saying anything else, I would strongly advise that one familiarise oneself with the ideas and philosophy of Rudolph Steiner. Welburn has been deeply influenced by Steiner, seemingly to the point that Steiner can do no wrong. Steiner's influence permeates the book, and the reader will often encounter comments on how strikingly new evidence from Qumran and Nag Hammadi has just confirmed Steiner's research. In fact, you might be frustrated by the repeated references to Steiner's \\"spiritual research\\" that are all over the place.<br /><br />Through the book, Welburn traces the esoteric aspects of Christianity back to the early development of Judaism, as well as received elements from Zoroastrianism via the Essenes, who seem to have re-interpreted some aspects of Zoroastrianism in light of the individualistic nature of their own Jewish faith. Among other points of discussion are the ways in which John the Baptist showed some affinity with Essene ideas and also how and why a large number of Essenes seem to have become Christian sometime after Jesus Christ vanished. The book includes discussions on Gnosticism, Jesus and Buddha, as well as some chapters on various Gospels.<br /><br />At some points, Welburn seems to over-simplify things where he sees connections. He seems to accept as a given, for example, pre-Christian Gnosticism, which is still an open debate with little evidence to give any indication either way. He focuses on a very select group of Gnostics. In addition, he attempts to reduce Gnosticism overall to a reaction against the non-mythological tendencies of the Essene fusion of Eastern thought with Jewish individualism and views of time. In Welburn's opinion, Gnosticism was basically keeping a mythological aspect of religion while accepting the reality of this world as a finished and complete product. Basically, Gnosticism was the mythological reaction to the same impulses that produced the Essenes.<br /><br />On the positive side, Welburn has made some interesting connections, and uses the primary sources well to illustrate various points that he has made. While I would not accept some of his views wholeheartedly, he does present some interesting views and possible theories on what may have happened. For example, he presents a strong case for the Essene influence on early Christians, John the Baptist and Jesus Christ. He presents a number of points that indicate that both Jesus and John, (John worked about 10 miles from Qumran, according to Welburn), were familiar with Essene ideas and possibly were associated with the sect. Welburn does not make the claim that John or Jesus were Essenes, but says that it is unlikely, especially considering Jesus' attitude to the Law, which the Essenes were particularly strict about.<br /><br />The discussion on the Gospel of Matthew was fascinating, and Welburn indicates that there was a previous Gospel of Matthew that was written in Hebrew from which the Greek was translated. Welburn supplies some interesting evidence in support from various sources, and makes a solid case. The Essene influence seems more pronounced in the sections that have survived of this Hebrew Gospel of Matthew.<br /><br />There is much more to this book, though, which I will not go into here. I found myself very interested in what Welburn says, and found his ideas to be fascinating. He makes some good, strong points, but I also have my doubts on a few others. However, for a book that presents an alternative view of Christian origins focusing purely on the esoteric side, the book is good. I would just reiterate the Steiner issue above before one started to read this. Even if you disagree with him, Welburn gives one the chance to think about Christianity in a new light and develop that thinking in new ways. Overall, it is a pretty good book, though I would not suggest it as an introduction to Christian origins in general.says, and found his ideas to be fascinating.

The book was not a bad one, though I honestly felt it was not in the league of \\"Beyond Belief\\" and \\"The Gnostic Gospels\\".<br /><br />Be in no doubt, that Pagels retains her high skills of presenting a complex matter in a simple and accessible manner. She has presented her ideas and material well, and the book follows a logical sequence that is easy to follow and retain as you advance through the book from Jewish thought through to the \\"Demonizing of the Heretics\\". For the lay person with no previous exposure to religious thought on Satan, this book is certainly a good one.<br /><br />That would be if the book was on Satan per se. As I read this book, I was perplexed at the seeming lack of Satan's presence in it. The book could well have been entitled \\"The Symbol of Satan in Christian Vilification\\". Pagels focuses on the development of Satan from a purely human perspective by following how early Christians especially used Satan to \\"demonise\\" and also \\"vilify\\" their opponents. The book begins by discussing Satan's first appearances and uses in the early Old Testament and then tracing that use through to the Christian period. The discussion is largely set within the political concerns of the authors themselves and how the wider historical context influenced how opponents of faith were seen to change and how Satan was seen to be embodied in those opponents.<br /><br />I must add that the book does an excellent job of following through this historical use of Satan as a symbol and motif. If this type of historical overview is what you are looking for, then \\"The Origin of Satan\\" is really your book, and I would recommend it wholeheartedly. However, if you are looking for a more \\"theological\\" discussion, then perhaps there are better books out there that concentrate more on the theological issues of Satan.<br /><br />Something of a repetitive comment from me regarding most Pagels books is again the lack of referencing in certain important points. Once again, I found myself wanting to check some point Pagels had made and see what books would provide some insight. Sadly, I sometimes found no footnote or reference. More referencing would have been nice just to get some ideas on where to read more.<br /><br />For what the book was, I really enjoyed it, though I have to agree that it was not quite what I expected. Qualified by the remarks above, I found it to be a good book, though again not in Pagels' usual league of excellence.>Something of a repetitive comment from me regarding most Pagels books is again the lack of referencing in certain important points.

Some people have reacted with nervous condemnation of such a book, and I suspect the authors revel in the notoriety to some degree, (the back cover calls it \\"a genuine manual of the 'left-hand path'\\").<br /><br />Unlike \\"The Satanic Bible\\", this book is full of ceremonies, sex and invoking demons. The authors present the invocation of demons and the pacts as a negotiation between equals, rather than having to grovel in the mud before a supreme \\"God\\".<br /><br />The book includes some excerpts from various grimoires, which provide some interesting insights into what ideas are lurking in the circles of black magic. These excerpts are reasonably lengthy, and include \\"The Constitution of Pope Honorius the Great\\". The book also includes lots of the sigils for various spirits that one could contact for a chat. Other pictures of demons and possible ritual arrangements look like nothing more than cheap glam-metal pictures from a pirated heavy metal CD of the early 1980's.<br /><br />Other chapters include a brief historical overview of Lucifer, as well as more recent influences on attitudes to the dark path. The section on personal testimonies was quite interesting, and the author seemed to have a fairly stoic attitude when a demon decided to rough him up a bit.<br /><br />The writing itself is very good and simple to follow. The authors have an obvious enthusiasm for the subject, and that comes out. The style has a nice flow, and it does not load you down with grandiose rubbish that sometimes comes with religious books.<br /><br />Overall, the book was not brilliant, but it was interesting in some ways. I have to admit that the question \\"Oh, really?\\" kept lurking in the back of my mind as I read this. The book could be useful for those seeking a new direction in their spirituality, though how reliable \\"Pacts with the Devil\\" is, I have no idea. I have not tried any of their ceremonies.<br /><br />For an introduction to the left-hand path, there are other books that I would suggest one read over this one, (\\"The Satanic Bible\\" being one, for its brevity and concise nature, among other things). All in all, the book was not bad, but it was average and no more.roduction to the left-hand path, there are other books that I would suggest one read over this one, (\\"The Satanic Bible\\" being one, for its brevity and concise nature, among other things).

Written by Rabbi Luzzatto, a Master of Kabbalah himself, \\"The Way of God\\" has become available in English thanks to Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan.<br /><br />Let me say from the beginning that the book is one of the best introductions to a living faith within a Kabbalist framework that I have read. The book is written in a turn of phrase that is relatively easily understood, which is a welcome change in terms of books connected with Kabbalah sometimes. \\"The Way of God\\" presents things in such a way that people can grasp the concepts with some degree of ease. At times, words specific to Kabbalah are used, though these are usually explained in some detail. Luzzatto rarely just assumes something. The book also contains both the Hebrew and English texts side by side.<br /><br />The book is also very logically and clearly set out in parts that are divided into a few chapters. The parts are:<br /><br />1. Fundamentals, covering The Creator, Man, Human Responsibility, and more.<br /><br />2. Providence, covering Providence in General, Individual Providence, How Providence Works, Israel and the Nations, and more.<br /><br />3. The Soul, Inspiration and Prophecy, with The Soul and Its Influence, Theurgy, The Prophetic Experience, Moses as a Prophet and more.<br /><br />4. Serving God, with Study of Torah, Love and Fear of God, Prayer, Seasonal Commandments, and more.<br /><br />Reading this book has also cleared up some issues that I have had from reading other books and been confused about. In this sense, I would agree with another reviewer that the book is \\"vital\\". It is indeed a worthy addition to someone seeking insight into Kabbalah.<br /><br />Some points I felt raised some questions and more issues that are difficult to resolve without further reading on my own part. One in particular is Luzzatto's teaching that nothing happens without God's knowledge or will on this earth, which made me ponder on how this impacts on the tragic history of the Holocaust. While I have not read any Jewish responses to this issue, the book certainly raises some interesting questions that are worth studying.<br /><br />Just lastly, if you are looking for a starting point in Kabbalah and Jewish thought, \\"The Way of God\\" is hard to go past. Despite the expense of getting it, it is worth the extra cost in being far superior to many other books that could leave you more confused. \\"The Way of God\\" really does get rid of a lot of the unnecessary complications.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book for both its informative discourse and also the inspiration that it presents to the reader.

US	28985175	R2JTL7KMRK40NO	0345384563	286200112	A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam	Books	5	14	15	N	N	Chewy Food for Thought	\\"In the beginning humans created a God who was the First Cause of all things and Ruler of heaven and earth.\\" So begins Karen Armstrong's major survey of the history and evolution of God. Covering the three monotheistic faiths, Armstrong draws parallels to the eastern faiths as well, (including Buddhism). She explores God through the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths, as well as delving into some of the different features that can be found within each.<br /><br />It is difficult to summarise such a large-scale book effectively and still do the book justice, so I will just give some highlights that I found particularly interesting and thought-provoking.<br /><br />The first chapter, (titled \\"In the Beginning...\\" aptly), sets the social and religious scene of Canaan at the time that Abraham was about to move into that region. This is done while posing the question \\"Who is Yahweh?\\", (pg 21). Interestingly, the title El Shaddai is also a traditional name for the Canaanite chief god and leads Armstrong to suggest that Abraham's God was actually El of the Canaanite pantheon. Tracing 4 different sources for the Pentateuch, (J, E, D, and P), the different concerns of each are brought out. Warning that we tend to project our own beliefs and understanding of God onto earlier figures like Moses and Abraham, Armstrong questions that their understanding of God was the same as each other, let alone the same as ours. Yahweh was a God that talked with people, showed up to dinner and gave helpful advice at this time. Even by the time of the later sources, Yahweh had evolved into something more remote and accessible only through an established priesthood. Other gods had \\"devolved\\" into mere illusions and nothingness, rather than being realities for other people groups. One last point that I found interesting is Armstrongs suggestion that Israel's worship of Asherah and Baal through history was a natural thing, seeing as gods were fairly territorial. Living in the area, it only made sense to appease and get the god of the area on your side. Armstrong puts a lot of the scriptural record into a more logical context, seeing the actions of people as understandable and logical conclusions of a set of presuppositions.<br /><br />Another area of interest was the development of Christ from an exalted human being to God in the early centuries of our era. Armstrong indicates that as later Gospels were written, the ideas about Jesus developed in greater and greater claims of who and what he was. After his death, Christians \\"could not abandon their faith that Jesus had somehow represented an image of God.\\" (pg 99) God had given him powers and so on, so when people saw him in action, they saw something of God. In the apotheosis of Christ, Armstrong draws some interesting parallels in the religions of Buddhism and Hinduism, and how these religions kept their figures more \\"accessible\\", (a result of this was the appearance of Buddhist statues in the 1st century BCE). An extension of this was the Buddhist idea of the bodhisattva, (1st century CE), which bears remarkable similarity to Jesus Christ in some circles. Armstrong also notes that the Incarnation was not finalised until the 4th century.<br /><br />Armstrong also highlights some contrasts between the Eastern Orthodox churches and the Western churches. While the West saw God as completely \\"other\\", with the resulting implications that came with it, the East had a view that allowed divinity as something that was accessible and available. They suggested that perfect humanity was achieved through union with the divine, according to Armstrong. This discussion of Armstrong's was very interesting for myself, highlighting that the western tradition was not the only one, and that in some points, most other Christian groups differed from it.<br /><br />These three areas particularly interested me, though Armstrong covers a huge range of aspects, including the development of the Trinity as a doctrine, and other aspects of Jewish mysticism, Muslim thought and so on.<br /><br />One very nice touch, I thought, was Armstrongs \\"Suggestions for Further Reading\\" list, which is broken down into chapters. So, for example, if you find the chapter \\"God of the Mystics\\" very interesting, you can find that section in \\"Suggestions for Further Reading\\". There you will find some useful books that concrentrate specifically on the area that interests you. This saves so much risk of buying a book that has 500 pages and only 1 page on the topic of your enquiry. I felt this was a very useful way of doing it, indeed. This encourages you to read further and develop a deeper level of knowledge for yourself. I really liked it.<br /><br />By way of concluding remarks, I have found this book to be in league with Karen Armstrong's usually high level of scholarship. She writes in a fluid and easy-going manner, while not sacrificing any attention to detail. The book is something you might not agree with on some points, but it will give you some very chewy food for thought. For an overview of God's \\"evolution\\", this is a great book. It will address some interesting issues and keep you rivetted until the end. You will not regret buying this book, whether you are religious or not.

Khathoey form what is almost a third gender identity, and they raise some interesting issues for gender identity overall.<br /><br />The book itself presents a mix of biographical sections, (about two khatoeys called Daeng and Lek), and sections on the wider issue of khatoey. The latter parts cover such issues Buddhism and khathoeys, the sex industry in Thailand, historical and modern khathoey as well as other information.<br /><br />Totman's access to the transgender community in Thailand is very unusual, and he has been able to gain access to very intimate facets of khatoey life that is denied most people. He has been able to observe people who do not have an easy life in Thailand, despite the overseas image of an open culture to them.<br /><br />With the biographical sections, the reader also gets to see and know the feelings, hopes, dreams and sometimes the harsh realities of life for khathoeys. These make the book all the more poignant.<br /><br />Finally, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as it gave an insight into a country and an aspect of it that one normal doesn't see outside cabaret bars. I enjoyed the book immensely, both as a well-written tome, but also as it allowed me to develop and grow in my own thinking. It doesn't not shove anything down your throat, but allows the reader to form their own ideas and thoughts. As a first book on a complex and emotive topic, this is a good one.	2005-04-06
US	28985175	R2IAM7VTDGTDG6	0631157565	525029101	History of Gnosticism	Books	4	24	25	N	N	Detailed Discussion	This book by Filoramo is fairly short, weighing in at 269 pages, (189 pages excluding notes, index and so on). In that short text, Filoramo manages to pack a huge amount of information and give the reader enough to think about for a long time.<br /><br />While the book describes the main and central ideas of Gnosticism, it gives a large amount of detail on each one. I honestly found some it hard to get my head around, and that is something I need to mention. I honestly feel that Jonas' and Rudolph's introductions, (\\"The Gnostic Religion\\" and \\"Gnosis\\" respectively), are easier for someone just looking for something to start with.<br /><br />However, the main positive side of this book, in my opinion, is that Filoramo devotes a lot of time connecting Gnosticism to the wider religious and social environment that it found itself in. He also devotes a significant amount of time dealing with those traditions that feed into Gnosticism. Should you be seeking to understand Gnosticism as a part of a wider context, this book does that admirably well. Filoramo seems to present Gnosticism, not as a surprising aberration, but as an understandable result of earlier religious and cultural ideas. In this, Filoramo has written a fine book that does not waste time in unnecessary words and rubbish.<br /><br />He also discusses briefly the history of scholarship in Gnosticism, which is fairly useful for putting his own book in a wider context.<br /><br />Another positive is the sheer amount of endnotes that Filoramo provides. For anyone who wishes to follow up on particular areas of his book, he has provided a large number of references for you to check. Also, he has provided a large bibliography for further reading, should you be interested. Filoramo also quotes extensive sections of the texts from the Nag Hammadi Library as well, which is awesome.<br /><br />One problem is that is some of the writing itself. The translator has used some pretty specialised words, which I did not know, and could not find in my dictionary. While this has happened only a few times, and does not effect the overall meaning so much, it did mean that I could not understand a few sentences. Also, some of the sentences are pretty long, using a lot of clauses in each one. This makes it hard, sometimes, to keep track of what the point is.<br /><br />A second issue that I have is that Filoramo makes some comments that are not sustainable from evidence about the status of Marcion as a Gnostic. Marcion has prompted debate as to whether he fits into the Gnostic tradition. Kurt Rudolph says that Marcion cannot be understood without Gnosticism and he rests firmly inside Gnosticism. While quoting Clement of Alexandria in support of his idea that Marcion's ascetism was not based on ethics, (whereas he claims Gnostic ascetism was), he attempts to show why Marcion cannot be a Gnostic. However, he ignores much evidence to the contrary, including sources from the same century as Marcion who clearly considered Marcion a Gnostic.<br /><br />That being said, the book is overall pretty good. I would still recommend Hans Jonas' [[ASIN:0807058017 The Gnostic Religion]] or Kurt Rudolph's [[ASIN:0060670185 Gnosis: The Nature and History of Gnosticism]] for an introduction to Gnostic belief over this book. However, this book is an excellent opportunity to view Gnosticism in its wider context, as part of a fermenting history of ideas and influences. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

It is both interesting from a historical perspective, taking in an event that was singularly fascinating, and deeply profound from a psychological perspective. It is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day.<br /><br />Hasekura is a deep character, and the reader spends a bit of time with Hasekura's thoughts. This is especially so as Hasekura confronts the emaciated, dying Christ that he sees on his travels toward Rome. The possibility of faith in this \\"pathetic man\\", and the conflict that produces with his duty to Lord and ancestors, forms a a deeply emotional narrative coupled with Hasekura's desires, dreams and simple wishes. The psychological aspect of the book is very well presented and notable in its impact.<br /><br />A notable part of the book is tied up with Father Velasco, whose ambition seems to know no limits. His own struggles with ambition, and the self-justifications that he employs, are a lesson worthy of remembering.<br /><br />This novel is a great one, and I was hooked to the very last page. It will take you into the world of Hasekura, Velasco and their companions, as they themselves see it. It will take you into their dreams, their hopes, their fatalism, their fears and their struggles to cope with their situation. I totally, unreservedly recommend this novel. I love this novel.<br /><br />A good follow on read is Endo's novel [[ASIN:0800871863 Silence]], which also deals with deep faith issues, this time from the perspective of a priest.	2005-04-02

I have just about no knowledge on Zen whatsoever, so this was a book that really introduced me to Zen from nothing. The style is easy to progress through, and Suzuki does not weigh you down with endless jargon that you need to learn.<br /><br />Suzuki covers a wide range of topics, including Swordsmanship, (a detailed 2 chapters on that), Samurai, Confuscian Study, Tea Ceremony and more.<br /><br />His references to sources, however, are far too few for my tastes. It would be nice to know where he is getting his information from, so that we might check up on and follow up his thinking. He does quote a lot of old poems, letters and works, and discusses them in detail. In one case, he offers a largely paraphrased offering, for which he explains he can't accurately translate the original words.<br /><br />On the other hand, he does offer a lot of extra information and explanation in footnotes. I have found these to be absolutely beneficial to the main text. They offer a little bit extra to help add to some interesting points, and they are generally fascinating and useful.<br /><br />I admit, in connection with Zen, I am a complete ignoramus. Now, I am a little less of an ignoramus. This book is excellent and informative. Some of the criticisms in other reviews did not register with me as I read the book. I just enjoyed it, to be honest. Suzuki is certainly not a dry writer, and captures you well in this book.	2005-04-01

The book takes you on a journey that borders on the insane into the world of a squadron of WW2 medium-level bombers. With a cast of interesting characters who each have some serious issues and choose some interesting ways to deal with them, this book takes you on a wild ride.<br /><br />The character dialogues are excellent, and convey much of the sense of impending insanity that seems to lurk just under the surface. Orr and his crab apples in his cheeks, (because they are better than horse chestnuts), is a good example of the mental instability that most characters seem to exhibit.<br /><br />The book is brilliantly written and it has a great flow to it. Different characters all add their own qualities to the mix, making for a combination of personalities that will leave you laughing in distrubed nervousness. Darkly comic, this book is a laugh and a deserved classic that is sure to endure for generations to come.	2005-03-31

He has avoided the extremes that an emotionally provocative subject as this usually inspires in some people. He has presented both sides of the conflict, or at least done so as good as anyone could expect, as well as pointing out the failures on both sides that have conspired to leave us with a seemingly hopeless situation today.<br /><br />For anyone looking for a broad introduction into the history, causes, contributing factors and personalities of the Arab-Zionist conflict, this book is hard to go past. It is comprehensive, well-written, well-referenced and very balanced in its presentation.<br /><br />Morris is a lively writer, and has struck a happy medium between detail and the need to keep on track in what is a complex subject.	2005-03-31

I had high hopes, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The book is arranged in essays, contributed by various philosophers from a variety of backgrounds. They are usually well-written, and cover a broad range of material with a healthy amount of quoting and reference back to the movie itself. Some covered similar themes, though each contributor brought something different to the mix.<br /><br />The only thing I found boring was the last essay. It was just not my style, and that is the only reason. This is the reason I did not give it a 5-star rating. I did not agree with some of the conclusions drawn, but I found these well presented and discussed.<br /><br />If you are a Matrix fan with an interest in philosophy, (but daunted by the language used in philosophy, like me), \\"The Matrix and Philosophy\\" is an excellent book. It is a great read, and it kept me hooked almost until the end.	2005-03-31

It is not about Gnosticism, as such, though the Gnostics do get discussed.<br /><br />The basic gist of the book is the contrast between the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of John, (the latter being the one in the NT). Part of Pagel's theory is that John's Christians were quite different to Thomas', and John was written in part to refute Thomas' Gospel.<br /><br />The book is in Pagels' usually accessible and flowing style, which makes her easily readable and absorbable. Pagels covers the material well, and presents her arguments well. In fact, I think she just may be on to something in her conclusions, though it is just a theory at the moment.<br /><br />One niggling point is her lack of endnotes or referencing in this book. Although she has endnotes, they seem a little sparse. On at least one occassion, she mentions \\"some scholars\\" in connection to one of her ideas. However, she provides no indication as to who those scholars might be, or where one might be able to view their work.<br /><br />Overall, I gave it a 4 because it is an easy book to read, and presents a fascinating take on the two Gospels under discussion. Pagels has written a fine book here, and it is worth anyone giving it a go. I totally loved it and gained a lot out of it.	2005-03-31

Even considering the dark nature of its subject material, the style is interminably monotonous. The authors were considered pre-eminent in their day and attempt to present a reasonably thorough defence of killing people. They also use numerous examples from cases that are known to them in order to demonstrate their points.<br /><br />The book presents a fairly cold and calculating side when dealing with the punishment of people. References to villages in which dozens of souls were executed are without emotion or the slightest tinge of regret.<br /><br />For people interested in the Medieval period and its fears, beliefs and the world that people saw around them, this book presents a unique insight into their mentality. It is also a testimony to the way in which religion can be used to justify even the most despicable treatment of human beings by people.<br /><br />At once fascinating and disturbing, this book is both special and vile. You won't feel good and there are no happy endings. However, the deepened knowledge and the lessons one can learn for today are worth the effort.	2005-03-31

I learned heaps from it!	2005-03-31
US	28985175	R3BHMNILXAU0X0	0380015390	52596332	The Satanic Bible	Books	4	14	19	N	N	Satanism Demystified	I would sort of compare LaVey to Rudolph Bultmann in some ways. He takes a lot of the myth out of Satanism, and avoids the cliched garbage that one can often find. If you are looking for weird magic, sex rites, sacrificial rituals, then keep searching. You won't find them in the \\"Satanic Bible\\".<br /><br />The book is short, and wastes nothing in its brevity. It is concise and straight to the point. On that note, LaVey pulls no punches and openly criticises people who enter a \\"herd mentality\\". Some of the content makes pretty good sense, actually, (refer the 11 Satanic Rules of the Earth). Although LaVey mentions magic, this is a very low-key element in the book.<br /><br />One might disagree with the content and details, (as I do), but I find myself admiring the spirit in which the book was written. Even if you have no intention of being a Satanist or anything like it, the book takes a refreshing look at life and spirituality from a different angle.<br /><br />It is a good read.	2005-03-31
US	28985175	RBIW5C1XK0KJQ	0807058017	489751212	The Gnostic Religion: The Message of the Alien God and the Beginnings of Christianity	Books	4	69	71	N	N	Still a Classic	I have heard from others that Jonas' book is less difficult to follow than Rudolph's book \\"Gnosis\\". I would agree with this assessment, in some ways. I found Jonas' book to be well organised and less \\"wordy\\" than that which Rudolph wrote.<br /><br />While Jonas does not cover as wide a range of types of Gnosticism, he does enter into greater detail. He uses Valentinian and Manichaean Gnosticism as examples of different streams of Gnostic thought. The detail into which he goes with the different elements of these schools is excellent, and is quite easily understood. He also covers the imagery and symbolism of Gnostic religion, as well as some on Marcion, Simon Magus and other topics.<br /><br />One drawback is the book's age, and it is a little dated. Here, Rudolph's book offers a more recent analysis with more of the Nag Hammadi Codices easily available than in Jonas' time. Despite this, Jonas still presents an excellent overview, and his book is rightly considered a classic in the field.<br /><br />Overall, the book is worth the money and worth the effort to read. It provides a sound basis and introduction to Gnosticism that is not too loaded with incomprehensible words and rubbish.<br /><br />If you know little to nothing about Gnosticism, start with Hans Jonas.	2005-03-30
US	28985175	R2TS2OFX6DUQI8	156931778X	419611869	Battle Royale	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Butchery and Mayhem	I had my first exposure to the \\"Battle Royale\\" franchise through the movie, which I went to see expecting a seriously violent bloodbath. In that, the movie did not disappoint. However, the added sense of dark humour also was a surprise.<br /><br />The book is also rather violent, and the detail is very graphic. However, the added information, depth of plot and also the characterisations seem to add something more. The characters in the book seem to be people you can connect with in many cases, (though not all). The action is fast paced and keeps you moving all through the story.<br /><br />On the downer side, I found some significant printing errors in the English version, (which annoyed me a little). Also, some parts seemed a little contrived, though I will not mention which parts. ;-)<br /><br />As a book, it can be enjoyed on a few different levels, from just a bloodbath to a deeper, critical work on human nature and other aspects of life. I just enjoyed a good read and was sorry to reach the end.	2005-03-30
US	28985175	R258RSACZZ88F	0440240948	817652979	Emperor: The Gates of Rome	Books	5	3	10	N	N	Adventure and Mayhem	\\"The Gates of Rome\\" is the first of a 4 volume series based on the life of Julius Caesar. This first installment takes in Caesar's early life, up to the civil war between his uncle Marius and Sulla, both great generals of the day.<br /><br />The style is lively and fast paced, even when nothing seems to be happening. Julius and Marcus are separated early in the book, and this serves to keep up the overall pace of the book. Very quickly, a small boy called Gaius becomes one of the nobilitas and is soon in the thick of Roman politics and intrigue, apprenticed to his uncle.<br /><br />Some have criticised Iggulden for being too liberal with the facts of Caesar's life and the events of those times. While this would be a fair comment in a history book, this is a novel, and was written to entertain. The historical notes at the end of the book serve to illuminate just what Iggulden added, (such as the fictional character Renius), and left out, (some of the details of the civil war).<br /><br />What \\"The Gates of Rome\\" is is a fine novel with loads of adventure and movement. This is a high-energy story that has kept this reader entranced to the very end. It is one of the few true page-turners I have read. And I have read it a couple of times, with no loss of interest on my part. I unreservedly endorse \\"The Gates of Rome\\" to anyone looking for a fantastic novel on the life of one of the great figures of history.	2005-03-30

I had heard of Ken Follet's books, and they seemed to enjoy a wide following.<br /><br />In \\"Hornet Flight\\", the setting in WW2 Denmark, the characters are well developed and the descriptions are well balanced between the detail and pace. Follet also keeps a reasonable level of tension thoughout the book.<br /><br />And then you reach the middle to the end. What would have been a difficult book even for someone of Follet's skills turns to unadulterated tragedy. The ending is predictable and a disaster, a thorough disappointment after a reasonably good build-up. It seemed shallow and without any real thought or climax. The delay of the flight, (this is after the two main characters slaved and scraped to repair the plane right under the Germans' noses), because of a dance performance was ...well....bad.<br /><br />Despite Follet's obvious skills as a writer, this book can't be among his best work. I would not reccommend it at all.	2005-03-30

Covering most of the major Gnostic phenomena, it covers a difficult topic in a way that is pretty easy to get into.<br /><br />Sometimes, it is a bit \\"wordy\\" and heavy going, though overall, it is an excellent intro.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed it.	2004-08-16
