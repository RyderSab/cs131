Great book!  :-)	Whether or not the Y2K Millenium Bug turns out to be a frightening fact or fabulous fizzle, emergency preparedness is a topic that everyone should investigate -- especially families with children at home.  You never know  when sudden financial down turns could make food purchasing difficult, or a  severe winter storm could keep your family confined to home for an extended  period of time, or even an earthquake could cause the need for emergency  essentials on hand. While I'm not sure what I personally feel about the  outcome of the Y2K computer problem, I do see the common sense idea of  family preparedness to be a good approach for anyone to seriously consider.   Having a well-stocked rotating pantry that's replenished from items  purchased in bulk and on sale is also a great way to save money on your  family's regular expenses (Y2K or not!).  I appreciated the author's  detailed list of suggestions for items to store ahead (whether you're  planning a storage system to last for one week, six months, or a full  year+).	1999-08-03

Is the author a mind reader?  How did she know exactly what my kitchen cupboards looked like?!  It was great to read a book that had me laughing (instead of crying!) about my personal organizational style.  I always  thought I was just an unorganized person since I could never get any of the  usual home organization systems to work for me (ie: notebooks, file cards,  etc.).  Nothing helped much, and sometimes just the attempt to get more  organized was often depressing.  Well, after reading this book, I feel I  have hope!  The author understood how my mind worked, helped me laugh at  myself (and my piles throughout the house!), and taught me that being  &quot;differently&quot; organized isn't wrong--just different.  If you've  tried EVERYTHING and nothing's worked, try reading (and applying) this  helpful and humorous book.	1999-07-26

For people interested in trying out the Nature Notebook or Nature Journal idea (it's a great activity for both children and adults), I highly recommend this book. Nature Journaling is written and illustrated by  college-level science educators who use Nature Journals as their primary  method of teaching people to learn about nature firsthand. A beautiful,  inspiring book!  I was first introduced to the idea of Nature Notebooks by  reading the works of Charlotte Mason, an educator in England during the  last century.  Taking regular Nature Walks and keeping individual Nature  Notebooks has been a happy and fulfilling family activity in our home for  several years.<br />After purchasing Nature Journaling, the book totally  changed the way our family approached our own Nature Journals -- this book  provided us with so many new ideas and creative uses for our notebooks. The  first day we read through the Nature Journaling book, my 12-year-old  daughter and I spent two hours at the local beaver pond sketching  red-winged blackbirds, Canada geese, rough-skinned newts, turtles, lily  pads and wildflowers. My husband has even decided to start keeping a Nature  Journal of his own after seeing the newly inspired work in my personal  Nature Notebook.  To anyone reading this review who has an active interest  in enjoying and learning about nature, I hope you'll seriously consider  adding a bit of nature journaling to your family's summertime activities.  You may even find yourself starting a rewarding and educational life-long  hobby.	1999-06-08

While simplifying your life is a popular topic right now, Jean Flemming takes it a step further in this book.  She says that the key to a successful Christian life doesn't lie in necessarily simplifying life, or  even finding balance, so much as it lies in finding focus and clear  priorities--and then living true to those ideals.  This is truly an  inspiring book.  Any Christian desiring a deeper, more intimate walk with  the Lord should read this book--and then read it again!<br />Here's a quote  from Flemming in the introduction to the book:  &quot;This book is for  Christians struggling to live Christlike lives in the midst of a whirlwind  of activities, demands, and responsibilities; for those seeking to develop  deeper, secret, inner lives while remaining intensely involved in our needy  world.  In answer to a search for a simpler lifestyle, I have found  focusing the Christian life, not simplifying it, to be the key.&quot;	1999-06-01

And if you haven't  read McCoy's first book, Miserly Moms, be sure to read it!

The first time I read one of the earlier Tightwad Gazette books, I surprised myself by immediately finding a savings in our family budget of $50 per month.  I was further inspired to try some other new money saving  ideas, and before too long our family was living well within our means and  actually climbed our way out of serious consumer debt -- COMPLETELY! <br />Of  course, I don't credit this book with all the personal hard work and  discipline that it took to reduce our family's consumer debt, BUT our goal  of being debt-free (inspite of a limited income due to lost earning  potential from an injury and chronic illness) wouldn't have happened as  quickly as it did without the inspiration and practical guidance found in  the pages of the Tightwad Gazette books and newsletter. <br />Many of the  ideas were a bit too &quot;out there&quot; for me personally, but there's  such a large quantity of information in this resource, that it's easy to  find things that WILL work for different individuals and their personal  situations.  While there's a good chance you won't want to start  stockpiling styrofoam meat trays (or go dumpster diving!), maybe you'll  discover some new tasty, simple (and VERY inexpensive!) recipes.  And  keeping a &quot;Price Book&quot; might be just the ticket to cutting down  regular expenses in your own family's financial situation.<br />The three  previous Tightwad Gazette books have been compiled into this single edition  with the addition of the last few issues of the Tighwad  Gazette newsletter  (those issues never made it into any of the previous books).	1999-04-12

Andy Dappen's book, &quot;Shattering the Two Income Myth,&quot;  critically examines the idea that two incomes are a requirement for family life in the modern world.  He draws some interesting conclusions.  Dappen  refers to a U.S. Labor Department study that has shown the average  dual-career family loses up to two-thirds of its second paycheck to  work-related expenses, and if children needing daycare or after school  supervision are in the picture, the percentage of work-related expenses is  even higher.  To truthfully calculate the earnings from a family's second  set of wages, they would need to subtract all work-related expenses from  their income.  Dappen asserts that many second income-earners are  &quot;spending big bucks for the privilege of joining the nine-to-five  parade.&quot; <BR><BR> Dappen also takes the view that one of the main  reasons people feel unable to live on a single income is due to inflated  expectations of what a family truly &quot;needs&quot; to live well.  He  calls it &quot;our love affair with consumerism.&quot;  Trophy houses,  sport utitlity vehicles, new mini vans, designer clothes, big screen TV's  and $100 running shoes are just some of the so-called &quot;needs&quot;  many parents are working to supply for their families. <BR><BR>  Dappen  encourages a change of attitude---a refocusing to a mindset that embraces  contentedness and fullfillment rather than following after consumer-driven  forces.  Dappen says, &quot;Making your life happier, more directed, and  less stressful distills down to the acceptance of five simple words:  You  can't have it all.&quot; <BR><BR> &quot;Shattering the Two Income  Myth&quot; would be an ideal book for any family contemplating the change  from two incomes to a single income situation.  The book offers practical  suggestions for preparing for, and actually making the switch to, living on  one income.  There are also numerous personal inventory questions to help  with the decision making process.	1998-11-20
