Comedy is okay, but I prefer the type of stuff that makes you cry, either with sympathy and heartache or with joy. This is one that has you cheering at the end. <br /> <br />The characters are very real, believable, and most importantly, likable. The mature content is done in a tasteful, fun way, and the interactions of the characters are great. Aine and Sakuya are perfect together, and although the story moves kind of fast, it is written in such a way as to be totally believable. When they end up together at the end of the first book, there is nothing odd about it, because the way the story was handled makes it entirely plausible. And you are not drowning in sap and waff. <br /> <br />The art of this series is amazing! It is so detailed, and so pretty--I just can't stop looking at it.  <br /> <br />So. Visually pleasing, great characters, terrific storyline... what are you waiting for?	2004-10-20

This books is a marvelous help in getting the feel of the place and period with which I am working. I don't know how I could get along without this book!<br />It presents its information in a clear, concise manner that is easy for me to understand, and the pictures really give you a feel not just for the house, but for the mindset of the people who live there. I recommend this book to anyone studying the Japanese culture.	2004-04-08

Miyuki's trip through the various worlds is nothing short of erotic. She never meets any guys, just females intent on exploring her and each other. So yes, there is a somewhat lesbian tone to all of this.<br />As always, the art is totally awesome, but unless you are a fan of semi-erotic stuff, I advise you to not get this book.	2004-03-04
US	32679523	R2ND0PY6YCJ57C	0312875592	412138995	The Fox Woman	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Kitsune, love, and magic...	This is a wonderfully poetic novel that is told in diary format from three sources; the fox girl, the man she loves, and his wife. All three have their own lives outside of each other, and that shows in the way that they deal with others. But at the same time they are inexplicably tied together, and the way that Kij Johnson handled this is superb. She doesn't rush into the triangle, but glides into it,a nd before long you are at that point without realizing it.<br />The characters undergo drastic changes through the course of the story, though some changes are more noticeable than others. The fox starts out as a just a fox, but gradually she not only physically morphs into a human, but becomes one mentally and emotionally. This transformation threatens to destroy her small family as she pulls them into her fantasy.<br />The man has a fascination with the foxes that is sending him further and further away from his wife. When he meets the fox-girl, he is overwhelmed by her spell and falls for her.<br />His wife has to deal with his increasing interest in the foxes and his waning interest with her, and this eventually sends her away from their country home and back to the city.<br />This is a story of love, magic, and in many ways, of loss. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in some of the lesser known stories of Japan (upon which this is somewhat based), and to all who enjoy a good love story!	2004-03-04

I read the Maico 2010 series before I read this, and that may have tainted my judgment somewhat. But to me, this series is nothing new, and not as interesting as Maico was to me. Kurumi feels rushed, like the author was trying to put it out before the deadline and didn't bother to really concentrate on it. So much more could have been done with it, especially once the sister angels arrived. The premise is much like Maico, Oh My Goddess, or AI Love You in that a young, inhuman girl (a robot) falls for the first man she sees and pledges to be with him and protect him forever. That plotline has been overdone. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing--I love Maico and Oh My Goddess, and I DID buy Steel Angel Kurumi. But I found that Kurumi has too many unaddressed issues and a rushed plot, so it failed to grab my attention for long.	2004-03-04

Characters are named after sweets, and their base is a pastry cafe built to look like a tiered wedding cake. They attack with bells and batons, and their enemies are mice, sparrows, and other everyday animals that aliens have injected with something to make them big. And the preteen love story is there in its entirety.<br />This is a cute series, but don't read it if you have an allergy to cute.	2004-03-04

We all know that Ranma dislikes his female form, except when he can use it to get free food or something. But still--cheerleading? This is yet another activity that has gained a martial twist from Rumiko Takahashi, and it works out rather well. And Ranma-chan does look good in that outfit.<br />Have you ever wondered why Ranma and his dad are traversing the world by themselves? Where is Ranma's mother? Turns out that she is looking for her son and husband. They stopped writing to her just before the visited the springs of Jusenkyo, and she is curious why.

First off, I have read Samurai Deeper Kyo and Rurouni Kenshin. So for those of you that want to flame me, I do know what I am talking about.<br />I was not very impressed with this book. The characters are sterotypes, the plot has been done before (Kenshin) and the dialogue was, while good, not enough to separate it from the pack.<br />Overall, I prefer Rurouni Kenshin to this.	2003-10-29

I had heard that this was a little like Gundam, a little like Five Star Stories(Which is the best manga I've ever read in English, by the way), and a little bit Escaflowne. All I have to say to that rumor is...no, it isn't. This is very different. The Brain Powereds and Grand Chers are sentient beings, not machines. Their partners do not control them, but merely help guide them. And they cannot change into other things, like a certain robot that can become a dragon.<br />Anyway, this is a very good series. I like the plot, and the characters are different. But this is not one of my favorites.	2003-07-30

See, Kuno goes there to train for his next fight with Ranma, and comes for his opponent wearing a watermelon on his head. And he has amnesia. He gets Ranko (Ranma's female side) to the island, where she is knocked unconscious. She has a very funny dream too!

Like the first volume of this wonderful series, this one is filled with sap, romance, and some of the goofiest, sweetest stuff ever put down on paper. The characters are beautifully drawn, the story makes a sort of sense, and the costumes are majorly cool. But this is not for those with a hankering for violence, horror elements, or anything like that. But if you want cute and fuzzy, then get these books!	2003-07-30

I devoured them and moved onto some others, and I am looking forward to reading &quot;Flesh Colored Horror&quot; and some other real horror manga.<br />&quot;Uzumaki&quot; did what Tomie could not--keep me up at night. But seeing as how I have panic attacks and insomnia, that is probably not a good thing. I love the horror genre, but I need to stop reading them after a certain point. Anyway, if you are looking for something to keep you up nights, then you should take a long look at &quot;Uzumaki&quot;. <br />Both &quot;Tomie&quot; and &quot;Uzumaki&quot; made me think about the story and how it can apply to the world around me; they both got me to notice things I would not have otherwise seen; both kept me is suspense and made me read them all the way through (without pausing); and both are very well-drawn, and the pictures are not very crowded.<br />So, although &quot;Uzumaki&quot; didn't have quite the same effect on me that &quot;Tomie&quot; did, I still recommend it to anyone and everyone interested in horror manga.	2003-04-22

Truth to tell, I didn't like this volume as much as I did the others. It introduced too many new characters in too short a time for me to really connect with any one of them, and the plot seemed to stray from what it started as. But it wasn't a total loss. It was a fun trip and a new take on the world of Real Bout High School. The regular characters are still pretty cool and interesting to read about, and the art is still top-notch.<br />So, fans of Real Bout, you should read this one! And if you aren't a fan, I'd suggest you start with the earlier books, otherwise you will be lost.	2003-04-16

But the Demon World Police are after De-mo for coming to the Human World, and they intend to punish him. Aimi refuses to let them kill her friend, and volunteers to recapture a group of magical demon stones, each with an Arch-Demon sealed inside. The Police agree, and the pair of thieves get to work.

Deeply symbolic, nearly every person, object, and incident means something else on a higher level in addition to the face value. The characters are not just human--they *represent* humanity, both good and bad. They highlight our weaknesses and emphasize our strengths. In this world, power means everything and concepts such as friendship, devotion, and love mean almost nothing. In the pursuit of power and prestige, families and friends are sacrificed for desires. And the life and happiness of one girl are bound to the power to change the world.<br />This is a controversial series dealing with life, death, change, love, betrayal, belief, truth, and more material concepts such as sex, attraction, and adventure. It messes with your reality, rights it, then scrambles it up again.<br />For those prudes and parents out there, be forewarned--this does contain incest (love between brother and sister), rape (can you call it that?--Anthy doesn't fight when it happens to her), and lesbianism. That's not to say that it is a bad series--just be warned that their are some controversial themes recurring in the story.<br />Read this manga or watch the TV show or watch the movie--you will never look at anime or manga the same way again!	2003-04-15

I have liked GE 999 ever since I started readng it in Animerica magazine. So, I got this book, but discovered that this is actually the *sequel* to the *first* adventure of Maetel and Tetsuro. I got this information from the biographies of the characters and the clues in the story. As a result of not havign read the first series, I am a tad bit lost. Can someone tell me WHY they chose to publish the sequel in English before they translated the first series? It doesn't make any sense!<br />Anyway, the characters are fun and I enjoy their adventures. But the blurb at the end of every chapter is too deep and confusing for me to understand.<br />I like this, and I will look up the first series--right after I find out who started this translating mess in the first place.	2003-04-15

Volume 1 started the ball rolling, Volume 2 introduced a new character and showed us a little about why Sugita wants Maico dead or alive, and volume 4 ends the story. This volume just seemed to be a filler. The games of Strip Mah-johng, the scenes with Masudamasu reminiscing in her uniform, and the fight with the ant and the android just seemed to be fanservice and have no real bearing on the plot itself. Frankly, I feel as though Toshimitsu Shimizu could have skipped this book and just done a three book Maico series.	2003-04-15

It was once said that Masaharu Katsura's girls were to die for. After reading Shadow Lady and Video Girl Ai, I can agree with that. His work features some of the most beautiful art I've ever seen, and his storytelling is second to none. His characters are all human with human emotions and reactions. And Ai is one of the most human of them all, even though she is a Video Girl. (The way she reacts when her body changes is great!)<br />This is an excellent series and is worth your time and money.	2003-04-14

This is one of the most beautifully done manga I've seen, but that is all it has going for it in my eyes. The characters are shallow and superficial.

After the incredible end of the first story arc, we come back to the world of Cephiro.

I'm sure everyone has heard of Card Captor Sakura (or Cardcaptors, as it is known in the United States). Well, this is the manga that started it all. Whereas the TV series shows us how she opened the book and got the job, here that first adventure is seen only in a brief flashback. And she does not face off with the cards in the same order that she does in the anime. That may have something to do with the fact that there are only about a third of the cards featured in the manga than are in the show and movie. <br />A good series that was made into an exceptional TV series (until it was butchered by the US and our critics).	2003-04-14

Not because it has nudity (it has some) or gore (none shown, but implied), but because it is so hard to understand. The plot moves at a fast pace, characters are introduced and then leave, and the action is minimal. But for those of you willing to tough it out, then it is well worth it. Truly one of the more intellectually stimulating manga series out there.	2003-04-14

He is not doing this for the 'good of the planet Earth'--he's doing it to feel like a hero and boost his ego. When approached by the beautiful android Isaka, he tries to make out with her. He is unpopular at school because of his grandfather's opinions on the aliens, and the fact that he shares them. Of course, when the aliens turn on humanity, Hoichi and his grandfather are suddenly very popular.<br />If you are looking for beautiful girls and powerful mecha, then look no further. Busty young ladies abound in this series, and Isaka's sexiness even serves a real, logical purpose. And the Exaxxion is right up there with the Gundams and Escaflowne in mecha goodness!<br />I reccommend this to any fan of Gundam, Macross, or Escaflowne. I think you'll like it!	2003-04-14

Felicia and Morrigan are two of my favorite characters, and they are featured prominently in this book. We also get to know the vampire lord Demitri Maximoff, the werewolf Jon Talbain, the zombie Lord Raptor, and the Vampire Hunter Donovan. There are hints that Demitri and Morrigan are attracted to each other, as well as suggestions of deeper feelings between Jon and Felicia (at least that's what I am reading between the lines).<br />The art is simply gorgeous, and the characters and their troubles evoke powerful feelings from the reader. The story around each character is a deep and interesting one.<br />If you have ever played the games or watch the anime, then I suggest you give this a try. Maybe you'll like it as much as I did!	2003-04-14

I love the art in this book--it's elegant, clear, and nicely done. The story however, needs work. I have the first two books, and I have yet to understand most of what they are talking about. What are the Emblem Seeds? They tell us where they found them, but not what they are. We have yet to learn the connection between the Seeds and their holders, or what the purpose of the Seeds is. And the wording is so...unusual...that it is taking me some time and several re-readings just to try and figure out what the author is trying to say.<br />By the way, this is a very...adult series. There is not really any nudity, but the female characters are so overendowed that you begin to wonder how they can stand. And there is gore--one of the female characters gets blown in half, and her...resurrection is shown in very bloody and graphic detail.<BR>So, this is not a series for the fragile. If you think you can deal with seeing body parts ripped off and people cut in two and a great deal of blood and organs, then give Seraphic Feather a try. If not, well, there are other choices out there.<br />This looks to be a good series, but I would rather know some vital information that I think I missed somewhere. And I wish I had known about the horror aspect.	2003-04-14

But it just didn't grab me the way that Ranma 1/2, Urusei Yatsura, and Maison Ikkoku did.    For one thing, I noticed a lot of similarities between the characters of Inu Yasha and some of the author's earlier series.  Inu Yasha is a lot like boy-type Ranma--arrogant, loud, easily irritated, and has problems with females. Kagome is in turn much like Akane--easily offended, not willing to listen to reason occasionally, and stuck with a boy she can hardly stand. Miroku is a younger version of Happosai, and Sango shares traits with Ukyo from Ranma 1/2, including a preference for outrageously big utensils/weapons.    This does not mean that these are carbon copies of the older characters; each one of the characters in Inu Yasha has a charm and style all their own. And the plot is interesting.    The bottom line is, go ahead and get this book if you want. Just because I don't absolutely adore doesn't mean it's not worth a look.    By the way, I had the same problem with this book that I had with the first two books of Ranma 1/2. The pictures are too dark, like it was run through a copier without being cleared up before it was bound together in the book. Be warned.	2003-04-14

Now, I know that some things need to be kept secret until the end or it will spoil the story, but this is too much. I feel as though I have been dropped into the middle of the story. There is no background on any of the characters or the Emblem Seeds, or even the reason why people have moved to the moon in the first place! I would like to know how the characters know each other and exactly what is so special about the Emblem Seeds, but neither this volume nor the next contain that information.<br />Be warned--there is some nudity (not much) and gore (buckets full) so you might want to consider something else if you are not mature enough to handle this kind of stuff.	2003-04-14

We won't even get into Ataru and his crowd from Urusei Yatsura. Inu Yasha has provided us with some new examples of those who speak their mind and constantly make you hang your head and sigh. <br />While not as boisterous and arrogant as Inu Yasha, the Buddhist monk Miroku shares some traits with the dog-demon. Both tend to say what they think, regardless of the consequences. Both are stubborn as mules and as dense as rocks.

In the first book we were introduced to a trio of Tokyo schoolgirls summoned to a world of will to save a princess. We continue their adventures in this book. Ascot arrives after Alycone falls, and Umi gains something important. They also get their weapons!<br />A must for any collector of manga, CLAMP fan or not!	2003-04-14

I normally don't like stories about ordinary people, but this sounded interesting. I'm not sorry I picked it up and read it, but it is not one of my favorites.<br />If you're into telepathy or telekinesis, then get this book.

Naomi accidentally kills hundreds of civilians in a horrific airplane crash and is sentenced to 1000 years. She works for as an airborne assassin for an organization that is blackmailing her by threatening to harm her invalid brother or beloved boyfriend. So, she continues to fight, but with each strike she feels less like a human and more like a monster. But can she escape this life of murder and pain...?<br />Not for children, this book has several scenes where Naomi and her boyfriend are making love, or just pictures of her nude. And the adult themes of regret, jealousy, hatred, anger, and despair would be hard for younger audiences to understand. The action moves fast and the dogfights are spectatular, but short.<br />I loved Maico and I like this one! Bring more of his work into the English repertoire!	2003-04-14

We've all heard stories of vengeful girlfriends and the ladies that you shouldn't get to know. But Tomie--Tomie is all of that and more. She possesses men with a glance, capturing their souls so completely that they cannot live without her. They are also compelled to kill classmates, friends, themselves, and even Tomie. But she always comes back...<br />This is a frightening and disturbing manga. It has a lot of gore,but that is not what makes it so interesting and scary; the story and ideas behind the artwork do most of the job. The art is beautiful in a macabre way.<br />So, the bottom line is that if you are thinking of getting into horror manga, then you should seriously consider getting this book.	2003-04-09

Lum and Ataru may be the stars of the Urusei Yatsura universe, but the supporting characters play an even bigger role. Mendo is to Ataru what Kuno is to Ranma-a rich playboy who wants the heroine so badly he'll sink to any level to get her. Shinobu is the long-suffering girlfriend of Ataru, who actually befriends her romantic rival Lum later in the series. Lum's younger cousin (Jari)Ten lives to make Ataru's life even more miserable than it was to start with. Lum's childhood friend Ran wants revenge on her for accidents that happened when they were young. The monk Cherry and his niece Sakura are constantly trying to exorcise Ataru, and his parents are always moaning about how he should never have been born.<br />But in this first collection, we meet a trio of ladies that are not interested in ruining Ataru's life. Benten is one of the Cosmic gods and her people wage a yearly battle with the Oni. Ataru (like always) approaches her in his own fashion, right in front of Lum. And Benten even flirts back!<br />Oyuki is the Snow Princess of the planet Neptune, and she meets Ataru and his friends when she has her subjects dump several tons of snow into Ataru's bedroom (not on purpose--the computer chose the spot). Her servant takes an instant dislike to Ataru and soon the boy is running for his life, much to the chagrin of the Princess, who actually wanted to get to know Ataru better.<br />Kurama wants nothing to do with Ataru, but due to a mistake made by one of her people, she is forced to deal with the boy. So, she proceeds to try and reform him, which doesn't work (who thought it would?)<br />These are all wonderful characters that don't get as much press as Lum and the others. They deserve recognition too!<br />So, get the Perfect Collection! You'll like it, Takahashi fan or not!	2003-04-09

See, aliens have invaded and are using animals to attack humans. In an effot to protect the planet, an organization decides to fight back using endangered animals. But at a critical moment five beautiful teenage girls are injected with the DNA of the endangered animals. So, these ladies become the saviors of our world.<br />Now, I know you're thinking \\"Sailor Moon\\", but it's not really like Sailor Moon. What's different? Well, for one thing, Tokyo Mew Mew is much cheesier and goofier. The main heroine (who has the genes of a cat) summons her weapon by shouting \\"Sutoru Bell Bell!\\" A giant heart shaped bell appears in her hands, and she attacks the enemy with some equally goofy attack. The weapons of the other girls are just as adorable, and just as unbelievably effective.<br />This is not for diabetics and people who are easily nauseated. The speeches are even sappier than those in Sailor Moon, and the attacks are even...stranger. And instead of fighting real monsters (like the Sailor Soldiers *occasionally* do), the characters in Tokyo Mew Mew are fighting against ten foot mice and hordes of sparrows. (How scary...*yawn*)<br />Don't get me wrong--it's a cute series and I like the first book. I'm just warning you; the sappiness and cuteness is at an all-time high in this series. If that's your thing, then by all means, get the books. If it's not...well, there's a wide variety of manga for you to choose from.<br />Did I mention that the characters are named after sweets and that their home base is a cafe shaped like a castle from Candyland?	2003-04-09

And like Rumiko Takahashi's \\"Mermaid Saga\\", \\"Ceres\\" gives us another take on the stories of legendary beings, in this case, angels. And like with Takahashi's mermaids, there is a price to be paid for approaching an angel--and angering her. <br />Beautifully done, \\"Ceres\\" is a macabre story about betrayal, hatred, love, and familial relations. Power is sought and protected, but at the lives and emotions of the children of the family. Girls are murdered by their own families when it is discovered that they have the power of the angels, but one girl escapes. Now she is hunted by her relatives, and her friends are in danger. Her twin brother is being set up against her, and the man she loves is one of the ones that has been sent to kill her. Aya Mikage's life has just entered the realm of the bizarre, and she may never recover.<br />The characters are likable, the story is believable, and Watase manages to explain a good portion of the genetic details in a way that I can understand. There are parts that made me scratch my head, but overall she does a good job. The only complaint I have is that the love scenes in her books are rushed. Aya and Toya were practically making love by the second book, and Yuhi goes from 'I REALLY don't want to spend time around her' to 'I love you Aya! Let's go on a date right now!' I had the same problem with how quickly Tamahome and Miaka fell for each other. The characters need to get to know a tad bit more than each others' names before they start planning the wedding.<br />Other than that (very) slight objection, I love the \\"Ceres\\" books and am waiting with baited breath for the rest of the books to come out.	2003-04-09

Ryoga fights with an incredibly heavy umbrella, Azusa and Sanzenin fight and figure skate at the same time, Kodachi uses the tools of rhythmic gymnastics to beat up her opponents, and who could forget the take out race? Well, here's another one to add to the list--fighting with Japanese pizza!<br />Yep, you heard me. Ukyo Kuonji fights with a special batter that acts like glue, and rubber yakisoba noodles that wind around the opponent, and tempura flakes mixed with gunpowder, and flour bombs. The preferred weapon is a giant spatula, which stands taller than a person, although Ukyo also uses small spatulas almost like ninja stars.<br />More proof that the mind of Rumiko Takahashi must be a very interesting place!<br />Get this and read it!

I loved the Ghost In The Shell movie, and I like the manga, but the movie is better in my opinion. The manga is filled with technobabble that is hard for me to understand, and it is difficult to tell where the action starts and stops, in regards to fight scenes. None of the characters really reached out and grabbed me, not even the Major. But some of the illustrations were in color, and that is a big bonus.<br />All in all, an okay book, but definitely not one of the favorites of my collection.	2003-04-04

I won't review the story since others have done it for me. What I will do is talk about the design of the book itself.    For one, the binding on all of the Urusei Yatsura/Lum books is substandard. My copy of 'The Return of Lum' has the cover coming off of it, from the binding, like it's just peeling up. 'The Perfect Collection' is losing pages in the center of the book, and I have to replace my copy of 'Sweet Revenge' because it has lost EVERY SINGLE PAGE in it! There is just no excuse for this! I'm afraid to touch 'Trouble Times Ten' or 'Ran Attacks' for fear that they will come apart too!    I'm not saying that you shouldn't get the books; this is a wonderful series and everyone should read it, Takahashi fan or not. But just be warned that the books will fall to pieces on you.	2003-04-04

The binding is weak, making the cover separate from the book. And the printing is horrible! The pages look like they were sent through a copier without Edge Erase put on it.

I prefer the 'Perfect Collection', since it features Benten, Kurama, and Oyuki, who happen to be my favorite characters. Lum is cool too, but the above-mentioned catch more of my interest.

After all that Mara has been through with the goddesses--charm allergies, amnesia, the Lord of Terror, other demons--you'd think she'd eventually give up on attacking them. Well, no one ever accused Mara of having a brain, or common sense. She's come back with a genie-like demon named Senbei, who shows up again in the \\"Devil In Miss Urd\\" arc. Needless to say, this doesn't do anything to stop the goddesses, and Mara and her accomplice are once again defeated.<br />Banpei enters, and causes problems for everyone in the household except for Belldandy, with whom he has fallen madly in love. This is a cute story, but it makes you feel kinda sorry for Keiichi and the oldest and youngest goddesses.<br />Every fan of OMG should have this book in their collection. So buy it!	2003-03-19

I own almost all of the books and have written a multitude of fanfiction about it. True, I like some of the books more than others, but that is another story.<br />I am not going to review the story, since others have done that for me. Instead, I'm going to critique the design of the book itself. The art is excellent, as with all of Takahashi-san's work, but the problem is that it is too dark. You know how some copiers print out pages that are covered in black splotches or just too dark and fuzzy to read clearly? Well, that is the problem with the first and second books of Ranma. It is nearly impossible in some areas of the story for me to see the pictures--almost as if someone had put it through a copier and forget to put Edge Erase on.<br />But that is my ONLY complaint with this book, and the second volume. This little distraction is cleared up after the second book.<br />Go ahead and get the books, but be warned that some of the pictures are hard to see.	2003-03-19

Instead, the lovebugs spout romantic nonsense at each other and Kodama makes a decision.

I liked Juline, although I must say I prefer Ranma 1/2 for martial arts manga. This is the sequel to Juline--and a very good sequel it is.<br />Juline has to look for her sisters (ones she never knew she had), but that is not going to be as easy as she thinks. And one of the sisters is hiding something from Juline...<br />The art is hard to follow sometimes, but it is still beautiful. Like Vampire Princess Miyu, Vampire Yui, and Juline, the art is flowing, gentle, and has very few defining lines.<br />The story is intriguing, although not entirely original. But that does not hamper the story in any way. It is a fresh take on the oft-used &quot;hero/heroine goes looking for long last family&quot; plot, which is even more interesting since Juline was basically &quot;find and protect the three treasures that have the ability to destroy the planet&quot; thing.<br />All in all, a very good read and a worthy addition to any manga collection.	2003-03-19

The plot is fairly original, and those parts that are not original are played in a fresh, new way. The characters are all well-done, from hyperactive Kaolla to stern Motoki to Naru of the crazy mood swings. Keitaro is charming in his own goofy, stupid little way. <br />This manga is full of misunderstandings, hijinks, romantic mishaps, and drops in courtesy and decency.

The art, while not as detailed as Magic Knight Rayearth or X/1999, is still beautiful. The story is meant to be lighthearted and funny,although there are deeper emotions running under the surface.<br />If you are offended by a couple of cuss words and suggestions of an erotic nature, as well as slightly erotic pictures, then this is not for you. That is not to say that this is a pornography or hentai manga. It's just that a good portion of the story deals with mature, sexual themes.<br />All in all, if you are looking with a good story with nice artwork, lovable characters, and a bit of an older theme, then this is the manga for you.	2003-03-18

It is funny, sweet, and a little naughty all at once. (not naughty in the sense of Chobits, and only in one scene. Mizuho never actually does anything to Kei, she just talks about it.) The characters are lovable and (in some cases) totally human. <br />Parts of the book caught my interest a little more than others. Like when Mizuho and Kei are put into their...situation, and when Misuho's family comes to pay their respects. Other parts weren't as compelling, like the beginning of the book. But to each their own, and it is needed to set up the story.<br />If you liked Chobits or Oh My Goddess or Tenchi Muyo, then you will like this manga.	2003-03-10

But now, thanks to the wonderful people who printed this English language version, I can now read the story that I have admired for so long! <br />The art is superb, the story is exciting, and the characters draw you in and hold you there. I like how Mamoru Nagano has mixed the mythology of various countries and combined them with the technological driven dreams of our time. He has put an interesting spin on a cliche'd situation, and that is great! Kudos to you!<br />It may be hard to understand at first, but once you get into it, it's great!<br />I would love to be able to describe the plot to you, but I'm not sure I can remember that much of it. That's not to say that it lacks a plot--my memory is just incredibly bad.<br />Anyway, try it for yourself!
