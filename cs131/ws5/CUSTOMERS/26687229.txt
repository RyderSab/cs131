As a graphic design student at Brigham Young University I was introduced to U&lc, \\"The International Journal of Typographics.\\" I came to anticipate the arrival of each issue, packed not only with the latest type fonts from International Typeface Corporation, but with interesting articles about subjects ranging from the Chinese zodiac to wines and cheeses. U&lc was fun and featured examples of cutting-edge typography by some of the world's greatest graphic designers.<br /><br />Little wonder that, as related by author/editor John D. Berry in the book U&LC: INFLUENCING DESIGN & TYPOGRAPHY, I am one of those who kept a stack of yellowing back issues of this marvelous publication. I have consulted them again and again over the years that I have been a practicing designer and just to look back at some of the best editorial work ever produced.<br /><br />Being a huge fan of U&lc I was absolutely thrilled to hear about Berry's book.<br /><br />When I received the book I was not disappointed in the least.  There before me was an anthology of U&lc, complete with actual pages from several issues, copies of cover art for every issue and, most importantly, the feeling, verve and spirit of the original publication. Additionally, the book presents essays about how U&lc came to be and evolved over the years that it was in print publication.<br /><br />U&lc, the journal, is no longer a printed publication, being replaced by a terrific online publication. But this new book should be a must for any serious student of graphic design.  Believe me when I say that the typography featured in this book can and will inspire anyone currently involved in perfecting his craft as a designer.  Moreover, if you are interested in what it takes to design a beautiful page in a book, magazine or anywhere type is used, pick up this book. Great stuff!<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN	2005-09-24

PORK ANYONE!<br /><br />THE SINISTER PIG by Tony Hillerman combines all of that you have come to expect from a classic Hillerman mystery.  It's all there: murder, intrigue, ominous messages from \\"The Man,\\" political maneuvering and corruption. And, as usual, it's all set against the sweeping panoramas of the American Southwest, as vivid in Hillerman's descriptions as in a Maynard Dixon painting.<br /><br />Chee and Leaphorn are at there very best when a body turns up in their jurisdiction.  Step by step, the pair untangle the deftly woven webs of deceit placed carefully to ensnare the curious while covering up one of the slickest crimes the two have ever encountered. Bernie Manuelito and Cowboy Dashee are along for the rollicking ride!<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN	2005-08-30

I had gone there to try and make sense of the exhaustive array of bits that are available. Then I saw this book. They had it prominently displayed among a group of Western bits.  The sales clerk spoke glowingly about it to another customer.  Accordingly, I determined to add it to my library.<br /><br />What I discovered was a book that falls considerably short of the report I had heard in the tack shop.  Not to mention the fact that it is written primarily for English Style riding. After a careful reading I find that there is really only one answer, at least according Hilary Vernon, when it comes to Bits and Bitting: there is no answer.  It speaks in generalities and adds to bitting confusion by displaying photos of more bits than you can shake a stick at. In truth, I gained more useful information about the subject in a brochure from the Myler Bits company and from the bits pages found in my Smith Brothers tack catalog.<br /><br />What had I hoped for?  I had hoped for a book that described the characteristics of horses and then recommended possible bitting solutions.  I recognize that horses are as different in personality and temperament as people are but some advice on getting started would have been helpful.  It would have been considerably more than what the book contained.<br /><br />Then there's price.  This book, page for page, is one of the most expensive volumes that I have ever encountered.  I rationalized that for such a high price it surely had to be good.  Not nearly! Save your money and get more information for free from a good tack catalog or Myler Bits brochure.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN	2005-07-28

Just as soon as I am sure that I am headed in the \\"right\\" direction I stop, hesitate and begin to qualify something that I just explained.  Why? Because, try as I might, there is just no way to take a streamlined course in explaining the intricacies of one of the most topsy-turvy episodes in Western history.<br /><br />I've read with interest some of the other reviews of this great work and find words like \\"jumbled,\\" \\"rambling\\" and \\"tangential.\\" Interestingly, these words characterize any intelligent discussion or investigation of the \\"facts\\" about Custer, his life and his storied death in Montana in June of 1876.  This story simply cannot be told in a straight line. Unlike the Titanic disaster, we are unable to plot the course of the line from its port (in the case of Custer, no one defined place) to disaster.  The story, like Connell's narrative, weaves back and forth and back again.  And just when you think you got it licked a whole new set of challenging, often conflicting \\"facts\\" arise to muddy things up.<br /><br />The thing that's nice about Connell's book is that it makes no heroic attempt to say, finally, \\"I've found the irrefutable truth at last!\\"  Revisionist historians can make as many absurd attempts as they like to close the case on Custer.  They can wander the hills and valleys of the Little Bighorn again and again, hoping to tap some new psychic wave that links the present with the past. The only fact that remains is that it's been just too many years, the bones have long ago been scattered and there's no going back and climbing into the head of one of the most enigmatic and controversial figures in Western lore.<br /><br />A rambling, chaotic, jumbled narrative? Nothing suits the telling of this story better! In fact I believe it adds an element of emotion that must have existed in the dark days just following the event itself in 1876.<br /><br />The debate will rage on. And, very likely, such a continuing heated discussion would probably please the General very much. Connell's masterpiece, in my opinion, comes as close to providing as much fact, truth and fairness -- regarding everyone and everything involved -- as I have found anywhere.<br /><br />THE HORSEMANllowing the event itself in 1876.

HORSES FOR DUMMIES does an excellent job of introducing the horse lover to the ins and outs of horses and horse ownership. The book paints a fairly accurate picture of all that is involved in getting started, covering the gamut of gadgets and tack necessary, a variety of veterinary issues, housing, feeding, training...you name it. A good, sound preliminary overview.<br /><br />The one drawback to the book is that the authors go way overboard with trying to help the reader assess whether horse ownership is a realistic option. It seemed to me that they had perhaps seen some severe situations where people bought horses that really shouldn't have and they then vented their frustrations into this book. As a result they, in some cases, use a sledgehammer to swat the horse fly when a fly swatter would suffice. If taken too literally the book would be titled YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO HAVE HORSES, DO YOU? and drive everyone except diehard cowboys away from even considering owning horses. Yes, owning horses is a big responsibility but I have only heard of a few extremely rare cases where horses truly suffered as the result of unprepared owners.<br /><br />However, I see this as a minor thing. Read the book for the great information that it imparts and don't let the stump speeches about whether you are ready to own a horse by the authors get in the way.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN	2005-05-28

The shortsighted assumption is, among some, that the popularity of the game began with Tiger Woods or maybe with Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.<br /><br />In THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED we learn the true story. Not only does Mark Frost offer a wonderfully readable account of the beginnings of golf in the United States, he also offers great stories of the lives of other golfers, in the States and in Britain, who were the Founding Fathers of the ancient game in the \\"modern\\" world. Center stage in the story we meet young Francis Ouimet, the George Washington, really, of golf in the United States, an unassuming man without whom there would not have been the popular game that would ultimately give us Jones, Palmer, Nicklaus and Woods.<br /><br />Frost's account of the life of Harry Vardon offers one of the best biographies written of, arguably, the greatest golfer ever.  Not only did Vardon offer many of the mechanics that would revolutionize golf, he also was the standard for etiquette that continues to make the game remarkable and special.<br /><br />Add to all that the detailed, hole-by-hole, day-by-day account of the 1913 US Open at the Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts and the lives of Ted Ray, Jerry Travers, and Wilfred Reid and what you get with THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is an amazing golf history.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN	2005-03-06

Tony Hillerman delivers in COYOTE WAITS, another of his Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee mysteries.  As usual Hillerman masterfully weaves Navajo traditions, culture and references with modern crime in the Southwest.<br /><br />COYOTE WAITS pits the skills of Leaphorn and Chee against a marauding phantom with a paint can who is out defacing the natural formations of the desert. Doesn't sound like much, does it?  Well, it isn't.  When a fellow tribal policeman turns up dead while pursuing the painting vandal the plot inevitably thickens.<br /><br />COYOTE WAITS also makes dynamic statements about some of the terrible problems that continue to face Native Americans in the Four Corners area. Hillerman's genius is obvious here. His narrative employs believable characters that confront real-life problems in ways that invite the reader to stop and consider that very real issues are out there and need to be addressed.<br /><br />A great book.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN	2005-01-26

In the first place this book makes one monumental error in assumption: that material wealth is the end all, beat all of life and that virtually every human being on the earth today can be a millionaire! I suppose that if getting rich is your goal then FIVE LESSONS... is the book for you. Otherwise be careful with this one and be ready to be disappointed.<br /><br />The author goes to great lengths to sound like a down-to-earth guy who followed the rules that he presents and became a millionaire. But then he begins to throw in questionable stuff about hoarding precious metals and getting involved in \\"appropriate\\" schemes like network marketing in order to make it all happen.<br /><br />Please! The advertisements regarding this book, packed nicely in the advertising spaces before and after the LDS General Conference broadcasts, were all too telling. This was to be a book that was different than the usual gospels of proponents of get-rich-quick thinking. What emerged was a monumental bait and switch that made it seem that this book was a modest, clean way to manage life appropriately. Instead the author can't resist vomiting up the usual flotsam and jetsam regarding material wealth as being the \\"normal\\" outcome of a life well lived (and rules well followed).<br /><br />My two stars are for some good advice about avoiding debt and watching where your pennies are going. The other three were as hard to obtain as the material wealth promised by following the tenets propounded in this book!<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN	2004-11-17

While we have photographs of Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, Gall, Rain in the Face, Chief Joseph and Geronimo, no image of Crazy Horse, the legendary field general of the Lakota, exists or has survived.<br /><br />Past efforts at providing a credible literary portrayal of the man have reeked of the mythology that pervaded Western History.  All through those accounts the stereotype of supposed ruthless savagery lingered in the background, like a vile stench.  Even those authors who tried to be fair couldn't, somehow, rise above the temptation to sensationalize Crazy Horse.<br /><br />Why is it that we tolerate such fiction? Why is it that we succumb to the temptation to paint all of our enemies, past and present, as demons and devils without honestly trying to understand where they were coming from?  Sadly, this continues to be the major problem when whites (of whom I am one) contemplate the bloody history of conflicts between their ancestors and Native Americans.  We just can't seem to let go of the prospect that we were the ones that were wrong!<br /><br />Now Lakota author, Joseph Marshall III, provides a sensitive account of the life of Crazy Horse drawn from the rich Native American oral tradition that still exists for all who are open-minded enough to hear it. What better way and who better to tell the story of a hero? THE JOURNEY OF CRAZY HORSE: A LAKOTA HISTORY relates the life of Crazy Horse, as Mr. Marshall promises in his foreword, as a Native American storyteller might.<br /><br />What emerges is the story of a good man, a man who, for his part, fought for what he believed was right.  From his beginnings to his rise as a gifted warrior and leader to his triumph at The Greasy Grass Fight (The Battle of the Little Bighorn) to his death in 1877, Crazy Horse lives for the very first time with an accuracy and tenderness that seem most fitting.<br /><br />Marshall also relates the traditional accounts of the man off the battle field. We discover a caring father, brother, husband and friend.  THE JOURNEY OF CRAZY HORSE: A LAKOTA HISTORY provides, at last, an accurate portrait of one of America's greatest leaders.  Hopefully readers will see this, looking past the stereotypes and prejudices of the past that seem all too alive and well today.<br /><br />THE HORSEMANl accounts of the man off the battle field.

I had no idea about what to expect.  I wasn't even sure what the story of the book was.<br /><br />In reading the book I was not disappointed in the least.  The book turned out to be an absolute page turner.  I found myself comparing the book to the most recent children's book that I had read - THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX by J.K. Rowling.  There was no comparison.  PETER AND THE STAR CATCHERS is destined to be a classic and it has all the stuff necessary to become a classic film, in either live action or animation.<br /><br />A young orphan named Peter is sentenced with his comrades to an island that is ruled by an evil king.  Aboard a ship named Never Land, they set off to seek adventure.  The ship's cargo, a prized trunk, holds the promise of added adventure for Peter and his compadres.<br /><br />The story has everything that one might expect from a boy named Peter on a ship named Never Land.  Despite the fact that the reader guesses quickly the tale's relationship to the classic tales of Peter Pan, PETER AND THE STAR CATCHERS offers a natural addition to the stories that totally makes sense.  You'll never consider Peter Pan again without thinking of this book as part of the \\"history.\\"<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN	2004-09-17

All have seen a multiplicity of images, the stereotypic Pony Express horse and rider, that grace a variety of corporate stationery, restaurant menus and billboards. But who really knows the truth of the history of this singularly American venture?<br /><br /> Living in Pony Express country and having done my share of reading and having visited various Express-related sites I thought I was fairly well versed. But after reading ORPHANS PREFERRED: THE TWISTED TRUTH AND LASTING LEGEND OF THE PONY EXPRESS by Christopher Corbett I have to admit that my supposed knowledge was more a collection of the myth surrounding this short-lived, though spectacular, chapter in history.<br /><br /> ORPHANS PREFERRED... was thoroughly enjoyable read. Corbett does what all responsible authors tackling a dubious subject should do: he collects all of the information, both factual and fabricated, puts it in the hopper and does his best to sort things through. Then he leaves it to us, his readers, to maker our own conclusions. Not once in the book does Mr. Corbett claim to be totally convinced that this or that piece of information is undeniably true or undeniably false. He correctly leaves it to various quoted sources to do that.<br /><br /> But what else could he do? The information available about the Pony Express is at best a jumbled mess. Such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody and James Butler \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok muddied the waters with their efforts to link themselves to and take credit for various aspects of the Express. Hollywood, playing on this hearsay and extensive legend, did its best as well to further mess things up. The result: not one of us, including Author Corbett (and that made very clear by his own admission in the book), has a clear picture of what really went on.<br /><br /> But who's really counting? Corbett does a masterful job of setting straight, at least in my mind, what is absolute fact and what is absolute fiction, leaving a considerable amount of gray area in between.<br /><br /> Corbett eloquently points out in ORPHANS PREFERRED... that the legend will ride on regardless. Thank goodness it does. Legends are great so long as we know they are legends. But as Americans would we really let any of our favorite legends go, among which the Pony Express holds an honored place, without a considerable fight?<br /><br /> John Ford's movie, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE perhaps says it best: This is the west, sir.

LONESOME DOVE, Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning western novel may be one of the most neglected books ever written.  That is, when compared to the success of the video that was based on the book.  Of late, in discussions with fellow western lovers I have been amazed at the number of Lonesome Dove (the video) fans who have never read the book.<br /><br />I explain that there's so much more to the book. Granted, performances like those rendered by Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall in bringing to life McMurtry's characters, Woodrow F. Call and Augustus McCrae don't come along every day but then neither do characters like these.<br /><br />In LONESOME DOVE McMurtry creates the definitive story of the west.  This will be the one against which all others in the future (and many in the past) will be measured. While other western authors seek the stereotypes of the west, McMurtry fearlessly portrays the west in all of its gritty, grimey grandeur.

The book covers Cook's humble beginnings as an ordinary seaman, his progress up the ranks of the merchant marine and his unlikely ascension to the rank of captain in the Royal Navy. The account of his major voyages is a spellbinding narrative that explains clearly that Cook's contribution to world discovery remains unparalleled.<br />An excellent history, FARTHER THAN ANY MAN tells both sides of the Cook story; his cartographic genius--creating maps and charts that remained the standard well in the twentieth century, his unflinching courage and determination, his boundless vision, and his dominating ego that ultimately led to his untimely death in Hawaii.<br />FARTHER THAN ANY MAN is a page-turner that you won't be able to put down.

I wanted to read the interviews that Krakauer had had with Lafferty and to get a better understanding as to how such heinous crimes could be perpetrated against members of the Lafferty family--Dan's own extended family-- in the name of religion. The book was informative from that standpoint.<br />But if you think that this book will give you the supposed inside story of a possible dark side of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) you are sadly mistaken and, if you are honest, sadly disappointed.<br />Krakauer's approach to this book goes markedly against the grain of responsible journalism. Are their two sides to this story? Absolutely! But Krakauer is careful to tell only a limited, sensationalized, one-sided version that is totally misleading. Had Krakauer been fair enough to give both sides of the account I would be writing a very different review. Instead what you have is a hard cover tabloid.<br />In the first place, none of the fundamentalists interviewed by Krakauer are members of the LDS Church. Since the late 1800's all individuals practicing polygamy and, more importantly, given to views and teachings that are inflammatory and contrary to those accepted by the LDS Church are summarily excommunicated. Moreover, Dan Lafferty--even in the Krakauer interviews--admits that he is not a member of the LDS Church and that his beliefs depart dramatically from anything the LDS Church teaches.<br />In the second place, Krakauer's supposed research is extremely limited and riddled with references to the works of individuals like Fawn Brodie--a self-avowed nonobjective enemy of the LDS faith who wasted her life away writing unbelievable drivel about the LDS Church's origins. Mind you, she didn't stop with unsupportable rubbish about Mormonism. She also wrote a &quot;landmark&quot; series of books about America's Founding Fathers that painted them as nothing more than a lecherous bunch of womanizers who just got lucky when it came to democracy. Those familiar with Brodie's writings recognize that her hostile feminism is as transparent as water and the chip on her shoulder all too evident.<br />If you are sincerely and fairly interested in historic facts regarding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints read Leonard Arrington's excellent biography of Brigham Young, American Moses. It provides a fair narrative of many of the events about the Church's history included in Krakauer's book--information terribly twisted and misrepresented, I might add.<br />If you want to read this book in order to look at radical religious fundamentalism, especially the tragic events centering on Dan Lafferty and his brother, Ron, then do so. But take Krakauer's supposed &quot;facts&quot; about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-days Saints as what they are--nothing more than mean-spirited, small-minded hearsay.faith who wasted her life away writing unbelievable drivel about the LDS Church's origins.

But why is that the case?  Why is it that we don't want an objective view of someone like Reagan or Lincoln or Washington?  Does it diminish the subject?  Is it somehow a form of heresy? Not in the least! In fact in my opinion it is through biographies like DUTCH: A MEMOIR OF RONALD REAGAN by Pulitzer Prize winner Edmund Morris that we really get close to the human side of great people like Ronald Reagan.<br />DUTCH provides a creative, close-up look at Reagan, a brilliant man but a flawed man as virtually all of us--even those that we choose to deify--are.<br />Who better than Morris to provide us this look.  Morris spent numerous hours with Reagan, seeing him in all lights and in all situations.  A case in point seems to make the case: Reagan's first fianc&eacute;e, Margaret Cleaver.  Through his research Morris was able to &quot;dig up the dirt&quot; about Reagan and Cleaver.  Reagan, upon discovering that Morris had made such a discovery was apparently coldly indignant that the discovery had been made and would be included in Morris' biography.<br />And why would Reagan be angry that a supposedly complete biography would include this fact?  Perhaps he was beginning to believe the myths that were, at that time, already surfacing about him.<br />All of us have our regrets, our secrets and chapters of our history that we would rather not remember.<br />Morris provides the good and the bad, the brilliant and the bawdy, the immortal and the earthbound about arguably one of America's greatest individuals--let alone one of her greatest presidents. Don't miss out simply because you want to worship at the altar of Ronald Reagan rather than taking the chance, through Morris' marvelous biography, to chat, as it were, with Reagan in person.	2004-06-07

I suspect that most of the negative responses to this book have come from readers who made this unfortunate, though understandable, error.<br />Nonetheless, SACAGAWEA'S NICKNAME, a collection of essays by McMurtry, is an essential read for any true McMurtry fan, providing an in-depth look into the mind of arguably the preeminent author of the West. After reading this book you will definitely have a better and clearer handle on where McMurtry is coming from when he applies his encyclopedic abilities to writing the next great western novel.<br />Essays include evaluations and critiques of western authors and introductions to some that need to be rediscovered, including Angie Debo and, as indicated by the title, stimulating overviews of Lewis and Clark's expedition west and their affinity for and appreciation of Sacagawea.<br />McMurtry also tackles subjects that mainstream western literature readers may find difficult.  Despite the years that have past McMurtry eloquently handles the question of our treatment of Native Americans and asks the continuing and unanswered questions regarding what needs to be done if we are to do the right thing after all.	2004-05-13

Despite reviews that paint this book as being about as violent as anything that McMurtry has written, I determined to complete the tale of a family of dysfunctional British gentry who come to America in the early Nineteenth Century to \\"see the sights\\" as it were.<br /><br />What I discovered was yet another fine work by McMurtry that was a joy to read. Regarding McMurtry's treatment of violence, I suspect his statement to the modern reader is that violence in the past was as everyday as eating, sleeping or breathing. To our mollycoddled world, where tragedy manifests itself most acutely in the outcome of the latest reality TV program or contest, McMurtry's nonchalant depictions of frontier violence may seem insensitive. But in a world where one could be moving along the trail swimmingly one minute and gasping for life the next with an Apache arrow in his [...] it was likely very common to develop a rather McMurtryan viewpoint of life, of death and of the violence inherent to both.<br /><br />As with the other three volumes of this series, FOLLY AND GLORY delivers a very engrossing tale with the usual cameo appearances of some of the geographical area's and period's most notable figures. From Old Santa Fe to the Alamo, FOLLY AND GLORY is another McMurtry triumph.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN	2004-05-13

We attempt to disconnect them and say that one has to be better than others in the series while seemingly forgetting that a story begins, it flows and it ends.<br /><br />Such is the case with Larry McMurtry's landmark LONESOME DOVE collection. While it's easy to take LONESOME DOVE, the original book offered here, and single it out as noteworthy and award-winning (winner of the Pulitzer Prize, in fact), it seems foolish to compare it to the other three books in the series and conclude that they fall short while LONESOME DOVE stands alone. Such is certainly the temptation when considering COMANCHE MOON, the final book written but second in the chronological saga.<br /><br />Here McMurtry fills in many of the gaps that existed between the end of DEAD MAN'S WALK and LONESOME DOVE. We learn much more about Gus and Clara and their failed relationship. We learn about Maggie Tilton, the whore that Call truly loved but couldn't accept, even when she mothers Call's son, Newt. We are introduced to two young rangers, Pea Eye Parker and Jake Spoon, characters so essential to LONESOME DOVE'S sweeping epic. Famous shoes also makes an appearance and, importantly, we learn of Blue Duck's background and just how he fits into the grand story that McMurtry composes.<br /><br />COMANCHE MOON also provides an account of the stepping stones taken by our heroes and their enemies as they move southward, landing them in \\"a little fart of a town called Lonesome Dove.\\" Yes, we can begin a story somewhere -- anywhere -- but, in my thinking, it never hurts when an author, whether in the original book or in an accompanying volume, takes the time to tell how we got there in the first place.<br /><br />As with all McMurtry works, COMANCHE MOON is replete with some of the best and complete characters to grace the pages of the Western genre. Who can resist the impetuous Inez Scull, the wife of Ranger Commander Inish Scull? She approaches life, especially the men in it, as if it were nothing more than her personal smorgasbord to be indulged, consumed and, ultimately, eliminated with no more than a fleeting thought. Inish, for his part, isn't much different. McMurty's supporting cast here of rangers, townspeople, hermits and whores adds to overall complexion that makes his work truly enchanting.<br /><br />And true to McMurtry form, the book is populated by a variety of villains and scoundrels, as evil as any to be found on the McMurtry landscape. Chief among these is Ahumado, the Black Vaquero, a man so casual about death and torture that he approaches his \\"work\\" as mildly as any accountant might view his ledgers. After all, Ahumado's casual though chilling villainy and violence are what McMurtry's masterful wordsmithing is all about!<br /><br />In short, LONESOME DOVE is the collective story found in four volumes, including COMANCHE MOON. To try to compare the parts, one against another, is like trying to decide which bite of a perfect filet mignon was best. You can't help but lose some of the overall flavor in the process. My advice is to enjoy them all.<br /><br />So read and enjoy COMANCHE MOON for the richness it adds to LONESOME DOVE and to the other two books in the story. And now, with a major miniseries based on the book in filming for network television release in the near future, you'll want to read the book for the first time or again in order to have the story fresh in your mind!<br /><br />THE HORSEMANScull?

The title, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE, is a very loose tie between the movie and this book.  Beyond that, things get a little dicey and I am not sure that I can give the book the same rave reviews that I gave the movie.<br /><br />Well, actually, it's a lot easier than that.  The book falls considerably short of what the movie became under the masterful touch of Robert Redford.  Like his work on THE HORSE WHISPERER, Redford was able to make a movie that improves upon a book and get to the nugget of a great story, leaving out stuff that seems sometimes to ooze from the imagination of an author who gets too caught up in and excited about the supposed profoundness of his own story.<br /><br />In the end that's the real problem with THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE (the book).  Pressfield, obviously an individual who feels much for the game of golf and its parallels with life, gets sucked into the out-of-control upward spiral of his awe for the game. He likely collapsed after writing several of the more revved up passages. It wasn't enough to call golf a game, Pressfield had to take the next step and try to build a case for golf as the basis for a lost and resurgent religion. Bagger Vance as a wild pagan god of war? Junah as a bizarre victim of what can best be described as Jack Nicklaus on a bummer trip?  The golf swing--the Authentic Swing--as an essential component of and precursor to achieving a peaceful and happy existence? All way too weird and ethereal for me!<br /><br />But there are many redeeming factors to this book.  Read chapter 11 with its descriptions of the golf swing as a metaphor. Read chapter 12 with its descriptions of the game in comparison to other sports and the sheer difficulty of the game.  Read chapter 16 with its wonderful wordsmithing about the importance of a good grip, more on the game's difficulty and the individual nature of golf competition. Finally, the beginning paragraphs of chapter 20 speak briefly, but eloquently, about the need for a golfer to be keenly aware of the clubhead and the power that comes in the golf swing from a deliberately wide swing arc.  Other than these references you are on your own.<br /><br />Rent or buy the movie and enjoy its simple but profound appreciation for golf as probably the greatest game ever devised by man and leave most of the book to the arena of too much information or, perhaps, to too much imagination.clubhead and the power that comes in the golf swing from a deliberately wide swing arc.

For many years the professional golfer was the guy in the limelight on golf's center stage.  That was it.  Think about it.  Can anyone name those who carried the bag for Jones, Hagen, Sarazen, Snead, Nicklaus, Player or Palmer?  Unless you are a bookish expert on the undercover aspects of golf it is likely that you can't.<br />And then things changed.  And who changed them?  Almost magically we all became acquainted with Tom Watson's caddy, Bruce Edwards.  He was always there and he brought an appropriate respect to those who, day in and day out, walked the courses with the golfers we admired.<br />It was Edwards' focus on being a caddy--a professional part of the game--that changed things.  No longer just some person brought along to tote the bag, the caddie emerged as an essential partner in the process.<br />Today it is not uncommon for us to know the names of the caddies of many of the top pros on tour or to keep track of their activities.  For example, wasn't it interesting that, just a few years ago, Tiger Woods' decision to replace Mike &quot;Fluff' Cowan with Steve Williams as his caddy made almost headline news in the world of golf? It was equally interesting that we all cheered when Fluff resurfaced on Jim Furyk's bag and was there when Furyk seized his first major at the 2003 US Open. I think I correctly surmise that none of this would have  ever made a paragraph in the news without the pioneering influence of Bruce Edwards.<br />It's important to remember, as well, that Edwards gained his notoriety BEFORE his being tragically stricken with ALS.  This book is not the result of someone playing solely on the tragedy but an &quot;it's about time&quot; story of one of the great personalities of the game of golf.<br />CADDY FOR LIFE: THE BRUCE EDWARDS STORY is a must read for anyone who loves the game.  Filled with anecdotes, perspectives and the story of arguably golf's first recognized caddy, the book is an essential addition to the library of any serious student of the game.student of the game.	2004-04-05

This book, a bawdy, bragging, vulgar look at an insignificant golf career, is, in the end, essentially avoidable.  Avoid it because it really does nothing for the game and, surprisingly and ultimately does nothing for its author.<br />But in the end Ken Venturi's new book, GETTING UP & DOWN: MY SIXTY YEARS IN GOLF, should be avoided like the Road Hole Bunker at St. Andrews for one major reason: Venturi's cowardly and inappropriate lashing out in the book against Arnold Palmer, claiming that Palmer cheated to win the 1958 Masters.  Isn't it interesting that this is surfacing now, thirty-six years after the fact?  Wouldn't an \\"honorable\\" golfer have registered his concerns immediately, regardless of consequences?  Certainly!  Makes you wonder just how honorable Venturi was and is, doesn't it?  Well let's look at some of Venturi's own words.  He claims that he decided not to go public earlier with his allegations because \\"if anything, going public would damage my fragile image even further.\\"  Interesting!  Damage a fragile image even further?  Mysterious!  Not worried about damaging Palmer's public image.  Worried about damaging his own \\"fragile\\" image.<br />Venturi also says that he waited to register his complaints because of his \\"responsibilities and loyalties to CBS. The network needed to maintain a good relationship with Augusta National.\\" Fascinating!  Wouldn't it be a little clearer to say that, given his lackluster professional career, managing only one major--the 1964 US Open--Venturi crawled into a hole of silence so as not to risk losing the only job he had?<br />Venturi claims further that Augusta National co-founders Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts told him years later that Palmer should not have received the favorable ruling.  What? The perfect time to go public and to come clean and all with the sanction and backing of the patron saint of American golf, the great Bobby Jones.  But no!  Besides no one has been able to confirm Venturi's claims here because both Jones and Roberts have been dead now for more than 25 years. How convenient.<br />Now, if Arnold Palmer were truly guilty of an infraction that should have cost him his first major, wouldn't he try to suppress the story at every turn?  Quite certainly!  Instead Palmer has mentioned the ruling in two of his books, A GOLFERS LIFE and PLAYING BY THE RULES: ALL THE RULES OF THE GAME, COMPLETE WITH MEMORABLE RULINGS FROM GOLF'S RICH HISTORY (2002). In the latter, he forthrightly discusses his dispute with the on-course officials on hand at Augusta and the fact that he declared he would play two balls and appeal to the tournament committee. Perfectly appropriate under the rules of golf.  In his book Palmer states, \\"I later heard that Ken Venturi was particularly upset, feeling like he had been cheated by my second-ball situation at the 12th.

Quite interesting, isn't it, that Venturi, who, playing with Palmer, surely saw Palmer's fairway meeting with Jones, fails to mention this in his book.<br />Finally, Venturi claims that his timing for his book release is to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of his 1964 US Open Championship.  Rubbish!  Venturi still apparently has problems with the truth. Everyone knows that the Open is an annual Father's Day event.  Why not wait until June and a fitting anniversary for his one major?  Because it is more than likely that Venturi wants to attempt to blemish what is likely Arnold Palmer's final Masters.

Filled with anecdotes, stories and practical golf advice, Penick's book is a forthright, enjoyable read.  No wonder these lessons had such an impact on the likes of golf greats Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite, both of whom were Penick proteges.<br />Penick's book also lends a classical look at a classical game.  With all that's going on in the world of golf today: the exorbitant salaries, conflicts about equipment and vintage courses becoming too short, Penick's book reminds us that once upon a time golf was a genial game instead of a rabid business.  Read it and gain some needed perspective on the greatest game in the world.<br />THE HORSEMAN	2004-03-19

Like LITTLE RED it brings with it a distinctive flavor for the game that is lacking in a sport that has been blown out of proportion by golfing superstars and their embarrassingly large salaries.  Penick's words remind golfers everywhere that, in the end, golf is less about celebrity and endorsements and stuffy business sponsors and all about each individual golfer as he or she battles it out on the home course.<br />THE HORSEMAN	2004-03-19

While the ability of a golfer to win not one but two US Opens is remarkable it doesn't necessarily translate into the ability to put down on paper an interesting book on golf.  That seems to be what we have here.<br />During his career on the PGA Tour Andy North was not known for his on-course flash and pizzazz. At his best he was a steady albeit ho-hum golfer.  Still he had the right game at the right time to win US Open Championships in 1978 and 1985.<br />But that's really where the interest ends in THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT.  The chapters in this book about North's being introduced to golf, his learning the game, his college golf and his days on tour are, to borrow an appropriate clich&eacute;, &quot;as dull as ditch water.&quot;  No fireworks.  No destiny! No come-from-behind drama.  Nothing.<br />With all due respect, North is necessarily relegated to that long list of golfers about whom we are left to scratch our heads.  How did they pull it off?  But, hey, such head scratching is one of the great things about golf.  On any given Sunday the generic golfer might emerge, garner his fifteen minutes of Warholic fame as a major championship winner--even a double winner--and appropriately fade away.  Sadly there will inevitably be those like North who, apparently unable to accept their unadulterated luck, write books and drag all of us through the abject lackluster of their mediocre careers.<br />Regarding this one, it's time to pick up your ball and move on to the next hole.<br />THE HORSEMAN	2004-03-09

The swing that was so easy was always hard enough to fill the bill.  And Boros' accuracy was uncanny.<br />What could be more applicable in today's approach to golf.  We see professionals swinging savagely at the ball with a variety of resulting shots.  It's easy to believe that you need the same sort of swing for your game.  Take another look.<br />In SWING EASY, HIT HARD Boros offers a simple, applicable, unpretentious look at the essentials of the easy, hard-hitting swing.  This is a very short read with but everything that you will need.  The grip, the takeaway, various stances for various clubs.

The sad fact remains that what works for Tiger might not work for you (even with equal ability).<br />But Tiger's book is about as good as it gets.  The fundamentals are all there and if you're going to get a golf instruction this would be the one to buy.  Just remember that once you've got the fundamentals down it's time to go to your local course and spend some time with a PGA pro finding and refining your own swing.<br />THE HORSEMAN	2004-02-29

Well I think I have finally pegged Mr. Andrisani: He's the unofficial president of the Tiger Woods fan club.  Like THINK LIKE TIGER, SHORT GAME MAGIC is far too much about Andrisani's regard for his hero and nothing special when it comes to the subject: improving your short game.<br />Sure, the fundamentals are there but presented in the same way as of a variety of similar books by other golfers.  The thing that you have to remember about Tiger is that his short game becomes moot because his long game makes it all possible.

Nicklaus, Watson, Palmer--even Tiger--have all spoken of the intuitive aspects of the game and how too much thinking can be the death of your next round.<br />John Andrisani, in his book THINK LIKE TIGER: AN ANALYSIS OF TIGER'S MENTAL GAME, wants us to believe that Tiger is a golf-a-matic, an android that has been programmed by thought and is constantly on autopilot.  Yes, Tiger is one of the greatest thinkers in the game but he is still human as evidenced by his mediocre 2003 season.  His strategies during that season were no different than in previous seasons but the results were.<br />So what happened?  Golf, that's what happened. Golf is a streaky game. Think about David Duvall. He finally won a major and everyone said he was back. Then all of a sudden it was over.  For now.  That's golf and no one, not even Tiger, is above it.<br />Andrisani in THINK LIKE TIGER... seems to preach that somehow Tiger is above the game.  Reading the book one would think that Andrisani is telling all the competition that they might as well accept second place because there is no way, really, to think like Tiger.  So what does that say for the rest of us and why should we buy and read this book?<br />All is not lost with THINK LIKE TIGER... but you must be careful to see past Andrisani's all too apparent and excessive hero worship.<br />The book delineates some very good things about the mind game of golf.
