On this Field Edition, each of the 26 charts measures 13.5&quot; by 18.25&quot;.  Star viewable area of each chart is 11.25 by 16.25&quot;.  Large enough to see down to the 8th magnitude star.<BR>With it's Main Index Sheet and another sheet with a rough diagram of what is on each chart, it is easy to quickly find the Constellation you seek.<BR>The Introduction explains the symbols and lines used on the charts.  With ~43,000 stars, ~2500 deep-sky objects and various points of interest, the charts are well drawn.<BR>With known position of moving objects (like planets, comets, or asteroids) found in a magazine, the clear plastic overlay helps find where it should be positioned, down to &lt;1 minute Right Ascension and/or &lt;10 degrees Declination, almost assuring that you should be able to find where to look in the sky.	2003-05-30

He didn't need anything higher than high school geometry math to explain most of his subjects.  About the same math that was around back in Newton's time.<br />A lot of the diagrams in the book jump from one section of the subject to another, but they are brought back together eventually.  If you get lost in 1 of the 20 (or more) diagrams within one section of the whole lecture you may not totaly understand when the conclusion is reached.  It helped to have the book in front of me - where I could go back and re-read from the part that I figure I got lost.<br />Listening to the CD and reading along (in Chapter 4) was a bit tricky.  After a few pauses/rewind/replay I caught on and can say I understand planet orbits.<br />A good book to have if you are a fan of R. Feynman.	2002-02-17
