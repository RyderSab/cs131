US	50951948	R3NSX4QQZC8KV4	1564783723	612491018	Television	Books	5	10	10	N	N	hardly working	Imagine:  you are on sabbatical in Berlin, expecting to begin work on a monograph about the painter Titian.  Your family is away on holiday.  You've had it with television, and you've decided to give it up.  But television is everywhere, as are its cousins:  video monitors, surveillance cameras, etc.  Such is the premise of this novel, Television, by Jean-Philippe Toussaint.   <br /> <br />Like Toussaint's novels _Monsieur_ and _The Bathroom_, Television is about a rather pathetic everyman-sort of protagonist.  He gives up television (or so we think?).  He can't begin to get past the first two words of his Titian monograph.  He hangs out with his friend John Dory.  He visits an art museum.  He swims at a nude beach.  John Dory and the protagonist take an airplane ride over the city.  His neighbors are away on holiday, and they would like him to water their houseplants.  He can't quite remember to do that.  Ostensibly on a plant-watering trip, he watches television in their home, and rationalizes that he never meant to give it up completely (what if the Olympic 100M dash were televised, and he wished to watch that 10 seconds of broadcast?  should he deny himself that?  a measly 10 seconds?). <br /> <br />Toussaint's protagonist seems very likeable, very anti-heroic, and very human: warts, foibles, and all.  The musings on television (as passive entertainment, as constant companion, as whatever) are not tiresome at all.  They are a welcome complement to the plot, such as it is.  Among Toussaint's special gifts is a reserve, a distance that he places between himself and the actions of his characters and scenes.  At the same time, the minutiae of those scenes are vividly realized.   <br /> <br />_Television_ is very funny, and it is quite well written. <br /> <br />Toussaint has become one of my favorite novelists.  Highly recommended.	2005-07-21

The author of _Monsieur_ as well as _The Bathroom_, Toussaint excels when cleverly describing situations in agonizing detail, with all the skill of an artful rendering or a classic oil painting.  There are no whirlwhinds of action, barroom brawls or car chases.  The action in _Making Love_ occurs in scenes involving dropped umbrellas, inconvenient faxes, and missed taxis.  A couple has drifted apart, and their relationship will apparently end in Japan.  An ultramodern Tokyo provides the sterile spaces against which the drama is played out.  The narrator carries a bottle of hydrochloric acid with him at all times.  What will he do?  Will he toss it in the face of a stranger?  His girlfriend?  The female protagonist, a prickly conundrum, cries and sulks.  As their worlds seem to crumble around them, the couple tumbles through a landscape of outer calm and inner turmoil. As the reader comes to finish the novel, he realizes that Toussaint has made himself a hero of sorts, simply through the molding of his bleakly wonderful creation.    What a marvelous novel.  While _Making Love_ has none of the humor of _The Bathroom_ or _Monsieur_ (both are recommended), it remains a worthwhile read for Toussaint's gifted description of lives coming apart.	2004-10-18

The author discusses the roles objects play in our lives, from mirrors to automobiles to furniture.  He dissects the role and purpose of credit (in the late 1960's; his ideas about the expansion of credit purchasing are humorous in hindsight). Author devotes sections to gadgets, gizmos, and robots.      Some of OBJECTS' highlights:  a discussion of why the rich and other status seekers acquire old things, a critique of collectors and their motivations (\\"everything that cannot be invested in human relationships is invested in objects.\\"), and a commendable exegesis of the personalization of cars (since the 1970s this critique could be expanded to houses).  In addition the section on credit is juicy:  \\"the credit system is the acme of man's irresponsibility to himself.\\"      Should I credit the translator with handling a difficult text well?  I can't say.  I don't read French (at least not on Baudrillard's level).  However, the reader is left with some of the most pompous and opaque prose.  Nothing is stated simply.  Example:  \\"In the love relationship the tendency to break the object down into discrete details in accordance with a perverse autoerotic system is slowed by the living unity of the other person.\\"  Another:  \\"We may thus trace functional mythologies, born of technics itself, all the way to a sort of fatality in which the world-mastering technology seems to crystallize in the form of an inverse and threatening purpose.\\"    Here's a favorite:  \\"Thus freed from practical functions and from the human gestural system, forms become purely relative with respect both to one another and to the space to which they lend 'rhythm.' \\"    These overwrought and ridiculous passages would be humorous, but they impede the reader's understanding of the text.   Various worthwhile statements pepper the book throughout, which could be condensed into a sort of \\"famous quotes by Baudrillard,\\" perhaps as captions in a book of photographs, a coffee-table book.  I recommend this currently  nonexistent product.  Until its creation, we must be partially satisfied by SYSTEM OF OBJECTS.       Ken Miller	2004-09-22

Jean lives with his lovely wife, a quiet life of boredom and resignation, in a miserably drearly home.  Jean's wife is a study in satisfaction.  The home is crumbling around them, yet she is not motivated to seek change.  Jean wants more.  He is continuously unsatisfied; he longs for a more exciting and fulfilling life.  After enduring a visit from a ghost aunt, Jean disappears.  Literally vanishing into thin air, Jean moves into another plane of existence.  <br />In scene two, Jean appears on a platform suspended in air.  He is trying to find his wife.  Two employees guarding the entrance of a museum (?!) talk with him.  It seems Jean has already seen beautiful views and breathtaking vistas on his journey-- images much cheerier than the walls of his dingy and sinking home.  <br />In scene three, Jean arrives at an inn run by fake monks.  He is fed.  He imbibes, but he is never satisfied.  Always hungry and thirsty, Jean sits while the monks pump him for information.  What has he seen?  Where has he been?  It seems these monks are too eager for news of the outside world.  They prepare and stage a grotesque play for Jean's benefit.  During the play, one of the monks insists that Jean answer the question &quot;what do you believe in?&quot;  Tiring of the performance and famished, Jean answers &quot;I believe in my soup!&quot;   After witnessing this crass farce, Jean begins his monastic duty:  serving food.  As the scene winds down, it is apparent (to the reader, but not to the protagonist) that Jean will never leave.  Through insinuations and inferences, the reader comes to realize that the inn is, in fact, hell.  <br />In Hunger and Thirst, Ionesco has succeeded in showing desperation and the impossibility of satisfaction.  Jean, a romantic seeker, is left in the end wondering why he ever wished for more than his modest home and wife.  Throughout, the play is funny.  As valuable as the author's best known work (Rhinoceros, or perhaps The Bald Soprano), Hunger and Thirst is rarely mentioned in a list of Ionesco's best drama.  I take exception to such an ignorant omission.  Hunger and Thirst measures up to any of Ionesco's plays.	2004-07-07

Then, he makes pancakes while the cook is away.  He makes them quicker and better than the cook.  Then the cook chases him away.  As usual, George gets in a little bit of trouble.  Then all is well, and everyone praises George.<br />This book has part of the charm of CURIOUS GEORGE GOES TO AN ICE CREAM SHOP, with almost exactly the same plot.  There's nothing surprising here-- kids and adults will see Curious George in another formulaic plot.  This book was adapted from the Curious George film series, and it is based on characters created by H.A. Rey.  It is NOT one of the George books written by H.A. Rey.<br />Some readers are delighted by Curious George, and the plot doesn't matter.  In that case, choose CURIOUS GEORGE MAKES PANCAKES.<br />If you want a better story, try CURIOUS GEORGE GOES TO AN ICE CREAM SHOP, or, better still, one of the H.A. Rey-authored original Curious George stories, such as CURIOUS GEORGE GOES TO THE HOSPITAL or CURIOUS GEORGE GETS A MEDAL.	2004-06-30

It's got polar bears posing as girl scouts.  The primary law enforcement officer is a bunny.   The setting is a town called Yellowtooth.<br />Welcome to the twisted and hilarious world of Daniel Pinkwater.  Irving and Muktuk are polar bears who want to steal muffins.  In jerky and often funny prose, Pinkwater describes their repeated near-exploits.  Always foiled by the bunny (who even utilizes a helicopter and a net to capture the villains), Irving and Muktuk never flag in their optimism or their enthusiasm for thievery.  In the end, the ursine ladrónes are shipped off to Bayonne, New Jersey (The Muffin Capitol of the World, in case you failed to notice).<br />This is Pinkwater at his near-best (I still prefer the novel LIZARD MUSIC), so put your hands on a copy of IRVING AND MUKTUK today.

Citizens fall one after another, and the town is transformed from a gossipy, boring burg (where the townspeople all speak in cliches) into a maelstrom of paranoia and horror, as hundreds of citizens literally drop dead.<br />Meanwhile, a dark, hooded and cloaked figure walks amongst the townspeople.  He's like the angel of death, or the grim reaper, or something of that fashion.  <br />THE KILLING GAME is one of Ionesco's last plays.  Much like the plots of his other plays, like THE CHAIRS, or RHINOCEROS, or AMEDEE, the central plot device is one of proliferation and acceleration.  Something is accruing.  The dead bodies are piling up.  (As in Rhinoceros, where the citizens are all being turned into rhinoceri, or Amedee, where the dead body is growing and growing, and the mushrooms are multiplying in the apartment)  As the townspeople are confronted by this crisis, their hypocrisy, crass opportunism, and arrant selfishness is on display.<br />Does this sound depressing?  It's not.  Ionesco is funny.  During one short scene, two people puzzle over the accumulation of bodies.  Moments ago, there were but 2 in a certain spot.  Now there are eleven.  One wonders if the proliferation happened before or after they died.  His companion wonders if it was done &quot;by computer.&quot;  Through scenes such as this, Ionesco lightens the mood.  <br />THE KILLING GAME is a witty and scathing look at the folly of man.  Overall, I don't believe it is one of Ionesco's best plays.  Still, it's the work of a modern master.  For a reader fond of RHINOCEROS, THE BALD SOPRANO, THE CHAIRS, or any of Ionesco's better known plays, THE KILLING GAME will be a satisfying read.	2004-06-09

Kluback and Finkenthal wrote alternating chapters, primarily discussing the philosophy of Ionesco.  Conversations they are not, but the authors alternate chapters partly in descriptions of various facets of Ionesco's philosophy, or differing takes on a certain view of Ionesco, i.e. chapters entitled \\"The Black Sun of Melancholy\\" and \\"Counternotes to the Black Sun of Melancholy.\\"  <br />To a lesser extent this book would serve as a good companion to Ionesco's _Notes and Counter-Notes_ or _Fragments of a Journal_.  The authors only briefly touch on the plays which made Ionesco famous.  Ionesco is limned as an iconoclast who rejected all -isms.  His life is only fleetingly described; _The Clown in the Agora_ is not a biography, nor is it a critical exegesis of his plays.  In fact, this book is perhaps best described as essays by two Ionesco enthusiast/scholars, exploring the philosophy of the late French/Rumanian writer.<br />This volume is a modest contribution to literature.  Still, it is a worthwhile read for a person involved in Ionesco study.  In Finkenthal and Kluback's labor of love the reader can come to better understand Ionesco, one of the 20th century's most important playwrights and writers.  The reader may find it worthwhile to keep _Clown in the Agora_ alongside books of Ionesco's plays and writings for the purpose of cross-reference.  <br />_The Two Faces of Ionesco_ is another helpful volume.  Both this and _Clown in the Agora_ are easily obtained via Interlibrary Loan from your public or university library.   <br />Ken Miller	2004-06-04

He sees Venice as a Disneyland of high culture for tourists.  Fewer and fewer people live in Venice (who could?), yet the city sees an infinite stream of cathedral-gazers and museum-goers.  Debray mocks the stranger \\"mad about Venice\\" (is that so bad?) as the \\"idiot of Venice.\\"  This Debray-- what a sweetie.  Venice compares unfavorably, writes Debray, to Naples.  You read that right.  Naples.  What is left to write?  Islands are suitable for autists, he writes, and feature \\"cheap treats.\\"  Come again?  Debray seemingly swings like a blind drunken boxer, but much of his invective actually hits the intended mark.  (A boxer fighting a mannequin, no less, because Venice of course mutely absorbs the blows...)<br />Lashing out at Venice, Debray writes, \\"We, ourselves, float on a platform of references...\\"  This could describe \\"Anti-Venice\\" as well.  Word for word, Debray drops references like Hansel and Gretel drop bread crumbs.  Proust.  Malraux.  Piazza San Marco.  San Gennaro.  Boucourechliev.  Carpaccio.  St. Jerome.  San Giorgio deli Schiavoni.  These are but some of the names gleaned from a pair of facing pages.  In other words, the casual reader should keep reference materials handy.  <br />Wohlstetter's essay puts Debray's life and work in a historical context, and surpasses \\"Against Venice\\" in clarity and worth, at least for one reader.  Debray was an associate of Mitterand, Castro, and Allende.  Wohlstetter wrote an essay to introduce Debray to the non-specialist, and to pique interest in Debray's other works.  The passages about Debray's political philosophy are fascinating, and I shall seek out more books on Debray's philosophy, or by Debray on this subject.  What an incredible life Debray must have led, as advisor to these leaders.  Let \\"Cicero in Venice\\" serve as our introduction to Debray's other works, both his non-fiction and his novels.	2004-05-10

Among the standouts are a chapter on the &quot;N&quot; word, a chapter on African-Americans in television, and a chapter on African-American leadership. <br />Like McWhorter's LOSING THE RACE (also a good read), this book addresses a number of problems in Black America.  One is the self-defeating attitudes of young African-Americans.  Many see learning is &quot;a white thing.&quot; Of course this contributes to poor academic performance.  Another:  Black politicians are mostly preaching to the choir as they bloviate about the necessity for more government programs and investment in Black communities.  Democrats pushed to expand welfare in the 1960's, primarily to give benefits to poor Black mothers.  Too many people are trapped in lives of poverty, accepting welfare, when instead they should be learning skills and doing their best to get off the dole.  <br />When Booker T. Washington is mentioned lately, the context usually indicates that the speaker or writer basically means &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot;  Thankfully, the author shows the value of Washington's writings to today's America.  McWhorter also demonstrates a solid knowledge of the work of W.E.B. DuBois, an intellectual whose attitudes toward learning would be completely alien to nearly all of Black America today.  <br />McWhorter's opinions ruffle feathers among many Americans of all ethnicities.  His opinions are carefully considered and well-argued, though AUTHENTICALLY BLACK would have been enhanced by an index and bibliography.    <br />I take exception to a previous reviewer's characterization of McWhorter's pages on Sharpton and Jesse Jackson as &quot;venomous attacks.&quot;  Venomous?  Hardly.  The passages are a compassionate and concise scrutiny of the &quot;achievements&quot; of those two figures.  Everyone should know just what the Rainbow Coalition and National Action Network are, and reading the last chapter in this book is a good start.  On balance, AUTHENTICALLY BLACK is a valuable addition to current debates.	2004-02-09

He delights his conservative audience by pouring his vitriol all over liberals, moderates, Bill Clinton, and anyone else who stands anywhere BESIDES right behind himself and the likes of George W. Bush.  <br />Sean Hannity is good at what he does.<br />Unfortunately, Sean is NOT very good with facts.  Sean gets them wrong all the time.  <br />For example, Sean repeats the falsehood that Bill Clinton &quot;seemingly blamed the vicious terrorist attacks on you and me and all Americans.&quot;  Kevin Cherry makes a similar mistake writing for NationalReviewOnline:  &quot;President Bill Clinton blamed, in part, the United States for the terrorist attacks of September 11. Speaking to a group of about 1,000 students, the former president said that our nation is &quot;paying a price&quot; for slavery and for its treatment of the &quot;significant number of native Americans&quot; who &quot;were dispossessed and killed.&quot; <br />If you look at the context, you'll see that Clinton meant that there is a long history of noncombatants dying in conflict, even in our own nation's history.  Tragically, innocent people get killed.   Sometimes they number in the thousands.  What happened at the WTC was terrible and ghastly, but it wasn't entirely without precedent But Hannity doesn't care.  He doesn't let facts get in his way.<br />That's just one example, but anybody reading LET FREEDOM RING  could find many many more.  Hannity is shameless and careless.  <br />Hannity's agenda seems to be:  spin the truth any way it can be spun, in order to make Republicans and conservatives look good, and make liberals and Democrats look bad.  Like I said, Hannity is amazing at what he does.  It's tragic that he uses his considerable talent to regularly lie or distort the truth.	2004-02-05

We're decades beyond the gains made in the civil rights movement, yet African-American students still lag behind their white counterparts--even those of the middle-class, even those that attend good schools, and even those with black teachers.  WHY?  Black students are as intelligent and capable as any students, so why such poor results?<br />LOSING THE RACE is McWhorter's attempt to explain what ails black students. McWhorter blames three demons:  Anti-intellectualism (African-Americans shying away from intellectual pursuits), separatism (avoiding activities that are deemed &quot;white&quot;), and victimology.   He doesn't say that ALL black students are dogged by these problems, but that many are.  Some contend that poor performance in schools is due to racism, but McWhorter contends that racism has declined since the 1960s, and asks if the occasional inconveniences suffered by most blacks are equal to the strangling racism that African-Americans lived with prior to 1960.  <br />McWhorter agrees that the poorest schools need improvements.  He suggests improving those schools by various means.  Importantly, he also suggests ending race-based affirmative action in school admissions.  Race-based affirmative action WAS very necessary, but has outlived its usefulness.   Now it stifles the efforts of black students, and doesn't allow them full credit for their achievements.  Does the African-American daughter of suburb-dwelling professionals really need affirmative action in order to gain admission to a good college?  McWhorter would say no.  <br />McWhorter devotes a chapter to the &quot;Ebonics&quot; controversy, which is also very entertaining and informative.  As an African-American linguist, he brings a special informed perspective to the debate.  His arguments are smart and well-reasoned.<br />Some have faulted LOSING THE RACE for being anecdotal.  Sure, the author used scores ofstories and anecdotes from his own life.  Some of the anecdotes and analogies are ill-chosen or seem exaggerated.  Others are inappropriate.  Many leave the reader shaking his head in anger and dismay.  Simultaneously these stories are the strongest and weakest suits of this book.  Without them, we would have dry statistics.  Who would read that?  In the stories, we have an professor's humane perspective on a serious problem.  <br />McWhorter puts forth a powerful argument in LOSING THE RACE. It is a well-written addition to the literature on this topic.  <br />ken32	2003-12-31

Sinister persons have plans for Mona and Angie:  they plot (apparently) to kidnap one and kill the other.  Cyberspace cowboys, Yakuza, Londoner thugs, and weird freakish types populate the plot, with The Finn from  COUNT ZERO playing a minor role in this novel as well.   Gibson, as always, manages to make the various plots converge at the end.  <br />Gibson's world is futuristic, both fantastic and somewhat scientifically plausible, dystopic and frightening.  London is trapped in a time warp.  Japan is shiny and ultra-modern.  Cleveland is a dump.  The Sprawl is forbidding, amazing, huge, and imposing.  Cyberspace is where everyone wants to be.   In MONA LISA OVERDRIVE, he mainly succeeds at delivering his vision and an entertaining plot. Kudos to Gibson for creating this amazing fictional universe; this is his forte.   I found the novel's ending somewhat confusing and unsatisfying.  Don't let me dissuade you! MONA LISA OVERDRIVE is a fine novel and a successful conclusion to The Sprawl Trilogy; however, if you're new to Gibson, start with BURNING CHROME (short stories) or NEUROMANCER.<br />ken32	2003-12-16

She IS a rational skeptic, diagnosing delusion wherever she finds it.  She ranges all over the map, where people believe in UFOs, &quot;doctors&quot; believe that your body is controlled by (or MADE OF) vibrational forces, etc.  Many people are eager to believe just about anything, partly because they don't apply critical thinking skills.<br />Others aren't exactly EAGER to believe anything, but they don't assess critically, and therefore they fall into the same trap.<br />This book is NOT anti-religious; it makes good points, and targets of Kaminer's examination range from New Age &quot;gurus&quot; to evangelicals to technology-cures-all types to irrational feminists.  A feminist herself, Kaminer points out how irrational claims have been woven into various feminist teachings, and how feminism has suffered and weakened as a result.  <br />She herself admits to using a homeopath.  Irrational?  Maybe.  Then the author astutely makes the distinction between choosing an unproven therapy for oneself vs. &quot;accepting untested personal testimony as public truth.&quot;  Indeed we are encouraged to accept that testimony every day, from all sides.  <br />Kaminer's writings on prayer in school, and the role of church-state separation, is illuminating and incisive.  She ably demonstrates the hazards of allowing public tax dollars to fund the dissemination of sectarian religious dogma.  OF COURSE there is already prayer in schools.  As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in schools, or so the saying goes.  Kaminer points out that some religious groups would like public voucher money to support religious schools.  Those same groups would be loathe to allow governmental monitoring of their curricula, however.  <br />In summary, Kaminer does a good job of dissecting various ills, at the heart ofwhich is a lack of critical thinking by consumers, readers, citizens, etc.  <br />One quibble:  somebody needs to learn how to SPELL.  I saw dozens of mistakes, and that is inexcusable.  Dioxen?  Comeraderie?  Let's try to do better next time.<br />ken32	2003-10-04

A benefactress, a citizen from the town's past, returns for a visit.  As it turns out, the wealthy woman will not donate freely, but only in return for the townspeople exacting some horrible deed.  As in his other plays, Durrenmatt wrote a fascinating plot which examines themes like revenge and responsibility.  <br />Durrenmatt novices should probably start with THE VISIT, his most famous play... if you've enjoyed THE VISIT, I will recommend my favorite among Durrenmatt's plays:  ROMULUS THE GREAT, which is scarce, but well worth a read.  <br />THE VISIT was adapted for the screen as a movie entitled THE HYENAS, set in Africa.  <br />Incidentally, the author's novel THE PLEDGE was also made into a movie, starring Jack Nicholson.  <br />ken32	2003-09-20

Pynchon's _Gravity's Rainbow_ is one of my favorite novels.  There, that's out of the way.  I will try to describe the novel for you.  <br />It's big.  The story is sprawling, all over Europe during the end of WWII, and following that war.  The characters are numerous.  The plot is ridiculous and absurd; the writing is beautiful.<br />Most importantly, the novel is funny.  I laughed aloud repeatedly.  It took me a month to read this book; at times it is grotesque and awful, and difficult to digest.  It is Pynchon's longest and most difficult-to-read novel.  Most similar to V., it is profane and never delicate.  The chaos and absurdity of war is revealed without precision, but with explosive mastery.<br />I recommend this novel, especially to fans of Neal Stephenson, John Barth, William Gass, and William S. Burroughs.  I also believe that Catch 22 fans will enjoy.<br />If you have read other novels by Thomas Pynchon, please also begin _Gravity's Rainbow_.  If you have not read others by Pynchon, start with his first novel _V._.  The title is just the letter V.	2003-09-11

The boat is besieged by pirates, but the crew intends to keep its pay (the payroll is targeted).  Based on a folk song, the plot is unpredictable, but moves slowly enough that young readers and listeners can understand it.  <br />The mule leads the mail boat's men to victory, and the pirates are defeated.  My son, aged four, usually roots for the pirates, of course, but The Erie Canal Pirates sees them defeated, and he's not disappointed.  I rate this as a nice companion book to other pirate picture books, such as Tough Boris, by Mem Fox.	2003-08-27

He turns them all down, then feels thirsty.  Only when a poor young boy offers him a drink of water does he show any gratitude.  He holds his water cup with pride and joy, and cherishes it beyond all matter of treasure.<br />Christopher Manson packed the pages with imagery.  Most pages are crowded with pictures of numerous Persians, dressed in traditional garb, accompanied by their objects of art and craft.  Drawn with brilliant detail, the illustrations convey a richly remembered (or imagined?) Persia of the past.  Most hues are some variety of brown, gold, or earthtone, giving Artaxerxes' desert journey a realistic look.  <br />The story is predictable, but the quality retelling, illustrations, and lesson more than offset that shortcoming.<br />_A Gift for the King_ is a valuable addition to any library, home or otherwise.<br />Ken32	2003-05-31

The trademark Wegman dogs, weimaraners, are photographed here in a variety of settings.  Chip, one of the weimaraners, is dressed like a human. Chip believes he IS a human, and he wants a dog.  Chip gazes longingly out a window at a dog, wishing he could own one.  A dog would make Chip happy, or so he thinks.  Chip's mother and father do not want a dog in the house, though.  <br />There are lots of humorous photographs here.  The illustrations are playful, and the expressions on the dogs' faces will bring you belly laughs. <br />Eventually, Chip realizes that he IS a dog (the truth comes to him in a dream), and that helps him resolve the conflict.<br />I recommend this to all children, and adults with a playful sense of the absurd.  <br />ken32	2003-05-14
US	50951948	R34S8ELOTK7JGJ	0394488792	854531432	Macbett: A play	Books	5	3	3	N	N	wry take on the Scottish play	Eugene Ionesco's MACBETT is a wry take on Shakespeare's MACBETH; it is a free adaptation with plenty of application to the modern era.<br />Much of the plot resembles that of the Shakespeare play, with some differences.  In the beginning, there is no Lady Macbett.  Instead, Lady Duncan conspires with Banco and Macbett to kill her husband, King Duncan.  Then she becomes Lady Macbett, as Macbett becomes king.  She actually tells Macbett to kill Duncan \\"if you want me...\\" (!)  <br />In Macbett, Ionesco portrays the nobility without nobility, The heroes without heroism, and when characters act idealistic, they are mocked.  The play opens with Candor and Glamiss  complaining about Duncan and going off to overthrow him.  At the battle, a lemonade seller walks the battlefield, vending his tangy beverages.  Macbett and Banco both confess to needless killing of many, including civilians.  When Duncan learns that his life is in danger, he cowers, asking \\"where can I hide?\\"  In a most hilarious scene, Duncan interviews a soldier.  Instead of a man who enlisted and is ready to do anything for the crown, this fellow was bullied into the army, and simply can't wait to get out.  He can't give accurate reports of battles and troop movements because he simply doesn't pay attention.  As I wrote earlier, the would-be heroes are not heroic.  The nobility is not noble.<br />Later when witches appear to Banco and Macbett, the men show some flashes of idealism, and the witches respond with mockery. I can't remember who says the line, but \\"nowadays autocracy isn't always the best way to govern\\" is a howler, and it says a lot about politics in every era.  Oh, and there are the crowds.  The rabble is fickle.  They always support the leader, no matter how he acts or what despicable deed he has done.  After the supposedly beloved Duncan is killed, the crowd chants \\"Long live Macbett; long live his bride!\\"<br />The action consists largely of conniving, political maneuvering, and backstabbing.In the end,  Macol gets revenge on Macbett.  Lo and behold, Macol ends up stabbing  Macbett in the back.  The witnesses, of course, are not horrified or dismayed at their beloved king's death.  They chant \\"long live Macol!\\"  Macol concludes the play with a speech, maintaining that, in all likeliness, he will be a despicable tyrant.  What a clever and hilarious ending. <br />I can't emphasize enough MACBETT had me laughing.  Ionesco made a very funny play, with trenchant, cutting remarks about politics and human nature then and now.  Shakespeare fans might disagree, but it seems that Ionesco wasn't mocking Shakespeare so much as lampooning the political realities of the 20th century (and perhaps the Elizabethan era).    MACBETT is mandatory reading for fans of Theatre of the Absurd, fans of Eugene Ionesco, and students of political science.<br />ken32	2003-04-22

Various animals, including a platypus and emu, tell him that a bunyip is ugly.  Eventually he meets a scientist who looks \\"right through\\" him, and tells him that bunyips don't exist.  Eventually he packs his belongings and hikes away from his home.  He comes upon a billabong, pitches camp, and lo and behold meets another bunyip.  The new bunyip is in need of the same friendship and reassurance that our first bunyip could have used at the beginning of the story.  <br />Themes explored here are the value of support and friendship, and the importance of self-esteem.  Also noted is the harm done by insults and indifference.  Far from being preachy, the author and illustrator skillfully weave the theme into the plot.<br />The illustrations are dark, and frequently are smaller than the page, framed in white.  They are reminiscent of Maurice Sendak. <br />The bunyip is no monster.  He's not the horrific ghoul portrayed in movies such as Dot and the Kangaroo.  He's an ugly but harmless patchwork of a beast, with mismatched body parts.  His attitude is one of bewilderment, hopefulness, and persistence.  I can't recommend this picture book highly enough.  USA residents should check their public libraries, because the book is currently out of print in the USA.<br />Ken32	2003-04-04

The text is very simple.  Basically, it simply states \\"Boris was greedy.\\" for one pair of pages, and then \\"All pirates are greedy.\\" on the next pair, and then substitutes other words for greedy, like \\"massive,\\" and \\"scruffy,\\" etc.  <br />The pictures tell the story, though.  Boris and his group find a treasure chest, filled with treasure and a violin.  The crew drags the treasure chest aboard the ship, and divvies up the loot.  A boy steals the violin from Boris's room, and Boris seeks the boy out for punishment.  The boy plays the violin so well, however, that Boris has him spared.  Next, Boris' pet parrot dies, and gets a solemn and appropriate burial at sea, in the violin case.  Boris and all the pirates are very sad, and, as the text states, \\"all pirates cry.\\"  <br />This book required repeated readings with my 3-year old to get the whole story.  The simple text says so little, but in the end the text complements the illustrations well.<br />Kathryn Brown's illustrations are wonderful.  The colors are bright, and the renderings of the pirates are fantastic.  They are the best pirates I've seen in over a dozen pirate picture books.    While I'm at it, I'll salute the author and illustrator together for creating a pirate picture book which doesn't include any battles, swordplay, cannons, or gunplay.  <br />I give _Tough Boris_ 5 stars.<br />ken32	2003-02-01

None of his crewmates enjoy working with Jake-- he's mean, cruel, and they are tired of stealing.  Each has his own aspirations.  The bosun wants to guide large cargo ships, the cook wants to be a chef on a large passenger ship, and the cabin boy wants to be a fisherman.<br />Jake's ship steals a whopping load of booty from, in turn, a cargo ship, a passenger ship, and a fishing vessel.  Each time, in order to keep his ship from sinking under the weight of the loot, Jake tosses one of his crew members overboard to the other vessel.    <br />So, in the end, the bosun, cabin boy, and cook all get their wishes.  Jake's ship, however, sinks under the weight of all that treasure.<br />One Eyed Jake's illustrations are not terribly good, but the text is fun to read, and my son's interest is held throughout.

Sometimes his imagination carries him away.  Usually he gets involved in a book, and then he imagines himself in the plot, or imagines the plot coming to life.  Then he goes to one of his favorite places, the library.  He finds a book on pirates which begins \\"Some pirate treasure has never been found.\\"  Later, Edward takes the book home, begins to read, and then sometime during the night he imagines a pirate adventure which involves his library book, his parents, and a gang of ruthless-looking (but tame enough for a toddler) pirates.  <br />The illustrations are very dark, yet this works to the book's advantage.  My son has asked me to read _Edward and the Pirates_ to him a dozen times (my son is 3 1/2 years old), and he often finds new details amidst the dark illustrations.  <br />The book sends a wonderful message about libraries (use them!) and reading (do it!) and imagination (use that too!), not to mention parents (they're the good guys!) and the imaginary episode is clearly written into the plot.  Even my son realizes that there aren't really pirates in Edward's bedroom.  <br />My son is intensely interested in pirates, and _Edward and the Pirates_ entertains him.  The book sends wonderful messages while telling a strong story.  <br />Highly recommended.  <br />ken32	2003-01-20

Arthur is very scared at first, but he learns to overcome his fears along the way.  Only D.W. is brave enough to approach the \\"witch's\\" house, but then Arthur and D.W. learn that the \\"witch\\" is really just a misunderstood elderly lady with a messy house and yard.<br />Arthur's Halloween is about trick-or-treating, mainly, and there is no mention of Halloween parades, bobbing for apples, or other Halloween traditions.  If your children are afraid of trick-or-treating, this book may help them to escape their fear.<br />Often characters in Arthur videos and books daydream or imagine episodes, and I find that those episodes are presented in a way that my three year old finds confusing.  He does not distinguish between the trappings of characters' imaginations and the regular plot.  Now I know that I can add commentary so that he understands that certain elements in a book are just the dreams of a character.<br />For example, in Arthur's Halloween, some of the kids imagine that the \\"witch\\" is harming Arthur and D.W. in several different ways.  When a toddler sees illustrations of the \\"witch\\" doing such things, he believes it just as he believes the rest of the plot.  I have learned that I can say \\"Francine (or The Brain, or Buster, etc.)just THINKS this is happening.  It's not really happening, is it?\\"  Then my child doesn't confuse the \\"real\\" plot with the characters' fanciful thoughts.<br />In any case, Arthur's Halloween is not a bad Halloween picture book, and even if you steer your child away from \\"series\\" books or books allied with television series, give this one a try.<br />ken32	2002-12-27

The plan is the best part of the book... the author sets forth a plan for recovery, including a plan for what to do if you feel like going on a binge.  <br />Besides the plan, the author makes helpful points throughout the book, like:<br />about alcohol-- \\"if you drink excessively you will not be able to make full use of this program\\" <br />about overeating just once-- \\"no one meal can have a significant effect on your weight\\"<br />about how you're not alone-- \\"enlist the assistance (with the meal plan) of a close friend or relative\\"<br />about laxatives--  \\"laxatives are wholly ineffective as a method for losing weight or compensating for overeating\\"<br />about binging and its effect on weight -- \\"the number of calories absorbed from binges, even after vomiting, is greater than what would have been absorbed in a binge-free day during which normal meals and snacks would have been eaten\\"<br />about eating normal meals-- \\"it is usual that people who replace a pattern of dieting and binge-eating with regular meals do not gain weight.\\"<br />The bottom line:  this book by Peter Cooper is easy to use, and the points in it are sound, for those suffering from bulimia, binge-eating, even others who have unsound eating habits.	2002-05-27

Lisa Venus, James Beeze, and Elmer Gravlaky are curious children indeed.  They LOVE numbers and materials, and they've all got their little strange behaviors, but they act like children.  The classroom scenes are FUNNY.  The kids sass each other and the teacher in quite realistic fashion.  <br />This book was recommended to me by a friend, someone who seemingly has excellent taste in books, and I was not disappointed.  It seems like a fantasy, a fairy tale, sometimes.  There is a lack of realistic detail almost everywhere.  But most of the dialogue and something else intangible about the story rings true... I can't quite put my finger on it.  The story is very enjoyable, I'll give it that.<br />This story is slight and quick-- I read it very quickly... and I recommend you take a look also.<br />ken32	2002-05-08

The story includes trick-or-treating, a Halloween parade, and other Halloween traditions also.  <br />The illustrations are like those in the other Angelina books: nicely drawn, cutesy, and cluttered with images.  There's a lot to see on each page.  Often my son just likes to explore the illustrations, naming the items on each page, and asking questions.  <br />Angelina's Halloween is one of many good Halloween storytime (or bedtime) books for preschool aged children.   I recommend it.<br />ken32	2002-05-06

A mummy, a vampire, a ghost and a bat each stop by and try to pull the pumpkin from the vine.  They succeed when they all pull together.  Later they share the pumpkin pie.<br />Schindler's illustrations are hilarious.  The image of the mummy trying to pull the pumpkin from the vine is one i will never forget... the image of the bat eating pumpkin pie is another one.  Both I and my (3 year old) son find this book very funny.  The story is simple and repetitive...there is nothing really scary or morbid here at all. <br />In my opinion, this is an ideal Halloween picture book for 3- and 4-year olds.	2002-04-24

He loved Motley Crue, Guns n Roses, and Bon Jovi.  If you're going to like this book, you better had like those bands too.<br />Klosterman is without a doubt a good writer.  _Fargo Rock City_ made me laugh out loud a few times.  It's not only humorous, but it's captivating (at times) and true to the subject.  I grew up in the 1980s also, and, while I listened to lots of other pop music (i.e. Talking Heads, The Clash, Go-Go's, etc.) just as much, I definitely had a jones for pop-metal.  <br />Fargo Rock City definitely has a down side, though.  Self-indulgent to the point of parody at times, it seems like less a chronicle of 1980s heavy metal fandom than it does the Chuck Klosterman Story.  The author spends a good 1/3 of the pages trying to justify his own musical taste.   Granted, many of us born between 1963 and 1973 listened to early Van Halen, and look back on it with fondness-- heck, we even turn the radio up when we hear it again.  But how many of us would do that with Guns n Roses song \\"November Rain\\" ?  or something by Poison?  Klosterman would.  It seems like Klosterman enjoyed most of his 1980s heavy metal because he listened to it all the time, he drank a lot, and there was nothing else to do in his little North Dakota town.  No surprise there, but Klosterman comes up with an argument why all of that music was good.  Bad idea.<br />However, Klosterman is the perfect person to write a book about growing up a child of 1980s pop metal.  He's smart, witty, and has a hell of a memory.  He had given himself an impossible task, though:  cast a fond look back Quiet Riot, Bon Jovi, and their peers, AND write about it intelligently, WITHOUT making it look stupid.  <br />And in a sense, you had to be there. By \\"there\\" I don't mean North Dakota, but living as a hair-metal fan in the mid- or late 1980s small town America. If _FargoRock City_ had been about 1970s rock, I definitely wouldn't have been interested... I doubt many young 20somethings would be interested in reading about the adolescent journey of Klosterman, since they didn't grow up with his music.<br />Still, this is a funny book, more than worthwhile if you grew up on the likes of Def Leppard, Quiet Riot, and Bon Jovi.  Klosterman seems to be a regular guy with a lot of heart, not to mention he's funny.<br />Rock on, Chuck Klosterman.  <br />ken32	2002-03-28

This is confusing for preschoolers.  Older children won't mind when the very first page opens with \\"I'm Emily Elizabeth, the cat\\" but younger readers are confused.  The same page shows a picture of a dog, and the little girl is wearing a cat costume.  Honestly, the dog looks more like a cat than Emily Elizabeth does!  <br />The pictures are NOT really humorous.  They seem hastily assembled, and truly there are dozens of picture books for young children about Halloween which are very worthwhile.  Sadly enough, this book just seems to be trading on the popularity of the Clifford, The Big Red Dog character.<br />Clifford's First Halloween is a picture book which doesn't have much to offer.  <br />ken32	2002-03-18

Who knew?  He tried jobs such as zookeeper (where he learned to love reindeer), postal worker (where he decided to deliver packages at night, to save time!), and chimney sweep (where he never got dirty, prompting suspicion that he wasn't doing his work).  <br />This book takes NOTHING away from the traditional Santa Claus stories... it merely fills in the details about what Santa did as a young man, before becoming the rotund, jolly, white-bearded Christmas giftbringer that we love so much.<br />The illustrations are humorous and playful; the text is easy to understand.  My son is almost 3 years old, and he loves this book!  I think _How Santa Got His Job_ is the perfect compliment to Clement Moore's _The Night Before Christmas_-- read it to your child, and see for yourself.  It's a treat.<br />ken32<BR>-----	2002-03-08

Fresh from big city schools in Seoul, he expects to earn the highest marks and the respect of his peers.  Instead, he encounters a classroom bully in the form of Om Sokdae, the tallest of his classmates.  Om Sokdae extorts food, candy, and prized possessions from the other children.  He has managed this for years, and no longer has to resort to violence to gain what he wants.  Om Sokdae holds his classmates in terror.  Worse, the teacher will not intervene.  His orderly class is to his liking.<br />_Our Twisted Hero_ is the story of how Han Pyongtae copes with this situation.  In such a short book the author has provided a powerful story with a powerful message.  <br />American readers will be fascinated by this glimpse inside Korean society and the Korean school system.  But this is not just a Korean story-- Han Pyongtae's story seems universal.  His struggle is not only with the bully, but with the perceptions of the other children, feelings of injustice, and the confidence of his parents.  Hopefully, teenagers and adults all over the world will find _Our Twisted Hero_ and benefit by it as I have.  A marvelous little story.<br />ken32	2002-02-23

Curious George Goes to an Ice Cream Shop was not written by H.A. Rey, the creator of Curious George.  Rather, the book was adapted from a Curious George video.  <br />Still, it's a great story. <br />The Man With the Yellow Hat leaves George in the custody of Mr. Herb, at Mr. Herb's new ice cream shop.  When George is unattended, he jumps on the counter, and begins adding scoops of various flavors to Mr. Herb's order!  Later, he hops onto a counter near a window looking into the street.  His antics draw a crowd of onlookers, and suddenly Mr. Herb has more ice cream orders than he can handle!<br />As always, the mischievous George escapes any real trouble, while having a lot of fun.

His subject:  invertebrates, with about ten different chapters on different creatures, such as leeches, dragonflies, tarantulas, etc.  NOT ALL POPULAR INVERTEBRATES ARE COVERED IN THIS BOOK.  In fact, if there is not a chapter devoted to your favorite invertebrate, there will be little or no information on that beast.  There are many examples.  Jellyfish, starfish, bees, crabs, clams, octopuses and lobsters are but a few that Conniff chose not to cover.<br />If you need detailed information about an invertebrate not covered in this book, or if you need more detail, I advise you to seek out a book on that specific beast.  Also, you can look into Robert Barnes' book _Invertebrate Zoology_, but that book...is best used at a public or college library.<br />On the plus side:  there aren't many good books on invertebrates for a general audience, and _Spineless Wonders_ is one of them.  Most folks, while they might be able to stomach ten or twenty pages on leeches, don't want an entire book on leeches.  In fact, most full length books on leeches, dragonflies, etc. are indeed academic tracts targeted at serious collectors or graduate students and professors.<br />Conniff's writing is usually lucid and entertaining.  He held my attention until the end of each chapter... almost.  Still, there isn't much popular writing on invertebrates in general, so _Spineless Wonders_ is well worth a look.<br />ken32	2002-01-12

When I read this book in 1990, or thereabouts, I had only read William Burroughs' book Junky, and I had read nothing by Jack Kerouac or Allen Ginsberg. <br />After I finished reading Literary Outlaw, by Ted Morgan, I was so fascinated that I read all of Burroughs' novels, and several books by Kerouac and Ginsberg. I also read two more Burroughs biographies, just to get more information on this weird old guy. <br />Literary Outlaw is just that good.<br />There are newer biographies of Burroughs by Barry Miles and also Graham Caveney. Nevertheless, Literary Outlaw remains the definitive Burroughs biography written to date.<br />This is a fascinating biography that reads like a pageturning novel. Burroughs grew up in a privileged St. Louis family, spent some time at a rough ranch-style boarding school in New Mexico, attended Harvard, travelled in Europe, and lived in New York, Mexico, New Orleans, Texas, Tangier, London, New York (again), and finally Kansas. Along the way he became the most scandalous figure in modern letters. His adventures and misadventures are related in this marvelous book. <br />Literary Outlaw is more exhaustive than either Caveney's or Miles' biographies. Chapters with titles like \\"Tangier: 1954-1958\\" and \\"The London Years: 1966-1973\\" make for easy navigation. As the book's coverage ends in 1988, there is no information on Burroughs' life in the 1990s, but the essays in the book Word Virus (by James Grauerholz) act as a good supplement, for biographical information. <br />Morgan did a good job. He wrote a page-turning biography, but not at the expense of Burroughs' literary reputation. Burroughs' value as a writer is challenged throughout, and it holds up. Biographical detail is linked to popular criticism of the texts. There is an extensive section of notes. There is an index. <br />You can't go wrong with this biography. If you've never read a biography of William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, or Allen Ginsberg, I advise you to try Literary Outlaw.This book is very well written, and is probably the most fascinating biography I have ever read.<br />ken32	2002-01-11

There is good background on Burroughs' childhood, a good bit of biographical detail throughout, and the book doesn't delve into the written works all too deeply.  Being one of three general biographies written about Burroughs, it bears comparing to the books by Ted Morgan and Graham Caveney.  Miles' book is not as scholarly or exhaustive as Morgan's book, Literary Outlaw, but is both more scholarly and more exhaustive than Caveney's, Gentleman Junkie.  It was written after Literary Outlaw, so there is more information on the Kansas years here, including a chapter entitled &quot;Shotgun Art&quot;.   <br />This is a biography intended for a general readership.  Miles' familiarity with his subject may make this of interest even to the Burroughs beginner.  There is a bibliography of works written by Burroughs (but none about him), and an index.  <br />Miles seems to be Burroughs' biggest fan.  This is not a critical appraisal of Burroughs OR his works.  At times the writing is very bad.  Still, Miles had the advantage of a fascinating subject.<br />If you haven't read a book about Burroughs before, read Literary Outlaw, by Ted Morgan, and pass this one up.<br />ken32	2002-01-11

Burroughs	Books	3	4	5	N	N	interesting visual layout, without any insight	Caveney's Gentleman Junkie, published in the United Kingdom under the title  The Priest They Called Him, is the MTV Video of the Burroughs biographies.  <br />The layout of the book is visually stunning, often placing images of Burroughs' paintings, Burroughs himself, Burroughs' friends, or collages of his work underneath, behind, along with, or beside the text.    If you've read the Barry Miles biography of Burroughs, or Literary Outlaw by Ted Morgan, there is nothing here in the pre-1980 material that you haven't read already.  <br />The chief virtue of Gentleman Junkie is the remarkable layout, which makes the book an artwork unto itself.  The secondary virtue lies in the fact that it was published in 1998, many years after the Morgan and Miles biographies, and thus includes some info on an era those works missed.   A list of Burroughs' works is appended, as is a skeletal index.  <br />While this book is interesting to look at, I would recommend Ted Morgan's book LITERARY OUTLAW as a better biography of Burroughs.  <br />ken32	2002-01-11

Burroughs (Twayne's United States Authors Series)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	nice little academic analysis	Skerl's book is a volume in the Wayne's United States Authors Series.  This slender volume is an attempt to write a reader-friendly introduction to Burroughs' writing and  a non-specialist's analysis of Burroughs' literature, as well as to delineate Burroughs' spot in the larger canon, our outside it.  It is well written and would serve as an excellent source to supplement Ted Morgan's biography LITERARY OUTLAW.<br />Skerl's thesis is that Burroughs' fiction is an expression oriented within hipsterism as a world-view. The book has a bibliography and an index.  Bibliography also includes a selection of journal articles the author finds of value.<br />All in all, this would be a nice supplement to LITERARY OUTLAW by Ted Morgan, if the reader wishes to have a reasonable academic analysis of some of Burroughs' fiction.<br />ken32	2002-01-11

Ginsberg, and William Burroughs.  Each section can be read independently of the others, for those just interested in one writer.<br />I was most interested in the chapter on Burroughs, and here is an appraisal:<br />A short introductory chapter on Burroughs gives biographical background.  The Burroughs section of Naked Angels is entitled &quot;The Black Beauty of William Burroughs,&quot; and is a 29-page exploration of Burroughs' writing, with useful comparisons to other writers, such as Poe, Baudelaire, and Nabokov.  Tytell analyzes the work Burroughs published from 1953-1973, omitting or including only the slightest references to minor works.  Early works which went unpublished for years, such as Queer and Interzone, are not discussed.  The book has an index and bibliography.  Tytell's book is not wholly given over to Burroughs, but as an introduction to the writer, it serves as well as any other.<br />If you have read the section on Naked Angels dealing with Burroughs, and you are eager for a more complete investigation of his life, turn to Ted Morgan's book LITERARY OUTLAW, which I believe to be the most thorough and fascinating biography of Burroughs.<br />ken32	2002-01-11

He carried water daily from the creek in the valley.  When an older, skinny monk arrives, they try to carry the water together, but with no luck, because one monk is much taller than the other one. <br />A fat monk then arrives, and each monk then believes that the water chore can be done without him.  As a result, no water is  carried to the house, and a fire starts the next day.  All three monks pull together to extinguish the fire, and they fairly divvy up the chores from that day on.<br />My 2 1/2 year old son likes this book.  While it is probably most suitable for older children, an inquisitive child will be fascinated with the peculiarities of the monastic life portrayed in this book. It's not every day a toddler sees a book about monks!<br />Of course, the fire is quite exciting as well.<br />ken32	2001-12-27

I'm sure some young children will be interested in the book for the unusual shape and the colorful photographs.  But there must be better books about seahorses out there; this book was poorly planned.<br />It's a board book.  These are for children up to age 3.  Many 2 year old children do perfectly well with paper books, also.  However, the text is not written on the level of a 2 or 3 year old.  With an adult reading &quot;seahorses swim upright,&quot; I think most every 2 year old will have no idea what the word &quot;upright&quot; means.  <br />Not only is the vocabulary poorly chosen, so is the content.  One page expresses this fact: young seahorses take the same shape as the adult seahorses.  (In the marine world, this is remarkable, especially when contrasted with clams, sponges, and other animals which have drastically differing larval and adult stages).  But a child of two years old doesn't know that!  The familiar newborn animals to the two year old (horse, cat, dog, elephant, monkey, fish, bird) ALWAYS look like the parents.  <br />It's not a good informational source on seahorses, and it's only 8 pages long, and small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.  It's just not a very worthwhile book.<br />ken32	2001-12-05

She finds out that her secretarial job is in a business which exists as a front for a recruiting station, where men are duped into being sucked into the distant future, to fight in a battle for all of Earth. Indeed, Norma's lover/boyfriend Garson is caught up in just this. The man who hires Norma is a tall, powerful, and callous individual named Dr. Lell. <br />Apparently, Dr. Lell is one of the (try not to laugh) &quot;Masters of Time.&quot; <br />Part of the novel concerns Norma's plight and efforts; part of the novel concerns Garson's attempts to get back to his own time in history. When Norma fails to cooperate with Dr. Lell, she is &quot;aged&quot; years into the future. As she cooperates, she &quot;earns&quot; years, and she appears to get younger. <br />By and large this novel is sloppily written and pockmarked with atrociously bad phrasing and sci-fi jargon. <br />Here is one example: &quot;The destruction of Tentacles 1601, 2, and 3 and the neutralization of electron molds could have only been accomplished with the assistance of a mind reader.&quot;<br />In places, the author's description of an individual character's plight is moving. He describes desperate situations very well. The beings, such as Dr. Lell, who assemble and use the machines to create these armies are ruthless, harsh, and cold. Scenes where these beings are summarizing the fate of the mere humans are striking and memorable. <br />So I suppose the entire book is not a waste. _Masters of Time_ is a slender novel, something you can probably read in three hours or so.

It's a short, well-reasoned introduction to the Taliban.<br />Chapters on The Mujahaddin illuminate the Afghan-Soviet War, and the Islamic Resistance.  Marsden comes to tell how several specific factions within Afghanistan were recognized by the government of Pakistan...then, American weaponry was channeled through Pakistan to those groups.  After the Soviet-Afghan war, those groups fought among themselves for power in Afghanistan.  Years later, out of the chaos sprang the Taliban.<br />There are other good chapters on the history of Afghanistan in general, The Taliban creed, earlier movements in Afghanistan, Taliban's relationship with the rest of the world, esp. humanitarian agencies in Afghanistan, and the gender policies of the Taliban.  <br />Marsden's angle is definitely one of cultural relativism.  He repeatedly asserts that the Taliban are operating out of a totally different value system than the &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;Western&quot; world.  Humanitarian agencies are serving in a country where women cannot vote, work as they wish, drive, or walk uncovered in public.  Indeed, women have been beaten for violating the strict public dress code.  However, Marsden states, common ground must be found, if there is to be any humanitarian aid at all.  The author also reminds us that our view of Islam and The Taliban is colored by our place in the world, our &quot;Western&quot; biases, et cetera.  <br />All in all, this is a good introduction to the Taliban.  I'm not sure if I can agree with the author's assessment of how many Afghans actually support the Taliban, but generally this is a good introductory book on the subject.  The book is short and to the point.  There is a helpful chronology in the front, and a short bibliography and index are in the back.  <br />If you're only going to read one book on The Taliban, you could do worse.<br />Ken32	2001-09-30

He conducts a city bus (he's not passed the driving test, indeed he doesn't even have a driver's license). His job is mind-numbingly boring, his supervisors are daft, and his life is just one lousy day after another. <br />The weather is horrid. His companions tell the stupidest and worst jokes and tales.<br />R. Hines regularly shows up late for work, or forgets his hat, and is always in trouble with his supervisors. He's regularly skipping work for one reason or another. Always on the brink of being canned. <br />Still, he has a lovely wife (who is understandably upset with his work performance), and a charming little toddler boy. They're not going anywhere fast. Hines wants a better life for his family, but they're not going to get it. <br />Your man Hines, though, he's got a brain, and a biting sense of humor. This, along with a bit of drink, gets him through each day. <br />Some have written that Irvine Welsh (_Trainspotting_) read _The Busconductor Hines_, which demonstrated to him the possibility of writing in his own Scottish voice, about the real people of Scotland. I can believe that. <br />James Kelman has created one of the greatest characters you'll ever read-- Rabbie Hines.<br /> ken32	2001-09-23

Archie and Peter then put on a street show, and the cat jumps inside Archie's paper bag costume, and the show is over!  The cat ruined the performance!<br />This is another solid book from Ezra Jack Keats. Archie is also a character in his _Whistle for Willie_, and several others. Peter is the same character from _Whistle for Willie_, _Peter's Chair_, and _A Letter to Amy_. <br />Archie shows how to make the best of a bad situation, and the characters show cleverness and ingenuity. The sense of playful spontaneity is probably better conveyed here than in Keats' other books. Highly recommended.<br />Ken32	2001-09-05

In Scene One, a prostitute and a soldier meet up and he attempts to seduce her. She arranges to meet him the next day, but they immediately have sex on a riverbank. His face is hidden. The soldier treats her callously. In Scene Two, our soldier is with a maid in a park, he seduces her and they have sex. Again, his face is hidden. He treats her like an animal. He moves on to the next woman. <br />In Scene Three, our maid is at the home of a young gentleman. The gentleman and the maid have sex, then the gentleman leaves. In Scene Four, the young gentleman and the young wife have sex. (she is married, but not to him....) He makes elaborate preparations before the encounter. They make a big deal of their relationship. She says that she loves him. They plan to meet again. <br />In Scene Five, our young wife and her husband are present. Husband tells the wife how hard it is to be a man, how sexual insecurity must be overcome before marriage (what a trial!). The wife challenges him on his double standard. She calms down and they have sex. He tells her everything she wants to hear. In Scene Six, the husband entertains the sweet young miss. In a dining room, no less. Of course, they have sex. The husband is challenged on another double standard. He wants to know if the lady is married, but she isn't supposed to have the same curiousity. He calms her, and she warms back up to him; they plan to do it again in a more private setting. <br />In Scene Seven, our sweet young miss is busy with a poet. The poet acts like an artistic type. They profess their mutual love. They have sex. He says that he is Biebitz, and he says that he's not. She doesn't care. They act like they are in love. They part. In Scene Eight, our poet is actively romancing an actress in a country inn. The actress is difficult; she makes the poet leave, call up to the window, then he returns to bed. She puzzles him witha riddle, then, in a shocking turn, they have sex. The actress and the poet then bicker about plays, acting, and performances. <br />In Scene Nine, our actress meets up with the Count, this in the actress' bedroom. The Count is a pompous braggart, but that doesn't stop them from having sex. They are both happy with it and decide to do it again. In the final scene, the count meets up with the girl of the streets (from scene one). He is sitting on the sofa; she is in bed. Apparently, they have already had sex. He acts as if he doesn't believe that he's done it. He tries to advise her on her career and way of life, then reflects that all women are after money. He decides that he likes the honest approach, and announces that he will return. As the count leaves, he and the maid trade greetings. <br />The playwright apparently was making fun of the Viennese sexual code of the day, which must have been a sort of &quot;everyone does it, but no one talks about it&quot; scene. He portrays a society of shallow narcissists, interested only in pleasure and the maintenance of appearances. Along the way, Schnitzler challenges several assumptions regarding sexual behavior and gender.<br />I suppose all this was scandalous and forward-thinking for early 20th century Vienna, but it's boring and predictable now. The dialogue of the play is often interesting, but it doesn't rise above interesting in most of the scenes.	2001-08-28

One diva in particular is Cynthia Hawkins, an American opera singer who has never made a recording. Jules secretly records one Cynthia Hawkins concert, and shares the tape with his teenaged friend Alba, who shares the tape with her (adult) companion Serge. <br />Serge is a career criminal. In his mid 30's, he shares his life with Alba, a precocious teenage beauty whom he has \\"liberated\\" from parental control. Serge has an idea to make a great deal of money from the Cynthia Hawkins tape. Meanwhile, Nadia is a 27 year old who works for Saporta. Saporta controls the largest narcotics and prostitution ring in Paris. Nadia records harmful evidence against Saporta on a cassette tape. Nadia's cassette is erroneously dropped into Jules' satchel (on his motorbike). <br />Soon, Jules is being chased by the cops, as well as gangsters, though he has no idea why. Saporta mobilizes his entire crime organization to retrieve the tape from Jules. Locating Jules in Paris is not easy. There are cops and gangsters combing paris for Jules and the tape of Nadia's accusations. There is also a furious underground bidding war for Jules' tape of Cynthia Hawkins' concert. All this is taking place at a brisk pace, and makes for a fun if unbelievable novel.  This novel has a lot of flashy style; it reminds me a bit of the American crime writer Raymond Chandler. <br />DIVA is not a gritty, realistic crime novel. It's all flash and style, excitement and cartoonish characters. I enjoyed DIVA, but I don't know if I'll read any more of Delacorta's novels.<br />Perhaps. This books was so short and sweet, reading it was like eating candy. I don't expect I'll remember much about the plot of this book tomorrow, or even in one week. It's a lot like the crime novels you might find in an airport bookstore... a few hours of harmless entertainment...<br />ken32	2001-08-25

But where IS the cat? Archie can't find it, so Peter, Roberto, and Susie reluctantly go to the pet show without him. <br />Ensuring that each contestant is a winner, the judges give out blue ribbons to everyone, creating categories on the fly, such as &quot;cat with the longest whiskers,&quot; &quot;friendliest fish,&quot; etc. Archie finally arrives, but an old woman shows up just as Archie is displaying his hasty last-second entry (a jar, containing a germ). Beside the old woman is Archie's cat. The old woman is given the blue ribbon for displaying the cat. <br />Archie displays good humor and grace. The old woman offers the blue ribbon to Archie, but he insists that she keep it. Archie and his friends all enjoy themselves.<br />Like most of Ezra Jack Keats' books, _Pet Show_ is populated with children and adults of several ethnicities, but primarily African-American. The book design is marvelous. Basically the book looks like _A Letter To Amy_ and _Whistle for Willie_.<br />My son and I read this one all the time. He's almost 2 1/2 years old, and while I expect that most children are enjoying this at age 4 and age 5, my son thoroughly loves it. When we reach the section where Archie is late for the pet show, he almost can't contain himself until he sees Archie's silhouette racing along, jar in hand, and he belts out &quot;Here Goes Archie!&quot;-- _Pet Show_ is a winner.<br />Ken32	2001-08-18

The introduction by Lillian Hellman gives the reader excellent insight into her relationship with Hammett, as well as a glimpse of the author.  For Hammett fans, the book is nearly worth the price for Hellman's introduction alone.<br />This collection is better than his Maltese Falcon, all the Sam Spade,  and the Thin Man stories. Among Hammett's writings, the only novel to equal this collection, in my mind, is _Red Harvest_.  <br />Stories in this book range from short to near-novella length.  Topics range from the very typical Hammett plot (young woman is missing, wealthy dad pays for her return)of &quot;The Gatewood Caper&quot; to the offbeat noir-Western &quot;Corkscrew&quot; to the looting of an entire island (&quot;The Looting of Couffignal&quot;).    <br />The one &quot;straight&quot; story in the bunch, not a crime story at all, is &quot;Tulip,&quot; published as a fragment.  As it is, it doesn't pull much weight.  To call the plot meandering would be generous. <br />The title story is a classic.  A big bank-robbery caper starts looking bizarre when, days later, roomsful of America's highest profile crooks start turning up dead.<br />One bad story doesn't ruin the whole bunch.  If you're a fan of Hammett's other books, give _The Big Knockover_ a chance.  <br />ken32	2001-07-10

My two-year old and I both love his other books, like Goggles, A Letter To Amy, and Whistle for Willie.<br />_Peter's Chair_ is something of a disappointment.  Drawn in the same style as his other titles, it's the story of Peter, who becomes an older brother for the first time.  He rebels when he finds out that all his baby things are being reassigned to the baby girl, and given a fresh coat of PINK paint.  Eventually he comes to accept that he's got to share the spotlight, and all is well.<br />When a younger sibling is born, it's nearly always a struggle for the older child to learn to share the parental attention.  This is a common issue dealt with in children's books.  Sad to say, it isn't dealt with very well in this book.  _Peter's Chair_ just isn't a very good story, and children of the 1990s and later, who can't see that PINK MUST EQUAL GIRL and BLUE MUST EQUAL BOY are going to be confused by this implication.<br />Please, go look at the author's other titles:  Goggles, A Letter To Amy, and Whistle for Willie, among others.  They are most wonderful books by Ezra Jack Keats.  Sad to say, I can only give _Peter's Chair_ 3 stars.<br />ken32	2001-07-03

I brought home _A Letter To Amy_ from the library to let him have a look.  <br />_A Letter To Amy_ is the story of Peter, who has an upcoming birthday.  He wants to invite Amy with a letter, because she's a special friend.  Peter is worried that the boys at his party won't like Amy because she's a girl.  He writes a letter to Amy, and tries to mail it.<br />This book has the same illustration style as Whistle for Willie... very patchy, abstract, and easy to enjoy.  The story is great.

Instead, Sumire falls in love with Miu, a mysterious older woman.  Though they're never what you'd actually call a couple, Sumire ventures to join Miu at work, and they travel to Europe, where Sumire disappears &quot;like smoke,&quot; as Murakami writes.  Our narrator is summoned from Japan to help solve the mystery.<br />If there's a central theme, it might be the examination of loneliness, and how people try to meet, and nearly meet, but never quite do so.  Though Murakami doesn't hide this below the surface, his style is such that the reader never feels as if attending a lecture, but rather it resembles listening to the all-too-seldom musings aloud of a very wise, close friend.<br />A never-consummated relationship, a close relationship between  one who is madly in love and another who has no such desire to take &quot;that step,&quot; is the source of great sadness and lonesomeness.  I've not encountered a writer yet who writes of this as well as Haruki.<br />If you've read Norwegian Wood, Sputnik Sweetheart should hold few surprises for you.  It has the simple story structure of Norwegian Wood, and indeed many of the plot elements are very similar.  But there is a shadowy, creeping supernatural flavor to the novel also, an otherworldliness that reminds me of _A Wild Sheep Chase_ or _Wind-up Bird Chronicle_.  <br />IF YOU'RE NEW TO HARUKI MURAKAMI:  I wouldn't start with Sputnik  Sweetheart.  He's written many wonderful novels, and I would recommend _Norwegian Wood_ or _A Wild Sheep Chase_ instead:   _Norwegian Wood_ because it's simply a better all-around novel,  and _A Wild Sheep Chase_ because it's a better introduction to Haruki's work.  <br />Sputnik Sweetheart is a little delicacy, a short and bittersweet treat.  I eagerly await Haruki's nextwork.<br />ken32	2001-06-22

He reviews practically every Clash record:  LPs, singles, B-sides, and CDs, not to mention CD tributes by other bands.<br />2) some insidery gossip on the clash, including stories about how the songs came about.  This background is great, as it tends to make the band seem like ordinary guys, and they seem a lot more fun once you've read these anecdotes.<br />3) the longish essay at the back of the book is very good, and I read it with relish even after the book had annoyed me to that point.  This essay is very well written.  <br />now here are the rubs:<br />1) the author's catty and immature tone:  he calls &quot;guns on the roof&quot; SILLY, the u.s. version of their debut album &quot;mangled, bizarre&quot; (despite the fact that only four tracks are different from the U.K. version), and the book is full of insults and condemnations of anything else the author cares to take a potshot at, like U.K. radio, U.S.A. radio, EMI (USA), and Rolling Stone magazine.  <br />2) Often the author just doesn't know what he's talking about. <br />He can't be more in the dark about The Clash when he writes this about Death or Glory-- &quot;The Clash's self-obsession is never funnier than on Death or Glory.  They were a band, not a cavalry regiment, for goodness sake.&quot;  For crying out loud, it's a song making fun of that VERY attitude.  <br />Check this out about The Clash and Sting:  &quot;They may have not been very good at reggae when they started but they invented a musical form that allowed Sting to become rich.&quot;<br />What?  The Police worked out their reggaeish sound before The Clash did.  Does he mean Sting's solo records, which are jazz-inflected pop?  Geez, I hope not.  But it seems you just can't tell, with this author.<br />3) He's repetitive.<br />Quantick calls Hitsville U.K. (I admit, it's not a good song) an &quot;all-time artistic low.&quot; Fair enough.  But then later in the book he calls the same song &quot;insanely bad.&quot;  Gotcha, Dave.  A few pages later, Quantick must have had the urge to use the same modifier again, so he calls the same song &quot;insanely dreadful.&quot; Please.<br />If you have to own everything Clash, you'll get this book no matter what I say, I suppose.  <br />If you don't, and you'd like something more substantial than Quantick's book, I recommend Marcus Gray's book called LAST GANG IN TOWN:  STORY AND MYTH OF THE CLASH.<br />ken32	2001-06-20

They were born to the same mother but different fathers.  Their mom was a 1960s sexually liberated hippie.  Raised by different grandmothers, they are somewhat getting to know one another as adults, although they keep a distance on purpose.  <br />Bruno seems to be more like the average guy.  He was married, but more or less describes his ex-wife as a sex object.  He's gone through a midlife crisis.  He visits sex clubs with his current girlfriend, where they both have sex with friendly strangers.  Bruno had a hair transplant.  He likes to look sexy.<br />Michel is a molecular biologist.  He's more or less asexual. He thinks very mechanically about possibilities.    Nevertheless, he's very sad about many a thing.  Such is the way of life.  <br />At times, things go so poorly for these guys that the novel must be read as 1) extremely tragic 2) comic  or 3) absurd.<br />The Elementary Particles is a novel about how Bruno and Michel live, and cope, or don't cope.  A theme here seems to be that they are unable to be happy, because in this world, with society as it is, love is not possible, only sex.  And sex goes to the beautiful, the rich, the powerful, etc.  It seems that Houellebecq says that the sexual revolution is responsible, and we have breakdown of the family, an oversexed, crude society, and many unhappy people because we can't get what we want, not sex (most of us, anyway) and surely not love. <br />Of course anytime you blame ANYTHING of society's ills on the sexual revolution, you're bound to upset somebody.<br />Houellebecq's prose is crisp and clear, and with the novel so steeped in philosophy, there are bound to be echoes of Camus, especially with a French author.  But I think The Elementary Particles stands rather well on its own.   The philosophy isn't presented alongside the plot as an afterthought; the book really works as a whole, a well-told story encompassing and promoting certain themes which are laid bare throughout, without the book becoming boring or silly.  <br />Houllebecq is capable of writing (what I think are) very beautiful passages, will you take a look at this one: \\"At night Michel dreamed of abstract snow-covered spaces- his body, bandaged from head to foot, drifting beneath lowering skies between steel mills.\\"  And at times, perhaps nobody else agrees with me on this one, Les Particules Elementaries is FUNNY.  Laugh out loud funny I think it is, and a hoot.  Bruno visits a hippie camp where various actitivies and classes go on.  Yoga, self-realization, and whatnot.  We should think he's there just to find a woman with whom he can have sex.  The author's descriptions of Bruno's attempts to converse with women are masterful.  Bruno is pathetic and common, and his attempts will mean a great deal to any man who tries without success to talk to women.  Descriptions of the instructors and the other participants, through Bruno's eyes, made me laugh so hard I cried.<br />Readers repulsed by the themes in The Elementary Particles have every right to criticize Houellebecq on historical/cultural and philosophical grounds.  I'm not qualified to make such criticisms.<br />I think he's written a very good novel, though.  M is certainly no Camus, but perhaps he is the next best thing from the 1990s...	2001-06-01

You may remember Waber from Lyle, Lyle Crocodile or Nobody's Perfick.  <br />Written in rhyming verse, a bit of the text goes like this:<br />The quiet man's quiet wife<br />padded about in slippers.<br />She never made the faintest sound<br />not even while zipping zippers.<br />The quiet of this couple's life (they live in a country house, with a cat and a bird; the bird is named Will and likes to say 'Hush! Be still!\\") is broken by the arrival of a city mouse who falls asleep in their pantry, and awakens the house with a snoring that trembles the light fixtures and bangs the shutters.  <br />The pictures are very much the same as Waber's general sloppy style, but are humorous and kids will get a kick out of them.  The text is easy to follow but sometimes uses words that most kids won't know (tureen, for example).  <br />There are sometimes 5 or 6 panels on a page, like a comic strip.  This makes the book inconvenient or perhaps impossible for storytime situations.  Kids have to be close up to see The Mouse That Roared.  I couldn't see myself reading this book to a group of 4 or more children; they would have a hard time seeing the illustrations.<br />Children age 4 and 5 love this book, but my two year old son finds the book hard to follow.  I think the cluttered sloppy illustration style is the reason.  The text is basically simple, and rhyming,with a few difficult words.  <br />This isn't a classic like Lyle, but it's a decent picture book, and funny in places...	2001-06-01

The climbing and tumbling and reaching are all coming, as soon as your little one gets ahold of a copy of _The Bear Went Over the Mountain_.<br />ken32	2001-05-31
US	50951948	RMDTSEJXVCGYW	0689821034	611950230	Messenger, Messenger	Books	5	7	7	N	N	gotta go!	Robert Burleigh's _Messenger, Messenger_ is an exciting portrait of a bicycle messenger in a big city.  <br />In rhyming poetry, we meet Calvin Curbhopper, a young African-American bicycle messenger, as he moves around a big city making deliveries.  He's constantly on the move.  It's an exciting look at the bicycle messenger's life!<br />In our glimpse of Calvin's apartment, I was pleasantly surprised to see that his mattress is on the floor, and his place looks sparsely furnished and more than a little sloppy.  He's got a bookshelf full of books, an alarm clock, some music, and not a lot more.<br />Calvin works hard and enjoys himself, yet he doesn't have a lot of stuff!  So few children's books even present a glimpse inside the homes of single adults.  It's a minor point, but it's nice to get a look into Calvin's pad, especially because it isn't the 3 bedroom family suburban spread I'm accustomed to seeing in picture books.  <br />The lines in _Messenger, Messenger_ are poetic, and move along with a nice rhythm.  It's easy to feel the rhythm of the cyclist as he moves through traffic.<br />My two year old son loves this book.  He likes the rhythm of the story, and now I think, (gasp) that he might want to be a bike messenger when he grows up.  So much for engineering and medicine, I guess.<br />There aren't many picture books which portray the life and lifestyle of the bicycle messenger.  My son and I both like this one.<br />You should take a look at _Messenger, Messenger_. <br />ken32	2001-05-25

Baby Bear realizes he has forgotten something, so Baby Bear, Mama Bear, and Papa Bear venture back inside.<br />But the house is empty!  Father bear then says, &quot;But what about the memories?&quot;  Papa then carries baby bear around the house, and they say goodbye to each room, to the walls and ceilings, and in the back yard they say goodbye to the fence, and other objects.<br />After they leave the house and lock the front door, they get back in the moving van and drive away.  Baby bear exclaims that he realizes he forgot to say 'goodbye.'<br />It's a touching book, and it's easy to animate your voice a little bit to make the book funny and playful.<br />I know you're thinking there's not much to the plot, but my 2 year old son (he was 20 months when we first started reading this book) just LOVES it.  When I tell it, I give papa bear's voice a really rough edge, a deep sound, and a New York accent.  My son now joins in with me when I bust out with &quot;What about the memories&quot; like an actor in a gangster film.  He roars with laughter.  And when we're done reading the book, he usually wants me to read it one more time.<br />I heartily recommend _Goodbye House_ to any families with toddlers, 18 months to 3 years.  I also recommend it to any families with children aged 18 months to 5 years who are moving to a new house.<br />The paperback version is SO inexpensive.  For a few dollars more you can add this to your amazon book order.  You won't be disappointed.<br />ken32.	2001-05-25
US	50951948	R8XSN1NV9JUFP	0898750296	628201459	Rudin	Books	4	5	7	N	N	non-essential Turgenev	_Rudin_ is a good novel by Ivan Turgenev, but altogether non-essential, unless you want to read all of his works.<br />The character Rudin is a fortunate young man in 1860s Russia, a man around thirty years of age, in the prime of his life.  He is very much a superfluous man, like the man Turgenev wrote of in his shorter story &quot;A Superfluous Man.&quot;  He is all talk and no action.  He has high-minded ideals but can not transfer them into deeds.<br />I suppose Turgenev saw many young Russian men of his generation who served as the basis for Rudin, the character.  Natalya, Rudin's love interest, at least has the fortitude to translate her ideals into actions, but she is offered fewer possibilities by Russian society.  She comes off more sympathetically than the title character, but she is female, and therefore a minor character in a Turgenev work.  I found her more interesting, and similar to the female main character in _Oblomov_ by Goncharov.<br />The political edge on this novel is not nearly so sharp as that on _Fathers and Sons_.  Mostly this seems a personal and emotional novel, rather than a political novel.  A student wanting a general grounding in the major novels of Russian Literature can probably skip _Rudin_.  On the other hand, if you read _Fathers and Sons_ and found that book very rewarding, you may want to take a peek at _Rudin_, to see what another (earlier) novel by Turgenev is like.<br />ken32	2001-05-23

This is the first book I read by William Gibson, and to date it's my favorite.  <br />Gibson's strength is not the spinning of huge tales with hundreds of characters.  His strong suit is atmosphere.  These stories all have strong settings.  His language is poetic as he describes his near-future milieus, and his prose has a beat like a pulse as he makes you feel for his characters,  In all these stories, I felt like he had plopped me down right amongst the characters.  His feel for words, dialogue, and setting are so strong.  Everything he writes in these stories seems to ring true, as if he's describing a world that he himself created long ago.<br />&quot;Red Star Winter Orbit&quot; is a fascinating story, and &quot;Dogfight&quot; was perhaps my favorite.  There's a quality to his stories that I can't pinpoint well-- they all seem to flesh out what it means to be human in an age of rapidly advancing technology.  The technology is exciting, but scary at the same time.  I feel for these characters, because they have adapted to this harsh way of life, but at great cost.  <br />Gibson imagines a future that is either not far off, or here with us today, and these stories really set the tone for the novels to come later.  <br />If you're a fan of his novels like _Neuromancer_ or _All Tomorrow's Parties_, you owe it to yourself to try this group of short stories.  Cyperpunk had a sharper edge back when Gibson wrote these, and there's not a bad short story in this collection called _Burning Chrome_.<br />ken32	2001-05-22

They are tiny compared to the table, the cat, and everything else in their home.  <br />The two girls are shown standing in the dirt beside a potted plant, and we read that they are &quot;in a jungle.&quot;  The photographs are crisp and clear and lifelike. <br />The girls imagine themselves on a grand adventure, but somehow these nice photos and clever settings don't add up to much of a story.  <br />The neat feature of this story is this: the exotic elements of the girls' adventure are actually the regular, everyday objects in their house-- the cat, the houseplant, a toy airplane, etc.  It's a nice idea, and the photographs are beautiful.  <br />However, there are just about a million picture books for children out there with good stories, and this isn't one of them.<br />ken32	2001-05-22

He is a former schoolteacher who has been dismissed for having a relationship with a student, or making advances to a student.  Ginpei is truly pathetic; he is more or less an ordinary guy, but he truly cannot help himself.  He follows around women all the time.  He is truly seeking some kind of affection from women, and needs a boost to his confidence.  He thinks he is ugly, and he had feet which look like the feet of a monkey.<br />The story itself is not exciting or extraordinary, but Yasunari probes the soul of Ginpei to provide a very interesting character study.  Also the author does a very fine job of describing nature, whether it be lakes, trees, streams, etc.<br />Perhaps this is not the masterpiece by Yasunari.  I suppose that title falls to one of the other novels.  But _The Lake_ is a good solid novel (although it is short on plot) and not a bad introduction to the author.<br />ken32	2001-05-22

The illustrations are truly special.  David Diaz' illustrations show boxy figures, a mixture of soft and bright colors, and some of the most hilarious faces I've ever seen in a picture book.<br />The streets, the trees, the people-- everything Diaz draws has a special look that you won't mistake for any one else's illustrations.<br />The text bounces along with a nice rhythm.  Even if you are rhythm-inhibited, it's easy to find the rhythm in this book.  <br />The text of the book resembles the speech of children, rather than the bookish speech that you sometimes see in juvenile books.  Here's a sample:<br />&quot;Hey, Miss Minnie,<br />can you come outside?<br />I got a new car.<br />Let's go for a ride.<br />We can put the top down.<br />We can blow the horn loud.<br />We can show the gold rims.<br />We can captivate the crowd.&quot;<br />Captivate?  Not many children would use the rest of this speech and the word &quot;captivate.&quot;  The incongruity of the speech (there are more examples, and you don't have to look for them) is the only thing that mars this otherwise wonderful book.    <br />The illustrations are inventive and distinctive, and the text has a wonderful, animated rhythm.  It should be a book that children ask for over and over again.<br />ken32	2001-05-22

The pictures are a bit old fashioned, but it is well thought out and should appeal to children for several years, as the pages with higher numbers are more cluttered and therefore more difficult.

I was somewhat skeptical coming to the reading of _Underground_ that perhaps HM was in out of his depth with this book.  He's not an oral historian, he's a novelist.  I happen to think he's a great novelist, but still _Underground_ is not the kind of book which has helped to build his reputation.<br />The first portion of the book is made up of short (usually 3 pages) recollections of survivors of the Sarin attack on the Tokyo subway.  The voices are at first boring and hohum, just everyday joes and janes telling us things like why they missed their ordinary train, or what kind of job they do, or used to do.  The testimony of how the sarin caused them to lose their breath, their vision to dim, and them to fall down on the pavement is harrowing.  Still, all this testimony starts to get boring after about reading 10 accounts, I found.  <br />After reading about 100 pages, though, the voices take on a resonance that is incredibly powerful.   Such an attack, releasing packets of poison gas on a subway crowded with thousands of morning commuters, trapped underground-- it's remarkable!  it's possibly the most heinous act of terrorism ever!  I read these accounts again and again, and I would have read twice as many, had they been included in the text.<br />The second part of the book includes a short essay by Haruki Murakami, explaining where the gas attack fit in for him.  Then there are interviews with Aum Shinrikyo members who either participated in the attack or were members of the cult/organization who had no knowledge of the production of the chemicals or their use.  <br />Personally, when I first read about this attack in 1995, I had no idea that many of the Aum members were sequestered away from the main group, living in isolated mountain towns, performing their duties and living their lives as ascetics.  These individuals apparently had no idea that their colleagues had performed such a treacherous act.  <br />The second half of the book is just as interesting as the first, but very different.  Haruki's questions are included in the text, and it appears in interview format.  (some of them former) Aum group members explain what caused them to become interested in Aum, how they joined, what they did for a living, and how, if at all, they participated in the attack.  Some also engage Haruki in philosophical talk.<br />All in all, i would recommend reading this book if you are a fan of the novels of Haruki Murakami.  I would also recommend this book to any student of modern Japan.  <br />If you are interested in the psychology of cults and religions which ask their believers to renounce society and material things, this could be a very interesting book as well.  <br />If it weren't for Haruki's name on this book, I never would have read it.  That's a shame, because I was fascinated in the subject matter moreso than the perspective of the author.  I surely wish I could find more books like _Underground_, if even they exist.	2001-05-20

Lynn Stone's book _Hong Kong_ is a very short book on the subject, probably best used by children 7-10 years old who have a school assignment which requires a basic resource.<br />This book is not a travel guide, and it is not written for an adult audience.<br />The book is only 24 pages in length, and half the pages are pictures.  The photos are truly impressive (Courtesy of the Hong Kong Tourist Association).  I didn't expect photos half this nice in such a small book.  <br />The information here is bare bones.  The reader will learn only the most basic facts about Hong Kong, nothing more. _Hong Kong_ looks like a standard report-source book for juveniles, but it's just too short to be of a great deal of help.  I expect most of this information, and much more, will be in the entry for Hong Kong in any general encyclopedia.  <br />If you do some more extensive searching, you can probably find this much information on Hong Kong in an encyclopedia, and there are other juvenile books on the subject with more detailed information.<br />ken32	2001-05-17

Still, this is not strange.  <br />But later, as the friends include a group of chickens, a group of crows, a coyote, and Beethoven, the book gets funnier and funnier.<br />Young children realize that cows, chickens, and Beethoven don't belong in the house, and realize just how strange and genuinely funny Mr. and Mrs. Submarine are.

Mr. Plumbean lives on a street called Neat St. All the houses are neat, and they are all very similar. One day a bird drops a big spot of orange paint on his house. The neighbors want him to repaint his house, to make the house look neat again. He repaints his house, but with lots of odd and strange colors and designs! All the neighbors are outraged and appalled; they think he's flipped his wig! <br />I've read this book to kids, 3- to 5-year olds, and they think it's hilarious. I think most kids would love to strike out and look different, make unusual art, et cetera. The world of adults probably looks boring to lots of kids. But overly serious adults discourage kids from looking or acting too far from accepted norms. Mr. Plumbean, and his creator Mr. Pinkwater, show kids that it's okay for your house to look different, and for you to be different! <br />My only quibble with this book: after Plumbean changes the looks of his house, the neighbors complain for a while, then ALL the other neighbors change the looks of their houses as well, to look like their dreams, as did Mr. Plumbean. It's a bit of a stretch. Did they ALL want to change their houses? Isn't that a bit of conformity in itself? If at least one guy had left his house the way it was, and said &quot;my house always looked like my dreams,&quot; (surely, Plumbean and all of his newly enlightened neighbors would approve) it would have seemed more in keeping with the &quot;be yourself&quot; theme of the book. As it is, all the neighbors seem to be hopping on the bandwagon. <br />Out in the real world, not everyone wants to have a goofy looking house (or outfit, or car), regardless of what other people think. Anyway, that's my quibble. I give this book 4 stars. Little kids (and older kids, also, apparently) really love it! <br />RESOLVE TO BUY THIS HUMOROUS BOOK.<br />ken32	2001-05-13

He lives in a storage unit with a cult-hero rockstar named Vitaly Chernobyl.  He owns a futon, two awesome Japanese swords, and a laptop computer, where he stays &quot;jacked in&quot; to the &quot;Metaverse&quot; a lot of the time, where he is the world's greatest swordfighter.  <br />Hiro witnesses a crime while interacting with others in the Metaverse.  One of his friends is deliberately exposed to a dangerous block of text, which fries his brain (in the real world), and renders him a vegetable.  Hiro and his friend Y.T. (15-year old skateboarding female, and knee-slappingly funny smartaleck) set off to find out why, and save the world in the process.<br />From the getgo this is a funny book.  Sure, the vision of the near-future is dark, a little alarming, and at times depressing (there are NO general laws in _Snow Crash_, for example, and private corporations run everything, even the police, just as an example).  That's what cyberpunk is like.  But the HUMOR is one thing that sets Neal Stephenson aside.  Hiro Protagonist?  Come on, that's FUNNY, PEOPLE!  One reviewer called it an 'odd' name.  Yes, it's odd, and it's absurd, and it's funny!  Did this author mean it is an unusual choice for a character name?  I don't know.  I hope not.  It would be an odd choice for a  character's name in a Jane Austen novel, sure.  But this is cyberpunk, or something like it.   Among this genre's leading inspirations are the works of Thomas Pynchon, and &quot;Hiro Protagonist,&quot; asa character name, would fit in perfectly among his merry bands of misfits, especially in _V._ or _Gravity's Rainbow_.<br />Repeatedly reviewers are slamming Stephenson for his use of Sumerian myth, exploration of Sumerian culture, etc. in the book... calling it inaccurate, poorly connected to the rest of the story, and, (my personal least favorite), BORING.  I tell you, besides the great sense of humor, the Sumerian-myth link is what sets this novel heads above so much other cyberpunk.  I don't care if it's inaccurate (this is FICTION, see?).  Stephenson &quot;traces&quot; computer/textual viruses and biological viruses quite nicely back to Sumerian times, and he links them to one another, biological virus to digital/informational virus (a debt to another pre-cyberpunk luminary, William Burroughs, who said &quot;Word is Virus?&quot;)-- it's all very well connected to the metaverse/here-and-now portion of _Snow Crash_'s plot.<br />This is a funny, riproaring tale.  I raced through this nearly 500-page paperback in half the time I read most books of this length.  I enjoyed it beginning-to-end.  My only complaint with the book was that, at times, it too much resembled a Hollywood action movie, what with all sorts of incredible stunts being performed, by boat drivers, skateboarders, swordsmen, etc.  <br />I say, if you like William Gibson or Thomas Pynchon, or if any of this review makes _Snow Crash_ seem a bit appealing to you, give it a chance.  I enjoyed it 10 times as much as I thought I would.<br />ken32	2001-04-30

Peter and Willie are spotted by some rather dangerous looking &quot;older boys.&quot;  One of the older boys demands the goggles.  After some uncertain and rather scary moments, the boys and dog outwit the older boys and escape to the safety of Archie's front porch.<br />The story has dark, gritty illustrations.  I didn't live in an American ghetto in the 1960's, so I can only guess that Keats is accurately evoking the scene with his trademark colorful semi-abstract imagery.  He uses collages and all the devices from Whistle for Willie to create a book that, for all the simplicity, looks like a movie.  It reminds me of TV shows like Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.<br />The book might be a bit &quot;old&quot; for the 2-year olds, considering the implied threat of violence in the plot, but my son just loves it.  <br />If you're looking for another title by the author of Whistle for Willie, this is a good one!<br />...	2001-04-30

Many came to America during the California Gold Rush, but were unable to afford to return to China after the Gold Rush was over.  These men were also unable to afford to have their families sent over from China.  Later, Chinese immigrants did the majority of work on the western link of the first trans-America railroad, a section which ran from California to Utah.<br />The second half of the book tells the story of Japanese immigrants, who perhaps fared better than the Chinese immigrants of the earlier wave.  A gentleman's agreement between Theodore Roosevelt and the government of Japan allowed Japanese persons in America to bring over a greater number of family members, which actually led to quite a boom in Japanese immigration to America.  <br />There has been a great deal of discrimination against people of Asian origin throughout American history, and Gail Sakurai's book does a good job of telling this side of the story.  However, the story is not just a story of injustices and oppression.  Accomplishments such as the completion of the Sacramento-to-Utah railroad, and the career of George &quot;The Potato King&quot; Shima, who died in 1926 worth $15 million, are positive elements within the text.<br />Perhaps the title phrase &quot;Old West&quot; conjures up images of gunslinging and cattle rustling.  That's what I thought, when I picked the book up.  But the Old West of the Asian-American immigrant was all about working in the fields, driving the railroad spikes, and just trying to make a better life in America, while avoiding the suspicious and racist stare of the white people.  <br />I would say this book is written on a reading level that would be best for students aged 8-12.  However, this book is a worthwhile read for any student interested in the Asian-American experience.<br />ken32	2001-04-15

Also, Mel Ramos' &quot;Man of Steel,&quot; which shows Superman bursting through a metal wall, and Andy Warhol's &quot;Triple Elvis,&quot; which will appeal through a mixture of conveying the campy and the cool-- a triple frontal image of Elvis in full cowboy getup, pointing a six-shooter.  <br />Imagine.  If children got to look at this book, they might think that art is FUN!<br />There is a general introduction over the first few pages, followed by two page spreads on Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Allan D'Arcangelo, Tom Wesselmann, James Rosenquist, Richard Hamilton, Peter Blake, Patrick Caulfield, and David Hockney.  There are a few images, with accompanying text, on works by other artists, like Robert Indiana and Ed Ruscha.<br />I personally would have given Ruscha a 2-page spread like Warhol and those other guys got, but nobody asked me.<br />The accompanying text is well written and interesting, with insights and explanations that would work well for a 10-year old reader.  <br />I  would have loved to see a pull-out of James Rosenquist's F-111 here, but I suppose it really doesn't work with the picture-book 32 page format.  It's his most famous painting, or so I thought, but such a long image doesn't work well on this page shape.  <br />This book could serve as a good introduction to the Pop Art artists for an adult as well, but there are many other books that would do the same job better.  <br />The back of the book includes some helpful resources:  a glossary, a list of notable galleries and museums, a list of 3 websites (2 of the links even still work!), and a list of three other books to read.  (one on Warhol, one on Roy Lichtenstein, and one on modern art in general).  <br />I don't recall ever seeing a children's book just on Pop Art before.  This publication fills a great need.<br />It should be fun for any children who are interested in famous painters and paintings.  In my experience, children are DELIGHTED to find out that cartoon and advertisement images and styles can be appropriated into &quot;serious art&quot; or can be taken seriously by people who write about art and decide on what art goes into museums and galleries.<br />This should make an excellent purchase for home-schooling families studying 20th century art.  It also should be a smart purchase for middle school, high school, and public libraries.<br />Buy it for yourself!  It's a neat book.<br />ken32	2001-04-15

It's a overview of his career, with probably 40 or 50 plates. Almost all of the plates are black and white. <br />The accompanying text is well written and clear. In fact, the text is probably more worthwhile than are the images. If you have a chance to get a large coffee table book of Duchamp's art, do that. The images in this book are simply too small to be of much use. However, the explication of the artist's career is interesting and worth reading. <br />Duchamp was one of the most interesting and pivotal figures in early 20th century art. This book is a good introduction. This book is best supplemented by a coffee-table Duchamp book.  However, the analysis is astute and concise. It's not difficult to read, and it makes for a decent introduction to the artist.<br />ken32	2001-04-07

This novel sold a HUGE number of copies in Japan. I was wondering: I love those other novels by Murakami. Are they so demanding? Complicated? If Norwegian Wood is so much simpler than the other novels, will I even like Norwegian Wood?<br />The plot: It's the late 1960's. College student Toru falls in love with the girlfriend of his (dead) best friend. She eventually becomes ill (though not physically ill) and has to leave to live under special circumstances, far away from him. While she's gone, he meets Midori, a college student who obviously is interested in him. But he's holding out for his girlfriend Naoko. Never knowing if she will recover from her ailment and be able to rejoin him in society, he goes to classes, sells phonograph records at night, and spends some time with Midori. He visits Naoko a few times, gets to know her wacky roommate/friend/mentor Reiki, and eventually he has to decide between a life with Naoko (without Naoko?) or with Midori. Throw in a bizarre Geography-major roommate nicknamed &quot;Storm Trooper,&quot; a scene where Midori (badly) sings folk songs to our Toru while they watch a neighborhood fire from the balcony above her parents' bookshop, and assorted other hilarious/bizarre characters and passages, and you've got vintage Haruki Murakami.<br />My favorite scene is one in which Midori takes Toru to visit her ill father in the hospital. He's so ill he can barely eat or speak, but Toru convinces Midori to enjoy a respite, and take a walk by herself out to a park in town. Toru isleft alone with this bedridden stranger, in a situation that would seem forced, harsh, and impossible to enjoy, yet they make some very odd and touching inroads with each other. It's very unusual, and perfect in just the way that so many of Murakami's scenes seem to be.<br />The novel isn't as complex as Haruki's other work, and it's missing some of the magical realist / sci-fi / unexplainable elements that were so prevalent in Dance Dance Dance, Wild Sheep Chase, and Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. However, this novel is just as enjoyable, and just as worthwhile. This novel has a sustained emotional depth that other works by Murakami only achieve in passages. <br />If you're a fan of modern literature at all, do yourself a favor. Read Norwegian Wood, and read Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. <br />ken32	2001-04-05

The photography is amazing, and the mystery-style pattern of the book should be intriguing for youngsters also.  The anatomy information is accurate, and could be useful to an advanced middle school reader or a high school reader, although the photographs will gross a certain appeal, regardless of the readers' ages.

It may appeal to the high school student who has a hard time reading and motivating himself to read an extended narrative, however.  Apparently the author chose some players with diversity in mind, albeit not racial diversity.  Spud Webb rarely if ever dunked in an NBA game, but is included presumably because he is so short (5'7&quot;).  This should serve as an inspiration to average height and short readers.  It's a good thing the author did include some players who are still in the NBA (Scottie Pippen, Shawn Kemp).  <br />It's interesting to read about some players of yesteryear, such as Connie Hawkins and Darrell Griffith.  Unfortunately, the narrative fails to counter mention of Darryl Dawkins' leap from high school directly to the pros (calling him &quot;a most special pro-basketball pioneer&quot;) with any mention of his disappointing professional career.  Perhaps a few years of college ball would have helped Dawkins, but we don't read of that here.	2001-03-27

Indeed, the mix extends to ages.  One former gang member is only thirteen years old.  The testimonies are chilling, the thirteen year old &quot;Elena&quot; (pseudonym) tells us &quot;you can get guns given to you for free.  They're stolen-- they'll just give them to you.&quot;  The short narratives do not glamorize violence or &quot;the life,&quot; nor are the youngsters indulging in hagiography.  The testimonies are gritty, seem to be honest, and all the youngsters read as if they wanted out of life situations such as poverty, neglect, and violent homes very badly, thus gangs seemed a good alternative.<br />I'd say this is a good resource for someone doing a report on gangs, especially if the writer needs a resource with testimony from former gang members.<br />ken32	2001-03-27

His older brother is a football star and his parents' favorite; eventually Paul realizes his dream of playing soccer and uncovering the cause of his near-blindness.<br />Tangerine is an excellent book for teenage readers.  The narrative is written in Paul's voice, which should appeal to young readers.<br />Bloor brings a sensibility regarding race and ethnicity to the story that is rarely present in good books for teenagers.  He also brought a ready enough eye and pen to critique the newness and artificiality of suburbia, particularly Florida's suburbia.  From page 71-- &quot;It was strange to see an old packing plant, to see an old anything.  But it was also comforting that something around here has a history.  That something actually belongs here.&quot;  <br />I really enjoyed reading Tangerine.  It's nice to read a book written for teenage readers that doesn't talk down to them in any way.  Paul is a neat and well-drawn character.  His problems are problems that people can understand.<br />Tangerine is a great read.  I'm 33 years old, and I loved it.<br />ken32	2001-03-27

Langston Hughes was a successful writer with an entertaining and exciting career.  Osofsky doesn't skimp on the depressing details, including mention of Langston's thorny relationship with his father, rejections at soda counters and restaurants (due to his race), and several other disappointments, mostly economic. (&quot;To save money, he borrowed textbooks from the library instead of buying them, and washed his socks and handkerchiefs by hand.&quot;)  Still, this is an entertaining read and a good overall assessment of the author's career.  High school students who have been entertained or inspired by his poetry will find more inspiration here.  <br />This is a good biography, probably best for young readers, aged 10-18.

Julius Knipl:  Real Estate Photographer Stories is a collection of Ben Katchor's comics about about middle-class guys in New York City.  At first glance each comic (usually 4 or 8 panels) seems to have no point, and the tone tends to remind me of the Jim books (I Made Some Brownies, And They Were Pretty Good, etc.), but Katchor seems to have staked out some pretty bizarre literary territory with these little stories.<br />One of my favorites concerns a man who is nearly poked in the eye with an umbrella on a rainy day.  He's telling a companion his story, when a bystander overhears and tells him that many city residents are actually suffering from eye injuries on a day like this.  This eye-injury enthusiast takes our man to the hospital, to see him &quot;offer condolences to the families of the injured.&quot;  <br />Another story concerns a group of volunteers who man phone lines all night, just to take calls from concerned citizens who have heard fire engine or ambulance sirens.  Lots of the stories are about businessmen with bizarre, pathetic, or just loopy invention ideas:  a suitcase that turns into a wastebasket, a storefront which sells rock candy, but only wholesale...<br />The text is punctuated by hilarious proper names, such as:<br />Blood &amp; Sawdust Brand Cirkus Straws<br />The Ascending Colon, with Horace Bismuth and Vivian Scybala<br />Citric Acid Council<br />Viosh Shirue's Natural Rainwater Cistern<br />Katchor doesn't look down at his characters or approach them with anything similar to condescension.  If I am motivated to feel anything at all after reading this, it's a bit more humility and compassion for my fellow man.    At times these little stories are laugh-aloud funny, but mostly they just bring a smile and a little chuckle.<br />I am glad I ran across this book.<br />ken32<br />And yes, these pieces were not created to be consumed en masse.  If you find a few amusing or worthwhile, but they get tiresome after a bit, just put the book down,and read a few of them each day, as you would if your daily newspaper carried them.	2001-03-27

It then takes off on a hike around town, dressed in clothing, after having grown to the size of a man! &quot;The Overcoat&quot; is probably the best known short story in Russian Literature, at least to American readers. Dostoevsky said that they all (later Russian writers) came from underneath Gogol's overcoat. &quot;The Overcoat&quot; is not as wacky as &quot;The Nose,&quot; but there is a subtle undercurrent of oddness which is hard to pinpoint. It's been anthologized as a fantasy story, but it surely has little in common with your wizards-and-dragons type of fantasy. &quot;The Overcoat&quot; inhabits a middle ground between Russian realist literature and fantastic literature, without the blatantly absurd elements of &quot;The Nose.&quot; A government clerk works and works to get an overcoat, to which he clings dearly, only to have it stolen from him. The realistic stories by Gogol are not drably realistic like much of Russian Literature, but are infused with an irony that underlies the text, twisting it ever so slightly. Often the reader doesn't know when Gogol is being serious and when he's taking a slightly wry angle on his own characters.  These stories are very satisfying, and probably a good place to start, rather than reading one of Gogol's novels or his play _The Inspector General_. ken32	2001-03-19

Water is scarce on mars, and what few settlements exist are very close to one of the few canals.  Plumbers, waterworkers, and repairmen are very valuable and in demand, since getting replacement equipment from Earth is very expensive.  <br />Jack Bohlen is a repairman, and a &quot;recovered&quot; schizophrenic.  Jack is contacted by Arnie Kott, a businessman who is involved in land speculation.  He seems to believe that a schizophrenic boy can somehow see into the future  (slip in and out of TIME) on Mars, and Jack can help Arnie communicate with the boy, by building a machine that will translate the boy's gibberish speech into something Arnie can understand.    Arnie would like to make a killing in land speculation, with Jack's help.<br />Add to this:  there is an aboriginal race of humans on Mars called the Bleekmen, who resemble Africans of very materially primitive societies.  They wander the vast deserts of Mars, impoverished and disenfranchised, but hold the mystical keys to this time travel.<br />It's a strange and beautiful novel.  Action Sci-Fi fans beware.  This novel takes a long time to get going.  The first 80 or 100 pages are taken up with that stuffy writing goal called &quot;character development,&quot; and you won't get many shoot-em-up scenes with spaceships etc.  This novel is pretty typical of Philip K. Dick in that it's more cerebral than it is visceral.  I found the first half of the novel fascinating but slow going, myself.  After I was halfway through, I spent all of my spare time reading it until I was done.<br />If you like Philip K. Dick, you ought to read Martian Time-Slip.	2001-03-19

They vary in length, from a few pages to 30+ pages, but they all bear the Murakamiesque stamps of eerieness, humor, and compassion.  <br />In the title story, an elephant vanishes from a public enclosure, as does his keeper.  It seems like a simple mistake; couldn't his keeper have just stolen him, and left town?  Couldn't the elephant have run away, and the keeper is just searching for him?  (these occur to the reader, but they're not offered by the narrator or a character...) But towards the end of the story, our narrator offers us a few bizarre details.  Yes, the elephant vanished all right.  And he knows it vanished.  Murakami's description of this is amazing.<br />Other stories involve a late night robbery of a fast food restaurant (of food, not money), a man on the last day of his lawn-mowing job, and a woman who witnesses a small green monster emerge from the soil of her front yard.  <br />One of my favorites involves a woman who has gone weeks without sleep. She reads Anna Karenina at night.  During the days, she lives as she always did, and her husband and son are oblivious to her insomnia.  A very strange fate befalls her.  <br />If you've read some of Murakami's novels, but you haven't read THE ELEPANT VANISHES, you owe it to yourself to give this book a chance.  The stories are just great.  If you haven't yet read Haruki Murakami, this collection is actually a pretty good place to start.  <br />ken32	2001-03-19

Entries for each animal are detailed enough, but don't seem to go on so long that a person would lose interest.  <br />One more gripe:  pictures of the animals feet, so that pawprints could be identified easily, would have been a welcome inclusion here.  The Simon and Schuster's Guide To Mammals, by Boitani, is an inexpensive book that includes this feature.  It might be a helpful second book to get on the topic.<br />It's an exciting book for young naturalists, too, who will likely get stirred up just by seeing some of the photos (star-nosed mole, northern flying squirrel, big brown bat, etc.).<br />Essays on conservation, the region, and tips on observation precede the main body of the book.

In fact, it's almost a pamphlet-sized book, so you can throw it in your glove compartment and bring it along for the ride.<br />Each of the North Carolina lighthouses gets about a one- or two-page treatment.  The information is general, and the writing is clear.  It's easy to understand.  I think a 10 or 12 year old child could surely absorb the information in the book.<br />However, there are no photos in the book.  The maps appear to be hand-drawn; the pictures of the lighthouses are illustrations also.  This gives the book a homey, old-fashioned feel.  <br />If you have a relative or friend who is planning a trip to the coast, or someone who has an interest in the N.C. lighthouses, this would make an appropriate and inexpensive little present.  It's an affordable alternative to more expensive coffee table books on the subject.<br />ken32	2001-03-15

I'm sure this family is just a family of wonderful hearty folk, but this is not your average family in Iceland.  <br />Iceland is very much a modern, materialistic nation.

The general humdrum drama of their lives goes on as they get into fights, have disagreements, counsel one another over their losses, and so on.  <br />Luka, an idealistic spiritual sort, finds his way into the group, and starts to spread his message of hope and positive thinking.  This spurs the plot along a bit, because many in the group are hard-bitten realists who have no truck with faith or hope.<br />This is a fine play by Maxim Gorky.  Gorky doesn't have the number of famous plays that someone like Henrik Ibsen or George Bernard Shaw does.  In fact, he might be better known for his memoir of his childhood than for this play.<br />Nevertheless, The Lower Depths is a great play.  The gritty element described in the play makes it seem much more like  a modern play than the 1902 publication date would indicate.  The realistic dialogue and streetwise characters make it hard to put down.<br />ken32	2001-02-16

That allowed the author to summon all her resources to fight the disease, and find a healthier and happier life.<br />I don't have lupus, but someone close to me does.  This book I found to be immensely helpful.  The book is not just about lupus, but it's about a couple coming to terms with a disease, and two individuals coming to terms with THEIR disease in different ways.  <br />I read this book because I wanted to better understand what my friend is going through with lupus.  If you have a friend with lupus, I recommend this book to you.  <br />Lupus can be so confusing to outsiders-- I'm sure many a romantic relationship and many a friendship have been strained or ended because non-sufferers don't understand the nature of the disease. <br />If you have a friend with lupus, do yourself a favor and read this book.<br />ken32	2001-02-15

There are images of a little girl and her baby sibling.  She is hiding, throwing, sliding, running, and doing other fun things that will appeal to most toddlers.<br />The text, with lines like &quot;see how I can throw!&quot; and &quot;or do balancing tricks, with one foot in the air!&quot; doesn't follow a predictable, repeating pattern.  Nevertheless, when I said one line of the text to my son (with the book nowhere in sight), he ran into his room and retrieved this book!<br />This is a memorable book that has made an impression on my son.

His subjects are everyday people:  menial laborers, folks on the dole, people with relationships good and bad, friends faithful and not-so-faithful.  <br />His language is sometimes harsh, but it never seems false.  These characters seem to be real as if they could step right off the page into your hands.  <br />Sometimes the scottish dialect is difficult for me to comprehend, but that is more than offset by the realism (equally as realistic, I think, as good hardboiled crime fiction, though that seems like an odd comparison, to me) and by the humour of the stories.  <br />These stories are hilarious.  Often the figures are lonely, pathetic, or sorrowful, failures in the eyes of many, but Kelman never denigrates or looks down upon his characters.  He renders them with the greatest humanity and conveys them to the reader with much respect.<br />Kelman's stories always make me laugh, and make me feel, and this collection surely has done both, a couple of times over.	2001-02-09

Harold Pinter's _The Birthday Party_:<br />A young man lives with his mother at a run-down boarding house near the beach.  Two visitors come and shake things up.  They don't do anything wild or unusual, but they question and intimidate the young man, until the reader becomes unsure what sinister plans the two men have in mind.<br />Pinter's strength lies in his dialogue, which is thoroughly believable and memorable.  Not for a moment does the reader doubt that these scenes could happen (and may HAVE happened) in real life.  <br />As this reader read the play, the tension built and built, as I became more and more sympathetic to the young man, awaiting to learn his fate, as his own will seemingly deteriorated.<br />I would agree that this play is a funny read, but it's certainly very unsettling as well.  <br />If you haven't read anything by Harold Pinter, or are curious because you've read his other plays, _The Birthday Party_ is worth checking out.<br />ken32	2001-02-07

When I first heard Masuji Ibuse's name, it was in association with his best known work, _Black Rain_, regarding the Hiroshima bombing and aftermath.<br />This _Salamander and other Stories_ is a collection of short stories, and it is well worthwhile.  The stories here are about ordinary people doing everyday things; Ibuse's craftsman's touch and his personal insight into everyday behaviours are what make this collection so special.<br />One story concerns a rural elderly man's obsession with his prize-winning bulls, and what happens when they disappear. Another regards a bizarre military tragedy, and the title story is about a salamander who becomes too large to leave his cave. <br />All the stories are significantly different and special to make them memorable to me; the place names and character names are Japanese, but the style itself doesn't have \\"Japanese\\" stamped all over it. The stories strike a universal chord. <br />Anyone who loves short stories, be they contemporary Japanese, contemporary American, or by one of Europe's masters of Modernism (think Joyce's _Dubliners_, the stories of Kafka, or the stories of Thomas Mann), should at least give Ibuse's _Salamander and other Stories_ a try.

The title refers to a movie which is debuting soon in the area theatres, to a lot of street-level buzz.<br />The characters aren't glamorous, but they're really memorable.  Description is one of the author's strong suits, but that doesn't get in the way of an exciting, riveting plot.<br />Pelecanos' books are my favorites among crime and mystery authors working today; he really captures the sense of Washington D.C. (this book is set during the 1970's), and the characters are true to form.  <br />If you like your fiction hard-boiled, give Pelecanos a try.  I wouldn't start with this one.  Start with A FIRING OFFENSE.  <br />If you've read some of the earlier ones, like Nick's Trip or A Firing Offense, try the Suckerman.<br />ken32	2000-10-24

Sometimes there is just one sentence per page.  Definitions are given as simple sentences, immediately following their use on the same page.   (i.e. &quot;Predators are animals that hunt and eat other animals.&quot;)<br />A little confusing is the map given near the end, with USA states unlabelled, which challenges the reader with the question &quot;Do octopuses live near you?&quot;  While an older child may be able to identify his state or province on such a map, such a child would probably be reading a more advanced book on the octopus.<br />Overall, this is a good introductory text for VERY young readers, with extraordinary photographs.<br />ken32	2000-10-23

He took up painting in his later years, declared the written word an obsolete medium (still, books were published under his name), and produced many paintings, which were shown in numerous galleries.  <br />The second half of the book concerns Burroughs and his views on guns, in part.  It has the text of a conversation which was recorded during a shooting party attended by Burroughs and a few friends.  It has a few witty remarks by Burroughs, but not much else.<br />It's hard to imagine who the intended audience was for this book, unless it was Burroughs completists only.<br />Really, _Painting And Guns_ is only for those who have read Burroughs' book of essays, _The Adding Machine_, and also all of his novels.<br />For completists only.<br />ken32	2000-10-23

It is probably best suited to readers age 6-8.  For a child who has read material about salamanders before, particularly a complete book, this book will break no new ground.  For such children, a more in-depth study would be a better choice.  <br />The photographs are definitely the highlight of this book.  The book is picture-book sized, and a full color photograph faces each page of text.  The photographs are dazzling, with some salamanders shown well larger than actual size.<br />Maruska's book is not particularly texty, though.  Most of the pages only include 3 or 4 sentences.  It won't overwhelm the younger readers, but it's definitely not enough for the better or older readers.  <br />Often the photographs don't seem to be well suited to the text.  Example, from pages 24,25:  the photograph is of a Tiger salamander preying upon another salamander.  Text on the opposite page starts off &quot;Salamanders are predators, which means they hunt other animals for their dinner...&quot;.  A photograph of a salamander eating a NON-SALAMANDER ANIMAL would accompany this text nicely, but a young reader will see this photo and likely come away confused about the term &quot;predator.&quot;  The photograph doesn't reinforce the definition as well as a different photograph would.<br />In any case, the photos are nice, and most of the text is not too terribly confusing.<br />We've all seen better, and we've all seen worse.  <br />A text for young naturalists who haven't read on salamanders before.	2000-10-09

The protagonist is mistakenly turned into a donkey.  Actually, the mind of a man is in the body of a donkey.  While he has the body of a donkey, he has retained the mind of a human being.  He overhears conversations and witnesses deeds that a human stranger would not be allowed to witness.  It's a brutal, funny, and memorable tale, showing human nature very honestly, warts and all.<br />_The Golden Ass_ was written in Latin, and it may be the only surviving Latin novel of the period.  The structure is episodic, as the protagonist gets into one predicament after another (as a donkey), much like Gulliver in Gulliver's Travels, or Odysseus in The Odyssey.  I think it clearly influenced early successful novels such as Gulliver's Travels and Don Quixote.<br />The novel is bawdier than other works which survive from its day.  The bawdy, ribald humor sets _The Golden Ass_ apart from other tales, and its place in the History of Literature makes it a classic.	2000-10-08

However, because difficult terms (i.e. radula, cirri, chromatophores) are defined in the text, I think that even younger readers won't have much trouble with this book.  <br />Advanced science readers will be fascinated with the more in-depth facts and description of the octopus' life cycle and other details.  <br />The photography in this book is simply marvelous.  No one will complain about these images; they accompany the text appropriately, and the book is worth looking through a second time just to gawk at the photos.  <br />The writing is awkward at times, but that can't take much away from this book, when the text content and photography are SO strong.  This would be an excellent book for a young octopus lover!<br />ken32	2000-10-08

Her book is a study of one person's solitude; as such, it works well as a personal &quot;coming of age&quot; story.  That may strike you as odd, because Grumbach is probably in her 50's or 60's, but it's a personal journey story, a tale of one person's finding herself, of imposing a solitary life upon herself.  <br />It's about solitude, and adjusting yourself from a more frenetic way of life to a simpler way of life, socially.<br />I generally don't read this sort of thing at all, but I loved this book.	2000-10-02

Lauber's _An Octopus is Amazing_ is a decent introductory book on the topic, probably best suited to children aged 4-8.  There are no photographs.  The book is illustrated on each page with color drawings.  The drawing on the book cover is indicative of the quality of the drawings throughout.  It's a bit cartoonish.  <br />There is little organization to the subject matter.  Instead, the author just presents one (probably &quot;amazing&quot;) fact after another, such as: octopuses change color, octopuses can lay 200,000 eggs, etc. <br />I think most  children, if given the opportunity to pick another  book on the subject, might not choose this one, simply because there are no color photographs.   Still, it's a decent guide to the subject for young readers and the even younger read-to children.  The amazing facts in this book just might prompt them to seek out other octopus books.  That wouldn't be so very amazing.	2000-09-29

Parts of a body are found on farms which are leased as hunting lands by a local hunting club.  <br />It's not long before Balzic has figured out the identity of the victim, but pinning the murder on the killer is another matter.  Again, sharp attention to detail and a good appreciation for local color make Constantine's writing so special.  He really gets the small town cop character right.  Or, at least, I think he does.  It sure has the ring of truth.  <br />Characters such as the defense attorney Mo Valcanas reappear in this book.  They're certainly welcome; Balzic isn't the only interesting character from the first novel.  I'm hoping for a reappearance of the priest character from the railway murders novel.   The priest was my favorite character, aside from Mario, in the debut.  I don't recall the priest having any role in this book.<br />The title seems unrelated to the story, until late in the novel, when it's presented by Balzic himself in a clever turn of the plot.<br />All in all, this is a good small-town police-chief murder mystery.	2000-09-29

He's an oddball in that he doesn't even carry a gun, usually.  When a senseless  murder occurs at the railroad station, and there are no witnesses, Mario  must rely on his wits and knowledge of psychology to direct him to the  likely killer.<br />Constantine writes very realistic fiction.  This is not a  glamorous or exciting detective novel, compared to most detective novels.   The small-town setting makes it different from most police procedurals,  also.  All the dialogue seems very true-to-life, and the characters are  drawn by someone who knows people.<br />The story drew me in further and  further as I read.
