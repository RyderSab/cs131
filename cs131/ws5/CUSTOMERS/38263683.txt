An edge-of-the-seat read which I find unusual in fantasy.    <br />  <br />If there were such a genre, I'd call these fantasy mysteries because they have all the requirements to make a suspenseful story where good is stalked by evil. In Storm Watcher, such is the case, but it is Hanson who is set against Mari because she has seen him kill her friend, Theo, the green witch and another Lightbringer. <br />  <br />Though Hanson denies it could happen Mari doesn't appear to believe him and is torn between a growing feeling for him and her deep friendship for Theo.  All Hanson knows for certain is that the dark is stalking Mari and Theo too.  Can the two watchers keep them alive? How can he when Mari keeps disappearing on him? <br />  <br />A finely tuned tension runs through this story, vibrating to the personalities  of the main characters as they hold our attention from beginning to end. You'll feel the power that thrums along the bonds connecting one to the other and hold your breath each time danger threatens.   <br />  <br />Highly recommended as a fun read, beginning to end. You'll be waiting for the next book involving these characters.  Will Elise find her watcher, a man she won't be able to scorch? She isn't the fire witch for nothing and smoke tendrils follow her passage. Very enjoyable stories by the very talented Lilith Saintcrow. <br />	2005-07-06

Monsieur Cassel is lured into at trap and told not to question one particular witness too deeply and to put his efforts into other cases. <br />  <br />While very human and able to fear his captors, once they leave him and he returns to his office, Stanislas determines to carry the case through to a logical conclusion and catch the killer. By telling him not to ask too many questions of Monsieur Boucher, an old man who had been a collaborator with the Nazis during their occupation of Paris, the effect is exactly the opposite of what the threat meant to have. <br />  <br />Stanislas begins to investigate in earnest and uncovers many old secrets and bring him face to face with his own family history.  The question of whether Monsieur Pincus was killed because of an old secret or did it have something to do with new unrest being fueled by an influx of foreigners is one that Stanslas must answer and his search brings him into contact with a wide range of well drawn characters whose lives you will believe will resume once the case is solved. <br />  <br />The dark mood created by talented Steve Haberman fits perfectly the mood of a nation seeking a sense of security and stability while manipulative power grabbers use the threat of immigrants to urge people to follow them.

Just be careful whose business you are poking into or you could wind up like Tony Almington.  Dead.  Liz Moretti had an argument with her business partner, Tony, and in her anger made an idle threat.

But this was the last time he'd ever do it. When Tony called Liz in the middle of the night, she started off to meet him, but got a flat tire. An insistent policeman stopped to help change the tire and, instead, arrested Liz. Tony's body was in the boot of her car. Not enough evidence to hold her, Liz was freed.

August Summers joins forces with police detective Bobby Beckett, the officer in charge of the investigation of the strange killings, after they find they have more than one thing in common. August might become the killer's next victim and Bobby is working to prevent just that.

This tale sparks with mystery and light horror, a great mix for a read on one of those stormy nights when you are alone in a creaky house and the lights flicker as thunder sounds close by. If you are like me, you might end up reading this tale, one you can't put down, in a closet with a flashlight--if the conditions are right. However, if you are easily spooked, this is daylight reading. But either time you choose to read Too Many Secrets, you won't be able to stop until that last page is turned. A tale with touches of Psycho (the original, of course), The Haunting, and others that carry this same dark and daunting atmosphere. A great house with a lovely view is a scene of a disappearance and several horrendous murders. Blood flows at a Halloween party as easily as does the wine, a party that culminates in three gory deaths. Who could hate these people who were caught in a lover's triangle so much? This is a question you'll be asking as you read. This is edge-of-the-chair reading as other events are also played out in this same setting. How could such evil exist and not be known? A great read with a cast of characters you'll enjoy meeting. They seem like ordinary, harmless folks, but the little voice in the back of your mind will keep warning you to beware of trusting their innocence. You'll be trying to pin the murders on one, then another. Highly recommended by a satisfied reader whonow sleeps with the lights on. Enjoy.	2004-12-15
